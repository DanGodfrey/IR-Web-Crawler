history Further information  Bibliography of Thor comics The Marvel Comics superhero Thor debuted in the science fiction fantasy anthology title Journey into Mystery  83  cover date Aug  1962   created by editor plotter Stan Lee  scripter Larry Lieber  and penciller Jack Kirby  Lee in 2002 described Thor s genesis early in the Marvel pantheon  following the creation of the Hulk   H ow do you make someone stronger than the strongest person  It finally came to me  Don t make him human   make him a god  I decided readers were already pretty familiar with the Greek and Roman gods  It might be fun to delve into the old Norse legends    Besides  I pictured Norse gods looking like Vikings of old  with the flowing beards  horned helmets  and battle clubs      Journey into Mystery needed a shot in the arm  so I picked Thor     to headline the book  After writing an outline depicting the story and the characters I had in mind  I asked my brother  Larry  to write the script because I didn t have time     and it was only natural for me to assign the penciling to Jack Kirby    1  Subsequent stories of the 13 page feature  The Mighty Thor  continued to be plotted by Lee  and were variously scripted by Lieber or by Robert Bernstein  working under the pseudonym  R  Berns   Various artists penciled the feature  including Jack Kirby  Joe Sinnott  Don Heck  and Al Hartley  With Journey into Mystery  101  Feb  1964   the series began a long and definitive run by writer and co plotter Lee and penciler and co plotter Kirby that lasted until the by then retitled Thor  also called The Mighty Thor   179  Aug  1970   2  The five page featurette  Tales of Asgard  was added in Journey into Mystery  97  Oct  1963   followed by  The Mighty Thor  becoming the dominant cover logo with issue  104  May 1964   The feature itself expanded to 18 pages in  105  which eliminated the remaining anthological story from each issue  it was reduced to 16 pages five issues later  Journey into Mystery was retitled Thor  per the indicia  or The Mighty Thor per most covers  2  with issue  126  March 1966    Tales of Asgard  was replaced by a five page featurette starring the Inhumans from  146 152  Nov  1967   May 1968   after which featurettes were dropped and the Thor stories expanded to Marvel s then standard 20 page length  After Kirby left the title  Neal Adams penciled issues  180 181  Sept  Oct  1970   John Buscema then became the regular artist the following issue  Buscema continued to draw the book almost without interruption until  278  Dec  1978   Lee stopped scripting soon after Kirby left  and during Buscema s long stint on the book  the stories were mostly written by Gerry Conway  Len Wein  or Roy Thomas  Thomas continued to write the book after Buscema s departure  working much of the time with the artist Keith Pollard  during this period Thomas integrated many elements of traditional Norse mythology into the title  with specific stories translated into comics form  3  Following Thomas s tenure  Thor had a changing creative team  Walt Simonson took over both writing and art as of  337  Nov  1983   Simonson s run as writer artist lasted until  367  May 1986   although he continued to write   and occasionally draw   the book until issue  382  Aug  1987   Simonson s run  which introduced the character Beta Ray Bill  was regarded as a popular and critical success  4  5  After Simonson s departure  Marvel s editor in chief at the time  Tom DeFalco  became the writer  Working primarily with artist Ron Frenz  DeFalco stayed on the book until  459  Feb  1993   As a consequence of the  Heroes Reborn  crossover story arc of the 1990s  Thor was removed from mainstream Marvel continuity and with other Marvel characters re imagined in an alternate universe for one year  The Thor title reverted to Journey into Mystery with issue  503  Nov  1996   and ran four different  sequential features   The Lost Gods    Master of Kung Fu    Black Widow  and  Hannibal King   before ceasing publication with  521  June 1998   When the character was returned to the mainstream Marvel Universe  Thor was relaunched with Thor vol  2   1  July 1998   As of issue  36  the title used dual numbering in a tribute to the original Thor series  and the caption box for said issue became  36    538  June 2001   The title ran until issue  85    587  dated December 2004  Dan Jurgens wrote the first 79 issues  with Daniel Berman and Michael Avon Oeming completing the series  The third volume debuted as Thor  1  Sept  2007   initially written by J  Michael Straczynski and penciled by Olivier Coipel  6  Beginning with what would have been vol  3   13  January 2009   the third volume reverted to issue  600  reflecting the total number of published issues from all three volumes  7  8  9 Kieron Gillen took over from Straczynski in Thor  604 with artists Billy Tan  Richard Elson and Dougie Braithwaite  10  with his final storyline finishing in issue  614  11  Afterward  Matt Fraction took over Thor in issue  615  after having been announced as starting in Thor  610 12  and  611  13  14  To coincide with the Thor film  Marvel launched a number of new series starring the character in mid 2010  These included Thor  The Mighty Avenger by Roger Langridge and Chris Samnee  15 Thor  First Thunder by Bryan J  L  Glass and Tan Eng Huat  16 Thor  For Asgard by Robert Rodi and Simone Bianchi  17  and Iron Man Thor by writing duo Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning  18  In April 2011  Thor once again reverted to its original title of Journey into Mystery with issue  622  reuniting writer Gillen and artist Braithwaite in a series of stories starring Thor s half brother  Loki  19  A new ongoing series  officially titled The Mighty Thor  kicked off the same month with writer Fraction and artist Coipel  20   edit  Fictional character biography This article s plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed  Please help improve it by removing unnecessary

needed to be taught humility and consequently placed Thor  without memories of godhood  into the body and memories of an existing  partially disabled human medical student  Donald Blake  21  After becoming a doctor and on vacation in Norway  Blake witnessed the arrival of an alien scouting party  Blake fled into a cave after they heard him and began to pursue him  After discovering Thor s disguised hammer Mjolnir  and striking it against a rock  he transformed into the thunder god  22  Defeating the aliens  Thor shared a double life with his alter ego  treating the ill in a private practice with nurse   and eventual love   Jane Foster and defending humanity from evil  Thor s presence on Earth almost immediately attracted the attention of his adoptive brother and arch foe Loki  23  who returned repeatedly to Earth in a bid to destroy Thor  24  Loki was also responsible for the emergence of three of Thor s principal foes  the Absorbing Man  25  the Wrecker  26  and the Destroyer  27  On one occasion  Loki s tactics were accidentally beneficial   although successful in using an illusion of the Hulk to draw Thor into battle  it resulted in the formation of the superhero team the Avengers  of which Thor was a founding and longstanding member  28  Thor s other early foes included the Red Army  29 Zarrko  the Tomorrow Man  30  the Radioactive Man  31  the Lava Man  32  the Cobra  33 Mister Hyde  34  the Enchantress and the Executioner 35  and the Grey Gargoyle  36  Falling in love with Jane Foster  Thor disobeyed his father and refused to return to Asgard  an act for which he was punished on several occasions  37  Thor s natural affinity for Earth was eventually revealed to be due to the fact that he was the son of the Elder Goddess Gaea  38  Although Thor initially regarded himself as a  superhero  like his teammates in the Avengers  38  Loki s machinations drew Thor into increasingly epic adventures  such as teaming with father Odin and Asgardian ally Balder against fire demon Surtur and Skagg the Storm Giant  39  and defeating an increasingly powerful Absorbing Man and proving his innocence in the  Trial of the Gods   40  This necessitates an extended leave of absence from the Avengers  41  Thor also encountered Greek God Hercules  42  who became a loyal friend  Thor also saved Hercules from fellow Olympian Pluto  43  stopped the advance of Ego the Living Planet  44  rescued Jane Foster from the High Evolutionary and defeated his flawed creation  the Man Beast  45  Odin finally relented and allowed Thor to love Jane Foster  on the proviso she pass a trial  Foster  however  panicked and Thor intervened  Although Foster failed the test  Odin returned her to Earth where she was given another chance at love  while a heartbroken Thor was introduced to Asgardian warrior Sif  46  Thor battled the Asgardian troll Ulik for the first time when he attempted to steal Mjolnir  47  defeated Avengers foe Kang the Conqueror 48  and the alien Super Skrull 49  and with Odin and his Asgardian allies engaged in a battle to the death with the Enchanters Three  50  Despite repeated attempts by Loki to destroy Thor with a series of past and new foes  Thor was victorious  and even avoids being claimed by Asgardian death goddess Hela  51  The thunder god returned to Asgard to prevent Mangog from drawing the Odinsword and ending the universe  52  learned the origin of the cosmic entity Galactus  and encountered Ego once again   53  and stopped the child like Him  who would eventually become Adam Warlock  from kidnapping Sif  54

his pawn the Abomination 56  and overpowered an outmatched Doctor Doom  57  Thor only returned to Earth sporadically  forced to deal with a constant wave of Asgardian  e g   Mangog  58  Ulik 59    godly  e g  Pluto  60   and cosmic threats  e g   Infinity  61 Xorr 62    Courtesy of the manipulation of the Elder of the Universe the Collector  63  Thor was present to aid the Avengers against their greatest foes  Graviton  64 Ultron  65 Count Nefaria 66  and ultimately Korvac 67    Thor prevented another attempt by Mangog   disguised as Odin   to draw the Odinsword  68  was saved by the intervention of ally Volstagg when the  Odin Force  became a semi sentient destructive force 69  and was rescued from death when Odin engineered a false Ragnar k  the  Twilight of the Gods   and had reporter Red Norvell die in his place battling the Midgard Serpent  70   edit  1980s Thor eventually confronted the threat of the Celestial Fourth Host  and after an extended series of encounters learned of the apparent true origin of Asgard and Odin s plans to defend Earth from the alien judges  Despite the attempt by Odin to stop the Celestials by occupying the Destroyer armour  now 2 000 feet tall as holding the life essence of every Asgardian  and wielding the Odinsword  and aided by the Uni Mind  an entity composed of the Eternals  and Thor himself  the aliens departed when presented with an offering by Gaea on behalf of the  Skymothers   e g  Frigga and Hera  of twelve perfect humans  Thor also learned Gaea was his birth mother  71  After restoring the Asgardian gods  courtesy of a gathering of energies donated by Skyfathers from other pantheons  72  Thor had a series of adventures on Earth  including encountering two Heralds of Galactus in swift succession  73  stopping Mephisto from taking human souls  74  clearing his name when framed by Asgardian god of war Tyr  75  aiding Drax the Destroyer  76  with ally Iron Man defeating the Bi Beast and Man Beast  77

creature summoned when the death gods of several pantheons temporarily merge their realms  Thor thwarted the creature   revealed to be in humanoid guise Atum  the son of Gaea  and therefore Thor s half brother   and ensured the cosmic balance was restored  80  Whilst exploring an approaching space vessel at the request of Nick Fury  Thor encountered Beta Ray Bill  who after a brief battle proved himself worthy of lifting Thor s hammer Mjolnir  After initial misunderstandings  Bill formed an alliance with the Asgardian gods  and was empowered by Odin to aid Thor and his allies in a war with an approaching army of demons 81  which was revealed to be led by fire demon Surtur  now wielding  Twilight   the gigantic  Sword of Doom   After a series of extended battles   including a battle to the death with Fafnir and thwarting the Dark Elf Malekith   the gods were finally triumphant  although during combat Odin and Surtur disappeared through a rift and were presumed dead  82  Thor

86  with allies entered Hela s realm and rescued lost mortal souls  87  Returning to Earth  Thor and Beta Ray Bill defeated the transformed Dark Elf Kurse  88  although Loki also used the power of Surtur s discarded sword to change Thor into a frog  After an adventure in Central Park  Thor managed to partially restore himself and then forced Loki to reverse the spell  89  While rescuing X Factor member Angel from torture by the mercenary team the Marauders  Thor was cursed by Hela  who made his bones as brittle as glass and unable to heal if damaged  and rendered him truly immortal and unable to die no matter how severe his injuries  90  Thor was injured again during a battle with the Absorbing Man  engineered by Loki   91  and was ultimately saved by Loki during a battle with the Dark Elves  92  Eventually forced to wear armour to protect his broken body  Thor and Loki defeated a group of Ice Giants  who sought revenge by trying to locate the Midgard Serpent  hoping it would kill the thunder god  The Giants instead found the dragon Fin Fang Foom  who was revealed to be the Midgard Serpent in disguise  Time slowed as the pair   mortal enemies due to prophecy that stated they would kill each other during Ragnar k   battle to the death  Thor killed the Serpent  although his body was completely pulverized  Loki restored the Destroyer  and after killing the Ice Giants found Thor s now liquid form  The Destroyer attempted to disintegrate the thunder god but could not do so due to Hela s curse  Thor assumed mental control of the Destroyer  and forced Hela on pain of death to restore his true form  The thunder god then broke Loki s arm as punishment for his actions  93   edit  1990s After another encounter with the Celestials on an alien world  94  Thor found Odin

Enchantress   and had a son  Magni  who upon reaching adulthood doubted his father s judgment  Wracked with guilt  Thor was drawn into battle with his former ally Tarene and the Destroyer  occupied by former foe Desak   and undid the timeline via time travel  106  When the timeline was reset  Loki revived Surtur  who forged new uru hammers for Loki s Storm Giant followers and began Ragnar k  Thor learned that Ragnarok was the result of the self styled  gods to the gods  known as Those Who Sit Above in Shadow  who feed on the cycle  Thor confronted the Norns  Fates   and severed the tapestry of Asgard s existence  After breaking the Ragnarok cycle and being advised by the Odinforce that this was his father s plan  Thor entered into hibernation  With his fate unknown to the Avengers  he was believed to be missing in action  107  Thor s hammer Mjolnir was eventually found on Earth and put under U S  Army protection  When the supervillain Doctor Doom escaped from Hell  Mjolnir fell through the dimensional plane  and Doom tried unsuccessfully to lift the hammer  Mjolnir then came into the possession of a man carrying a bag with the initials  D B   108  Donald Blake  upon touching the hammer Mjolnir  was transported to the void of non existence in which Thor resided  Blake explained that when Odin originally removed the Blake persona from Thor  109  Blake was consigned to the void that Thor now inhabited  With Odin s death  however  Blake was suddenly restored into being in New York City  Blake convinced Thor to wield Mjolnir once more  return to Earth  and renew the dual identity with Blake  Blake also revealed that Thor s fellow Asgardians still lived in the minds and hearts of mortals and only needed to be found and released  110  Thor rebuilt Asgard over the state of Oklahoma  111  112  learned of the events of the Civil War 113  and was angered that Tony Stark and others used his DNA to create a Thor clone in a battle between pro and anti registration heroes  113  He battled Stark  easily defeating him  Thor accepted an offer by Stark for Asgard to be considered a foreign embassy with diplomatic immunity granted to its inhabitants  Thor searched for his fellow Asgardians  114  and restored each with the exception of Sif  who had been trapped in the body of an old woman dying of cancer  her real form stolen by Loki  The thunder god eventually searched for his father  and located Odin in a limbo between life and death  waging constant battle with the fire demon Surtur  Odin advised his son that Thor must lead the Asgardians  115  116  During the events of the Secret Invasion  Thor rescued and healed ally Beta Ray Bill  who after being temporarily given Mjolnir  aided Thor in a battle against an invading force of alien Skrulls  117  118  Thor also participated in the final battle against the Skrull forces  and was forced to sacrifice Avenger ally the Wasp  119  Due to a deception by Loki  Thor battled and killed his grandfather Bor  and was banished from Asgard  120  121  With Thor s hammer Mjolnir damaged in that battle  Thor sought out Doctor Strange  who was only able to repair the hammer by transferring the Odinforce from Thor to Mjolnir  binding the two in a symbiotic relationship  With the repaired hammer  Thor was able to draw out the imprisoned Sif  and return her to her own body  thereby restoring Loki to his male body in the process  122  123   edit  2010s During the events of the Siege storyline  Thor rushed to the defense of Asgard against Norman Osborn and his invading Dark Avengers  Although the invading forces were ultimately defeated  Asgard itself was toppled by the Sentry  who also killed Loki  Thor was then compelled to kill the Sentry at his request  As a result of the victory  the Superhuman Registration Act was dissolved and Thor joined the rebranded Avengers  who had come to his aid during the battle  124  125  126  127  128  The next day Balder lifted Thor s exile and appointed Thor as

battle  133  At Thor s funeral  Thor and the memories of Thor are replaced by Ulik under the guise of Taranus  a new thunder god  134  135   edit  Powers and abilities Like all Asgardians  Thor is not truly immortal but relies upon periodic consumption of the Golden Apples of Idunn to sustain his extended lifespan  which to date has lasted many millennia  Being the son of Odin and the elder goddess Gaea  Thor is physically the strongest of the Asgardians  38  136  137  138  139  140  If pressed in battle  Thor is also capable of entering into a state known as the  Warrior s Madness    berserkergang  in Norwegian   which will temporarily increase his strength and stamina tenfold  although in this state he attacks friend and foe alike  141  Thor possesses a very high resistance to physical injury that approaches invulnerability  142  143  144  145  Thor also possesses keen senses  23  that allows him to track objects traveling faster than light 146  and hear cries from the other side of the planet  147  Thor has the ability to travel through time  148  149  His stamina allowed him to battle the entire Frost Giant army for nine months without any sustenance or rest  150

and reflexes  enabling him to deflect bullets with his hammer  153  Like all Asgardians he has immunity to all Earthly diseases and some resistance to magic  However  exceptionally powerful magic can overwhelm Odin s enchantment that transforms him between Asgardian and mortal forms  154  As the Norse god of Thunder  Thor can summon the elements of the storm  lightning  rain  wind  snow  and uses Mjolnir as a tool to focus this ability  although the hammer cannot command artificial weather  only natural  He can cause these weather effects all over the world and destroy entire buildings  by whirling his hammer he can also lift entire buildings with the wind  139  As the son of the Earth goddess Gaea  Thor has shown some control over the Earth  155  Thor is a superb hand to hand combatant  and also skilled in armed combat  excelling in the use of the war hammer  sword and mace  Thor possesses two items which assist him in combat  the enchanted Belt of Strength  and his mystical hammer Mjolnir  The first item doubles Thor s strength and endurance 156  while the second is used to control his weather abilities  flight  energy projection and absorption  dimensional travel  matter manipulation and the most powerful of his offensives  the God Blast  which taps into Thor s life force   157  the Thermo blast  158  and the Anti Force  which counteracts another force   159  Using Mjolnir by throwing in the desired direction and then holding on to the handle s leather loop  Thor can also fly at supersonic speeds in Earth s atmosphere and travel faster than light in space  When Thor has to transport companions and or objects to a destination by himself  he has a chariot drawn by two huge mystical goats called Toothgnasher and Toothgrinder that can fly nearly anywhere he desires almost as easily as with Mjolnir  89  He can throw an object out of Earth s atmosphere using his strength  160  and throw his hammer to Asgard from where it will return  161  When Mjolnir was damaged  Doctor Strange bound Thor s soul into Mjolnir  meaning that if the hammer were to be broken again  Thor may also die  122   edit  Supporting characters Main article  List of Thor supporting
