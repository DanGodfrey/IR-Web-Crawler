Anti Americanism From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search Anti American mural in Tehran  Iran  2004 The term Anti Americanism  or Anti American Sentiment  refers to opposition or hostility to the people  policies  culture or government of the United States  1  2  3  A range of attitudes and actions critical of or opposed to the United States have been labeled anti Americanism  and precise meaning and applicability of the term to specific cases is often disputed  4  Political scientist Brendan O Connor suggests that Anti Americanism cannot be isolated as a consistent phenomenon and that the term originated as a rough composite of stereotypes  prejudices and criticisms towards Americans or the United States  evolving to more politically and economically based criticism  French scholar Marie France Toinet says use of the term  is only fully justified if it implies systematic opposition   a sort of allergic reaction   to America as a whole   5  Discussions on anti Americanism have in most cases lacked a precise definition of what the sentiment entails  other than a general disfavor   which has led to the term being used broadly and in an impressionistic manner  resulting in the inexact impressions of the many expressions described as anti American  6  Contents 1 Etymology 2 Interpretations 3 18th and 19th centuries 3 1 Degeneracy

American  was defined as  opposed to America  or to the true interests or government of the United States  opposed to the revolution in America   7  In France the use of the noun form  antiam ricanisme  has been catalogued from 1948  8  entering ordinary political language in the 1950s  9   edit  Interpretations Interpretations of anti Americanism have often been polarized  Anti Americanism has been described by the conservative anti Communist academic Paul Hollander as  a relentless critical impulse toward American social  economic  and political institutions  traditions  and values   4  10  German newspaper publisher and political scientist Josef Joffe suggests five classic aspects of the phenomenon  reducing Americans to stereotypes  believing the United States to have an irremediably evil nature  ascribing to the U S  establishment a vast conspiratorial power aimed at utterly dominating the globe  holding the United States responsible for all the evils in the world  and seeking to limit the influence of the United States by destroying it or by cutting oneself and one s society off from its polluting products and practices  11  Other advocates of the significance of the term argue that anti Americanism represents a coherent and dangerous ideological current  comparable to anti Semitism  12  Anti Americanism has also been described as an attempt to frame the consequences of U S  policy choices as evidence of a specifically American moral failure  as opposed to what may be unavoidable failures of a complicated foreign policy that comes with superpower status  13  Its status as an   ism  is a greatly contended aspect  however  Brendon O Connor notes that studies of the topic have been  patchy and impressionistic   and often one sided attacks on anti Americanism as an irrational position  5  American academic Noam Chomsky  a prolific critic of U S  policy  asserts that the use of the term within the U S  has parallels with methods employed by totalitarian states or military dictatorships  he compares the term to  anti Sovietism   a label used by the Kremlin to suppress dissident or critical thought  for instance  14  15  16  17   The concept  anti American  is an interesting one  The counterpart is used only in totalitarian states or military dictatorships    Thus  in the old Soviet Union  dissidents were condemned as  anti Soviet   That s a natural usage among people with deeply rooted totalitarian instincts  which identify state policy with the society  the people  the culture  In contrast  people with even the slightest concept of democracy treat such notions with ridicule and contempt  18  Some have attempted to recognize both positions  French academic Pierre Guerlain has argued that the term represents two very different tendencies   One systematic or essentialist  which is a form of prejudice targeting all Americans  The other refers to the way criticisms of the United States are labeled  anti American  by supporters of U S  policies in an ideological bid to discredit their opponents   19  Guerlain argues that these two  ideal types  of anti Americanism can sometimes merge  thus making discussion of the phenomenon particularly difficult  Other scholars have suggested that a plural of anti Americanisms  specific to country and time period  more accurately describe the phenomenon than any broad generalization  20  The widely used  anti American sentiment   meanwhile  less explicitly implies an ideology or belief system  Globally  increases in perceived anti American attitudes appear to correlate with particular policies or actions  21  such as the Vietnam and Iraq 22  wars  For this reason  critics sometimes argue the label is a propaganda term that is used to dismiss any censure of the United States as irrational  23   edit  18th and 19th centuries  edit  Degeneracy thesis Georges Louis Leclerc  Comte de Buffon  a leading French naturalist  developed the  degeneracy thesis  in the mid eighteenth century  It held that the American landmasses were inferior to Europe and in decline due to atmospheric conditions  citation needed  In the mid  to late eighteenth century  a theory emerged among some European intellectuals that the New World landmasses were inherently inferior to Europe  The so called  degeneracy thesis  held that climatic extremes  humidity and other atmospheric conditions in America physically weakened both men and animals  24  3 19 Some authors such as James W  Ceaser and Philippe Roger  have interpreted this theory as  a kind of prehistory of anti Americanism   25  26  and have  in the words of Philippe Roger  been a historical  constant  since the 18th century  or again an endlessly repetitive  semantic block   Others  like Jean Fran ois Revel  have examined what lay hidden behind this  fashionable  ideology  27  Purported evidence for the idea included the smallness of American fauna  dogs that ceased to bark  and venomous plants  28  one theory put forth was that the New World had emerged from the Biblical flood later than the Old World  29 Native Americans were also held to be feeble  small  and without ardor  30  The theory originated with Comte de Buffon  a leading French naturalist  in his Histoire Naturelle  1766   30  The French writer Voltaire joined Buffon and others in making the argument  28  Dutchman Cornelius de Pauw  court philosopher to Frederick II of Prussia became its leading proponent  25  While Buffon focused on the American biological environment  de Pauw attacked people native to the continent  29  James Ceaser has noted that the denouncement of America as inferior to Europe was in part motivated by the German government s fear of mass emigration  de Pauw called on to convince the Germans that the new world was inferior  De Pauw is also known to have influenced the philosopher Immanuel Kant in a similar direction  31  The theory was extended to argue that the natural environment of the United States would prevent it from ever producing true culture  Paraphrasing de Pauw  the French Encyclopedist Abb  Raynal wrote   America has not yet produced a good poet  an able mathematician  one man of genius in a single art or a single science   32  The theory was debated and rejected by early American thinkers such as Alexander Hamilton  Benjamin Franklin  and Thomas Jefferson  Jefferson  in his Notes on the State of Virginia  1781   provided a detailed rebuttal of de Buffon  25  Hamilton also vigorously rebuked the idea in Federalist No  11  1787   30  One critic  citing Raynal s ideas  suggests that it was specifically extended to the English colonies that would become the United States  33  Roger suggests that the idea of degeneracy posited a symbolic  as well as a scientific America  that would evolve beyond the original thesis  He argues that Buffon s ideas formed the root of a  stratification of negative discourses  that has recurred throughout the two countries  relationship  and has been matched by persistent anti Gallic sentiment in the United States   26   edit  Culture A 1950 Soviet propaganda poster by Nikolay Dolgorukov and Boris Efimov depicting alleged lack of freedoms in the United States  Freedom of the press is depicted as William Randolph Hearst spreading lies  Freedom of thought is depicted as judge giving a verdict for communist beliefs  Personal freedom is depicted as the lynching of blacks by the Ku Klux Klan  Freedom of assembly is depicted as Riot control  and Freedom of speech is depicted as the Statue of Liberty with her mouth padlocked shut  According to Brendan O Connor  some Europeans criticized Americans for lacking  taste  grace and civility  and having a brazen and arrogant character  5  British author Frances Trollope observed in her 1832 book Domestic Manners of the Americans that the greatest difference between England and the United States was  want of refinement    explaining that  that polish which removes the coarser and rougher parts of our nature is unknown and undreamed of  in America  34  35  According to one source her account  succeeded in angering Americans more than any book written by a foreign observer before or since   36  English writer Captain Marryat s critical account in his Diary in America  with Remarks on Its Institutions  1839  also proved controversial  especially in Detroit where an effigy of the author  along with his books  was committed to the flames  36  Other writers critical of American culture and manners included the bishop Talleyrand in France and Charles Dickens in England  5  Dickens  novel Martin Chuzzlewit  1844  is a ferocious satire on American life  24  42 Simon Schama says   By the end of the nineteenth century  the stereotype of the ugly American voracious  preachy  mercenary  and bombastically chauvinist was firmly in place in Europe   37  O Connor suggests that such prejudices were rooted in an idealised image of European refinement and that the notion of high European culture pitted against American vulgarity has not disappeared  5   edit  Politics and ideology The young United States also faced criticism on political and ideological grounds  Ceaser argues that the Romantic strain of European thought and literature  hostile to the Enlightenment view of reason and obsessed with history and national character  disdained the rationalistic American project  The German poet Nikolaus Lenau commented   With the expression Bodenlosigkeit  absence of ground   I think I am able to indicate the general character of all American institutions  what we call Fatherland is here only a property insurance scheme   Ceaser argues in his essay that such comments often repurposed the language of degeneracy  and the prejudice came to focus solely on the United States and not Canada and Mexico  25  Lenau had emigrated to the United States in 1833 and found that the country did not live up to his ideals  leading him to return to Germany the following year  His experiences in the USA were the subject of a novel entitled Tired of America  Der Amerika M de   1855  by fellow German Ferdinand K rnberger  38  The nature of American democracy was also questioned  The sentiment was that the country lacked   a  monarch  aristocracy  strong traditions  official religion  or rigid class system   according to Rubin  and its democracy was attacked by some Europeans in the early nineteenth century as degraded  a travesty  and a failure  35  The French Revolution  which was loathed by many European conservatives  also implicated the United States and the idea of creating a constitution on abstract and universal principles  25  That the country was intended to be a bastion of liberty was also seen as fraudulent given that it had been established with slavery  37   How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes   asked Samuel Johnson in 1775  39  He famously stated that   I am willing to love all mankind  except an American   35  Charles Dickens stated   The heaviest blow ever dealt at liberty will be dealt by this country  America   in the failure of its example to the earth   40  C Lawson  amp  J Hudson have described Ceaser s account  extreme   41   edit  20th century  edit  Fascist critiques A 1944 Nazi propaganda poster aimed at the Dutch with the words   The U S A  will save European culture from destruction  Drawing on the ideas of Arthur de Gobineau  1816 1882   European fascists decried the supposed degenerating effect of immigration on the racial mix of the American population  The Nazi philosopher Alfred Rosenberg argued that race mixture in the United States made it inferior to countries like Germany  which had a supposedly pure bred racial stock  24  91 2 Anti Semitism was another factor in these critiques  The belief that America was ruled by a Jewish conspiracy was common in countries ruled by fascists before and during World War II  24  91 7 The Jews  the assumed puppet masters behind American plans for world domination  were also seen as using jazz in a crafty plan to eliminate racial distinctions  24  91 7 However  despite this belief  Adolf Hitler did not count America as a credible adversary of the Third Reich because of its incoherent racial mix  he saw Americans as a  mongrel race    half Judaised  and  half Negrified   24  94 7 In an address to the Reichstag on December 11  1941  Hitler declared war on the United States and lambasted U S  President Franklin D  Roosevelt   He  Roosevelt  was strengthened in this  political diversion  by the circle of Jews surrounding him  who  with Old Testament like fanaticism  believe that the United States can be the instrument for preparing another Purim for the European nations that are becoming increasingly anti Semitic  It was the Jew  in his full Satanic vileness  who rallied around this man  Roosevelt   but to whom this man also reached out   42   edit  21st century  edit  9 11 9 11  World Trade Center twin towers on fire  In a book called The Rise of Anti Americanism  published in 2006  Brendon O Connor and Martin Griffiths said that the September 11  2001 attacks were  quintessential anti American acts  which satisfy all of the competing definitions of Anti Americanism   43  They ask   if 9 11 can be construed as the exemplar of anti Americanism at work  does it make much sense to imply that all anti Americans are complicit with terrorism   44  Leaders in most Middle Eastern countries  including Afghanistan  condemned the attacks  Saddam Hussein s Iraq was a notable exception  with an immediate official statement that  the American cowboys are reaping the fruit of their crimes against humanity   45

the first time since tracking began in 2005  19 countries rated U S  influence positively  while six leaned negative and two were divided  46 per cent of the 27 countries polled viewed US influence positively and 34 per cent viewed it negatively   edit  Middle East  South Asia and North Africa Anti American banner of the Houthi militia  It reads  Allah is Great  Death to America  Death to Israel  Curse the Jews  Victory to Islam  After World War I  admiration was expressed for American President Woodrow Wilson s promulgation of democracy  freedom and self determination in the Fourteen Points and  during World War II  the high ideals of the Atlantic Charter received favorable notice  47  Cultural anti Americanism in the Middle East  however  may have its origins with Sayyid Qutb  Qutb  an Egyptian who was the leading intellectual of the Muslim Brotherhood  studied in Greeley  Colorado from 1948 to 1950  and wrote a book  The America I Have Seen  1951  based on his impressions  In it he decried everything in America from individual freedom and taste in music to Church socials and haircuts  48  Wrote Qutb   They danced to the tunes of the gramophone  and the dance floor was replete with tapping feet  enticing legs  arms wrapped around waists  lips pressed to lips  and chests pressed to chests  The atmosphere was full of desire     49  He offered a distorted chronology of American history and was disturbed by its sexually liberated women   The American girl is well acquainted with her body s seductive capacity  She knows it lies in the face  and in expressive eyes  and thirsty lips  She knows seductiveness lies in the round breasts  the full buttocks  and in the shapely thighs  sleek legs   and she shows all this and does not hide it   49  He was particularly disturbed by jazz  which he called the American s preferred music  and which  was created by Negroes to satisfy their love of noise and to whet their sexual desires      50  Qutb s writings influenced generations of militants and radicals in the Middle East who viewed America as a cultural temptress bent on overturning traditional customs and morals  especially with respect to the relations between the sexes  As Paul Hollander has written   The most obvious and clear link between anti Americanism and modernization is encountered in Islamic countries and other traditional societies where modernization clashes head on with entrenched traditional beliefs  institutions  and patterns of behavior  and where it challenges the very meaning of life  social relations  and religious verities  What becomes of the world when women can go to work and show large surfaces of skin to men they are not related to  In a recent case  the indignant male members of a Kurdish family in Sweden were  provoked  by the transgressing female of their family who had the temerity to have a job and a boyfriend and dress in Western ways  She was finally killed by her father   4  Hollander went on to explain   In Arab countries and among Muslim populations  anti Americanism is not only the monopoly of intellectuals but also a widespread disposition of the masses  In these areas  traditional religion  radical politics  and economic backwardness combine to make anti Americanism an exceptionally widespread  virulent  and reflexive response to a wide range of collective and personal frustrations and grievances and a welcome alternative to any collective or individual self examination or stock taking  More generally  it is the rise of alternatives  ushered in by modernization  that threatens traditional societies and generates anti American reaction  The stability of traditional society  like that of modern totalitarian systems  rests on the lack of alternatives  on the lack of choice  Choice is deeply subversive culturally  politically  psychologically  The recent outburst of murderous anti Americanism has added a new dimension to the phenomenon  or at any rate  throws into relief the intense hatred it may encapsulate  The violence of September 11 shows that when anti Americanism is nurtured by the kind of indignation and resentment that in  turn  is stimulated and sanctioned by religious convictions  it can become spectacularly destructive   4  Qutb s ideas influenced Osama Bin Laden  an anti American Islamic militant from Saudi Arabia  who was believed to be the founder of the Jihadist organization Al Qaeda  51  52  In conjunction with several other Islamic militant leaders  bin Laden issued two fatawa in 1996 and then again in 1998 that Muslims should kill military personnel from the United States until they withdraw military forces from Islamic countries and withdraw support for Israel  53  54  After the 1996 fatwa  entitled  Declaration of War against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places   bin Laden was put on a criminal file by the U S  Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI  under an American Civil War statute which forbids instigating violence and attempting to overthrow the U S  government  55  56  He has also been indicted in United States federal court for his alleged involvement in the 1998 U S  embassy bombings in Dar es Salaam  Tanzania and Nairobi  Kenya  and was on the FBI s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list  Bin Laden  on behalf of Al Qaeda  has allegedly claimed responsibility for the September 11  2001 attacks in videos released to the public  57  58  On 14 January 2009  bin Laden vowed to continue the fight and open up new fronts against the U S  on behalf of the Islamic world  59  In 2002 and in mid 2004 Zogby International polled the favorable unfavorable ratings of the U S  in Saudi Arabia  Egypt  Jordan  Lebanon  Morocco  and the United Arab Emirates  UAE   In Zogby s 2002 survey  76  of Egyptians had a negative attitude toward the United States  compared with 98  in 2004  In Morocco  61  viewed the country unfavorably in 2002  but in two years  that number had jumped to 88 percent  In Saudi Arabia  such responses rose from 87  in 2002 to 94  in 2004  Attitudes were virtually unchanged in Lebanon but improved slightly in the UAE  from 87  who said in 2002 that they disliked the United States to 73  in 2004  60  However  most of these countries mainly objected to foreign policies that they considered unfair  60  According to Tamim Ansary  in Destiny

in use in Iran since at least the Iranian revolution in 1979  61  62  along with other phrases often represented as anti American  A 1953 coup which involved the CIA was cited as a grievance  63  State sponsored murals characterised as anti American dot the streets of Tehran  64  65  It has been suggested that under Ayatollah Khomeini anti Americanism was little more than a way to distinguish between domestic supporters and detractors  and even the phrase  Great Satan  66  which has previously been associated with anti Americanism  appears to now signify either the United States or the United Kingdom  67  68   edit  Pakistan Main article  Anti American sentiment in Pakistan Negative attitudes towards the USA s influence on the world has risen in Pakistan as a result of U S  drone

 jointly alongside Serbia  71   edit  Europe Banner expressing anti American sentiments in Stockholm  Sweden in 2006  In a 2003 article  historian David Ellwood identified what he called three great roots of anti Americanism  Representations  images and stereotypes  from the birth of the Republic onwards  The challenge of economic power and the American model of modernization  principally from the 1910s and 1920s on  The organized projection of U S  political  strategic and ideological power  from World War II on  He went on to say that expressions of the phenomenon in the last 60 years have contained ever changing combinations of these elements  the configurations depending on internal crises within the groups or societies articulating them as much as anything done by American society in all its forms  72  In 2004  Sergio Fabbrini wrote that the perceived post 9 11 unilateralism of the 2003 invasion of Iraq fed deep rooted anti American feeling in Europe  bringing it to the surface  In his article  he highlighted European fears surrounding the Americanization of the economy  culture and political process of Europe  73  In her contribution to the seminal book Anti Americanisms in World Politics edited by Peter Katzenstein and Robert Keohane in 2006  Sophie Meunier writes about French anti Americanism  She contends that although it has a long history  older than the U S  itself  and is the most easily recognizable anti Americanism in Europe  it may not have had real policy consequences on the United States and thus may have been less damaging than more pernicious and invisible anti Americanism in other countries  74  Anti war demonstration against a visit by George W  Bush to London in 2008  During the George W  Bush administration  public opinion of America declined in most European countries  A Pew Global Attitudes Project poll showed  favourable opinions  of America between 2000 and 2006 dropping from 83  to 56  in the United Kingdom  from

unhappiness with the lack of American support during Dien Bien Phu  for the French left  it was the Vietnam War and U S   imperialism  that were the sources of resentment  77  Much later  the alleged weapons of mass destruction affair certainly dirtied the previously favourable image  In 2008  85  of the French people considered the American government and banks to be most liable for the Financial

 and  monopoly capitalist groups   83  The Taiwanese Strait Crisis has led China to blame the U S  for any issues that arise in the bilateral relationship between China and Taiwan  as they believe that American support of Taiwan is an effort to weaken their country  84  Recently  in 2009  Luo Ping criticized America s laissez faire capitalism and said that he hated America when the United States Treasury would start to print money and depreciate the value of the dollar  thus cheapening the value of China s purchase of U S  bonds  85  Chinese hackers have also conducted extensive cyberwarfare against American institutions and citizens 86  87  88  88  targeting the U S  and its Western allies  89  90  Furthermore  China s leaders present their country as an alternative to the meddling power of the West  91   edit  Japan In Japan  objections to the behavior and presence of American military personnel are sometimes reported as anti Americanism  such as the 1995 Okinawan rape incident  92  93  The ongoing U S  military presence in Okinawa remains a contentious issue in Japan  94  While protests have arisen over specific incidents  they are often reflective of deeper historical resentments  Robert Hathaway  director of the Wilson Center s Asia program  suggests   the growth of anti American sentiment in both Japan and South Korea must be seen not simply as a response to American policies and actions  but as reflective of deeper domestic trends and developments within these Asian countries   95  In Japan  a variety of threads have contributed to anti Americanism in the post war era  including pacifism on the left  nationalism on the right  and opportunistic worries over American influence in Japanese economic life  96   edit  South Korea See also  Anti American sentiment in Korea Speaking to the Wilson Center  Katherine Moon notes that while the majority of South Koreans support the American alliance  anti Americanism also represents the collective venting of accumulated grievances that in many instances have lain hidden for decades   95  In the 1990s Scholars  policy makers and the media noted that anti Americanism was motivated by the rejection of authoritarianism and a resurgent nationalism  this nationalist Anti Americanism continued into the 2000s fuelled by a number of incidents such as the  IMF  crisis  97   Fucking USA  is an anti American protest song written by South Korean singer and activist Yoon Min suk  Strongly anti US Foreign policy and anti Bush  the song was written in 2002 at a time when  following the Apolo Ohno Olympic controversy and an incident in which two Korean middle school students were killed under the wheels of a U S  Army vehicle  anti American sentiment in South Korea reached high levels  98  However  by 2009  a majority of South Koreans were reported as having a favorable view of the United States  99   edit  Australia In a poll taken by US magazine Reader s Digest with 1000

such as this  In Latin America  anti American sentiment has deep roots dating back to the 1830s and the 1836 Texas Revolution  in which the province seceded from Mexico  102  Nine years later  encouraged by the Monroe Doctrine and Manifest Destiny  the United States annexed the Republic of Texas at its request  but against vehement opposition by Mexico  which refused to recognize Texas  independence and began its aggressive expansion into Western North America  103  53 4  57 8 Mexican anti American sentiment was further inflamed by the resulting 1846 1848 Mexican American War  in which Mexico lost more than half of its territory to the U S  103  57 8 104  The Chilean writer Francisco Bilbao predicted in America in Danger  1856  that the loss of Texas and northern Mexico to  the talons of the eagle  was just a foretaste of an American bid for world domination  24  104 Such interventions from the USA prompted a later ruler of Mexico  Porfirio Diaz  to lament  Poor Mexico  so far from God  and so close to the United States   24  104 Mexico s National Museum of Interventions  opened in 1981  is a testament to Mexico s sense of grievance with the United States  24  121 The 1855 American intervention in Nicaragua and the Spanish American War of 1898  which turned Cuba into a virtual dependency of the United States  in the context of the Big Stick ideology espoused by Theodore Roosevelt s corollary to the Monroe Doctrine that led to numerous interventions in Central America and the Caribbean  also prompted hatred of the US in other regions of the Americas  105  A very influential formulation of Latin American anti Americanism  engendered by the 1898 war  was the Uruguayan journalist Jos  Enrique Rod  s essay Ariel  1900  in which the spiritual values of the South American Ariel are contrasted to the brutish mass culture of the American Caliban  This essay had enormous influence throughout Spanish America in the 1910s and 1920s  and prompted resistance to what was seen as American cultural imperialism  106  Perceived racist attitudes of the white Anglo Saxon Protestants of the North towards the populations of Latin America also caused resentment  107   Uncle Sam wants you DEAD   by Carlos Latuff In the twentieth century  American support for the 1954 Guatemalan coup d  tat against the democratically elected President Jacobo Arbenz Guzm n fueled anti Americanism in the region  108  109  110  This CIA sponsored coup prompted a former president of that country  Juan Jos  Ar valo to write a fable entitled The Shark and the Sardines  1961  in which a predatory shark  representing the USA  overawes the sardines of Latin America  24  114 Vice President Richard Nixon s tour of South America in 1958 prompted a spectacular eruption of anti Americanism  The tour became the focus of violent protests which climaxed in Caracas  Venezuela where Nixon was almost killed by a raging mob as his motorcade drove from the airport to the city  111  In response  President Dwight D  Eisenhower assembled troops at Guantanamo Bay and a fleet of battleships in the Caribbean to intervene to save Nixon if necessary  112  826 34 Fidel Castro  the revolutionary leader of Cuba  has throughout his career tried to co ordinate long standing Latin American resentments against the USA through military and propagandist means  113  114  He was aided in this goal by the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba in 1961  planned and implemented by the American government against his regime  This disaster ruined American credibility in the Americas and gave a boost to her critics worldwide  112  893 907 According to Rubin and Rubin  Castro s Second Declaration of Havana  in February 1962   constituted a declaration of war on the United States and the enshrinement of a new theory of anti Americanism   24  115 Castro called America  a vulture   feeding on humanity  112  862 The United States embargo against Cuba maintained resentment and Castro s colleague  the famed revolutionary Che Guevara  expressed his hopes during the Vietnam War of  creating a Second or a Third Vietnam  in the Latin American region against the designs of what he believed to be US imperialism  115  Immigrant rights march for amnesty in downtown Los Angeles  California on May Day  2006  The 1964 Brazilian coup d  tat  the invasion of the Dominican Republic in 1965  US involvement in Operation Condor  the 1973 Chilean and 1976 Argentine Coup d  tats  and the Salvadoran Civil War  the support of the Contras  the training of terrorists and war criminals in the School of the Americas and the refusal to extradite a terrorist  U S  support for dictators such as Augusto Pinochet  Anastasio Somoza  Alfredo Stroessner and pre 1989 Manuel Noriega have continued to influence regional attitudes in a negative way  116  108  109  110  The perceived failures of the neo liberal reforms of the 1980s and the 1990s intensified opposition to the Washington consensus  117  leading to a resurgence in support for Pan Americanism  support for popular movements in the region  the nationalization of key industries and centralization of government  118  America s tightening of the economic embargo on Cuba in 1996 and 2004 also caused resentment among Latin American leaders and has prompted them to use the Rio Group and the Madrid based Ibero American Summits as meeting places rather than the American dominated OAS  119  This trend has been reinforced through the creation of a series of regional political bodies such as Unasur and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States  and a strong opposition to the materialization of the Washington sponsored Free Trade Area of the Americas at the 2005 4th Summit of the Americas  Furthermore  the renewal of the concession for the U S  military base in Manta  Ecuador was met by considerable criticism  derision  and even doubt by the supporters of such an expansion  120  The near war sparked by the 2008 Andean diplomatic crisis was expressed by a high level Ecuadorean military officer as being carried under American auspices  The officer said  a large proportion of senior officers   share  the conviction that the United States was an accomplice in the attack   launched on by the Colombian military on a FARC camp in Ecuador  near the Colombian border   121  The Ecuadorean military retaliated by stating the 10 year lease on the base  which expired in November 2009  would not be renewed and that the U S  military presence was expected to be scaled down starting three months before the expiry  122   edit  Canada Anti Americanism in Canada has unique historic roots  When the Continental Congress was called in 1774  an invitation was sent to Quebec  also called Canada  and Nova Scotia  However Canadians expressed little interest in joining the Congress  and the following year the American army invaded Canada  but was defeated at the Battle of Quebec  Although the American Articles of Confederation later pre approved Canada as a U S  state  public opinion had turned against them  Soon 40 000 loyalist refugees arrived from the United States  including 2 000 Black Loyalists  many of whom had fought for the Crown against the American Revolution  To them the republic they left behind was violent and anarchic  ruled by money and mob rule  123  Brendon O Connor  amp  Martin Griffiths state in their book Anti Americanism that they would at first glance think that Canadians seem as likely as others to embrace characteristics that are characterised as anti American  O Conner and Griffiths include such actions as criticising Americans as a people  or the US as a country as being anti American often demonising  denigrating and resorting to stereotypes  They have also written that the Anti Americanism found in Canada had unique qualities  nowhere else has it been so entrenched for so long  nor so central to the political culture as in Canada  124  Canadian historian Kim Richard Nossal thinks that a low level attenuated form of anti Americanism permeates Canadian political culture  though  designed primarily as a means to differentiate Canadians from Americans    124  Although J L Granatstien has suggested that Anti Americanism was dead in Canada  John Herd Thompson and Stephen J  Randall in their book Canada and the United States  2002  states that there is anecdotal evidence that it still flourishes  and that it continues to nourish the Canadian sense of identity  125  It does help Canadians differentiate themselves from Americans  but it is also directly correlated to American Anti Canadianism  citation needed   edit  See also United States portal Allegations of state terrorism by the United States American imperialism How the World Sees
