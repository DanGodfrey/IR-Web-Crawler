just under 400 km north of Tenerife  Canary Islands  in the north Atlantic Ocean and an outermost region of the European Union  6  The archipelago comprises the major part of one of the two Autonomous regions of Portugal  the other being the Azores located to the northwest   that includes the islands of Madeira  Porto Santo  and the Desertas  administered together with the separate archipelago of the Savage Islands  Madeira was re discovered by Portuguese sailors in the service of Infante D  Henrique  Henry the Navigator  in 1419  and settled after 1420  The archipelago is considered to be the first territorial discovery of the exploratory period of the Portuguese Age of Discovery  Today  it is a popular year round resort  being visited every year by about one million tourists  7  noted for its Madeira wine  flowers  landscapes and embroidery artisans  as well as for its annual New Year celebrations that feature the largest fireworks show in the world  as officially recognized by the Guinness World Records  in 2006  8  9  The main harbour in Funchal is the leading Portuguese port in cruise liner dockings  10  being an important stopover for commercial and trans Atlantic passenger cruises between Europe  the Caribbean and North America  Madeira is currently the second richest region in Portugal  after Lisbon  with a GDP per capita of 103  of the European average  11  Contents 1

alves Zarco  edit  Exploration Pliny mentioned certain  Purple Islands   their position corresponding to the location of the Fortunate Isles  or Canary Islands   that may have referred to islands of Madeira  Plutarch  Sertorius  75 AD  referring to the military commander Quintus Sertorius  d  72 BC   relates that after his return to C diz      The islands are said to be two in number separated by a very narrow strait and lie 10 000 furlongs from Africa  They are called the Isles of the Blessed  The estimated distance from Africa  2 000 kilometres 1 250 miles   and the closeness of the two islands  seem to describe the similar position of the islands of Madeira and Porto Santo   edit  Legend There is also a romantic tale of two lovers  Robert Machim and Anna d Arfet  during the reign of King Edward III of England  who  fleeing from England to France in 1346  were driven off their course by a violent storm  Their ship crashed along the coast of an island  that may have been Madeira  later  this story would be used in the naming of Machico  whose name was transliterated from the name of the boy in the tale  in memory of the young lovers  12   edit  Discovery Much like the Azores  it is clear that some knowledge of Atlantic islands  such as Madeira  existed before the discovery and settlement of these lands  as the islands appear on maps as early as 1339  13  From a portolan dating to 1351  and preserved in Florence  Italy  it would appear that the islands of Madeira had been discovered  long before Portuguese vessels rediscovered them in the  official  timeline  In Libro del Conocimiento  1348 1349   a Spanish monk also identified the location of the islands in its present location  with the names Leiname  Diserta and Puerto Santo  Officially  in 1418  two captains under service to Prince Henry the Navigator  Jo o Gon alves Zarco and Trist o Vaz Teixeira  were driven off course by a storm to an island which they named Porto Santo  English  holy harbour   the name was bestowed for their gratitude and divine deliverance from a possible shipwreck by the protected anchorage  The following year  an organized expedition  under the captaincy of Zarco and Vaz Teixeira  was sent to this new land  and along with captain Bartolomeu Perestrello  to take possession of the island on behalf of the Portuguese crown  Consequently  the new settlers discovered  a heavy black cloud suspended to the southwest   14  which when explored they discovered the larger island of Madeira  15   edit  Settlement The first settlers began colonizing the islands around 1420 or 1425  the three Captains major had led the first settlement  along with their respective families  a small group of minor nobility  people of modest conditions and some prisoners  who could be trusted to work the lands  To gain the minimum conditions for the development of agriculture  they had to rough hew a part of the dense forest of laurisilva and to construct a large number of canals  levadas   since in some parts of the island there was excess water  while in others water was scarce  During this period  fish constituted about half of the settlers  diet  together with vegetables and fruits cultivated from small cleared parcels of land  Initially  these colonists produced wheat for their own subsistence  but later the quantity cultivated was sufficient to begin exporting wheat to continental Portugal  In 23 September 1433  the name Ilha da Madeira  English  Madeira Island  or literally island of wood  began to appear in the first documents and maps  The name given to the islands corresponded to the large dense forests of native laurisilva trees that populated the island during the settlement  However  when grain production began to fall  the ensuing crisis forced Henry the Navigator  as principal benefactor of the islands  to plant other commercial crops  The planting of sugarcane  and later Sicilian sugar beet  allowed the introduction of the  sweet salt   as sugar was known  into Europe  where it was a rare and popular spice  These specialized plants  and their associated industrial technology  created one of the major revolutions on the islands and fueled Portuguese industry  The expansion of sugar plantations in Madeira began in 1455  using advisers from Sicily and financed by Genoese capital  it would become an integral part of the island economy until the 17th century   The accessibility of Madeira attracted Genoese and Flemish traders who were keen to bypass Venetian monopolies   By 1480 Antwerp had some seventy ships engaged in the Madeira sugar trade  with the refining and distribution concentrated in Antwerp  By the 1490s Madeira had overtaken Cyprus as a producer of sugar   16  Sugarcane production was the primary engine of the island s economy  increasing the demand for labour  Slaves were used during portions of the island s history to cultivate sugar cane  and the proportion of imported slaves reached 10  of the total population of Madeira by the 16th century  17  In 1617  Algerian pirates  having long enslaved Christians along the Mediterranean coasts  captured 1 200 men and women in Porto Santo  18  19  After the 17th century  as sugar production shifted to Brazil  S o Tom  and Pr ncipe and elsewhere  Madeira s most important product became its wine  The British occupied Madeira as a result of the Napoleonic Wars  a friendly occupation starting in 1807 and concluding in 1814 when the island was returned to Portugal  20  When  after the death of King John VI of Portugal  his usurper son Miguel of Portugal seized power from the rightful heir  his niece Maria II  and proclaimed himself  Absolute King   Madeira held out for the queen under the governor Jos  Travassos Valdez until Miguel sent an expeditionary force and the defence of the island was overwhelmed by crushing force  Valdez was forced to flee to England under the protection of the Royal Navy  September 1828    edit  World War I The effect on Portugal in World War I was first felt in Madeira on December 3  1916 when the German U boat  SM U 38  captained by Max Valentiner went into Funchal harbour on Madeira and torpedoed and sank 3 ships  CS Dacia  1 856 tons   21 Kanguroo  2 493 tons  22  and Surprise  680 tons   23  The commander of the French Gunboat Surprise and 34 of her crew  7 Portuguese  died in the attack  The Dacia  a British cable laying vessel  24  had previously undertaken war work off the coast of Casablanca and Dakar  was in the process of diverting the German South American cable into Brest  France  Following the attack on the ships  the Germans proceeded to bombard Funchal for two hours from a range of about 2 miles  Batteries on Madeira returned fire and eventually forced the Germans to withdraw  In 1917 on December 12  2 German U boats  SM U 156 and SM U 157  captained by Max Valentiner  again bombarded Funchal  Madeira  This time the attack lasted around 30 minutes  Forty  4 7 inch  120 mm  and 5 9 inch  150 mm  shells were fired  There were 3 fatalities and 17 wounded  In addition  a number of houses and Santa Clara church were hit  Charles I  Blessed Charles of Austria  the last Emperor of the Austro Hungarian Empire went into exile in Madeira  after his second unsuccessful coup d  tat in Hungary  He died there on April 1  1922 and is buried in Monte  Charles I had tried in 1917 to secretly enter into peace negotiations with France  Although his foreign minister  Ottokar Czernin  was only interested in negotiating a general peace which would include Germany as well  Charles himself  in negotiations with the French with his brother in law  Prince Sixtus of Bourbon Parma  an officer in the Belgian Army  as intermediary  went much further in suggesting his willingness to make a separate peace  When news of the overture leaked in April 1918  Charles denied involvement until the French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau published letters signed by him  This led to Czernin s resignation  forcing Austria Hungary into an even more dependent position with respect to its seemingly wronged German ally  Determined to prevent a restoration attempt  the Council of Allied Powers had agreed on Madeira because it was isolated in the Atlantic and easily guarded  25   edit  Autonomy On 1 July 1976  following the democratic revolution of 1974  Portugal granted political autonomy to Madeira  celebrated on Madeira Day  The region now has its own government and legislative assembly   edit  Geography  edit  Physical geography Madeira Island  Ilha  A

flight from the Portuguese capital of Lisbon 26    It is found in the extreme south of the Tore Madeira Ridge  a bathymetric structure of great dimensions oriented along a north northeast to south southwest axis that extends for 1000 kilometres  This submarine structure consists of long geomorphological relief that extends from the abyssal plain to 3500 meters  its highest submersed point is at a depth of about 150 meters  around latitude 36 N   The origins of the Tore Madeira Ridge are not clearly established  but may have resulted from a morphological buckling of the lithosphere  27  28  The archipelago itself is a series of oceanic volcanic islands that date back to the Miocene  about 20 million years ago   and constructed from a hotspot in the Earth s crust of the African Tectonic Plate  Madeira  and the smaller Desertas Islands  are the youngest of these islands  dating from 4 6 to 0 7 million years   while Porto Santo  the smaller of the main islands  is the oldest  approximately 14 million years   Since their immersion  there have been five phases related to the volcanism of the group  and they are particularly visible on the island of Madeira  which include  Base formation   characterised by large eruptions and ejecta which terminated about three million years ago  Peripheral formation   where there is a diminishing level of the projectiles  causing the formation of several dykes and platforms  that terminated about 740 000 years ago  High altitude formation   marked by a continuation of projectiles  pyroclastic materials and the formation of faults along the northern and southern coasts  between 400 900 meters   Paul da Serra   formation that travelled along the Bica da Cana around 550 000 years ago  Recent eruptions  associated with minor

is at the top of a massive shield volcano that rises about 6 km  3 7 mi  from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean  on the Tore underwater mountain range  The volcano formed atop an east west rift 29  30  in the oceanic crust along the African Plate  beginning during the Miocene epoch over 5 million years ago  continuing into the Pleistocene until about 700 000 years ago  31  This was followed by extensive erosion  producing two large amphitheatres open to south in the central part of the island  Volcanic activity later resumed  producing scoria cones and lava flows atop the older eroded shield  The most recent volcanic eruptions were on the west central part of the island only 6 500 years ago  creating more cinder cones and lava flows  31  Madeira Island represents 93  of the archipelago s area  with 90  of the landmass above 500 m  It is the largest island of the group with an area of 741 km2  286 sq mi   a length of 57 km  35 mi   from Ponte de S o Louren o to Ponte do Pargo   while approximately 22 km  14 mi  at its widest point  from Ponte da Cruz to Ponte S o Jorge   with a coastline of 150 km  93 21 mi   It has a mountain ridge that extends along the center of the island  reaching 1862 meters  6 107 ft  at its highest point  Pico Ruivo   while much lower  below 200 meters  along its eastern extent  The primitive volcanic foci responsible for the central mountainous area  consisted of the peaks  Ruivo  1862 meter   Torres  1851 meter   Areeiro  1818 meter   Cidr o  1802 meter   Cedro  1759 meter   Casado  1725 meter   Grande  1657 meter   Ferreiro  1582 meter   At the end of this eruptive phase  an island circled by reefs was formed  its marine vistiges are evident in a calcierous layer in the area of Lameiros  in S o Vicente  which was later explored for calcium oxide production   Sea cliffs  such as Cabo Gir o  valleys and ravines extend from this central spine  making the interior generally inaccessible  32  Daily life has concentrated in the many villages at the mouths of the ravines  through which the heavy rains of autumn and winter usually travel to the sea  33  A long  narrow  and comparatively low rocky promontory forms  Paul da Serra  the western extremity of the island  on which lies a tract of calcareous sand known  1300 1500 meter   It is a fossil bed  that contains shells and numerous bodies resembling the roots of trees  probably produced by infiltration  The island was formed from a base volcanic complex  forming to two massifs  The Base Volcanic Complex   was formed during the Miocene period from submarine and sub aerial eruptions in the central part of the island  and is associated with some of the deeper valleys  S o Vicente  Boaventura  Socorridos   The complex extends to the east into the  Porto da Cruz and Machico  ravines until Ponta de S o Louren o and consists of accumulated block pyroclasts  lapilli and ash  layered with basaltic lava  The volcanic material is essentially effusive  of non viscous compact basalts  the lava formed flows that were not dense which covered the topography and substrata  These first flows were extensive  occupying a large part of the plateau  filling many of the valleys and ending at the sea  More recent episodes were confined into the valley of the S o Vicente  Seixal and Porto Moniz ravines  The basaltic flows correspond to the last period of volcanic activity on Madeira  around  5  2 millions of years   The flows were boxed into the valleys  and fossilized  sometimes  such as in the valley of S o Vicente  forming morphological terraces  The island is covered in faults  and easily identifiable in the area around Ribeira Brava  near Encumeada  The spatial distribution of these faults is varied and their align is also diverse  although it is common to encounter some faults from west northwest to east south southeast to northwest to southeast  coincident with the direction of some volcanic cones   Between many of pyroclastic cliffs  there exists a great variability in materials  from large blocks to fine ash  and a intermediary layer referred to locally as feijoco  or lapilli  of a consistency that is more porous  The material is normally dark to black rocks  yellow and reddish materials  and is used in some construction for their refractive characteristics  as well as used in the construction of blast ovens   Central Massif   which occupies the central region of the island  consisting of explosive material  large blocks  Lapilli and ash  and deposited chaotically around volcanic centres of the eruptions  but today mostly hidden and unrecognisable  This massif is crossed by several dense faults  basaltic and trachyte  oriented in many directions  converging on Pico Ruivo  The peak which includes many dykes  has resisted erosion  in contrast to many of the surrounding deposits  the weak cohesion of pyroclastic materials permitted the easy carving of the terrain in this area  constituting the morphology of many of the ravines  Brava  Socorridos  Machico  S o Vicente  Porco  Boaventura  and Faial  The Paul da Serra Massif   corresponds to a similar structural platform of basaltic flows oriented towards the southwest   edit  Climate Madeira has been classified as a Mediterranean climate  K ppen climate classification  Csa Csb   34  but based on differences in sun exposure  humidity  and annual mean temperature there are clear variations between north  and south facing regions  as well as between some islands  Other microclimates are expected to exist  from the constantly humid wettest points of the mountains  to the desertic and arid Selvagens islands  The islands are strongly influenced by the Gulf Stream and Canary Current  giving mild year round temperatures  according to IM the average annual temperature at Funchal weather station is 19 6  C  67 3  F  for the 1980 2010 period   For the 1960 1990 period  IM  Instituto de Meteorologia  published an article  showing that some regions

island  the original settlers set fire to the island to clear the land for farming  and gave it the name it now bears  Madeira means  wood  in Portuguese   However  in the north  the valleys contain native trees of fine growth  These laurisilva forests  notably the forests on the northern slopes of Madeira Island  are designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO  Madeira has three endemic bird species  Zino s Petrel  the Trocaz Pigeon and the Madeira Firecrest  while the Madeiran Chaffinch is an endemic subspecies  It is also important for breeding seabirds  including the Madeiran Storm petrel  North Atlantic Little Shearwater and Cory s Shearwater  The Macaronesia region harbours an important floral diversity  In fact  the archipelago s forest composition and maturity are quite similar to the forests found in the Tertiary period that covered Southern Europe and Northern Africa millions of years ago  The great biodiversity of Madeira is phytogeographically linked to the Mediterranean region  Africa  America and Australia  and interest in this phytogeography has been increasing in recent years due to the discovery of some epiphytic bryophyte species with non adjacent distribution  Madeira also has many endemic species of fauna   mostly invertebrates which include the extremely rare Madeiran Large White but also some vertebrates such as the native bat  some lizards species  and some birds as already mentioned  The biggest tarantula of Europe is found on Desertas islands of Madeira and can be as wide as a man s hand  These islands have more than 250 species of land molluscs  snails and slugs   some with very unusual shell shape and colours  most of which are endemic and vulnerable   edit  Levadas A levada The island of Madeira is wet in the northwest but dry in the southeast  In the 16th century the Portuguese started building levadas or aqueducts to carry water to the agricultural regions in the south  The most recent were built in the 1940s  Madeira is very mountainous  and building the levadas was difficult and often sentenced criminals or slaves were used  Many are cut into the sides of mountains  and it was also necessary to dig 25 miles  40 km  of tunnels  some of which are still accessible  Today the levadas not only supply water to the southern parts of the island but provide hydro electric power  There are over 1 350 miles  2 170 km  of levadas and they provide a remarkable network of walking paths  Some provide easy and relaxing walks through beautiful countryside  but others are narrow  crumbling ledges where a slip could result in serious injury or death  Two of the most popular levadas to hike are the Levada do Caldeir o Verde and the Levada do Caldeir o do Inferno which should not be attempted by hikers prone to vertigo or without torches and helmets  The Levada do Cani al is a much easier walk  running 7 1 miles  11 4 km  from Maro os to the Cani al Tunnel  It is known as the mimosa levada because mimosa trees are

located along the southern coast of the island of Madeira  It is a modern city  located within a natural geological  amphitheater  composed of volcanological structure and fluvial hydrological forces  Beginning at the harbor  Porto de Funchal   the neighborhoods and streets rise almost 1 200 metres  3 900 ft   along gentle slopes that helped to provide a natural shelter to the early settlers  With five centuries of populated history  Funchal was named by the early discoverers and settlers  for the abundance of fennel  funcho  that was found in this heavily forested area  The natural harbor and climate  combined with an excellent geographical position  allowed Funchal to rapidly grow  Its S  Cathedral  built between 1493 and 1514  by P ro Annes in Manueline style   was one of the main centers of activity during its formative period  and represents one of Madeira s numerous historical treasures   edit  Demographics When the Portuguese discovered the island of Madeira in 1419  it was uninhabited by humans  with no aboriginal population  The island was settled by Portuguese people  especially farmers from the Minho region  41  meaning that Madeirans  Portuguese  Madeirenses   as they are called  are ethnic Portuguese  though they have developed their own distinct regional identity and cultural traits  The region has a total population of just under 250 000 inhabitants  the majority of whom live on the main island of Madeira where the population density is 337 km   meanwhile only around 4 500 live on the Porto Santo Island where the population density is 112 km    edit  Population genetics As in continental Portugal  the most frequent mtDNA haplogroup in Madeira is H  36 2    followed by U  19 4  including 3 9  of North African Berber U6   T  7 7    pre HVclades  7 1   and K  6 5    Two haplogroups  H and U5 alone account for more than 50  of the individuals  The relatively high frequency of sub Saharan L and M1 haplogroups  14 8   in Madeira is also consistent with the historical records of slaves being introduced in both the south of Portugal and in Madeira  42  Sample H I J K T U  except U6  Pre V W X U6 M1 L1 L2 L3 155 36 2 1 3 2 6 6 5 7 7 15 5 7 1 1 9 0

lineages  The high frequency of this haplogroup is typical in all West European populations  reflecting a cline and likely continuity of the Palaeolithic gene pool in Europe  Haplogroups I and G  also characteristic markers for many different West European populations  were found in Madeira at frequencies above 5   Together with R1b  haplogroups J  12   and E1b1b  14   comprise about 80  of the Y chromosomal gene pool of Madeira individuals  Haplogroups J and E1b1b consist of lineages with differential distribution within Middle East  North Africa and Europe  The typical Berber haplogroup E1b1b1b  M81  was found as in continental Portugal at a frequency of 5 6   43  Sample A E1b1b1 E1b1b1a E1b1b1b E1b1b1c G I J  J2 T L N1c R1  R1a R1b 129 0 8 1 6 5 4 5 4 1 6 3 1 7 0 0 8 10 9 3 1 1 6 2
