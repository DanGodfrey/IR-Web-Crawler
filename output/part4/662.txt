proposed by David Boilat in 1853  is that it stems from the Wolof phrase sunu gaal  which means  our canoe   or pirogue   resulting from a miscommunication between 15th C  Portuguese sailors and Wolof fishermen  Modern historians believe its name is probably a reference to the Berber Zenaga people who lived on the northern side of the river  A competing theory is that it derives from the Medieval town of  Sanghana   also given as Isenghan  Asengan  Singhanah   described by the Arab geographer al Bakri in 1068 as located by the mouth of the river  Nonetheless  the  our canoe  theory has been popularly embraced in modern Senegal for its charm and its use in appeals to national solidarity  e g   we re all in the same canoe   are frequently heard in the media  Some Serer people from the south believe the river s name is originally derived from the compound of the Serer term  Sene   from Roge Sene  Supreme Deity in Serer religion  and  O Gal   meaning  body of water     edit  History

Century Islam became the religion of some Senegalese tribes though not in great numbers  In the 13th and 14th centuries  the area came under the influence of the empires to the east  the Jolof Empire of Senegal was also founded during this time  In the Senegambia region  between 1300 and 1900  close to one third of the population was enslaved  4  Various European powers Portugal  the Netherlands  and Great Britain competed for trade in the area from the 15th century onward  until in 1677  France ended up in possession of what had become a minor slave trade departure point the island of Gor e next to modern Dakar  used as a base to purchase slaves from the warring chiefdoms on the mainland  5  6  Slave traders in Gor e  18th century  Some kingdoms were created around the 7th century  the Tekrour  the Namandirou kingdom and then the Djolof with distant ties to the Ghana empire  In the 14th century the Djolof kingdom became a powerful empire having united Cayor  the Kingdom of Baol  the Kingdom of Sine  the Kingdom of Saloum  the Waalo  the Fouta Toro and the Bambouk kingdoms  The empire was a voluntary confederacy of various states rather than an empire built on military conquest 7  8   The empire was founded by Ndiadiane Ndiaye  a part Serer 9  10  part Toucouleur who was able to form a coalition with many ethnicities  but collapsed around 1549 with the defeat and killing of Lele Fouli Fak by Amari Ngone Sobel Fall  French colonialists progressively invaded and took over all kingdoms except Sine and Saloum under governor Louis Faidherbe  11  12  Islam was introduced in Senegal during the 8th and 9th centuries by Berber merchants citation needed   They peacefully converted the Toucouleurs and Sarakholles dubious   discuss  who in turn propagated it  Later on  in the 11th century  the Almoravids  with the help of the Toucouleurs used Jihad as a mean of conversion  This movement faced resistance from ethnicities of traditional religion  the Serers in particular 13  14   Eventually  Berbers won a peaceful conversion among the Wolofs with the intervention of leaders like Cheikh Ahmadou Bamba  El Hadj Malick Sy  and Seydina Limamou Laye who were able to convince their followers citation needed   They saw Islam as a way to unite and fight against colonial power dubious   discuss   The populations were getting weary of repeated jihads and forced colonization  Europeans missionaries introduced Christianity to Senegal and the Casamance in the 19th century  An emblematic figure of Casamance is Aline Sitoe Diatta  a woman who led the resistance movement against European colonialists 15   It was only in the 1850s that the French began to expand onto the Senegalese mainland  by now rid of slavery and promoting abolitionist doctrine   adding native chiefdoms such as Waalo  Cayor  Baol  and Jolof  Senegalese chiefs  resistance to the French expansion and curtailing of their lucrative slave trade was led in part by Lat Dior  Damel  great chief  of Cayor  In January 1959 Senegal and the French Sudan merged to form the Mali Federation  which became fully independent on 20 June 1960  as a result of the independence and the transfer of power agreement signed with France on 4 April 1960  Due to internal political difficulties  the Federation broke up on 20 August  Senegal and French Sudan  renamed the Republic of Mali  proclaimed

Africans on the Rue Lebon  In 1980  President Senghor decided to retire from politics  and he handed power over in 1981 to his handpicked successor  Abdou Diouf  Mamadou Dia ran for reelection in 1983 against Abdou Diouf but lost  Senghor moved to France where he later died at the age of 96  Senegal joined with The Gambia to form the nominal confederation of Senegambia on 1 February 1982  However  the union was dissolved in 1989  Despite peace talks  a southern separatist group in the Casamance region had clashed sporadically with government forces since 1982  Senegal has had a long history of participating in international peacekeeping  17  Abdou Diouf was president between 1981 and 2000  He encouraged broader political participation  reduced government involvement in the economy  and widened Senegal s diplomatic engagements  particularly with other developing nations  Domestic politics on occasion spilled over into street violence  border tensions  and a violent separatist movement in the southern region of the Casamance  Nevertheless  Senegal s commitment to democracy and human rights strengthened  Abdou Diouf served four terms as president  In the presidential election of 1999  opposition leader Abdoulaye Wade defeated Diouf in an election deemed free and fair by international observers  Senegal experienced its second peaceful transition of power  and its first from one political party to another  On 30 December 2004 President Abdoulaye Wade announced that he would sign a peace treaty with the separatist group in the Casamance region  This  however  has yet to be implemented  There was a round of talks in 2005  but the results did not yet yield a resolution   edit  Politics Main article  Politics of Senegal Abdoulaye Wade  current president of

however  Freedom House downgraded Senegal s status from  Free  to  Partially Free   based on increased centralisation of power in the executive  In 2008  Senegal finished in 12th position on the Ibrahim Index of African Governance 18   The Ibrahim Index is a comprehensive measure of African governance  limited to sub Saharan Africa until 2008   based on a number of different variables which reflect the success with which governments deliver essential political goods to their citizens  When the Northern African countries were added to the index in 2009  Senegal s 2008 position was retroactively downgraded to 15th place  with Tunisia  Egypt and Morocco placing themselves ahead of Senegal   where it remains today according to the latest Ibrahim Index  for 2010  18   On 22 February 2011  it was reported that Senegal has severed diplomatic ties with Iran  saying Tehran supplied rebels with weapons which killed Senegalese troops  On 26 February 2012  Senegal held presidential elections which were perceived as controversial due to President Wade s candidacy  The controversy stemmed from the fact that although the Senegalese constitution did not allow a president to serve more than two terms  President Wade amended the constitution last year which allowed him to run for a third term  Several youth opposition movements  including M23 and Y en a Marre  emerged in June 2011 to contest the amendment   edit  Geography Main article  Geography of Senegal Landscape of Casamance Senegal is located on the west of the African continent  It lies between

percent    See also the Bedick ethnic group   It should be noted that Wolof percentage above is misleading because other tribes who have been Wolofized and speak the Wolof language are added to this figure when in actual fact they are not Wolofs at all  31  About 50 000 Europeans  mostly French  and Lebanese 32  as well as smaller numbers of Mauritanians and Moroccans reside in Senegal  mainly in the cities  The majority of Lebanese work in commerce  33  Also located primarily in urban settings are small Vietnamese communities as well as a growing number of Chinese immigrant traders  each

and early 20th centuries and when they converted  they converted on their own free will rather than by force  although force had been tried centuries earlier unsuccessfully especially among the Serer people  40  During the mid 19th century  Islam became a banner of resistance against the traditional aristocracies citation needed  and French colonialism  and Tij n  leaders Al Hajj Umar Tall and M bba Jaxu Ba established short lived but influential Islamic states citation needed  but were both killed in battle and their territories clarification needed then annexed by the French  The spread of formal Quranic school  called daara in Wolof  during the colonial period increased largely through the effort of the Tijaniyya  In Murid communities  which place more emphasis on the work ethic than on literary Quranic studies  the term daara often applies to work groups devoted to working for a religious leader  Other Islamic groups include the much older Q diriyya order and the Senegalese Laayeen order  which is prominent among the coastal Lebu  Today  most Senegalese children study at daaras for several years  memorizing as much of the Qur an as they can  Some of them continue their

Koriteh  and  Weri Kor  are all borrowed words from the Serer religion  They are ancient Serer festivals  41  42  43  Like their Serers neighbours  the Jola people also have their religion and customs  One of their major religious ceremonies is the Boukout  There are small numbers of adherents of Judaism and Buddhism  Judaism is followed by members of several ethnic groups who    while Buddhism is
