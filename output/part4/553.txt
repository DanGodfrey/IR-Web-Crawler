Postage stamps and postal history of the United States From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search Postage stamp of 1895 Visualizing US expansion through post offices  1700 to 1900 This is a general historical outline of postage stamps and postal history of the United States of America  The page rarely covers the subjects or topical aspects of individual Postage stamps issues at any length  and only when it is relevant to the issuance of the postage  as some events are solely responsible for the stamp being issued  as is the case with the first Lincoln stamp of 1866  issued on the anniversary of Lincoln s death one year later  This was not a regular issue  The issue was prompted by an event  subject  and only to that extent will the stamp s subject be addressed here  The question of stamp subjects is  however  discussed in general terms  in particular  the evolving notions over the years of what images are appropriate on a stamp and under what circumstances  Some attention is thus given to the historical evolution of commemorative stamps  introduced in 1893  at first appearing only infrequently and only in multi stamp series honoring international expositions  but eventually produced in a continual stream of individual issues  Occasional notice is also taken of the manner in which commemorative and definitive stamps reflected aesthetic  cultural and ideological currents in the United States  particularly during the Roosevelt presidencies and the Cold War  Chronicled here as well is the periodic introduction of new categories of postage stamps  issued either to allow stamps to be used in a new way  the encased postage stamps of 1862  or  more often  to cover new classes of mail or new methods of delivery  Finally  when necessary  the article touches upon in the evolution of stamp production as a physical process  and the history of Government involvement in it  Contents 1 Early postal history 2 Post offices and

Early postal history Most often postal services began in the first half of the 17th century serving the first American colonies  today  the United States Postal Service is a large government organization providing a wide range of services across the U S  and its territories abroad  B Free Franklin Post Office in Philadelphia In the American colonies  informal independently run postal routes began in Boston as early as 1639  with Boston to New York City service starting in 1672  Officially sanctioned mail service began in 1692 when King William III granted to an English nobleman a delivery  patent  that included the exclusive right to establish and collect a formal postal tax on official documents of all kinds   Years later  taxation implemented through the mandatory purchase of stamps was an issue that helped to spark the American Revolution   The tax was repealed a year later  and very few were ever actually used in the thirteen colonies  but they saw service in Canada and the British Caribbean islands  1  In the years leading up to the American Revolution mail routes among the colonies existed along the few roads between Boston  New York and Philadelphia  In the middle 18th century individuals like Benjamin Franklin and William Goddard were the colonial postmasters who managed the mails then and were the general architects of a postal system that started out as an alternative to the Crown Post  the colonial mail system then  which was now becoming more distrusted as the American Revolution drew near  The postal system that Franklin and Goddard forged out of the American Revolution became the standard for the new U S  Post Office and is a system whose basic designs are still used in the United States Post Office today  2  3   edit  Post offices and postmarks Ellisville Post Office  Illinois  1891 In 1775  when Benjamin Franklin was appointed the first Postmaster General  the U S  Post Office was born  So important was the Postmaster General that in 1829 this position was included among those in the President s Cabinet  As America began to grow and new towns and villages began to appear  so too did the Post Office along with them  The dates and postmarks generated from these places often has provided the historian with a window into a given time and place in question  Each postmark is uniquely distinctive with its own name of state and town  in addition to its distinctive date  Post Offices that existed along railroad lines and at various military posts have their own special historical aspect  Mail and postmarks generated from prisoner of war camps during the Civil War  or from aboard Naval ships  each with a U S  Post Office aboard  can and have offered amazing insights into United States history and are avidly sought after by historians and collectors alike  Multiple dates in 1861 Aug  29  1893 Oct  17  1898 Dec  25  1932 Feb  19  1934  edit  Mail before postage stamps An 1832 stampless single sheet  Liverpool Ship Letter  pen franked  Paid 5  by a U S  postal clerk in Philadelphia  PA  Before the introduction of stamps  it was the recipient of mail not the sender who generally paid the cost of postage  giving the fee directly to the postman on delivery  The task of collecting money for letter after letter greatly slowed the postman on his route  Moreover the addressee would not infrequently refuse a piece of mail  which then had to be taken back to the Post Office  post office budgets always allowed for an appreciable volume of unpaid for mail   Only occasionally did a sender pay delivery costs in advance  an arrangement that usually required a personal visit to the Post Office  To be sure  postmasters allowed some citizens to run charge accounts for their delivered and prepaid mail  but bookeeping on these constituted another inefficiency  Postage stamps revolutionized this process  leading to universal prepayment  but a precondition for their issue by a nation was the establishment of standardized rates for delivery throughout the country  If postal fees were to remain  as they were in many lands  a patchwork of many different jurisdictional rates  the use of stamps would produce only limited gains in efficiency  for postal clerks would still have to spend time calculating the rates on many letters  only then would senders know how much postage to put on them   edit  Provisional issue stamps New York Postmaster s Provisional  1845 The introduction of postage stamps in the UK in May 1840 was received with great interest in the United States  and around the world   Later that year  Daniel Webster rose in the U  S  Senate to recommend that the recent English postal reforms standardized rates and the use of postage stamps be adopted in America  4  It would be private enterprise  however  that brought stamps to the U  S  On February 1  1842 a new carrier service called  City Despatch Post  began operations in New York City  introducing the first adhesive postage stamp ever produced in the western hemisphere  which it required its clients to use for all mail  This stamp was a 3  issue bearing a rather amateurish drawing of George Washington  1   printed from line engraved plates in sheets of 42 images  The company had been founded by Henry Thomas Windsor  a London merchant who at the time was living in Hoboken  New Jersey  Alexander M  Greig was advertised as the post s  agent   and as a result  historians and philatelists have tended to refer to the firm simply as  Greig s City Despatch Post   making no mention of Windsor  5  In another innovation  the company placed mail collection boxes around the city for the convenience of its customers  A few months after its founding  the City Despatch Post was sold to the U S  Government  which renamed it the  United States City Despatch Post   The government began operation of this local post on August 16  1842  under an Act of Congress of some years earlier that authorized local delivery  Greig  retained by the Post Office to run the service  kept the firm s original Washington stamp in use  but soon had its lettering altered to reflect the name change  In its revised form  this issue accordingly became the first postage stamp produced under the auspices of a government in the western hemisphere  An Act of Congress of March 3  1845  effective July 1  1845   established uniform  and mostly reduced  postal rates throughout the nation  with a uniform rate of five cents for distances under 300 miles  500 km   6  However  Congress did not authorize the production of stamps for nationwide use until 1847  still  postmasters realized that standard rates now made it feasible to produce and sell  provisional  issues for prepayment of uniform postal fees  and printed these in bulk  Such provisionals included both prepaid envelopes and stamps  mostly of crude design  the New York Postmaster s Provisional being the only one of quality comparable to later stamps  The provisional issues of Baltimore were notable for the reproduced signature of the city s postmaster James M  Buchanan  1803 1876   a cousin to President James Buchanan  All provisional issues are rare  and several command prices above US 100 000  These cities issued provisional stamps in 1845 and 1846  Provisional stamp from Providence  Rhode Island  Alexandria  Virginia   ALEXANDRIA POST OFFICE  in

rate on one significant class of mail  the so called  drop letter  i  e   a letter delivered from the same post office that collected it  Previously one cent  the drop letter rate became two cents   edit  First national postage stamps   Benjamin Franklin   George Washington   The First U S  Postage Stamps Issued 1847 The first stamp issues were authorized by an act of Congress and approved on March 3  1847  7  The earliest known use of the Franklin 5  is July 7  1847  while the earliest known use of the Washington 10  is July 2  1847  Remaining in postal circulation for only a few years  these issues were declared invalid for Postage on July 1  1851  8  Congress finally provided for the issuance of stamps by passing an act on March 3  1847  and the Postmaster General immediately let a contract to the New York City engraving firm of Rawdon  Wright  Hatch  and Edson  9  The first stamp issue of the U S  was offered for sale on July 1  1847  in New York City  with Boston receiving stamps the following day and other cities thereafter  They consisted of an engraved 5 cent red brown stamp depicting Benjamin Franklin  the first postmaster of the US   and a 10 cent value in black with George Washington  Like all U S  stamps until 1857  they were imperforate  The 5 cent stamp paid for a letter weighing less than 1 ounce and traveling less than 300 miles  the 10 cent stamp for deliveries to locations greater than 300 miles  or  twice the weight deliverable for the 5 cent stamp  Each stamp was hand engraved in what is believed to be steel  and laid out in sheets of 200 stamps  The 5 cent stamp is often found today with very poor impressions because the type of ink used contained small pieces of quartz that wore down the steel plates used to print the stamp  On the other hand  most 10 cent stamps are of strong impressions  A fresh and brilliantly printed 5 cent stamp is prized by collectors  The use of stamps was optional  letters could still be sent requiring payment of postage on delivery  Indeed  the post office issued no 2 cent value for prepaying drop letters in 1847  and these continued to be handled as they had been  Nevertheless many Americans took up using stamps  about 3 700 000 of the 5  and about 865 000 of the 10  were sold  and enough of those have survived to ensure a ready supply for collectors  although the demand is such that a very fine 5  sells for around  500 as of 2003  and the 10  in very fine condition sells for around  1 400 in used form  Unused stamps are much scarcer  fetching around  6 000 and  28 000 respectively  if in very fine condition  One can pay as little as 5 to 10 percent of these figures if the stamps are in poor condition  The post office had become so efficient by 1851 that Congress was able to reduce the common rate to three cents  which remained unchanged for over thirty years   necessitating a new issue of stamps  This rate  however  only applied to prepaid mail  a letter sent without a stamp still cost the recipient five cents clear evidence that Congress envisioned making stamp use mandatory in the future  it did so in 1855   The 1 cent drop letter rate was also restored  and Post Office plans did not at first include a stamp for it  later  however  an essay for a 6 cent Franklin double weight stamp was converted into a drop letter value  Along with this 1  stamp  the post office initially issued only two additional denominations in the series of 1851  3  and 12   the three stamps going on sale that July and August  Since the 1847 stamps no longer conformed to any postal rate  they were declared invalid after short period during which the public could exchange old stamps for new ones  Ironically  however  within a few years the Post Office found that stamps in the old denominations were needed after all  and so  added a 10  value to the series in 1855  followed by a 5  stamp the following year  The full series included a 1  profile of Franklin in blue  a 3  profile of Washington in red brown  a 5  portrait of Thomas Jefferson  and portraits of Washington for 10  green and 12  black values  The 1  stamp achieved notoriety  at least among philatelists  because production problems  the stamp design was too tall for the space provided  led to a welter of plate modifications done in piecemeal fashion  and there are no fewer than seven major varieties  ranging in price from  100 to  200 000  the latter for the only stamp of the 200 images on the first plate that displays the design s top and bottom ornamentation complete   Sharp eyed collectors periodically find the rare types going unrecognized  First national postage stamps Benjamin Franklin Issue of 1851 George Washington Issue of 1855 Thomas Jefferson Issue of 1857 George Washington Issue of 1857 George Washington Issue of 1857 1857 saw the introduction of perforation  and in 1860 24   30  and 90  values  with still more images of Washington and Franklin  were issued for the first time  In February 1861  a congressional act directed that  cards  blank or printed     shall also be deemed mailable matter  and charged with postage at the rate of one cent an ounce   Private companies soon began issuing post cards  printed with a rectangle in the top right corner where the stamp was to be affixed   The Post Office would not produce pre stamped  postal cards  for another dozen years    edit  Issues of the Civil War era Benjamin Franklin  Issue of 1861 Thomas Jefferson  Issue of 1861 The  Black Jack   1863 The outbreak of the American Civil War threw the postal system into turmoil  On April 13  1861   the day after the firing on Fort Sumter  John H  Reagan  postmaster general of the Confederate States of America  ordered local postmasters to return their US stamps to Washington DC  although it is unlikely that many did so   while in May the Union decided to withdraw and invalidate all existing US stamps  and to issue new stamps  Confederate post offices were left without legitimate stamps for several months  and while many reverted to the old system of cash payment at the post office  over 100 post offices across the South came up with their own provisional issues  Many of these are quite rare  with only single examples surviving of some types  Eventually the Confederate government issued its own stamps  see stamps and postal history of the Confederate States  In the North  the new stamp designs became available in August  and old stamps were accepted in exchange until the end of the year  The whole process was very confusing to the public  and there are number of covers from 1862 and later with 1857 stamps and bearing the marking  OLD STAMPS NOT RECOGNIZED   The 1861 stamps had in common the letters  U S  in their design  To make them differentiable from the older stamps at a glance  all were required to have their values expressed in Arabic numerals  in the previous series  Arabic numerals had appeared only on the 30  stamp   The original issue included all the denominations offered in the previous series  1   3   5   10   12   24   30  and 90  stamps  Numerals apart  several of these are superficially similar to their earlier counterparts particularly because Franklin  Washington and Jefferson still appear on the same denominations as previously  Differences in the design of the frames are more readily apparent  A 2  stamp in black featuring Andrew Jackson was issued in 1863 and is now known to collectors as the  Black Jack   A black 15  stamp depicting the recently assassinated Abraham Lincoln was issued in 1866  and is generally considered part of the same series  Although it was not officially described as such  and the 15  value was chosen to cover newly established fee for registered letters  many philatelists consider this to be the first memorial stamp ever issued  The war greatly increased the amount of mail in the North  ultimately about 1 750 000 000 copies of the 3  stamp were printed  and a great many have survived to the present day  typically selling for 2 3 dollars apiece  Most are rose colored  pink versions are much rarer and quite expensive  especially the  pigeon blood pink   which goes for  3 000 and up  The stamps of the 1861 series  unlike those of the two previous issues  remained valid for postage after they had been superseded as has every subsequent United States stamp   edit  Pony Express Pony Express compound oval Postmark  one of many types found on the covers of Pony Express mail Main article  Pony Express In 1860  the U S  Post Office incorporated the services of the Pony Express to get mail to and from San Francisco  an important undertaking with the outbreak of the Civil War  as a communication link between Union forces and San Francisco and the West Coast was badly needed  The Pony Express Trail from St  Joseph  Missouri  to Sacramento  California  was 1 840 miles long  Upon arrival in Sacramento  the U S  mail was placed on a steamer and continued down the Sacramento River to San Francisco for a total of 1 966 miles  The Pony Express was a short lived enterprise  remaining in operation for only 18 months  Consequently there is little surviving Pony Express mail today  only 250 examples known in existence   edit  Encased postage stamps Widespread hoarding of coins during the Civil War created a shortage  prompting the use of stamps for currency  To be sure  the fragility of stamps made them unsuitable for hand to hand circulation  and to solve this problem  John Gault invented the encased postage stamp in 1862  A normal U  S  stamp was wrapped around a circular cardboard disc and then placed inside a coin like circular brass jacket  A transparent mica window in the jacket allowed the face of the stamp to be seen  Denominations between 1 cent and 30 cents are known  Raised lettering on the metal backs of the jackets often advertised the goods or services of business firms  these included the Aerated Bread Company  Ayers Sarsaparilla and Cathartic Pills  Burnett s Cocoaine  Sands Ale  Drake s Plantation Bitters  Buhl  amp  Co  Hats and Furs  Lord  amp  Taylor  Tremont House  Chicago  Joseph L  Bates Fancy Goods  White the Hatter  New York City  and Ellis McAlpin  amp  Co  Dry Goods  Cincinnati  10  11   edit  Grills  G  grill on an 1869 issue Main article  Grill  philately  During the 1860s  the postal authorities became concerned about postage stamp reuse  Although there is little evidence that this occurred frequently  many post offices had never received any canceling devices  Instead  they improvised a canceling process by scribbling on the stamp with an ink pen   pen cancellation    or whittling designs in pieces of cork  sometimes very creatively   fancy cancels    to mark the stamps  However  since poor quality ink could be washed from the stamp  this method would only have been moderately successful  A number of inventors patented various ideas to attempt to solve the problem  The Post Office eventually adopted the grill  a device consisting of a pattern of tiny pyramidal bumps that would emboss the stamp  breaking up the fibers so that the ink would soak in more deeply  and thus be harder to clean off  While the patent survives  No  70 147   much of the actual process of grilling was not well documented  and there has been considerable research trying to recreate what happened and when  Study of the stamps shows that there were eleven types in use  distinguished by size and shape  philatelists have labeled them with letters A J and Z   and that the practice started some time in 1867 and was gradually abandoned after 1871  A number of grilled stamps are among the great rarities of US philately  The United States 1  Z grill was long thought to be the rarest of all US stamps  with only two known to exist  In 1961  however  it was discovered that the 15  stamp of the same series also existed in a Z grill version  this stamp is just as rare as the 1   for only two examples of the 15  Z grill are known  12  Rarer still may be the 30  stamp with the I Grill  the existence of which was discovered only recently  as of October 2011  only one copy is known  13   edit  1869 Main article  1869 Pictorial Issue SS Adriatic  1869 Horse  amp  rider  Pony Express In 1868  the Post Office contracted with the National Bank Note Company to produce new stamps with a variety of designs  These came out in 1869  and were notable for the variety of their subjects  the 2  depicted a Pony Express rider  the 3  a locomotive  the 12  the steamship Adriatic  the 15  the landing of Christopher Columbus  and the 24  the signing of the Declaration of Independence  Other innovations in what has become known as the 1869 Pictorial Issue included the first use of two color printing on U S  stamps  and as a consequence the first invert errors  Although popular with collectors today  the unconventional stamps were not very popular among a population who was accustomed to postage that bore classic portrayals of Washington  Franklin and other forefathers  Consequently the Post Office recalled all remaining stocks after one year   edit  Bank Notes Washington American Bank Note 1883 issue Oliver Hazard Perry National Bank Note 1870 issue The postage stamps issued in the 1870s and 1880s are collectively known as the  Bank Notes  because they were produced by the National Bank Note Company  the Continental Bank Note Company  then the American Bank Note Company  After the 1869 fiasco with pictorial stamp issues  the new Postmaster General decided to base a series of stamps on the  heads  in profile  of distinguished deceased Americans  using  marble busts of acknowledged excellence  as models  George Washington was returned to the normal letter rate stamp  he had played that role in the issues of 1851 and 1861 and would continue to do so in every subsequent definitive set until the Presidential Series of 1938  The various subjects on the remaining denominations included both presidents and other notables  such as Henry Clay and Oliver Hazard Perry  National first printed these  then in 1873 Continental received the contract and the plates that National used  Continental added secret marks to the plates of the lower values  distinguishing them from the previous issues  The American Bank Note Company acquired Continental in 1879  and took over the contract printing similar designs on softer papers and with some color changes  Major redesigning  however  came only in 1890  when the American Bank Note Company issued a new series in which stamp size was reduced by about 10   the so called  Small Bank Notes    In 1873  the Post Office began producing a pre stamped post card  One side was printed with a Liberty head one cent stamp design  along with the words  United States Postal Card  and three blank lines provided for the mailing address  Six years later  it introduced a series of seven Postage Due stamps in denominations ranging from 1  to 50   all printed in the same brownish red color and conforming to the same uniform and highly utilitarian design  with their denominations rendered in numerals much larger than those found on definitive stamps  The design remained unchanged until 1894  and only four different postage due designs have appeared to date  In 1883  the first class letter rate was reduced from 3  to 2   prompting a redesign of the existing 3  green Washington stamp  which now became a 2  brown issue   edit  Special Delivery First Special Delivery stamp  1885 In 1885 the Post Office established a Special Delivery service  issuing a ten cent stamp depicting a running messenger  along with the wording  secures immediate delivery at a special delivery office   Initially  only 555 such offices existed but the following year all U  S  Post Offices were obliged to provide the service an extension not  however  reflected on the Special Delivery stamp until 1888  when the words  at any post office  appeared on its reprint   On stamps of future years  the messenger would be provided the technological enhancements of a bicycle  1902  a motorcycle  1922  and a truck  1925   Although the last new U  S  Special Delivery stamp appeared issued in 1971  the service was continued until 1997  by which time it had largely been supplanted by Priority Mail delivery  introduced in 1989   The 1885 Special Delivery issue was the first U  S  postage stamp designed in the double width format  Eight years later  this shape would be chosen for the Columbian Exposition commemoratives  as it offered appropriate space for historical tableaux  The double width layout would subsequently be employed in many United States Commemoratives   edit  Columbian Issue Landing of Christopher Columbus Issue of 1893 Main article  Columbian Issue The World Columbian Exposition of 1893 commemorated the 400th anniversary of the landing of Christopher Columbus in the Americas  The Post Office got in on the act  issuing a series of 16 stamps depicting Columbus and episodes in his career  ranging in value from 1  to  5  a princely sum in those days   They are often considered the first commemorative stamps issued by any country  The stamps were interesting and attractive  designed to appeal to not only Postage stamps collectors but to historians  artists and of course the general public who bought them in record numbers because of the fanfare of the Columbian Exposition of the World s Fair of 1892 in Chicago  Illinois  They were quite successful  a great contrast to the pictorials of 1869   with lines spilling out of the nation s post offices to buy the stamps  They are prized by collectors today with the  5 denomination  for example  selling for between  1 500 to  12 500 or more  depending upon the condition of the stamp being sold  Another release in connection with the Columbian series was a reprint of the 1888 Special Delivery stamp  now colored orange  reportedly  to prevent postal clerks from confusing it with the 1  Columbian   After sales of the series ceased  the Special Delivery stamp reappeared in its original blue   edit  Bureau issues George Washington on 2 cent Bureau issue clearly showing the triangles in the upper corners Also during 1893  the Bureau of Engraving and Printing competed for the postage stamp printing contract  and won it on the first try  For the postage issues of the 1894 series  the Bureau took over the plates of the 1890 small banknote series but modified them by adding triangles to the upper corners of the designs  Three new designs were needed  because the Post Office elected to add  1   2 and  5 stamps to the series  previously  the top value of any definitive issue had been 90    On many of the 1894 stamps  perforations are of notably poor quality  but the Bureau would soon make technical improvements  In 1895 counterfeits of the 2  value were discovered  which prompted the BEP to begin printing stamps on watermarked paper for the first time in U S  postal history  The watermarks imbedded the logo U S P S into the paper in double lined letters  The Bureau s definitive issues of the 1890s consisted of 13 different denominations ranging from 1 cent to 5 dollars  and may be differentiated by the presence or absence of this watermark  which would appear on all U  S  Postage stamps between 1895 and 1910  8  The final issue of 1898 altered the colors of many denominations to bring them into conformity with the recommendations of the Universal Postal Union  an international body charged with facilitating the course of transnational mail   The aim was to ensure that in all its member nations  stamps of similar value would appear in the same color  Accordingly  U  S  1  stamps were now green and 5  stamps were now blue  while 2  and 3  stamps remained  respectively  red and purple  U  S  postage continued to reflect this color coding quite strictly until the mid 1930s   edit  Turn of the 20th century Trans Mississippi Issue  1898 1c In 1898  the Trans Mississippi Exposition opened in Omaha  Nebraska  and the Post Office was ready with the Trans Mississippi Issue  The nine stamps were originally to be two toned  with black vignettes surrounded by colored frames  but the BEP  its resources overtaxed by the needs of the Spanish American War  simplified the printing process  issuing the stamps in single colors  They were received favorably  though with less excitement than the Columbians  but like the Columbians  they are today prized by collectors  and many consider the  1  Western Cattle in Storm  14  the most attractive of all U S  stamps  Pan American Issue  1901 2c Collectors  still smarting from the expense of the Columbian stamps  objected that inclusion of  1 and  2 issues in the Trans Mississippi series presented them with an undue financial hardship  15  Accordingly  the next stamp series commemorating a prominent exposition  the Pan American Exposition held in Buffalo  New York in 1901  was considerably less costly  consisting of only five stamps ranging from in value 1  to 10   The result  paradoxically  was a substantial increase in Post Office profits  for  while the higher valued Columbians and Trans Mississippis had sold only about 20 000 copies apiece  the public bought well over five million of every Pan American denomination  16  In the Pan American series  3  the Post Office realized the plan for two toned stamps that it had been obliged to abandon during the production of the Trans Mississippi issue  Upside down placement of some sheets during the two stage printing process resulted in the so called Pan American invert errors on rare copies of the 1   2  and 4  stamps   edit  Definitive issues of 1902 1903 The definitive stamps issued by the U S  Post Office in 1902   1903 were markedly different in their overall designs from the regular definitive stamps released over the previous several decades  Among the prominent departures from tradition in these designs was that the names of the subjects were printed out  along with their years of birth and death   Printed names and birth and death dates are more typically a feature of Commemorative stamps   Unlike any definitive stamps ever issued before  the 1902 03 issues also had ornate sculptural frame work about the portrait often including allegorical figures of different sorts  with several different types of print used to denote the country  denominations and names of the subjects  This series of postage stamps were the first definitive issues to be entirely designed and printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing  and their Baroque revival style is much akin to that of the Pan American commemoratives the Bureau had issued in 1901  There are fifteen demominations ranging from 1 cent to 5 dollars  The 2 cent George Washington stamp appeared with two different designs  the original version was poorly received  while each of the other values has its own individual design  8  17  This was the first U  S  definitive series to include the image of a woman  Martha Washington  who appeared on the 8 cent stamp  Selected Issues Franklin Lincoln Harrison Marshall  edit  Commemorative issues  1904 1907 In these years  the postal service continued to produce commemorative sets in conjunction with important national expositions  The Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St  Louis  Missouri in 1904 prompted a set of five stamps  4   while a trio of stamps commemorated the Jamestown Exposition  held in Norfolk  Virginia in 1907  5    edit  The Washington Franklin era Main article  Washington Franklin Issues 1908 saw the beginning of the long running Washington Franklin series of stamps  Although there were only two central images  a profile of Washington and one of Franklin  many subtle variants appeared over the years  for the Post Office experimented with half a dozen different perforation sizes  two kinds of watermarking  three printing methods  and large numbers of values  all adding to several hundred distinct types identified by collectors  Some are quite rare  but many are extremely common  this was the era of the postcard craze  and almost every antique shop in the U S  will have some postcards with green 1  or red 2  stamps from this series  In 1910 the Post Office began phasing out the double lined watermark  replacing it by the same U S P S logo in smaller single line letters  Watermarks were discontinued entirely in 1916  Washington Franklin Issues Washington  issue of 1912 Washington  issue of 1917 Franklin  The Big Bens   issue of 1918 Toward the beginning of the Washington Franklin era  in 1909  the Post Office issued its first individual commemorative stamps three single 2  issues honoring  respectively  the Lincoln Centennial  the Alaska Yukon Exposition  and the Hudson Fulton anniversaries  6   A four stamp series commemorating the Panama Pacific Exposition in San Francisco  California appeared in 1913  7   but no further commemoratives were issued until after World War I  20  Parcel Post Stamp   Aeroplane Carrying Mail  This was the first image of an airplane on a U  S  stamp  It was also in 1913  in January  that the Post Office introduced domestic parcel post service  a belated development  given that international parcel post service between the United States and other countries began in 1887   A series of twelve Parcel Post stamps intended for this service had already been released in December 1912  ranging in denomination from 1  to  1  All were printed in red and designed in the wide Columbian format  The eight lowest values illustrated aspects of mail handling and delivery  while higher denominations depicted such industries as Manufacturing  Dairying and Fruit Growing  Five green Parcel Post Postage Due stamps appeared concurrently  It soon became obvious that none of these stamps was needed  parcel postage could easily be paid by definitive or commemorative issues  and normal postage due stamps were sufficient for parcels  When original stocks ran out  no reprints appeared  nor were replacements for either group ever contemplated  On November 3  1917  the normal letter rate was raised from 2  to 3  in support of the war effort  The rate hike was reflected in the first postwar commemorative a 3   victory  stamp released on March 3  1919  not until July 1 would postal fees return to peacetime levels    edit  The 1920s and 1930s 1923 Freedom   5  blue and red The stamps of the 1920s were dominated by the Series of 1922  the first new design of definitive stamps to appear in a generation  The lower values mostly depicted various Presidents  with the 5c particularly intended as a memorial of the recently deceased Theodore Roosevelt  while the higher values included an  American Indian   Hollow Horn Bear   the Statue of Liberty  Golden Gate  without the bridge  which had yet to be built   Niagara Falls  a bison  the Lincoln Memorial and so forth  Higher values of the series  from 17  through  5  were differentiated from the cheaper stamps by being designed in horizontal  landscape  rather than vertical format  an idea carried over from the  big Bens  of the Washington Franklin series  Regular Issues 1922 1925 Stamp printing was switching from a flat plate press to a rotary press while these stamps were in use  and most come in two perforations as a result  11 for flat plate  and 11x10 5 for rotary  In 1929  theft problems in the Midwest led to the Kansas Nebraska overprints on the regular stamps   See also  Fourth Bureau issue   From 1924 on  commemorative stamps appeared every year  The 1920s saw a number of 150th anniversaries connected with the American Revolutionary War  and a number of stamps were issued in connection with those  These included the first US souvenir sheet  for the Battle of White Plains sesquicentennial  and the first overprint  reading  MOLLY   PITCHER   the heroine of the Battle of Monmouth   edit  Two Cent Red Sesquicentennial issues of 1926 1932 During this period the US Post Office issued more than a dozen  Two Cent Reds  commemorating the 150th anniversaries of Battles and Events that occurred during the American Revolution  The first among these was the Liberty Bell 150th Anniversary Issue of 1926  designed by Clair Aubrey Huston  and engraved by J Eissler  amp  E M Hall  two among America s most renowned master engravers  The  Two Cent Reds  were among the last stamps used to carry a letter for 2 cents  the rate changing to 3 cents on July 6  1932  There the rate remained for 26 years until it finally changed to 4 cents in 1958    Two Cent Red Sesquicentennial issues of 1926 1932  edit  Graf Zeppelin stamps 65 cent  Zeppelin  of 1930  issued in April for the May June Pan American flight of the Graf Zeppelin The German zeppelins were of much interest during this period  and in 1930 the Department issued special stamps to be used on the Pan American flight of Graf Zeppelin  Although the Graf Zeppelin stamps are today highly prized by collectors as masterpieces of the engraver s art  in 1930 the recent stock market crash meant that few were able to afford these stamps  the  4 55 value for the set represented a week s food allowance for a family of four   Less than 10 percent of the 1 000 000 of each denomination issued were sold and the remainders were incinerated  the stamps were only available for sale to the public from April 19  1930  to June 30  1930   It is estimated that less than 8 percent of the stamps produced survive today and they remain the smallest U S  issue of the 20th century  only 229 260 of these stamps were ever purchased  and only 61 296 of the  2 60 stamp were sold   In 1932  a set of 12 stamps was issued to celebrate the George Washington s 200th birthday 1932 Washington Bicentennial  For the 2  value  which satisfied the normal letter rate  the most familiar Gilbert Stuart image of Washington had been chosen  After postal rates rose that July  this 2  red Washington was redesigned as a 3  stamp and issued in the purple color that now became ubiquitous among U  S  commemoratives   edit  The New Deal Era In 1933  Franklin D  Roosevelt became President  He was notable not only as an avid collector in his own right  with a collection estimated at around 1 million stamps   but also for taking an interest in the stamp issues of the Department  working closely with Postmaster James Farley  the former Democratic Party Committee Chairman  Many designs of the 1930s were inspired or altered according to Roosevelt s advice  In 2009 10  the US National Postal Museum exhibited six Roosevelt sketches that were developed into stamp issues  the 6 cent eagle airmail stamp and five miscellaneous commemoratives  which honored the Byrd Antarctic Expedition  the Mothers of America  Susan B  Anthony  Virginia Dare and the Northwest Territories  rise to statehood  A steady stream of commemoratives appeared during these years  including a striking 1934 issue of ten stamps presenting iconic vistas of ten National Parks a set that has remained widely beloved   In a memorable sequence from Philip Roth s novel The Plot Against America  the young protagonist dreams that his National Parks stamps  the pride and joy of his collection  have become disfigured with swastika overprints   Choosing an orange color for the 2  Grand Canyon tableau instead of the standard 2  carmine red  the Post Office departed from U  P  U  color coding for the first time  National Parks Issue 1936 Souvenir sheet reproducing four recent three cent commemoratives With a philatelist in the White House  the Post Office catered to collectors as never before  issuing seven separate souvenir sheets between 1933 and 1937  In one case  a collectors  series had to be produced as the result of a miscalculation  Around 1935  Postmaster Farley removed sheets of the National Parks set from stock before they had been gummed or perforated  giving these and unfinished examples of ten other issues to President Roosevelt and Interior Secretary Harold Ickes  also a philatelist  as curiosities for their collections  When word of these gifts got out  public outcries arose  Some accused Farley of a corrupt scheme to enrich Roosevelt and Ickes by creating valuable rarities for them at taxpayer expense  Stamp aficionados  in turn  demanded that these curiosities be sold to the public so that ordinary collectors could acquire them  and Farley duly issued them in bulk  This series of special printings soon became known as  Farley s Follies   As the decade progressed  the purples used for 3  issues  although still ostensibly conforming to the U  P  U  code  displayed an increasingly wide variety of hues  and one 1940 issue  a 3  stamp commemorating the Pony Express  dispensed with purple entirely  appearing in a rust brown earth tone more suitable to the image of a horse and rider departing from a western rural post office   edit  Presidential Issue of 1938   Presidential issue of 1938   Main article  Presidential Issue The famous Presidential Issue  known as  Prexies  for short  came out in 1938  The series featured all 29 U S  presidents through Calvin Coolidge  each of whom appeared in profile as a small sculptural bust  Values of 50  and lower were mono colored  on the  1   2  and  5 stamps the presidents  images were printed in black on white  surrounded by colored lettering and ornamentation  Up through the 22  Cleveland stamp  the denomination assigned to each president corresponds to his position in the presidential roster  thus the first president  Washington  is on the 1  value  the seventeenth  Andrew Johnson  is on the 17  value  etc  Additional stamps depict Franklin       Martha Washington  1     and the White House  4     Many of the values were included merely to place the presidents in proper numerical order and did not necessarily correspond to a postal rate  and one of the  difficult  games for Prexie collectors is to find a cover with  for instance  a single 16  stamp that pays a combination of rate and fees valid during the Prexies  period of usage  Many such covers remain to be discovered  some sellers on eBay have been surprised to discover an ordinary seeming cover bid up to several hundred dollars because it was one of the sought after solo usages  The Presidential issue remained in distribution for many years  Not until 1954 did the Post Office begin replacing its values with the stamps of a new definitive issue  the Liberty series   edit  Famous Americans Series of 1940 In 1940  the US Post Office issued a set of 35 stamps  issued over the course of approximately ten months  commemorating America s famous Authors  Poets  Educators  Scientists  Composers  Artists and Inventors  The Educators included Booker T  Washington  who now became the first African American to be honored on a U  S  Stamp  This series of Postage issues was printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing  These stamps were larger in size than normal definitive issues  with only 280 stamp images contained on the printing plate  400 images was standard for the Presidential series   Notable also is the red violet color chosen for the 3  stamps  a brighter hue than the traditional U  P  U  purple    Famous Americans Series of 1940    Resolution  4 401   5 985  Authors  Washington

During the war  production of new U  S  3 cent commemoratives all but ground to a halt  Among the three issues that appeared in 1942 was the celebrated Win the War stamp  which enjoyed enormously wide use  owing partly to patriotism and partly to the relative unavailability of alternatives  It presents an eagle posed in a  V  shape for victory surrounded by 13 stars  The eagle is grasping arrows  but has no olive branch  A notable commemorative set did  indeed  appear in 1943 44  but its stamps  all valued at 5 cents  were not competitive with the Win the War issue  This was the Overrun Countries series  known to collectors as the Flag set   produced as a tribute to the thirteen nations that had been occupied by the Axis Powers  18  The thirteen stamps present full color images of the national flags of Poland  Czechoslovakia  Norway  Luxembourg  the Netherlands  Belgium  France  Greece  Yugoslavia  Albania  Austria  Denmark  and Korea  with the names of the respective countries written beneath  To the left of each flag appears the image of the phoenix  which symbolizes the renewal of life  and to its right appears a kneeling female figure with arms raised  breaking the shackles of servitude  19  The stamps with flags of European countries were released at intervals from June to December 1943  while the Korea flag stamp was released in November 1944  20  Because of the elaborate process necessary for the full color printing  the Bureau of Engraving and Printing contracted with a private firm  the American Bank Note Company  to produce the series the first U  S  stamps to be printed by a private company since 1893  Uniquely among U  S  issues  the sheets lack the plate numbers usually printed on the selvage surrounding the stamps  In the places where the numbers normally appear on each sheet  the name of the country is substituted  engraved in capital letters  Overrun Countries stamps  edit  Post World War II The post World War II stamp program followed a consistent pattern for many years  a steady stream of commemorative issues sold as single stamps at the first class letter rate  While the majority of these were designed in the double width format  an appreciable number issued in honor of individuals conformed instead to the format  size  general design style and red violet hue used in the 1940 Famous Americans series  George W  Carver 1948 Indeed  as has been noted  the Postal Service had become increasingly lax about employing the purple recommended by the Universal Postal Union for 3  stamps  and after the war  departures from the color code in double width commemoratives veritably became the rule rather than the exception  although U  P  U  colors would continue to be used in the definitive issues of the next decades   Beginning in 1948  Congressional Representatives and Senators began to push the Post Office for stamps proposed by constituents  leading to a relative flood of stamps honoring obscure persons and organizations  Stamp issue did not again become well regulated until the formation of the Citizens  Stamp Advisory Committee  CSAC  in 1957  The Liberty issue of 1954  deep in the Cold War  took a much more political slant than previous issues  The common first class stamp was a 3  Statue of Liberty in purple  and included the inscription  In God We Trust   the first explicit religious reference on a U S  stamp  ten days before the issue of the 3  Liberty stamp  the words  under God  had been inserted into the Pledge of Allegiance   The Statue of Liberty appeared on two additional higher values as well  8  and 11   both of which were printed in two colors  The other stamps in the series included liberty related statesmen and landmarks  such as Patrick Henry and Bunker Hill  although other subjects   Benjamin Harrison  for example  seem unrelated to the basic theme  In 1957  the American Flag was featured on a U  S  stamp for the first time  The Post Office had long avoided this image  fearing accusations that  in issuing stamps on which they would be defacing the flag by cancellation marks  they would be both committing and fomenting desecration  However  protests against this initial flag issue were muted  and the flag has remained a perennially popular U  S  stamp subject ever since  The 3  rate for first class had been unchanged since 1932  but by 1958 there were no more efficiency gains to keep the lid on prices  and the rate went to 4   beginning a steady series of rate increases that reached 44  as of May 11  2009  The Prominent Americans series superseded the  Liberties  in the 1960s and proved the last definitive issue to conform to the Universal Postal Union color code  In the 1970s  they were replaced by the Americana series  in which colors became purely a matter of designer preference  In 1971  the Post Office was reorganized  becoming the United States Postal Service  USPS   However  it is still heavily regulated  with  for instance  the CSAC continuing to decide which commemorative stamps to issue   edit  Air Mail 1918 6c was the same design as the notable 24 cent Inverted Jenny variety of this series Main articles  Airmails of the United States and List of United States airmail stamps Airmail in the United States Post Office emerged in three stages beginning with the  pioneer period  21  where there were many unofficial flights carrying the mail prior to 1918  the year the US Post Office assumed delivery of all Air Mail  The US Post office began contracting out to the private sector to carry the mail  Contract Air Mail  CAM  on February 15  1926  In 1934  all US Air Mail was carried by the U S  Army for six months  after which the contract system resumed   edit  Abraham Lincoln postage issues On April 14  1866  one year to the day after Abraham Lincoln s assassination  the U S  Post Office issued its first postage stamp honoring the fallen President  It is considered by some as America s first commemorative stamp  From that point on Lincoln s portrayal appeared on a variety of US postage stamps and today exists on more than a dozen issues  Lincoln is also honored on commemorative stamps issued by Costa Rica and Nicaragua  With the exceptions of George Washington and Benjamin Franklin  Lincoln appears on US Postage more than any other famous American  8  Lincoln Issues The 1st Lincoln postage stamp issue of 1866 Issue of 1890 Issue of 1903 Issue of 1938  edit  Modern U S  stamps 5  George Washington  1962 The first self adhesive stamp was a 10 cent stamp from the Christmas issue of 1974  It was not considered successful  and the surviving stamps  though not rare  are all gradually becoming discolored due to the adhesive used  Self adhesives were not issued again until 1989  gradually becoming so popular that as of 2004 update   only a handful of types are offered with the traditional gum  now affectionately called  manual stamps  by postal employees   The increasing frequency of postal rate increases from the 1970s on  and the necessity to wait for these to be approved by Congress  made it problematic for the Postal Service to provide stamps matching the increased costs in a timely manner  Until it was known  for example  whether the new first class rate would be 16c or  instead  15c  no denominated stamp could be printed  The Postal Service found a way to bypass this problem in 1978  Preparatory to that year s increase  an orange colored stamp with a simple eagle design appeared bearing the denomination  A  instead of a number  and the public was informed that this stamp would satisfy the new first class rate  whatever it turned out to be  Subsequent rate increases resulted in B  C and D stamps  which bore the same eagle design but were printed  respectively  in purple  buff brown and blue green  When it came time for an E stamp in 1987  the Postal Service commissioned a more elaborate design  a color picture of the globe as seen from space  E for Earth   Rises since have prompted F for Flower  G for Old Glory and H for Hat stamps  all appropriately illustrated  The F stamp in 1991 was accompanied by an undenominated  make up  stamp with no pictorial design beyond a frame  which enclosed the words  This U  S  stamp  along with 25c of additional U  S  postage  is equivalent to the  F  stamp rate   The Great Americans series and the Transportation coils began appearing in 1980 and 1981  respectively  The transportation coils were used steadily for some 20 years  while Great Americans still appear regularly as of 2004 update   The increasing use of email and other technologies during the 1990s led to a decline in the amount of first class mail  while bulk mail increased  A large variety of commemorative stamps continue to appear  but more and more of them just go to collectors  while the stamps of the average person s daily mail are non denominated types issued specifically for businesses  In 2005  after 111 years of producing American postage stamps  the Bureau of Engraving and Printing ended its involvement with the postal service  On April 12  2007  the Forever stamp went on sale for 41 cents  and is good for mailing one ounce First Class letters anytime in the future regardless of price changes  The postage on such letters is currently 45 cents  as of January 22  2012   In 2011  the Post Office began issuing all new stamps for First Class postage both definitives and commemoratives as Forever stamps  denominations were no longer included on them  On February 25  2010  the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled 2 1 that Frank Gaylord  sculptor of the Korean War Veterans Memorial  was entitled to compensation when an image of that sculpture was used on a 37 cent postage stamp because he had not signed away his intellectual property rights to the sculpture when it was erected  The appeals court rejected arguments that the photo was transformative  22  In 2006 sculptor Frank Gaylord enlisted Fish  amp  Richardson to make a pro bono claim that the Postal Service had violated his Intellectual property rights to the sculpture and thus should have been compensated  The Postal Service argued that Gaylord was not the sole sculptor  saying he had received advice from federal sources who recommended that the uniforms appear more in the wind  and also that the sculpture was actually architecture  Gaylord won all of his arguments in the lower court except for one  the court ruled the photo was fair use and thus he was not entitled to compensation  Gaylord appealed and won the case on appeal  The case can now either be appealed to the United States Supreme Court or damages can be assessed by the lower court  22  Later in the year  automated stamp and bank automatic teller machines began dispensing thinner stamps  The thin stamps were to make it easier for automated stamp machines to dispense and to make the stamps more environmentally friendly From WRGB  edit  New stamps Twelve criteria for new stamps and postal stationery 23  include that  events of historical significance shall be considered for commemoration only on anniversaries in multiples of 50 years   For many years  these included the restriction that  no postal item will be issued sooner than five years after the individual s death   with an exception provided for stamps memorializing recently deceased U S  Presidents  In September 2011  however  the postal service announced that  in an attempt to increase flagging revenues  stamps would soon offer images of celebrated living persons  chosen by the Committee in response to suggestions submitted by the public via surface mail and social networks on the internet  The revised criterion reads   The Postal Service will honor living men and women who have made extraordinary contributions to American society and culture   23  On June 14  2008  in Washington  DC  the Postal Service  issued the first set of 10 designs in the 42 cent Flags of Our Nation stamps  The stamps were designed by Howard E  Paine of Delaplane  Virginia  Two sets of ten stamps will be issued each year through 2010 for a total of sixty stamp designs  Currently the Flags of Our Nation stamps program has been issued five sets  24  25   edit  Timeline First class postage rate history 1639  First American Post Office set
