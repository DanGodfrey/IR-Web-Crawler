residence  or permanent residents of Canada  Canada has two official languages and cultures  English and French  which have developed two distinct comics cultures  The English follows mostly American trends  and the French follows mostly Franco Belgian trends  1  with little crossover between the two cultures  Canadian comics run the gamut of comics forms  including editorial cartooning  comic strips  comic books  graphic novels and webcomics  and are published in newspapers  magazines  online  and in books  They have received much critical acclaim in the international arts comics community  2  and have received support from the federal and provincial governments  including grants from the Canada Council for the Arts  There are a number of comics publishers throughout the country  as well as large small press  self publishing and minicomics communities  In English Canada  many cartoonists  from Hal Foster to Todd MacFarlane  have sought to further their careers by moving to the US  while since the end of the 20th century  increasing numbers have managed to gain international attention while staying in Canada  During World War II  trade restrictions led to the flourishing of a local comic book industry  whose black and white  Canadian Whites  contained original stories of heroes like Nelvana of the Northern Lights  as well as American scripts redrawn by local artists  The War s end saw American imports and domestic censorship lead to the death of the industry  The Alternative and small press communities began to grow in the 1970s  and by the end of the century Dave Sim s Cerebus and Chester Brown s comics  amongst others  had gained international audiences and critical acclaim  and Drawn and Quarterly became a leader in arts comics publishing  In the 21st century  comics  especially in the form of graphic novels or webcomics  have gained wider audiences and higher levels of recognition  In French Canada  local comics are called BDQ or bande dessin e qu b coise  French pronunciation   b  d d  si ne ke be kwaz   Cartoons with speech balloons in Qu bec date back at least as far as the late 1700s  BDQ have alternately flourished and languished throughout Qu bec s history  as it is hard for such a small market to compete with foreign imports  Many cartoonists from Qu bec have made their careers south of the border  Since the  Springtime of BDQ  in the 1970s  local comics magazines  like Croc and Safarir  and comics albums have become more common  although only making up 5  of total sales in the province  Since the turn of the 21st century  cartoonists such as Michel Rabagliati and the team of Dubuc and Delaf have seen international success in French speaking Europe  as well as translations into other languages   ditions Mille  les and La Past que are amongst the local publishers that have become increasingly common  Contents 1 History 1 1 English 1 1 1 Early history  1759 1910s  1 1 2 Age of comic strips  1920s 1930s  1 1 3 Golden age

John A  Macdonald was a favourite target of John Bengough s popular caricatures  edit  Early history  1759 1910s  Brigadier General George Townshend s cartoons lampooning General James Wolfe in 1759 are celebrated as the first examples of political cartooning in Canada s history  3  Cartoons did not have a regular forum in Canada  however  until John Henry Walker s short lived weekly Punch in Canada  the Canadian version of Britain s humorous Punch  debuted in Montr al in 1849  4  3  featuring cartoons by Walker  It paved the way for a number of similar short lived publications  until the success of the more straight laced Canadian Illustrated News  which started in 1869  soon after Confederation  5  and was published by George  douard Desbarats  6  Palmer Cox had an international hit with The Brownies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries In 1873  John Bengough founded Grip  a humorous magazine in the style of Punch and the American Harper s Weekly  It featured a large number of cartoons  especially Bengough s own  The cartoons tended to be political  with Prime Minister John A  Macdonald and M tis rebel leader Louis Riel as favourite targets  7  8  The Pacific Scandal gave Bengough much fodder to raise his reputation as a political caricaturist  While Bengough was probably the most significant pre 20th Century Canadian cartoonist  Henri Julien was likely the most accomplished  Published widely both at home and abroad  Julien s cartoons appeared in periodicals such as Harper s Weekly and Le Monde illustr   5  In 1888  he was picked up by the Montreal Star and became the first cartoonist in Canada to be hired full time by a newspaper  8  Ex patriot Palmer Cox at this time created The Brownies  a popular widely merchandised phenomenon whose first book collection sold over a million copies  5  Cox began a Brownies comic strip in 1898 one of the earliest English language strips and by the time it came to an end in 1907  it had also begun to use speech balloons  9   edit  Age of comic strips  1920s 1930s  Jimmy Frise s Birdseye Center  later Juniper Junction  was the longest running strip in English Canada Canadian cartoonists often found it hard to make it in the field of comic strips without moving stateside  but in 1921  Jimmy Frise  one of Ernest Hemingway s drinking buddies during the journalist s days in Toronto  sold Life s Little Comedies to the Toronto Star s Star Weekly  This strip was later retitled Birdseye Center  and became the longest running strip in English Canadian history  In 1947  Frise brought his strip to the Montreal Standard  where it was renamed Juniper Junction  10 Nova Scotia born artist J  R  Williams saw his single panel strip about rural and small town life  Out Our Way  syndicated in 700 newspapers at its peak  11  Two new comic strips appeared on the same day in 1929 in American newspapers to feed the public s desire for escapist entertainment at the dawn of the Great Depression  They were the first non humorous adventure strips  and both were adaptations  One was Buck Rogers  the other  Tarzan  by Halifax  Nova Scotia native Hal Foster  who had worked as illustrator for catalogues from Eaton s and the Hudson s Bay Company before moving to the States in his late 20s  These strips were soon followed by other adventures strips  and paved the way for the genre diversity that was seen in comic strips in the 1930s  In 1937  Foster began his own strip  Prince Valiant  which has become his best known work  famed for Foster s realistic artistic dexterity  12  The Toronto Telegram began to run Men of the Mounted in 1933  12  the first home grown adventure strip  written by Ted McCall and drawn by Harry Hall  McCall would later pen Robin Hood and Company as well  which would eventually make its appearance in comic books when McCall founded Anglo American Publishing in 1941  13   edit  Golden age  Canadian Whites  1940s  Main article  Canadian Whites The Golden Age of Comic Books and subsequent superhero boom kicked off with the June 1938 release of Action Comics  1  The cover story was the first appearance of Superman  drawn by Toronto born Joe Shuster  14  Shuster modeled Superman s Metropolis after his memories of Toronto  and the newspaper Clark Kent worked for after the Toronto Daily Star  which he had delivered as a child  15  These comics crossed the border  quickly gaining Canadian fans as well  16  In December 1940  the War Exchange Conservation Act was passed  It restricted the importation of goods from the US that were deemed non essential  in order to combat the trade deficit the country had with their neighbours to the south  17  18  16  American comic books were one of the casualties of the Act  17  In 1941  to fill the void  a number of Canadian comic book publishers sprang up  starting in March with Anglo American Publishing in Toronto and Maple Leaf Publishing in Vancouver  They were soon joined by Adrian Dingle s Hillborough Studios and Bell Features  The comics printed by these companies had colour covers  but the innards were in black and white  giving rise amongst collectors to calling them Canadian Whites  Superheroes were prominent among them  and the  Whites  often relied on serials to keep kids coming back for more  19  Better Comics from Maple Leaf and Robin Hood and Company from Anglo American were the first titles to hit the stands  Robin Hood was a tabloid sized comic strip reprint magazine  while Better was made up of original material in traditional comic book format  and thus can be said to be the first true Canadian comic book  It included the appearance of the first Canadian superhero  Vernon Miller s Iron Man  The talented John Stables  going by the pen name John St  Ables  was responsible for Brok Windsor s debut in Better in the spring of 1944 a fantasy adventure set far in the  land beyond the mists  in the Canadian North  The success of Better led to a proliferation of titles from Maple Leaf  19  Adrian Dingle s Nelvana of the Northern Lights  Canada s first female superhero The driving creative forces behind Anglo American were Ted McCall  the writer of the Men of the Mounted and Robin Hood strips  and artist Ed Furness  The pair created a number of heroes with names like Freelance  Purple Rider  Red Rover and Commander Steel  Anglo American also published a number of stories based on imported American scripts bought from Fawcett Publications  with fresh artwork by Canadians in order to bypass the trade restrictions  Captain Marvel and Bulletman were among the characters that had Canadian adaptations  Anglo American published a large number of titles  including Freelance  Grand Slam  Three Aces  Whiz  Captain Marvel and Atom Smasher  but relied less on serials  and was less patriotically Canadian than its rival publishers  It employed a number of talented artists  but they were kept to a  house style  of drawing  in the vein of Captain Marvel s C  C  Beck  20  In August 1941  three unemployed artists  Adrian Dingle and Andr  and Ren  Kulbach  formed Hillborough Studios to publish their comics  starting with Triumph Adventure Comics  The star of Triumph Adventure was Canada s first female superhero  Nelvana of the Northern Lights  21  who appeared several months before Wonder Woman came along  22  Nelvana was inspired by tribal stories brought back from the Arctic Group of Seven painter Franz Johnston  23  The popular fur miniskirted superheroine was a powerful Inuit mythological figure  daughter of a mortal woman and Koliak the Mighty  King of the Northern Lights  She was able to ride the Northern Lights at the speed of light  turn invisible  melt metal  and had telepathic powers  24  In March 1942  Dingle and most of the Hillborough staff moved  along with Nelvana  to Toronto based Bell Features  which had begun publishing comics in September 1941 with the first issue of the hugely successful Wow Comics in colour at first  but Bell soon switched to the familiar  White  format  22  Bell was the most prolific of the Canadian comics publishers  25  Their comics were drawn by a large pool of artists  including freelancers  adolescents  and women  and were unabashedly Canadian  Aside from Nelvana  there were Edmund Legault s Dixon of the Mounted  Jerry Lazare s Phantom Rider  and Fred Kelly s Doc Stearne  Leo Bachle s Johnny Canuck was the second Canadian national hero  and debuted in Bell s Dime Comics in February 1942  22  The new Canadian comics were successful  with Bell reaching weekly sales of 100 000 by 1943  By this time  Educational Projects of Montr al had joined in  selling comics in the  White  format  Educational specialized in a different sort of fare  biographies of prime ministers  cases of the RCMP  and historical tales  drawn by accomplished artists like George M  Rae and Sid Barron  Educational s Canadian Heroes earned endorsements from cabinet ministers and appealed to parents and educators  but was not so appealing to the kids it was aimed at until Rae convinced publisher Harry J  Halperin to allow him to include a fictional character  Canada Jack a more realistic hero who battled Nazis  25  With the end of World War II in 1945  Canadian comic book publishing was faced with competition from American publishers once again  Educational and late comer Feature Publications folded immediately  Maple Leaf tired to compete by switching to colour  and by trying to break into the British market  Anglo American and another newcomer  Al Rucker Publications  tried to compete directly with the Americans  even achieving distribution in the States  26  By the end of 1946  however  it was clear that the remaining publishers could not compete  and for the time being  original comic book publishing came to an end in Canada  although some publishers would survive by republishing American books  until the War Exchange Conservation Act was officially abolished in 1951  27  The cartoonists who insisted on drawing for a living faced several choices  some moved across the border to attempt to make it with the American publishers  and some moved into illustration work  as Jerry Lazare  Vernon Miller  Jack Tremblay and Harold Bennett did  Another avenue was political cartooning  which was the route Sid Barron followed  28  By 1949  out of 176 comics titles on the newsstand  only 23 were Canadian  29   edit  Post war  late 1940s early 1970s  With the end of most original Canadian comic book publishing in 1947  Canada s superheroes disappeared  and the country entered a phase of foreign comic book domination  In the late 1940s  a crime comics scare hit the country when a pair of voracious comic book readers in Dawson Creek  British Columbia  shot at a random car while playing highwaymen  fatally wounding a passenger  When authorities discovered their taste for comic books  media attention focused on the emerging crime comics genre as an influence on juvenile delinquency  A bill to amend Section 207 of the Criminal Code was drafted  and passed unanimously  making it an offence to make  print  publish  distribute  sell  or own  any magazine  periodical or book which exclusively or substantially comprises matter depicting pictorially the commission of crimes  real or fictitious   30  31  on 10 December 1949  Comics publishers across Canada banded together to create the Comic Magazine Industry Association of Canada  CMIAC   a Canadian industry self censoring body similar to the American Comics Code Authority that would be formed a few years later in response to a similar crime comics scare in the U S  30  Superior Publishers  however  defied the ban  while also moving into the U S  market  Watchdogs turned up the heat  and in 1953 a distributor was found guilty of distributing obscenities  Some of Superior s titles found themselves in Fredric Wertham s notorious and influential diatribe on the influence comics had on juvenile delinquency  Seduction of the Innocent  published in 1954  The United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency  established in 1953  had public hearings a few months later  and called upon Kamloops  BC Member of Parliament E  Davie Fulton  one of Superior publisher William Zimmerman s most outspoken enemies  as a witness  The Comics Code Authority was soon formed  and Superior  like fellow American publisher EC Comics  saw their sales dwindle throughout 1955  Prosecutions increased throughout Canada  with Superior successfully defending themselves in one  and another supposedly comics related murder was reported in Westville  Nova Scotia  Superior shut its doors in 1956  and until the 1970s  English Canadian newsstand comic book publishing was no more  although a number of  giveaway  comics continued to be produced by Orville Ganes  Ganes Productions and Owen McCarron s Comic Book World  who produced the educational and cautionary comics for governments and corporations  aimed at kids and teens  30  Doug Wright s Nipper was a mainstay in Canadian newspapers in the post war years The crackdown was not aimed at comic strips  however  and several notable new ones appeared  like Lew Saw s One Up  Winslow Mortimer s Larry Brannon and Al Beaton s Ookpik  30  After Jimmy Frise s death in 1948  Juniper Junction was taken over by Doug Wright   one of Canada s best post war comic strip artists   10  He would continue with the strip until 1968  while also working on his own Nipper from 1949  In 1967  Nipper became Doug Wright s Family when Wright moved from Montr al to Ontario  and the popular strip continued until 1980  32  The Doug Wright Awards were inaugurated in his honour in 2005  Early editorial cartooning lacked a local flavour  tending to be a pale imitation of American examples  It tended to be cheery  non confrontational  and supported good causes  Following the War it broke from typical American clich s and took on more of a savage bite  especially compared to the more allegorical tendencies of American editorial cartoons  At Le Devoir  Robert Lapalme was the first to cartoon in this particularly Canadian idiom  and in 1963 organized an International Salon of Caricature and Cartoon in Montr al  Lapalme was later followed by Duncan Macpherson at the Toronto Star  Leonard Norris at the Vancouver Sun and Ed McNally at the Montreal Star  These cartoonists frequently took political positions contrary to those of the papers in which they were published  3  8  Macpherson drew a cartoon of John Diefenbaker as Marie Antoinette saying  Let them eat cake  in response to the Prime Minister s cancelling the Avro Arrow project  which historian Pierre Burton has called the beginning of Canadians  disillusionment with Diefenbaker s government  33  Macpherson in particular fought fiercely for editorial independence  challenging his editors and threatening to quit the Star if not given his way  which paved a new path for other cartoonists to follow  3  In 1967  Canada saw its first comic shop open its doors  Memory Lane in Toronto  established by George Henderson  inspired pioneering retailer Harry Kremer and Bill Johnson to open Now  amp  Then Books in Kitchener  Ontario  Its newsletter  the Now and Then Times  published early work by the young Dave Sim in its inaugural issue in 1972  and later employed him from 1976 to 1977  34  In the late 1960s  along with the countercultural movement  a new form of comic art appeared from the avant garde and literary scenes underground comics  or  comix   aimed at an adult audience  Early examples appeared in certain magazines  but an early precursor of Canadian underground comic books was Scraptures  as a special issue of the Toronto avant garde literary magazine grOnk in 1967  In 1969  Canada saw its first true underground comics  with SFU Komix and Snore Comix  These comix drew their inspiration from the American underground movement that exploded after the release of Robert Crumb s Zap in early 1968  Martin Vaugh James produced an early graphic novel when he had Elephant released by Press Porc pic in 1970  The underground movement paralleled that of the US  in that it peaked from 1970 to 1972 with the peak of the counterculture  and witnessed a sharp decline afterward  Saskatoon  Saskatchewan s Dave Geary and Vancouver  BC s Rand Holmes were key figures  Holmes being the creator of the Harold Hedd comic strip  35  Humour magazine Fuddle Duddle  named after a famous euphemism by then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau  was a short lived attempt at a Canadian Mad style satirical magazine  It was the first comic book of Canadian content to be available on newsstands since 1956  Two of its contributors  Peter Evans and Stanley Berneche  would soon go on to bring superheroes back to Canada for the first time since the demise of Nelvana in 1947  with Captain Canuck  35  The fan press and fandom grew throughout this period  and was bolstered when Patrick Loubert and Michael Hirsh  the founders of the animation company Nelvana  published of The Great Canadian Comic Books in 1971  36  a book length study of the Bell Features comics  and the touring of a related exhibition mounted by the National Gallery of Canada  Comic Art Traditions in Canada  1941 45  which together served to introduce English Canadian comics creators and fans to their lost heritage  35  Towards the middle of the 1970s  comics aimed at children gradually disappeared  The new breed of underground  alternative and independent comics was aimed at a more mature audience  which ran counter to the public s perception  as well as to legal restrictions  The first wave of alternative comics in the seventies was largely made up of science fiction and fantasy comics  made by budding cartoonists like Gene Day  Dave Sim  Augustine Funnell  Jim Craig  Ken Steacy  Dean Motter  and Vincent Marchesano  35   edit  New wave  mid 1970s 1980s  The mid 1970s saw the beginning of a new wave of Canadian comics  one in which the creators chose to remain in Canada  rather than seeking their fortunes south of the border  Richard Comely s Captain Canuck appeared in July 1975  the first appearance of a non satirical superhero in Canada since the 1940s  During the 1950s and 1960s  the idea of native comics seemed unattainable to Canadian kids  and the appearance of Captain Canuck gave these kids the optimism to make their own  37  This was followed up with James Waley s more professional  newsstand distributed Orb  which featured a number of talents that would later take part in the North American comics scene  38  The comics magazines showing up in Canada at the time suffered from promotion and distribution problems  however  getting most of their support from the fan press  Phil Seuling s California based comics distributor Bud Plant was supportive of these underground and alternative comics  though  and helped get them into stores  Eventually  distributors like Bud Plant and the emergence of specialty comic shops would form a distribution network for small press comics that would thrive independently of the traditional newsstands  39  Lynn Johnston s For Better or For Worse  the most widely distributed Canadian comic strip The world of comic strips saw a number of works pop up  Ben Wicks was doing The Outsiders and Wicks  Jim Unger s Herman debuted in 1975  Ted Martin s Pavlov in 1979  40  In 1978  Lynn Johnston  living in Lynn Lake  Manitoba  began For Better or For Worse  which was noted for following the lives of the Patterson family as they grew older in real time  and dealt with real life issues  The strip based a number of its storylines on Johnston s real life experiences with her own family  as well as social issues such as the midlife crisis  divorce  the coming out of one gay character  2 child abuse  and death  In 1985  she became the first female cartoonist to win a Reuben Award  41  and the Friends of Lulu added her to the Women Cartoonists Hall of Fame in 2002  The strip was very popular  appearing in over 2000 newspapers 41  in 25 countries  2  42  Editorial cartoonists held considerable sway between the 1950s through the 1970s  Former Prime Minister Joe Clark has been quoted that he lost votes in the election of 1980 due to political cartoons about him  33  They have also experienced the fear of censorship through the courts  or  libel chill   In 1979  Robert Bierman and the Victoria Times was the subject of a libel suit when he criticized the policies of William Vander Zalm  the British Columbia Minister of Human Resources  with a cartoon of the Minister pulling the wings off flies  When the courts ruled in Vander Zalm s favour  newspapers across the nation ran their own versions of the cartoon in support  until the BC Court of Appeal reversed the ruling in 1980  deeming the cartoon  fair comment   It was later acquired by the National Archives of Canada  8  43  44  Dave Sim proselytized the virtues of self publishing and creators  rights while pushing artistic boundaries with his series  Cerebus Captain Canuck and Orb both folded by 1976  but in Kitchener  Ontario in December 1977  Dave Sim s independent comic book Cerebus debuted  and would become the longest lived original Canadian comic book  45  Benefiting from distribution in the emerging comic shop market  46  it started as a Howard the Duck like parody of Barry Windsor Smith s Conan the Barbarian comics  The story eventually grew to fit Sim s expanding ambitions  both in content and technique  with its earth pig protagonist getting embroiled in politics  becoming prime minister of a powerful city state  then a Pope who ascends to the moon all within only the first third of its projected 300 issue run  Sim came to conceive the series as a self enclosed story  which itself would be divided into novels or graphic novels  which were gaining in prominence in the North American comic book world in the 1980s and 1990s  While Sim and his partner Gerhard s technical achievements impressed and influenced his peers  Sim also spoke out for creators  rights  promoted his peers and up and coming creators  and fiercely promoted self publishing as an ideal  Americans Jeff Smith with Bone and Terry Moore with Strangers in Paradise took Sim s cue  as did Canadian M Oak  Mark Oakley  with his long running Thieves and Kings  Eddie Campbell took Sim s personal advice to self publish the collected From Hell at the turn of the century  47  Sim also stirred considerable controversy  sometimes with the content of Cerebus  and sometimes with his editorials and personal interactions  45  David Boswell was amongst those in the 1980s who made the jump from the fanzine world when he self published his Reid Fleming  World s Toughest Milkman starting in 1980  40  From out of the same scene  40    Bill Marks started publishing the anthology Vortex in Toronto in 1982  48  Marks  Vortex Comics expanded into publishing other comics  The publisher gained publicity for Mister X  which employed the talents of Gilberto and Jaime Hernandez and  later  Torontonian Seth  Most notably  Marks picked up Chester Brown s Yummy Fur  a taboo breaking series which started out in 1983 as a self published  photocopied minicomic  It had generated some buzz  and Vortex started publishing it professionally at the end of 1986  The book s stories were a mix of genres  with the improvised  surreal Ed the Happy Clown  straight adaptations of the Gospels  and revealing  bare all autobiographical stories  Brown would become a major figure in Canadian comics  48  As the content of comics matured throughout the 1980s  they became the subject of increasing scrutiny  In 1986  a comic shop in Calgary  Alberta called Comic Legends was raided and charged with obscenity  In response  Derek McCulloch and Paul Stockton established the Comic Legends Legal Defense Fund to help retailers  distributors  publishers  and creators fight against obscenity charges  To raise funds  they published two True North anthologies of Canadian talent  40  During this time  large numbers of Canadian artists were making waves in the American comic book market as well  such as John Byrne  Gene Day and his brother Dan  Jim Craig  Rand Holmes  Geof Isherwood  Ken Steacy  Dean Motter  George Freeman and Dave Ross  49  Byrne was particularly popular for his work on X Men  and also originated Alpha Flight  about a team of Canadian superheroes  1   edit  1990s In 1990  Montr al based publisher Drawn and Quarterly began with an anthology title also named Drawn and Quarterly  It quickly picked up a number of other titles  such as Julie Doucet s semi autobiographical  bilingual Dirty Plotte  which  like Yummy Fur  had started out as a minicomic  Seth s Palookaville  illegal resident from the US Joe Matt s Peepshow  and Yummy Fur  which made the jump with its twenty fifth issue  At the time  an autobiographical comics trend took place  Brown  Seth and Matt in particular were thought of as something of a Toronto comics rat pack  depicting each other in each other s comics and doing signings and interviews together  50  Drawn and Quarterly was at the forefront of the maturation comic books saw in the 1990s  publishing and promoting the works of adult oriented Canadian and international artists  The publisher avoided genres like superheroes  which publisher Chris Oliveros saw as stifling comics  growth  2  These comics had artistic aspirations  51  and Graphic novels became increasingly prominent  with Brown s autobiographical The Playboy and I Never Liked You  and Seth s faux autobiographical It s a Good Life  If You Don t Weaken garnering considerable attention  A young hotshot from Calgary named Todd McFarlane had been making waves waves since the 1980s illustrating comics for DC and Marvel Comics  becoming a superstar writer artist for Spider Man  He eventually left to co found the creator owned comic publishing collective Image Comics  where he debuted Spawn  an enormously successful title of his own creation  Spawn holds the record for most copies sold of an independent comic  52  and was the most financially successful comics franchise of the decade  1  53   edit  21st Century Chester Brown s best selling Louis Riel was the first work in comics to receive a Canada Council grant  At the dawn of the 21st Century  the comics industry had changed considerably  The graphic novel had come into its own  and traditional comics sales dropped significantly  Louis Riel  who had been a major target of John Bengough s caricatures in the early days of Confederation  was the protagonist in Chester Brown s award winning  best selling 54   comic strip biography   With his graphic novels and book collections  he gained a wider audience than he had with his serial comic books  46  and he abandoned serial comics entirely to focus on original graphic novels after Louis Riel  Greater appreciation of the artform was shown when Brown and Seth became recipients of grants from the Canada Council for the Arts  55  56  Dave Sim s Cerebus completed its planned 26 year  300 issue run in 2004  46  57  Foreign comics  especially Japanese  became quite successful in Canada  and stood out for gaining large numbers of female fans  who had traditionally stayed away from comic books  58  They also had a significant influence on artists such as Bryan Lee O Malley and his Scott Pilgrim series  59  Due to differing social norms  the content of these comics are sometimes censored or ran afoul of Canadian customs officials  Incidental nudity could be interpreted by them as child pornography and result in jail terms  60  61  Drawn and Quarterly has become known as a house for art comics  translations of non English works  like Montr aler Michel Rabagliati s Paul series  62  and archive editions of classic comics  such as Wright s Little Nipper  The publisher has earned a reputation for the special attention they put into book design  and has played a pivotal r le in shaping comics  rise in artistic prominence  and in getting comics into mainstream book stores in both Canada and the US  63  D amp Q publisher Chris Oliveros  along with Art Spiegelman  lobbied bookstores to include a section for graphic novels  which would be subdivided by subject  64  Webcomics  such as Kate Beaton s Hark  A Vagrant  Ryan Sohmer and Lar deSouza s Looking for Group  and Karl Kerschl s The Abominable Charles Christopher  became an increasingly popular outlet for Canadian cartoonists  42  The popularity of Beaton s work has led to it being published in book form  with Time magazine placing it in the top 10 fiction books of 2011  65  The comics community in Canada has grown  and has grown appreciative of its talent  celebrating it with awards such as the Doug Wrights and Joe Shusters  66  as well as with classy events such as the international Toronto Comic Arts Festival  which has been cosponsored by the Toronto Public Library since 2009  67   edit  French Main article  Quebec comics The comics of Qu bec  also known as  BDQ   bande dessin e qu b coise   have followed a different path than those of English Canada  While newspapers tend to populate their funny pages with syndicated American comic strips  in general comics their have followed Franco Belgian trends  comics like Tintin and Asterix being particularly popular and influential  Comics also tend to be printed in the album format that is popular in Europe  68  Aside from humorous parodies  there is no superhero tradition in Qu bec comics  1  69   edit  Early history  1790s 1960s   Pour un d ner de No l   Raoul Barr   1902   the first comic strip to appear in a daily Qu bec newspaper  Barr  demonstrates an interest in movement  which he would develop later as a pioneer in animation Qu bec comics have alternately flourished and languished  seeing several brief periods of intense activity followed by long periods of inundation with foreign content  Comics first appeared in the humour pages of newspapers in the 19th century  following the trends coming from Europe  In the late 19th Century  Henri Julien published two books of political caricatures  L album drolatique du journal Le Farceur  after which the number of cartoonists began to increase in newspapers in Qu bec City and
