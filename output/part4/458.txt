Asia  a  It comprises the eastern half of the island of Timor  the nearby islands of Atauro and Jaco  and Oecusse  an exclave on the northwestern side of the island  within Indonesian West Timor  The small country of 15 410 km  6   5 400 sq mi  is located about 640 km  400 mi  northwest of Darwin  Australia  East Timor was colonized by Portugal in the 16th century  and was known as Portuguese Timor until Portugal s decolonization of the country  In late 1975  East Timor declared its independence  but later that year was invaded and occupied by Indonesia and was declared Indonesia s 27th

is believed that descendants from at least three waves of migration still live in East Timor  The first were related to the principal Australoid indigenous groups of New Guinea and Australia  and arrived before 40 000 years ago  Around 3000 BC  Austronesians migrated to Timor  and are thought to be associated with the development of agriculture on the island  citation needed  Thirdly  proto Malays arrived from south China and north Indochina  11 Before colonialism Timor was included in Chinese and Indian trading networks  being in the 14th century an exporter of aromatic sandalwood  slaves  honey and wax  Early European explorers report that the island had a number of small chiefdoms or princedoms in the early 16th century  Portuguese Timor Arms  1935 1975  12  The Portuguese established outposts in Timor and Maluku  Effective European occupation of a small part of the territory began in 1769  when the city of Dili was founded and the colony of Portuguese Timor declared  13  A definitive border between the Dutch colonised western half of the island and the Portuguese colonised eastern half of the island was established by the Hague Treaty of 1916  and it remains the international boundary between the successor states East Timor and Indonesia  For the Portuguese  East Timor remained little more than a neglected trading post until the late nineteenth century  with minimal investment in infrastructure  health  and education  Sandalwood remained the main export crop with coffee exports becoming significant in the mid nineteenth century  In places where Portuguese rule was asserted  it tended to be brutal and exploitative  14  At the beginning of the twentieth century  a faltering home economy prompted the Portuguese to extract greater wealth from its colonies  which was met with Timorese resistance  14  During World War II  the Japanese occupied Dili  and the mountainous interior became the scene of a guerrilla campaign  known as the Battle of Timor  Waged by Allied forces and Timorese volunteers against the Japanese  the struggle resulted in the deaths of between 40 000 and 70 000 Timorese  15  Following the end of the war  Portuguese control was reinstated  The decolonisation process instigated by the 1974 Portuguese revolution saw Portugal effectively abandon the colony of East Timor  A civil war between supporters of East Timorese political parties  Fretilin and the UDT  broke out in 1975 as UDT attempted a coup which Fretilin resisted with the help of local Portuguese military  16 Independence was unilaterally declared on November 28  1975  citation needed  The Indonesian government was fearful of an independent communist state within the Indonesian archipelago  and at the height of the Cold War  Western governments were supportive of Indonesia s position  The Indonesian military launched a full scale invasion of East Timor in December 1975  Indonesia declared East Timor as its 27th province on July 17  1976  17  The UN Security Council opposed the invasion and the territory s nominal status in the UN remained  non self governing territory under Portuguese administration   Demonstration for independence from Indonesia  Indonesia s occupation of East Timor was marked by violence and brutality  A detailed statistical report prepared for the Commission for Reception  Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor cited a minimum bound of 102 800 conflict related deaths in the period 1974 1999  namely  approximately 18 600 killings and 84 200  excess  deaths from hunger and illness  18  The East Timorese guerrilla force  Falintil  fought a campaign against the Indonesian forces from 1975 1999  The 1991 Dili Massacre was a turning point for the independence cause internationally  and an East Timor solidarity movement grew in Portugal  Australia  and the United States  Following the resignation of Indonesian President Suharto  a UN sponsored agreement between Indonesia and Portugal allowed for UN supervised popular referendum in August 1999  The resulting clear vote for independence was met with a punitive campaign of violence by Timorese pro integration militia with the support of elements of the Indonesian military  main article 1999 referendum   An Australian led international peacekeeping force  INTERFET  was sent  with Indonesian permission  until order was restored  The administration of East Timor was taken over by the UN through the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor  UNTAET  in October 1999  19  The INTERFET deployment ended in February 2000 with the transfer of military command to the UN  20  East Timorese independence was formalised on May 20  2002 with Xanana Gusm o sworn in as the country s first President  East Timor became a member of the UN on September 27  2002  In June 2006  Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri resigned as Prime Minister  21  and Jos  Ramos Horta was appointed as his successor  22  The following year  Gusm o declined another presidential term and in the build up to the April 2007 presidential elections there were renewed outbreaks of violence  Jos  Ramos Horta was elected President in the May 2007 election  23  Ramos Horta was critically injured in an attempted assassination in February 2008  Prime Minister Gusm o also faced gunfire separately but escaped unharmed  Australian reinforcements were immediately sent to help keep order  24  In 2006  the United Nations sent in security forces to restore order when unrest and factional fighting forced 15 percent of the population  155 000 people  to flee their homes  In March 2011  the UN handed off operational control of the police force to the East Timor authorities  but more than 1 200 UN police officers still patrol on the street  After the 2012 presidential election  the missions are scheduled to end  25  Politics Jos  Ramos Horta  The current President of East Timor  Main article  Politics of East Timor Government Palace in Dili  The head of state of East Timor is the President of East Timor  who is elected by popular vote for a five year term  Although the role is largely symbolic  the president does have veto power over certain types of legislation  Following elections  the president appoints the leader of the majority party or majority coalition as the Prime Minister of East Timor  As head of government  the prime minister presides over the Council of State or cabinet  The unicameral Timorese parliament is the National Parliament or Parlamento Nacional  whose members are elected by popular vote to a five year term  The number of seats can vary from a minimum of fifty two to a maximum of sixty five  though it exceptionally has eighty eight members at present  due to this being its first term of office  The East Timorese constitution was modelled on that of Portugal  The country is still in the process of building its administration and governmental institutions  Government departments include the Policia Nacional de Timor Leste  police   East Timor Ministry for State and Internal Administration  Civil Aviation Division of Timor Leste and Immigration Department of Timor Leste  Subdivisions Main articles  Districts of East Timor  Subdistricts of East Timor  and Sucos of East Timor East Timor is divided into thirteen administrative districts  The districts are subdivided into 65 subdistricts  442 sucos  villages  and 2 225 aldeias  hamlets   26  A clickable map of East Timor exhibiting its 13 administrative districts  Geography Map of East Timor showing cities and main roads  Main article  Geography of East Timor Tasitolu in Dili  Located in southeast Asia  27  the island of Timor is part of the Maritime Southeast Asia  and is the largest and easternmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands  To the north of the mountainous island are the Ombai Strait  Wetar Strait and the greater Banda Sea  to the south the Timor Sea separates the island from Australia  while to the west lies the Indonesian Province of East Nusa Tenggara  The highest mountain of East Timor is Tatamailau  also known as Mount Ramelau  at 2 963 meters  9 721 ft   East Timor lies between latitudes 8  and 10 S  and longitudes 124  and 128 E  The local climate is tropical and generally hot and humid  characterised by distinct rainy and dry seasons  The capital  largest city and main port is Dili  and the second largest city is the eastern town of Baucau  The easternmost area of Timor Leste consists of the Paitchau Range and Iralalaro area  This area is the first conservation area in Timor Leste  the Nino Konis Santana National Park  It contains the last remaining tropical dry forested area within the country  It hosts a number of unique plant and animal species and is sparsely populated  28  The northern coast is characterised by a number of coral reef systems that have been determined to be at risk  29  Economy Main article  Economy of East Timor Coffee production in the subdistricts of East Timor Prior to and during colonization  Timor was best known for its sandalwood  In late 1999  about 70  of the economic infrastructure of East Timor was destroyed by Indonesian troops citation needed  and anti independence militias  and 260 000 people fled westward  From 2002 to 2005  an international program led by the UN  manned by civilian advisers  5 000 peacekeepers  8 000 at peak  and 1 300 police officers  substantially reconstructed the infrastructure  By mid 2002  all but about 50 000 of the refugees had returned  One promising long term project is the joint development with Australia of petroleum and natural gas resources in the waters southeast of Timor  The Portuguese colonial administration granted concessions to Oceanic Exploration Corporation to develop the deposits  However  this was curtailed by the Indonesian invasion in 1976  The resources were divided between Indonesia and Australia with the Timor Gap Treaty in 1989  30  The treaty established guidelines for joint exploitation of seabed resources in the area of the  gap  left by then Portuguese Timor in the maritime boundary agreed between the two countries in 1972  31  Revenues from the  joint  area were to be divided 50  50   Woodside Petroleum and ConocoPhillips began development of some resources in the Timor Gap on behalf of the two governments in 1992  East Timor inherited no permanent maritime boundaries when it attained independence  repudiating the Timor Gap Treaty as illegal  A provisional agreement  the Timor Sea Treaty  signed when East Timor became independent on 20 May 2002  defined a Joint Petroleum Development Area  JPDA   and awarded 90  of revenues from existing projects in that area to East Timor and 10  to Australia  32  The first significant new development in the JPDA since Timorese independence is the largest petroleum resource in the Timor Sea  the Greater Sunrise gas field  Its exploitation was the subject of separate agreements in 2003 and 2005  Only 20  of the field lies within the JPDA and the rest in waters not subject to the treaty  though claimed by both countries   The initial  temporary agreement gave 82  of revenues to Australia and only 18  to East Timor  33  dead link  The government of East Timor has sought to negotiate a definite boundary with Australia at the halfway line between the countries  in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  The government of Australia preferred to establish the boundary at the end of the wide Australian continental shelf  as agreed with Indonesia in 1972 and 1991  Normally a dispute such as this would be referred to the International Court of Justice or the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea for an impartial decision  34  but the Australian government had withdrawn itself from these international jurisdictions  solely on matters relating to maritime boundaries  shortly before Timorese independence  35  36  Nevertheless  under public and diplomatic pressure  the Australian government offered instead a last minute concession on Greater Sunrise gas field royalties alone  37  On July 7  2005  an agreement was signed under which both countries would set aside the dispute over the maritime boundary  and East Timor would receive 50  of the revenues  estimated at A 26 billion or about US 20 billion over the lifetime of the project  38  from the Greater Sunrise development  Other developments within waters claimed by East Timor but outside the JPDA  Laminaria Corallina and Buffalo  continue to be exploited unilaterally by Australia  however  39  Subdistricts suffering from hunger in November 2007 In 2007  a bad harvest led to deaths in several parts of Timor Leste  In November 2007  eleven subdistricts still needed food supplied by international aid  40  East Timor also has a large and potentially lucrative coffee industry  which sells organic coffee to numerous Fair Trade retailers and on the open market  citation needed  Currently three foreign banks have a branch in Dili  Australia s ANZ  Portugal s Banco Nacional Ultramarino  and Indonesia s Bank Mandiri  There are no patent laws in East Timor  41  Demographics A Timorese in traditional dress Main article  Demographics of East Timor The population of East Timor is about one million  It has grown considerably recently  because of a high birth rate  but also because of the return of refugees  citation needed  The population is especially concentrated in the area around Dili  The Timorese are called Maubere collectively by some of their political organizations  an originally derogatory name turned into a name of pride by Fretilin  They consist of a number of distinct ethnic groups  most of whom are of mixed Malayo Polynesian and Melanesian Papuan descent  The largest Malayo Polynesian ethnic groups are the Tetum 42   or Tetun   100 000   primarily in the north coast and around Dili  the Mambae  80 000   in the central mountains  the Tukudede  63 170   in the area around Maubara and Liqui    the Galoli  50 000   between the tribes of Mambae and Makasae  the Kemak  50 000  in north central Timor island  and the Baikeno  20 000   in the area around Pante Macassar  The main tribes of predominantly Papuan origin include the Bunak  50 000   in the central interior of Timor island  the Fataluku  30 000   at the eastern tip of the island near Lospalos  and the Makasae  toward the eastern end of the island  In addition  like other former Portuguese colonies where interracial marriage was common  there is a smaller population of people of mixed Timorese and Portuguese origin  known in Portuguese as mesti os  The East Timorese mesti o best known internationally is Jos  Ramos Horta  the spokesman for the resistance movement in exile  and now President of East Timor  M rio Viegas Carrascal o  Indonesia s appointed governor between 1987 and 1992  is also a mesti o  East Timor also has a small Chinese minority  most of whom are Hakka  Most left after the Indonesian invasion  with most moving to Australia although many Sino Timorese have returned  including Pedro Lay  the Minister for Infrastructure  Religion Main article  Religion in East Timor Balide church  Dili Upon independence  East Timor became one of only two predominantly Roman Catholic countries in Asia  along with the Philippines   although nearby parts of Indonesia also have Catholic majorities  including West Timor and Flores  The population predominantly identifies as Roman Catholic  97    though local animist traditions have a persistent and strong influence on the culture  The number of churches has grown from 100 in 1974 to over 800 in 1994   43  Religious minorities include Muslims  1    including former Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri  and Protestants  1    including Taur Matan Ruak  Commander of the Falintil FDTL   Smaller Hindu  0 5    Buddhist  0 1   and traditional animist minorities make up the remainder  44  45  46  Church membership grew considerably under Indonesian rule  as Indonesia s state ideology Pancasila does not recognize traditional beliefs and requires all citizens to believe in God  Although the struggle was not about religion  as a deep rooted local institution the Church not only symbolized East Timor s distinction from predominantly Muslim Indonesia  but also played a significant role in the resistance movement  as personified by Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo  the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize laureate  47  The constitution acknowledges the Church s role among the East Timorese people although it also stipulates a secular state that guarantees freedom of religion to everyone  Languages Main article  Languages of East Timor Biggest language groups in sucos of East Timor  East Timor s two official languages are Portuguese and Tetum  which belongs to the Austronesian family of languages spoken throughout Southeast Asia  48  The predominant form of Tetum  known as Tetun Dili  grew out of the dialect favored by the colonizers at Dili  and thus has considerable Portuguese influence  but other dialects of Tetum are also widely used in the country  including Tetun Terik which is spoken along the southwestern coast  Indonesian and English are defined as working languages under the Constitution in the Final and Transitional Provisions  without setting a final date  Another fifteen indigenous languages are spoken  Bekais  Bunak  Dawan  Fataluku  Galoli  Habun  Idalaka  Kawaimina  Kemak  Lovaia  Makalero  Makasai  Mambai  Tokodede  and Wetarese  Under Indonesian rule  the use of Portuguese was banned  but it was used by the clandestine resistance  especially in communicating with the outside world  citation needed  The language  along with Tetum  gained importance as a symbol of resistance and freedom and was adopted as one of the two official languages for this reason  and as a link to nations in other parts of the world  It is now being taught and promoted widely with the help of Brazil  Portugal  and the Latin Union  although its prominence in official and public spheres has been met with some hostility from younger Indonesian educated Timorese  citation needed  According to the 2006 UN Development Report  using data from official census   under 5  49  of the Timorese population is proficient in Portuguese  However  the validity of this report has been questioned by members of the Timorese National Institute of Linguistics  50  which maintains that Portuguese is spoken by up to 25  of Timorese  with the number of speakers more than doubling in the last five years  citation needed  Along with other local languages  Tetum remains the most common means of communication between ordinary Timorese  while Indonesian is still widely used in the media and school from high school to university  A large proportion of words in Tetum are derived from Portuguese  but it also shares many Malay derived words with Indonesian  Many Indonesian words are still in common use in Tetum and other Timorese languages  particularly numbers  East Timor is a member of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries  CPLP   also known as the Lusophone Commonwealth  and a member of the Latin Union  It is the only independent state in Asia with Portuguese as an official language  although this is also one of the official languages of China s Special Administrative Region of Macau  Education About half the adult population are illiterate  51  Illiteracy is higher among women   52  Illiteracy was at 90  at the end of Portuguese rule citation needed   In 2006  10 30  of primary school age children did not attend school   52  The country has the National University of East Timor  Indonesian plays a considerable role within education citation needed   Since the departure of the Portuguese  schools have increased from 50 to more than 800  There are also 4 colleges  43  Health Life expectancy at birth was at 60 7 in 2007  51  The fertility rate is at six births per woman  51  Healthy life expectancy at birth was at 55 years in 2007  51  Government expenditure on health was at US  150  PPP  per person in 2006  51  Many people in East Timor lack safe drinking water  52  There were two hospitals and 14 village healthcare facilities in 1974  By 1994 there were 11 hospitals and 330 healthcare centres  43  In June 2011  the United Nations Population Fund released a report on The State of the World s Midwifery  It contained new data on the midwifery workforce and policies relating to newborn and maternal mortality for 58 countries  The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100 000 births for Timor Leste is 370  This is compared with 928 6 in 2008 and 1016 3 in 1990  The under 5 mortality rate  per 1 000 births is 60 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5 s mortality is 48  The aim of this report is to highlight ways in which the Millennium Development Goals can be achieved  particularly Goal 4   Reduce child mortality and Goal 5   improve maternal death  In Timor Leste the number of midwives per 1 000 live births is 8 and 1 in 44 shows us the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women  53  Culture Main article  Culture of East Timor The culture of East Timor reflects numerous influences  including Portuguese  Roman Catholic  and Malaysia  on the indigenous Austronesian and Melanesian cultures of Timor  Legend has it that a giant crocodile was transformed into the island of Timor  or Crocodile Island  as it is often called  East Timorese culture is heavily influenced by Austronesian legends  although the Catholic influence is also strong  There is a strong tradition of poetry  Prime Minister Xanana Gusm o  for example  is a distinguished poet  As for architecture  some Portuguese style buildings can be found  along with the traditional totem houses of the eastern region  These are known as uma lulik  sacred houses  in Tetum  and lee teinu  houses with legs  in Fataluku  Craftsmanship is also widespread  as is the weaving of traditional scarves or tais  Sports Main article  Sport in East Timor East Timor has joined many international sport associations  including the International Olympic Committee  IOC   The IOC board has granted full
