s fifth largest country  both by geographical area and by population with over 192 million people  11  12  It is the only Portuguese speaking country in the Americas and the largest lusophone country in the world  11  Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east  Brazil has a coastline of 7 491 km  4 655 mi   11  It is bordered on the north by Venezuela  Guyana  Suriname and the French overseas region of French Guiana  on the northwest by Colombia  on the west by Bolivia and Peru  on the southwest by Argentina and Paraguay and on the south by Uruguay  Numerous archipelagos form part of Brazilian territory  such as Fernando de Noronha  Rocas Atoll  Saint Peter and Paul Rocks  and Trindade and Martim Vaz  11  It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile  Brazil was a colony of Portugal from the landing of Pedro  lvares Cabral in 1500 until 1815  when it was elevated to the rank of kingdom and the United Kingdom of Portugal  Brazil and the Algarves was formed  The colonial bond was in fact broken in 1808  when the capital of the Portuguese colonial empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro  after Napoleon invaded Portugal  13 Independence was achieved in 1822 with the formation of the Empire of Brazil  a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system  The country became a presidential republic in 1889  when a military coup d  tat proclaimed the Republic  although the bicameral legislature  now called Congress  dates back to the ratification of the first constitution in 1824  13  Its current Constitution  formulated in 1988  defines Brazil as a Federal Republic  14  The Federation is formed by the union of the Federal District  the 26 States  and the 5 564 Municipalities  14  15  The

is called pau brasil  with the word brasil commonly given the etymology  red like an ember   formed from Latin brasa   ember   and the suffix  il  from  iculum or  ilium   19  20  21  As brazilwood produces a deep red dye  it was highly valued by the European cloth industry and was the earliest commercially exploited product from Brazil  Through the 16th century  massive amounts of brazilwood were harvested by indigenous peoples  mostly Tupi  along the Brazilian coast  who sold the timber to European traders  mostly Portuguese  but also French  in return for assorted European consumer goods  22  The official name of the land  in original Portuguese records  was the  Land of the Holy Cross   Terra da Santa Cruz   but European sailors and merchants commonly called it simply the  Land of Brazil   Terra do Brasil  on account of the brazilwood trade  The popular appellation eclipsed and eventually supplanted the official name  Early sailors sometimes also called it the  Land of Parrots   Terra di Papaga   In the Guarani language  an official language of Paraguay  Brazil is called  Pindorama   This was the name the natives gave to the region  meaning  land of the palm trees   History Main article  History of Brazil Portuguese colonization Main article  Colonial Brazil See also  Indigenous peoples in Brazil and Slavery in Brazil The land now called Brazil was claimed by Portugal in April 1500  on the arrival of the Portuguese fleet commanded by Pedro  lvares Cabral  23  The Portuguese encountered stone age natives divided into several tribes  most of whom spoke languages of the Tupi Guarani family  and fought among themselves  24  Though the first settlement was founded in 1532  colonization was effectively begun in 1534  when Dom Jo o III divided the territory into twelve hereditary captaincies  25  26  but this arrangement proved problematic and in 1549 the king assigned a Governor General to administer the entire colony  26  27  The Portuguese assimilated some of the native tribes 28  while others were enslaved or exterminated in long wars or by European diseases to which they had no immunity  29  30  By the mid 16th century  sugar had become Brazil s most important export 24  31  and the Portuguese imported African slaves 32  33  to cope with the increasing international demand  29  34  The first Christian mass in Brazil  1500  Through wars against the French  the Portuguese slowly expanded their territory to the southeast  taking Rio de Janeiro in 1567  and to the northwest  taking S o Lu s in 1615  35  They sent military expeditions to the Amazon rainforest and conquered British and Dutch strongholds  36  founding villages and forts from 1669  37  In 1680 they reached the far south and founded Sacramento on the bank of the Rio de la Plata  in the Eastern Strip region  present day Uruguay   38  At the end of the 17th century  sugar exports started to decline 39  but beginning in the 1690s  the discovery of gold by explorers in the region that would later be called Minas Gerais  General Mines  in current Mato Grosso and Goi s  saved the colony from imminent collapse  40  From all over Brazil  as well as from Portugal  thousands of immigrants came to the mines  41  The Spanish tried to prevent Portuguese expansion into the territory that belonged to them according to the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas  and succeeded in conquering the Eastern Strip in 1777  However  this was in vain as the Treaty of San Ildefonso  signed in the same year  confirmed Portuguese sovereignty over all lands proceeding from its territorial expansion  thus creating most of the current Brazilian borders  42  In 1808  the Portuguese royal family and the majority of the Portuguese nobility  fleeing the troops of the French Emperor Napoleon I that were invading Portugal and most of Central Europe  established themselves in the city of Rio de Janeiro  which thus became the seat of the entire Portuguese Empire  43  In 1815 Dom Jo o VI  then regent on behalf of his incapacitated mother  elevated Brazil from colony to sovereign Kingdom united with Portugal  43  In 1809 the Portuguese invaded French Guiana  which was returned to France in 1817  44  and in 1816 the Eastern Strip  subsequently renamed Cisplatina  45  Independence and empire Main articles  Brazilian Independence and Empire of Brazil Declaration of the Brazilian independence by Emperor Pedro I on 7 September 1822  After the Portuguese military had successfully repelled Napoleon s invasion  the King Jo o VI returned to Europe on 26 April 1821  leaving his elder son Prince Pedro de Alc ntara as regent to rule Brazil  46  The Portuguese government  guided by the new political regime imposed by the Liberal Revolution of 1820  attempted to turn Brazil into a colony once again  thus depriving it of its achievements since 1808  47  The Brazilians refused to yield and Prince Pedro stood by them declaring the country s independence from Portugal on 7 September 1822  48  On 12 October 1822  Pedro was declared the first Emperor of Brazil and crowned Dom Pedro I on 1 December 1822  49  The public flogging of a slave in Rio de Janeiro  From Jean Baptiste Debret  Voyage Pittoresque et Historique au Bresil  1834 1839   At that time most Brazilians were in favour of a monarchy and republicanism had little support  50  51  The subsequent Brazilian War of Independence spread through almost the entire territory  with battles in the northern  northeastern  and southern regions  52  The last Portuguese soldiers surrendered on 8 March 1824 53  and independence was recognized by Portugal on 29 August 1825  54  The first Brazilian constitution was promulgated on 25 March 1824  after its acceptance by the municipal councils across the country  55  56  57  58  Pedro I abdicated on 7 April 1831 and went to Europe to reclaim his daughter s crown  leaving behind his five year old son and heir  who was to become Dom Pedro II  59  As the new emperor could not exert his constitutional prerogatives until he reached maturity  a regency was created  60  Disputes between political factions led to rebellions and an unstable  almost anarchical  regency  61  It is estimated that from 30 to 40  of the population of the Province of Gr o Par  died during the Cabanagem revolt  62  The rebellious factions  however  were not in revolt against the monarchy  63  64  even though some declared the secession of the provinces as independent republics  but only so long as Pedro II was a minor  65  Because of this  Pedro II was prematurely declared of age and  Brazil was to enjoy nearly half a century of internal peace and rapid material progress   66  Brazilian forces  in blue uniform  engage the Paraguayan army  some in red uniform and other shirtless  during the Paraguayan War  Despite the loss of Cisplatina in 1828 when it became an independent nation known as Uruguay  67  Brazil won three international wars during the 58 year reign of Pedro II  the Platine War  the Uruguayan War and the Paraguayan War  which left over 50 000 dead  68  and witnessed the consolidation of representative democracy  mainly due to successive elections and unrestricted freedom of the press  69  Most importantly  slavery was extinguished after a slow but steady process that began with the end of the international traffic in slaves in 1850 70  and ended with the complete abolition of slavery in 1888  71  The slave population had been in decline since Brazil s independence  in 1823  29  of the Brazilian population were slaves but by 1887 this had fallen to 5   72  When the monarchy was overthrown on 15 November 1889 73  there was little desire in Brazil to change the form of government 74  and Pedro II was at the height of his popularity among his subjects  75  76  However  he  bore prime  perhaps sole  responsibility for his own overthrow   77  After the death of his two sons  Pedro believed that  the imperial regime was destined to end with him   78  He cared little for the regime s fate 79  80  and so neither did anything  nor allowed anyone else to do anything  to prevent the military coup  backed by former slave owners who resented the abolition of slavery  81  82  83  Early republic Main articles  Rep blica Velha  Estado Novo  Brazil   and Brazilian Second Republic The Brazilian coup d  tat of 1930 raised Get lio Vargas  center with military uniform but no hat  to power  He ruled the country for fifteen years  At the beginning of the republican government it was little more than a military dictatorship  73  and the new constitution restricted political rights  such as the right to vote  84  85  yet provided for direct elections to be held in 1894  86  However  already in 1891  from the unfoldings of the encilhamento bubble 87  88  and of the 1st naval revolt  the country entered in a prolonged cycle of financial  social and political instability  that would extend until the 1920s keeping the country plagued by several rebellions  both civilian 89  90  91  as military  92  93  94  which little by little undermined the regime in a such extent  that by 1930 it was possible for the defeated presidential candidate Get lio Vargas  supported by the majority of military  95  to lead a coup d  tat and assume the presidency  96  Vargas and the military  who were supposed to assume the government temporarily to implement democratic reforms related to 1891 s Constitution  closed the Congress and ruled with emergency powers  replacing the states  governors with their supporters  97  98  Under the Claiming of the broken promises of changing  in 1932 the oligarchy of S o Paulo tried to regain the power 99  and in 1935 the Communists rebelled  100  having both been defeated  However  the communist threat served as an excuse for Vargas to preclude elections launching another coup d  tat in 1937  creating a full dictatorship 101  102  103  104  In May 1938  there was another failed attempt to take over the power by local fascists  105  106  In foreign policy  the success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries 107  in the early years of this period  was followed by a failed attempt to permanently exert a prominent role in the League of Nations 108  after military involvement in World War I  109  110  111  Notwithstanding  Brazil remained neutral at the beginning of World War II until the Pan American Conference of January 1942 when Brazil stood alongside the U S A  severing diplomatic relations with the Axis powers  112  In retaliation  Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy extended their submarine warfare against Brazil  which led the country to enter the war on the allied side in August of that year  113  114  With the allied victory in 1945 and the end of the Nazi fascist regimes in Europe  Vargas s position became unsustainable and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup  115  Democracy was reinstated and General Eurico Gaspar Dutra was elected president taking office in 1946  116  Having returned to power democratically elected at the end of 1950  Vargas committed suicide in August 1954 amid a political crisis  117  118  Contemporary era Main articles  Military dictatorship  Brazil  and History of Brazil since 1985 The transition from Fernando Henrique Cardoso to Lu s In cio Lula da Silva indicated that Brazil had finally succeeded in achieving its long sought political stability  Several brief interim governments succeeded after Vargas s suicide  119 Juscelino Kubitscheck became president in 1956 and assumed a conciliatory posture towards the political opposition that allowed him to govern without major crises  120  The economy and industrial sector grew remarkably  121  but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of Bras lia  inaugurated in 1960  122  His successor was J nio Quadros  who resigned in 1961 less than a year after taking office  123  His vice president  Jo o Goulart  assumed the presidency  but aroused strong political opposition 124  and was deposed in April 1964 by a coup that resulted in a military regime  125  The new regime was intended to be transitory 126  but it gradually closed in on itself and became a full dictatorship with the promulgation of the Fifth Institutional Act in 1968  127  The repression of the dictatorship s opponents  including urban guerrillas  128  was harsh  but not as brutal as in other Latin American countries  129  Due to the extraordinary economic growth  known as an  economic miracle   the regime reached its highest level of popularity in the years of repression  130  General Ernesto Geisel became president in 1974 and began his project of re democratization through a process that he said would be  slow  gradual and safe   131  132  Geisel ended the military indiscipline that had plagued the country since 1889  133  as well as the torture of political prisoners  censorship of the press  134  and finally  the dictatorship itself  after he extinguished the Fifth Institutional Act  127  However  the military regime continued  under his chosen successor General Jo o Figueiredo  to complete the transition to full democracy  135  The civilians fully returned to power in 1985 when Jos  Sarney assumed the presidency 136  but  by the end of his term  he had become extremely unpopular due to the uncontrollable economic crisis and unusually high inflation  137  Sarney s unsuccessful government allowed the election in 1989 of the almost unknown Fernando Collor  who was subsequently impeached by the National Congress in 1992  138  Collor was succeeded by his Vice President Itamar Franco  who appointed Fernando Henrique Cardoso as Minister of Finance  Cardoso produced a highly successful Plano Real  Royal or Real Plan  139  that granted stability to the Brazilian economy 140  and he was elected as president in 1994 and again in 1998  141  The peaceful transition of power to Lu s In cio Lula da Silva  who was elected in 2002 and re elected in 2006  proved that Brazil had finally succeeded in achieving its long sought political stability  142  Lula was succeeded in 2011 by the current president  Dilma Rousseff  143  Geography Main article  Geography of Brazil See also  List of countries and outlying territories by total area Topography map of Brazil Brazil occupies a large area along the eastern coast of South America and includes much of the continent s interior  144  sharing land borders with Uruguay to the south  Argentina and Paraguay to the southwest  Bolivia and Peru to the west  Colombia to the northwest  and Venezuela  Suriname  Guyana and the French overseas department of French Guiana to the north  It shares a border with every country in South America except for Ecuador and Chile  It also encompasses a number of oceanic archipelagos  such as Fernando de Noronha  Rocas Atoll  Saint Peter and Paul Rocks  and Trindade and Martim Vaz  11  Its size  relief  climate  and natural resources make Brazil geographically diverse  144  Including its Atlantic islands  Brazil lies between latitudes 6 N and 34 S  and longitudes 28  and 74 W  Brazil is the fifth largest country in the world  after Russia  Canada  China and the United States  and third largest in the Americas  with a total area of 8 514 876 599 km2  3 287 612 sq mi   145  including 55 455 km2  21 411 sq mi  of water  11  It spans three time zones  from UTC 4 in the western states  to UTC 3 in the eastern states  and the official time of Brazil  and UTC 2 in the Atlantic islands  146  Brazil is the only country in the world that lies on the equator while having contiguous territory outside the tropics  Brazilian topography is also diverse and includes hills  mountains  plains  highlands  and scrublands  Much of the terrain lies between 200 metres  660 ft  and 800 metres  2 600 ft  in elevation  147  The main upland area occupies most of the southern half of the country  147  The northwestern parts of the plateau consist of broad  rolling terrain broken by low  rounded hills  147  The southeastern section is more rugged  with a complex mass of ridges and mountain ranges reaching elevations of up to 1 200 metres  3 900 ft   147  These ranges include the Mantiqueira and Espinha o mountains and the Serra do Mar  147  In the north  the Guiana Highlands form a major drainage divide  separating rivers that flow south into the Amazon Basin from rivers that empty into the Orinoco River system  in Venezuela  to the north  The highest point in Brazil is the Pico da Neblina at 2 994 metres  9 823 ft   and the lowest is the Atlantic Ocean  11  Brazil has a dense and complex system of rivers  one of the world s most extensive  with eight major drainage basins  all of which drain into the Atlantic  148  Major rivers include the Amazon  the world s second longest river and the largest in terms of volume of water   the Paran  and its major tributary the Igua u  which includes the Iguazu Falls   the Negro  S o Francisco  Xingu  Madeira and Tapaj s rivers  148  Climate Main article  Climate of Brazil Snow in S o Joaquim  Santa Catarina in 2010  South  and tropical climate in Fernando de Noronha  Pernambuco   Northeast   The climate of Brazil comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a large area and varied topography  but most of the country is tropical  11  According to the K ppen system  Brazil hosts five major climatic subtypes  equatorial  tropical  semiarid  highland tropical  temperate  and subtropical  The different climatic conditions produce environments ranging from equatorial rainforests in the north and semiarid deserts in the northeast  to temperate coniferous forests in the south and tropical savannas in central Brazil  149  Many regions have starkly different microclimates  150  151  An equatorial climate characterizes much of northern Brazil  There is no real dry season  but there are some variations in the period of the year when most rain falls  149  Temperatures average 25  C  77  F   151  with more significant temperature variation between night and day than between seasons  150  Over central Brazil rainfall is more seasonal  characteristic of a savanna climate  150  This region is as extensive as the Amazon basin but has a very different climate as it lies farther south at a higher altitude  149  In the interior northeast  seasonal rainfall is even more extreme  The semiarid climatic region generally receives less than 800 millimetres  31 5 in  of rain  152  most of which generally falls in a period of three to five months of the year 153  and occasionally less than this  creating long periods of drought  150  Brazil s 1877 78 Grande Seca  Great Drought   the most severe ever recorded in Brazil  154  caused approximately half a million deaths  155  The one from 1915 was devastating too  156  South of Bahia  near S o Paulo  the distribution of rainfall changes  with rain falling throughout the year  149  The south enjoys temperate conditions  with cool winters and average annual temperatures not exceeding 18  C  64 4  F   151  winter frosts are quite common  with occasional snowfall in the higher areas  149  150  Biodiversity Main articles  Wildlife of Brazil and Deforestation in Brazil The Amazon Rainforest  the largest tropical forest in the world  Brazil s large territory comprises different ecosystems  such as the Amazon Rainforest  recognized as having the greatest biological diversity in the world  157  with the Atlantic Forest and the Cerrado  sustaining the greatest biodiversity  158  In the south  the Araucaria pine forest grows under temperate conditions  158  The rich wildlife of Brazil reflects the variety of natural habitats  Scientists estimate that the total number of plant and animal species in Brazil could approach four million  158  Larger mammals include pumas  jaguars  ocelots  rare bush dogs  and foxes  peccaries  tapirs  anteaters  sloths  opossums  and armadillos are abundant  Deer are plentiful in the south  and many species of New World monkeys are found in the northern rain forests  158  159  Concern for the environment has grown in response to global interest in environmental issues  160  Environment See also  Conservation in Brazil The natural heritage of Brazil is severely threatened by cattle ranching and agriculture  logging  mining  resettlement  oil and gas extraction  over fishing  wildlife trade  dams and infrastructure  water contamination  climate change  fire  and invasive species  157  In many areas of the country  the natural environment is threatened by development  161  Construction of highways has opened up previously remote areas for agriculture and settlement  dams have flooded valleys and inundated wildlife habitats  and mines have scarred and polluted the landscape  160  162  At least 70 dams are said to be planned for the Amazon region  including controversial Belo Monte hydroelectric dam  163  Politics Main article  Politics of Brazil The National Congress in Bras lia  the capital of Brazil  The Brazilian Federation is the  indissoluble union  of three distinct political entities  the States  the Municipalities and the Federal District  14  The Union  the states and the Federal District  and the municipalities  are the  spheres of government   The Federation is set on five fundamental principles  14 sovereignty  citizenship  dignity of human beings  the social values of labour and freedom of enterprise  and political pluralism  The classic tripartite branches of government  executive  legislative  and judicial under the checks and balances system   is formally established by the Constitution  14  The executive and legislative are organized independently in all three spheres of government  while the judiciary is organized only at the federal and state Federal District spheres  All members of the executive and legislative branches are directly elected  164  165  166  Judges and other judicial officials are appointed after passing entry exams  164  Brazil has a multi party system for most of its history  Voting is compulsory for the literate between 18 and 70 years old and optional for illiterates and those between 16 and 18 or beyond 70  14  Together with several smaller parties  four political parties stand out  Workers  Party  PT   Brazilian Social Democracy Party  PSDB   Brazilian Democratic Movement Party  PMDB   and Democrats  DEM   Almost all governmental and administrative functions are exercised by authorities and agencies affiliated to the Executive  The form of government is that of a democratic republic  with a presidential system  14  The president is both head of state and head of government of the Union and is elected for a four year term  14  with the possibility of re election for a second successive term  The current president is Dilma Rousseff who was inaugurated on January 1  2011  167  The President appoints the Ministers of State  who assist in government  14  Legislative houses in each political entity are the main source of law in Brazil  The National Congress is the Federation s bicameral legislature  consisting of the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate  Judiciary authorities exercise jurisdictional duties almost exclusively  Fifteen political parties are represented in Congress  It is common for politicians to switch parties  and thus the proportion of congressional seats held by particular parties changes regularly  The largest political parties are the Workers  Party  PT   Democrats  DEM   Brazilian Democratic Movement Party  PMDB center   Brazilian Social Democratic Party  PSDB   Progressive Party  PP   Brazilian Labor Party  PTB   Liberal Party  PL   Brazilian Socialist Party  PSB   Popular Socialist Party  PPS   Democratic Labor Party  PDT   and the Communist Party of Brazil  PCdoB   168  Law Main articles  Law of Brazil and Crime in Brazil Supreme Federal Court building at the Three Powers Plaza  Brazilian law is based on Roman Germanic traditions 169  and civil law concepts prevail over common law practice  Most of Brazilian law is codified  although non codified statutes also represent a substantial part  playing a complementary role  Court decisions set out interpretive guidelines  however  they are seldom binding on other specific cases  Doctrinal works and the works of academic jurists have strong influence in law creation and in law cases  The legal system is based on the Federal Constitution  which was promulgated on 5 October 1988  and is the fundamental law of Brazil  All other legislation and court decisions must conform to its rules  170  As of April 2007 update   there have been 53 amendments  States have their own constitutions  which must not contradict the Federal Constitution  171  Municipalities and the Federal District have  organic laws   leis org nicas   which act in a similar way to constitutions  14  172  Legislative entities are the main source of statutes  although in certain matters judiciary and executive bodies may enact legal norms  14  Jurisdiction is administered by the judiciary entities  although in rare situations the Federal Constitution allows the Federal Senate to pass on legal judgments  14  There are also specialized military  labor  and electoral courts  14  The highest court is the Supreme Federal Court  This system has been criticised over the last few decades for the slow pace of decision making  Lawsuits on appeal may take several years to resolve  and in some cases more than a decade elapses before definitive rulings  173  Nevertheless  the Supreme Federal Tribunal was the first court in the world to transmit its sessions on television  and also via YouTube  174  175  More recently  in December 2009  the Supreme Court adopted Twitter to display items on the day planner of the ministers  to inform the daily actions of the Court and the most important decisions made by them  176  Brazil continues to have high crime rates in a number of statistics  despite recent improvements  More than 500 000 people have been killed by firearms in
