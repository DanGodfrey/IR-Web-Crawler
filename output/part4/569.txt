power projection from the sea  6  using the mobility of the United States Navy to deliver combined arms task forces rapidly  It is one of seven uniformed services of the United States  In the civilian leadership structure of the United States military  the Marine Corps is a component of the United States Department of the Navy  7  8  often working closely with U S  naval forces for training  transportation  and logistic purposes  however  in the military leadership structure the Marine Corps is a separate branch  9  Captain Samuel Nicholas formed two battalions of Continental Marines on 10 November 1775 in Philadelphia as naval infantry  10  Since then  the mission of the Marine Corps has evolved with changing military doctrine and American foreign policy  The Marine Corps has served in every American armed conflict and attained prominence in the 20th century when its theories and practices of amphibious warfare proved prescient and ultimately formed the cornerstone of the Pacific campaign of World War II  11  By the mid 20th century  the Marine Corps had become the dominant theorist and practitioner of amphibious warfare  12  13  14  Its ability to rapidly respond on short notice to expeditionary crises gives it a strong role in the implementation and execution of American foreign policy  15  As of 2010 the United States Marine Corps included just under 203 000 active duty Marines and just under 40 000 reserve Marines  2  It is the smallest of the United States  armed forces in the Department of Defense  The United States Coast Guard is smaller  about one fifth the size of the Marine Corps  but it does not normally operate under the DoD  The Marine Corps is nonetheless larger than the armed forces of many significant military powers  being larger than the active duty Israel Defense Forces and the active duty British Army  16  17  Contents 1 Mission 1 1 Historical mission 1 2 Capabilities 1 3 Doctrine 2 History 2 1 Origins 2 2 Interim  Civil War to World War I

introduced under the National Security Act of 1947  it has three primary areas of responsibility  The seizure or defense of advanced naval bases and other land operations to support naval campaigns  The development of tactics  technique  and equipment used by amphibious landing forces in coordination with the Army and Air Force  and Such other duties as the President may direct  This last clause  while seemingly redundant given the President s position as Commander in chief  is a codification of the expeditionary duties of the Marine Corps  It derives from similar language in the Congressional acts  For the Better Organization of the Marine Corps  of 1834  and  Establishing and Organizing a Marine Corps  of 1798  In 1951  the House of Representatives  Armed Services Committee called the clause  one of the most important statutory   and traditional   functions of the Marine Corps   It noted that the corps has more often than not performed actions of a non naval nature  including its famous actions in Tripoli  the War of 1812  Chapultepec  and numerous counter insurgency and occupational duties  such as those in Central America   World War I  and the Korean War  While these actions are not accurately described as support of naval campaigns nor as amphibious warfare  their common thread is that they are of an expeditionary nature  using the mobility of the Navy to provide timely intervention in foreign affairs on behalf of American interests  18  In addition to its primary duties  the Marine Corps has missions in direct support of the White House and the State Department  The Marine Band  dubbed the  President s Own  by Thomas Jefferson  provides music for state functions at the White House  19  Marines guard presidential retreats  including Camp David  and the Marines of the Executive Flight Detachment of HMX 1 provide helicopter transport to the President and Vice President  using the call signs  Marine One  and  Marine Two  respectively  20  By authority of the 1946 Foreign Service Act  the Marine Security Guards of the Marine Embassy Security Command provide security for American embassies  legations  and consulates at more than 140 posts worldwide  21   edit  Historical mission The Marine Corps was founded to serve as an infantry unit aboard naval vessels and was responsible for the security of the ship and its crew by conducting offensive and defensive combat during boarding actions and defending the ship s officers from mutiny  to the latter end  their quarters on ship were often strategically positioned between the officers  quarters and the rest of the vessel  Continental Marines manned raiding parties  both at sea and ashore  America s first amphibious assault landing occurred early in the Revolutionary War on 3 March 1776 as the Marines gained control of Fort Montague and Fort Nassau  a British ammunition depot and naval port in New Providence  the Bahamas  The role of the Marine Corps has expanded significantly since then  as the importance of its original naval mission declined with changing naval warfare doctrine and the professionalization of the naval service  the corps adapted by focusing on what was former secondary missions ashore  The Advanced Base Doctrine of the early 20th century codified their combat duties ashore  outlining the use of Marines in the seizure of bases and other duties on land to support naval campaigns  Throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries  Marine detachments served aboard Navy cruisers  battleships and carriers  Marine detachments  generally one platoon per cruiser  a company for battleships or carriers  served their traditional duties as ship s landing force  manning the ship s weapons and providing shipboard security  Marine detachments were augmented by members of the ship s company for landing parties  especially in the Caribbean and Mexican campaigns of the early 20th centuries  Marines would develop tactics and techniques of amphibious assault on defended coastlines in time for use in World War II  22  During World War II  Marines continued to serve on capital ships  They often were assigned to man anti aircraft batteries  When gun cruisers were retired by the 1960s  the remaining Marine detachments were only seen on battleships and carriers  Its original mission of providing shipboard security finally ended in the 1990s when nuclear weapons were withdrawn from active deployment and the battleships were retired   edit  Capabilities Marines from the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit The Marine Corps fulfills a vital role in national security as an amphibious  expeditionary  air ground combined arms task force  capable of forcible entry from the air  land  and sea  It is capable of asymmetric warfare with conventional  irregular  and hybrid forces  While the Marine Corps does not employ any unique combat arms  as a force it has the unique ability to rapidly deploy a combined arms task force to almost anywhere in the world within days  The basic structure for all deployed units is a Marine Air Ground Task Force  MAGTF  that integrates a ground combat element  an aviation combat element and a logistics combat element under a common command element  While the creation of joint commands under the Goldwater Nichols Act has improved inter service coordination between each branch  the Corps  ability to permanently maintain integrated multi element task forces under a single command provides a smoother implementation of combined arms warfare principles  11  The close integration of disparate Marine units stems from an organizational culture centered around the infantry  Every other Marine capability exists to support the infantry  Unlike some Western militaries  the Corps remained conservative against theories proclaiming the ability of new weapons to win wars independently  For example  Marine aviation has always been focused on close air support and has remained largely uninfluenced by air power theories proclaiming that strategic bombing can single handedly win wars  22  Bravo Battery  1st Battalion  11th Marines  a k a  the Beastmasters fight off Iraqi unit on March 26  2003 This focus on the infantry is matched with the doctrine that  Every Marine is a rifleman   a focus of Commandant Alfred M  Gray  Jr   emphasizing the infantry combat abilities of every Marine  All Marines  regardless of military specialization  receive training as a rifleman  and all officers receive additional training as infantry platoon commanders  23  For example  at Wake Island  when all of the Marine aircraft were shot down  pilots continued the fight as ground officers  leading supply clerks and cooks in a final defensive effort  24  As a result  a large degree of initiative and autonomy is expected of junior Marines  particularly the NCOs  corporals and sergeants   as compared with many other military organizations  The Marine Corps emphasizes authority and responsibility downward to a greater degree than the other military services  Flexibility of execution is implemented via an emphasis on  commander s intent  as a guiding principle for carrying out orders  specifying the end state but leaving open the method of execution  25  The amphibious assault techniques developed for World War II evolved  with the addition of air assault and maneuver warfare doctrine  into the current  Operational Maneuver from the Sea  doctrine of power projection from the seas  6  The Marines are credited with the development of helicopter insertion doctrine and were the earliest in the American military to widely adopt maneuver warfare principles which emphasize low level initiative and flexible execution  In light of recent warfare that has strayed from the Corps  traditional missions  26  it has renewed an emphasis on amphibious capabilities  27  The Marine Corps relies on the Navy for sealift to provide its rapid deployment capabilities  In addition to basing a third of the Fleet Marine Force in Japan  Marine Expeditionary Units  MEU  are typically stationed at sea  This allows the ability to function as first responders to international incidents  The United States Army now maintains light infantry units capable of rapid worldwide deployment  but those units do not match the combined arms integration of a MAGTF and lack the logistics that the Navy provides  11  For this reason  the Marine Corps is often assigned to non combat missions such as the evacuation of Americans from unstable countries and providing humanitarian relief during natural disasters  In larger conflicts  Marines act as a stopgap  to get into and hold an area until larger units can be mobilized  The Corps performed this role in World War I and the Korean War  where Marines were the first significant combat units deployed from the United States and held the line until the country could mobilize for war  28  To aid rapid deployment  the Maritime Pre Positioning System was developed  fleets of container ships are positioned throughout the world with enough equipment and supplies for a Marine Expeditionary Force to deploy for 30 days   edit  Doctrine Two small manuals published during the 1930s would establish USMC doctrine in two areas  The Small Wars Manual laid the framework for Marine counter insurgency operations from Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan while the Tentative Landing Operations Manual established the doctrine for the amphibious operations of World War II   Operational Maneuver from the Sea  is the current doctrine of power projection  6  As an expeditionary force  the USMC is planning to reduce its logistical requirements and by 2025 eliminate all liquid fuel use other than for highly efficient vehicles  29   edit  History Main article  History of the United States Marine Corps  edit  Origins Continental Marines land at New Providence during the Battle of Nassau  The United States Marine Corps traces its institutional roots to the Continental Marines of the American Revolutionary War  formed by Captain Samuel Nicholas by a resolution of the Second Continental Congress on 10 November 1775  to raise 2 battalions of Marines  That date is regarded and celebrated as the date of the Marine Corps   birthday   At the end of the American Revolution  both the Continental Navy and Continental Marines were disbanded in April 1783  The institution itself would not be resurrected until July 11  1798  At that time  in preparation for the Quasi War with France  Congress created the United States Marine Corps  30  Marines had been enlisted by the War Department as early as August 1797 31  for service in the new build frigates authorized by the Congressional  Act to provide a Naval Armament  of March 18  1794  32  which specified the numbers of Marines to be recruited for each frigate  The Marines  most famous action of this period occurred during the First Barbary War  1801 1805  against the Barbary pirates  33  when William Eaton and First Lieutenant Presley O Bannon led eight Marines and 500 mercenaries in an effort to capture Tripoli  Though they only reached Derna  the action at Tripoli has been immortalized in the Marines  hymn and the Mameluke Sword carried by Marine officers  34  During the War of 1812  Marine naval detachments took part in the great frigate duels that characterized the war  which were the first American victories in the conflict  Their most significant contributions were delaying the British march to Washington  D C  at the Battle of Bladensburg and holding the center of Gen  Andrew Jackson s defensive line at the defense of New Orleans  By the end of the war  the Marines had acquired a well deserved reputation as expert marksmen  especially in ship to ship actions  34  After the war  the Marine Corps fell into a depression that ended with the appointment of Archibald Henderson as its fifth Commandant in 1820  Under his tenure  the Corps took on expeditionary duties in the Caribbean  the Gulf of Mexico  Key West  West Africa  the Falkland Islands  and Sumatra  Commandant Henderson is credited with thwarting President Jackson s attempts to combine and integrate the Marine Corps with the Army  34  Instead  Congress passed the Act for the Better Organization of the Marine Corps in 1834  stipulating that the Corps was part of the Department of the Navy as a sister service to the Navy  35  This would be the first of many times that the existence of the Corps was challenged  James Walker  Storming of Chapultepec  1847 Commandant Henderson volunteered the Marines for service in the Seminole Wars of 1835  personally leading nearly half of the entire Corps  two battalions  to war  A decade later  in the Mexican American War  1846 1848   the Marines made their famed assault on Chapultepec Palace in Mexico City  which would be later celebrated by the phrase  From The Halls of Montezuma  in Marines  hymn  In the 1850s  the Marines would see further service in Panama and Asia  escorting Matthew Perry s East India Squadron on its historic trip to the Far East  36  With their vast service in foreign engagements  the Marine Corps played a moderate role in the Civil War  1861 1865   their most prominent task was blockade duty  As more and more states seceded from the Union  about half of the Corps  officers left the Union to join the Confederacy and form the Confederate States Marine Corps  which ultimately played little part in the war  The battalion of recruits formed for the First Battle of Bull Run  First Manassas  performed poorly  retreating with the rest of the Union forces  28  Blockade duty included sea based amphibious operations to secure forward bases  In late November  1861  Marines and sailors landed a reconnaissance in force from the USS Flag at Tybee Island  Georgia  to occupy the Lighthouse and Martello Tower on the northern end of the island  It would later be the Army base for bombardment of Fort Pulaski  37  Five Marines with fixed bayonets  and their NCO with his sword at the Washington Navy Yard  1864  edit  Interim  Civil War to World War I The remainder of the 19th century was marked by declining strength and introspection about the mission of the Marine Corps  The Navy s transition from sail to steam put into question the need for Marines on naval ships  Meanwhile  Marines served as a convenient resource for interventions and landings to protect American lives and interests overseas  The Corps was involved in over 28 separate interventions in the 30 years from the end of the American Civil War to the end of 19th century  They would be called upon to stem political and labor unrest within the United States  38  Under Commandant Jacob Zeilin s tenure  Marine customs and traditions took shape  the Corps adopted the Marine Corps emblem on 19 November 1868  It was during this time that  The Marines  Hymn  was first heard  Around 1883  the Marines adopted their current motto  Semper Fidelis   English  Always Faithful   34  John Philip Sousa  the musician and composer  enlisted as a Marine apprentice at the age of 13  serving from 1867 until 1872  and again from 1880 to 1892 as the leader of the Marine Band  During the Spanish American War  1898   Marines led American forces ashore in the Philippines  Cuba  and Puerto Rico  demonstrating their readiness for deployment  At Guant namo Bay  Cuba  the Marines seized an advanced naval base that remains in use today  Between 1899 and 1916  the Corps continued its record of vigorous participation in foreign expeditions  including the Philippine American War  the Boxer Rebellion in China  1899 1901   Panama  the Cuban Pacifications  the Perdicaris Incident in Morocco  Veracruz  Santo Domingo  and the Banana Wars in Haiti and Nicaragua  the experiences gained in counter insurgency and guerrilla operations during this period were consolidated into the Small Wars Manual  39   edit  World War I Georges Scott  American Marines in Belleau Wood  1918 During World War I veteran Marines served a central role in the late American entry into the conflict  Unlike the Army  the Marine Corps had a deep pool of officers and NCOs with battle experience  and experienced a smaller expansion  Here  the Marines fought their famed battle at Belleau Wood  creating the Marines  reputation in modern history  While its previous expeditionary experiences had not earned it much acclaim in the Western world  the Marines  ferocity and toughness in France earned them the respect of the Germans  who rated them of stormtrooper quality  Though Marines and American media reported that Germans had nicknamed them Teufel Hunden as meaning  Devil Dogs   there is no evidence of this in German records  as Teufelshunde would be the proper German phrase   nevertheless  the name stuck  40  The Corps had entered the war with 511 officers and 13 214 enlisted personnel  and by 11 November 1918 had reached a strength of 2 400 officers and 70 000 men  41  Between the World Wars  the Marine Corps was headed by Commandant John A  Lejeune  and under his leadership  the Corps presciently studied and developed amphibious techniques that would be of great use in World War II  Many officers  including Lt  Col  Earl Hancock  Pete  Ellis  foresaw a war in the Pacific with Japan and took preparations for such a conflict  Through 1941  as the prospect of war grew  the Corps pushed urgently for joint amphibious exercises and acquired amphibious equipment that would prove of great use in the upcoming conflict  42   edit  World War II Photograph of the USMC War Memorial  which depicts the flag raising on Iwo Jima  The memorial is modeled on Joe Rosenthal s famous Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima  In World War II  the Marines played a central role in the Pacific War  The battles of Guadalcanal  Bougainville  Tarawa  Guam  Tinian  Saipan  Peleliu  Iwo Jima  and Okinawa saw fierce fighting between Marines and the Imperial Japanese Army  Philip Johnston proposed the use of Navajo as a code language to the Corps  The idea was accepted  and the Navajo code was formally developed and modeled on the Joint Army Navy Phonetic Alphabet  During the battle of Iwo Jima  photographer Joe Rosenthal took the famous photograph Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima of five Marines and one Navy Corpsman raising the American flag on Mt  Suribachi  Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal  having come ashore earlier that day  said of the flag raising      the raising of that flag on Suribachi means a Marine Corps for the next five hundred years   The acts of the Marines during the war added to their already significant popular reputation  By the end of the war  the Corps expanded from two brigades to six divisions  five air wings  and supporting troops  totaling about 485 000 Marines  In addition  20 defense battalions and a parachute battalion were set raised  43  Nearly 87 000 Marines were casualties during World War II  including nearly 20 000 killed   and 82 were awarded the Medal of Honor  44  Despite Secretary Forrestal s prediction  the Corps faced an immediate institutional crisis following the war due to the low budget  Army generals pushing for a strengthened and reorganized defense establishment attempted to fold the Marine mission and assets into the Navy and Army  Drawing on hastily assembled Congressional support  and with the assistance of the so called  Revolt of the Admirals  the Marine Corps rebuffed such efforts to dismantle the Corps  resulting in statutory protection of the Marine Corps in the National Security Act of 1947  45  Shortly afterward  in 1952 the Douglas Mansfield Bill afforded the Commandant an equal voice with the Joint Chiefs of Staff on matters relating to the Marines and established the structure of three active divisions and air wings that remain today   edit  Korean War Marine lieutenant Baldomero Lopez scaling the seawall at Inchon  September 1950 The Korean War  1950 1953  saw the hastily formed Provisional Marine Brigade holding the defensive line at the Pusan Perimeter  To execute a flanking maneuver  General Douglas MacArthur called on Marine air and ground forces to make an amphibious landing at Inchon  The successful landing resulted in the collapse of North Korean lines and the pursuit of North Korean forces north near the Yalu River until the entrance of the People s Republic of China into the war  Chinese troops surrounded  surprised and overwhelmed the overextended and outnumbered American forces  X Corps  which included the 1st Marine Division and the Army s 7th Infantry Division  regrouped and inflicted heavy casualties during their fighting withdrawal to the coast  now known as the Battle of Chosin Reservoir  The fighting calmed after the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir  but late in March 1953 the relative quiet of the war was broken when the Chinese Army launched a massive offensive on three outposts manned by the 5th Marine Regiment  These outposts were codenamed  Reno    Vegas   and  Carson   The campaign was collectively known as the Nevada Cities Campaign  There was brutal fighting on Reno hill  which was eventually captured by the Chinese  Although Reno was lost  the 5th Marines held both Vegas and Carson through the rest of the campaign  In this one campaign  the marines suffered approximately 1 000 casualties  while the Chinese suffered at least twice as many  Marines would continue a battle of attrition around the 38th Parallel until the 1953 armistice  46  The Korean War saw the Corps expand from 75 000 regulars to a force of 261 000 Marines  mostly reservists  30 544 Marines were killed or wounded during the war and 42 were awarded the Medal of Honor  47   edit  Vietnam War Operation Hastings  Marines on patrol near Cam Lo  1966 The Marine Corps served an important role in the Vietnam War taking part in such battles as Da Nang  Hue City  Con Thien and Khe Sanh  Individuals from the USMC operated in the Northern I Corps Regions of South Vietnam  While there  they were constantly engaged in a guerrilla war against the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam  NLF  and an intermittent conventional war against the North Vietnamese Army  NVA   Portions of the Corps were responsible for the less known Combined Action Program  CAP  that implemented unconventional techniques for counter insurgency and worked as military advisors to the Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps  Marines were withdrawn in 1971  and returned briefly in 1975 to evacuate Saigon and attempt a rescue of the crew of the Mayag ez  48  Vietnam was the longest war for Marines  by its end  13 091 49  50  had been killed in action  51 392 had been wounded  and 57 Medals of Honor had been awarded  51  52  Due to policies concerning rotation  more Marines were deployed for service during Vietnam than World War II  53  While recovering from Vietnam  the Corps hit a detrimental low point in its service history caused by courts martial and non judicial punishments related partially to increased unauthorized absences and desertions during the war  Overhauling of the Corps began in the late 1970s  discharging the most delinquent  and once quality of new recruits improved  the Corps focused on reforming the NCO Corps  a vital functioning part of its forces  11   edit  Interim  Vietnam to the War on Terror After Vietnam  the Marines resumed their expeditionary role  participating in the 1980 Iran hostage rescue attempt Operation Eagle Claw  the invasion of Grenada  Operation Urgent Fury  and the invasion of Panama  Operation Just Cause   On 23 October 1983  the Marine headquarters building in Beirut  Lebanon  was bombed  causing the highest peacetime losses to the Corps in its history  220 Marines and 21 other service members were killed  and leading to the American withdrawal from the country  The year of 1990 saw Marines of the Joint Task Force Sharp Edge save thousands of lives by evacuating British  French and American nationals from the violence of the Liberian Civil War  During the Persian Gulf War  1990 1991   Marine task forces formed the initial core for Operation Desert Shield  while United States and Coalition troops mobilized  and later liberated Kuwait in Operation Desert Storm  34  Marines participated in combat operations in Somalia  1992 1995  during Operations Restore Hope  Restore Hope II  and United Shield to provide humanitarian relief  54   edit  War on Terror Marines from 1st Battalion 7th Marines enter a palace in Baghdad  Following the attacks on 11 September 2001  President George W  Bush announced the War on Terrorism  The stated objective of the Global War on Terror is  the defeat of Al Qaeda  other terrorist groups and any nation that supports or harbors terrorists   55  Since then  the Marine Corps  alongside other military and federal agencies  has engaged in global operations around the world in support of that mission  In spring 2009  President Barack Obama s goal of reducing spending in the Defense Department was led by Secretary Robert Gates in a series of budget cuts which did not result in significant changes in the Corps  budget and programs  cutting only the VH 71 Kestrel and resetting the VXX program  56  57  58  However  the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform singled the Corps out for the brunt of a series of recommended cuts in late 2010  59   edit  Operation Enduring Freedom Marines conducting a dawn patrol in Nawa District  in Helmand Province  Afghanistan  Marines and other American forces began staging in Pakistan and Uzbekistan on the border of Afghanistan as early as October 2001 in preparation for Operation Enduring Freedom  60  The 15th and 26th Marine Expeditionary Units were the first conventional forces into Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in November 2001  and in December  the Marines seized Kandahar International Airport  61  Since then  Marine battalions and squadrons have been rotating through  engaging Taliban and Al Qaeda forces  Marines of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit flooded into the Taliban held town of Garmsir on April 29  2008  in Helmand Province  in the first major American operation in the region in years  62  In June 2009  7 000 Marines with the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade deployed to Afghanistan in an effort to improve security  63  and began Operation Strike of the Sword the next month  In 2002  Combined Joint Task Force   Horn of Africa was stood up at Camp Lemonnier  Djibouti to provide regional security  64  Despite transferring overall command to the Navy in 2006  the Marines continued to operate in the Horn of Africa into 2007  65   edit  Operation Iraqi Freedom Most recently  the Marines have served prominently in the Iraq War  The I Marine Expeditionary Force  along with the Army s 3rd Infantry Division  spearheaded the 2003 invasion of Iraq  66  The Marines left Iraq in the summer of 2003  but returned for occupation duty in the beginning of 2004  They were given responsibility for the Al Anbar Province  the large desert region to the west of Baghdad  During this occupation  the Marines spearheaded both assaults on the city of Fallujah in April  Operation Vigilant Resolve  and November 2004  Operation Phantom Fury  and saw intense fighting in such places as Ramadi  Al Qa im and H t  67  Their time in Iraq has courted controversy with the Haditha killings and the Hamdania incident  60  68  The Anbar Awakening and 2007 surge reduced levels of violence  On March 1  2009  President Obama announced an accelerated withdrawal at Camp Lejeune  promising all troops out by August 2010  69  The Marine Corps officially ended its role in Iraq on January 23  2010 when they handed over responsibility for Al Anbar Province to the United States Army  69  70   edit  Organization Main article  Organization of the United States Marine Corps The Department of the Navy  led by the Secretary of the Navy  is the Federal Government Agency which both the Marine Corps and the Navy are organized within  The most senior Marine officer is the Commandant of the Marine Corps  responsible to the Secretary of the Navy for organizing  recruiting  training  and equipping the Marine Corps so that its forces are ready for deployment under the operational command of the Combatant Commanders  The Marine Corps is organized into four principal subdivisions  Headquarters Marine Corps  HQMC   the Operating Forces  the Supporting Establishment  and the Marine Forces Reserve  MARFORRES or USMCR   The Operating Forces are further subdivided into three categories  Marine Corps Forces  MARFOR  assigned to unified commands  Marine Corps Security Forces guarding high risk naval installations  and Marine Corps Security Guard detachments at American embassies  Under the  Forces for Unified Commands  memo  in accordance with the Unified Command Plan approved by the President  Marine Corps Forces are assigned to each of the Combatant Commands at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense  Since 1991  the Marine Corps has maintained component headquarters at each of the regional unified combatant commands  71  Marine Corps Forces are further divided into Marine Forces Command  MARFORCOM  and Marine Forces Pacific  MARFORPAC   each headed by a Lieutenant General  MARFORCOM has operational control of the II Marine Expeditionary Force  MARFORPAC has operational control of the I Marine Expeditionary Force and III Marine Expeditionary Force  28  The Supporting Establishment includes Marine Corps Combat Development Command  MCCDC   Marine Corps Recruit Depots  Marine Corps Logistics Command  Marine bases and air stations  Recruiting Command  and the Marine Band   edit  Relationship with other services In general  the Marine Corps shares many resources with the other branches of the United States military  However  the Corps has consistently sought to maintain its own identity with regards to mission  funding  and assets  while utilizing the support available from the larger branches  While the Marine Corps has far fewer installations both in the U S  and worldwide than the other branches  many Army posts  Naval stations  and Air Force bases have a Marine presence   edit  United States Army Main article  United States Army A soldier from the 1st Infantry Regiment provides security for a joint Army Marine patrol in Rawa in 2006  note the logo of the 2nd Marine Division on his shoulder sleeve insignia  The Marine Corps combat capabilities in some ways overlap those of the United States Army  the latter having historically viewed the Corps as encroaching on the Army s capabilities and competing for funding  missions  and renown  The attitude dates back to the founding of the Continental Marines  when General George Washington refused to allow the initial Marine battalions to be drawn from among his Continental Army  Most significantly  in the aftermath of World War II  Army efforts to restructure the American defense establishment included the dissolution of the Corps and the folding of its capabilities into the other services  Leading this movement were such prominent Army officers as General Dwight D  Eisenhower and Army Chief of Staff George C  Marshall  45  With most of the 2000s spent in operations in Afghanistan and Iraq  Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has voiced concerns that the Marines are becoming a  second Army   26  Doctrinally  Marine Corps  focus is on being expeditionary and independent  and places emphasis on amphibious mobility and combined arms  these make it a much lighter force than many units of the Army  A larger percentage of the Marine Corps  personnel and assets are in the combat arms  infantry  artillery  armor  and close air support  than the Army  However  the Army maintains much larger and diverse combat arms  infantry

in World War II  enjoys high prestige to this day  While the Army has a longer continuous tradition of special operations forces  Marines joined the Special Operations Command with the establishment of MCSOCOM Detachment One in 2003  72  The Marines often leverage the Army s acquisition of ground equipment  as well as benefiting from Army research and development resources   training resources  and other support concepts  The majority of vehicles and weapons are shared with  modified  or inherited from Army programs  Culturally  Marines and soldiers share most of the common U S  military slang and terminology  but the Corps utilizes a large number of naval terms and traditions incompatible with the Army lifestyle  as well as their own unique vernacular  Many Marines regard their culture to have a deeper warrior tradition  with the ethos that every Marine is a rifleman and emphasis on cross training and combat readiness despite actual job  be it infantry or otherwise  One

a close relationship  more so than with other branches of the military  Whitepapers and promotional literature have commonly used the phrase  Navy Marine Corps Team   74  75  or refer to  the Naval Service   Both the Chief of Naval Operations  CNO  and Commandant of the Marine Corps report directly to the Secretary of the Navy  Cooperation between the two services really begins with the training and instruction of Marines  The Corps receives a significant portion of its officers from the United States Naval Academy and Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps  NROTC   NROTC staff includes Marine instructors  while Marine drill instructors contribute to training of officers in the Navy s Officer Candidate School  Marine aviators are trained in the Naval Aviation training pipeline and are winged as Naval Aviators  Marine and sailor train with rifles in Djibouti Training alongside each other is viewed as critical  as the Navy provides transport  logistical  and combat support to put Marine units into the fight  for example  the Maritime Prepositioning ships and naval gunfire support  Most Marine aviation assets ultimately derive from the Navy  with regard to acquisition  funding  and testing  and Navy aircraft carriers typically deploy with a Marine squadron alongside Navy squadrons  Marines do not recruit or train noncombatants such as chaplains or medical dental personnel  naval personnel fill these roles  Some of these sailors  particularly Hospital Corpsmen and Religious Programs Specialists  generally wear Marine uniforms emblazoned with Navy insignia  Conversely  the Marine Corps is responsible for conducting land operations to support naval campaigns  including the seizure of naval and air bases  Both services operate a network security team in conjunction  Marines and Sailors share many naval traditions  especially terminology and customs  Marine Corps Medal of Honor recipients wear the Navy variant of this and other awards  22  and with few exceptions  the awards and badges of the Navy and Marine Corps are identical  Much of testing for new Marine Corps aircraft is done at NAS Patuxent River  The Navy s Blue Angels flight demonstration team is staffed by both Navy and Marine officers and enlisted men  and includes a Marine C 130 Hercules aircraft  22  In 2007  the Marine Corps joined with the Navy and Coast Guard to adopt a new maritime strategy called A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower that raises the notion of prevention of war to the same philosophical level as the conduct of war  76  This new strategy charts a course for the Navy  Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent regional crises  man made or natural  from occurring or reacting quickly

 Air ground task forces Main article  Marine Air Ground Task Force Today  the basic framework for deployable Marine units is the Marine Air Ground Task Force  MAGTF   a flexible structure of varying size  A MAGTF integrates a ground combat element  GCE   an aviation combat element  ACE   and a logistics combat element  LCE  81  under a common command element  CE   capable of operating independently or as part of a larger coalition  The MAGTF structure reflects a strong tradition in the Corps towards self sufficiency and a commitment to combined arms  both essential assets to an expeditionary force often called upon to act independently in discrete  time sensitive situations  The history of the Marine Corps as well has led to a wariness of overreliance on its sister services  and towards joint operations in general  11  A MAGTF varies in size from the smallest  a Marine Expeditionary Unit  MEU   based around a reinforced infantry battalion and a composite squadron  up to the largest  a Marine Expeditionary Force  MEF   which ties together a Division  an Air Wing  and a Logistics Group under a MEF Headquarters Group  The seven MEUs constantly rotate between themselves and their attached components to maintain a high state of readiness  Each MEU is rated as capable of performing special operations  82  The three MEFs contain the vast majority of active duty deployable forces   edit  Special warfare Main article  United States Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command See also  United States Marine Corps Special Operations Capable Forces Although the notion of a Marine special forces contribution to the United States Special Operations Command  USSOCOM  was considered as early as the founding of USSOCOM in the 1980s  it was resisted by the Marine Corps  Then Commandant Paul X  Kelley expressed the popular belief that Marines should support Marines  and that the Corps should not fund a special warfare capability that would not support Marine operations  83  However  much of the resistance from within the Corps dissipated when Marine leaders watched the Corps  15th and 26th MEU SOC s  sit on the sidelines  during the very early stages of Operation Enduring Freedom while other special operations units actively engaged in operations in Afghanistan  72  After a three year development period  the Corps agreed in 2006 to supply a 2 500 strong unit  Marine Forces Special Operations Command  MARSOC   which would answer directly to USSOCOM  84   edit  Budget The Marine Corps accounts for around six percent of the military budget of the United States  The cost per Marine is  20 000 less than the cost of a serviceman from the other services  and the entire force can be used for both hybrid and major combat operations  85  enabling it to carry out full scale military action  peacekeeping operations and humanitarian aid   the entire Three Block War  Note that these per capita costs do not account for support provided by the Navy and other branches  such as the Navy s amphibious warfare ships and long range air transport by the USAF  86  However given expected defense budget cuts  the Marines are well positioned for  fielding cheap options for an uncertain world   87  The Marine Corps budget is comparably well handled with a tiny fraction of the Anti Deficiency Act violations of any of the other three major branches  88

Base Quantico  Virginia  At TBS  second lieutenants  warrant officers  and selected foreign officers learn the art of infantry and combined arms warfare  18  Enlisted Marines attend recruit training  known as boot camp  at either Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego or Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island  Historically  the Mississippi River served as the dividing line which delineated who would be trained where  while more recently  a district system has ensured a more even distribution of male recruits between the two MCRD facilities  Females attend only the Parris Island depot as part of the segregated Fourth Recruit Training Battalion  All recruits must pass a fitness test to start training  those who fail receive individualized attention and training until the minimum standards are reached  Marine recruit training is the longest among the American military services  it is 12 weeks long  compared to the Army s 10 weeks or the Navy s 9 weeks  101  Following recruit

Marine Corps has the most stable and most recognizable uniforms in the American military  the Blue Dress dates back to the early 19th century 28  and the service uniform to the early 20th century  Marines  uniforms are distinct in their simplicity  Marines do not wear unit patches or United States flags on any of their uniforms  nor name tags on their service and formal uniforms  Only a handful of skills  parachutist  air crew  explosive ordnance disposal  etc   warrant distinguishing badges  and rank insignia is not worn on uniform headgear  with the exception of an officer s garrison service cover   While other servicemembers commonly identify with a sub group as much as or more than their service  Ranger  submariner  aircrew  etc    Marine uniforms do not reflect such division  Marines have three main uniforms  Dress  Service  and Utility  The Marine Corps Dress uniform is the most elaborate  worn for formal or ceremonial occasions  There are three different forms of the Dress uniform  the most common being the Blue Dress Uniform  called  Dress Blues  or simply  Blues   It is most often seen in recruiting advertisements and is equivalent to black tie  There is a  Blue White  Dress for summer  and Evening Dress for formal  white tie  occasions  Versions with a khaki shirt in lieu of the coat are worn as a daily working uniform by Marine recruiters  103  The Service Uniform was once the prescribed daily work attire in garrison  however  it has been largely superseded in this role by the utility uniform  Consisting of olive green and khaki colors  it is commonly referred to as  Greens   It is roughly equivalent in function and composition to a business suit  103  The Utility Uniform  currently the Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform  is a camouflage uniform intended for wear in the field or for dirty work in garrison  though it has now been standardized for regular duty  It is rendered in a distinctive MARPAT pixelated camouflage  sometimes referred to as digitals or digies  that breaks up the wearer s shape  and serves to distinguish Marine uniforms from those of other services  In garrison  the woodland uniform is worn in winter  and the desert uniform is worn in summer  104  Marines consider the utilities a working uniform and do not permit their wear off base  except in transit to and from their place of duty and in the event of an emergency  This  too  distinguishes them from other services  which have less stringent restrictions  103   edit  Culture Main article  Culture of the United States Marine Corps As in any military organization  the official and unofficial traditions of the Marine Corps serve to reinforce camaraderie and set the service apart from others  The Corps  embrace of its rich culture and history is

Veteran Marine  or  Prior service Marine  can refer to anyone who has been discharged from the Corps   Retired Marine  refers to those who have completed 20 or more years of service and formally retired  or have been medically retired   Former Marine  is considered acceptable among those who are honorably discharged from the United States Marine Corps   Sir  or  Ma am  is appropriate out of respect  According to one of the  Commandant s White letters  from Commandant Alfred M  Gray  Jr   referring to a Marine by their last earned rank is appropriate  118  Marines that have left service with a less than full honorable discharge might still be considered Marines  depending on the view of the individual   however that title is in keeping with a stigma  and many will avoid the issue altogether by addressing the individual by name with no other title  Marine performs a shoulder throw   edit  Martial arts program Main article  Marine Corps Martial Arts Program In 2001  the Marine Corps initiated an internally designed martial arts program  called Marine Corps Martial Arts Program  MCMAP   Due to an expectation that urban and police type peacekeeping missions would become more common in the 21st century  placing Marines in even closer contact with unarmed civilians  MCMAP was implemented to provide Marines with a larger and more versatile set of less than lethal options for controlling hostile  but unarmed individuals  It is a stated aim of the program to instill and maintain the  Warrior Ethos  within Marines  119  The Marine Corps Martial Arts program is an eclectic mix of different styles of martial arts melded together  MCMAP consists of open palm punches and kicks from Taekwondo and Karate  opponent weight transfer from Jujitsu  ground grappling involving joint locking techniques and chokes from Brazilian Jiu Jitsu  and a mix of knife and baton stick fighting derived from Eskrima  and elbow strikes and kick boxing from Muay Thai  Marines begin MCMAP

DMR  being replaced by the M39 EMR   and the SAM R  123  The Marine Corps utilizes a variety of direct fire rockets and missiles to provide infantry with an offensive and defensive anti armor capability  The SMAW and AT4 are unguided rockets that can destroy armor and fixed defenses  e g   bunkers  at ranges up to 500 meters  The smaller and lighter M72 LAW can destroy targets at ranges up to 200 meters  124  125  The Predator SRAW  FGM 148 Javelin and BGM 71 TOW are anti tank guided missiles  The Javelin can utilize top attack profiles to avoid heavy frontal armor  The Predator is a short range fire and forget weapon  the Javelin and TOW are heavier missiles effective past 2 000 meters that give infantry an offensive capability against armor  126  The USMC is currently seeking to purchase commercial off the shelf bullet trap or shoot through rifle grenades  127  These grenades will provide individual Marines additional firepower and will allow indirect fire against targets in
