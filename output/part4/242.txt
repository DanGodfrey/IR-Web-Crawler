President Manhattan   m n h t n   is the oldest and the most densely populated of the five boroughs of New York City  Located primarily on the island of Manhattan at the mouth of the Hudson River  the boundaries of the borough are identical to those of New York County  an original county of the state of New York  The borough and county consist of Manhattan Island and several small adjacent islands  Roosevelt Island  Randall s Island  Wards Island  Governors Island  Liberty Island  part of Ellis Island  1 Mill Rock  and U Thant Island  as well as Marble Hill  a very small area on the mainland bordering the Bronx  The original city of New York began at the southern end of Manhattan  expanded northwards  and then between 1874 and 1898  annexed land from surrounding counties  The County of New York is the most densely populated county in the United States  and one of the most densely populated areas in the world  with a 2010 population of 1 585 873  2  living in a land area of 22 96 square miles  59 5 km2   or 69 464 residents per square mile  26 924 km    It is also one of the wealthiest counties in the United States  with a 2005 per capita income above  100 000  3  Manhattan is the third largest of New York s five boroughs in population  and its smallest borough in land area  Manhattan is a major commercial  financial  and cultural center of both the United States and the world  4  5  6  Anchored by Wall Street in Lower Manhattan  New York City vies with the City of London as the financial capital of the world 7  8  9  10  11  12  13  and is home of both the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ  Many major radio  television  and telecommunications companies in the United States are based here  as well as many news  magazine  book  and other media publishers  Manhattan has many famous landmarks  tourist attractions  museums  and universities  It is also the location of the United Nations Headquarters  It is the center of New York City and the New York metropolitan region  hosting the seat of city government and a large portion of the area s employment  business  and entertainment activities  As a result  residents of New York City s other boroughs such as Brooklyn and Queens often refer to a trip to Manhattan as  going to the city   14  despite the comparable populations between those boroughs  New York s five boroughs overview Jurisdiction

the 1609 logbook of Robert Juet  an officer on Henry Hudson s yacht Halve Maen  Half Moon   18  A 1610 map depicts the name as Manna hata  twice  on both the west and east sides of the Mauritius River  later named the Hudson River   The word  Manhattan  has been translated as  island of many hills  from the Lenape language  19  New York County is one of seven US counties to bear the same name as the state in which it lies  the others are Arkansas County  Hawaii County  Idaho County  Iowa County  Oklahoma County  and Utah County    edit  History Main article  History of New York City  edit  Colonial era The area that is now Manhattan was long inhabited by the Lenape Indians  In 1524  Florentine explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano   sailing in service of the French king Francis I   was the first European to visit the area that would become New York City  He entered The Narrows aboard his ship La Dauphine and named the land around Upper New York Harbor  Angouleme   the family name of Francis I  he sailed far enough into the harbor to sight the Hudson River which he referred to in his report to the French king as a  Very Big River   and he named Upper New York Bay the Bay of Santa Margarita   after Marguerite de Navarre   the elder sister of the king  20  21  It was not until the voyage of Henry Hudson  an Englishman who worked for the Dutch East India Company  that the area was mapped  22  Hudson came across Manhattan Island and the native people living there in 1609  and continued up the river that would later bear his name  the Hudson River  until he arrived at the site of present day Albany  23  Peter Minuit The Castello Plan showing the Dutch colonial city of New Amsterdam in 1660   then confined to the southern tip of Manhattan Island  A permanent European presence in New Netherland began in 1624 with the founding of a Dutch fur trading settlement on Governors Island  In 1625 construction was started on a citadel and a Fort Amsterdam on Manhattan Island  later called New Amsterdam  Nieuw Amsterdam   24  25  Manhattan Island was chosen as the site of Fort Amsterdam  a citadel for the protection of the new arrivals  its 1625 establishment is recognized as the birth date of New York City  26  According to the document by Pieter Janszoon Schagen our people  ons Volck  Peter Minuit is not mentioned explicitly there acquired Manhattan in 1626 from Native American Lenape people in exchange for trade goods worth 60 guilders  often said to be worth 24 US   though  by comparing the price of bread and other goods  actually amounts to around  1000 in modern currency 27   calculation by the International Institute of Social History  Amsterdam   The price was actually paid to the Canarsees  living in Brooklyn  while the true local people  the Weckquaesgeeks  were not party of the transaction  28  In 1647  Peter Stuyvesant was appointed as the last Dutch Director General of the colony  29  New Amsterdam was formally incorporated as a city on February 2  1653  30  In 1664  the English conquered New Netherland and renamed it  New York  after the English Duke of York and Albany  the future King James II  31  Stuyvesant and his council negotiated with the English to produce 24 articles of provisional transfer that sought to guarantee New Netherlanders liberties  including freedom of religion  under English rule  32  33  The Dutch Republic regained it in August 1673 with a fleet of 21 ships  renaming the city  New Orange   New Netherland was ceded permanently to the English in November 1674 through the Treaty of Westminster  34   edit  American Revolution and the early United States J Q A  Ward s statue of George Washington in front of Federal Hall  on the site where Washington was inaugurated as the first U S  President  A prelude to organized colonial opposition to British rule  the Stamp Act Congress of representatives from across the Thirteen Colonies was held in New York City in 1765  The Congress resulted in the Declaration of Rights and Grievances  the first document by a representative body of multiple colonies to assert the concept popularly known as  no taxation without representation   It was also the first time the colonies cooperated for a unified political aim  and laid the foundation for the Continental Congresses that followed years later  The Sons of Liberty developed on Manhattan in the days following the Stamp Act protests  The organization participated in a long term confrontation with British authorities over liberty poles that were alternately raised by the Sons of Liberty and cut down by British authorities  The skirmishes ended when the revolutionary New York Provincial Congress took power in 1775  Manhattan was at the heart of the New York Campaign  a series of major battles in the early American Revolutionary War  The Continental Army was forced to abandon Manhattan after the disastrous Battle of Fort Washington on November 16  1776  The city became the British political and military center of operations in North America for the remainder of the war  35  Manhattan was greatly damaged by the Great Fire of New York during the British military rule that followed  British occupation lasted until November 25  1783  when George Washington returned to Manhattan  as the last British forces left the city  36  From January 11  1785 to the fall of 1788  New York City was the fifth of five capitals under the Articles of Confederation  with the Continental Congress meeting at New York City Hall  then at Fraunces Tavern   New York was the first capital under the newly enacted Constitution of the United States  from March 4  1789 to August 12  1790 at Federal Hall  37  The United States Supreme Court sat for the first time  the United States Bill of Rights were drafted and ratified  and the first steps of adding states to the Union with the passage of the Northwest Ordinance all took place there   edit  19th century growth New York grew as an economic center  first as a result of Alexander Hamilton s policies and practices as the first Secretary of the Treasury and  later  with the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825  which connected the Atlantic port to the vast agricultural markets of the Midwestern United States and Canada  Tammany Hall  a Democratic Party political machine  began to grow in influence with the support of many of the immigrant Irish  culminating in the election of the first Tammany mayor  Fernando Wood  in 1854  Tammany Hall dominated local politics for decades  Central Park  which opened to the public in 1858  became the first landscaped park in an American city and the nation s first public park  38  39  Thomas Nast denounces Tammany as a ferocious tiger killing democracy  the tiger image caught on  Bird s eye panorama of Manhattan  amp  New York City in 1873 During the American Civil War  the city s strong commercial ties to the South  its growing immigrant population  prior to then largely from Germany and Ireland   anger about conscription and resentment at those who could afford to pay  300 to avoid service  led to resentment against Lincoln s war policies  culminating in the three day long New York Draft Riots of July 1863  one of the worst incidents of civil disorder in American history  with an estimated 119 participants and passersby massacred  40  The rate of immigration from Europe grew steeply after the Civil War  and New York became the first stop for millions seeking a new and better life in the United States  a role acknowledged by the dedication of the Statue of Liberty on October 28  1886  a gift from the people of France  41  42  The new European immigration brought further social upheaval  In a city of tenements packed with poorly paid laborers from dozens of nations  the city was a hotbed of revolution  syndicalism  racketeering  and unionization  In 1883  the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge established a surface connection across the East River  In 1874  the western portion of the present Bronx County was transferred to New York County  and in 1895 the remainder of the present Bronx County was annexed  43  The City of Greater New York was formed in 1898  when four counties consolidated to form a single city of five boroughs  Manhattan and the Bronx  though still one county  were established as two separate boroughs  On January 1  1914  the New York state legislature created Bronx County  and New York County was reduced to its present boundaries  44   edit  The 20th century The newly completed Singer Building towering above the city  1909 A construction worker on

Liberty  the Empire State Building  and the World Trade Center  May 2001  The construction of the New York City Subway  which opened in 1904  helped bind the new city together  as did additional bridges to Brooklyn  In the 1920s  Manhattan experienced large arrivals of African Americans as part of the Great Migration from the American South  and the Harlem Renaissance  part of a larger boom time in the Prohibition era that included new skyscrapers competing for the skyline  New York City became the most populous city in the world in 1925  overtaking London  which had reigned for a century  45  On March 25  1911  the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in Greenwich Village killed 146 garment workers  The disaster eventually led to overhauls of the city s fire department  building codes  and workplace regulations  46  The period between the World Wars saw the election of reformist mayor Fiorello La Guardia and the fall of Tammany Hall after 80 years of political dominance  47  As the city s demographics stabilized  labor unionization brought new protections and affluence to the working class  the city s government and infrastructure underwent a dramatic overhaul under La Guardia  Despite the Great Depression  some of the world s tallest skyscrapers were completed in Manhattan during the 1930s  including numerous Art Deco masterpieces that are still part of the city s skyline today  most notably the Empire State Building  the Chrysler Building  and the GE Building  Returning World War II veterans created a postwar economic boom  which led to the development of huge housing developments targeted at returning veterans  including Peter Cooper Village Stuyvesant Town  which opened in 1947  48  In 1951  the UN relocated from its first headquarters in Queens  to the East Side of Manhattan  49  Like many major U S  cities  New York suffered race riots and population and industrial decline in the 1960s  By the 1970s  the city had gained a reputation as a graffiti covered  crime ridden relic of history  50  In 1975  the city government faced imminent bankruptcy  and its appeals for assistance were initially rejected  summarized by the classic October 30  1975 New York Daily News headline as  Ford to City  Drop Dead   51  The fate was avoided through a federal loan and debt restructuring  and the city was forced to accept increased financial scrutiny by New York State  52  The 1980s saw a rebirth of Wall Street  and the city reclaimed its role at the center of the worldwide financial industry  The 1980s also saw Manhattan at the heart of the AIDS crisis  with Greenwich Village at its epicenter  Gay Men s Health Crisis  GMHC  and AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power  ACT UP  were founded to advocate on behalf of those stricken with the disease  Starting in the 1990s  crime rates dropped drastically  with murder rates that had reached 2 245 in 1990 plummeting to 537 by 2008  and the crack epidemic and its associated drug related violence under greater control  53  The outflow of population turned around  as the city once again became the destination of immigrants from around the world  joining with low interest rates and Wall Street bonuses to fuel the growth of the real estate market  54   edit  September 11 attacks Main article  September 11 attacks See also  One World Trade Center  World Trade Center rebuilding controversy   and Health effects arising from the September 11 attacks On September 11  2001  two of four hijacked planes were flown into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center  The towers collapsed  resulting in the eventual collapse of World Trade Center 7 due to fire damage  citation needed  The other buildings of the World Trade Center complex were damaged beyond repair and soon after demolished  The collapse of the Twin Towers caused extensive damage to surrounding buildings and skyscrapers in Lower Manhattan  and resulted in the deaths of 2 606 people  plus those on the planes  Since September 11  most of Lower Manhattan has been restored  many rescue workers and residents of the area have developed several life threatening illnesses  and some have already died  55  A memorial at the site was opened to the public on September 11  2011  A museum is currently under construction at the memorial and scheduled to open in September 2012  One World Trade Center  formerly known as the Freedom Tower  is also under construction  as well as the other planned buildings on the site   edit  Television and Film in NYC Modern New York City is familiar to many people around the globe thanks to its popularity as a setting for films and television series  Notable television examples of shows set in Manhattan include such award winning shows and franchises as White Collar  30 Rock  I Love Lucy  Friends  Gossip Girl  The Jeffersons  How I Met Your Mother  The Law  amp  Order series  most spin offs included   Mad About You  NYPD Blue  The Odd Couple  Saturday Night Live  Seinfeld  Sex and the City  Spin City  Sports Night  Ugly Betty  Flight of the Conchords    Cagney  amp  Lacey    and Will  amp  Grace  Notable examples of films set in Manhattan include Miracle on 34th Street  The Godfather  Wall Street  You ve Got Mail  Ghostbusters  The In Laws  Little Manhattan  and many of Woody Allen s films  such as Annie Hall  Bananas  and Manhattan  The city was also the backdrop and location for numerous crime and drama films in the 1940s and 1950s  See more comprehensive lists of films and television shows set in New York City   edit  Geography See also  Geography and environment of New York City Central Park is visible in the center of this satellite image  Manhattan is bound by the Hudson River to the west  the Harlem River to the north  and East River to the east  Manhattan is loosely divided into Downtown  Midtown  and Uptown  with Fifth Avenue dividing Manhattan s east and west sides  Manhattan Island is bounded by the Hudson River to the west and the East River to the east  To the north  the Harlem River divides Manhattan Island from The Bronx and the mainland United States  Several small islands are also part of the borough of Manhattan  including Randall s Island  Wards Island  and Roosevelt Island in the East River  and Governors Island and Liberty Island to the south in New York Harbor  56  Manhattan Island is 22 7 square miles  59 km2  in area  13 4 miles  21 6 km  long and 2 3 miles  3 7 km  wide  at its widest  near 14th Street   57  New York County as a whole covers a total area of 33 77 square miles  87 5 km2   of which 22 96 square miles  59 5 km2  are land and 10 81 square miles  28 0 km2  are water  58  A modern redrawing of the 1807 version of the Commissioner s Grid plan for Manhattan  a few years before it was adopted in 1811  Central Park is absent  One Manhattan neighborhood is contiguous with The Bronx  Marble Hill at one time was part of Manhattan Island  but the Harlem River Ship Canal  dug in 1895 to improve navigation on the Harlem River  separated it from the remainder of Manhattan as an island between the Bronx and the remainder of Manhattan  59  Before World War I  the section of the original Harlem River channel separating Marble Hill from The Bronx was filled in  and Marble Hill became part of the mainland  60  Marble Hill is one example of how Manhattan s land has been considerably altered by human intervention  The borough has seen substantial land reclamation along its waterfronts since Dutch colonial times  and much of the natural variation in topography has been evened out  19  Early in the 19th century  landfill was used to expand Lower Manhattan from the natural Hudson shoreline at Greenwich Street to West Street  61  When building the World Trade Center  1 2 million cubic yards  917 000 m   of material was excavated from the site  62  Rather than dumping the spoil at sea or in landfills  the fill material was used to expand the Manhattan shoreline across West Street  creating Battery Park City  63  The result was a 700 foot  210 m  extension into the river  running six blocks or 1 484 feet  450 m   covering 92 acres  37 ha   providing a 1 2 mile  1 9 km  riverfront esplanade and over 30 acres  12 ha  of parks  64  Geologically  a predominant feature of the substrata of Manhattan is that the underlying bedrock base of the island rises considerably closer to the surface near the midtown district  dips down lower between 29th street and Canal street  then rises towards the surface again under the Financial district  this feature is the underlying reason for the clustering of skyscrapers in the Midtown and Financial district areas  and their absence over the intervening territory between these two areas  as their foundations can be sunk more securely into solid bedrock  Manhattan has fixed vehicular connections with New Jersey to the west by way of the George Washington Bridge  Holland Tunnel and Lincoln Tunnel  and to three of the four other New York City boroughs the Bronx to the northeast and Brooklyn and Queens on Long Island to the east and south  Its only direct connection with the fifth New York City borough is the Staten Island Ferry across New York Harbor  which is free of charge  The ferry terminal is located near Battery Park at its southern tip  It is possible to travel to Staten Island by way of Brooklyn  using the Verrazano Narrows Bridge  The Commissioners  Plan of 1811  called for twelve numbered avenues running north and south roughly parallel to the shore of the Hudson River  each 100 feet  30 m  wide  with First Avenue on the east side and Twelfth Avenue in the west  There are several intermittent avenues east of First Avenue  including four additional lettered avenues running from Avenue A eastward to Avenue D in an area now known as Alphabet City in Manhattan s East Village  The numbered streets in Manhattan run east west  and are 60 feet  18 m  wide  with about 200 feet  61 m  between each pair of streets  With each combined street and block adding up to about 260 feet  79 m   there are almost exactly 20 blocks per mile  The typical block in Manhattan is 250 by 600 feet  180 m   According to the original Commissioner s Plan there were 155 numbered crosstown streets  65  but later the grid has been extended up to the Northernmost corner of Manhattan  where the last numbered street is 220th Street  Manhattan   Moreover  the numbering system continues even in The Bronx  North of Manhattan  despite the fact that there the grid plan is not so regular  there the last numbered street is 263rd Street  66  Fifteen crosstown streets were designated as 100 feet  30 m  wide  including 34th  42nd  57th and 125th Streets  some of the borough s most significant transportation and shopping venues  67 Broadway is the most notable of many exceptions to the grid  starting at Bowling Green in Lower Manhattan and continuing north into the Bronx at Manhattan s northern tip  In much of Midtown Manhattan  Broadway runs at a diagonal to the grid  creating major named intersections at Union Square  Park Avenue South Fourth Avenue and 14th Street   Madison Square  Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street   Herald Square  Sixth Avenue and 34th Street   Times Square  Seventh Avenue and 42nd Street   and Columbus Circle  Eighth Avenue Central Park West and 59th Street   A consequence of the strict grid plan of most of Manhattan  and the grid s skew of approximately 28 9 degrees  is a phenomenon sometimes referred to as Manhattanhenge  by analogy with Stonehenge   68  On separate occasions in late May and early July  the sunset is aligned with the street grid lines  with the result that the sun is visible at or near the western horizon from street level  68  69  A similar phenomenon occurs with the sunrise in January and December  The Wildlife Conservation Society  which operates the zoos and aquariums in the city  is currently undertaking The Mannahatta Project  a computer simulation to visually reconstruct the ecology and geography of Manhattan when Henry Hudson first sailed by in 1609  and compare it to what we know of the island today  70   edit  Adjacent counties Bergen County

Chinatown has a dense population of people of Chinese descent  79  80 Koreatown is roughly bounded by 5th and 6th Avenues  between 31st and 36th Streets  The Upper West Side is often characterized as more intellectual and creative  in contrast to the old money and conservative values of the Upper East Side  one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the United States  81  82  83  In Manhattan  uptown means north  more precisely north northeast  which is the direction the island and its street grid system is oriented  and downtown means south  south southwest   84  This usage differs from that of most American cities  where downtown refers to the central business district  Manhattan has two central business districts  the Financial District at the southern tip of the island  and Midtown Manhattan  The term uptown also refers to the northern part of Manhattan above 72nd Street and downtown to the southern portion below 14th Street  85  with Midtown covering the area in between  though definitions can be rather fluid depending on the situation  Fifth Avenue roughly bisects Manhattan Island and acts as the demarcation line for east west designations  e g   East 27th Street  West 42nd Street   street addresses start at Fifth Avenue and increase heading away from Fifth Avenue  at a rate of 100 per block in most places  85  South of Waverly Place in Manhattan  Fifth Avenue terminates and Broadway becomes the east west demarcation line  Though the grid does start with 1st Street  just north of Houston Street  pronounced HOW stin   the grid does not fully take hold until north of 14th Street  where nearly all east west streets are numerically identified  which increase from south to north to 220th Street  the highest numbered street on the island  Streets in Midtown are usually one way with a few exceptions  14th  34th and 42nd to name a few   The rule of thumb is odd numbered streets run west while evens run east  57   edit  Climate Rain in Midtown Manhattan Although located at around 41 N  Manhattan has a humid subtropical climate  K ppen classification Cfa   86  The city s coastal position keeps temperatures relatively warmer than those of inland regions during winter  helping to moderate the amount of snow  which averages 25 to 35 inches  63 5 to 88 9 cm  each year  86  New York City has a frost free period lasting an average of 220 days between seasonal freezes  86  Spring and fall in New York City are mild  while summer is very warm and humid  with temperatures of 90  F  32  C  or higher recorded from 18 to 25 days on average during the season  86  The city s long term climate patterns are affected by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation  a 70 year long warming and cooling cycle in the Atlantic that influences the frequency and severity of hurricanes and coastal storms in the region  87  Temperature records have been set as high as 106  F  41  C  on July 9  1936 and as low as  15  F   26  C  on February 9  1934  Temperatures have hit 103  F  39  C  as recently as July 2010 and dropped to just 1 above zero as recently as January 2004  Summer evening temperatures are elevated by the urban heat island effect  which causes heat absorbed during the day to be radiated back at night  raising temperatures by as much as 7  F  4  C  when winds are slow  88  v t e Climate data for New York  Central Park   1981 2010 normals

Five Points in an 1885 sketch An NYPD boat patrols the New York Harbor NYPD Crown Victoria police car Starting in the mid 19th century  the United States became a magnet for immigrants seeking to escape poverty in their home countries  After arriving in New York  many new arrivals ended up living in squalor in the slums of the Five Points neighborhood  an area between Broadway and the Bowery  northeast of New York City Hall  By the 1820s  the area was home to many gambling dens and brothels  and was known as a dangerous place to go  In 1842  Charles Dickens visited the area and was appalled at the horrendous living conditions he had seen  106  The area was so notorious that it even caught the attention of Abraham Lincoln  who visited the area before his Cooper Union Address in 1860  107  The predominantly Irish Five Points Gang was one of the country s first major organized crime entities  As Italian immigration grew in the early 20th century many joined ethnic gangs  including Al Capone  who got his start in crime with the Five Points Gang  108  The Mafia  also known as Cosa Nostra  first developed in the mid 19th century in Sicily and spread to the East Coast of the United States during the late 19th century following waves of Sicilian and Southern Italian emigration  Lucky Luciano established La Cosa Nostra in Manhattan  forming alliances with other criminal enterprises  including the Jewish mob  led by Meyer Lansky  the leading Jewish gangster of that period  109  from 1920 1933  Prohibition helped create a thriving black market in liquor  upon which the Mafia was quick to capitalize  109  New York City experienced a sharp increase in crime during the 1960s and 1970s  with a near fivefold jump in the total number of police recorded crimes  from 21 09

closely associated with New York City s identity since the end of the 19th century  From 1890 1973  the world s tallest building was in Manhattan  with nine different buildings holding the title  131  The New York World Building on Park Row  was the first to take the title in 1890  standing 309 feet  91 m  until 1955  when it was demolished to construct a new ramp to the Brooklyn Bridge  132  The nearby Park Row Building  with its 29 stories standing 391 feet  119 m  high took the title in 1899  133  The 41 story Singer Building  constructed in 1908 as the headquarters of the eponymous sewing machine manufacturer  stood 612 feet  187 m  high until 1967  when it became the tallest building ever demolished  134  The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower  standing 700 feet  213 m  at the foot of Madison Avenue  wrested the title in 1909  with a tower reminiscent of St Mark s Campanile in Venice  135  The Woolworth Building  and its distinctive Gothic architecture  took the title in 1913  topping off at 792 feet  241 m   136  The Chrysler Building  was the tallest building in the city and the world from 1930 1931 The Roaring Twenties saw a race to the sky  with three separate buildings pursuing the world s tallest title in the span of a year  As the stock market soared in the days before the Wall Street Crash of 1929  two developers publicly competed for the crown  137  At 927 feet  282 m   40 Wall Street  completed in May 1930 in an astonishing eleven months as the headquarters of the Bank of Manhattan  seemed to have secured the title  138  At Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street  auto executive Walter Chrysler and his architect William Van Alen developed plans to build the structure s trademark 185 foot  56 m  high spire in secret  pushing the Chrysler Building to 1 046 feet  319 m  and making it the tallest in the world when it was completed in 1929  139  Both buildings were soon surpassed  with the May 1931 completion of the 102 story Empire State Building with its Art Deco tower soaring 1 250 feet  381 m  to the top of the building  The 203 ft  62 m  high pinnacle was later added bringing the total height of the building to 1 453 ft  443 m   140  141

protests were aimed at preserving the McKim  Mead  and White designed structure completed in 1910  widely considered a masterpiece of the Beaux Arts style and one of the architectural jewels of New York City  144  Despite these efforts  demolition of the structure began in October 1963  The loss of Penn Station called  an act of irresponsible public vandalism  by historian Lewis Mumford led directly to the enactment in 1965 of a local law establishing the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission  which is responsible for preserving the  city s historic  aesthetic  and cultural heritage   145  The historic preservation movement triggered by Penn Station s demise has been credited with the retention of some one million structures nationwide  including nearly 1 000 in New York

commuters adding a net 1 34 million people to the population  This commuter influx of 1 61  153  million workers coming into Manhattan was the largest of any other county or city in the country  and was more than triple the 480 000 commuters who headed into second ranked Washington  D C  154  155  Its most important economic sector is the finance industry  whose 280 000 workers earned more than half of all the wages paid in the borough  The securities industry  best known by its center in Wall Street  forms the largest segment of the city s financial sector  accounting for over 50  of the

Metropolitan Museum of Art An aerial shot of the Southern half of Manhattan taken from a plane Manhattan has been the scene of many important American cultural movements  In 1912  about 20 000 workers  a quarter of them women  marched on Washington Square Park to commemorate the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire  which killed 146 workers on March 25  1911  Many of the women wore fitted tucked front blouses like those manufactured by the Triangle Shirtwaist Company  a clothing style that became the working woman s uniform and a symbol of female independence  reflecting the alliance of labor and suffrage movements  165  The Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s established the African American literary canon in the United States  Manhattan s vibrant visual art scene in the 1950s and 1960s was a

some natives of New York City s boroughs outside Manhattan will describe a trip to Manhattan as  going to the city   171  The borough has a place in several American idioms  The phrase a New York minute is meant to convey a very short time  sometimes in hyperbolic form  as in  perhaps faster than you would believe is possible   It refers to the rapid pace of life in Manhattan  172  The term  melting pot  was first popularly coined to describe the densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side in Israel Zangwill s play The Melting Pot  which was an adaptation of William Shakespeare s Romeo and Juliet set by Zangwill in New York City in 1908  173  The iconic Flatiron Building is said to have been the source of the phrase  23 skidoo  or scram  from what cops would shout at men who tried to get glimpses of women s dresses being blown up by the winds created by the triangular building  174  The  Big Apple  dates back to the 1920s  when a reporter heard the term used by New Orleans stablehands to refer to New York City s racetracks and named his racing column  Around The Big Apple   Jazz musicians adopted the term to refer to the city as the world s jazz capital  and a 1970s ad campaign by the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau helped popularize the term  175   edit  Sports Manhattan is home to the NBA s New York Knicks  the NHL s New York

City that does not have a professional baseball franchise  The Bronx has the Yankees  American League  and Queens has the Mets  National League  of Major League Baseball  The Minor League Baseball Brooklyn Cyclones play in Brooklyn  while the Staten Island Yankees play in Staten Island  Yet three of the four major league teams to play in New York City played in Manhattan  The New York Giants played in the various incarnations of the Polo Grounds at 155th Street and Eighth Avenue from their inception in 1883 except for 1889  when they split their time between Jersey City and Staten Island  and when they played in Hilltop Park in 1911 until they headed west with the Brooklyn Dodgers after the 1957 season  176  The New York Yankees began their franchise as the Highlanders  named for Hilltop Park  where they played from their creation in 1903 until 1912  The team moved to the Polo Grounds with the 1913 season  where they were officially christened the New York Yankees  remaining

court  famed for its street ball style of play  where many NBA athletes have played in the summer league  184  Though both of New York City s football teams play today across the Hudson River in Met Life Stadium in East Rutherford  New Jersey  both teams started out playing in the Polo Grounds  The New York Giants played side by side with their baseball namesakes from the time they entered the National Football League in 1925  until crossing over to Yankee Stadium in 1956  185  The New York Jets  originally known as the Titans  started out in 1960 at the Polo Grounds  staying there for four seasons before joining the Mets in Queens in 1964  186  The New York Rangers of the National Hockey League have played in the various locations of Madison Square Garden since their founding in the 1926 1927 season  The Rangers were predated by the New York Americans  who started play in the Garden the previous season  lasting until the team folded after the 1941 1942 NHL season  a season it played in the Garden as the Brooklyn Americans  187  The New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League played their home games at Downing Stadium for two seasons  starting in 1974  In 1975  the

Housing In the early days of Manhattan  wood construction and poor access to water supplies left the city vulnerable to fires  In 1776  shortly after the Continental Army evacuated Manhattan and left it to the British  a massive fire broke out destroying one third of the city and some 500 houses  195  Loft apartments in TriBeCa The rise of immigration near the turn of the 20th century left major portions of Manhattan  especially the Lower East Side  densely packed with recent arrivals  crammed into unhealthy and unsanitary housing  Tenements were usually five stories high  constructed on the then typical 25x100 lots  with  cockroach landlords  exploiting the new immigrants  196  197  By 1929  stricter fire codes and the increased use of elevators in residential buildings  were the impetus behind a new housing code that effectively ended the tenement as a form of new construction  though many tenement buildings survive today on the East Side of the borough  197  Today  Manhattan offers a wide array of public and private housing options  There were 798 144 housing units in Manhattan as of the 2000 Census  at an average density of 34 756 7 per square mile  13 421 8 km    58  Only 20 3  of Manhattan residents lived in owner occupied housing  the second lowest rate of all counties in the nation  behind The Bronx  119  Although the city of New York has the highest average cost for rent in the United States  it simultaneously hosts a higher average of income per capita  Since the higher average of income affects how much rent payers spend percentage wise on rent  NYC is still above the 10 most difficult American cities in which to pay rent   198   edit  Infrastructure  edit  Transportation Grand Central Terminal  a terminal rail station  and a National Historic Landmark  Staten Island Ferry seen from Battery Park  See also  Transportation in New York City Manhattan is unique in the United States of America for intense use of public transportation and lack of private

York City  is directly under Madison Square Garden  The metro region s commuter rail lines converge at Penn Station and Grand Central Terminal  on the west and east sides of Midtown Manhattan  respectively  They are the two busiest rail stations in the United States  About one third of users of mass transit and two thirds of railway passengers in the country live in New York and its suburbs  214 Amtrak provides inter city passenger rail service from Penn Station to Boston  Philadelphia  Baltimore and Washington  D C   Upstate New York  New England  cross border service to Toronto and Montreal  and destinations in the South and Midwest  The Lincoln Tunnel  which carries 120 000 vehicles a day under the Hudson River between New Jersey and Manhattan  is the busiest vehicular tunnel in the world  215  The tunnel was built instead of a bridge to allow unfettered passage of large passenger and cargo ships that sailed through New York Harbor and up the Hudson to Manhattan s piers  The Queens Midtown Tunnel  built to relieve congestion on the bridges connecting Manhattan with Queens and Brooklyn  was the largest non federal project in its time when it was completed in 1940  216

largest clean air diesel hybrid and compressed natural gas bus fleet in the country  It also has some of the first hybrid taxis  most of which operate in Manhattan  220  Crosstown traffic refers primarily to vehicular traffic between Manhattan s East Side and Manhattan s West Side  The trip is notoriously frustrating for drivers because of heavy congestion on narrow local streets laid out by the Commissioners  Plan of 1811  the barrier posed by the Park itself to uptown streets  and absence of express roads other than the Trans Manhattan Expressway at the far north end of Manhattan Island  The only exception are are the four sunken roads that travel through Central Park  Proposals in the mid 1900s to build such roads through the city s densest neighborhoods  namely the Mid Manhattan Expressway and Lower Manhattan Expressway  did not go forward  The congestion makes Manhattan s crosstown buses the perennial  winners  of the  Pokey Awards  for slowest service in New York City   edit  Utilities Gas and electric service is provided by Consolidated Edison to all of Manhattan  Con Edison s electric business traces its roots back to Thomas Edison s Edison Electric Illuminating Company  the first investor owned electric utility  The company started service on September 4  1882  using one generator to provide 110 volts direct current  DC  to 59 customers with 800 light bulbs  in a one square mile area of Lower Manhattan from his Pearl Street Station  221 Con Edison operates the world s largest district steam system  which consists of 105 miles  169 km  of steam pipes

Communications  although AT amp T is available as well  Manhattan  surrounded by two brackish rivers  had a limited supply of fresh water  The supply dwindled as the city grew rapidly after the American Revolutionary War  To satisfy the growing population  the city acquired land in Westchester County and constructed the Croton Aqueduct system  which went into service in 1842  The system took water from a dam at the Croton River  and sent it down through the Bronx  over the Harlem River by way of the High Bridge  to storage reservoirs in Central Park and at 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue  and through a network of cast iron pipes on to consumer s faucets  224  Today  the New York City Department of Environmental Protection provides water to residents fed by a 2 000 square mile  5 200 km2  watershed in the Catskill Mountains  Because the watershed is in one of the largest protected wilderness areas in the United States  the natural water filtration process remains intact  As a result  New York is one of only five major cities in the United States with drinking water pure enough to require only chlorination to ensure its purity at the tap under normal conditions  225  226  Water comes to Manhattan through New York City Water Tunnel No  1 and Tunnel No  2  completed in 1917 and 1936  respectively  Construction started in 1970 continues on New York City Water Tunnel No  3  which will double the system s existing 1 2 billion gallon a day capacity while providing a much needed backup to the two other tunnels  227  The New York City Department of Sanitation is responsible for garbage removal  228  The bulk of the city s trash ultimately is disposed at mega dumps in Pennsylvania  Virginia  South Carolina and Ohio  via transfer stations in New Jersey  Brooklyn and Queens
