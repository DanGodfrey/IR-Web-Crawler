References 9 External links  edit  Biology True Kree resemble humans almost exactly  with the exception of blue skin  Kree have a higher strength level than that of a human  and require more nitrogen to breathe comfortably  Kree bodies are adapted to environmental characteristics on Hala that are un Earthlike  they have a higher gravity and a higher concentration of nitrogen in the atmosphere  Under Earth s lesser gravity their strength and speed increase  However  they cannot breathe in Earth s atmosphere without using a chemical   breathing formula   or artificial life support devices  The original Kree had blue colored skin  but a second racial group with pink skin resembling that of human Caucasians emerged over the millennia  Presently  the blue skinned  purebred  Kree are a small  but powerful  minority  Pink Kree are much more durable than their blue racial brethren  Adult Kree range  typically  from between 5 to 8 feet  2 4 m  tall  Bilaterally  they are symmetric  with two legs and arms that end in feet and hands respectively  Their hands have four independently moving fingers each with opposable thumbs  They have heads with two forward facing eyes  allowing for precise stereoscopic vision  Adult Kree are usually covered in short  almost transparent  hair over most of their bodies  but sport thicker tufts of hair on top of their heads  Some female Kree can physically influence men  and a few can even drain the life force of others  The Kree were an evolutionarily stagnant race  This was due to a single member of the Kree race attempting to gain control of The Crystal of Ultimate Vision  1  This unnamed Kree found the crystal  but attempted to use it to become akin to a god  with powers as of those of the Phoenix Force  As punishment  the crystal  genetically froze their evolution in place  allowing the rest of creation to pass them by  In an attempt to further their development  some Kree bred with other species  producing the  pink skinned  Kree  who are similar in appearance to Caucasian humans  These pinks  also called  whites   eventually outnumbered the blue skin Kree  The Kree value what they consider to be their genetic purity  to such an extent that reproduction outside of the species is a strict taboo  In the Kree empire it is a crime for a male non Kree to impregnate any Kree  The Kree race has produced individual super humanoid beings  either through natural mutation  genetic engineering  or cyborg technology  including Captain Mar Vell  Ultimus  Shatterstar  Shatterax  Korath  and others  The Supreme Intelligence attempted to jumpstart the evolutionary process of the Kree  Through a series of events discussed below during Operation  Galactic Storm and the Destiny War  he arranged for a large number of his people to be irradiated with a Nega Bomb  killing 90  of the Kree   and then artificially sped up their evolution by means of an artifact called the Forever Crystal  volume  amp  issue needed  This new brand of evolved Kree  called Ruul  have a grayish skin tone and many shoulder length tentacles atop their heads  Individuals possess the ability to  will  adaptation to different environments  spontaneously developing the ability to breathe underwater  fly  or whatever their circumstances require   edit  Culture The Kree are a nationalistic  imperialistic and militaristic society with the only widespread religion being worship of the Supreme Intelligence  A small minority practice a pacifist Cotati religion  but this is forbidden  very early Captain Marvel stories mentioned an  idol  called Tam Borr and a  fabricated  god named Zo  whom Marvel served between issues 11 and 15   Some are members of the Universal Church of Truth  The Kree Empire extended throughout nearly a thousand worlds in the northwestern lobe  Earth reference  of the Greater Magellanic Cloud with outposts in other galaxies  Kree names are usually short  being one or two syllables  Given names are separated from surnames by a hyphen  Examples include Mar Vell  Yon Rogg  Una Rogg  and Zey Rogg  Some Kree have been given comic book references as names  such as Mar Vell  Marvel Comics   Att las  Atlas Comics   Dea Sea  DC Comics   and Star Lyn  Jim Starlin   Generally  the offspring of officers of the Kree Imperial Militia are immediately conscripted   edit  Population The Kree population was in excess of 30 billion prior to the nega bomb detonation  The Kree lost an alleged 98  of their population after the nega bomb detonated  Although the pink skinned Kree are in the majority  it is the blue skinned Kree  such as Ronan  who dominate their society   edit  Government Under the Supreme Intelligence  the Kree Empire was a military technocractic dictatorship  Under Clumsy Foulup  the Kree were temporarily a monarchy  and while under Ael Dan and Dar Benn they were a military dictatorship  Leaders of the Kree have included the Supreme Intelligence  Clumsy Foulup  Nenora  Zarek  Ael Dan and Dar Ben  Phae Dor  Tus Katt  Morag  Ronan the Accuser and most recently  Black Bolt of the Inhumans  The Kree began their empire over a million years ago  within a hundred years of the acquisition of interstellar technology from the Skrulls  at that time  a benevolent people   The Skrulls at the time were attempting to start a galactic empire of their own  this one based on free trade  and they landed on Hala to help the barbaric natives advance to the point where they could join  Although Hala is the official planet of the Kree s origin  for a time  the planet Kree Lar in the Turunal system served as the capital of the Kree Empire as well as the seat of the government  The Kree Empire is ruled as a militaristic dictatorship  The permanent ruler was the organic computer construct called the Supremor  or Supreme Intelligence   an immense computer system to which the preserved brains of the greatest intellects of the Kree race have been linked  Aiding the Supreme Intelligence were a number of imperial administrators on Kree Lar  who are also governors of each of the member worlds  and a vast standing space militia  They also employ powerful automatons called Sentries whose job it is to keep member worlds under the empire s watchful eye  The Kree empire is later ruled by Black Bolt and the Inhuman Royal Family who gained power after Ronan the Accuser  ruler of the Kree after the Supreme Intelligence s demise  submitted to him  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Religion According to Noh Varr the Kree have a mathematical equation that disproves the existence of any deity  which is taught to all Kree around  the same time we learn not to soil ourselves with excrement   2   edit  Technology The Kree Empire extends across almost a thousand worlds in the northwestern lobe  Earth reference  of the Greater Magellanic Cloud  They are the only race in the galaxy to possess the Omni Wave Projector technology  a device which can enable communication across hyperspace as well as be used in an offensive capacity as a weapon  They also possess cloaking technology  which they call the  aura of negativity   Kree technology includes advanced warp drive starships  advanced robotics  cyborg and cybernetic technology  advanced genetic engineering  psionic technology  Psyche Magnetron   advanced energy weaponry  Uni Beam   nuclear power and weapons   edit  Psyche Magnetron The Psyche Magnetron  for example  was a weapon that possesses matter shaping powers  Whosoever possessed it could conjure up anything ever devised by Kree Science  When its rays hit the user  it could create the device desired by the user and also modify the genetic structure of the body gifting it with super powers  The Magnetron Power Unit or Power Core was contained in a small shielded box  Unfortunately  it was extremely radioactive and  once outside of the box  it immediately changed its form to a bigger  starred polyhedron  It then emitted the same radiation emitted as the Psyche Magnetron when it bathed a subject  but in such a high quantities as to burn  blind  and totatally annihilate the senses instantly and  sometimes  even kill the subject in a few minutes  Through its rays  the user gained greater matter shaping powers  that  unfortunately  were very difficult to control  The radiations covered all the known spectrums and they were strong enough to transform an area as wide as  say  Northern Florida  into a radioactive wasteland   edit  The Destructoids  First appearance  Silver Surfer III  6 December 1987  The Destructoids were gargantuan weapons of war  each one manned by hundreds of men  They had two forms  1  A starship  It traveled through space until it arrived at its destination  2  A giant roughly humanoid configuration   Note  May have been only for travel inside a planet s atmosphere  Whatever form they took  they had great destructive firepower  so great that it only took two of them to pacify a primitive defenseless planet  In the latter form  their propulsion came out of the equivalent of their legs  and their blasts came out of the equivalent of their arms  In the former form  their propulsion came from the stern while they shot their blasts from the bow of the ship  It is believed that they had the ability to shoot blasts out of other areas  by any normal standard  were a force to be reckoned with   edit  Fictional history  edit  Antiquity Millennia ago a race of humanoid reptiles called the Skrulls came upon prehistoric Hala  At that time the Skrulls were a largely peaceful space faring race  and they set about educating the natives to the point where they could join their trading empire  However  Hala was home to two equally intelligent races  the Kree and the Cotati  The Skrulls proposed a test to determine the worthier race  This test involved taking 17 members of each race to distant planetoids in different solar systems in another galaxy  providing them with complete supplies to last one year  and then returning at the end of that period to judge the worth of what each group had managed to create  The Skrull starship took the Cotati to a barren moon in one solar system and then brought the Kree to Earth s moon where they created an arena  the Blue Area  and left them there  While the Cotati used their abilities to create a beautiful garden on their formerly barren moon  the Kree used the rudimentary technology provided by the Skrulls to construct a magnificent city  A year later the Skrulls returned to judge the accomplishments of the two groups and return them all to Hala  Once back on their homeworld  the Kree leader Morag learned that  although the Skrulls who had retrieved his group had been extremely impressed by the giant city  the other Skrulls were more impressed by the Cotati s success  Enraged  the Kree first wiped out the Cotati and then  when the Skrull delegation protested  killed them as well and seized the Skrulls  starship  They then set about deciphering the technology of the starship  3   edit  Kree Skrull War Main article  Kree Skrull War Within a hundred years of acquiring interstellar technology from the Skrulls  the Kree empire began to spread throughout the Greater Magellanic Cloud  The Kree launched an attack upon the Skrull empire and the peaceful Skrulls were again forced to become war like to defend themselves  The Kree Skrull War would continue for hundreds of thousands of years  At the same time the Cotati on Hala were almost driven to extinction by the Kree  However  a small handful of Kree  the pacifist priests of Pama  hid and kept safe a group of Cotati  Eventually these Kree began worshipping the Cotati that they had kept sheltered  To further hide and keep them safe  the priests relocated the surviving Cotati throughout the universe  About 250 years later the Kree Science Council  aware that the Skrulls had once created an incredibly powerful weapon called the Cosmic Cube  designed a cybernetic organic supercomputer called the Supreme Intelligence  sometimes referred to by the honorific  Supremor   to help them in creating a Cube  When the computer became functional  it determined that a Cosmic Cube would be too dangerous to construct and refused the Science Council s request  The computer was then used simply in an advisory capacity  At the beginning of the Kree Skrull War  millions of years ago in Earth time  the Kree established a station on the planet Uranus  a strategic position between the Kree and Skrull empires  Through their work at this station  they discovered that sentient life on nearby Earth had had genetic potential invested in it by the alien Celestials  Intrigued  the Kree began to experiment on Earth s then primitive homo sapiens  Their goal was apparently twofold   to investigate possible ways of circumventing their own evolutionary stagnation  and to create a powerful mutant race of soldiers for use against the Skrulls  However  although their experiments were successful in creating a strain of humanity with extraordinary and diverse abilities  it was assumed that the Kree apparently abandoned their experiments for reasons which are not yet clear  volume  amp  issue needed  However it was later revealed that the Supreme Intelligence had in fact predicted its death by the hands of these experiments and ordered their destruction  volume  amp  issue needed  Their test subjects  eventually dubbed the Inhumans  went on to form a society of their own  which thrived in seclusion from the rest of humanity  Their city Attilan has frequently been relocated  Its present location is above Hala  The Kree abandoned the project eventually  but stationed a giant surveillance robot  Sentry 459  on a small South Pacific island  The Fantastic Four s unwary awakening of the long dormant Sentry 4  alerted the Kree to Earth s advanced state of evolution  The Sentry s destruction brought the Kree official Ronan the Accuser  with the intent of passing judgment on those who  murdered  the outpost guard  He intended to punish the Fantastic Four  but they defeated him  5  Ronan s own defeat increased Kree scrutiny of Earth  setting off a chain of events that continues to reverberate  Over time  and as the war with the Skrull dragged on  the Supreme Intelligence gradually accrued more and more political power and responsibility until finally it was elected as absolute ruler of the Kree  Eventually  the Supreme Intelligence came to be worshipped and an organized religion built up around it   edit  The War Comes to Earth 6  The Earth s importance as a strategic beachhead became apparent when the Avengers became involved in the latest round of Kree Skrull hostilities  The Skrull were revealed to have been infiltrating human society in an effort to control America s political infrastructure  using their shape shifting abilities to replace key political figures  In the meantime  the Kree were reestablishing cultural ties with the Inhumans  ostensibly for the purpose of technological exchange  although their true intentions turned out to be far more sinister  At this point  Captain Marvel  former hero of the Kree Empire  approached the Avengers with evidence that renegade elements within the Kree Hierarchy  led by Ronan the Accuser  were planning to  erase  humanity through the use of exotic technology  This particular scheme was foiled by Marvel and the Avengers  comprised  at that time  of Goliath 2  Quicksilver  the Scarlet Witch  the Vision  Yellowjacket  the Wasp  and eternal side kick Rick Jones  but it proved to be only the tip of the iceberg  As the war escalated and Earth s position became increasingly precarious  the original Avengers  including Thor  Iron Man and Captain America  were recalled to active service after a Skrull scouting party  led by interstellar menace The Super Skrull  managed to abduct Marvel  Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch  The Skrull also attempted to destroy the Inhumans  Great Refuge with a nuclear level incendiary device  but failed when the Avengers intervened  This was the group s first inkling that an interplanetary war was being fought over possession of the Earth  During the ensuing conflict  the Super Skrull took his prisoners back to the Skrull home world  leaving the remaining Avengers to pick up the pieces and reform their tattered forces  The conflict worsened when the Avengers began to understand the scale of the war erupting all around them  Setting off in pursuit of their kidnapped allies  they discovered a vast  Skrullian  armada en route to devastate the planet Earth  an equivalent Kree fleet poised to annihilate the Skrulls  and a full scale insurrection breaking out between the Supreme Intelligence and Ronan the Accuser  All sides were determined to either invade or decimate the Earth in order to prevent it falling into the  wrong  hands  Led by Thor  Iron Man and The Vision  the Avengers launched an attack on the Skrull flagship  somehow managing to turn back the fleet after a desperate battle  during which Goliath 2 was deemed to be MIA and presumed dead when he attempted to stop a Skrull spacecraft from reaching Earth   The war came to a close 7  when the Supreme Intelligence managed to bring Rick Jones into his presence  The Intelligence had been usurped by Ronan the Accuser  but  as he explained to Rick in retrospect   he was still capable of channeling his powers through an agent  While the Intelligence cared little for the fate of Earth and its inhabitants  he recognized that the Kree Skrull war was futile  and temporarily altered Rick s DNA to release his  full evolutionary potential   Armed with godlike powers  Rick literally froze both Kree and Skrull forces in mid stride  allowing the Intelligence to re establish control over his people and bring the war to a halt  The effort proved too much for Rick s fragile human physiology  as he collapsed lifeless to the floor  the Supreme Intelligence teleported the remaining Avengers to his side to witness his grim sacrifice  The irony was not lost on the assembled heroes  who reflected that a frail teenaged boy had succeeded where all of their collective might had failed  The final act in the cosmic tragedy was played out by Captain Marvel  who   understanding the debt owed by all of them   agreed to merge his life force with Rick s body  bringing the boy back from the brink of death at the cost of their own individual freedom   edit  Further Kree Skrull Wars At several points in the years after the end of the first Kree Skrull war hostilities were said to have broken out again between the two empires  It is unclear how serious these conflicts were though they were often referred to as  wars   The most significant of these instances came when the Skrulls lost their ability to shapeshift  and a Skrull Warlord provoked new hostilities  During this war  the Supreme Intelligence was incapacitated by the Silver Surfer who removed the Soul Gem which the creature used to maintain peaceful balance between its blue and pink Kree components  Afterwards  Nenora  a Skrull spy in the guise of a high ranking Kree official  took command of the Kree empire  The war ended with Nenora s death at the hands of S ybill  the Skrull Empress  Rulership of the Kree was assumed for a time by an alien named Clumsy Foulup who was  however  soon assassinated by Kree military officers  The machinations of Thanos led to the sudden elimination of half the universe s life forms  Unaware of Thanos  role in the disappearance  the Kree and the Skrull blamed each other and temporarily renewed fighting  8   edit  Kree Shi ar War Main article  Operation  Galactic Storm Not long after the conflicts with the Skrull ended  the Kree again found themselves embroiled in a war  this time with the Shi ar Empire  This war was much shorter  and was engineered by the Skrulls and the Supreme Intelligence  The Avengers of Earth became involved in the conflict when the Shi ar opened a wormhole in Earth s solar system to gain rapid access to Kree territory  unconcerned about the damage that would be caused to Earth s Sun as a result  Their involvement inadvertently set off a chain of events which led to a Nega Bomb being detonated in Kree space  9  10  The bomb explosion  in which negative energy was released into space causing an extremely powerful explosive and radioactive reaction  devastated the Kree empire  and led to its surrender to the Sh iar  It was eventually revealed that the Supreme Intelligence was ultimately responsible for the bomb s detonation  as the whole thing was a bid to kick start the Kree race s genetic development  Kree territory was then annexed by the Sh iar  with Majestrix Lilandra naming her sister Deathbird as the territories  administrator  Deathbird has since abandoned this post   edit  Ruul and Retcon The remaining Kree were

Avengers  in the process  Hawkeye was killed  But this may not have been the real Kree  as the entire incident was later revealed to be a product of the Scarlet Witch s reality altering powers   edit
