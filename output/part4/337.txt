E L D   occurred during a trend for action series about secret international intelligence agencies with catchy acronyms  such as television s The Man from U N C L E  and James Bond s SPECTRE  citation needed  Colonel Fury  initially the lead character of Marvel Comics  World War II series Sgt  Fury and his Howling Commandos  was reimagined as a slightly older character with an eyepatch  which he lacked in his wartime adventures  and appointed head of the organization  Some characters from the Sgt  Fury series reappeared as agents of S H I E L D   most notably Timothy  Dum Dum  Dugan  Fury s bowler hat wearing aide de camp  2  Its most persistent enemy is HYDRA  a criminal organization founded  after some retcon  by Baron Wolfgang von Strucker  Despite that name s capitalization per Marvel s official spelling  HYDRA is not an acronym but a reference to the mythical monster  symbolizing the organization s claim of growing stronger the more it is wounded  Strange Tales  135  Aug  1965   the debut of S H I E L D  Cover art by Jack Kirby and Frank Giacoia  S H I E L D  was presented as an extant  full blown entity in its first appearance and much was revealed over the years to fill in its labyrinthine organizational history  Stan Lee wrote each story  abetted by artist Kirby s co plotting or full plotting  through Strange Tales  152  Jan  1967   except for two issues  one scripted by Kirby himself   148  and one by Dennis O Neil   149   Following an issue scripted by Roy Thomas   153   and one co written by Thomas and new series artist Jim Steranko  came the sole writer debut of soon to become industry legend Steranko who had begun on the feature as a penciller inker of Kirby layouts in  151  Dec  1966   taken over the every other issue  Nick Fury  cover art with  153 two months later  and full writing with  155  April 1967   Steranko quickly established the feature as one of comics history s most groundbreaking  innovative and acclaimed  3  The 12 page feature ran through Strange Tales  168  sharing that  split book  with the occult feature  Doctor Strange  each issue   after which it was spun off onto its own series of the same title  running 15 issues  June 1968 Nov  1969   followed by three all reprint issues beginning a year later  Nov  1970 March 1971   Steranko wrote and drew issues  1 3 and  5  and drew the covers of  1 7  New S H I E L

takeover attempt  A year after that series ended  the one shot Fury  May 1994  retconned the events of those previous two series  recasting them as a series of staged events designed to distract Fury from the resurrection plans of HYDRA head von Strucker  The following year  writer Howard Chaykin and penciler Corky Lehmkuhl produced the four issue miniseries Fury of S H I E L D   April July 1995   Various publications have additionally focused on Nick Fury s solo adventures  such as the graphic novels and one shots Wolverine Nick Fury  The Scorpio Connection  1989   Wolverine Nick Fury  Scorpio

H I E L D  was created by Nicholas Joseph Fury after the end of World War II  but Fury abandoned the idea and left the draft that he created for the agency locked away  feeling the U S  government wouldn t approve the formation of such an agency  At some unspecified point around this time  however  a United Nations based international group dusted off the idea without Fury s knowledge  citation needed  His recruitment to the post of executive director  the agency s second  marked his first knowledge of S H I E L D  s existence  A rare quiet moment for Nick Fury  Strange Tales  168  May 1968   Art by Jim Steranko and Joe Sinnott  Usually led by Nick Fury as executive director  although he reports to a twelve member council  whose identities even he does not know   this organization often operates as much as a covert agency as a quasi military one  initially depicted as affiliated with the United States government  Later  S H I E L D  was depicted as under the jurisdiction of the United Nations  with vast technological resources at its disposal  with U N  General Assembly Resolutions and legislation passed in signatory nations aiding many of their operations  4  5  However  S H I E L D  has been inconsistently portrayed as under U S   rather than U N   control  possibly by writers unaware of the agency s fictional history  For instance  in Astonishing X Men  3  Nick Fury explains S H I E L D  s inaction during an incident of genocide by stating that it did not occur on American soil  6  During the time that Godzilla roamed the United States  S H I E L D  formed a subunit  the  Godzilla Squad  to hunt the creature down  until it disappeared into the Atlantic sea  This unit  led by Dum Dum Dugan  employed such weapons as a giant robot called Red Ronin and a smaller version of the Helicarrier  known as The Behemoth  One of S H I E L D  s unique technological innovations  the LMD  Life Model Decoy  an extremely lifelike android used to replace people in imminent danger of being killed was the basis for two major upheavals  First  the supervillain Scorpio stole the technology and used it to create the second team of villains called the Zodiac  Later  some LMDs known as the Deltites achieved sentience and infiltrated S H I E L D   replacing key members  until Fury defeated them  This led to the disbanding of the original organization and its replacement by a new taskforce with the same acronym  In the wake of a disastrous unauthorized mission in Latveria  in the Secret War mini series  Fury effectively resigned as executive director  with international warrants out for his arrest  His first successor was not one of his closer associates but a relatively unknown newcomer to the S H I E L D  hierarchy  Maria Hill  A transcript of a conversation between Hill and the President of the United States 7  revealed she was chosen for the post by United Nations consensus to keep Fury loyalists out of the job and to keep relations with the superhero community to a minimum  The President also expected Hill an American to be loyal first to U S   despite S H I E L D  being a U N  chartered organization  Agents Valentina Allegra de Fontaine and Dum Dum Dugan  Strange Tales  168  May 1968   Art by Steranko and Sinnott  The passage of the United States  Superhuman Registration Act and the subsequent superhero  Civil War  created an additional political and ethical irritant between S H I E L D  and the superhuman community  with S H I E L D  tasked to lead enforcement and to take on registered superheroes as operatives  8  Toward the end of the conflict  Hill concluded she had been made director with the intent that she fail at the job  and she proposes to Tony Stark that he assume the post himself  with her as deputy  Stark accepts the appointment as director upon the conclusion of the superhuman Civil War  and undertakes a series of initiatives  including the construction of a new gold and red Helicarrier in the motif of his Iron Man armor designs  the introduction of a daycare center in the Helicarrier  and an employee suggestion box  While accused of treating S H I E L D  as a Stark Industries subsidiary  he succeeded in streamlining the organization and raising morale  9  S H I E L D  fought a wave of global superhuman terrorism and was manipulated into two international incidents that almost saw Director Stark arrested  until they revealed the Mandarin to be behind it and stopped him from committing genocide with an Extremis pathogen  At the start of the Secret Invasion by the extraterrestrial shape shifting race the Skrulls  the Helicarrier is disabled by a Skrull virus and left floating and disabled in the Bermuda Triangle  10  The Skrulls by this point have already replaced a large number of S H I E L D  agents  including the high ranking Timothy  Dum Dum  Dugan  11  After the invasion is repelled  the President of the United States decides to dissolve S H I E L D   12  and has it  the Fifty State Initiative  and the Avengers replaced by the Thunderbolts Initiative  which is placed under the supervision of Norman Osborn  13  Osborn uses the opportunity to transform S H I E L D  into a new organization called  H A M M E R    formed by loyal agents of the Thunderbolts Initiative as well as former agents of S H I E L D  as well as HYDRA  14  The Thunderbolts are officially disbanded in the process as well  He then turns the Thunderbolts into a black ops force that answers only to him  Meanwhile  H A M M E R  also operates alongside the newest  and only  government sponsored Avengers team  the Dark Avengers  15  After the Invasion  Nick Fury discovers that S H I E L D  itself had been under the control of the terrorist organization HYDRA ostensibly from its very beginning  12  After the conclusion of the Secret Warriors story  S H I E L D  was reformed  with Nick Fury leaving it under the control of its new Director  Daisy Johnson  codenamed Quake   edit  Organizational structure and procedure Over the decades  various writers have depicted S H I E L D  s organizational structure in several different ways  The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  first edition  describes an eight level ranking structure  technician  administrator  field agent  regional officer  special officer  regional director  special director  executive director   although providing almost no detail on other aspects of the Directorate s internal makeup  Years later  the miniseries Agents of Atlas mentioned a position of  sub director   and seemed to indicate that the administrative department of S H I E L D  it itself referred to simply as  Directorate   Most of S H I E L D  s agents are normal humans  At one point the organization attempted to set up a team of superhuman agents  composed of Marvel Man  the future Quasar   Texas Twister  Blue Streak and the Vamp but the latter two were secretly agents of the criminal organization The Corporation  and the team broke apart before it had its first official mission  citation needed  A second team organized years later also lasted only a short while  citation needed  S H I E L D  does employ some superhumans  including in its Psi Division  composed of telepathic agents who deal with like menaces  S H I E L D  also obtains help from independent heroes when their special abilities are needed  It has also accepted some superheroes and supervillains as members  but not in a separate unit   See  Membership   Its headquarters is the Helicarrier  a massive flying aircraft carrier kept airborne at all times and  among other things  containing a squadron of jet fighters and housing an intercontinental ballistic missile  ICBM   In addition  S H I E L D  maintains strong ties to the superhero community  especially Captain America  the Avengers  and the Fantastic Four  and often calls upon that community for aid on particular missions  In the 2000s  depictions of S H I E L D  imply a hierarchy of security clearance levels used either in place of  or alongside  the previously described rank structure  The security clearance hierarchy operates on a scale ranging from  Level One   the lowest  to  Level Ten   described by Maria Hill  executive director at the time  as the highest security clearance anyone of any government can have  Hill s own clearance  cited in the New Avengers ongoing series  was Level Nine  The first story arc in the series New Avengers  2005       Breakout   revealed an additional ranking   Champion Status   that effectively removes them from the traditional S H I E L D  hierarchy and  as Captain America comments  gives status holders such as himself the right to assemble any team to carry out any mission he believes necessary  In addition Nick Fury is the only  33rd degree  S H I E L D officer  meaning he is the only member of S H I E L D  present or past  to know the full existence of 28 emergencies  covert  back up bases scattered across the globe   edit  Equipment S H I E L D  has used a wide variety of advanced vehicles  weapons and other equipment  The S H I E L D  Helicarrier is the agency s signature capital ship and headquarters  The S H I E L D  Flying Car is the standard issue S H I E L D  vehicle  The S H I E L D  regulation issue sidearm was originally a  30 caliber rapid fire machine pistol  later replaced by an advanced plasma beam pistol  Nick Fury often carried his personal sidearm  the NF3000  a  15 caliber handgun  a weapon that fired explosive flechettes   edit

long been considered S H I E L D  s primary mobile home base  the Directorate also maintains a number of land bases throughout the world  most notably  S H I E L D  Central  in New York City  While some of these bases are publicly accessible on a limited basis  most are not publicly disclosed for reasons of planetary security  There are several fully equipped S H I E L D  fall out shelters scattered around the world  with twenty eight of these being known only to Nick Fury  During the events of Civil War  Nick Fury was hiding in an American based shelter  He also divulged the location of one to Captain America  so the Resistance to the Superhuman Registration Act could use it as a safe house   edit  Related organizations  edit  A R M O R  A R M O R   Altered Reality Monitoring and

Man  often insulted Nick Fury  and made bad jokes about the super villains  At the end of the game in which Fury sent Spider Man home and revealed he knows of his secret identity  apparently they

ensure verifiability  S H I E L D  stories have been translated into several other languages  including French  Finnish and Italian  Occasionally  these translations will show S H I E L D  with an altered name  In the case of selected French editions  the name of the agency was depicted as S E R V O   which sounds like  brain   cerveau  in French  In Finnish the name that applies to S H I E L D  in mainstream Marvel continuity is Y P K V V   Ylimm isen P  majan Kansainv lisen Vakoilun Vastustamisjaos   a direct translation of the original English  In translations of the Ultimate Marvel comics  the name is K I L P I   with  kilpi  being the translation for the word  as opposed to the acronym   shield   In Greek  the organization name is               pronounced ASPIDA  meaning  shield  in Greek   The initials stand for Supreme Military and Political Foundation of International Counter espionage                                                                 In Portuguese  the name S H I E L D  remains  but it is translated as  Superintend ncia Humana de Interven  o  Espionagem  Log stica e Dissuas o   i  e   Human Superintendence for Intervention  Espionage  Logistics and Dissuasion  In Dutch the name S C H I L D   schild   shield  has been used by the publisher Williams  but was dropped by Junior Press in favor of S H I E L D  In Mexico  it was translated by La Prensa and later Novedades  as C I D E L   Centro Internacional De Espionaje Legal  International Center Of Legal Espionage   but later Novedades changed the acronym to C S E I   Cuartel Supremo de Espionaje e Inteligencia  Supreme Headquarters of Espionage and Intelligence  In Spain  initial publisher V rtice translated S H I E L D  as  Escudo   always without a determinant   but never showed the meaning  Later publisher Planeta DeAgostini used the name S H I E L D   but translating the acronym as  Organizaci n Internacional para la Ejecuci n y el Cumplimiento de la Ley   international organisation for implementation and fulfillment of law   It has been suggested citation needed   as a joke  that the acronym does not correspond to the meaning because the acronym itself is undercover  Now  Panini translates the acronym as  Servicio Homologado de Inteligencia  Espionaje  Log stica y Defensa   Accredited Service of Intelligence  Espionage  Logistics  and Defense  to keep the original acronym  In Danish  S H I E L D  was originally known as S K J O L D    Skjold  being the Danish word for a shield  though the meaning of the abbreviation would differ   edit  See also List

more and more innovative  Entire pages would be devoted to photocollages of drawings  that  ignored panel boundaries and instead worked together on planes of depth  The first pages   became incredible production numbers similar in design to the San Francisco rock concert poster of the period   Larry Hama in his introduction to the trade paperback collection Nick Fury  Agent of S H I E L D   Who Is Scorpio   Marvel Enterprises  2001  ISBN 0 7851 0766 5   said Steranko  combined the figurative dynamism of Jack Kirby with modern design concepts  The graphic influences of Peter Max  Op Art and Andy Warhol were embedded into the design of the pages and the pages were designed as a whole  not just as a series of panels  All this  executed in a crisp  hard edged style  seething with drama and anatomical tension   The series won 1967 and 1968 Alley Awards  and was inducted in the latter year to the awards  Hall of Fame  Steranko himself was inducted into the Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2006
