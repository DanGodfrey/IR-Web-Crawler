Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus  TRNC   Turkish  Kuzey K br s T rk Cumhuriyeti   commonly called Northern Cyprus  is a self declared state 2  3  that comprises the northeastern part of the island of Cyprus  Recognised only by Turkey  4  5  6  7  Northern Cyprus is considered by the international community to be occupied territory 8  of the Republic of Cyprus  9  10  11  Northern Cyprus extends from the tip of the Karpass Peninsula in the north east  westward to Morphou Bay and Cape Kormakitis  the Kokkina Erenk y exclave marks the westernmost extent of the area   and southward to the village of Louroujina Ak nc lar  A buffer zone under the control of the United Nations stretches between Northern Cyprus and the rest of the island and divides Nicosia  the island s largest city and capital of both states  Tensions between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot populations in Cyprus culminated in 1974 with a coup d  tat  an attempt to annex the island to Greece  and an invasion by Turkey in response  This resulted in the partitioning of the island  12  13  14  15  the resettlement of many of its inhabitants  and a unilateral declaration of independence by the north in 1983  Due to its lack of recognition  Northern Cyprus is heavily dependent on Turkey for economic  political and military support  16  17  Attempts to reach a solution to the Cyprus dispute have been unsuccessful  Recognising the need for a resolution  in May 2008 the two sides began negotiations after committing themselves to working towards a bicommunal  bizonal federation with political equality  as defined by relevant Security Council resolutions  18  The Turkish Army maintains a large force in Northern Cyprus with its presence supported and approved by the TRNC government  which the Republic of Cyprus and the international community regard as an illegal occupation force  with its presence denounced in several United Nations Security Council resolutions  19  Contents 1 History

Turkish invasion of Cyprus See also  History of Cyprus  Cyprus under the Ottoman Empire  Cyprus dispute  and Operation Atilla A united Cyprus gained independence from British rule in August 1960  after both Greek and Turkish Cypriots agreed to respectively abandon plans for enosis  union with Greece  and taksim  Turkish for  partition    The agreement involved Cyprus being governed under a constitution which apportioned Cabinet posts  parliamentary seats and civil service jobs on an agreed ratio between the two communities  Within three years  tensions between the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots in administrative affairs began to show  In particular  disputes over separate municipalities and taxation created a deadlock in government  In 1963 President Makarios proposed unilateral changes to the constitution  via 13 amendments  Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots rejected the proposed amendments as an attempt to settle constitutional disputes in favour of the Greek Cypriots 20  and as a means of demoting Turkish status from co founders of the state to one of minority status removing their constitutional safeguards in the process  Turkish Cypriots filed a lawsuit against the 13 amendments in the Supreme Constitutional Court of Cyprus  SCCC   Makarios announced that he would not comply with whatever the decision of the SCCC would be  21  and defended his amendments as being necessary  to resolve constitutional deadlocks  as opposed to the stance of the SCCC  22  On 25 April 1963  the SCCC decided that Makarios  13 amendments were illegal  On 21 May  the president of the SCCC resigned due to the Makarios  stance  On 15 July  Makarios ignored the decision of the SCCC  23  After the resignation of the president of the SCCC  the SCCC ceased to exist  The Supreme Court of Cyprus  SCC  was formed by merging the SCCC and the High Court of Cyprus and undertook the jurisdiction and powers of the SCCC and HCC  24  On 30 November  Makarios legalized the 13 proposals  A map of the Turkish Cypriot Enclaves before 1974 military operations In 1963  the Greek Cypriot wing of the government created the Akritas plan which outlined a policy that would remove Turkish Cypriots from the government and ultimately lead to union with Greece  The plan stated that if the Turkish Cypriots objected then they should be  violently subjugated before foreign powers could intervene   25  On 21 December 1963  a Turkish Cypriot crowd clashed with the plainclothes special constables of Yorgadjis  Almost immediately  intercommunal violence broke out with a major Greek Cypriot paramilitary attack upon Turkish Cypriots in Nicosia and Larnaca  Though the TMT   a Turkish resistance group created in 1959 to promote a policy of taksim  division or partition of Cyprus   in opposition to the Greek Cypriot nationalist group EOKA and its advocacy of enosis  union of Cyprus with Greece    committed a number of acts of retaliation  historian of the Cyprus conflict Keith Kyle noted that  there is no doubt that the main victims of the numerous incidents that took place during the next few months were Turks   20  Seven hundred Turkish hostages  including women and children  were taken from the northern suburbs of Nicosia  Nikos Sampson  a nationalist and future coup leader  led a group of Greek Cypriot irregulars into the mixed suburb of Omorphita and attacked the Turkish Cypriot population  26  By 1964  193 Turkish Cypriots and 133 Greek Cypriots had been killed  with a further 209 Turks and 41 Greeks missing and presumed dead  Turkish Cypriot members of the government had by now withdrawn  creating an essentially Greek Cypriot administration in control of all institutions of the state  Widespread looting of Turkish Cypriot villages prompted 20 000 refugees to retreat into armed enclaves  where they remained for the next 11 years  27  relying on food and medical supplies from Turkey to survive  Turkish Cypriots formed paramilitary groups to defend the enclaves  leading to a gradual division of the island s communities into two hostile camps  The violence had also seen thousands of Turkish Cypriots attempt to escape the violence by emigrating to Britain  Australia and Turkey  28  The view of Turkish Cypriots  The Cyprus Supreme Court s ruling found that Makarios had violated the constitution by failing to fully implement its measures and that Turkish Cypriots had not been allowed to return to their positions in government without first accepting the proposed constitutional amendments  29  Also  Turkish Cypriots did not self segregate themselves  then United Nations Secretary General  U Thant s S 5950  10 September 1964  report  paragraph 180  UNFICYP carried out a detailed survey of all damage to properties throughout the island during the disturbances  it shows that in 109 villages  most of them Turkish Cypriot or mixed villages  527 houses have been destroyed while 2 000 others have suffered damage from looting  As a result  the Turkish Cypriot Provisional Administration was founded on 28 December 1967  The view of Greek Cypriots  the Turkish Cypriots  withdrawal from the government and their retreat into enclaves was a voluntary action  prompted by their desire to form a state of their own  the then United Nations Secretary General  U Thant  in 1965 stated that Turkish Cypriots had furthered a policy of  self segregation  and taken a  rigid stand  against policies which might have involved recognizing the government s authority  30  Founder  and former President  Rauf Denkta  On 15 July 1974  the Greek military junta of 1967 1974 backed a Greek Cypriot military coup d  tat in Cyprus  President Makarios was removed from office and Nikos Sampson took his place  Turkey claimed that under the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee  the coup was sufficient reason for military action to protect the Turkish Cypriot populace  and thus Turkey invaded Cyprus on 20 July  Turkish forces proceeded to take over the northern four elevenths of the island  about 37  of Cyprus s total area   The coup caused a civil war filled with ethnic violence  after which it collapsed and Makarios returned to power  citation needed  After the hostilities in 1974  the Greek Cypriots in Rizokarpaso agreed to live under Turkish Cypriot administration and stayed in Northern Cyprus  Other Greek Cypriots in the North  approximately 160 000  fled to the south  while 50 000 Turkish Cypriots fled north  Some population transfers were made in accordance with the Population Exchange Agreement between Turkish and Greek Cypriots under the auspices of United Nations on 2 August 1975  31  Approximately 1 500 Greek Cypriots and 500 Turkish Cypriots remain missing  32  In 1975 the  Turkish Federative State of Cyprus   K br s T rk Federe Devleti  was declared as a first step towards a future federated Cypriot state  but was rejected by the Republic of Cyprus  the UN  and the international community  After eight years of failed negotiations with the leadership of the Greek Cypriot community  citation needed  the north declared its independence on 15 November 1983 under the name of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus  33  This unilateral declaration of independence was rejected by the UN and the Republic of Cyprus  In recent years the politics of reunification has dominated the island s affairs  It was hoped that Cyprus s planned accession into the European Union would act as a catalyst towards a settlement  and in 2004 a United Nations brokered peace settlement was presented in a referendum to both sides  The proposed settlement was opposed by both the president of Cyprus  Tassos Papadopoulos  and Turkish Cypriot president Rauf Denkta   in the referendum  a majority of Turkish Cypriots accepted the proposal  but Greek Cypriots overwhelmingly rejected it  As a result  Cyprus entered the European Union as a divided island  with Northern Cyprus effectively excluded  Denkta  resigned in the wake of the vote  ushering in the pro solutionist Mehmet Ali Talat as his successor  However the pro solutionist side and Mehmet Al Talat lost momentum  because of the ongoing embargo citation needed  and isolation  despite promises from the European Union of easing them  which did not occur  and as a result the Turkish Cypriot electorate became frustrated  This led ultimately to the pro independence side winning the general elections in 2009 and its candidate  former Prime Minister Dervi  Ero lu winning the presidential elections in 2010  Although his side and he himself disagrees with and opposes re unification with the Republic of Cyprus  and favours the unity of and close relations between northern Cyprus and Turkey and supports the independence of the former  he nevertheless is negotiating with the Greek Cypriot side towards a settlement for reunification  In 2011  Turkish Cypriots protested the economic reforms and the Turkish and Northern Cyprus governments  Government and politics Main article  Politics of Northern Cyprus Politics of Northern Cyprus takes place in a framework of a semi presidential representative democratic republic  whereby the President is head of state and the Prime Minister head of government  and of a multi party system  Executive power is exercised by the government  Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Assembly of the Republic  The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature  The president is elected for a five year term  The current president is Dervi  Ero lu who won the presidential elections on 18 April 2010  The legislature is the Assembly of the Republic  which has 50 members elected by proportional representation from five electoral districts  In the elections of April 2009  the right leaning pro independence National Unity Party won an overall majority  34  Due to Northern Cyprus  isolation and heavy dependence on the support of Turkey  Turkey has a high level of control over decisions in Northern Cyprus  This has led to some experts stating that it runs as an effective puppet state of Turkey  35  36  37  Few political decisions in Northern Cyprus are taken without the approval of the Turkish National Security council in Ankara  17  The European Court of Human Rights gives Northern Cyprus  dependence on Turkey as the reason for its non recognition of Northern Cyprus  legal system  holding Turkey responsible for human rights in Northern Cyprus  37  International status and foreign relations Main article  Foreign relations of Northern Cyprus London office of Northern Cyprus  Bedford Square  A photo of Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus border  The international community  with the exception of Turkey  4  does not recognise Northern Cyprus as a sovereign state  but recognises the de jure sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus over the whole island  The United Nations considers the declaration of independence by Northern Cyprus as legally invalid in several of its resolutions  9  10  In wake of the April 2004 referendum on the United Nations Annan Plan  and the support of the Turkish Cypriot community for the plan  the European Union made pledges towards ending the isolation of northern Cyprus  These included measures for trade and 259 million euro in aid  In 2004  the Organisation of the Islamic Conference upgraded the delegation of the Turkish Cypriot Muslim community from  observer community   1979  to that of a constituent state with the designation  Turkish Cypriot State   making Northern Cyprus an observer member of the organization  38  A number of high profile formal meetings have also taken place between former President Mehmet Ali Talat and various foreign leaders and politicians including the former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  the then British foreign minister  Jack Straw and former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf  and between President Dervis Eroglu and Ban Ki Moon  In 2004  the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe gave observer status to the representatives of Turkish Cypriot Community  39  Since then  Northern Cyprus s representatives have actively participated in all PACE activities without voting rights  The Autonomous Republic of Nakhichevan  Azerbaijan  has issued a resolution recognizing Northern Cyprus  independence  but Azerbaijan has yet refrained to officially support this decision due to the Nagorno Karabakh issue  40  The European Union considers the area not under effective control of the Republic of Cyprus as EU territory under Turkish military occupation and thus indefinitely exempt from EU legislation until a settlement has been found  The status of Northern Cyprus has become a recurrent issue especially during the recent talks for Turkey s membership of the EU where the division of the island is seen as a major stumbling block in Turkey s road to membership  41  42  On 18 February 2008  the Northern Cyprus government sent a message to the Republic of Kosovo congratulating it on its unilateral declaration of independence  A government spokesman clarified that this statement did not constitute  or signal an imminent move toward  formal diplomatic recognition of Kosovo  43  In contrast  the Republic of Cyprus has rejected Kosovo s declaration of independence  and in lieu of the ICJ ruling that Kosovo s declaration of independence was not illegal stated that Kosovo and Northern Cyprus were not analogous situations  44  It is argued by some analysts that the independence of Kosovo could provide support for the recognition of Northern Cyprus  45  Military Northern Cyprus has an indigenous 5 000 man Turkish Cypriot Security Force  TCSF   which is primarily made up of conscripted Turkish Cypriot males between the ages of 18 and 40  There is also an additional reserve force consisting of about 11 000 first line  10 000 second line and 5 000 third line troops conscripted up to the age of 50  The TCSF is lightly armed and heavily dependent on its mainland Turkish allies  from which it draws much of its officer corps  It is led by a Brigadier General drawn from the Turkish Army  It acts essentially as a gendarmerie charged with protection of the border of Northern Cyprus from Greek Cypriot incursions and maintaining internal security within Northern Cyprus  46  In addition  the mainland Turkish Armed Forces maintain a Cyprus Turkish Peace Force  CTPF  consisting of around 30 40 000 troops drawn from the 9th Turkish Army Corps and comprising two divisions  the 28th and 39th  It is equipped with a substantial number of United States made M48 Patton main battle tanks and artillery weapons  The Turkish Air Force  Turkish Navy and Turkish Coast Guard also have a presence in Northern Cyprus  Although formally part of Turkish 4th Army  headquartered in  zmir  the sensitivities of the Cyprus situation means that the commander of the CTPF also reports directly to the Turkish General Staff in Ankara  The CTPF is deployed principally along the Green Line and in locations where hostile amphibious landings might take place  46  The presence of the mainland Turkish military in Cyprus is highly controversial  having been denounced as an illegal occupation force by the Republic of Cyprus government  Several United Nations Security Council resolutions have called on the Turkish forces to withdraw  19  Administrative divisions Main article  Districts of Northern Cyprus Northern Cyprus is divided into five districts  Map of Northern Cyprus   Districts  name Lefko a  Nicosia  Gazima usa  Famagusta  Girne  Kyrenia  G zelyurt  skele Geography and climate Coastline in Northern Cyprus  The winter in Northern Cyprus is cool and rainy  particularly between December and February  with 60  of annual rainfall  47  These rains produce winter torrents that fill most of the rivers  which typically dry up as the year progresses  Snow may fall on the Kyrenia Range  but seldom elsewhere in spite of low night temperatures  The short spring is characterized by unstable weather  occasional heavy storms and the  meltem   or westerly wind  Summer is hot and dry enough to turn low lying lands on the island brown  Parts of the island experience the  Poyraz   a north westerly wind  or the sirocco  a wind from Africa  which is dry and dusty  Summer is followed by a short  turbulent autumn  Climate conditions on the island vary by geographical factors  The Mesaoria Plain  cut off from the summer breezes and from much of the humidity of the sea  may reach temperature peaks of 40 45  C  Humidity rises at the Karpaz Peninsula  Humidity and water temperature  16  C 28  C  combine to stabilize coastal weather  which does not experience inland extremes  The Southern Range blocks air currents that bring rain and atmospheric humidity from the south west  diminishing both on its eastern side  Education Main article  Education in Northern Cyprus The education system in Northern Cyprus consists of pre school education  primary education  secondary education and higher education  Five years of primary education is mandatory  There are more than 40 000 university students in

education sector is USD 400 million in 2011   52 Industry  light manufacturing  contributes 22  of GDP and agriculture 9   53  Because of its status and the embargo by the Republic of Cyprus citation needed   Northern Cyprus is heavily dependent on Turkish economic support  54  It uses the New Turkish Lira as its currency which links its economic status to the Turkish economy  Since the Republic of Cyprus joined the Euro zone and the movement of peoples between the north and south were relaxed  the Euro is also in wide circulation  citation needed  Most exports and imports have to take place via Turkey unless they are produced locally from materials sourced in Cyprus  or imported via one of the island s recognised ports  when they may be exported via one of the legal ports  citation needed  The continuing Cyprus problem adversely affects the economic development of Northern Cyprus  The Republic of Cyprus  as the internationally recognised authority  has declared airports and ports in the area not under its effective control closed  All U N  Member countries and E U  member countries respect the closure of those ports and airports according to the declaration of the Republic of Cyprus  55  On 16 July 2011  North Cyprus started to sell electricity to Cyprus  56  Despite the constraints imposed by the lack of international recognition  the economy of Northern Cyprus turned in an impressive performance in the last few years  The nominal GDP growth rates of the economy in 2001 2005 were 5 4   6 9   11 4   15 4  and 10 6   respectively  57  58  The real GDP growth rate in 2007 is estimated at 2   53  This growth has been buoyed by the relative stability of the Turkish Lira and a boom in the education and construction sectors  Between 2002 and 2007  Gross

for Northern Cyprus   57  58  Official estimates for the GDP per capita in current US dollars are US 8 095 in 2004 and US 11 837 in 2006  1  Although the economy has developed in recent years  it is still dependent on monetary transfers from the Turkish government  Under a July 2006 agreement  Ankara is to provide Northern Cyprus with an economic aid in the amount of  1 3 billion over three years  2006 2008   53  This is a continuation of ongoing policy under which Turkish government allocates around  400 million annually from its budget to help raise the living standards of the Turkish Cypriots  59  Communications and transport A Boeing 737 800 of Cyprus Turkish Airlines  now operated by AtlasJet International telephone calls are routed via a Turkish dialling code   90 392  as

of the embargo citation needed  on Northern Cypriot ports  60  The airports of Ge itkale and Ercan are only recognised as legal ports of entry by Turkey and Azerbaijan  61  Direct charter flights between Poland and North Cyprus started on 20 June 2011  62  The seaports in Famagusta and Kyrenia have been declared closed to all shipping by the Republic of Cyprus since 1974  63  By agreement between Northern Cyprus and Syria  there is a ship tour between Famagusta and Latakia  Syria  Since the opening of the Green Line Turkish Cypriot residents are allowed to trade through Greek Cypriot ports  64  Naturalised citizens of Northern Cyprus or foreigners carrying a passport stamped by Northern Cyprus authorities may be refused entry by the Republic of Cyprus or Greece  65  although after the accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the EU such restrictions have been eased following confidence building measures between Athens and Ankara citation needed  and the partial opening of the UN controlled line by Northern Cyprus authorities  citation needed  The Republic of Cyprus also allows passage across the Green Line from the south of Nicosia  as well as a few other selected crossing points  since Northern Cyprus does not leave entry stamps in the passport for such visits  There are seven border crossings between Northern Cyprus and the Republic of Cyprus  66  Since May 2004 some

local newspapers  The government has been accused of deceit and of deliberately under counting the population since the turnout in the April 2009 election was 373 161 people  The government has also been criticized of announcing overestimates of 700 000 before the census  71  72  73  Estimates In 2010  the International Crisis Group estimated that the total population of Northern Cyprus was 300

indicated the number of Turkish Cypriots as 102 000 and Greek Cypriots as 450 000  79  Estimates state that 36 000  about 1 3  Turkish Cypriots emigrated in the period 1975 1995  with the consequence that within Northern Cyprus the native Turkish Cypriots have been outnumbered by settlers from Turkey  78  Northern Cyprus is almost entirely Turkish speaking  English  however  is widely spoken as a

Cypriot administration and stayed in Northern Cyprus even after the hostilities in 1974  The other Greek Cypriots in the North chose to live under Greek Cypriot administration and fled to the South  in accordance with the Population Exchange Agreement between Turkish and Greek Cypriots under the auspices of United Nations on 2 August 1975  31  As a result  Rizokarpaso is the home of the biggest Greek speaking population in the north  The Greek Cypriot inhabitants are still supplied by the UN  and Greek Cypriot products are consequently available in some shops  citation needed  Culture Sports

pertaining to the question of missing persons  discrimination  the right to life  freedom of religion  and economic  social and cultural rights   82  Freedom House has classified the perceived level of democratic and political freedom in Northern Cyprus as  free  since 2000 in its Freedom in the World report  83  The United States Department of State reported in 2001 that human rights were generally respected  although problems existed in terms of police activities and the restriction of movement  84  A 2009 report reported that religious freedom was generally respected  although isolated incidents of discrimination have existed  85  The US Department of State report in 2002 stated that freedom of speech and press was generally respected in Northern Cyprus  86  and the World Press Freedom Index 2010 ranked Northern Cyprus 61st in terms of freedom of the media  87  In 2001  the US Department of State said that Greek Cypriot and Maronite minorities are not treated as well as they should be  84  However  another US Department of State report in 2002 reported that the government of Northern Cyprus was easing restrictions on minorities and it respected the rights of travelling abroad and emigrating  86  although they still cannot vote in elections  88  In April 1998  the United Kingdom based National Coalition of Anti Deportation Campaigns asserted that the
