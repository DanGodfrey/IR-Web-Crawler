matter  Not when all Hulk has to do is become ten times as mad      Savage Hulk   Early Years Bruce s mother killed by his father Added by Moshikal15 Robert Bruce Banner is the son of Dr  Brian Banner  an atomic physicist  and his wife Rebecca  Although Rebecca deeply loved Bruce  who returned her affection  Brian hated the child  An alcoholic  Brian was driven by an insane jealousy of Bruce for being an object of Rebecca s love  Further  Brian believed that his radiation work had altered his DNA and given him a mutant son  Brian abused Bruce and finally murdered Rebecca and was placed in a mental hospital  Bruce  a highly withdrawn  intellectual youth  in fact  a child prodigy 1   was raised by his aunt  Mrs  Drake  and internalized his great pain and rage over his childhood sufferings  After graduating from Science High School  Bruce studied nuclear physics in Navapo  New Mexico  at Desert State University as the star student of Professor Herbert Josiah Weller  He also studied for a time at Pennsylvania State University  where he met Walter Langkowski  later Sasquatch   He obtained his doctorate in nuclear physics at the California Institute of Technology  alongside Phillip Sterns  later Madman   Eventually  as an adult and a genius in nuclear physics  Banner went to work at a United States Defense Department nuclear research facility at Desert Base  New Mexico  There Banner met General Thaddeus E   Thunderbolt  Ross  the Air Force officer in command of the base  and his daughter Betty Ross  Banner and Betty eventually fell in love with each other  Banner designed and oversaw construction of the  Gamma Bomb  or  G bomb   a nuclear weapon possessing a high gamma radiation output  The Hulk Banner was present in the instrumentation bunker at the test site for the first underground test detonation of the Gamma Bomb  Observing that a civilian had breached security and entered the restricted test area  Banner told his colleague Igor Starsky to delay the countdown while he tried to get the civilian to safety  Starsky  secretly a Soviet agent  did nothing  confident that Banner would die in the explosion  bringing the project to a halt  Reaching the civilian  a teenager named Rick Jones  Banner threw him into a protective trench  Before Banner could get himself to safety  the Gamma Bomb detonated  and intense waves of radiation reached the surface  Banner was irradiated with highly charged radioactive particles  Due to an unknown genetic factor in his body  Banner was not killed by the radiation  which instead caused him to frequently transform into the vastly powerful  gray skinned  humanoid monster named  the Hulk   2  Pelted by Gamma Rays Added by Brian Kurtz At first Banner changed into the Hulk at sunset and reverted to human form at dawn  However  Banner s body eventually changed so that his transformations into Hulk were triggered by the release of adrenalin when he became intensely excited  no matter what time of day or night it was  Usually the Hulk possessed little of Banner s memory and intelligence and was easily enraged  While the military attempted to contain Hulk  he thwarted their every attempt  with Rick Jones  feeling responsible for Banner becoming Hulk  trying to help him keep away from the military  Hulk ultimately thwarted an attempt to destroy America by the Gremlin  another being mutated by gamma radiation  Hulk changed back into Banner and help cure the Gremlin  who helped Banner escape back to the U S   where  with the help of Rick Jones  he maintained his identity as Hulk a secret and attempted to keep the Hulk contained at night 2   Early Adventures When Bruce next turned into the Hulk  his skin was green  a skin tone that remained the most constant for the Hulk  Banner became a target of the so called Toad Men  who sought to invade Earth  Although at first their attempts to exploit Banner s intelligence made him appear to be a traitor to his country  Banner was able to use his might as Hulk to thwart the Toad Men s invasion and cleared his name 3    In an effort to control his transformations  Banner began using a Gamma Ray Projector to force transformations to Hulk and Banner vice versa  however his Hulk persona was reluctant to transform back into Banner 3   After the Hulk was shot into space and passing through a radiation storm Rick Jones briefly found himself able to control him  They worked together to stop the Circus of Crime  Jones  control over the Hulk faded away  Hulk s transformations were not limited to nightfall after this adventure 4   The Hulk vs  the Thing  Added by JWGucciEnvy Hulk next foiled a hoax perpetrated by the Russian agent Boris Monguski  Mongu  aimed at trying to learn the secrets of the Hulk s strength 5   saved Betty from the underground ruler Tyrannus  and battled the Chinese General Fang 6   When Gamma Base was the subject to sabotage  Hulk was blamed and the Fantastic Four were called in to deal with him  This led to the first of many clashes between Hulk and the Fantastic Four s Thing  In the aftermath  the scientist Karl Kort was ultimately held responsible 7   Shortly thereafter  Hulk prevented Metal Master from invading Earth 8   The Sentry The Sentry met the Hulk and found that somehow his powers soothed the Hulk s raging temper  They were partners for a time  battling the Sentry s eternal enemy  the Void  Eventually Sentry had to erase his existence from the minds of the world and Hulk forgot about his one time partnership with the Sentry for many years 9   Added by Peteparker The Avengers Hulk became a pawn of Loki who tricked Hulk into battling his half brother  Thor  This plot was foiled  leading to Hulk  Thor  Iron Man  Ant Man  and the Wasp joining forces to form the Avengers and defeat Loki 10   Hulk was a founding member of the group and together they clashed with Dr  Doom 11   The group s mistrust in him became apparent when they were manipulated by the Space Phantom  prompting Hulk to quit 12   The Avengers began hunting down their unpredictable former ally  Hulk found an ally in the Sub Mariner  and clashed with the heroes  Thor in particular 13   but Hulk was defeated and disappeared in the water 14   Hulk soon resurfaced in New York City seeking revenge against the Avengers  clashing with them as well as the Fantastic Four  leading to a rematch with Thing  The battle ended with Hulk being swept away in the New York harbor 15   Hulk resurfaced back in New Mexico where he was tricked by the Avengers into aiding them in preventing the Lava Men s attempt to eradicate human life on Earth s surface 16   While hiding out in a cave near Hollywood  Hulk was disturbed when the Green Goblin s plot to use the Enforcers to kill Spider Man encroached into his hiding spot  leading to a brief clash between Hulk and Spider Man before Hulk fled the scene 17   Later  Hulk was manipulated into battling his former Avengers comrades Giant Man and Wasp by their foe the Human Top 18   Back at Gamma Base Banner continued his stint as a scientist at Gamma Base  Meanwhile  General Ross suspected Banner of being a spy and having some sort of connection with Hulk  The base soon became the target of the Chameleon who had been hired to steal a new experimental robot tank designed by Banner 19   Banner s attempt to stop the spy was complicated by the arrival of Lt  Glenn Talbot at Gamma base  who shared General Ross s suspicions  20  When the military decided to move Banner and his tank to another base  the Chameleon s employer  the Leader  deployed his Humanoid to steal it  Hulk battled the Humanoid and prevented it from stealing the device  Banner was arrested by the military under suspicion of having something to do with this attempted theft  21  Banner remained a prisoner until Rick Jones revealed Banner s double identity to the President of the U S   earning him a pardon  22  Banner went to Astra Island with his new experimental absorbatron device  The island was attacked by Leader s Humanoids  but Hulk defeated them  22  The battle ended with Banner being captured by Communist agents  Banner refused to work for the Communists and the Hulk freed himself and the other captured scientists  23  Thanks to the sacrifice of one of these scientists Hulk was able to fight his way out of Russia and ended up in Mongolia  24   There Banner was picked up by thief Kanga Kahn who attempted to hold Banner for ransom for safe return to America  Glenn Talbot  believing him to be a traitor  was sent to retrieve Banner 25  but Hulk left Talbot behind and returned to the U S  where Banner was arrested  Banner was again pardoned by the President and was allowed to return to Astra Island for another test  26  The Leader s Humanoids attacked again and Hulk and the Absorbatron were once again captured  27  Banner used one of Leader s devices to bring the army to the site  By the time they arrived  Hulk had sent the Leader fleeing  The military drove the Hulk back  only to find a seemingly dead Banner when they searched the site of the battle  28  Rick Jones stole Banner s body and attempted to revive him in his lab Another bombardment with the Gamma Ray Projector triggered a transformation into Hulk  but for the first time ever Banner s mind possessed Hulk  This came at a cost  if Hulk reverted back to Banner  he would die due to a shrapnel lodged in his brain  Leader showed the power of the stolen Absorbatron to potential buyers by sending a gigantic Humanoid to attack Gamma Base  29  The Hulk and Rick Jones were knocked away from the battle when General Ross fired his new  Sunday Punch  missile destroying the giant Humanoid  When Hulk and Rick sought refuge in one of Banner s secret labs the military followed them  Banner sent Rick out to hold up the military during an air strike  Leader teleported Hulk away seeking to form an alliance with him  The military assumed that their assault had atomized the Hulk  30  Hulk refused to ally himself with Leader  Realizing something was wrong  Leader bombarded him with more gamma radiation and removed the shrapnel from his brain  He then sent the Hulk to the Watcher s home planet in order to steal the Ultimate Machine 31   He clashed with the Amphibian  an alien who also sought the Ultimate Machine  and bested him in combat  and was returned to Earth  Leader took the Ultimate Machine from Hulk and attempted to use the device  Leader s plan backfired  as the machine seemingly killed him  32   Hulk vs  Amphibian Added by IronMonger2001 Learning that Rick Jones was a prisoner

General Ross and Glenn Talbot  34  Learning that the Hulk was alive and well  Talbot hounded the Hulk again with Banner s replacement Konrad Zaxon  This prompted Rick to also tell Betty about Banner s double identity  35  Ultimately  Hulk killed Zaxon for trying to use the Hulk as a battery for weapons he hoped to use to take over the Earth  The military chased after Hulk not knowing of Zaxon s true plans  The fleeing Hulk had a brief clash with Hercules  36  Then  Hulk was used as a pawn by Tyrannus who was then at war with another underground dweller  the Mole Man  over the Fountain of Youth  37  38  Later  Hulk was caught in the middle of the Secret Empire agent Boomerang s attempt to steal the new Orion missile  taking Betty as his prisoner  Hulk managed to defeat Boomerang and

body began to lose molecular cohesion  The Hulk s body soon followed suit and he was defeated by the Avengers 127   With the aid of the synthezoid Vision  Bruce was re merged with the Hulk  The original Hulk persona assumed control of the body 128   however the reintegration was unstable and an attempt to stabilize and possibly cure Bruce in a nutrient tank resulted in the Hulk returning to his original gray incarnation who only manifested at night  Rick Jones absorbed the excess gamma radiation and became a light green Hulk like creature 129   Bruce reasoned the best way to cure Rick was to use the machine from Hulk s Cave to change himself into the Hulk  Little did he know that this was a subliminal suggestion placed by Hulk himself  who once free smashed the machine to avoid turning back into Banner  Complicating matters  the Leader arrived  having followed the Hulk in hopes of regaining his faded intellect  When he found the machine destroyed  the Leader made a deal with

end through the machinations of the Maggia  Banner found Betty working in a convent when he was attacked by Prometheus  an agent of a team called the Pantheon  The stress and anger of being unable to

granddaughter Janis to fight his future self  Maestro  Maestro was a tyrant who had killed all the heroes and villains on earth and named himself emperor of the post apocalyptic world  He had the intelligence of Banner and was twice as strong as the Hulk  Maestro was killed when Hulk sent him back in time to ground zero at the moment the gamma bomb that created him had gone off  After killing Maestro the Hulk was sent back to the present  haunted by the thought of losing control and becoming Maestro  Soon after this Rick and Marlo were married  At the wedding Betty told Hulk that she wanted to move into the Mount to be with him  After the wedding Hulk was attacked by the disgraced Skrull warrior Talos the Tamed  In an effort to gain back some honor Talos wanted to be killed by earth s strongest warrior  Hulk refused to fight because of how well his relationship with Betty was going and he didn t want to risk losing his temper again  Later  Hulk received news that his old partner Jim Wilson was at an AIDS protest that was getting out of control  He took him back to the Mount to give him treatment but despite the advanced technology Jim still died  Having discovered the truth about Agamemnon  Hulk and the rest of the Pantheon made him stand trial  Agamemnon resurrected all of the dead Pantheon warriors to kill everyone in the Mount  Agamemnon tried to escape but was killed by Atalanta which brought an end to the undead warriors  Achilles  still loyal to Agamemnon  tried killing teammate Ulysses but the bullet ricocheted and hit Betty  The Hulk became so angry

up by Paris telling him that he was now the leader of the Pantheon and that Hulk was fired  Living under the last name Danner  Hulk and Betty moved to a small town in Florida  To hide his green skin  Hulk wore bandages all over his body and claimed to be a burn victim  Soon after their move a child was killed by a gigantic shadowy figure  and the Hulk was suspected of the crime because of his size  Upon investigation Hulk found out that the true killer was a deranged old man living in the everglades with the Man Thing  and rescued a child  A few days later Hulk and Betty offered their help to a young pregnant homeless girl While at the clinic protesters attacked and the girl was shot and killed  Hulk offered the girls  father his help in bringing her killer to justice  They learned the killer was just a kid who had accidentally shot her when someone pushed him  The father revealed himself to be Speedfreek and tried to kill the kid  Hulk hurled a car battery at Speedfreek which covered him in battery acid burning most of the skin off his face and causing him to flee  Hulk learned that the Abomination was fighting cops in the sewers of New York and decided that it was his problem  The homeless were being cleared out because the police commissioner was working for a drug lord who needed the sewers for new drug routes  While Hulk and confronted the Abomination  the cops used the opportunity to clear out the homeless by killing almost all of them  Abomination snapped and started killing all of the cops then took his battle with the Hulk to the surface  They crashed through the Daily Bugle before the Abomination jumped onto a news copter and crashed it  He used the opportunity to escape while Hulk was distracted  Ghosts of The Future An army squad led by Matt

with the mind of the Hulk  ran towards a grenade and nearly died when it went off  He was able to transform into the Hulk before he could be killed but shrapnel was left in his brain extremely hindering his intelligence  Seeking a device to remove the shrapnel he traveled to the Leader s Freehold  With the Leader dead  the hidden arctic sanctuary Freehold had been placed in the care of Omnibus  Omnibus believed that there would eventually be a nuclear war that would kill everyone on earth so he decided to speed it up by ordering terrorist attacks across the world to cause strain on global relations  He had also mentally controlled many high ranking government officials including Talbot which explained his insane behavior  Jailbait overheard Omnibus s plan and exposed him to the people of Freehold and he was sentenced to death  Hulk decided that the best way to save the world would be to pose as Maestro and claim to be the man behind the terrorist attacks  A psychotic Thor was sent to defeat him  It was a close battle until an atom bomb was dropped on top of them  The Hulk was believed dead by most of the world but he had actually used a hidden Pantheon base to survive

showed up and the Hulk broke free  Moments later Jason the Renegade stepped from the shadows and shot the Hulk with a Pantheon gun which caused the soldiers to panic and begin shooting  Hulk laughed off the bullets and escaped with Janis leaving Betty in tears  The Pantheon had become a democracy and had outvoted Paris to bring Hulk back into the group  Paris approached Henry Gyrich with a proposition to take down the Hulk for good  The Pantheon attacked Janis and appeared to kill Hulk  but it was actually just a mindless cloned body created by the Pantheon  Hulk destroyed their ship and headed towards Washington DC with Janis where she told the military that the Hulk wouldn t run anymore  If they attacked him he would attack a major city in retaliation  While he was traveling through the Midwest Hulk and Janis were attacked by the Thunderbolts whom he easily defeated  then he destroyed a dam to fulfill his promise of retaliation  Hulk began having chest pains that would force him to keel over in pain although at the same time he was physically becoming more powerful  Dr  Strange found that because of his split from Banner  excess energy from an alternate universe was channeling through him that could destroy the universe  Under extreme emotional stress Hulk returned to the gamma base where he was created  He was ambushed by the newest person placed in charge of capturing the Hulk  Colonel Cary St  Lawrence  Hulk considered this the ultimate invasion of privacy because he considered the gamma base  his place   He was about to kill her when he had the idea to take over an island in the Florida Keys which he renamed Hulk Island  He saved the inhabitants from a hurricane and they grew to respect him  A few days after the hurricane Janis showed up with an alternate Hulk that came to Earth 616 when the Hulk was teleported away by Dr  Strange  He offered his help to Hulk but the shrapnel in his brain was making him angry at everything so he fought him until he was taken back to his own time  Apocalypse restrains the Hulk  Added by DCincarnate Hulk was manipulated by Apocalypse into becoming one of his Horsemen  Hulk agreed to serve him if

the Celestials  He nearly killed the Absorbing Man and Juggernaut but Rick jumped in and Hulk swung at him  Seeing the crippled body of his best friend caused the Hulk to break free of the mind control and flee in shame  Mercy sensed the Hulk s desire for death and sent him on a path to fight Mr  Hyde  but the Hulk wanted a good death and refused to be killed by what he considered an unworthy foe  Wanting to help put the Hulk out of his misery  Mercy sent him to one of his deadliest enemies  the Abomination  Sulking through New York Hulk found the Abomination but because of all the damage done to his brain he hallucinated himself in the Abomination s place and he began letting out all his built up rage from the last few months on him  Heroes Return By this point  the Celestials had come to judge which universe would live and which one would die  Universe 616 or Franklin Richard s Counter Earth pocket dimension  They sent their agent Ashema to Earth to show Franklin Richards his handiwork and force him to choose between one world and another  At this point the Hulk on Earth 616 was on a rampage through New York City  bringing Doc Samson  Hercules  Spider Man and the Thunderbolts together to try and stop him  Meanwhile on Counter Earth  the Banner Hulk was on rampage through New York City as well clashing with the Thing and Thor  Dr  Strange found a link between the trans dimensional energies coming from the Hulk s body and from Franklin Richard s mysterious blue ball  Bringing the ball in close proximity to the Hulk caused both he and Spider Man to be transported to Counter Earth where the two Hulks clashed  attracting the attention of the Fantastic Four  Avengers  and Dr  Doom  It was decided that in order to save both realities from destruction  all the Earth 616 heroes would have to return to their native world  Both Hulk and Banner were brought back with them  When they breached the gulf between both worlds the Hulk and Banner were merged back together again 144   Self Destruction After finally being reunited with Banner the Hulk was transported to the site of his birth  the gamma bomb test site  The strain on his body was slowly killing him and he was giving off massive amounts of radiation that was sufficient enough for the Maestro to absorb and return to life  Maestro was taken by trolls to be the newest mind to inhabit the Destroyer  Bruce and General Ross were attacked by the Destroyer and his troll minions  During the battle the Destroyer stepped in a pool of Hulk s blood  It recognized that Hulk and Maestro were the same being and drew the Hulk s mind inside of it  Hulk was able to outsmart Maestro and crush him under a rock slide  Bruce was brought back to Gamma Base where he established some kind of control over the Hulk and started rebuilding his life with Betty and made peace with her father  General Ross  Later  the Troyjans attacked and Bruce and agreed to meet with their leader  Lord Armageddon  After seeing Bruce leave with the aliens the press believed that he had heroically sacrificed himself to save the president s daughter  Armageddon wanted Hulk s help in resurrecting his son Trauma with device the the Leader had previously used to bring Marlo back to life  The device needed a very large gamma power source in order to work and he planned on sacrificing Hulk to do it  Bruce said no but Hulk agreed and stepped into the machine  During the process Hulk gave off too much radiation and incinerated Trauma s body  Armageddon agreed to live in peace out of fear of punishment from the Silver Surfer  but after Hulk left he leveled Freehold and killed everyone living there including the gamma beings Jailbait and Hotshot  Bruce was given a secret pardon for his crimes as the Hulk for saving the president s daughter  Death of Betty Banner The Defenders Added by Moshikal15 Just when everything started going right with the Hulk  Betty nearly died due to gamma

killed her General Ross started to hunt the Hulk once more  Bruce figured out the truth behind Betty s death when he went to the home world of the Watcher and was given infinite knowledge  He returned to Earth to get revenge on the Abomination but he let him go  Confronting General Ross he told him that they were both to blame for Betty s death  Due to the deteriorating effects of ALS and the chaos ravaging his mind scape  Banner cut a deal with the three dominant Hulk personalities   the Green Hulk  the Gray  Joe Fixit  Hulk and the  Professor  Hulk   essentially to time share their existence in return for stabilizing his fractured psyche and providing him with release from his disease  The Leader provided the means to cure Bruce  The original Defenders  including Hulk  re formed when Yandroth surfaced again to menace the world  Though the heroes defeated his plan  Yandroth used his sorcery to levy a deathbed curse upon their heads  binding them to come together in times of crisis  The curse magnified the egos of the cursed quartet until they became mentally unstable  They became the Order  seeking to end all threats to the Earth by taking control of it  Other heroes fought them

was stabbed by Skaar and turned out to be Betty herself  158  The Leader escaped and the Cathexis Ray Generator machinery was reversed and all the radiation from the Hulked Out Heroes returned back to the Helicarrier  Bruce then absorbed all the energy to contain it at the behest of Reed Richards  Doc Samson died trying to help  The Helicarrier crashed and the Worldbreaker Hulk emerged from the rubble  159  Skaar had his chance to fight the Hulk at last  During the confrontation  Hulk rescued innocent bystanders endangered by their fight  Skaar reacted to this act of compassion by ceasing his assault  but Hulk continued his  causing Skaar to revert to human form  Hulk was reminded of Banner s own abusive father and reverted to human form as well  Banner apologized and embraced his son  Scaar accepted his love  The Hulk Family Return of the Worldbreaker  Added by Jibers The Red Hulk set himself up in the White House  planning to take over America  However the Hulk showed up to foil

energy  the stronger the Hulk got  the stronger he got  When the Red She Hulk interfered with the conflict he hit her with the full force of his power  In a rage  the Hulk killed Arm Cheddon  Fear Itself Nul  Breaker of Worlds  Added by Drakolord7 When the Serpent was freed by Skadi  he called seven hammers to Earth  The Hulk was transformed by one of these hammers  becoming one of the Worthy  Nul  Breaker of Worlds  Rampaging through South and Central America  Nul was eventually transported to New York City where  teaming with the Angrir possessed Thing  the two began battling a lonesome Thor  Only upon exhausting his powers was Thor able to defeat the duo  with Nul being launched into Earth orbit  Landing in Romania  Nul immediately began heading for the base of the vampire king Dracula  Opposed by Dracula s forces  including a legion of monsters  Nul was seemingly unstoppable  160  Only after the intervention of Raizo Kodo s Forgiven was Nul briefly slowed  161  Ultimately  Nul made his way to Dracula s castle where the timely arrival of Kodo and Forgiven member Inka  disguised as Betty Ross  was able to throw off the effects of the Nul possession  Throwing aside the hammer  the Hulk regained control  and promptly left upon realizing  Betty s  true nature  162  Claiming that he wanted to be alone  Hulk separated himself from Banner and went to ask Doctor Strange for help to stop Nul  Asunder Something is missing     Added by Black Diesel Sometime later  Bruce Banner and Betty Ross are relaxing on a tropical island in an attempt to reconcile their relationship  However  their moment is ruined when a guide shows to up inform Banner that he s ready to test the island for radiation  Since Betty knows that something s up  Banner admits that though the Hulk was an accident  it was the greatest of his achievements  As she transforms into Red She Hulk  Betty wonders whether she fell in love with the man or the monster and leaps away  Hulk with the Moloids Added by Black Diesel Since being split from Bruce Banner without any severe side effects  the Hulk has gone underground  living with a tribe of Moloids as a hunter  Though well loved  the Hulk has no interest in celebration with his adopted family  The Moloid elder walks up to the Hulk and assures him that he s safe down underground  but the Hulk doesn t believe him  With some reluctance  the Hulk decides to join the party  Then suddenly  robotic drones and drills burst into cavern  Their leader  someone in a powered exoskeleton  tries to subdue the Hulk with sonic disruptors but he fights back  The leader sheds her armor to announce herself as Commander Amanda von Doom  no relation to Dr  Doom   asking for his help on behalf of the American government concerning Banner  Above ground  animals are being rounded up by a duo of bipedal  gamma irradiated warthogs called 26 and 27  They bring their latest catch to their revered father  Bruce Banner  Apparently  Banner has been experimenting on various creatures in an attempt to replicate the circumstances that made him into the Hulk  but every attempt has resulted in nothing but failure  including a tumor the size of a grapefruit and an island full of gamma irradiated monsters  Elsewhere  Amanda von Doom brings the Hulk up to the surface and introduces him to her team  Gor and B R A I N  Though the Hulk doesn t believe that he should be involved  Amanda s base is attacked by gamma sharks  After killing them all and ending up on Banner s island  Amanda trying insisting to the Hulk that he must help them  The Hulk refuses and tunnels back underground  In the Moloid Caves  the Moloids expect that the Hulk has returned  But it s not  Banner s monstrosities  26 and 27 have arrived to kill all that the Hulk loves  Incarnations All four incarnations  in the current timeline   Added by Halley You  can t  break  a  man  who s  already  been  broken    Bruce Banner The Hulk initially is characterized as a separate entity from Bruce Banner  a distillation of his human anger that gradually develops its own personality and memories separate from Banner s  Banner suffers from  multiple personality disorder   which stems from the abuse he suffered as a child  The Hulk has many incarnations  each representing a different aspect of Banner s psyche  there are hundreds or possibly thousands of other Hulk personalities  but only a few major versions have been seen to date  Savage Hulk Added by Cpowell187 Bruce Banner   Bruce Banner is the emotionally repressed core personality  possessed of genius intellect  Banner can transform into the different versions of the Hulk  whereas his alter egos seem to be able only to transform into Bruce Banner  Savage Hulk   The Savage Hulk is the most common version of the Hulk  though it possesses the mental capacity and temperament of a young child and typically refers to himself in the third person  He often claims that he wants to be left alone  The Savage Hulk is usually depicted as green skinned and heavily muscled with a loping  ape like gait  While in a functionally calm emotional state  or at least as calm as the Hulk can be  the Savage Hulk is capable of lifting about 90 tons  When angry  however  he is capable of lifting well over 100 tons  with the potential for limitless strength  depending on the height of his temper  Joe Fixit  Added by Sjtaylor65 Gray Hulk Joe Fixit   The Gray Hulk worked for a time as a Las Vegas enforcer called  Joe Fixit   The Gray Hulk has average intelligence  although he occasionally displays knowledge and intellectual ability normally associated with Banner  He is cunning  crafty  hedonistic  arrogant  and distant  with a hidden conscience  In most of his Las Vegas appearances  he appears only at night  According to the Leader  the Gray Hulk persona is strongest during the night of the new moon and weakest during the full moon  This aversion to sun moon light vanished when the Gray Hulk s night induced transformation trigger was later removed  Although he is the smallest of the Hulks  the Gray Hulk towers over the average human  He prefers to dress in tailored suits  Joe Fixit s base strength level is also the lowest of the three primary Hulk incarnations  While in a functionally calm emotional state  Joe Fixit is able to lift about 70 tons  Gravage Hulk Post Heroes Return Hulk   The Gravage Hulk is a merger of the Savage and Gray Hulk personae  It was caused when Banner had control over the Hulk s personality after using his Gamma Projector  This Hulk persona displayed the cunning intellect of the Gray Hulk and the raw power of the Savage Hulk 5  163   The Professor  Added by Ultimatex The Merged Hulk The Professor   The Merged Hulk was once believed to be the merger of Banner and the Savage and Gray Hulks  The Merged Hulk was later discovered to be The Professor  The Professor  rather than being a merger of the three core personalities  was actually a fourth  separate personality that represented Banner s ideal self  The Merged Hulk was an associate and leader of the team of superheroes called the Pantheon  Despite his exaggerated musculature  the Merged Hulk had a relatively normal looking face  resembling that of Banner  The Professor is the largest of the three primary Hulk incarnations and he also possesses a higher base strength level  While in a calm emotional state  the Professor is capable of lifting about 100 tons  However  unlike the other Hulk incarnations  Bruce Banner subconsciously installed a type of safeguard within the Professor  When the Professor s anger reaches a certain level  he will transform back into Bruce Banner  though with the mind and personality of the Savage Hulk  Due to this safeguard  the Professor is ultimately the weakest of the three primary Hulk incarnations despite being the physically largest  The Maestro   The Maestro is a alternate version of the Hulk from a future timeline when he has conquered mankind after it had already been brought to the brink of extinction through nuclear warfare  The Maestro s green skin is darker than that of the other green skinned incarnations  and his hair is gray and balding on top  Due to the increased radiation from nuclear fall out  the Maestro is significantly stronger than the Merged Hulk  as demonstrated in the  Hulk  Future Imperfect  mini series   and his strength still increases with rage  making him more powerful still  The Maestro s base strength level is considerably greater than that of the other primary Hulk incarnations  including his younger self  The Maestro s body absorbed the ambient radiation of the nuclear fallout  dramatically increasing his strength  While calm  the Maestro can lift well over 100 tons  The Mindless Hulk  Added by Ultimatex Mindless Hulk   Nightmare  in an attempt to find new ways to hurt his enemy Doctor Strange by going through his friends  penetrated Bruce Banner s mind and discovered his influence had an unexpected side effect  a new personality began to develop out of Banner s worst visions of the Hulk  At this period in Banner s life  he had just gained control over the Hulk s body  but was constantly on alert and terrified this was just temporarily  and that the Hulk  which he saw as nothing but a savage and destructive beast  would break free once more when the world least expected it  Far from being identical with the original Hulk  this version was based on a nightmarish imagination made of all of Banner s worst fears and ideas of his former alter ego  Nightmare continued to manipulate and increase his influence  allowing this dark incarnation to gradually rise to the surface  It finally became its own personality after Banner made his  psychic suicide   allowing it to break free of Banner s domination  Eventually  with the assistance of three creatures created by his subconscious   Glow  Goblin  and Guardian   this Hulk gained the ability to speak and behave much less savagely  Since then  this personality has not been seen again  and it has been suggested that it is no longer a part of Banner s personality  A part of the Hulk  with the assistance of Doctor Strange  entered the Dimension of Nightmare as a similar manifestation as Mindless Hulk  threatening to kill him  Nightmare was forced to seek out Spider Man s help  as this Hulk was destroying the whole domain  Spider Man eventually pushed the Hulk into another realm  but he pulled Nightmare in with him  Nightmare has since been seen still alive  but this Hulk seems to have disappeared  While calm  the Mindless Hulk can lift well over 100 tons  The Guilt Hulk  Added by Ultimatex The Guilt Hulk   Known as  The Beast   the Guilt Hulk is another of Bruce Banner s personae  though this one created by his regret  The Guilt Hulk originally manifested itself in Banner s mind as his father and tormented him by forcing him to relive memories of his traumatic childhood  Eventually  the Guilt Hulk was defeated by Banner himself  The Guilt Hulk later returned after Betty s death  albeit much more powerful because of Banner s emotionally fractured state  After beating the Professor and Joe Fixit  the Guilt Hulk was eventually put down after the Savage Hulk joined forces with his other incarnations  Banner believes it has been destroyed  Due to its monstrous size  the Guilt Hulk was physically very powerful  It also possessed claws and spikes all over its body  The Guilt Hulk also showed the ability to breathe fire on one occasion  The Devil Hulk  Added by Sith my ride s Return Devil Hulk   The Devil Hulk is the malevolent  amoral  personality of Bruce Banner  personifying all of Banner s resentment at the way he is treated by the world  He is also one of the Hulk s enemies  constantly threatening to escape confinement in Banner s mind and destroy the world in revenge  Banner first encountered this Hulk after the Guilt Hulk resurfaced  on a mental journey to stop the creature  Chained and bound deep within Banner s mind  the Devil Hulk offered his assistance against the Beast  as the only personality who could ignore Banner s guilt  in return for his release  Banner refused  leaving the Devil Hulk still chained  but he escaped into Banner s psyche a short while afterwards when the machinations of General Ryker shattered the barriers keeping him imprisoned  Fortunately  he was finally contained in Banner s subconscious by Banner  the Savage Hulk and Joe Fixit  It is assumed that while calm  the Devil Hulk can lift well over 100 tons  Green Scar  The Worldbreaker Added by Drakolord7 The Green Scar   The Hulk of World War Hulk is a cunning and more powerful version than the previous incarnations  for he is the insanely enraged version of the  Gravage Hulk   His rage is at its most focused  due to meditation training by his ally Hiroim  This incarnation has extremely high durability  He has had training in combat arms  including broadswords  spears  and battle shields  and is a capable leader and strategist  Another source of the Green Scar s strength in comparison to other versions was his lack of inner conflict  if not alliance  with Bruce Banner  There were several instances where the Hulk and Banner worked together strategically  such as acting to disable Dr Strange  Caiera  the Green Scar s wife  understood Banner as well  and both personalities loved her equally  This was the driving factor in the Banner Hulk alliance  As a result of being caught in the explosion of the warp core of his ship which brought him to Sakaar  which destroyed the planet  Green Scar s base level of strength was dramatically increased  He can lift well over 100 tons in a functionally calm emotional state  During a burst of unexplained anger from the Hulk in New York City  Professor X attempted to slow down the angered Hulk with intense power  however  the Hulk proved to be resistant to the Professor s psionic effects citation needed   The Green Scar reached a new level of anger at the end of World War Hulk  after his fellow Warbound Miek attempted to provoke him to destroy the world  At this level  he started to release huge amounts of gamma energy from within his body  devastating New York  and causing quakes across North America  It would have taken but a couple of footsteps from the Hulk to completely destroy the eastern seaboard  If he hadn t let himself be stopped  then he definitely would have lived up to his  Worldbreaker  title  and would have completely destroyed the Earth  After World War Hulk  Banner suppressed the Green Scar  preventing him from surfacing  He momentarily reappeared in battle with the Hulk s son Skaar  still identifying himself as the  Worldbreaker   He seems to have resurfaced after Bruce regained his Hulk powers  his anger tempered from its  Worldbreaker  levels by another confrontation with Skaar  and was proven even strong enough to take down the Red Hulk without much of a fight  Powers and AbilitiesEdit Powers The Hulk is one of the most powerful beings in the universe since his powers increase with his rage  He is capable of matching the strength of beings like Thor  Silver Surfer  and the Sentry  Transformation  The process by which Banner usually transforms into the Hulk is presumably the result of the chemical catalyst  adrenaline  a k a  epinephrine   As in normal human beings  Banner s adrenal medulla secretes large amounts of adrenaline in time of fear  rage  or stress  which hormonally stimulates the heart rate  increases blood sugar levels  and inhibits sensations of fatigue  Whereas the secretion heightens normal physical abilities in normal human beings  in Banner s case it triggers the complex chemical extra physical process that transforms him into the Hulk  The total time of transformation falls anywhere between seconds to five minutes  depending on the initial adrenalin surge  which will be determined by the original stimulus  Soon after the transformation  the amount of adrenalin in the Hulk will return to more normal  reduced levels  However  there have been instances in which Banner became the Hulk without any discernible increase in heart rate or adrenal levels  suggesting that the true trigger mechanism into the Hulk is far more psychological than physical  When the Hulk transforms back into Banner  the excess muscle mass and energy is lost  presumably to the same place he derives it  Superhuman Strength  The Hulk possesses the capacity for virtually limitless physical strength  164  31  36  165  166   However  each of the primary Hulk personalities possesses a base strength level  While in a calm state  the Gray Hulk is able to lift 70 tons  the Savage Hulk could lift 90 tons  and the Professor Hulk can lift about 100 tons  The incarnation referred to as the  Green Scar  is the physically strongest of all the primary Hulk s incarnations  After being exposed to the energies from the exploding core of the ship that originally brought him to Sakaar  Green Scar s base strength level was dramatically increased  While in a calm state  this incarnation was able of lifting well over 100 tons  However  while in an enraged state  adrenaline surges through Hulk s body increasing his strength considerably above his base limits  Among his amazing feats are supporting a falling 150 billion ton mountain with leverage 167   ripping through a bunker designed to withstand the explosion of thousands megatons in magnitude 168   eventually overpowering the Invisible Woman  the Thing and the Human Torch 169   matching the Scarlet Witch  prior to House of M  and Wonder Man  Iron Man and Vision  while the narration establishes that the Hulk s power is greater than their combined might 170   matching the Super Adaptoid after acquired strength and durability of 100 heroes like Iron Man and Vision 171   easily closing the doors to a nuclear core that Thor and Thing together couldn t budge 134   reflecting Gladiator s ocular beams back into both eyes  and knocking him unconscious 172   knocking the Silver Surfer out with three blows 173   matching two Avengers teams during a prolonged period of time despite become gradually weaker due to separation from Banner 174   almost breaking the East Coast and threatening to break the whole planet by the emission of raw power from his body 146   destroying the Crypto Man after he was boasted with physical strength beyond that of the Thor  175   overpowering Thor 176   pushing two spheres of matter and antimatter apart 177   holding together all the tectonic plates of a planet 178   overpowering a field of energy with sufficient power to change the orbit of a planet 46   destroying an asteroid twice the size of the planet Earth with a single punch due mainly to the superior toughness and also to the impulse generated by the contraction of both legs 179   overcoming a power draining mechanism which contained much of the combined power from himself  and also from Doctor Strange  the Silver Surfer and Namor  180   applying force to the entire space time structure to prevent all the Defenders from being sucked into a fissure  119   effortlessly smashing adamantium  165  181   breaking up the space time continuum  86   ripping off a powerful device designed to fight against the Celestials significant  even if it could only withstand power equivalent to Odin  182   and to overcome Onslaught s enormous strength 130  who was at least Celestial level in raw power 183    If his strength was potential via reality warping  instead of being intrinsic  it would be equally accessible  Additionally  this feat was accomplished by the Classic Savage Hulk  as the Hulk was not physically separated from Bruce Banner and he also spoke in the third person  However  probably his greatest feat was to send pure concussive energy throughout countless dimensions by the impact of his collision with Ironclad 184   Thor even stated that the Hulk may be stronger 185   The Hulk also grows stronger the more radiation 55  186  187  188  and the more dark magic 189  he catalyzes  Superhuman Stamina  The Hulk s body counteracts fatigue poisons that build up in his muscles during physical activity  In an enraged state  he is capable of exerting himself at peak physical capacity for several days before fatigue begins to affect him  However  much like his physical strength  the Hulk s stamina does increase as he becomes angrier 190   Superhuman Durability  In addition to great strength  the Hulk s body possesses a high degree of resistance to injury  The Hulk s skin is impervious to conventional blades  adamantium and vibranium being amongst the very few metals that are truly capable of piercing his skin  The Hulk is capable of withstanding high caliber bullets  powerful explosives  pressures extremes  falls from orbital heights  191  192   maximized heat without blistering  maximized cold without freezing  and great impacts  The Hulk has withstood the impact of a ground zero nuclear explosion  72  193  194  98  195  196  and also the Human Torch s Nova Blast  197  187   with a temperature of one million degrees Fahrenheit  without any injury  The Hulk was also able to withstand a planet devastating impact near of the event 198   a planet shattering impact at point blank range 179   and a mighty blast from Galactus 199   The Hulk s durability  like his strength  is fueled by rushes of adrenaline while angry 190   Regenerative Healing Factor  Despite his high resistance to physical harm  it is possible to cause the Hulk injury  However  he is capable of regenerating damaged or destroyed areas of his body with far greater speed and efficiency than an ordinary human  For example  during a battle with Vector all of the skin and much of the muscle mass of the Hulk were damnified  It took the Hulk moments to regain the mass and be completely healed 200   The Hulk s healing factor also enables him to revert any physical transmutation 201  202  203  204  188   Hulk also heals faster and more efficiently the madder he gets 190   Immortality  For all intents and purposes the Hulk is immortal  Because of his healing factor that regenerates his cells  and the gamma energy and the dark magic he has absorbed that empowers him  the Hulk is immortal  A possible future persona  the Maestro  was in physical prime in spite of being more than one hundred years old  205   In another alternate future it is implied that the Hulk s body effectively lasts forever  206   Superhuman Leaping Ability  The Hulk is able to use his highly developed leg muscles to leap great distances  While calm  he is capable of leaping roughly three miles  However  as he becomes enraged  his strength increases considerably  which means he can jump much farther than usual  On more than one occasion  the Hulk has nearly jumped into orbit 192  207   Hulk was able to cover 1 000 miles with a single leap 208   He jumped on top of Mount Olympus from ground level  in a single leap  209   The Hulk also shows incredible precision with his ability to aim his jumps and landings  He grabbed missiles on multiple occasions and landed on islands barely visible from the height he fell from 208   Superhuman Speed  Regardless of his size  Hulk s superhumanly strong legs allow him to run at speeds that are far beyond the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete  about 700 mph   Nevertheless  this does not grant him any enhanced reflexes or agility as smaller foes exploit his size and use it to their advantage  However  he has been fast enough to catch mortar shells shot at him 210   Adaptation to Hostile Habitats  There have been several instances in the past where Hulk has not only spent extended periods of time in oxygen less outer space without suffocating  but has moved his mouth and spoken in these environments  The Hulk is capable to adapt to inhospitable environments whenever it is necessary 211   Like his healing factor  it is believed that this ability is also fueled by his rage and the madder the Hulk is  the quicker the Hulk s body will adapt  Self Sustenance  The Hulk can survive on very little sustenance  but after the Hulk adapts to a hostile environment  like space  he no longer needs sustenance and does not need air  water  food  or sleep  Underwater Breathing  The Hulk has been on the ocean floor a number of times  He is able to breathe due to his body developing a gland which creates an oxygenated perfluorocarbon emulsion which fills his lungs and equalizes the pressure 89  100   He is therefore able to breathe fluid and avoid decompression and nitrogen narcosis  Resistance to Psychic Control  In many instances and occasions  the Hulk has demonstrated great psychic resistance as side effect of his rage and the multiple personalities inside his mind 212  46  213  214  215  216   Immunity to All Diseases and Viruses  The Hulk is immune to all known Earth based diseases and viruses  including AIDS  217  218   He can operate under intense conditions for extended periods of time due to his body not developing fatigue toxins quickly  Extrasensory Perception  Astral Form Perception  The Hulk has the unique ability of being able to see  astral forms   or ghosts  219   This power has come in handy when working with his fellow Defender  Dr  Strange  who is able to leave his body in an usually invisible  ghost like state better known as an astral form  Banner subconsciously feared his father s ghost would come back to haunt him  and so the Hulk developed this mechanism to allow him to look out for him  More recent events have shown that the power to see astral forms may now extend to Bruce Banner  However  it was suggested the clarity of the astral forms is diminished when compared to the Hulk s ability to view them  The Hulk s ability to see astral forms may go beyond just seeing individual spirits  The Hulk once experienced a whole town in the middle of the desert that faded away into nothing  While it is possible it was merely a mirage  it is possible the Hulk was able to see a town that didn t exist in our plane of reality that no one else could see  Homing Ability  The Hulk also has a seemingly mystical homing ability that enables him to locate the area in New Mexico where he first became the Hulk 122   This applies even if the Hulk is in another dimension  An image of the Maestro once explained to Bruce that the reason he was able to do that was because the Maestro s spirit was there  calling to him  However  since the time Maestro was resurrected the Hulk has continued to return to the gamma bomb site  suggesting that there is more to his ability than merely the Maestro s spirit  This homing ability has also been used to find people on rare occasions  For example  the Hulk was able to dig a tunnel underground exactly in the direction of the Onslaught  While it is possible that Onslaught was mentally leading the Hulk to him  there were other instances of Hulk demonstrating this ability  The Hulk s instincts led him to Rick Jones and Betty and the Hulk located the Abomination with no prior knowledge of his whereabouts  Gamma Radiation Energy Manipulation and Emission  Not usually a power associated with the Hulk  but there is enough evidence that Hulk possesses at least a limited ability to manipulate forms of energy  particularly gamma radiation  The Hulk s body works like a  gamma battery  by creating and radiating gamma energy 53   Armageddon once wanted to use Hulk s own energy to power machines capable of bringing his son back to life  However  the Hulk outsmarted him by consciously force feeding his own energy into the machines at a rate too fast for them to handle and they promptly overloaded and exploded 220   He also generated massive amounts of gamma energy during World War Hulk 146   The extent to which Hulk controls his own energy  and foreign sources of energy  is yet to be determined  Power Grids Official Ratings 221  Intelligence 6  Strength 7  Speed  3 Durability 7  Energy Projection  1

measured by any known intelligence test  224   According to Banner  he s one of the eight smartest people on the planet  When Banner is the Hulk  Banner s consciousness is buried within the Hulk s  and can influence the Hulk s behavior only to a very limited extent Strength level Class 100    the Hulk is one of the physically strongest beings ever to walk the earth  He possesses vast superhuman strength enabling him to lift  press  far in excess of 100 tons easily  In human form Bruce Banner possesses the normal human strength of a man of his age  height  and build who engages in no regular exercise Weaknesses Adamantium and vibranium has been shown capable of piercing the Hulk s skin  in World War Hulk  Wolverine  X 23  and Black Panther s claws could pierce it  ParaphernaliaEdit Equipment After his recent reprieve from the Hulk at the hands of the Red Hulk Banner has been showing a lot more of his intelligence  This has resulted in a bunch of gadgets that he carries around on his person called his Bannertech  Banner has a mobile operating system that he can hack sophisticated systems with in moments and seems to be controlled mentally for the most part  Banner has created a gamma and old power fueled shield that protects him from most physical harm  It has been show to protect him from beings as strong as Skaar and the Juggernaut  Banner is able to extend this shield to cover several other people and also redirect the energy to increase his strength so he can lift up to 10 tons  Banner has a pocket teleporter in his satchel with which he can reach into his bag and grab things from his lab  A host of scanners that are constantly scanning everyone within 50 feet of him  He also can send out a spy bot that can perform advanced bioscans  Banner used to sew a survival kit into his pants so whenever he woke up  he could survive anywhere  The kit included a needle and thread  a pack of waterproof matches  and a debit card 176  Transportation Banner recently reverse engineered the Leader s teleportation technology and uses that as transportation Weapons Old powered taser  It s so strong its effects are measured on the Richter Scale  At a 1 4 it was able to send Logan clear across the street and according to Banner on a 6 9 it would be able to kill him  Hammer of Nul NotesEdit Banner s identity is publicly known  however  the public does not know Joe Fixit was the Hulk  Bruce Banner is a graduate of Desert State University in Navapo  New Mexico 82    His college roommate was Peter Corbeau 103   Bruce Banner is of French descent  He had an ancestor who fought for France in World War I 86   Hulk was initially gray colored but as the gamma radiation raged through his body  was eventually turned green  The Hulk has reverted back to his gray skin tone a couple of times  Through the transformation from Banner to the Hulk  his jeans or pants are the only item of clothing to sustain the sheer forces in muscular explosion  TriviaEdit In Hulk  The Incredible Guide  Stan Lee revealed the Hulk was based on Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde as well as Frankenstein  Lou Ferrigno starred in the television series of the same name as the titular character opposite Bill Bixby who portrayed the Bruce Banner persona  Australian actor  Eric Bana  portrayed the Hulk in the 2003 film version directed by Ang Lee  Edward norton plays Bruce Banner in the 2008 reboot of  The Incredible Hulk  directed by Louis Leterrier  225  In the television series  Banner s first name was changed from Robert to David  On the DVD commentary of the pilot  series creator Kenneth Johnson explains that it was a way to honor his late son David  Also  according to Stan Lee  Universal changed the name because  Bruce Banner  sounded  in the eyes of the network  like a  gay character  name  and David sounded much better   Bruce  ultimately became the TV Banner s middle name  as it had been in the comics  It is visible on Banner s tombstone at the end of the pilot episode  Stan Lee never intended The Hulk s identity to be Robert Bruce Banner  Stan ran the first issues with Bruce Banner then mistakenly ran some more with Bob Banner  Notified of his mistake he announced the name of the Hulk s alter ego was Robert Bruce Banner  While the Hulk was intended to be the physically strongest character in Marvel  Stan Lee admitted that the creation of Thor was to make a character who was  stronger than the Hulk  and smarter than Reed Richards  in a godly wisdom aspect   The subject over which titular hero is the strongest is the source of many debates between comic book fans  The Professor personality was defined during writer Paul Jenkins  run as a  revelation  that the Merged Hulk was not actually a merger of the three personalities but rather a separate personality altogether  Unlike the Merged Hulk  the Professor was physically distinguished by having a pony tail  which the Merged Hulk did not  Jenkins justified this by retconning into the Hulk s continuity a new character named Angela Lipscomb  modeled after Jenkins  own girlfriend  who knew more about Bruce Banner than even Doc Samson  Lipscomb confronted Samson with her observations of the Professor and Doc Samson validated them  despite events presented in previous issues to the contrary  Appearances in Other MediaEdit Hulk  Toy  Toy Biz Marvel Legends Series 1 Series 1 Hulk Added by
