Dissociative identity disorder From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search Not to be confused with Dissocial personality disorder   Split personality  redirects here  For other uses  see Split personality  disambiguation   Dissociative Identity Disorder Classification and external resources ICD 10 F44 8 ICD 9 300 14 MeSH D009105 Dissociative identity disorder  DID  also known as multiple personality disorder in the ICD 10 1   is a psychiatric diagnosis whose essential feature  according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  DSM       is the presence of two or more distinct identities or personality states   that recurrently take control of behavior   2  The diagnosis requires that at least two personalities  one may be the host  routinely take control of the individual s behavior with an associated memory loss that goes beyond normal forgetfulness  in addition  symptoms cannot be the temporary effects of drug use or a general medical condition  3  Memory loss will occur in those with DID when an alternate part of the personality becomes dominant  DID is less common than other dissociative disorders  occurring in approximately 10  of dissociative disorder cases 4  and 1  of the general population  5  Diagnosis is often difficult as there is considerable co morbidity with other conditions and many symptoms overlap with other types of mental illness  2  It is diagnosed significantly more frequently in North America than in the rest of the world  6  7  Individuals diagnosed with DID frequently report severe physical and sexual abuse as a child  2  The etiology of DID has been attributed to the experience of pathological levels of stress which disrupts normal functioning and forces some memories  thoughts and aspects of personality from consciousness  8  9  though an alternative explanation is that dissociated identities are the iatrogenic effect of certain psychotherapeutic practices or increased popular interest  10  11  12  13  14  The debate between the two positions is characterised by passionate disagreement  10  12  13  15  16  Contents 1 Signs and symptoms 2 Causes 2 1

of Mental Disorders criteria for DID include the presence of two or more distinct identities or personality states  at least two of which take control of the individual s behavior on a recurrent basis  accompanied by inability to recall personal information beyond what is expected through normal forgetfulness  The diagnosis excludes symptoms caused by alcohol  drugs or medications and other medical conditions such as complex partial seizures and normal fantasy play in children  2  The DSM diagnostic criteria has been criticized as focusing solely on amnesia and alternate identities instead of the wide range of symptoms present in those diagnosed  17  In addition to the unique characteristics of multiple personality states with amnesia  the full syndrome of DID includes an array of pathological dissociative symptomatology as well as many symptoms resembling other mental illnesses  17  18  Daily functioning can vary from severely impaired to normal to high  19  Symptoms can include  17  Current memory loss of everyday events Depersonalization Depression Derealization Disruption of identity characterized by two or more distinct personality states Distortion or loss of subjective time Flashbacks of abuse trauma Frequent panic anxiety attacks Identity confusion Mood swings 18  Multiple mannerisms  attitudes and beliefs Paranoia 20  Pseudoseizures or other conversion symptoms Psychotic like symptoms such as hearing voices and other Schneiderian first rank symptoms Self alteration  feeling as if one s body belongs to someone else  Somatic symptoms that vary across identities Sudden anger without a justified cause Spontaneous trance states Suicidal and para suicidal behaviors  such as self injury  18  21  Unexplainable phobias Severe and or chronic intrusive dissociative symptoms can be very disturbing and may make sufferers question their sanity  17  Co morbid mental illnesses are the rule rather than the exception in all dissociative disorder cases  with 82  of DID patients being diagnosed with at least one DSM Axis I diagnosis in their lifetime  18  20  Common Axis I co morbidities include anxiety disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder  up to 80    social phobia  up to 75    panic disorder  54 70   and obsessive compulsive disorder  up to 64    mood disorders such as major depressive disorder  88 97    substance related disorders  50 65    eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa  19 23 1    and somatoform disorders  23 1 45 5    18  22  In addition  a majority of those diagnosed with DID meet the criteria for borderline personality disorder  23  a significant minority meet the criteria for avoidant personality disorder  and other personality disorders are not uncommon  20  Contrary to what would be expected by the presence of Schneiderian first rank symptoms  dissociative disorders only rarely appear in co morbidity with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders  Studies have shown that DID patients are diagnosed with five to 7 3 co morbid disorders on average   much higher than other mental illnesses  18  23  Despite research on DID including structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging  positron emission tomography  single photon emission computed tomography  event related potential and electroencephalography  no convergent neuroimaging findings have been identified regarding DID  making it difficult to hypothesize a biological basis for DID  In addition  many of the studies that do exist were performed from an explicitly trauma based position  and did not consider the possibility of iatrogenic induction of DID  There is no research to date regarding the neuroimaging and introduction of false memories in DID patients  15  Studies have shown differences between cerebral blood flow  24  changes in visual parameters  25  and support for amnesia between alters  8  15  DID patients also appear to show deficiencies in tests of conscious control of attention and memorization  which also showed signs of compartmentalization for implicit memory between alters but no such compartmentalization for verbal memory  and increased and persistent vigilance and startle responses to sound  DID patients may also demonstrate altered neuroanatomy  23  The concept of  alters  or  alternate personality  is the distinguishing characteristic of DID  21  The terms and their meanings are not well defined 8  though a distinction has been drawn between an  ego state   behaviors and experiences united by a common principle but possessing permeable boundaries with other such states  and alters  which have a separate autobiographical memory  independent initiative and sense of ownership over their own actions   23   edit  Causes  edit  Developmental trauma Those who accept the validity of DID as a diagnosis attribute it to extremes of stress or disorders of attachment  What may be expressed as posttraumatic stress disorder in adults may become DID when found in children  possibly due to their greater use of imagination as a form of coping  A specific relationship of childhood abuse  disorganized attachment and lack of social support are thought to be a necessary component of DID  along with a rigid parenting style  temperament  genetic predisposition and an inversion of the parent child relationship  23  Other suggested explanations include insufficient childhood nurturing combined with the innate ability of children in general to dissociate memories or experiences from consciousness  19  A high percentage of patients report child abuse 26  27  and others report an early loss  serious medical illness or other traumatic events  19  People diagnosed with DID often report that they have experienced severe physical and sexual abuse  especially during early to mid childhood  28  They also report more historical psychological trauma than those diagnosed with any other mental illness  21  Several psychiatric rating scales of DID sufferers suggested that DID is strongly related to childhood trauma rather than to an underlying electrophysiological dysfunction  29  In early childhood  children are still developing a personality structure that allows integrative functioning  Trauma greatly interferes with the development of integrative metacognitive functions and associative pathways between naturally developing ego states  enforcing separation instead of diffuse and inclusive functioning  30  Repeated activation of trauma related dissociative states  while the myelin in the hippocampus is still being formed  conditions the brain to function state dependently and form dissociative identities  31  32  Severe sexual  physical  or psychological trauma in childhood by a primary caregiver has been proposed as an explanation for the development of DID  In this theory  awareness  memories and feelings of a harmful action or event caused by the caregiver is pushed into the subconscious and dissociation becomes a coping mechanism for the individual during times of stress  These memories and feelings are later experienced as a separate entity  and if this happens multiple times  multiple alters are created  33  Psychiatrists August Piper and Harold Merskey have challenged the trauma hypothesis  arguing that correlation does not imply causation   the fact that DID patients report childhood trauma does not mean trauma causes DID   and point to the rareness of the diagnosis before 1980 as well as a failure to find DID as an outcome in longitudinal studies of traumatized children  They assert that DID cannot be accurately diagnosed because of vague and unclear diagnostic criteria in the DSM and undefined concepts such as  personality state  and  identities   and question the evidence for childhood abuse in patients beyond self reports  the lack of definition of what would indicate a threshold of abuse sufficient to induce DID and the extremely small number of cases of children diagnosed with DID despite an average age of appearance of the first alter of three years  16  Psychiatrist Colin Ross disagrees with Piper and Merskey s conclusion that DID cannot be accurately diagnosed  pointing to internal consistency between different structured dissociative disorder interviews  including the Dissociative Experiences Scale  Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule and Structured Clinical Interview for Dissociative Disorders  8  that are in the internal validity range of widely accepted mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and major depressive disorder  In his opinion  Piper and Merskey are setting the standard of proof higher than they are for other diagnoses  He also asserts that Piper and Merskey have cherry picked data and not incorporated all relevant scientific literature available  such as independent corroborating evidence of trauma in some patients  34   edit  Iatrogenesis It has been suggested that symptoms of DID may be created iatrogenically by therapists using techniques to  recover  memories with suggestible patients  10  12  16  The characteristics of patients diagnosed with DID  hypnotizability  suggestibility  frequent fantasization and mental absorption  contributed to these concerns and concerns regarding the validity of recovered memories  14  Skeptics believe that a small subset of doctors are responsible for diagnosing the majority of individuals with DID  12  16  Psychologist Nicholas Spanos and others skeptical of the condition have suggested that in addition to iatrogenesis  DID may be the result of role playing rather than separate personalities  though others disagree  pointing to a lack of incentive to manufacture or maintain separate personalities and point to the claimed histories of abuse of these patients  13  Piper and Merskey list a variety of arguments for the iatrogenic position  including the lack of children diagnosed with DID  the sudden spike in incidence after 1980 in the absence of evidence of greater rates of child abuse  the appearance of the disorder almost exclusively in individuals undergoing psychotherapy  particularly involving hypnosis   an increase in the number of alters over time and the changes in the identity of alters  such as those claiming to be animals or mythological creatures   16  The iatrogenic position is strongly linked to ideas about false memories  There is little consensus between the iatrogenic and traumagenic positions regarding DID and debates are both passionate and diametrically opposed  15   edit  Diagnosis The diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder is defined by criteria in the American Psychiatric Association s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  DSM   The DSM II used the term multiple personality disorder  the DSM III grouped the diagnosis with the other four major dissociative disorders  and the DSM IV TR categorizes it as dissociative identity disorder  2  Dissociation is recognized as a symptomatic presentation in response to psychological trauma  extreme emotional stress  and  as noted  in association with emotional dysregulation and borderline personality disorder  35  The ICD 10 continues to list the condition as multiple personality disorder  1  The diagnosis has been criticized  researchers Piper and Merskey describe it as a culture bound and often iatrogenic condition which they believe is in decline  10  16  The diagnostic criteria in section 300 14  dissociative disorders  of the DSM IV require that an adult  for non physiological reasons  be recurrently controlled by multiple discrete identity or personality states while also suffering extensive memory lapses  36  While otherwise similar  the diagnostic criteria for children requires also ruling out fantasy  Diagnosis is normally performed by a therapist  psychiatrist or psychologist clinically trained in the specific material who may use specially designed interviews  such as the SCID D  and personality assessment tools to evaluate a person for a dissociative disorder  37  Subjectivity in terms like personality  ego state  identity and amnesia grants a certain degree of subjectivity to diagnosis  8  The psychiatric history of individuals diagnosed with DID frequently but not always contains multiple previous diagnoses of various mental disorders and treatment failures  18  37  It has been suggested that this can be attributed to the large number of co morbid conditions that often accompany and can mask the underlying diagnosis of DID  18   edit  Proposed changes to diagnostic criteria in the DSM 5 The proposed diagnostic criteria for DID in the DSM 5 is  38  Disruption of identity characterized by two or more distinct personality states  one can be the host  or an experience of possession  as evidenced by discontinuities in sense of self  cognition  behavior  affect  perceptions  and or memories  This disruption may be observed by others  or reported by the patient  Inability to recall important personal information  for everyday events or traumatic events  that is inconsistent with ordinary forgetfulness  Causes clinically significant distress and impairment in social  occupational  or other important areas of functioning  The disturbance is not a normal part of a broadly accepted cultural or religious practice and is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance  e g   blackouts or chaotic behavior during alcohol intoxication  or a general medical condition  e g   complex partial seizures   NOTE  In children  the symptoms are not attributable to imaginary playmates or other fantasy play  These specifiers are under consideration  a  With pseudoseizures or other conversion symptoms b  With somatic symptoms that vary across identities The proposed Criterion C is intended to  help differentiate normative cultural experiences from psychopathology   This phrase  which occurs in several other diagnostic criteria  is proposed for inclusion in 300 14 as part of a proposed merger of dissociative trance disorder with DID  For example  professionals would be able to take shamanism  which involves voluntary possession trance states  into consideration  and not have to diagnose those who report it as having a mental disorder  39  40   edit  Screening Perhaps due to their perceived rarity  the dissociative disorders  including DID  were not initially included in the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV  SCID   which is designed to make psychiatric diagnoses more rigorous and reliable  8  Instead  shortly after the publication of the initial SCID a freestanding protocol for dissociative disorders  SCID D  41  was published  8  This interview takes about 30 to 90 minutes depending on the subject s experiences  42  An alternative diagnostic instrument  the Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule  also exists but the SCID D is generally considered superior  8  The Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule  DDIS  43  is a highly structured interview that discriminates among various DSM IV diagnoses  The DDIS can usually be administered in 30 45 minutes  44  Other questionnaires include the Dissociative Experiences Scale  DES   Perceptual Alterations Scale  Questionnaire on Experiences of Dissociation  Dissociation Questionnaire and the Mini SCIDD  All are strongly intercorrelated and except the Mini SCIDD  all incorporate absorption  a normal part of personality involving narrowing or broadening of attention  8  The DES 45  is a simple  quick  and validated 46  questionnaire that has been widely used to screen for dissociative symptoms  with variations for children and adolescents  Tests such as the DES provide a quick method of screening subjects so that the more time consuming structured clinical interview can be used in the group with high DES scores  Depending on where the cutoff is set  people who would subsequently be diagnosed can be missed  An early recommended cutoff was 15 20  47  The reliability of the DES in non clinical samples has been questioned  48   edit  Differential diagnoses Due to overlap between symptoms  differential diagnosis between DID and a variety of other conditions  including schizophrenia  psychosis  normal and rapid cycling bipolar disorder  anxiety disorders  somatization and personality disorders  can be complicated as delusions or auditory hallucinations can be mistaken for speech by other personalities and vice versa  or sudden behavior changes being attributed to sudden mood fluctuations  Persistence and consistency of identities and behavior  amnesia  measures of dissociation or hypnotizability and reports from family members or other associates indicating a history of such changes can help distinguish DID from other conditions  A diagnosis of DID takes precedence over any other dissociative disorders  Distinguishing true DID from malingering is a concern when financial or legal gains are an issue  and factitious disorder may also be considered if there patient has a history or pattern help or attention seeking  Individuals who state that their symptoms are due to external spirits or entities entering their bodies are generally diagnosed with dissociative disorder not otherwise specified rather than DID due to the lack of internal personalities or alter states  2  Most individuals who enter an emergency department and are unaware of their names are generally in a psychotic state rather dissociative  Auditory hallucinations are common  but complex visual hallucinations may also occur  23  Conditions which may be present with similar symptoms include borderline personality disorder  and the dissociative conditions of dissociative amnesia and dissociative fugue  49  The clearest distinction is the lack of discrete formed personalities in these conditions  Individuals with schizophrenia will have some form of delusions  hallucinations or thought disorder  49  The condition may be under diagnosed due to skepticism and lack of awareness from mental health professionals  made difficult due to the lack of specific and reliable criteria for diagnosing DID as well as a lack of prevalence rates due to the failure to examine systematically selected and representative populations  12  50  A specific relationship between DID and borderline personality disorder has been posited several times  with various clinicians noting significant overlap between symptoms and patient behaviors and it has been suggested that DID may arise  from a substrate of borderline traits   Reviews of DID patients and their medical records concluded that the majority of those diagnosed with DID would also meet the criteria for either borderline personality disorder or more generally borderline personality  23   edit  Treatment There is a general lack of consensus in the diagnosis and treatment of DID  15  Common treatment methods include an eclectic mix of psychotherapy techniques  including cognitive behavioral  CBT   4  23  insight oriented therapies  8 dialectical behavioral therapy  DBT   hypnotherapy and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing  EMDR   Medications can be used for co morbid disorders and or targeted symptom relief  14  32  Some behavior therapists initially use behavioral treatments such as only responding to a single identity  and then use more traditional therapy once a consistent response is established  51  Brief treatment due to managed care may be difficult  as individuals diagnosed with DID may have unusual difficulties in trusting a therapist and take a prolonged period to form a comfortable therapeutic alliance  32  Regular contact  weekly or biweekly  is more common  and treatment generally lasts years   not weeks or months  23  32  Therapy for DID is phase oriented  Different alters may appear based on their greater ability to deal with specific situational stresses or threats  While some patients may initially present with a large number of alters  this number may reduce during treatment   though it is considered important for the therapist to become familiar with at least the more prominent personality states as the  host  personality may not be the  true  identity of the patient  Specific alters may react negatively to therapy  fearing the therapists goal is to eliminate the alter  particularly those associated with illegal or violent activities   A more realistic and appropriate goal of treatment is to integrate adaptive responses to abuse  injury or other threats into the overall personality structure  23  The International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation has published guidelines 32  to phase oriented treatment in adults as well as children and adolescents that are widely used in the field of DID treatment  52  53  54  55  The first phase of therapy focuses on symptoms and relieving the distressing aspects of the condition  ensuring the safety of the individual  improving the patient s capacity to form and maintain healthy relationships  and improving general daily life functioning  Co morbid disorders such as substance abuse and eating disorders are addressed in this phase of treatment  32  The second phase focuses on stepwise exposure to traumatic memories and prevention of re dissociation  The final phase focuses on reconnecting the identities of disparate alters into a single functioning identity with all its memories and experiences intact  32  Movement through the phases is often non linear  patients in the second or third phase of treatment may need to go back to a previous phase to maintain safety and or process previously unprocessed material  56   edit  Prognosis DID does not resolve spontaneously  and symptoms vary over time  Individuals with primarily dissociative symptoms and features of post traumatic stress disorder normally recover with treatment  Those with co morbid addictions  personality  mood  or eating disorders face a longer  slower  and more complicated recovery process  Individuals still attached to abusers face the poorest prognosis  treatment may be long term and consist solely of symptom relief rather than personality integration  Changes in identity  loss of memory  and awaking in unexplained locations and situations often leads to chaotic personal lives  19  Individuals with the condition commonly attempt suicide  57  58   edit  Epidemiology The DSM does not provide an estimate of incidence for DID and dissociative disorders were excluded from the Epidemiological Catchment Area Project  As a result  there are no national statistics for incidence and prevalence of DID in the United States  8  Initially DID along with the rest of the dissociative disorders were considered the rarest of psychological conditions  numbering less than 100 by 1944  with only one further case added in the next two decades  In the late 1970s and 80s  the number of diagnoses rose sharply  Accompanying this rise was an increase in the number of alters  rising from only the primary and one alter personality in most cases  to an average of 13 in the mid 1980s  the increase in both number of cases and number of alters within each case are both factors in professional skepticism regarding the diagnosis   8  A possible explanation for the increase in incidence and prevalence of DID over time is that the condition was misdiagnosed as schizophrenia  bipolar disorder  or other such disorders in the past  another explanation is that an increase in awareness of DID and child sexual abuse has led to earlier  more accurate diagnosis  Others explain the increase as being due to the use of inappropriate therapeutic techniques in highly suggestible individuals  though this is itself controversial  12  13  Figures

representation in North America DID is a controversial diagnosis and condition  with much of the literature on DID still being generated and published in North America  to the extent that it was once regarded as a phenomenon confined to that continent 7  10  though research has appeared discussing the appearance of DID in other countries and cultures  73  In a 1996 review  6  Joel Paris offered three possible causes for the sudden increase in people diagnosed with DID  The result of therapist suggestions to suggestible people  much as Charcot s hysterics acted in accordance with his expectations  Psychiatrists  past failure to recognize dissociation being redressed by new training and knowledge  Dissociative phenomena are actually increasing  but this increase only represents a new form of an old and protean entity   hysteria   Paris believes that the first possible cause is the most likely  In a 2011 publication  Vedat Sar postulated other possible causes for the apparent differences in the prevalence of DID and other dissociative disorders  including different preferences in diagnostic instruments  cultural differences in the interpretation of presenting symptoms  differences in mental health care systems and differences in the frequency of overall mental health treatment seeking behavior around the world  21   edit  History One of ten photogravure portraits of Louis Viv  published in Variations de la personnalit  by Bourru and Burot  Before the 19th century  people exhibiting symptoms similar to those were believed to be possessed  57  The first case of DID was thought to be described by Paracelsus in 1646  74  An intense interest in spiritualism  parapsychology  and hypnosis continued throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries  7  running in parallel with John Locke s views that there was an association of ideas requiring the coexistence of feelings with awareness of the feelings  75 Hypnosis  which was pioneered in the late 18th century by Franz Mesmer and Armand Marie Jacques de Chastenet  Marques de Puys gur  challenged Locke s association of ideas  Hypnotists reported what they thought were second personalities emerging during hypnosis and wondered how two minds could coexist  7  The 19th century saw a number of reported cases of multiple personalities which Rieber 75  estimated would be close to 100  Epilepsy was seen as a factor in some cases  75  and discussion of this connection continues into the present era  76  77  By the late 19th century there was a general acceptance that emotionally traumatic experiences could cause long term disorders which might display a variety of symptoms  78  These conversion disorders were found to occur in even the most resilient individuals  but with profound effect in someone with emotional instability like Louis Viv   1863    who suffered a traumatic experience as a 13 year old when he encountered a viper  Viv  was the subject of countless medical papers and became the most studied case of dissociation in the 19th century  Between 1880 and 1920  many great international medical conferences devoted a lot of time to sessions on dissociation  79  It was in this climate that Jean Martin Charcot introduced his ideas of the impact of nervous shocks as a cause for a variety of neurological conditions  One of Charcot s students  Pierre Janet  took these ideas and went on to develop his own theories of dissociation  80  One of the first individuals diagnosed with multiple personalities to be scientifically studied was Clara Norton Fowler  under the pseudonym Christine Beauchamp  American neurologist Morton Prince studied Fowler between 1898 and 1904  describing her case study in his 1906 monograph  Dissociation of a Personality  80  In the early 20th century interest in dissociation and multiple personalities waned for a number of reasons  After Charcot s death in 1893  many of his so called hysterical patients were exposed as frauds  and Janet s association with Charcot tarnished his theories of dissociation  7 Sigmund Freud recanted his earlier emphasis on dissociation and childhood trauma  7  Plaque on the former house of Pierre Marie F lix Janet  1859 1947   the philosopher and psychologist who first drew a connection between events in the subject s past life and present mental health  also coining the words  dissociation  and  subconscious  In 1910  Eugen Bleuler introduced the term schizophrenia to replace dementia praecox  A review of the Index medicus from 1903 through 1978 showed a dramatic decline in the number of reports of multiple personality after the diagnosis of schizophrenia became popular  especially in the United States  81  A number of factors helped create a large climate of skepticism and disbelief  paralleling the increased suspicion of DID was the decline of interest in dissociation as a laboratory and clinical phenomenon  79  Starting in about 1927  there was a large increase in the number of reported cases of schizophrenia  which was matched by an equally large decrease in the number of multiple personality reports  79  Bleuler also included multiple personality in his category of schizophrenia  It was concluded in the 1980s that DID patients are often misdiagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia  79  The public  however  was exposed to psychological ideas which took their interest  Mary Shelley s Frankenstein  Robert Louis Stevenson s Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde  and many short stories by Edgar Allan Poe had a formidable impact  75  In 1957  with the publication of the book The Three Faces of Eve and the popular movie which followed it  the American public s interest in multiple personality was revived  During the 1970s an initially small number of clinicians campaigned to have it considered a legitimate diagnosis  79  Between 1968 and 1980 the term that was used for dissocative identity disorder was  Hysterical neurosis  dissociative type   The APA wrote in the second edition of the DSM   In the dissociative type  alterations may occur in the patient s state of consciousness or in his identity  to produce such symptoms as amnesia  somnambulism  fugue  and multiple personality   82  The number of cases sharply increased in the late 1970s and throughout the 80s  and the first scholarly monographs on the topic appeared in 1986  8  In 1974 the highly influential book Sybil was published  and later made into a miniseries in 1976 and again in 2007  Describing what Robert Rieber called  the third most famous of multiple personality cases   83  it presented a detailed discussion of the problems of treatment of  Sybil   a pseudonym for Shirley Ardell Mason  Though the book and subsequent films helped popularize the diagnosis  later analysis of the case suggested different interpretations  ranging from Mason s problems being iatrogenically induced through therapeutic methods or an inadvertent hoax due in part to the lucrative publishing rights  83  84  though this conclusions has itself been challenged  85  As media attention on DID increased  so too did the controversy surrounding the diagnosis  74  With the publication of the DSM III  which omitted the terms  hysteria  and  neurosis   and thus the former categories for dissociative disorders   dissociative diagnoses became  orphans  with their own categories 86  with dissociative identity disorder appearing as  multiple personality disorder   8  In the opinion of McGill University psychiatrist Joel Paris  this inadvertently legitimized them by forcing textbooks  which mimicked the structure of the DSM  to include a separate chapter on them and resulted in an increase in diagnosis of dissociative conditions  Once a rarely occurring spontaneous phenomena  research in 1944 showed only 76 cases   87  became  an artifact of bad  or na ve  psychotherapy  as patients capable of dissociating were accidentally encouraged to express their symptoms by  overly fascinated  therapists  86   Interpersonality amnesia  was removed as a diagnostic feature from the DSM III in 1987  which may have contributed to the increasing frequency of the diagnosis  8  There were 200 reported cases of DID as of 1980  and 20 000 from 1980 to 1990  88 Joan Acocella reports that 40 000 cases were diagnosed from 1985 to 1995  89  Scientific publications regarding DID peaked in the mid 1990s then rapidly declined  90  In 1994  the fourth edition of the DSM replaced the criteria again and changed the name of the condition from  multiple personality disorder  to the current  dissociative identity disorder  to emphasize the importance of changes to consciousness and identity rather than personality  The inclusion of interpersonality amnesia helped to distinguish DID from dissociative disorder not otherwise specified  but the condition retains an inherent subjectivity due to difficulty in defining terms such as personality  identity  ego state and even amnesia  8  The ICD 10 still classifies DID as a  Dissociative  conversion  disorder  and retains the name  multiple personality disorder  with the classification number of F44 8 81  1  A 2006 study compared scholarly research and publications on DID and dissociative amnesia to other mental health conditions  such as anorexia nervosa  alcohol abuse and schizophrenia from 1984 to 2003  The results were found to be unusually distributed  with a very low level of publications in the 1980s followed by a significant rise that peaked in the mid 1990s and subsequently rapidly declined in the decade following  Compared to 25 other diagnosis  the mid 90 s  bubble  of publications regarding DID was unique  In the opinion of the authors of the review  the publication results suggest a period of  fashion  that waned  and that the two diagnoses   did  not command widespread scientific acceptance   90   edit  Society and culture Robert Louis Stevenson s Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is known for its portrayal of a split personality and has become synonymous with multiple personalities in both lay and scientific literature 91  Main article  Dissociative identity disorder in popular culture Despite its rareness  DID is portrayed with remarkable frequency in popular culture  producing or appearing in numerous books  films and television shows  13  Psychiatrist Colin A  Ross has stated that based on documents obtained through freedom of information legislation  psychiatrists linked to Project MKULTRA claimed to be able to deliberately induce dissociative identity disorder using a variety of aversive techniques  92  Surveys of the attitudes of Canadian and American psychiatrists  attitudes towards dissociative disorders completed in 1999 11  and 2001 93  found considerable skepticism and disagreement regarding the research base of dissociative disorders in general and DID in specific  as well as whether the inclusion DID in the DSM was appropriate   edit  Legal issues Within legal circles  DID has been described as one of the most disputed psychiatric diagnoses and forensic assessments  15  The number of court cases involving DID has increased substantially since the 1990s 94  and the diagnosis presents a variety of challenges for legal systems  Courts must distinguish individuals who mimic symptoms of DID for legal or social reasons  Within jurisprudence there are three significant problems  15  Individuals diagnosed with DID may accuse others of abuse but lack objective evidence and base their accusations solely on regular or recovered memories  There are questions regarding the civil and political rights of alters  particularly which alter can legally represent the person  sign a contract or vote  Finally  individuals diagnosed with DID who are accused of crimes may deny culpability due to the crime being committed by a different identity state  In cases where not guilty by reason of insanity is used as a defence in a court  it is normally accompanied by one of three legal approaches   claiming a specific alter was in control when the crime was committed  and if that alter is considered insane   deciding whether all  or which  alters may be insane  or whether only the dominant personality meets the insanity standard  74  There is no agreement within the legal and mental health fields whether an individual can be acquitted due to a diagnosis of DID  It has been argued that any individual with DID is a single person with a serious mental illness and therefore exhibits diminished responsibility and this was first recognized in an American court in 1978  State v  Milligan   However  public reaction to the result of the case was strongly negative and since that time the few cases claiming insanity have found that the altered consciousness found in DID is either irrelevant or the diagnosis was not admissible evidence  74  The self reported nature of the symptoms used to reach a diagnosis makes it difficult to determine their credibility  although objective measuring of brain activation and structural patterns are a promising direction for future scientific research into distinguishing malingered from genuine DID in forensic settings  15  Forensic experts called on to conduct forensic examinations for DID must use a multidisciplinary approach including multiple screening instruments  74   edit  See also Psychology portal Psychiatry portal Complex post traumatic stress disorder Defense mechanisms Dissociative disorder not otherwise specified Fugue state
