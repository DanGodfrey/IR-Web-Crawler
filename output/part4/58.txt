Soap opera From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search For other uses  see Soap opera  disambiguation   A soap opera  sometimes called  soap  for short  is an ongoing  episodic work of dramatic fiction presented in serial format on radio or as television programming  The name soap opera stems from the original dramatic serials broadcast on radio that had soap manufacturers  such as Procter  amp  Gamble  Colgate Palmolive and Lever Brothers  as sponsors 1  and producers  2  These early radio series were broadcast in weekday daytime slots  usually five days a week  when most listeners would be housewives  thus the shows were aimed at and consumed by a predominantly female audience  1  A crucial element that defines soap opera is the open ended nature of the narrative  with stories spanning several episodes  The defining feature that makes a television program a soap opera  according to Albert Moran  is  that form of television that works with a continuous open narrative  Each episode ends with a promise that the storyline is to be continued in another episode   3  Soap opera stories run concurrently  intersect and lead into further developments  An individual episode of a soap opera will generally switch between several different concurrent story threads that may at times interconnect and affect one another or may run entirely independent of each other  Each episode may feature some of the show s current storylines but not always all of them  Especially in daytime serials and those that are screened each weekday  there is some rotation of both storyline and actors so any given storyline or actor will appear in some but usually not all of a week s worth of episodes  Soap operas rarely bring all the current storylines to a conclusion at the same time  When one storyline ends there are several other story threads at differing stages of development  Soap opera episodes typically end on some sort of cliffhanger  and the Season Finale ends in the same way  only to be resolved when the show returns for the start of a new yearly broadcast  Evening soap operas and those that screen at a rate of one episode per week are more likely to feature the entire cast in each episode  and to represent all current storylines in each episode  Evening soap operas and serials that run for only part of the year tend to bring things to a dramatic end of season cliffhanger  In 1976  Time magazine described American daytime television as  TV s richest market   noting the loyalty of the soap opera fan base and the expansion of several half hour series to a full hour in order to maximize ad revenues  4  The article explained that at that time  many prime time series lost money  while daytime serials earned profits several times more than their production costs  4  The issue s cover notably featured its first daytime soap stars  Bill Hayes and Susan Seaforth Hayes of Days of our Lives  5  6  a couple whose onscreen and real life romance was widely covered by both the soap opera magazines and the mainstream press  7  Contents 1 Plots and storylines 2 United States 2 1 Daytime serials 2 1 1 Actors 2 1 2 Evolution of the daytime

family life  personal relationships  sexual dramas  emotional and moral conflicts  some coverage of topical issues  set in familiar domestic interiors with only occasional excursions into new locations   8  Fitting in with these characteristics  most soap operas follow the lives of a group of characters who live or work in a particular place  or focus on a large extended family  The storylines follow the day to day activities and personal relationships of these characters   Soap narratives  like those of film melodramas  are marked by what Steve Neale has described as  chance meetings  coincidences  missed meetings  sudden conversions  last minute rescues and revelations  deus ex machina endings    These elements may be found across the gamut of soap operas  from EastEnders to Dallas  9  In many soap operas  in particular daytime serials in the United States  the characters are frequently attractive  seductive  glamorous and wealthy  Soap operas from Australia and the United Kingdom tend to focus on more everyday characters and situations  and are frequently set in working class environments  10  Many Australian and UK soap operas explore social realist storylines such as family discord  marriage breakdown  or financial problems  Both UK and Australian soap operas feature comedy elements  often by way of affectionate comic stereotypes such as the gossip or the grumpy old man  presented as a sort of comic foil to the emotional turmoil that surrounds them  This diverges from US soap operas where such comedy is rare  3  UK soap operas frequently make a claim to presenting  reality  or purport to have a  realistic  style  11  UK soap operas also frequently foreground their geographic location as a key defining feature of the show while depicting and capitalising on the exotic appeal of the stereotypes connected to the location  So EastEnders focuses on the tough and grim life in London s east end  Coronation Street invokes Manchester and its characters exhibit the stereotypical characteristic of  Northern straight talking   12  Romance  secret relationships  extramarital affairs  and genuine love have been the basis for many soap opera storylines  In US daytime serials the most popular soap opera characters  and the most popular storylines  often involved a romance of the sort presented in paperback romance novels  Soap opera storylines sometimes weave intricate  convoluted  and sometimes confusing tales of characters who have affairs  meet mysterious strangers and fall in love  and who commit adultery  all of which keeps audiences hooked on the unfolding story twists  Crimes such as kidnapping  rape  and even murder may go unpunished if the perpetrator is to be retained in the ongoing story  Australian and UK soap operas also feature a significant proportion of romance storylines  In Russia  most popular serials explore the  romantic quality  of criminal and or oligarch life  In soap opera storylines  previously unknown children  siblings  and twins  including the evil variety  of established characters often emerge to upset and reinvigorate the set of relationships examined by the series  Unexpected calamities disrupt weddings  childbirths  and other major life events with unusual frequency  Much like comic books another popular form of linear storytelling pioneered in the US during the 20th Century a character s death is not guaranteed to be permanent  On The Bold and the Beautiful  Taylor Forrester  Hunter Tylo  was shown to flatline and have a funeral  When Tylo reprised the character in 2005 a retcon explained that Taylor had actually gone into a coma  Stunts and complex physical action are largely absent  especially from daytime serials  Such story events often take place offscreen and are referred to in dialogue instead of being shown  This is because stunts or action scenes are difficult to adequately depict visually without complex action  multiple takes  and post production editing  When episodes were broadcast live  post production work was impossible  Though all serials have long switched to being taped  extensive post production work and multiple takes  while possible  are not feasible due to the tight taping schedules and low budgets   edit  United States  edit  Daytime serials Publicity photo of Rosemary Prinz as Penny Hughes from As the World Turns  Soap operas became a staple of daytime television in the United States in the early 1950s  Along with game shows  reruns of situation comedies  and talk shows  the soap opera was traditionally a fixture in the American broadcast networks  daytime schedules  Many long running US soap operas established particular environments for their stories  The Doctors and General Hospital  in the beginning  told stories almost exclusively from inside the confines of a hospital  As the World Turns dealt heavily with Chris Hughes  law practice and the travails of his wife Nancy who  tired of being  the loyal housewife  in the 1970s  became one of the first older women on the American serials to become a working woman  Guiding Light dealt with Bert Bauer  Charita Bauer  and her alcoholic husband Bill  and their endless marital troubles  When Bert s status shifted to caring mother and town matriarch  her children s marital troubles were showcased  Search for Tomorrow mostly told its story through the eyes of Joanne Gardner  Mary Stuart   Even when stories revolved around other characters  Joanne was frequently a key player in their storylines  Days of our Lives initially focused on Dr  Tom Horton and his steadfast wife Alice  The show later branched out to focus more on their five children  The Edge of Night featured as its central character Mike Karr  a police detective  later an attorney   and largely dealt with organized crime  The Young and the Restless first focused on two families  the prosperous Brooks Family with four daughters  and the working class Foster family of a single working mother with three children  Its storylines explored realistic problems including cancer  mental illness  poverty and infidelity  In contrast  Dark Shadows  1966 1971  featured supernatural characters and dealt with fantasy and horror storylines  Its characters included the vampire Barnabas Collins  the witch Angelique  and various ghosts and goblins  both friendly and malevolent  The American soap opera Guiding Light started as a radio drama in January 1937 and subsequently transferred to television in June 1952  With the exception of several years in the late 1940s when Irna Phillips was in dispute with Procter  amp  Gamble  Guiding Light was heard or seen nearly every weekday since it began  making it the longest story ever told in a broadcast medium  Originally serials were broadcast as fifteen minute installments each weekday in daytime slots  In 1956 As the World Turns and The Edge of Night  both produced by Procter  amp  Gamble Productions  debuted as the first half hour soap operas on CBS Television  All soap operas broadcast half hour episodes by the end of the 1960s  With increased popularity in the 1970s most soap operas expanded to an hour in length by the end of the decade  Another World even expanded to ninety minutes for a short time   More than half of the serials had expanded to one hour episodes by 1980  As of 2010  five of the six US serials air one hour episodes each weekday  Only The Bold and the Beautiful airs 30 minute episodes  Soap operas were originally broadcast live from the studio  creating what many at the time regarded as a feeling similar to that of a stage play  As nearly all soap operas were originated at that time in New York  a number of soap actors were also accomplished stage actors who performed live theatre during breaks from their soap roles  In the 1960s and 1970s  new serials such as General Hospital  Days of our Lives  and The Young and the Restless were produced in Los Angeles  Their success made the West Coast a viable alternative to New York produced soap operas  which were becoming more costly to perform  By the early 1970s  nearly all soap operas had transitioned to being taped  As the World Turns and The Edge of Night were the last to make the switch  in 1975  Port Charles used the practice of running 13 week  story arcs   in which the main events of the arc are played out and wrapped up over the 13 weeks  although some storylines did continue over more than one arc  According to the 2006 Preview issue of Soap Opera Digest  it was briefly discussed that all ABC shows might do telenovela arcs  but this was rejected  Though US daytime soap operas are not generally rerun by their networks  occasionally they are rebroadcast elsewhere  Early episodes of Dark Shadows were rerun on PBS stations in the early 1970s after the show s cancellation  and the entire series  except the single missing episode  was rerun on the SciFi Channel in the 1990s  After The Edge of Night s 1984 cancellation  reruns of the show s final five years were shown on the USA Network s latenight schedule from 1985 to 1989  On January 20  2000 the SOAPnet network began retransmitting soap operas originally aired on ABC  NBC and CBS  Disney ABC announced that SOAPnet will cease operations at 11 59 PM  E T  P T   on March 22  2012  Newer broadcast networks since the late 1980s  such as Fox and cable television networks  have largely eschewed soap operas in their daytime schedules  instead running syndicated programming and reruns  No cable television outlet has produced its own daytime serial  although DirecTV s The 101 Network took over existing serial Passions  continuing production for one season  Fox  the fourth  major network   carried a short lived daytime soap Tribes in 1990  Yet other than this and a couple of pilot attempts  Fox mainly stayed away from daytime soaps  and has not attempted them since their ascension to major network status in 1994   They did attempt a series of daily prime time soaps  which aired on newly created sister network MyNetworkTV  but the experiment was largely a failure   Due to the masses of episodes produced for a series  release of soap operas to DVD  a popular venue for distribution of current and vintage television series  is considered impractical  With the exception of occasional specials  daytime soap operas are notable by their absence from DVD release schedules  an exception being the 1960s 70s supernatural soap opera  Dark Shadows  which did receive an almost complete release on both VHS and DVD    edit  Actors See List of longest serving soap opera actors Due to the longevity of these shows it is not uncommon for a single character to be played by multiple actors  The key character of Jill Foster Abbott on The Young and the Restless has been played by several different actresses  Conversely several actors have remained playing the same character for many years  Helen Wagner played Hughes family matriarch Nancy Hughes on American soap As the World Turns from its April 2  1956 debut through her death in May 2010  She is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records 13  as the actor with the longest uninterrupted performance in a single role  Fellow As the World Turns actors  Eileen Fulton and Don Hastings who played Lisa Grimaldi and Dr  Bob Hughes  respectively  played their roles nearly as long  both having joined the show in 1960  and remaining through the show s 2010 cancellation  William Roache has played Ken Barlow continuously from 1960 on the British soap Coronation Street  which is also the longest running soap in the world still in production  In Rachel Ames played Audrey Hardy in General Hospital from 1964 until 2007  and returned in 2009  Susan Lucci has played Erica Kane in All My Children since the show s debut in January 1970  Ray MacDonnell played Dr  Joe Martin in that series from the show s 1970 debut until 2010  Erika Slezak has played Victoria Lord on One Life to Live since 1971 and Jeanne Cooper has played Katherine Chancellor on The Young and the Restless since late 1973  Starting from the 2000s it had become increasingly common for long term regular cast members to be dropped from contract status to recurring status  a part of contract negotiations largely restricted to U S  soap operas  As recurring players they are paid only for those episodes in which they appear  this can be more cost effective for the series in the case of performers making sporadic or occasional appearances  Other actors have played several characters on different shows  Sharon Case  Genie Francis  Maura West  Eden Riegel  Billy Miller  Elizabeth Hendrickson  Marcy Rylan  Amelia Heinle Luckinbill  Sarah Brown  Laura Wright  Veleka Gray  Robin Mattson  Lenore Kasdorf  Roscoe Born  Judith Chapman  David Canary  and Michael Sabatino have all played multiple soap roles   edit  Evolution of the daytime serial For several decades most US daytime soap operas concentrated on family and marital discord  legal drama  and romance  The action rarely left interior settings  and many shows were set in fictional  medium sized Midwestern towns  Exterior shots  once a rarity  were slowly incorporated into the series Ryan s Hope  Unlike many earlier serials which were set in fictional towns  Ryan s Hope was set in real location  New York City  and outside shoots were used to give the series greater authenticity  The first exotic location shoot was made by All My Children  to St  Croix in 1978  Many other soap operas planned lavish storylines after the success of the All My Children shoot  P amp G produced soaps Another World and Guiding Light both went to St  Croix in 1980  the former show culminating a long running storyline between popular characters Mac  Rachel and Janice  and the latter to serve as an exotic setting for Alan Spaulding and Rita Bauer s torrid affair  Search for Tomorrow taped for two weeks in Hong Kong in 1981  Later that year some of the cast and crew ventured to Jamaica to tape a love consummation storyline between Garth and Kathy  During the 1980s  perhaps as a reaction to the evening drama series that were gaining high ratings  daytime serials began to incorporate action and adventure storylines  more big business intrigue  and an increased emphasis on youthful romance  Serials also focused on developing supercouples  One of the first and most popular supercouples was Luke Spencer and Laura Webber in General Hospital  Luke and Laura helped to attract both male and female fans  Even Elizabeth Taylor was a fan and at her own request was given a guest role in Luke and Laura s wedding episode  Luke and Laura s popularity led to other soap producers striving to reproduce this success by attempting to create supercouples of their own  With increasingly bizarre action storylines coming into vogue Luke and Laura saved the world from being frozen  brought a mobster down by finding his black book in a Left Handed Boy Statue  and helped a Princess find her Aztec Treasure in Mexico  Other soap operas attempted similar adventure storylines  often featuring footage shot on location   frequently in exotic locales  During the 1990s  the mob  action  and adventure stories fell out of favor with producers due to generally declining ratings for daytime soap operas at the time  and the resultant budget cuts  In the 1990s soap operas were no longer able to go on expensive location shoots overseas as they had in the 1980s  In the 1990s soap operas increasingly focused on younger characters and social issues  such as Erica Kane s drug addiction on All My Children  the re emergence of Viki Lord s Multiple Personality Disorder on One Life to Live  Katherine Chancellor s alcoholism on The Young and the Restless and Stone and Robin dealing with AIDS and death on General Hospital  Other social issues included cancer  homophobia  and racism  Some shows of the 2000s incorporated supernatural and science fiction elements into their storylines  One of the main characters in US soap opera Passions is Tabitha Lenox  a 300 year old witch  Port Charles has featured vampires and an angel  Frequently these characters are isolated to one of the ongoing story threads to allow a fan to ignore them if they do not like that element   edit  Traditional grammar of daytime serials Modern U S  daytime soap operas largely stay true to the original soap opera format  The duration and format of storylines and the visual grammar employed by US daytime serials set them apart from soap operas in other countries and from evening soap operas  Stylistically  UK and Australian soap operas  which are usually produced for early evening timeslots  fall somewhere in between US daytime and evening soap operas  Similar to US daytime soap operas  UK and Australian serials are shot on videotape  and the cast and storylines are rotated across the week s episodes so that each cast member will appear in some but not all episodes  UK and Australian soap operas move through storylines at a faster rate than daytime serials  making them closer to US evening soap operas in this regard  American daytime soap operas feature stylistic elements that set them apart from other shows  A construct unique to US daytime serials is the format where the action will cut between various conversations  returning to each at the precise moment it was left  This is the most significant distinction between US daytime soap operas and other forms of US television drama  which generally allow for narrative time to pass  off screen  between the scenes depicted  3  In US daytime soap operas scenes often end with a pregnant pause and a close up on the character  There will be no dialogue for several seconds while the music builds before cutting to a commercial or a new scene  This kind of segue is referred to in the industry as a  tag   The traditional three point lighting set up routinely used in filmmaking and television production is also used on daytime soap operas  sometimes with accentuated back lighting to lift actors out of the background  This is useful in programs like soap operas which are shot on videotape in small interior sets  The backlight is frequently more subtle on filmed productions shot on location and in larger sets  Domestic interiors are often furnished with stained wood wall panels and furniture  and items of brown leather furniture  This is to give a sumptuous and luxurious look suggesting the wealth of the characters  Daytime serials often foreground other sumptuous elements of set decoration  presenting a  mid shot of characters viewed through a frame of lavish floral displays  glittering crystal decanters or gleaming antique furniture   8  Few US daytime soap operas routinely feature location or exterior shot footage  Guiding Light began shooting many of its scenes outdoors in its final two seasons   Often an outdoor locale is recreated in the studio  Australian and UK daily soap operas invariably feature a certain amount of exterior shot footage in every episode  This is usually shot in the same location and often on a purpose built set  with new exterior locations for particular events  The visual quality of a soap opera is usually lower than prime time US television drama series due to the lower budgets and quicker production times  This is also because soap operas are recorded on videotape using a multicamera setup  unlike primetime productions which are usually shot on film and frequently using the single camera shooting style  Because of the lower resolution of video images  and also because of the emotional situations portrayed in soap operas  daytime serials make heavy use of closeup shots  Programs in the United States did not make the full conversion to high definition broadcasting until September 2011  when The Bold and the Beautiful became the last soap to convert to the format  Soap operas have idiosyncratic blocking techniques  In one common situation  a romantically involved couple start a conversation face to face  then one character will turn 180  and face away from the other character while conversation continues  This allows both characters to appear together in a single shot  and both facing the audience  This is unrealistic in real life and is not frequently seen in film or on television outside US daytime serials  but it is an accepted soap opera convention sometime referred to as a Two Shot West  14   edit  Decline Soap opera ratings have fallen precipitously in the U S  since the 2000s  No new daytime soap opera has been created since Passions in 1999  while many have been cancelled  The Young and the Restless  the highest rated soap opera  now averages less than 5 million daily viewers  a rating easily exceeded by several non scripted programs such as Judge Judy   15 SOAPnet  which largely airs soap opera reruns  is expected to close in 2012 due to the general decline in the format  16  Since January 2012  four daytime soap operas   General Hospital  Days of our Lives  The Young and the Restless  and The Bold and the Beautiful   continue to air on the three major networks  down from 12 in 1990 91 and a high of 19 in 1969 70  This is the first time since 1953 that there are only four soap operas on broadcast television  17  The years 2009 to 2011 have seen the fall of America s veteran soaps  The longest running program in television and radio history  Guiding Light  barely reached 2 1 millions daily viewers in 2009 and was ended   18 As the World Turns aired its final episode in 2010 after a 54 year run  As the World Turns was the last of 20 soap operas produced by Procter  amp  Gamble  the same company that initiated the  soap opera  expression back in the 1930s  19 All My Children and One Life to Live  each having an over four decade run  were both cancelled in 2011  with All My Children airing its finale on September 2011 and One Life to Live last airing on January 2012  Beginning in the 1970s  as women increasingly worked outside of the home  daytime television viewing declined  Since more people were at work  fewer people are available to watch daytime serials  New generations of potential viewers were not raised watching soaps with their mothers  leaving the long and complex story lines foreign to younger audiences  and audiences who watch the programs in common settings such as restaurants  university common rooms  work breakrooms  and health clubs are not counted as ACNielsen does not track this type of viewing  The three major networks do not count in the ratings the modern alternative ways to watch daytime soap operas such as on the internet  SOAPnet or on DVR  further underrating the performance of these shows  The rise of cable television and the internet have also provided new sources of entertainment during the day  Part of the genre s decline has also been attributed to audiences switching to reality programming as a source of TV melodrama  20  Daytime programming alternatives like talk shows and game shows cost up to 50  less to produce than scripted dramas  21   making those formats more profitable and attractive to networks  even if they receive the same or slightly lower ratings than soaps  As reflected by the cancellations of Sunset Beach and Port Charles  it can sometime be more beneficial for a broadcasting network to return a timeslot to its local stations than to keep on the air a soap opera with disappointing ratings  Compounding the financial pressure on scripted programming was an advertising recession resulting from the financial crisis of 2007 2010  causing shows to reduce their budgets  sometimes resulting in cast reductions  22   edit  The primetime serial Serials produced for primetime slots have also found success  The first real prime time soap opera was Peyton Place  1964 1969  on ABC  It was based in part on the 1957 film also titled Peyton Place  which was based on the 1956 novel   The popularity of Peyton Place prompted the CBS network to spin off popular As the World Turns character Lisa Miller into her own evening soap opera  Our Private World  originally titled  The Woman Lisa  in its planning stages   Our Private World ran from May until September 1965  The character of Lisa returned to As The World Turns after the series ended  The structure of the Peyton Place with its episodic plots and long running story arcs would set the mold for the prime time serials of the 1980s when the format reached its pinnacle  The successful prime time serials of the 1980s included Dallas  Dynasty  Knots Landing  and Falcon Crest  These shows frequently dealt with wealthy families and their personal and big business travails  Common characteristics were sumptuous sets and costumes  complex storylines examining business schemes and intrigue  and spectacular disaster cliffhanger situations  Each of these series featured a wealthy  domineering  promiscuous and passionate antagonist as a key character in the storyline   J  R  Ewing  Alexis Colby  Abby Cunningham and Angela Channing respectively  These villainous schemers became immensely popular figures that audiences  loved to hate   Unlike daytime serials which are shot on video in a studio using the multicamera setup  these evening series were shot on film using a single camera setup  and featured much location shot footage  often in picturesque locales  Dallas  its spin off Knots Landing  and Falcon Crest all initially featured episodes with self contained stories and specific guest stars who appeared in just that episode  Each story would be completely resolved by the end of the episode and there were no end of episode cliffhanger  After the first couple of seasons all three shows changed their story format to that of a pure soap opera with interwoven ongoing narratives that ran over several episodes  Dynasty featured this format throughout its run  The soap opera s distinctive open plot structure and complex continuity was increasingly incorporated into American prime time television programs of the period  The first significant drama series to do this was Hill Street Blues  This series  produced by Steven Bochco  featured many elements borrowed from soap operas such as an ensemble cast  multi episode storylines  and extensive character development over the course of the series  It and the later Cagney  amp  Lacey overlaid the police series formula with ongoing narratives exploring the personal lives and interpersonal relationships of the regular characters  23  The success of these series prompted other drama series  such as St  Elsewhere  and situation comedy series  to incorporate serialized stories and story structure to varying degrees  The prime time soap operas and drama series of the 1990s  such as Beverly Hills  90210  Melrose Place  and Dawson s Creek  focused more on younger characters  In the 2000s  ABC began to revitalize the primetime soap opera format with shows such as Desperate Housewives  Grey s Anatomy  Brothers  amp  Sisters  Lost  Private Practice and most recently Revenge and Ringer  which they co produced with CBS for the CW  While not soaps in the traditional sense  these shows managed to appeal to wide audiences with their high drama mixed with humor  and are soap operas by definition  These successes led to NBC launching serials  including Heroes and Friday Night Lights  The upstart MyNetworkTV  a sister company of Fox  launched a line of prime time telenovelas  a genre that is similar to a soap opera in terms of content  upon its launch in 2006  but ended its use of the format in 2007 after disappointing ratings   edit  United Kingdom See List of longest serving soap opera actors In the United Kingdom  soap operas are one of the most popular genres  most being broadcast during prime time  In comparison to US serials which frequently portray romantic storylines in sumptuous and glamorous locales  most UK soap operas focus on more everyday  working class communities  The most popular soaps are Coronation Street  EastEnders  Emmerdale  Hollyoaks  Doctors  and the Australian produced Neighbours and Home and Away  The first three of these are consistently among the highest rated shows on British television  The 1986 Christmas Day episode of EastEnders is often given as the highest rated UK soap opera episode ever  with 30 15 million viewers  in 2007  the UK had approximately 54 million viewers   The figure of 30 15 million was actually a combination of the original broadcast which had just over 19 million viewers  and the Sunday omnibus edition with 10 million viewers  The combined 30 15 million audience figure often sees it attributed as the highest rated program in UK television for the 1980s  comparable to the records set by the 1970 splashdown of Apollo 13  28 6 million viewers   and Princess Diana s funeral in 1997  32 1 million viewers   24  Coronation Street  EastEnders and Emmerdale are popularly known as the  flagship  soaps  as they are the highest rating programmes for ITV and the BBC respectively  Poor ratings for a UK flagship serial sometimes brings with it questions about the associated channel  The soaps are so popular they are not routinely scheduled against each other  Episodes of serials have clashed only on isolated occasions when extended episodes have been screened   edit  Origins Soap operas in the U K  began on radio and consequently were associated with the BBC  The BBC continues to broadcast the world s longest running radio soap  The Archers  which has been running nationally since 1951  It is currently broadcast on BBC Radio 4 and continues to attract over five million listeners  or roughly 25  of the radio listening population of the UK at that time of the evening  An early television serial was The Grove Family on the BBC  148 episodes were produced from 1954 to 1957  The series was broadcast live and only a handful of recordings were retained in the archives  In the 1960s Coronation Street revolutionised UK television and quickly became a British institution  Another of the 1960s was Emergency Ward 10  on ITV  The BBC also produced several serials  Compact was about the staff of a women s magazine  The Newcomers was about the upheaval caused by a large firm setting up a plant in a small town  United  ran for 147 episodes and focused on a football team  199 Park Lane was an upper class serial that ran for just 18 episodes in 1965  None of these serials came close to making the same impact as Coronation Street  Indeed most of the 1960s BBC serials were largely wiped  During the 1960s Coronation Street s main rival was Crossroads  a daily serial that began in 1964 and was broadcast by ITV in the early evening  Crossroads was set in a Birmingham motel and  although the series was popular  its purported low technical standard and bad acting were much mocked  By the 1980s its ratings had begun to decline  Several attempts to revamp the series through cast changes and  later  expanding the focus from the motel to the surrounding community were unsuccessful  Crossroads was cancelled in 1988   A new version of Crossroads was later produced  running from 2001 until 2003   A later rival to Coronation Street was ITV s Emmerdale Farm  later renamed Emmerdale  which began in 1972 in a daytime slot and had a rural Yorkshire setting  Increased viewing figures saw Emmerdale being moved to a prime time slot in the 1980s  Pobol y Cwm  People of the Valley  is a Welsh language serial produced by the BBC since October 1974  It is the longest running television soap opera produced by the BBC  Pobol y Cwm was originally transmitted on BBC Wales television between 1974 and 1982  It then transferred to the Welsh language television station S4C when it opened in the November 1982  The series was occasionally shown on BBC1 in London during periods of regional optout in the mid late 1970s  Pobol y Cwm was briefly shown in the rest of the UK in 1994 on BBC2  with English subtitles  It is consistently the most watched programme of the week on S4C  25   edit  The 1980s Daytime soap operas were non existent until the 1970s because there was virtually no daytime television in the UK  ITV introduced General Hospital  which later transferred to a prime time slot  and Scottish Television had Take the High Road  which lasted for over twenty years  Later  daytime slots were filled with an influx of older Australian soap operas such as The Young Doctors  The Sullivans  Sons and Daughters  A Country Practice  Richmond Hill and eventually  Neighbours and Home and Away  These achieved significant levels of popularity  Neighbours and Home and Away were moved to early evening slots and the UK soap opera boom began in the late 1980s  When Channel 4 began in 1982 it launched its own soap  the Liverpool based Brookside  on its first day  Over the next decade Brookside re defined soap  The focus of Brookside was different to previous soaps  The setting was a middle class new build cul de sac  unlike Coronation Street and Emmerdale Farm which were set in established working class communities  The characters in Brookside were generally either people who had advanced themselves from inner city council estates  or the upper middle class who had fallen on hard times  Though Brookside was still broadcast in a pre watershed slot  8pm and 8 30pm on weekdays  around 5pm for the omnibus on Saturdays   it was more liberal than other soaps of the time  the dialogue regularly included expletives  This stemmed from the overall more liberal policy of the channel in that period  The soap was also heavily politicised  Bobby Grant  Ricky Tomlinson   a militant trade unionist anti hero  was the most overtly political character  Storylines were often more sensationalist than on other soaps  in the soaps history there were two armed sieges on the street  and were staged more graphically with violence  particularly  rape  being often used  In 1985  the BBC s London based soap opera EastEnders debuted and was a near instant success with viewers and critics alike  with the first episode attracting over 17 million viewers  The Christmas Day 1986 episode was watched by 30 15 million viewers and contained a scene of divorce papers served to Angie Watts by her husband Den  Critics talked about the downfall of Coronation Street citation needed   but Coronation Street continued successfully  In 1994 when the two serials were scheduled opposite each other  and Corrie won the slot  For the better part of ten years when    the show has shared the number one position with Coronation Street  with varying degrees of difference between the two  A scene from EastEnders on Christmas Day 1986  watched by 30 15 million viewers  The story  where Den Watts served his wife Angie with divorce papers  was the highest rated soap episode in British history  and the highest rated programme in the UK during the 1980s In the late 1980s Central TV acquired the Australian soap opera Prisoner  which was produced between 1979 and 1986  It was eventually screened around the country in differing slots usually around 11pm  under the title Prisoner  Cell Block H  Its airing in the UK was staggered  so different regions of the country saw it at a different pace  The series was immensely successful which led to it being repeated after the series had reached its conclusion in the Midlands  Rival network Five also acquired repeat rights for a full rerun of the series  starting in 1997  In 2011  the television network 111 Hits in Australia began a full rerun of the series to its pay tv subscribers   edit  The 1990s In 1992 the BBC launched Eldorado to alternate with EastEnders  The series was heavily criticised and only lasted a year  Nevertheless soap operas gained increasing prominence in UK schedules  In 1995 Channel 4 introduced Hollyoaks  a soap with a youth focus  When Five began in March 1997 it came with its own soap opera  Family Affairs  which debuted as a five days a week soap  Brookside s premise evolved in the 1990s  It phased out the politicised stories of the 1980s  shifting the emphasis to controversial and sensationalist stories such as child rape  sibling incest  religious cults  and drug addiction  Coronation Street and Brookside started to release straight to video features  The Coronation Street releases generally kept the pace and style of conventional series episodes with the action set in foreign locations  The Brookside releases were set in the usual series location but featured stories with adult content not allowed on pre watershed television  with these releases given  18  certificates  The remodelling of the Emmerdale Farm series  led to the Farm being dropped from the title in 1989  In 1993  many of the changes where executed via a plane crash that partially destroyed the village and killed several characters  This attracted criticism as it was broadcast near the fifth anniversary of the Lockerbie bombing  The storyline drew the soap its highest ever viewing figures of 18 million  and helped massively with the revamp of the series which became a success and Emmerdale grew in popularity  Throughout the 1990s the soap operas Brookside  Coronation Street  Eastenders and Emmerdale continued to flourish  Each increased the number of weekly episodes transmitted by at least one  further defining soap opera as the leading genre in British television  Hollyoaks was introduced in 1995  a soap with a youth focus   edit  The 2000s Since 2000 new soap operas have continued to be developed  Daytime drama Doctors began in March 2000  preceding Neighbours on BBC1  In 2002  as the ratings continued to fall for Scottish serial High Road  formerly Take The High Road   BBC Scotland launched River City  which proved popular and effectively replaced High Road when it was cancelled in 2003  The long running serial Brookside ended in November 2003 after 21 years on air  leaving Hollyoaks as Channel 4 s flagship serial  A new version of Crossroads featuring a mostly new cast was produced by Carlton Television for ITV in 2001  It did not achieve satisfactory ratings and was cancelled in 2003  In 2001 ITV also launched a new early evening serial entitled Night and Day  This series too attracted low viewing figures and after being shifted to a late night time slot was cancelled in 2003  Family Affairs  which was broadcast opposite the racier Hollyoaks  never achieved significantly high viewing figures leading to several dramatic revamps of the cast and marked changes in style and even location over its run  By 2004 Family Affairs had a larger fan base and won its first awards  but was cancelled in late 2005  ITV launched the new soap opera The Royal Today in 2008  The Royal Today was a daily spin off of popular sixties drama The Royal  which had been running in a primetime slot since 2002  Just days later soap opera parody series Echo Beach premiered alongside its sister series  the comedy Moving Wallpaper  Both Echo Beach and The Royal Today ended after their initial first season  Due to poor viewing figures neither were picked up for a second run  Radio soap opera Silver Street debuted on the BBC Asian Network in 2004  Poor ratings and criticism of the series led to its cancellation in 2010  26   edit  Format UK soap operas for many years usually only aired two nights a week  The exception was the original Crossroads which began as a five days a week soap opera in the 1960s  but was later reduced  Things started to change in 1989 when Coronation Street began airing three times a week  In 1996 it expanded again  to air four episodes a week  Brookside began in 1982 with two episodes a week  Starting 1990 it aired three episodes a week  The trend was followed by EastEnders in 1994 and Emmerdale in 1997  Family Affairs debuted as a five days a week soap in 1997 and regularly ran five episodes a week its entire run  The imported Neighbours screens as five new episodes a week  which are shown once at 1 45 pm and repeated at 5 30 pm on Five each weekday  Currently Coronation Street  which began screening two episodes on Monday nights in 2002  and Hollyoaks both produce five episodes a week  while EastEnders screens four  In 2002 Brookside went from three half hour episodes on different week nights to airing one ninety minute episode each week  In 2004 Emmerdale began screening six episodes a week  Doctors screens five episodes a week  It is the only soap without a weekend omnibus repeat screening  In a January 2008 overhaul of the ITV network the Sunday episodes of Coronation Street and Emmerdale were moved out of their slots  Coronation Street added a second episode on Friday evenings at 8 30 pm  Emmerdale s Tuesday edition was extended to an hour  putting it in direct competition with rival EastEnders  In July 2009 the schedules of these serials were changed again  Starting 23 July 2009 Coronation Street moved from the Wednesday slot it held for 49 years  to Thursday evenings  Emmerdale s reverted to screening just one thirty minute episode on Tuesday evenings and the other thirty minute installment was moved to Thursday evenings  27  UK soap operas are shot on videotape in the studio using a multicamera setup  Since the 1980s they routinely feature outdoors footage in each episode  This footage is shot on videotape on a purpose built outdoor set that represents the community the soap focuses on   edit  Australia See List of longest serving soap opera actors Australia has had quite a number of well known soap operas  some of which have gained cult followings in the UK  New Zealand and other countries  The majority of Australian television soap operas are produced for early evening or evening timeslots  They usually produce two or two and a half hours of new material each week  either arranged as four or five half hour episodes a week  or two one hour episodes  Stylistically they most closely resemble UK soap operas in that they are nearly always shot on videotape  mainly in the studio using a multicamera setup  The original Australian serials were shot entirely in the studio  During the 1970s  occasional filmed inserts were used to incorporate outdoor shot sequences in soap operas  Outdoor shooting later became commonplace and starting in the late 1970s it became standard practice that there will be some location shot footage in each episode of any Australian soap opera  often to capitalise on the attractiveness and exotic nature of these locations for international audiences  28  Most Australian soap operas focus on a mixed age range of middle class characters and will regularly feature a range of locations where the various  disparate  characters can meet and interact  such as the caf   the surf club  the wine bar  or the school  28   edit  Early serials The genre began in Australia  as in other countries  on radio  One such radio serial  Big Sister  featured actress Thelma Scott in the cast and aired nationally for five years from 1942  Probably the best known Australian radio serial was Blue Hills which ran from 1949 to 1976  With the advent of Australian television in 1956 daytime television serials followed  The first Australian television soap opera was Autumn Affair  1958   Each episode of this serial was fifteen minutes and it screened each weekday on the Seven Network  The series failed to secure a sponsor and ended in 1959 after a run of 156 episodes  This was followed by The Story of Peter Grey  1961   Again this was a Seven Network series screened weekdays in a daytime slot  with each episode fifteen minutes in duration  The Story of Peter Grey had a run of 164 episodes  The first successful wave of Australian evening soap operas started in 1967 with Bellbird produced by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation  This rural based serial screened in an early evening slot in fifteen minute installments and was a moderate success but built up a consistent and loyal viewer base  especially in rural areas  and enjoyed a ten year run  Motel  1968  was Australia s first half hour soap opera  Screened in a daytime slot the series had a short run of 132 episodes   edit  1970s hit soaps The first big soap opera hit in Australia was the sex melodrama Number 96 which began in March 1972  screening on Network Ten in a nighttime slot  Number 96 brought such rarely explored topics as homosexuality  adultery  drug use  rape within marriage and racism into Australian living rooms en masse  The series became famous for its sex scenes and nudity and for its comedy characters  many of whom became cult heroes in Australia  By 1973 Number 96 had become Australia s highest rating show  In 1974 the sexed up antics of Number 96 prompted the creation of The Box  which rivaled it in terms of nudity and sexual situations and screened in a nighttime slot  Produced by Crawford Productions  many critics considered The Box to be a more slickly produced and better written show than Number 96  and in its first year it was extremely popular  Meanwhile in 1974 the Reg Grundy Organisation created its first soap opera  and significantly Australia s first teen soap opera  Class of  74  Its attempts to hint at the sex and sin shown more openly on Number 96 and The Box along with its high school setting and early evening time slot meant it came under intense scrutiny of the Broadcasting Control Board who vetted scripts and altered whole storylines  By 1975 both Number 96 and The Box  perhaps as a reaction to declining ratings for both shows  de emphasised the sex and nudity moving more in the direction of comedy  Class of  74 was renamed Class of  75 and also added more slapstick comedy for its second year  but the revamped show s ratings dwindled and it was cancelled in mid 1975  A feature film version of Bellbird entitled Country Town was produced in 1971 not by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation but by two of the show s stars  Gary Gray and Terry McDermott  Number 96 and The Box also had feature film versions  both of which had the same title as the series  released in 1974 and 1975 respectively  As Australian television was in black and white until 1975 these theatrical releases all had the novelty of being in colour  The film versions of Number 96 and The Box also allowed more explicit nudity than could be shown on television at that time  Launched on the Nine Network in late 1976 was The Sullivans  a series chronicling the effects of World War II on a Melbourne family  Produced by Crawford s this show was a ratings success and attracted many positive reviews  At around the same time Grundy s created a new teen oriented soap  The Young Doctors  which also screened on Channel Nine starting late 1976  This show eschewed the sex and sin of Number 96 and The Box instead emphasising light weight storylines and romance  It was also popular but unlike The Sullivans it was not a success with critics  Meanwhile in 1977 Number 96 would re introduce nudity  with several much publicised full frontal nude scenes featured in an attempt to boost the show s plummeting ratings   edit  Rise of the Grundy Organisation serials Bellbird  Number 96 and The Box were all cancelled in 1977  All had been experiencing declining ratings since 1975 and various attempts to revamp the shows with cast reshuffles or spectacular disaster storylines had proved only temporarily successful  Late that year they were replaced by such successful new shows as the Crawfords Produced Cop Shop  1977 1984  on Channel Seven  which was a meld of soap opera and police drama  and The Restless Years  1977 1981  on Channel Ten  which was another teen soap produced by the Reg Grundy Organisation  The Reg Grundy Organisation subsequently reached even higher levels of success with women s prison drama Prisoner  1979 1986  on Network Ten  and melodramatic family saga Sons and Daughters  1981 1987  on the Seven Network  Both shows achieved high ratings in their first run  and unusually  found success in repeats after their original runs ended  The Young Doctors and The Sullivans ran on Nine until 1982  Thereafter Channel Nine attempted many new soap operas  several produced by the Reg Grundy Organisation  including Taurus Rising  Waterloo Station  Starting Out and Possession  along with Prime Time produced by Crawford s  None of these programs were successful and most were cancelled after only a few months  The Reg Grundy Organisation also created Neighbours  a suburban based daily serial devised as a sedate family drama with some comedy and lightweight situations  for the Seven Network in 1985  Produced in Melbourne at the studios of HSV 7  Neighbours rated well in Melbourne  Brisbane and Adelaide  but not in Sydney  Sydney was the only city where it was shown in the earlier 5 30 p m  timeslot which put it up against hit dating game show Perfect Match on Channel 10 so Neighbours had low ratings in Sydney  and Seven s Sydney station ATN 7 quickly lost interest in the show  HSV 7 in Melbourne lobbied heavily to keep Neighbours going but ATN 7 managed to convince the rest of the network to cancel the show and instead keep ATN 7 s own Sydney based dramas A Country Practice and Sons and Daughters  After the network cancelled Neighbours it was immediately picked up by Channel Ten  They revamped the cast and scripts slightly and from January 20  1986 aired the series in the 7 00 p m  slot  It initially attracted low viewing figures however after a concerted publicity drive Ten managed to transform the series into a major success  turning several of its actors into major international stars  The show s popularity eventually declined and it was moved to the 6 30 p m  slot in 1992  yet the series retains consistent viewing figures in Australia and is still running today  making it Australia s longest running soap opera  The success of Neighbours prompted the creation of somewhat similar suburban and family or teen oriented soap operas such as Home and Away  1988   on Channel Seven and Richmond Hill  1988  on Channel Ten  Both proved popular  however Richmond Hill emerged as only a moderate success and was cancelled after one year to be replaced on Ten by E Street  1989 1993   Meanwhile Nine had still failed to find a successful new soap opera  After the failure of family drama Family and Friends in 1990 they launched the raunchier and more extreme Chances in 1991  Chances resurrected the sex and melodrama of Number 96 and The Box in an attempt to attract attention  Chances achieved only moderate ratings  although the increasingly bizarre storylines were much discussed  The series continued into 1992  albeit in a late night timeslot  and was cancelled in 1992   edit  Australian soaps internationally Several Australian soap operas have also found significant international success  In the UK starting in the mid 1980s daytime screenings of The Young Doctors  The Sullivans  Sons and Daughters and Neighbours achieved significant success  Neighbours was subsequently moved to an early evening slot  Grundy s Prisoner began screening in the United States in 1979 and achieved high ratings in many regions there  however only the first three years of the series would be screened in that country  Prisoner was also screened in late night timeslots in the UK beginning in the late 1980s  achieving enduring cult success there  The show became so popular in the UK that it prompted the creation of two stage plays and a stage musical based on the show  all of which toured the UK  among many other spin offs  In the late 1990s Five repeated Prisoner in the UK  Between 1998 and 2005 Five ran late night repeats of Sons and Daughters  During the 1980s the Australian attempts to emulate big budget US soap operas such as Dallas and Dynasty had resulted in Taurus Rising and Return to Eden  two slick soap opera dramas with big budgets and shot entirely on film  Though their middling Australian ratings ensured they ran only a single season both programs were successfully sold internationally  Other shows to achieve varying levels of international success include Richmond Hill  E Street  Paradise Beach  1993 1994   and Pacific Drive  1995 1997   Indeed these last two series were designed specifically for international sales  Channel Seven s Home and Away  a teen soap developed as a rival to Neighbours  has also achieved significant and enduring success on UK television   edit  Teen oriented serials to the world Since 1990 most new Australian serials have been based on the successful Neighbours formula of foregrounding youthful attractive casts in appealing locations  The main exception to this was the Australian Broadcasting Corporation produced Something in the Air  a rural based serial examining a range of characters in a small country town  This series ran from 2000 until 2002  Attempts to replicate the success of daily teen oriented serials Neighbours and Home and Away saw the creation of Echo Point  1995  and Breakers  1999  on Network Ten  None of these programs emerged as long running successes and Neighbours and Home and Away remained the most visible and consistently successful Australian soap operas in production  In their home country they both attract respectable although not spectacular ratings  By 2004 Neighbours was regularly attracting just under a million viewers per episode 29    low for Australian prime time television  By March 2007 Australian viewing figures for Neighbours had fallen to fewer than 700 000 a night  prompting a revamp of cast and graphics used on the show  and a deemphasis on the action oriented direction the series had moved in with a move to refocus the show on the family storylines it is traditionally known for  30  However  Neighbours and Home and Away both continue to achieve significant ratings in the UK  This and other lucrative overseas markets  along with Australian broadcasting laws that enforce a minimum amount of local drama production for commercial television networks  help ensure that both programs remain in production  Both shows get higher total ratings in the UK than in Australia  the UK has three times Australia s population  and the UK networks make a major contribution to the production costs  It has been suggested that with their emphasis on the younger  attractive and charismatic characters  Neighbours and Home and Away have found success in the middle ground between glamorous  fantastic US soaps with their wealthy but tragic heroes 8  and the more grim  naturalistic UK soap operas populated by older  unglamorous characters  28  The casts of Neighbours and Home and Away are predominantly younger and more attractive than the casts of UK soaps  and without excessive wealth and glamour of the US daytime serial  8  a middleground in which they have found their lucrative niche  Neighbours  which is celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2005  was aired on the US channel Oxygen in March 2004  however it attracted few viewers  perhaps in part because it was scheduled opposite well established and highly popular US soap operas such as All My Children and The Young and The Restless  and due to low ratings it was cancelled shortly afterwards  New Australian serial headLand premiered on Channel Seven in November 2005  This new series rose from the ashes of a proposed Home and Away spinoff that was to have been produced in conjunction with the UK s Channel Five  which screens Home and Away  The spin off idea was cancelled after Channel Five pulled out of the deal  which meant that the show could potentially screen on a rival UK channel  so Five requested that the new show developed as a stand alone series and not feed off a series they own a stake in  The series premiered in Australia on November 15  2005 but was not a ratings success and was cancelled January 23  2006  The series broadcast on E4 and Channel 4 in the UK  After losing the rights to screen Neighbours in the United Kingdom to channel five  the BBC commissioned new serial Out of the Blue as its replacement  Out of the Blue was produced in Australia  It began screening on BBC One on weekday afternoons on April 28  2008 31  but after lower than desired ratings figures it was shifted to BBC Two from May 19  2008  32  33  Production on the series was not renewed beyond its first season  34   edit  Canada Due to the economics of television production in Canada  relatively few daily soap operas have been produced on English Canadian television  with most Canadian stations that do air soap operas airing American or British ones  Notable daily soaps that did exist included Family Passions  Scarlett Hill  Strange Paradise  Metropia  Train 48 and the international coproduction Foreign Affairs  Family Passions was an hour long  as is typical of American daytime soaps  all of the others were half hour programs  Short run soaps  including 49th  amp  Main and North South  have also aired  Many of these were produced in an effort to comply with Canadian content regulations  which require a majority of programming on Canadian television to originate from Canada  Notable prime time soap operas in Canada have included Riverdale  House of Pride  Paradise Falls  He Shoots  He Scores  Loving Friends and Perfect Couples  North of 60  and The City  The Degrassi franchise of youth dramas also incorporated some elements of soap opera  On French language television in Quebec the t l roman has been a popular mainstay of network programming since the 1950s  Notable t l romans have included Rue des Pignons  Les Belles Histoires des pays d en haut  Diva  La famille Plouffe  and the soap opera parody Le C ur a ses raisons   edit  India Main article  Indian soap opera India has many soap operas  These started in the late 1980s  as more and more people began to buy televisions  At the beginning of the twenty first century  soap operas became an integral part of Indian culture  Indian soap operas mostly concentrate on the conflict between love and arranged marriages occurring in India citation needed   Many of the soap operas include conflicts between mothers in law and daughters in law  The most common languages in which Indian serials are made include Hindi  Punjabi  Marathi  Gujarati  Bengali  Tamil  Kannada  Telugu  and Malayalam  Many soap operas produced in India are also broadcast overseas in the UK  USA  and some parts of Europe  South Africa  and Australia  They are often mass produced under large production banners  with companies like Balaji Telefilms running different language versions of the same serial on different television networks or channels   edit  Europe  edit  Remakes of Australian serials Australian serial The Restless Years was remade in the Netherlands as Goede tijden  slechte tijden  first broadcast 1990  and in Germany as Gute Zeiten  schlechte Zeiten  since 1992   both titles translate to  good times  bad times   These remakes are still running although they have long since diverged from the original Australian storylines  They are the highest rated soap operas in their respective countries  A later Australian serial  Sons and Daughters  has inspired five remakes produced under license from the original producers and based  initially  on original story and character outlines  These are Verbotene Liebe

1996 2001   US daytime serials As The World Turns and The Bold and the Beautiful have been broadcast in the Netherlands  As the World Turns has been aired since 1990  with Dutch subtitles   edit  Germany In the 80s  German networks successfully added American daytime and primetime soap operas to their schedule before Das Erste introduced its first self produced weekly soap with Lindenstra e  which was seen as a German counterpart to Coronation Street  Like in other countries  the soap opera met with negative reviews but eventually proved critics wrong with nearly 13 million viewers turning in each week  Even though the format proved successful it took until 1992 before Gute Zeiten  schlechte Zeiten became the first German daily soap opera  Early ratings were bad as were the reviews  but as the network RTL was willing to give its first soap opera a chance  ratings got better and claimed to seven million viewers in 2002  Not long after Gute Zeiten  schlechte Zeiten  Das Erste introduced Marienhof  airing it two times a week  After successfully creating the first German daily soap  production company Grundy Ufa wanted to produce another soap for RTL  Like GZSZ  the format was based on an Australian soap opera from Reg Watson  But RTL didn t like the series  outline about separated twins meeting each other for the first time after twenty years and falling in love not knowing that they are related  The project was then presented to Das Erste and Verbotene Liebe premiered on January 2  1995  With the premiere of Verbotene Liebe  the network turned Marienhof into a daily soap as well  In the meanwhile  RTL started Unter uns in late 1994 also produced by Grundy Ufa  The ZDF started a business adventure with Canada and co produced the short lived series Family Passions  starring stars like Gordon Thomson  Roscoe Born  Dietmar Sch nherr and a young Hayden Christiansen  It started on December 5  1994 and lasted 130 episodes as a daytime serial  After it was canceled  the network introduced Jede Menge Leben to its audience  After a giant crossover with Freunde f rs Leben  Forsthaus Falkenau and Unser Lehrer Doktor Specht  the soap opera got canceled after 313 episodes  Sat 1 tried to get in the soap business as well  after successfully showing the Australian soap opera Neighbours  which got canceled in 1995 to the talk show phenomenon which took over most of Germany s daytime  The network first tried to tell a family saga with So ist das Leben   die Wagenfelds  before failing with Geliebte Schwestern  RTL II made its own short attempt with Alle zusammen   jeder f r sich  In 1999  after the lasting success of Gute Zeiten  schlechte Zeiten  Marienhof  Unter uns and Verbotene Liebe  ProSieben aired Mallorca   Suche nach dem Paradies  set on the Spanish island with the same name  After nine months the network gave up  thanks to high production costs and a too little audience  Even though ratings were getting better the show ended its run in the morning hours  The soap opera became something like cult  as its 200 episodes were repeated several times in Free TV and Pay TV  Alles was z hlt became the last successfully introduced daily soap in 2006  airing as a lead in to Gute Zeiten  schlechte Zeiten and also being produced by Grundy Ufa  Since Germany started to produce its own telenovelas  all soap operas had to face a decline in the ratings  Unter uns was in a scare of cancellation in 2009  which was prevented by budget cuts and the firing of original cast member Holger Franke  Fans were outraged by his firing and the character s death  which resulted in a ratings spike in early 2010  After Unter uns was saved  Das Erste was about to make a decision in its soap line up  Marienhof had to deal with multiple issues in story telling as well as in producing a successful half hour of television  Several changes were made within months  but in the end Marienhof was canceled in June 2011  Verbotene Liebe was about to get canceled as well  but could convince the network with its changes in 2010 as well as in 2011  The soap opera later was extended to an hour after Marienhof was canceled and the network tried to make up their mind about a new line up  While Gute Zeiten  schlechte Zeiten  Unter uns  Verbotene Liebe and Alles was z hlt are currently the only daily soaps on the air  the telenovelas Sturm der Liebe and Rote Rosen are considered soaps by the press as well  thanks to the changing protagonists every season   edit  Belgium In Belgium the two major soap operas are Thuis  Home  and Familie  Family   Soap operas have been very popular in Flanders  the Dutch speaking part of Belgium   Familie  started in late 1991  and with over 5000 half hour episodes  it has the highest amount of episode of a soap on

several dramas but had not come close to a long running serial  RT  s first Television soap was Tolka Row was based in urban Dublin  For a number of years both Tolka Row and The Riordans were produced by RT   soon however the urban soap was dropped for the more popular rural soap opera The Riordans   which began in 1965  35  Executives from Yorkshire Television visited the on location filming of The Riordans in the early 1970s and in 1972 began broadcasting Emmerdale Farm based on the successful format of the Irish soap opera  In the late 1970s The Riordans was dropped with great controversy
