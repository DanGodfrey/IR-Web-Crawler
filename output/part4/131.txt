the Greeks call the country Hellas or Ellada  Greek                 and its official name is Hellenic Republic  in English the country is called Greece  which comes from Latin Graecia as used by the Romans and literally means  the land of the Greeks   and derives from the Greek name          however  the name Hellas is sometimes used in English too  History Main article  History of Greece Ancient history Main article  Ancient Greece A map showing the Greek territories and colonies during the Archaic period  While the area around Attica was inhabited during the Upper Paleolithic period  30000 10000 BC   archaeological evidence suggests that the small caves around the Acropolis rock and the Klepsythra spring were in use during the Neolithic period  3000 2800 BC   Greece was the first area in Europe where advanced early civilizations emerged  beginning with the Cycladic civilization on the islands of the Aegean Sea at around 3000 BC  the Minoan civilization in Crete  2700 1500 BC  and then the Mycenaean civilization on the mainland  1900 1100 BC   The period between 1200 and 800 BC is known as the Greek Dark Ages following the supposed Dorian invasion  which marked the end of the Mycenean era  Two of the most celebrated works of Greek literature  the Illiad and the Odyssey by Homer  were written during that period  The Parthenon on the Acropolis of Athens is a symbol of classical Greece  Detail of the Alexander Mosaic  depicting Alexander the Great on his horse Bucephalus  With the end of the dark age of Greece came the emergance of various kingdoms and city states across the Greek peninsula  which spread to the shores of the Black Sea  South Italy  known in Latin as Magna Graecia  or Greater Greece  and Asia Minor  reaching great levels of prosperity that resulted in an unprecedented cultural boom  that of classical Greece  expressed in architecture  drama  science and philosophy  and nurtured in Athens under a democratic environment  However  the fact that Greece was not a unified country meant that conflict between the Greek states was common  The most devastating of intra Greek wars in classical antiquity was the Peloponnesian War  which marked the demise of the Athenian Empire as the leading power in ancient Greece  By 500 BC  the Persian Empire controlled territories ranging from what is now northern Greece and Turkey all the way to Iraq  and posed a threat to the Greek states  Failed attempts by the Greek city states of Asia Minor to overthrow Persian rule failed  and Persia invaded the states of mainland Greece in 492 BC  but was forced to withdraw after a defeat at the Battle of Marathon  A second invasion followed in 480 BC  Despite a heroic resistance at Thermopylae by Spartans and other Greeks  Persian forces sacked Athens  Following successive Greek victories in 480 and 479 BC at Salamis  Plataea and Mycale  the Persians were forced to withdraw for a second time  The military conflicts  known as the Greco Persian Wars  were led mostly by Athens and Sparta  Both were later overshadowed by Thebes and eventually Macedon  with the latter uniting the Greek world in the League of Corinth  also known as the Hellenic League or Greek League  under the guidance of Phillip II  who was elected leader of the first unified Greek state in the history of Greece  Following the assassination of Phillip II  Alexander III   The Great   assumed the leadership of the League of Corinth and launched an invasion of the Persian Empire with the combined forces of all Greek states in 334 BC  Following Greek victories in the battles of Granicus  Issus and Gaugamela  the Greeks marched on Susa and Persepolis  the ceremonial capital of Persia  in 330 BC  The Empire created by Alexander the Great stretched from Greece in the west and Pakistan in the east  and Egypt in the south  Before his sudden death in 323 BC  Alexander was also planning an invasion of Arabia  His death marked the collapse of the vast empire  which was split into several kingsdoms  the most famous of which is Ptolemaic Egypt  Other states founded by Greeks include the Greco Bactrian Kingdom and the Greco Indian Kingdom in India  Greek missionaries would play an important role in propagating Greco Buddhism to China  26  Further east  the Greeks of Alexandria Eschate became known to the Chinese people as the Dayuan  27  The Hellenistic period came to a partial close two centuries later with the establishment of Roman rule over Greek lands in 146 BC  28  Many Greeks migrated to Alexandria  Antioch  Seleucia and the many other new Hellenistic cities in Asia and Africa founded in Alexander s wake  29  The Byzantine Empire Main articles  Byzantine Empire and Byzantine Greece The Byzantine Empire existed for more than a thousand years  from the 4th century to 1453  During most of its existence  it remained one of the most powerful economic  cultural  and military forces in Europe  despite setbacks and territorial losses  especially during the Roman Persian and Byzantine Arab Wars  The Empire recovered during the Macedonian dynasty  rising again to become a preeminent power in the Eastern Mediterranean by the late 10th century  rivalling the Fatimid Caliphate  The Greek peninsula was part of the Byzantine Empire for most of the latter s timespan  After 1071  however  much of Asia Minor  the Empire s heartland  was lost to the Seljuk Turks  The Komnenian restoration regained some ground and briefly reestablished dominance in the 12th century  but following the death of Andronikos I Komnenos and the end of the Komnenos dynasty in the late 12th century the Empire declined again  The Empire received a mortal blow in 1204 from the Fourth Crusade  when it was dissolved and divided into competing Byzantine Greek and Latin realms  Despite the eventual recovery of Constantinople and re establishment of the Empire in 1261  under the Palaiologan emperors  Byzantium remained only one of many rival states in the area for the final 200 years of its existence  However  this period was the most culturally productive time in the Empire  Successive civil wars in the 14th century further sapped the Empire s strength  and most of its remaining territories were lost in the Byzantine Ottoman Wars  which culminated in the Fall of Constantinople and the conquest of remaining territories by the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century  On the eve of the Ottoman conquest much of the Greek intelligentsia migrated to Italy and other parts of Europe not under Ottoman rule  playing a significant role in the Renaissance through the transmission of ancient Greek works to Western Europe  30  Nevertheless  the Ottoman millet system contributed to the cohesion of the Orthodox Greeks by segregating the various peoples within the empire based on religion  as the latter played an integral role in the formation of modern Greek identity  Greeks under the Ottoman Empire Main article  Ottoman Greece The White Tower of Thessaloniki  one of the best known Ottoman structures remaining in Greece  The Ottoman Empire started to move on what are now Greek territories near the end of the 14th century  By the time of the Fall of Constantinople in 1453  much of the Byzantine Empire  including its second largest city  and currently second largest city of Greece  Thessaloniki  had already fallen to the Ottomans  By the 1500s most of Greece was under Ottoman control  while Cyprus and Crete fell in 1571 and 1670  The only part of Greece that managed to escape long term Ottoman rule were the Ionian Islands  which remained under the sovereignty of the Republic of Venice until their capture by the First French Republic in 1797  then the United Kingdom in 1809 and finally their union with Greece in 1864  While Greeks in Constantinople and the Ionian Islands lived in prosperity  much of the population of mainland Greece suffered the economic consequences of the Ottoman conquest  Heavy taxes were enforced  and in later years the Ottoman Empire enacted a policy of creation of hereditary estates  effectively turning the rural Greek populations into a serfdom  The Greek Orthodox Church and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople were considered by the Ottoman governments as the ruling authorities of the entire Christian population of the Ottoman Empire  Greek or not  Although the Ottoman state did not force non Muslims to convert to Islam  many did so superficially as they received tax benefits from the authorities  The Ottoman administration of Greece varied  Some cities had governors appointed by the Sultan  while others  like Athens   were self governed municipalities  Some regions of Greece  like Crete and Epirus  remained effectively autonomous from the central Ottoman state for many centuries  When military conflicts broke out between the Ottoman Empire and other states  Greeks usually took arms against the Empire  with few exceptions  Prior to the Greek revolution  there had been a number of wars which saw Greeks fight against the Ottomans  such as the Greek participation in the Battle of Lepanto in 1571  the Epirus peasants  revolts of 1600 1601  the Morean War of 1684 1699 and the Russian instigated Orlov Revolt in 1770 which aimed at breaking up the Ottoman Empire in favor of Russian interests  The last century of Ottoman rule in Greece saw the birth of some of the most influential figures in Greece s struggle for independence as well as the modern Greek Enlightenment  Rigas Feraios  the first revolutionary to envision an independent Greek state  published a series of documents relating to Greek independence  including but not limited to a national anthem and the first detailed map of Greece  in Vienna  He was later assassinated by the Ottoman authorities in 1798  Other influential figures include Adamantios Korais and Anthimos Gazis  The Greek War of Independence Main article  Greek War of Independence See also  First Hellenic Republic and Greek Declaration of Independence The sortie of Messolonghi  during the Greek War of Independence  1821 1830   by Theodoros Vryzakis  In 1814  a secret organization called the Filiki Eteria was founded with the aim of liberating Greece  The Filiki Eteria planned to launch revolution in the Peloponnese  the Danubian Principalities and Constantinople  The first of these revolts began on 6 March 1821 in the Danubian Principalities under the leadership of Alexandros Ypsilantis  but it was soon put down by the Ottomans  The events in the north urged the Greeks in the Peloponnese in action and on 17 March 1821 the Maniots declared war on the Ottomans  By the end of the month  the Peloponnese was in open revolt against the Ottomans and by October 1821 the Greeks under Theodoros Kolokotronis had captured Tripolitsa  The Peloponnesian revolt was quickly followed by revolts in Crete  Macedonia and Central Greece  which would soon be suppressed  Meanwhile  the makeshift Greek navy was achieving success against the Ottoman navy in the Aegean Sea and prevented Ottoman reinforcements from arriving by sea  The Turks and Egyptians ravaged several Greek islands  including Chios and Psara  31  Tensions soon developed among different Greek factions  leading to two consecutive civil wars  Meanwhile  the Ottoman Sultan negotiated with Mehmet Ali of Egypt  who agreed to send his son Ibrahim Pasha to Greece with an army to suppress the revolt in return for territorial gain  Ibrahim landed in the Peloponnese in February 1825 and had immediate success  by the end of 1825  most of the Peloponnese was under Egyptian control  and the city of Missolonghi put under siege by the Turks since April 1825 fell in April 1826  Although Ibrahim was defeated in Mani  he had succeeded in suppressing most of the revolt in the Peloponnese and Athens had been retaken  Following years of negotiation  three Great Powers  Russia  the United Kingdom and France  decided to intervene in the conflict and each nation sent a navy to Greece  Following news that combined Ottoman Egyptian fleets were going to attack the Greek island of Hydra  the allied fleet intercepted the Ottoman Egyptian fleet at Navarino  Following a week long standoff  a battle began which resulted in the destruction of the Ottoman Egyptian fleet  With the help of a French expeditionary force  the Greeks drove the Turks out of the Peloponnese and proceeded to the captured part of Central Greece by 1828  As a result of years of negotiation  the nascent Greek state was finally recognized under the London Protocol in 1830  Greece in the 19th century See also  Kingdom of Greece Territorial evolution of Kingdom of Greece until 1947  In 1827 Ioannis Kapodistrias  from Corfu  was chosen as the first governor of the new Republic  However  following his assassination in 1831  the Great Powers installed a monarchy under Otto  of the Bavarian House of Wittelsbach  In 1843 an uprising forced the king to grant a constitution and a representative assembly  Due to his unimpaired authoritarian rule he was eventually dethroned in 1862 and a year later replaced by Prince Wilhelm  William  of Denmark  who took the name George I and brought with him the Ionian Islands as a coronation gift from Britain  In 1877 Charilaos Trikoupis  who is credited with significant improvement of the country s infrastructure  curbed the power of the monarchy to interfere in the assembly by issuing the rule of vote of confidence to any potential prime minister  Greece in the 20th century and beyond King Constantine I with Eleftherios Venizelos  seated  with back to camera  in 1913  during the Balkan Wars  As a result of the Balkan Wars Greece increased the extent of its territory and population  In the following years  the struggle between King Constantine I and charismatic Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos over the country s foreign policy on the eve of World War I dominated the country s political scene  and divided the country into two opposing groups  During part of WWI  Greece had two governments  a royalist pro German government in Athens and a Venizelist pro Britain one in Thessaloniki  The two governments were united in 1917  when Greece officially entered the war on the side of the Triple Entente  In the aftermath of The First World War Greece fought against Turkish nationalists led by Mustafa Kemal  a war which resulted in a massive population exchange between the two countries under the Treaty of Lausanne  32  According to various sources  33  several hundred thousand Pontic Greeks died during this period  34  Instability and successive coups d  tat marked the following era  which was overshadowed by the massive task of incorporating 1 5 million Greek refugees from Turkey into Greek society  The Greek population in Istanbul dropped from 300 000 at the turn of the 20th century to around 3 000 in the city today  35  Following the catastrophic events in Asia Minor  the monarchy was abolished via a referendum in 1924 and the Second Hellenic Republic was declared  Premier Georgios Kondylis took power in 1935 and effectively abolished the republic by bringing back the monarchy via a referendum in 1935  A coup d etat followed in 1936 and installed Ioannis Metaxas as the head of a fascist regime known as the 4th of August Regime  Although fascist  Greece remained in good terms with Britain and was not allied with the Axis  German soldiers raising the German War Flag over the Acropolis of Athens  The symbol of the country s occupation  it would be taken down in one of the first acts of the Greek Resistance  On 28 October 1940 Fascist Italy demanded the surrender of Greece  but Greek dictator Metaxas refused and in the following Greco Italian War  Greece repelled Italian forces into Albania  giving the Allies their first victory over Axis forces on land  The country would eventually fall to urgently dispatched German forces during the Battle of Greece  The German occupiers nevertheless met serious challenges from the Greek Resistance  Over 100 000 civilians died from starvation during the winter of 1941 42  and the great majority of Greek Jews were deported to Nazi extermination camps  36  After liberation  Greece experienced a bitter civil war between communist and anticommunist forces  which led to economic devastation and severe social tensions between rightists and largely communist leftists for the next thirty years  37  The next twenty years were characterized by marginalisation of the left in the political and social spheres but also by rapid economic growth  propelled in part by the Marshall Plan  King Constantine II s dismissal of George Papandreou s centrist government in July 1965 prompted a prolonged period of political turbulence which culminated in a coup d  tat on 21 April 1967 by the United States backed Regime of the Colonels  The brutal suppression of the Athens Polytechnic uprising on 17 November 1973 sent shockwaves through the regime  and a counter coup established Brigadier Dimitrios Ioannidis as dictator  On 20 July 1974  as Turkey invaded the island of Cyprus  the regime collapsed  Former prime minister Konstantinos Karamanlis was invited back from Paris where he had lived in self exile since 1963  marking the beginning of the Metapolitefsi era  On 14 August 1974 Greek forces withdrew from the integrated military structure of NATO in protest at the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus  38  39  The first multiparty elections since 1964 were held on the first anniversary of the Polytechnic uprising  A democratic and republican constitution was promulgated on 11 June 1975 following a referendum which chose to not restore the monarchy  Signing of the documents for the accession of Greece to the European Communities in 1979  Meanwhile  Andreas Papandreou founded the Panhellenic Socialist Movement  PASOK  in response to Karamanlis s conservative New Democracy party  with the two political formations alternating in government ever since  Greece rejoined NATO in 1980  38  Traditionally strained relations with neighbouring Turkey improved when successive earthquakes hit both nations in 1999  leading to the lifting of the Greek veto against Turkey s bid for EU membership  Greece became the tenth member of the European Communities  subsequently subsumed by the European Union  on 1 January 1981  ushering in a period of remarkable and sustained economic growth  Widespread investments in industrial enterprises and heavy infrastructure  as well as funds from the European Union and growing revenues from tourism  shipping and a fast growing service sector have raised the country s standard of living to unprecedented levels  The country adopted the euro in 2001 and successfully hosted the 2004 Summer Olympic Games in Athens  More recently  Greece has been hit hard by the late 2000s recession and central to the related European sovereign debt crisis  The Greek government debt crisis  subsequent economic crisis and resultant  sometimes violent protests have roiled domestic politics and regularly threatened European and world financial market stability in 2010 11  Geography Main articles  Geography of Greece and Regions of Greece Further information  List of cities in Greece and List of islands of Greece

country lies approximately between latitudes 34  and 42  N  and longitudes 19  and 30  E  Greece features a vast number of islands  between 1 200 and 6 000  depending on the definition  41  227 of which are inhabited  Crete is the largest and most populous island  Euboea  separated from the mainland by the 60m wide Euripus Strait  is the second largest  followed by Rhodes and Lesbos  The Greek islands are traditionally grouped into the following clusters  The Argo Saronic Islands in the Saronic gulf near Athens  the Cyclades  a large but dense collection occupying the central part of the Aegean Sea  the North Aegean islands  a loose grouping off the west coast of Turkey  the Dodecanese  another loose collection in the southeast between Crete and Turkey  the Sporades  a small tight group off the coast of Euboea  and the Ionian Islands  located to the west of the mainland in the Ionian Sea  Eighty percent of Greece consists of mountains or hills  making the country one of the most mountainous in Europe  Mount Olympus  the mythical abode of the Greek Gods  culminates at Mytikas peak 2 917 m  9 570 ft   the highest in the country  Western Greece contains a number of lakes and wetlands and is dominated by the Pindus mountain range  The Pindus  a continuation of the Dinaric Alps  reaches a maximum elevation of 2 637 m  8 652 ft  at Mt  Smolikas  the second highest in Greece  and historically has been a significant barrier to east west travel  Navagio  shipwreck  bay  in Zakynthos  The Pindus range continues through the central Peloponnese  crosses the islands of Kythera and Antikythera and find its way into southwestern Aegean  in the island of Crete where it eventually ends  The islands of the Aegean are peaks of underwater mountains that once constituted an extension of the mainland  Pindus is characterized by its high  steep peaks  often dissected by numerous canyons and a variety of other karstic landscapes  The spectacular Vikos Gorge  part of the Vikos Aoos National Park in the Pindus range  is listed by the Guinness book of World Records as the deepest gorge in the world  42  Another notable formation are the Meteora rock pillars  atop which have been built medieval Greek Orthodox monasteries  View of Mount Olympus  located on the border between Thessaly and Macedonia  Topographical map of Greece  Northeastern Greece features another high altitude mountain range  the Rhodope range  spreading across the region of East Macedonia and Thrace  this area is covered with vast  thick  ancient forests  including the famous Dadia forest in the Evros Prefecture  in the far northeast of the country  Extensive plains are primarily located in the prefectures of Thessaly  Central Macedonia and Thrace  They constitute key economic regions as they are among the few arable places in the country  Rare marine species such as the Pinniped Seals and the Loggerhead Sea Turtle live in the seas surrounding mainland Greece  while its dense forests are

locations  including Athens  the Cyclades  the Dodecanese  Crete  the Peloponnese and parts of the Sterea Ellada  Central Continental Grece  region  The Pindus mountain range strongly affects the climate of the country  as areas to the west of the range are considerably wetter on average  due to greater exposure to south westerly systems bringing in moisture  than the areas lying to the east of the range  due to a rain shadow effect   The mountainous areas of Northwestern Greece  parts of Epirus  Central Greece  Thessaly  Western Macedonia  as well as in the mountainous central parts of Peloponnese   including parts of the prefectures of Achaia  Arcadia and Laconia   feature an Alpine climate with heavy snowfalls  The inland parts of northern Greece  in Central Macedonia and East

the dominant language throughout the country  115  The first concrete evidence of the Greek language dates back to 15th century BC and the Linear B script which is associated with the Mycenaean Civilization  Greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world and beyond during Classical Antiquity  and would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire  During the 19th and 20th centuries there was a major dispute known as Greek language question  on whether the official language of Greece should be the archaic Katharevousa  created in the 19th century and used as the state and scholarly language  or the Dimotiki  the form of the Greek language which evolved naturally from Byzantine Greek and was the language of the people  The dispute was finally resolved in 1976  when Dimotiki was made the only official variation of the Greek language  and Katharevousa fell to disuse  Greece is today relatively homogeneous in linguistic terms  with a large majority of the native population using Greek as their first or only language  Among the Greek speaking population  speakers of the distinctive Pontic dialect came to Greece from Asia Minor

 116  and Romani  Romani is also spoken by Christian Roma in other parts of the country  Further minority languages have traditionally been spoken by regional population groups in various parts of the

Vlachs  whose language is closely related to Romanian and who used to live scattered across several areas of mountaneous central Greece  Members of these groups ethnically identify as Greeks 117  and are today all at least bilingual in Greek  Near the northern Greek borders there are also some Slavic speaking groups  locally known as Slavomacedonian speaking  most of whose members identify ethnically as Greeks  Their dialects can be linguistically classified as forms of either Macedonian Slavic or Bulgarian  118  119  It is estimated that in the aftermath of the population exchanges of 1923 there were somewhere between 200 000 and 400 000 Slavic speakers in Greek Macedonia  35  The Jewish community in Greece traditionally spoke Ladino  Judeo Spanish   today maintained only by a

staging ancient Greek plays  The culture of Greece has evolved over thousands of years  beginning in Mycenaean Greece  continuing most notably into Classical Greece  through the influence of the Roman Empire and its Greek Eastern successor the Byzantine Empire  Other cultures and states such as Latin and Frankish states  the Ottoman Empire  the Venetian Republic  Genoese Republic  and British Empire have also left their influence on modern Greek culture  but historians credit the Greek War of Independence with revitalising Greece and giving birth to a single entity of its multi faceted culture  Philosophy Main article  Ancient Greek philosophy Most western philosophical traditions began in ancient Greece in the 6th century BC The first philosophers are called  Presocratics  which designates that they came before Socrates  The Presocratics were from the western or the eastern colonies of Greece and only fragments of the original writings of the presocratics survive  in some cases merely a single sentence  A new period of philosophy started with Socrates  Like the Sophists  he rejected entirely the physical speculations in which his predecessors had indulged  and made the thoughts and opinions of people his starting point  Aspects of Socrates were first united from Plato  who also combined with them many of the principles established by earlier philosophers  and developed the whole of this material into the unity of a comprehensive system  Aristotle of Stagira  the most important disciple of Plato  shared with his teacher the title of the greatest philosopher of antiquity but while Plato had sought to elucidate and explain things from the supra sensual standpoint of the forms  his pupil preferred to start from the facts given us by experience  Except from these three most significant Greek philosophers other known schools of Greek philosophy from other founders during ancient times were Stoicism  epicureanism  Skepticism and Neoplatonism  124  Literature Main articles  Greek Literature and Modern Greek literature Dionysios Solomos wrote the Hymn to Liberty  which became later the national anthem  The timeline of the Greek literature can be separated into three big periods  the ancient  the Byzantine and the modern Greek literature  At the beginning of Greek literature stand the two monumental works of Homer  the Iliad and the Odyssey  Though dates of composition vary  these works were fixed around 800 BC or after  In the classical period many of the genres of western literature became more prominent  Lyrical poetry  odes  pastorals  elegies  epigrams  dramatic presentations of comedy and tragedy historiography  rhetorical treatises  philosophical dialectics  and philosophical treatises all arose in this period The two major lyrical poets were Sappho and Pindar  The Classical era also saw the dawn of drama  Of the hundreds of tragedies written and performed during the classical age  only a limited number of plays by three authors have survived  those of Aeschylus  Sophocles  and Euripides  The surviving plays by Aristophanes are also a treasure trove of comic presentation  while Herodotus and Thucydides are two of the most influential historians in this period  The greatest prose achievement of the 4th century was in philosophy with the works of the three great philosophers  Adamantios Korais Byzantine literature refers to literature of the Byzantine Empire written in Atticizing  Medieval and early Modern Greek  and it is the expression of the intellectual life of the Byzantine Greeks during the Christian Middle Ages  Modern Greek literature refers to literature written in common Modern Greek  emerging from late Byzantine times in the 11th century  The Cretan Renaissance poem Erotokritos is undoubtedly the masterpiece of this period of Greek literature  It is a verse romance written around 1600 by Vitsentzos Kornaros 1553 1613   Later  during the period of Greek enlightenment  Diafotismos   writers such as Adamantios Korais and Rigas Feraios will prepare with their works the Greek Revolution  1821 1830   Leading literary figures of modern Greece include Dionysios Solomos  Andreas Kalvos  Angelos

Greek vocal music extends far back into ancient times where mixed gender choruses performed for entertainment  celebration and spiritual reasons  Instruments during that period included the double reed aulos and the plucked string instrument  the lyre  especially the special kind called a kithara  Music played an important role in the education system during ancient times  Boys were taught music from the age of six  Later influences from the Roman Empire  Middle East and the Byzantine Empire had also effect on Greek music  While the new technique of polyphony was developing in the West  the Eastern Orthodox Church resisted any type of change  Therefore  Byzantine music remained monophonic and without any form of instrumental accompaniment  As a result  and despite certain attempts by certain Greek chanters  such as Manouel Gazis  Ioannis Plousiadinos or the Cypriot Ieronimos o Tragoudistis   Byzantine music was deprived of elements of which in the West encouraged an unimpeded development of art  However  this method which kept music away from polyphony  along with centuries of continuous culture  enabled monophonic music to develop to the greatest heights of perfection  Byzantium presented the monophonic Byzantine chant  a melodic treasury of inestimable value for its rhythmical variety and expressive power  Cretan dancers of traditional music  Along with the Byzantine  Church  chant and music  the Greek people also cultivated the Greek folk song which is divided into two cycles  the akritic and klephtic  The akritic was created between the 9th and 10th centuries  and expressed the life and struggles of the akrites  frontier guards  of the Byzantine empire  the most well known being the stories associated with Digenes Akritas  The klephtic cycle came into being between the late Byzantine period and the start of the Greek War of Independence  The klephtic cycle  together with historical songs  paraloghes  narrative song or ballad   love songs  mantinades  wedding songs  songs of exile and dirges express the life of the Greeks  There is a unity between the Greek people s struggles for freedom  their joys and sorrow and attitudes towards love and death  The Heptanesean kant dhes            serenades   sing            became the forerunners of the Greek modern song  influencing its development to a considerable degree  For the first part of the next century  several Greek composers continued to borrow elements from the Heptanesean style  The most successful songs during the period 1870 1930 were the so called Athenian serenades  and the songs performed on stage                           theatrical revue songs   in revue  operettas and nocturnes that were dominating Athens  theater scene  Rebetes in Karaiskaki  Piraeus  1933   Left Vamvakaris with bouzouki  middle Batis with guitar  Rebetiko  initially a music associated with the lower classes  later  and especially after the population exchange between Greece and Turkey  reached greater general acceptance as the rough edges of its overt subcultural character were softened and polished  sometimes to the point of unrecognizability  It was the base of the later la k   song of the people   Regarding the classical music  it was through the Ionian islands  which were under western rule and influence  that all the major advances of the western European classical music were introduced to mainland Greeks  The region is notable for the birth of the first School of modern Greek classical music  Heptanesean or Ionian School  Greek                     established in 1815  Prominent representatives of this genre include Nikolaos Mantzaros  Spyridon Xyndas  Spyridon Samaras and Pavlos Carrer  Manolis Kalomiris is considered the founder of the Greek National School  In
