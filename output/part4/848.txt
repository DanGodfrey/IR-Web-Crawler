6  1915   October 10  1985  was an American actor  director  writer and producer who worked extensively in theater  radio and film  He is best remembered for his innovative work in all three media  most notably Caesar  1937   a groundbreaking Broadway adaption of Julius Caesar and the debut of the Mercury Theatre  The War of the Worlds  1938   the most famous broadcast in the history of radio  and Citizen Kane  1941   which many critics and scholars name as the best film of all time  After directing a number of high profile theatrical productions in his early twenties  including an innovative adaptation of Macbeth and The Cradle Will Rock  Welles found national and international fame as the director and narrator of a 1938 radio adaptation of H  G  Wells  novel The War of the Worlds performed for the radio drama anthology series Mercury Theatre on the Air  It was reported to have caused widespread panic when listeners thought that an invasion by extraterrestrial beings was occurring  Although these reports of panic were mostly false and overstated  1  they rocketed Welles to instant notoriety  His first film was Citizen Kane  1941   which he wrote  produced  directed  and starred in as Charles Foster Kane  It is often considered the greatest film ever made  Welles was always an outsider to the studio system and directed only 13 full length films in his career  While he struggled for creative control in the face of studios  many of his films were heavily edited and others were left unreleased  His distinctive directorial style featured layered and nonlinear narrative forms  innovative uses of lighting such as chiaroscuro  unusual camera angles  sound techniques borrowed from radio  deep focus shots  and long takes  He has been praised as a major creative force and as  the ultimate auteur   2  In 2002  Welles was voted the greatest film director of all time in two separate British Film Institute polls among directors and critics  3  4  and a wide survey of critical consensus  best of lists  and historical retrospectives calls him the most acclaimed director of all time  5  Well known for his baritone voice  6  Welles was also a well regarded actor and was voted number 16 in AFI s 100 Years    100 Stars list of the greatest American film actors of all time  He was also a celebrated Shakespearean stage actor and an accomplished magician

Springfield  Illinois   May 10  1924  Chicago  Illinois   7  His family was raised Roman Catholic  Despite his parents  affluence  Welles encountered many hardships in childhood  In 1919  his parents separated and moved to Chicago  His father  who had made a fortune as the inventor of a popular bicycle lamp  8  became an alcoholic and stopped working  Welles s mother  a concert pianist  played during lectures by Dudley Crafts Watson at the Chicago Art Institute to support her son and herself  the oldest Welles boy   Dickie   had been institutionalized at an early age because he had learning difficulties   Beatrice died of jaundice in 1924 in a Chicago hospital a few days after Welles s ninth birthday  9  After his mother s death  Welles ceased pursuing his interest in music  He was taken in by Dudley Crafts Watson and lived with the family at Watson s family home   Trillium Dell   on Marshman Avenue in Highland Park  Illinois  At the age of ten  Orson with Watson s third daughter  Marjorie  of the same age   ran away from home  They were found a week later  singing and dancing for money on a street corner in Milwaukee  His father died when Orson was 15 during the summer after Orson s graduation from Todd School for Boys  an independent school in Woodstock  Illinois  Maurice Bernstein  a physician from Chicago  became his guardian  At Todd School  Welles came under the influence of Roger Hill  a teacher who later became Todd s headmaster  Hill provided Welles with an ad hoc educational environment that proved invaluable to his creative experience  allowing Welles to concentrate on subjects that interested him  Welles performed and staged his first theatrical experiments and productions there  Following graduation from Todd  Welles was awarded a scholarship to Harvard University  Rather than enrolling  he chose to travel  Later  he briefly studied for a time at the Art Institute of Chicago  10  He returned a number of times to Woodstock to direct his alma mater s student productions   edit  Early career  1931 1934  After his father s death  Welles traveled to Europe with the aid of a small inheritance  Welles later reported that while on a walking and painting trip through Ireland  he strode into the Gate Theatre in Dublin and claimed he was a Broadway star  The manager of Gate  Hilton Edwards  later said he had not believed him but was impressed by his brashness and some impassioned quality in his audition  11  Welles made his stage debut at the Gate in 1931  appearing in Jew Suss as the Duke  He acted to great acclaim  which reached the United States  He performed smaller supporting roles as well  On returning to the United States he found his fame ephemeral and turned to a writing project at Todd School that would become the immensely successful Everybody s Shakespeare and subsequently  The Mercury Shakespeare  Welles traveled to North Africa while working on thousands of illustrations for the Everybody s Shakespeare series of educational books  a series that remained in print for decades  An introduction by Thornton Wilder led Welles to the New York stage  In 1933  he toured in three off Broadway productions with Katharine Cornell s company  including two roles in Romeo and Juliet  12  Restless and impatient when the planned Broadway opening of Romeo and Juliet was canceled  Welles staged a drama festival of his own with the Todd School  inviting Miche l Mac Liamm ir and Hilton Edwards from Dublin s Gate Theatre to appear  along with New York stage luminaries  It was a roaring success  The subsequent revival of Cornell s Romeo and Juliet brought Welles to the notice of John Houseman  who was casting for an unusual lead actor for the lead role in the Federal Theatre Project  By 1935 Welles was supplementing his earnings in the theater as a radio actor in Manhattan  working with many of the actors who would later form the core of his Mercury Theatre  He married Chicago actress Virginia Nicholson in 1934 and that year he shot an eight minute silent short film  The Hearts of Age with her  The couple had one daughter  Christopher  She made her only film appearance in 1948  taking the role of Macduff s son in Welles s film Macbeth and later became known as Chris Welles Feder  an author of educational materials for children   edit  Theatre and radio  1936 1940   edit  Federal Theatre Project  edit  Macbeth Main article  Voodoo Macbeth Silkscreen poster for Macbeth  Anthony Velonis  In 1936  the Federal Theatre Project  part of Roosevelt s Works Progress Administration  put unemployed theater performers and employees to work  Welles was hired by John Houseman and assigned to direct a play for the Federal Theatre Project s Negro Theater Unit  He offered them Macbeth  13  The production became known as the Voodoo Macbeth  because Welles set it in the Haitian court of King Henri Christophe  with voodoo witch doctors for the three Weird Sisters  Jack Carter played Macbeth  The incidental music was composed by Virgil Thomson  The play opened April 14  1936  at the Lafayette Theatre in Harlem and was received rapturously  It later toured the nation  When the lead actor  Maurice Ellis  fell ill on tour  Welles quickly boarded an airplane to fly to the location and stepped into the part  playing the role in blackface  14  At the age of 20  Welles was hailed as a prodigy  A few minutes of the Welles production of Macbeth was recorded on film in a 1937 documentary called We Work Again  15   edit  Horse Eats Hat Main article  Horse Eats Hat After the success of Macbeth  Welles mounted the farce Horse Eats Hat  an adaptation by Welles and Edwin Denby of Eug ne Labiche s play  Un Chapeau de Paille d Italie  16  The play was presented September 26 December 5  1936  at Maxine Elliott s Theatre  New York  17 Joseph Cotten was featured in his first starring role  18   edit  The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus Welles consolidated his  White Hope  reputation with Dr  Faustus  which used light as a prime unifying scenic element in a nearly blacked out stage  Faustus was presented January 8 May 9  1937  at Maxine Elliott s Theatre  New York  19   edit  The Second Hurricane In 1937 American composer Aaron Copland chose Welles to direct The Second Hurricane  an operetta with a libretto by Edwin Denby that is one of Copland s least known works  Presented at the Henry Street Settlement Music School in New York for the benefit of high school students  the production opened April 21  1937  and ran for its scheduled three performances  20  Among the few adult performers in the production was actor Joseph Cotten  Welles s longtime friend and collaborator  who was paid  10 for his performance  21   edit  The Cradle Will Rock Main article  The Cradle Will Rock Original poster for Project 891 s production of The Cradle Will Rock In 1937  Welles rehearsed Marc Blitzstein s highly political operetta  The Cradle Will Rock  It was originally scheduled to open June 16  1937  in its first public preview  Because of severe federal cutbacks in the Works Progress projects  the show s premiere at the Maxine Elliott Theatre was canceled  The theater was locked and guarded to prevent any of the government purchased materials being used for a commercial production of the work  In a last minute move  Welles announced to waiting ticket holders that the show was being transferred to the Venice  about twenty blocks away  Some cast  as well as some crew and audience  walked the distance on foot  The union musicians refused to perform in a commercial theater for lower non union government wages  The actors  union stated that the production belonged to the Federal Theater Project and could not be performed outside that context without permission  Lacking the participation of the union members  The Cradle Will Rock began with Blitzstein introducing the show and playing the piano accompaniment on stage with some cast members performing their parts from the audience  This impromptu performance was well received by its audience  It afterward played at the Venice for two weeks in the same informal way   edit  Mercury Theatre Main article  Mercury Theatre Resigning from the Federal Theatre  Welles and Houseman formed the Mercury Theatre  of which Welles became executive producer and whose repertory company eventually included actors such as Agnes Moorehead  Joseph Cotten  Dolores del R o  Ray Collins  George Coulouris  Frank Readick  Everett Sloane  Eustace Wyatt and Erskine Sanford  all of whom would continue to work for Welles for years  The first Mercury Theatre production was a melodramatic and heavily edited version of William Shakespeare s tragedy Julius Caesar  set in a contemporary frame of fascist Italy  Cinna the Poet dies at the hands not of a mob but of a secret police force  According to Norman Lloyd  who played Cinna the Poet   it stopped the show   The applause lasted more than ten minutes and the production was widely acclaimed  In the second year of the Mercury Theater  Welles shifted his interests to radio as an actor  director and producer  He played Hamlet for CBS on The Columbia Workshop  while adapting and directing the play  In July 1937  the Mutual Network gave him a seven week series to adapt Les Mis rables  which he did with great success  That September  Mutual chose Welles to play Lamont Cranston  aka The Shadow  anonymously and in the summer of 1938 CBS gave him  and the Mercury Theatre  a weekly hour long show to broadcast radio plays based on classic literary works  The show was titled The Mercury Theatre on the Air  with original music by Bernard Herrmann  who would continue working with Welles on radio and in films for years  An electrical transcription disk of the Orson Welles War of the Worlds broadcast  edit  The War of the Worlds broadcast Main article  The War of the Worlds  radio drama  Their October 30  1938 radio adaptation of The War of the Worlds by H  G  Wells brought Welles instant fame  The combination of the news bulletin form of the performance with the between breaks dial spinning habits of listeners from the rival and far more popular Edgar Bergen Charlie McCarthy program was later reported in the media to have created widespread confusion among listeners who failed to hear the introduction  although the extent of this confusion has recently come into question  1  22  23  Panic was reported to have spread  after citation from rumors  among many listeners who believed the news reports of a Martian invasion  The myth of the result created by the combination was reported as fact around the world and disparagingly mentioned by Adolf Hitler in a public speech a few months later  24  The 1975 docudrama The Night That Panicked America was based on events centering around the production of  and events that resulted from  the program  Welles s growing fame soon drew Hollywood offers  lures which the independent minded Welles resisted at first  The Mercury Theatre on the Air  which had been a  sustaining show   without sponsorship  was picked up by Campbell Soup and renamed The Campbell Playhouse  25  On October 28  1940  Welles met H G  Wells in San Antonio  Texas  a local radio station KTSA recorded the conversation  which was likely the only meeting between the two   edit  Hollywood  1939 1948  RKO Radio Pictures president George Schaefer eventually offered Welles what generally is considered the greatest contract ever offered to an untried director  complete artistic control  RKO signed Welles in a two picture deal  including script  cast  crew  and most importantly  final cut  although Welles had a budget limit for his projects  With this contract in hand  Welles  and nearly the entire Mercury Theatre troupe  moved to Hollywood  He commuted weekly to New York to maintain his commitment to The Campbell Playhouse   DEBATE  Film historians have cast doubt on the accuracy of this claim of complete control  Based on much later access to the said contract  UK film critic Alexander Walker averred  in a BBC radio documentary about Kane  that Welles did NOT have final cut of his films  Something that would seem to be confirmed by RKO s mashing of Welles  follow up movie to Kane   The Magnificent Ambersons     Welles toyed with various ideas for his first project for RKO Radio Pictures  settling on an adaptation of Joseph Conrad s Heart of Darkness  which he worked on in great detail  He planned to film the action with a subjective camera  a technique later used in the Robert Montgomery film Lady in the Lake   When a budget was drawn up  RKO s enthusiasm cooled because it was greater than the previously agreed limit  RKO also declined to approve another Welles project  The Smiler With the Knife  based on the Cecil Day Lewis novel  ostensibly because RKO executives lacked faith in Lucille Ball s ability to carry the film as the leading lady  In a sign of things to come citation needed   Welles left The Campbell Playhouse in 1940 due to creative differences with the sponsor  The show continued without him  produced by John Houseman  In perhaps another sign of things to come citation needed   Welles s first experience on a Hollywood film was narrator for RKO s 1940 production of The Swiss Family Robinson   edit  Citizen Kane Main article  Citizen Kane  edit  Production Orson Welles in Citizen Kane  1941  RKO  having rejected Welles s first two movie proposals  agreed on the third offer  Citizen Kane  for which Welles co wrote  produced  directed  and performed the lead role  26  Welles found a suitable film project in an idea he conceived with screenwriter Herman J  Mankiewicz   who was then writing radio plays for The Campbell Playhouse   Initially entitled The American  it eventually became Welles s first feature film  also his most famous and honored role   Citizen Kane  1941   Mankiewicz based his original notion on an expos  of the life of William Randolph Hearst  whom he knew socially but came to hate  having once been great friends with Hearst s mistress  Marion Davies  Mankiewicz had been banished from her company because of his perpetual drunkenness  Mankiewicz  a notorious gossip  exacted revenge with his unflattering depiction of Davies in Citizen Kane for which Welles bore most of the criticisms  citation needed  Kane s megalomania was modeled loosely on Robert McCormick  Howard Hughes  and Joseph Pulitzer as Welles wanted to create a broad  complex character  intending to show him in the same scenes from several points of view  citation needed  The use of multiple narrative perspectives in Conrad s Heart of Darkness influenced the treatment  Supplying Mankiewicz with 300 pages of notes  Welles urged him to write the first draft of a screenplay under John Houseman  who was posted to ensure Mankiewicz stayed sober  On Welles s instruction  Houseman wrote the opening narration as a pastiche of The March of Time newsreels  Orson Welles explained to Peter Bogdanovich about the writers working separately by saying   I left him on his own finally  because we d started to waste too much time haggling  So  after mutual agreements on storyline and character  Mank went off with Houseman and did his version  while I stayed in Hollywood and wrote mine   26  Taking these drafts  Welles drastically condensed and rearranged them  then added scenes of his own  The industry accused Welles of underplaying Mankiewicz s contribution to the script  but Welles countered the attacks by saying   At the end  naturally  I was the one making the picture  after all who had to make the decisions  I used what I wanted of Mank s and  rightly or wrongly  kept what I liked of my own   27  Charles Foster Kane is based loosely on parts of Hearst s life  Nonetheless  autobiographical allusions to Welles were worked in  most noticeably in the treatment of Kane s childhood and particularly  regarding his guardianship  Welles then added features from other famous American lives to create a general and mysterious personality  rather than the narrow journalistic portrait intended by Mankiewicz  whose first drafts included scandalous claims about the death of the film director Thomas Ince  Once the script was completed  Welles attracted some of Hollywood s best technicians  including cinematographer Gregg Toland  who walked into Welles s office and announced he wanted to work on the picture  Welles later described Toland as  the fastest cameraman who ever lived   26  For the cast  Welles primarily used actors from his Mercury Theatre  He invited suggestions from everyone but only if they were directed through him  Filming Citizen Kane took ten weeks  26   edit  Reaction Mankiewicz handed a copy of the final shooting script to his friend  Charles Lederer  husband of Welles s ex wife  Virginia Nicholson  as well as the nephew of Hearst s mistress  Marion Davies  Gossip columnist Hedda Hopper saw a small ad in a newspaper for a preview screening of Citizen Kane and went  Hopper  realizing immediately that the film was based on features of Hearst s life  reported this back to him and he threatened to give  Hollywood  Private Lives  if that was what it wanted  Thus began the struggle over the attempted suppression of Citizen Kane  Hearst s media outlets boycotted the film  They exerted enormous pressure on the Hollywood film community by threatening to expose fifteen years of suppressed scandals and the fact that most of the studio bosses were Jewish  At one point  the heads of the major studios jointly offered RKO the cost of the film in exchange for the negative and all existing prints  fully intending to burn them  RKO declined and the film was given a limited release  Hearst intimidated theater chains by threatening to ban advertising for any of their other films in any of his papers if they showed Citizen Kane  The film was well received critically  with Bosley Crowther  film critic for the New York Times calling it  close to being the most sensational film ever made in Hollywood   28  By the time it reached the general public  though  the publicity had waned  It garnered nine Academy Award nominations  Orson nominated as a producer  director  writer  and actor   but won only for Best Original Screenplay  shared by Mankiewicz and Welles  Although it was largely ignored at the Academy Awards  Citizen Kane now is hailed as one of the greatest films ever made  Andrew Sarris called it  the work that influenced the cinema more profoundly than any American film since The Birth of a Nation   26  The delay in its release and its uneven distribution contributed to its average result at the box office  making back its budget and marketing  but RKO lost any chance of a major profit  The fact that Citizen Kane ignored many Hollywood conventions also meant that the film confused and angered the 1940s cinema public  Exhibitor response was scathing  most theater owners complained bitterly about the adverse audience reaction and the many walkouts  Only a few saw fit to acknowledge Welles s artistic technique  RKO shelved the film and did not re release it until 1956  During the 1950s  the film came to be seen by young French film critics such as Fran ois Truffaut as exemplifying the  auteur theory   in which the director is the  author  of a film  Truffaut  Godard and others inspired by Welles s example made their own films  giving birth to the Nouvelle Vague  In the 1960s Citizen Kane became popular on college campuses as a film study exercise and as an entertainment subject  Its frequent revivals on television  home video  and DVD have enhanced its  classic  status and ultimately it recouped its costs  The film still is considered by most film critics and historians to be one of the greatest motion pictures in cinema history   edit  The Magnificent Ambersons Main article  The Magnificent Ambersons  film  Welles s second film for RKO was The Magnificent Ambersons  adapted from the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Booth Tarkington  George Schaefer hoped to make money with this film  since he lost money with Citizen Kane  Ambersons already had been adapted for The Campbell Playhouse by Welles  for radio  and he then wrote the screen adaptation  Toland was not available  so Stanley Cortez was named cinematographer  The meticulous Cortez  however  was slow and the film lagged behind schedule and over budget  Prior to production  Welles s contract was renegotiated  revoking his right to control the final cut   edit  Journey into Fear At RKO s request  simultaneously  Welles worked on an adaptation of Eric Ambler s spy thriller  Journey into Fear  which he co wrote with Joseph Cotten  In addition to acting in the film  Welles was also producer  Direction was credited solely to Norman Foster  Welles later stated that they were in such a rush that the director of each scene was determined by whoever was closest to the camera  CBS then offered Welles a new radio series called the Orson Welles Show  It was a half hour variety show of short stories  comedy skits  poetry  and musical numbers  Joining the original Mercury Theatre cast for the show was Cliff Edwards  the voice of Jiminy Cricket   on loan from Walt Disney   The variety format was unpopular with listeners and Welles soon was forced to limit the content of the show simply to telling a one half hour story for the entirety of each episode  citation needed   edit  It s All True Main article  It s All True  film  To further complicate matters during the production of Ambersons and Journey into Fear  Welles was approached by Nelson Rockefeller and Jock Whitney to produce a documentary film about South America  This was at the behest of the federal government s Good Neighbor policy  a wartime propaganda effort designed to prevent Latin America from allying with the Axis powers  Welles saw his involvement as a form of national service  since his physical condition clarification needed  excused him from direct military service  Expected to film the Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro  Brazil  Welles rushed to finish the editing on Ambersons and his acting scenes in Journey into Fear  Ending his CBS radio show  he lashed together a rough cut of Ambersons with Robert Wise  who had edited Citizen Kane  and left for Brazil  Wise was to join him in Rio to complete the film  but never arrived  A provisional final cut arranged via phone call  telegram  and shortwave radio was previewed without Welles s approval in Pomona in a double bill  to a mostly negative audience response  particularly to the character of Aunt Fanny played by Agnes Moorehead  Whereas Schaefer argued that Welles be allowed to complete his own version of the film  and that an archival copy be kept with the Museum of Modern Art in New York City  RKO disagreed  With Welles in South America  there was no practical means of having him edit the film  As a result of the difficult financial circumstances that RKO found itself in across the period 1940 42  major changes occurred at the studio in 1942 29 Floyd Odlum took over control of RKO and began changing its direction  Rockefeller  the most significant backer of the Brazil project  left the RKO board of directors  Around the same time  the principal sponsor of Welles at RKO  studio president George Schaefer  resigned  The changes throughout RKO caused reevaluations of many projects  RKO took control of Ambersons  formed a committee  which was ordered to edit the film into what the studio considered a commercial format  They removed fifty minutes of Welles s footage  re shot sequences  rearranged the scene order  and added a happy ending  Koerner released the shortened film on the bottom of a double bill with the Lupe V lez comedy  Mexican Spitfire Sees a Ghost  Ambersons was an expensive flop for RKO  although it received four Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actress for Agnes Moorehead  Welles s South American documentary  entitled It s All True  budgeted at one million dollars with half of its budget coming from the U S  Government upon completion  grew in ambition and budget while Welles was in South America  While the film originally was to be a documentary on Carnaval  Welles added a new story which recreated the journey of the jangadeiros  four poor fishermen who had made a 1 500 mile  2 400 km  journey on their open raft to petition Brazilian President Vargas about their working conditions  The four had become national folk heroes  Welles first read of their journey in TIME  Their leader  Jacare  died during a filming mishap  RKO  in limited contact with Welles  attempted to rein in the production  Most of the crew and budget were withdrawn from the film  In addition  the Mercury staff was removed from the studio in the U S  Welles requested resources to finish the film  He was given a limited amount of black and white stock and a silent camera  He completed the sequence  but RKO refused to support any further production on the film  Surviving footage was released in 1993  including a rough reconstruction of the  Four Men on a Raft  segment  Meanwhile  RKO asserted in public that Welles had gone to Brazil without a screenplay and that he had squandered a million dollars  Their official company slogan for the next year was   Showmanship in place of Genius    which was taken as a slight against Welles   edit  Director for hire  1943 1946  On returning to Hollywood  Welles found no studios interested in hiring him as a film director after the twin disasters of The Magnificent Ambersons and It s All True  Welles next worked on radio  CBS offered him two weekly series  Hello Americans  based on the research he d done in Brazil  and Ceiling Unlimited  sponsored by Lockheed  a wartime salute to advances in aviation  Both featured several members of his original Mercury Theatre troupe  Within a few months  Hello Americans was canceled and Welles was replaced as host of Ceiling Unlimited by Joseph Cotten  Welles guest starred on a great variety of shows  notably guest hosting Jack Benny shows for a month in 1943  He took an increasingly active role in American and international politics and used journalism to communicate his forceful ideas widely  In 1943  Welles married Rita Hayworth  They had one child  Rebecca Welles  and divorced five years later in 1948  In between  Welles found work as an actor in other directors  films  He starred in the 1944 film adaptation of Jane Eyre  trading credit as associate producer for top billing over Joan Fontaine  He also had a cameo in the 1944 wartime salute Follow the Boys  in which he performed his Mercury Wonder Show magic act and  sawed  Marlene Dietrich in half after Columbia Pictures head Harry Cohn refused to allow Hayworth to perform  In 1944  Welles was offered a new radio show  broadcast only in California  Orson Welles  Almanac  It was another half hour variety show  with Mobil Oil as sponsor  After the success of his stand in hosting on The Jack Benny Show  the focus was primarily on comedy  His hosting on the Jack Benny show included several self deprecating jokes and story lines about his being a  genius  and overriding any ideas advanced by other cast members  The trade papers were not eager to accept Welles as a comedian  and Welles often complained on air about the poor quality of the scripts  When Welles started his Mercury Wonder Show a few months later  traveling to armed forces camps and performing magic tricks and doing comedy  the radio show was broadcast live from the camps and the material took on a decidedly wartime flavor  Of his original Mercury actors  only Agnes Moorehead remained working with him  The series was cancelled by year s end due to poor ratings  While he found no studio willing to hire him as a film director  Welles s popularity as an actor continued  Pabst Blue Ribbon gave Welles their radio series This Is My Best to direct  but after one month he was fired for creative differences  He started writing a political column for the New York Post  again called Orson Welles s Almanac  While the paper wanted Welles to write about Hollywood gossip  Welles explored serious political issues  His activism for world peace took considerable amounts of his time  The Post column eventually failed in syndication because of contradictory expectations and was dropped by the Post   edit  Post war work  1946 1948   edit  The Stranger Left to right  Edward G  Robinson  Richard Long  Loretta Young  Martha Wentworth  Orson Welles  Philip Merivale  Byron Keith and unknown actors in The Stranger  1946  In 1946  International Pictures released Welles s film The Stranger  starring Edward G  Robinson  Loretta Young  and Welles  Sam Spiegel produced the film  which follows the hunt for a Nazi war criminal living under an alias in America  While Anthony Veiller was credited with the screenplay  it had been rewritten by Welles and John Huston  Disputes occurred during the editing process between Spiegel and Welles  The film became a box office success and it helped his standing with the studios  In the summer of 1946  Welles directed a musical stage version of Around the World in Eighty Days  with a comedic and ironic rewriting of the Jules Verne novel by Welles  incidental music and songs by Cole Porter  and production by Mike Todd  who would later produce the successful film version with David Niven  When Todd pulled out from the lavish and expensive production  Welles alone supported the finances  When he ran out of money at one point  he convinced Columbia president Harry Cohn to send him enough to continue the show  and in exchange  Welles promised to write  produce  direct  and star in a film for Cohn for no further fee  The stage show soon failed  due to poor box office  with Welles unable to claim the losses on his taxes  The complicated financial arrangements concerning the show  its losses  and Welles s arrangement with Cohn  resulted in a tax dispute with the IRS  At the same time in 1946 he began two new radio series  The Mercury Summer Theatre for CBS and Orson Welles Commentaries for ABC  While Summer Theatre featured half hour adaptations of some of the classic Mercury radio shows from the 1930s  the first episode was a condensation of his Around the World stage play  and remains the only record of Cole Porter s music for the project  Several original Mercury actors returned for the series  as well as Bernard Herrmann  It only was scheduled for the summer months  and Welles invested his earnings into his failing stage play  Commentaries was a political vehicle for him  continuing the themes from his New York Post column  Again  Welles lacked a clear focus  until the NAACP brought to his attention the case of Isaac Woodard  Welles brought significant attention to Woodard s cause  Soon Welles was being hanged in effigy in the South and theaters refused to show The Stranger in several southern states   edit  The Lady from Shanghai The film Welles was obliged to make for Cohn in exchange for Cohn s help in completing Around the World in Eighty Days ended up being The Lady from Shanghai  filmed in 1947 for Columbia Pictures  Intended to be a modest thriller  the budget skyrocketed after Cohn suggested that Welles s then estranged second wife Rita Hayworth co star  Orson Welles in The Lady from Shanghai  1947  Cohn disliked Welles s rough cut  particularly the confusing plot and lack of close ups  and was not in sympathy with Welles s Brechtian use of irony and black comedy  especially in a farcical courtroom scene  Cohn ordered extensive editing and re shoots  After heavy editing by the studio  approximately one hour of Welles s first cut had been removed  including much of a climactic confrontation scene in an amusement park funhouse  While expressing displeasure at the cuts  Welles was appalled particularly at the musical score  The film was considered a disaster in America at the time of release  though the closing shootout in a hall of mirrors has since become one of the touchstones of film noir  Not long after release  Welles and Hayworth finalized their divorce  Although The Lady From Shanghai was acclaimed

 Welles convinced Republic Pictures to let him direct a low budget version of Macbeth  which featured extremely stylized sets and costumes  and a cast of actors lip syncing to a pre recorded soundtrack  one of many innovative cost cutting techniques Welles deployed in an attempt to make an epic film from B movie resources  The script  adapted by Welles  is a violent reworking of Shakespeare s original  freely cutting and pasting lines into new contexts via a collage technique and recasting Macbeth as a clash of pagan and proto Christian ideologies  Some of the voodoo trappings of the famous Welles Houseman Negro Theatre stage adaptation are also visible  especially in the film s characterization of the Weird Sisters  who create an effigy of Macbeth as a charm to enchant him  Of all Welles s post Kane Hollywood productions  Macbeth is stylistically closest to Citizen Kane in its use of long takes and deep focus photography  Shots of the increasingly isolated Scottish king looming in the foreground while other characters address him from deep in the background overtly reference Kane  citation needed  Republic initially trumpeted the film as an important work but decided it did not care for the Scottish accents on the soundtrack and held up general release for almost a year after early negative press reaction  which included Life s comment that Welles s film  doth foully slaughter Shakespeare   30  Welles left for Europe  while his co producer and life long supporter Richard Wilson reworked the soundtrack  Welles ultimately returned and cut twenty minutes from the film at Republic s request and recorded narration to cover the gaps  The film was decried as another disaster  Macbeth had its share of influential fans in Europe  especially the French poet and filmmaker Jean Cocteau  who hailed the film s  crude  irreverent power  and careful shot design  and described the characters as haunting  the corridors of some dreamlike subway  an abandoned coal mine  and ruined cellars oozing with water   31  In the late 1970s  a fully restored version of Macbeth was released that followed Welles s original vision  and all prints of the truncated theatrical release have gradually been withdrawn from circulation  turning Welles s compulsory recut version which has the distinction of being created by the director himself into something

inaudible  and adding ambient stereo sound effects  which weren t in the original film   The restoration went on to a successful theatrical run in America  but was the subject of great controversy

toying with the editing well into the 1980s  he never completed a version film he was fully satisfied with  and would junk existing footage and shoot new footage   In one case  he had a complete cut

infrequent visitor to the home with Mori  citing the demands of work  In the 1960s and 1970s he shared houses just outside Paris and Madrid with Kodar  Although British tabloids reported his affair with Kodar as early as 1969  which was a factor in his moving permanently to the USA in 1970   both Mori and Beatrice remained oblivious as to Kodar s existence until 1984  Welles set up a home with Mori and Beatrice in Nevada  first in Sedona  then in Las Vegas   ostensibly because the climate would be good for his asthma  But while they lived in Nevada  he spent most of his time in Los Angeles  where he openly shared a house with Kodar  When Mori found out about Kodar in 1984  she threw him out of their Nevada house  and she and Beatrice did not see him for the last year of his life  although they still talked regularly on the telephone  This situation had serious ramifications for the copyright status of his work after his death  Welles left Kodar his Los Angeles home and the rights to his unfinished films  and turned the rest over to Mori  Mori contended that she should have been left everything  and a year after Welles s death  Mori and Kodar finally agreed on the settlement of his will  On the way to their meeting to sign the papers  however  Mori was killed in a car accident  Mori s half of the estate was inherited by Beatrice  who refused to come to an arrangement with Kodar  who she blames for undermining her parents  marriage  Legal wranglings between the two have persisted for over 25 years  leading to complex ongoing legal battles over who owns his unfinished films   legal action by Beatrice has at least three times prevented Welles s last film  The Other Side of the Wind  from being completed  Welles had three daughters from his marriages  Christopher Welles Feder  born 27 March 1938  with Virginia Nicolson   Rebecca Welles Manning  17 December 1944   14 October 2004  with Rita Hayworth   and Beatrice Welles  born 13 November 1955  with Paola Mori   His only known son  British director Michael Lindsay Hogg  Sir Michael Lindsay Hogg  5th baronet   is from Welles s affair with Irish actress Geraldine Fitzgerald  then the wife of Sir Edward Lindsay Hogg  4th baronet  56  In her autobiography  In My Father s Shadow  Welles Feder wrote about being a childhood friend and neighbor of Lindsay Hogg s and always suspecting he might be her half brother  57  After the death of Rebecca Welles Manning in 2004  a man named Marc McKerrow was revealed to be her biological son  and so the direct descendant of Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth  McKerrow s reactions to the revelation and his meeting with Oja Kodar are documented in the 2008 film Prodigal Sons  Some of Welles s claimed familial ties have not held up under scrutiny  Despite the persistent urban legend  promoted by Welles himself  he was not the great grandson of Abraham Lincoln s wartime Secretary of the Navy  Gideon Welles  Perhaps the genesis of the myth dates to a 1970 interview on The Dick Cavett Show during which Welles remarks about his venerable great grandfather Gideon Welles  Orson Welles s father was Richard Head Welles  son of Richard Jones Welles  Gideon Welles had no son by that name  His sons were Hubert  1833 1862   John Arthur  1845 1883   Thomas G   1846 1892   and Edgar Thaddeus Welles  1843 1914   citation needed   edit  Physical characteristics Welles achieved a height of six feet at the age of fourteen  58  Peter Noble s biography describes him as  A magnificent figure of a man  over six feet tall  handsome  with flashing eyes and a gloriously resonant speaking voice  59  According to a 1941 physical exam taken when he was 26  Welles was 6 feet  183 cm  tall and weighed 218 pounds  98 9 kg   His eyes were brown  60  Other sources cite that he was 6 feet 4 inches  193 cm  tall  but the slates from costume tests made during the 1940s show him as 6 feet 1 inch  185 cm   Welles gained a significant amount of weight in his 40s  eventually rendering him morbidly obese  at one point weighing nearly four hundred pounds  181 4 kg   His obesity was severe to the point that it restricted his ability to travel  aggravated other health conditions  including his asthma  and even required him to go on a diet in order to play the famously portly Sir John Falstaff  61  Some have attributed his over eating and drinking to depression over his marginalization by the Hollywood system  62   edit  Religious beliefs In April 1982  Merv Griffin interviewed Welles and asked about his religious beliefs  Welles replied   I try to be a Christian  I don t pray really  because I don t want to bore God   63  After the success of his 1941 film Citizen Kane  Welles announced that his next film would be about the life of Jesus  and that he would play the lead role  However  Welles never got around to making the film  64  He narrated the Christian documentary The Late  Great Planet Earth as well as the 1961 Biblical film about the life of Christ  King of Kings   edit  Politics Welles was politically active from the beginning of his career  He remained a man of the left throughout his life  and always defined his political orientation as  progressive   He was a strong supporter of Franklin D  Roosevelt and the New Deal  and often spoke out on radio in support of progressive politics  In particular  he was an early and outspoken critic of American racism and the practice of segregation  He campaigned heavily for Roosevelt in the 1944 election  For several years  he wrote a newspaper column on political issues and considered running for the U S  Senate in 1946  representing his home state of Wisconsin  a seat that was ultimately won by Joseph McCarthy   In 1970  Welles narrated  but did not write  a satirical political record on the administration of President Richard Nixon entitled The Begatting of the President  In the 2006 book  Whatever Happened to Orson Welles   writer Joseph McBride made several controversial claims about Welles  Though Welles said otherwise during his lifetime  McBride claimed Welles left America in the late 1940s to escape McCarthyism and the Hollywood blacklist  65  McBride also claimed  in spite of the sexual content of Welles s contemporary work  F for Fake and the unfinished Other Side of the Wind which contained an explicit   for the time   sex scene involving Oja Kodar   that Welles was extremely puritanical about sex based on his comment to Peter Bogdanovich that The Last Picture Show was  a dirty movie   66  Welles once told Cahiers du cin ma about sex in film   In my opinion  there are two things that can absolutely not be carried to the screen  the realistic presentation of the sexual act and praying to God   67   edit  Death and funeral On October 10  1985  Welles did his final interview on The Merv Griffin Show  He died several hours later of a heart attack at his home in the Hollywood area of Los Angeles  California  and was found slumped over his typewriter  working on a new film script  68  His death came on the same day as his Battle of Neretva co star Yul Brynner  He would be cremated just two days later  Welles s funeral was the subject of some dissent among his family  It was handled by his estranged widow Paola Mori  she had not seen him since she had thrown him out of their family home a year earlier  and his youngest daughter Beatrice Welles  On the pretext that  daddy left no money for funerals or anything else   Beatrice planned for it to be  a simple affair  which deliberately excluded  Hollywood types   Welles s eldest daughter Chris has written of her horror at arriving in  a slum  district of downtown Los Angeles and finding that the funeral took place in a building that  looked more like a hot sheets motel than a funeral home   and that the funeral was booked in a small  bare  sparsely furnished shabby back room which  had the look of a cheap motel room   and had no music or flowers  No ministers  speakers or ceremony had been organized  and so the mourners simply sat in silence by Welles s cremated remains until Welles s 90 year old former teacher and mentor Roger Hill gave an impromptu eulogy  Paola Mori had refused to allow most of Welles s friends to attend  limiting the mourners to just nine  herself  Welles s three daughters  Roger Hill  and three of Welles s friends  Gary Graver  Prince Alessandro Tasca di Cuto and Greg Garrison   as well as the doctor who had signed Welles s death certificate  Welles s companion for the last 20 years  Oja Kodar  was not invited  nor were either of his ex wives  Regarding the proceedings  Hill exclaimed at the funeral itself  This is awful  Awful   Hill took particular exception to Welles having been cremated to save money  since  Orson never wanted to be cremated  He hated the whole idea of cremation  Thank God he doesn t know what they did to him   69  Welles s ashes were taken to Ronda  Spain  where they were buried in an old well covered by flowers  within the rural property of a long time friend  retired bullfighter Antonio Ord  ez  70   edit  Filmography Main article  Orson Welles filmography  edit  Unfinished projects Welles s reliance on self production meant that many of his later projects were filmed piecemeal or were not completed  Welles financed his later projects through his own fundraising activities  He often also took on other work to obtain money to fund his own films   edit  Don Quixote Main article  Don Quixote  unfinished film  In the mid 1950s  Welles began work on Don Quixote  initially a commission from CBS television  Welles expanded the film to feature length  developing the screenplay to take Quixote and Sancho Panza into the modern age  Filming stopped with the death of Francisco Reiguera  the actor playing Quixote  in 1969  Orson Welles continued editing the film into the early 1970s  At the time of his death  the film remained largely a collection of footage in various states of editing  The project and more importantly Welles s conception of the project changed radically over time  A version of the film was created from available fragments in 1992 and released to a very negative reception   edit  The Merchant of Venice Main article  The Merchant of Venice  unfinished film  In 1969 Welles was given another TV commission to film a condensed adaptation of The Merchant of Venice  71  Although Welles had actually completed the film by 1970 the finished negative was later mysteriously stolen from his Rome production office  72   edit  The Other Side of the Wind Main article  The Other Side of the Wind In 1970 Welles began shooting The Other Side of the Wind  The film relates the efforts of a film director  played by John Huston  to complete his last Hollywood picture and is largely set at a lavish party  By 1972 the filming was reported by Welles as being  96  complete   73  though it is likely that Welles had only edited about 40 minutes of the film by 1979  74  In that year  legal complications over the ownership of the film forced the negative into a Paris vault where it remained until 2004  when Peter Bogdanovich  who also acted in the film  announced his intention to complete the production  As of 2009  legal complications over the Welles estate have kept the film from being finished or released  Some footage is included in the documentaries Working with Orson Welles  1993  and Orson Welles  One Man Band  1995    edit  Other unfinished projects Heart of Darkness  Welles s projected first film in 1940  planned in extreme detail and with some test shots filmed   The footage is now lost   It was planned to be entirely shot in long takes from the point of view of the narrator  Marlow  who would be played by Welles  seeing his own reflection in the window as his boat sailed down river  The project was abandoned because it could not be delivered on budget  and Citizen Kane was made instead  75  It s All True  Welles did not originally want to direct this 1942 documentary on South America  but after its abandonment by RKO  he spent much of the 1940s attempting to buy the negative of his material from RKO  so that he could edit and release it in some form  The footage remained unseen in vaults for decades  and was assumed lost  Over 50 years later  some  but not all  of the surviving material saw release in the 1993 documentary It s All True  Based on an Unfinished Film by Orson Welles  Monsieur Verdoux  In 1944  Welles wrote the first draft script of this film  which he also intended to direct  Charlie Chaplin initially agreed to star in it  but later changed his mind  citing never having been directed by someone else in a feature before  Chaplin bought the film rights and made the film himself in 1947  with some changes  Welles said the gallows scenes were written by Chaplin  but that much of the film was unchanged from his own script   The final film credits Chaplin with the script   based on an idea by Orson Welles   Cyrano de Bergerac  Welles spent around nine months c  1947 8 co writing the screenplay for this along with Ben Hecht  a project Welles was assigned to direct for Alexander Korda  He began scouting for locations in Europe whilst filming Black Magic  but Korda was short of money  so sold the rights to Columbia pictures  who eventually dismissed Welles from the project  and then sold the rights on to United Artists  who in turn made a film version in 1950  which was not based on Welles s script  76  Around the World in Eighty Days  After Welles s elaborate musical stageshow of this Jules Verne novel  encompassing 38 different sets  he began shooting some test footage in Morocco for a film version in 1947  The footage was never edited  funding never came through  and Welles abandoned the project  Nine years later  the stage show s producer Mike Todd made his own award winning film version of the book  77  Moby Dick Rehearsed  a film version of Welles s 1955 London meta play  starring Gordon Jackson  Christopher Lee  Patrick McGoohan  and with Welles as Ahab  Using bare  minimalist sets  Welles alternated between a cast of nineteenth century actors rehearsing a production of Moby Dick  with scenes from Moby Dick itself  Kenneth Williams  a cast member who was apprehensive about the entire project  recorded in his autobiography that Welles s dim  atmospheric stage lighting made some of the footage so dark as to be unwatchable  The entire play was filmed  but is now presumed lost  The recording was made during one weekend at the Hackney Empire theatre  78  Histoires extraordinaires  The producers of this 1968 anthology film  based on short stories by Edgar Allan Poe  announced in June 1967 that Welles would direct one segment based on both  Masque of the Red Death  and  The Cask of Amontillado  for the omnibus film  Welles withdrew in September 1967 and was replaced  The script  written in English by Welles and Oja Kodar  is in the Filmmuseum Munchen collection  79  One Man Band  This Monty Python esque spoof in which Welles plays all but one of the characters  including two characters in drag   was made around 1968 9  Welles intended this completed sketch to be one of several items in a television special on London  Other items filmed for this special   all included in the  One Man Band  documentary by his partner Oja Kodar   comprised a sketch on Winston Churchill  played in silhouette by Welles   a sketch on peers in a stately home  a feature on London gentlemen s clubs  and a sketch featuring Welles being mocked by his snide Savile Row tailor  played by Charles Gray   80  Treasure Island  Welles wrote two screenplays for this in the 1960s  and was eager to seek financial backing to direct it  Eventually  his own screenplay  under the pseudonym of O W  Jeeves  was further rewritten  and formed the basis of the 1972 film version directed by John Hough  in which Welles played Long John Silver  The Deep  An adaptation of Charles Williams  Dead Calm  The picture was entirely set on two boats and shot mostly in close ups  and was filmed off the coasts of Yugoslavia and the Bahamas  between 1966 and 1969  with all but one scene completed  Originally planned as commercially viable thriller  to show that Welles could make a popular  successful film  It was put on hold in 1970 when Welles worried that critics would not respond favourably to this film as his theatrical follow up to the much lauded Chimes at Midnight  and Welles focused instead on F for Fake  It was abandoned altogether in 1973 due to the death of its star Laurence Harvey  The Munich Film Museum holds a restored copy  with title cards filling out the missing scene  81  Saint Jack  In 1978 Welles was lined up by his long time prot g  Peter Bogdanovich  who was then acting as Welles s de facto agent  to direct this adaptation of the 1973 Paul Theroux novel about an American pimp in Singapore  Hugh Hefner and Bogdnovich s then partner Cybill Shepherd were both attached to the project as producers  with Hefner providing finance through his Playboy productions  However  both Hefner and Shepherd became convinced that Bogdanovich himself would be a more commercially viable director than Welles  and insisted that Bogdanovich take over  Since Bogdanovich was also in need of work after a series of box office flops  he agreed  When the film was finally made in 1979 by Bogdanovich and Hefner  but without Welles or Shepherd s participation   Welles felt betrayed and according to Bogdanovich the two  drifted apart a bit   82  Filming The Trial  After the success of his 1978 film Filming Othello made for West German television  and mostly consisting of a monologue to the camera  Welles began shooting scenes for this follow up film  but never completed it  83  What Welles did film was an 80 minute question and answer session in 1981 with film students asking about the film  The footage was kept by Welles s cinematographer Gary Graver  who donated it to the Munich Film Museum  which then pieced it together with Welles s trailer for the film  into an 83 minute film which is occasionally screened at film festivals  The Big Brass Ring  A script of this project was eventually adapted and filmed by George Hickenlooper in 1999 as a play within a film  about Orson Welles s production of the play  Welles s complete screenplay was one of his last projects  written in the early 1980s  During the last years of his life  Welles struggled to get financing for the planned film  however  his efforts at casting Jack Nicholson  Robert Redford  Warren Beatty  Clint Eastwood  Burt Reynolds  and Paul Newman as the main character were unsuccessful  All of the actors turned down the role for various reasons  Cradle Will Rock  Welles planned on writing and directing a film centered around the 1937 staging of The Cradle Will Rock  Rupert Everett was slated to play the young Welles  However  Welles was unable to acquire funding  Tim Robbins later directed a similar film  but it was not based on Welles  script  King Lear  At the time of his death  Welles was in talks with a French production company to direct a film version of the Shakespeare play  in which he would also play the title role  An adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov s novel Ada for which Welles flew to Paris to discuss the project personally with the Russian author   edit  Awards and honors Further information  List of awards and nominations received by Orson Welles The American Film Institute ranked Citizen Kane as

TV show Second City Television was John Candy s impersonation of Welles  On SCTV  Candy as Welles appeared in an embarrassing array of commercials  talk shows  and other low budget productions  It s unknown whether or not Welles ever saw Candy s impersonation  Author Kim Newman has featured Orson Welles as a character in several stories from his Anno Dracula series  Although the character Brain from the animated series Animaniacs and Pinky and the Brain was not initially modeled after Welles  Maurice LaMarche was shown a picture of Brain and tasked with finding a voice for the character
