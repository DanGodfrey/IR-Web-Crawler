I suspected we had something unusual on our hands     Lee Salem  Watterson s editor at Universal  recalling his reaction after seeing Watterson s first submission 1  Calvin and Hobbes was conceived when Bill Watterson  working in an advertising job he detested  4  began devoting his spare time to cartooning  his true love  He explored various strip ideas but all were rejected by the syndicates  United Feature Syndicate finally responded positively to one strip  which featured a side character  the main character s little brother  who had a stuffed tiger  Told that these characters were the strongest  Watterson began a new strip centered on them  5  Though United Feature rejected the new strip  eventually Universal Press Syndicate decided to take it  6  7  The first strip was published on November 18  1985  8  and the series quickly became a hit  Within a year of syndication  the strip was published in roughly 250 newspapers  Before long the strip was in wide circulation outside the United States  By April 1  1987  Watterson and his work were featured in an article in The Los Angeles Times  6 Calvin and Hobbes twice earned Watterson the Reuben Award from the National Cartoonists Society in the Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year category  first in 1986 and again in 1988  He was nominated again in 1992  The Society awarded him the Humor Comic Strip Award for 1988  9  Watterson took two extended breaks from writing new strips  from May 6  1991  to February 1  1992  and from April 4 through December 31  1994  In 1995  Watterson sent a letter via his syndicate to all editors whose newspapers carried his strip  I will be stopping Calvin and Hobbes at the end of the year  This was not a recent or an easy decision  and I leave with some sadness  My interests have shifted however  and I believe I ve done what I can do within the constraints of daily deadlines and small panels  I am eager to work at a more thoughtful pace  with fewer artistic compromises  I have not yet decided on future projects  but my relationship with Universal Press Syndicate will continue  That so many newspapers would carry Calvin and Hobbes is an honor I ll long be proud of  and I ve greatly appreciated your support and indulgence over the last decade  Drawing this comic strip has been a privilege and a pleasure  and I thank you for giving me the opportunity  The 3 160th and final strip ran on Sunday  December 31  1995  8  It depicted Calvin and Hobbes outside in freshly fallen snow  reveling in the wonder and excitement of the winter scene   It s a magical world  Hobbes  ol  buddy    Let s go exploring   Calvin exclaims as they zoom off over the snowy hills on their sled  10  leaving  according to one critic ten years later   a hole in the comics page that no strip has been able to fill   11   edit  Syndication and formatting From the outset  Watterson found himself at odds with the syndicate  which urged him to begin merchandising the characters and touring the country to promote the first collections of comic strips  Watterson refused  To him  the integrity of the strip and its artist would be undermined by commercialization  which he saw as a major negative influence in the world of cartoon art  12  Watterson also grew increasingly frustrated by the gradual shrinking of available space for comics in the newspapers  He lamented that without space for anything more than simple dialogue or sparse artwork  comics as an art form were becoming dilute  bland  and unoriginal  12  13  Watterson strove for a full page version of his strip  in contrast to the few cells allocated for most strips  He longed for the artistic freedom allotted to classic strips such as Little Nemo and Krazy Kat  and he gave a sample of what could be accomplished with such liberty in the opening pages of the Sunday strip compilation  The Calvin and Hobbes Lazy Sunday Book  14  During Watterson s first sabbatical from the strip  Universal Press Syndicate continued to charge newspapers full price to re run old Calvin and Hobbes strips  Few editors approved of the move  but the strip was so popular that they had little choice but to continue to run it for fear that competing newspapers might pick it up and draw its fans away  15  This half page layout can easily be rearranged for full  third  and quarter pages  Upon Watterson s return  Universal Press announced that Watterson had decided to sell his Sunday strip as an unbreakable half of a newspaper or tabloid page  Many editors and even a few cartoonists criticized him 16  for what they perceived as arrogance and an unwillingness to abide by the normal practices of the cartoon business  Watterson had negotiated the deal to allow himself more creative freedom in the Sunday comics  I took a sabbatical after resolving a long and emotionally draining fight to prevent Calvin and Hobbes from being merchandised  Looking for a way to rekindle my enthusiasm for the duration of a new contract term  I proposed a redesigned Sunday format that would permit more panel flexibility  To my surprise and delight  Universal responded with an offer to market the strip as an unbreakable half page  more space than I d dared to ask for   despite the expected resistance of editors  To this day  my syndicate assures me that some editors liked the new format  appreciated the difference  and were happy to run the larger strip  but I think it s fair to say that this was not the most common reaction  The syndicate had warned me to prepare for numerous cancellations of the Sunday feature  but after a few weeks of dealing with howling  purple faced editors  the syndicate suggested that papers could reduce the strip to the size tabloid newspapers used for their smaller sheets of paper      I focused on the bright side  I had complete freedom of design and there were virtually no cancellations  For all the yelling and screaming by outraged editors  I remain convinced that the larger Sunday strip gave newspapers a better product and made the comics section more fun for readers  Comics are a visual medium  A strip with a lot of drawing can be exciting and add some variety  Proud as I am that I was able to draw a larger strip  I don t expect to see it happen again any time soon  In the newspaper business  space is money  and I suspect most editors would still say that the difference is not worth the cost  Sadly  the situation is a vicious circle  because there s no room for better artwork  the comics are simply drawn  because they re simply drawn  why should they have more room  17   edit  Animation Watterson did consider allowing Calvin and Hobbes to be animated  and has expressed admiration for the art form of animation  In a 1989 interview in The Comics Journal he said  If you look at the old cartoons by Tex Avery and Chuck Jones  you ll see that there are a lot of things single drawings just can t do  Animators can get away with incredible distortion and exaggeration     because the animator can control the length of time you see something  The bizarre exaggeration barely has time to register  and the viewer doesn t ponder the incredible license he s witnessed  In a comic strip  you just show the highlights of action you can t show the buildup and release     or at least not without slowing down the pace of everything to the point where it s like looking at individual frames of a movie  in which case you ve probably lost the effect you were trying to achieve  In a comic strip  you can suggest motion and time  but it s very crude compared to what an animator can do  I have a real awe for good animation  12  After this he was asked if it was  a bit scary to think of hearing Calvin s voice   He responded that it was  very scary   and that although he loved the visual possibilities of animation  the thought of casting voice actors to play his characters was uncomfortable  He was also unsure whether he wanted to work with an animation team  as he had done all previous work by himself  12  Ultimately  Calvin and Hobbes was never made into an animated series  Watterson later stated in the Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book that he liked the fact that his strip was a  low tech  one man operation   and took great pride in the fact that he drew every line and wrote every word on his own  18   edit  Merchandising Bill Watterson insists that cartoon strips should stand on their own as an art form  and has resisted the use of Calvin and Hobbes in merchandising of any sort  7  Watterson explained in a 2005 press release  Actually  I wasn t against all merchandising when I started the strip  but each product I considered seemed to violate the spirit of the strip  contradict its message  and take me away from the work I loved  If my syndicate had let it go at that  the decision would have taken maybe 30 seconds of my life  19  Almost no legitimate Calvin and Hobbes merchandise exists outside of the book collections  20  Exceptions produced during the strip s original run include two 16 month calendars  1988 1989 and 1989 1990   and the textbook Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes  21  which has been described as  perhaps the most difficult piece of official Calvin and Hobbes memorabilia to find   22  On July 16  2010 the United States Postal Service released a set of postage stamps honoring five comic strips  one of them Calvin and Hobbes  23  Uclick  the digital division of Andrews McMeel Universal  offers licensed prints of Calvin and Hobbes strips through their website GoComics com  The site  which offers framed prints of dozens of popular comic strips including FoxTrot  Garfield  and Doonesbury advertises the combined print of the first and last Calvin and Hobbes strips as their  most popular Framed Collectible Print   24  The strip s immense popularity has led to the appearance of various counterfeit items such as window decals and T shirts that often feature crude humor  binge drinking and other themes that are not found in Watterson s work  25  Images from one strip in which Calvin and Hobbes dance to classical music at night were commonly used for copyright violations  26  After threat of a lawsuit alleging infringement of copyright and trademark  some sticker makers replaced Calvin with a different boy  while other makers made no changes  27  Watterson wryly commented   I clearly miscalculated how popular it would be to show Calvin urinating on a Ford logo   19   edit  Style and influences Precedents to Calvin s fantasy world can be found in Crockett Johnson s Barnaby  Charles M  Schulz s Peanuts  Percy Crosby s Skippy  Berkeley Breathed s Bloom County  and George Herriman s Krazy Kat  while Watterson s use of comics as sociopolitical commentary reaches back to Walt Kelly s Pogo and Quino s Mafalda  Schulz and Kelly particularly influenced Watterson s outlook on comics during his formative years  7  In addition to philosophical antecedents to Watterson s work  he references preexisting  archetypical cartoon characters as a tool to create empathetic responses in the reader  Echoes of not only Charlie Brown  but also of Dennis the Menace  induce a nostalgic and warmhearted response in the new reader of any Calvin and Hobbes strip  even as the subject matter challenges that viewer to consider its extra comical implications  citation needed  In early strips  the drawings have a flatter  Peanuts like look but show more depth in later strips  citation needed  Notable elements of Watterson s artistic style are his characters  diverse and often exaggerated expressions  particularly those of Calvin   elaborate and bizarre backgrounds for Calvin s flights of imagination  expressions of motion  and frequent visual jokes and metaphors  In the later years of the strip  with more panel space available for his use  Watterson experimented more freely with different panel layouts  art styles  stories without dialogue  and greater use of whitespace  He also makes a point of not showing certain things explicitly  the  Noodle Incident  and the children s book Hamster Huey and the Gooey Kablooie are left to the reader s imagination  where Watterson was sure they would be  more outrageous  than he could portray  28  Watterson s technique started with minimalist pencil sketches drawn with a light pencil  though the larger Sunday strips often required more elaborate work   he then would use a small sable brush and India ink on Strathmore bristol board to complete most of the remaining drawing  He lettered dialogue with a Rapidograph fountain pen  and he used a crowquill pen for odds and ends  29  He used Liquid Paper to correct mistakes  He was careful in his use of color  often spending a great deal of time in choosing the right colors to employ for the weekly Sunday strip  30  When Calvin and Hobbes began there were 64 colors available for the Sunday strips  For the later Sunday strips Watterson had 125 colors as well as the ability to fade the colors into each other  29   edit  Art and academia Watterson used the strip to poke fun at the art world  principally through Calvin s unconventional creations of snowmen but also through other expressions of childhood art  When Miss Wormwood complains that he is wasting class time drawing impossible things  a Stegosaurus in a rocket ship  for example   Calvin proclaims himself  on the cutting edge of the avant garde   31  32  He begins exploring the medium of snow when a warm day melts his snowman  His next sculpture  speaks to the horror of our own mortality  inviting the viewer to contemplate the evanescence of life   In further strips  Calvin s creative instincts diversify to include sidewalk drawings  or  as he terms them  examples of  suburban postmodernism    Watterson also lampooned the academic world  In one example  Calvin writes a  revisionist autobiography   recruiting Hobbes to take pictures of him doing stereotypical kid activities like playing sports in order to make him seem more well adjusted  citation needed  In another strip  he carefully crafts an  artist s statement   claiming that such essays convey more messages than artworks themselves ever do  Hobbes blandly notes   You misspelled Weltanschauung    citation needed  He indulges in what Watterson calls  pop psychobabble  to justify his destructive rampages and shift blame to his parents  citing  toxic codependency   citation needed  In one instance  he pens a book report based on the theory that the purpose of academic writing is to  inflate weak ideas  obscure poor reasoning  and inhibit clarity   titled The Dynamics of Interbeing and Monological Imperatives in Dick and Jane  A Study in Psychic Transrelational Gender Modes  Displaying his creation to Hobbes  he remarks   Academia  here I come   Watterson explains that he adapted this jargon  and similar examples from several other strips  from an actual book of art criticism  33  Overall  Watterson s satirical essays serve to attack both sides  criticizing both the commercial mainstream and the artists who are supposed to be  outside  it  Not long after he began drawing his  Dinosaurs in Rocket Ships  series  Calvin tells Hobbes  Calvin  The hard part for us avant garde post modern artists is deciding whether or not to embrace commercialism  Do we allow our work to be hyped and exploited by a market that s simply hungry for the next new thing  Do we participate in a system that turns high art into low art so it s better suited for mass consumption  Of course  when an artist goes commercial  he makes a mockery of his status as an outsider and free thinker  He buys into the crass and shallow values art should transcend  He trades the integrity of his art for riches and fame      Oh  what the heck  I ll do it      Hobbes   Rolling eyes  That wasn t so hard  The strip for Sunday  May 5  1991 criticized the naming of The Big Bang as unevocative of the wonders behind it  34  The strip coined  Horrendous Space Kablooie   an alternative which has achieved some popularity amongst scientists  particularly in informal discussion and often shortened to  the HSK   35  The term has also been referenced in newspapers  36  37  books  38  and university courses  39  40   edit  Social criticisms With rare exceptions  such as Calvin once stating his desire to grow a beard like the members of ZZ Top  the strip avoids reference to actual people or events  In another case  a strip from April 1988 in which Calvin refers to his dad as the  Gene Siskel of Saturday morning TV  after he loudly expresses his resentment of the banality and morality of the animated cartoon Calvin is watching  Watterson lampoons public decadence and apathy  commercialism  and the pandering nature of the mass media  In one instance  Calvin tells Hobbes about a science fiction story he has read in which machines turn humans into zombie slaves  Hobbes comments about the irony of machines controlling people instead of the other way around  Calvin then exclaims   I ll say  Hey  What time is it   My TV show is on   and sprints back inside to watch it  Another strip depicts Calvin s science fiction story about an extraterrestrial spaceship sucking up Earth s oceans and air  To the cries of the suffocating victims  the aliens reply that this is preferable to the loss of their jobs  Calvin is concerned that his story is too far fetched  to which Hobbes responds   Not enough  really    edit  Characters See also  Secondary characters in Calvin and Hobbes  edit  Calvin Main article  Calvin  Calvin and Hobbes  Calvin  named after the 16th century theologian John Calvin  is an impulsive  creative  imaginative  energetic  very curious  hyper intelligent  hypocritical  selfish  occasionally rude  ill tempered and ultimately kind hearted six year old  whose last name is never mentioned in the strip  41  Despite his poor grades in school  Calvin demonstrates his intelligence through his sophisticated vocabulary and a philosophical mind  Calvin   Dad  are you vicariously living through me in the hope that my accomplishments will validate your mediocre life and in some way compensate for all of the opportunities you botched   Dad   If I were  you can bet I d be re evaluating my strategy   Calvin to his mom  later   Mom  Dad keeps insulting me   He commonly wears his distinctive red and black striped shirt  black pants  and white and magenta sneakers  He also wears a jacket when going to school or when playing in the snow  42  He is an enthusiastic reader of comic books and has a tendency to order items marketed in comic books or on boxes of his favorite cereal  Chocolate Frosted Sugar Bombs  Watterson described Calvin  Calvin is pretty easy to do because he is outgoing and rambunctious  and there s not much of a filter between his brain and his mouth  I guess he s a little too intelligent for his age  The thing that I really enjoy about him is that he has no sense of restraint  he doesn t have the experience yet to know the things that you shouldn t do  43  Calvin also has a sensitive side as well  This is displayed  for example  when he finds a dying raccoon and tries to save it but fails  The scene is made even more poignant by Calvin asking Hobbes not to  go anywhere   and Hobbes solemnly promising he wouldn t   edit  Hobbes Main article  Hobbes  Calvin and Hobbes  From the other characters  perspectives  Hobbes is Calvin s stuffed tiger  From Calvin s point of view  Hobbes is an anthropomorphic tiger  much larger than Calvin and full of independent attitudes and ideas  When the perspective shifts to any other character  readers again see merely a stuffed animal  usually seated at an off kilter angle and blankly staring into space  Watterson explains   When Hobbes is a stuffed toy in one panel and alive in the next  I m juxtaposing the  grown up  version of reality with Calvin s version  and inviting the reader to decide which is truer   7  In more than one strip  Hobbes is shown being washed in a washing machine  a fact Hobbes takes in stride and which Watterson has referred to as  one of the stranger blurrings of what Hobbes is   44  Hobbes  true nature is made more ambiguous by episodes that seem to attribute real life consequences to Hobbes  actions  For example  Hobbes plays a game of pouncing on Calvin the moment he arrives home from school  an act which always leaves Calvin with bruises and scrapes that are evident to other characters  When Calvin is attempting to become  the next Houdini   Hobbes  at Calvin s request  manages to tie Calvin to a chair in such a way that Calvin s father is unable to understand how he could have done it himself  Hobbes is named after the 17th century philosopher Thomas Hobbes  who held what Watterson describes as  a dim view of human nature   33  Hobbes  the tiger  is much more rational and aware of consequences than Calvin  but seldom interferes with Calvin s troublemaking beyond a few oblique warnings  Hobbes is sarcastic when Calvin is being hypocritical about things he dislikes  45  Although the debut strip clearly shows Calvin capturing Hobbes by means of a snare  with a tuna sandwich as the bait   a later comic  August 1  1989  indicates that Hobbes has been with Calvin since Calvin was a baby  Calvin   The whole first half of my life is a complete blank  What on earth did I know that someone wanted me to forget   Hobbes   I seem to recall you spent most of the time burping up   46  Watterson eventually decided that it was not important to establish how Calvin and Hobbes met  33   edit  Calvin s parents Calvin s mother and father are American middle class parents  Like many other characters in the strip  their relatively down to earth and sensible attitudes serve as a foil for Calvin s outlandish behavior  Watterson says some fans were angered by the way Calvin s parents thought of Calvin  This is shown by the fact that Calvin s father claimed that he wanted a dachshund instead of Calvin  and often tries to  deny  that Calvin is his biological son  Mom  You re not sorry we had Calvin  are you  Dad  Are you  Mom  I asked first  Besides  it wasn t all my decision  Dad  All I know is  I offered to buy us a dachshund  but no  you said    Dad  Someday I m going to get my DNA checked to see if he s really my kid  Mom  Take my word for it  Calvin s parents are not above some outrageous behavior of their own  For example  Calvin asks for a cigarette and his mother gives him one to teach him a lesson  Calvin s father tells Calvin sarcastic lies when asked a straight question  and Calvin often believes them  Calvin  Dad  were there dinosaurs when you were a kid  Dad  Oh  sure  your grandfather and I used to put on leopard skins and hunt brontosaurus for all the clan rituals  Mom  after Calvin leaves   Listen buster  I think Calvin s grades are bad enough  don t you  Watterson defends what Calvin s parents do  remarking that in the case of parenting a kid like Calvin   I think they do a better job than I would   Calvin s father is overly concerned with  character building  activities in a number of strips  either in the things he makes Calvin do or in the masochistic eccentricities of his own lifestyle  For example  Calvin s father is shown coming home from an early morning run in the snow  which he follows with a bowl of plain oatmeal  47  Calvin s father is a patent attorney and his mother is a stay at home mom  Both remain unnamed except as  Mom  and  Dad   or pet names such as  honey  and  dear  between themselves  Watterson says   As far as the strip is concerned  they are important only as Calvin s mom and dad   Calvin s Uncle Max was in the strip for a week but could not refer to the parents by name  which was one of the main reasons Max never reappeared  33   edit  Susie Derkins Susie Derkins  the only important character with both a first and last name  is a classmate of Calvin s who lives on his street  Named for the pet beagle of Watterson s wife s family  48  she appeared early in the strip as a new student in Calvin s class  She is polite and studious  with a mild imagination consisting of stereotypical young girl games such as playing house or hosting tea parties with her stuffed animals  However  she is also depicted playing imaginary games with Calvin in which she is a high powered lawyer or politician and he is her househusband  Though both of them hate to admit it  Calvin and Susie have quite a bit in common  For example  Susie is shown on occasion with a stuffed bunny rabbit named  Mr  Bun   and Calvin  of course  has Hobbes  Susie also has a mischievous  and sometimes aggressive  streak  which can be seen when she subverts Calvin s attempts to cheat on school tests by feeding him incorrect answers  or clobbers Calvin when he attacks her with snowballs  Susie also regularly beats Calvin in confrontations such as their water balloon and snowball fights  employing guile or force  Hobbes often openly expresses romantic feelings for Susie  much to Calvin s disgust  Calvin starts a  club   of which he and Hobbes are the only members  that he calls G R O S S   Get Rid Of Slimy girlS  club  and while holding  meetings  in Calvin s treehouse or in the  box of secrecy  in Calvin s room  they usually come up with some way to annoy or socially maim Susie  most of which backfire on them completely  Watterson admits that Calvin and Susie have a nascent crush on each other  and that Susie is inspired by the type of woman whom Watterson himself found attractive and eventually married  33   edit  Secondary characters Calvin also interacts with a handful of secondary characters  These include his babysitter  the school bully  his school teacher and the school principal   edit  Rosalyn Rosalyn is Calvin s babysitter  She takes advantage of his parents  desperation to leave the house and the fact that no one else will babysit for Calvin by demanding advances and raises  In her final appearance in the strip  she at last forces Calvin to behave by using his own haphazard rules against him during a game of Calvinball  She is also probably the only character in the strip whom Calvin really fears  as she does not mince words or actions to get Calvin to behave or go to bed on time  Watterson put her in a Sunday strip early on  never thinking of her as a regular character  But Rosalyn s intimidation of Calvin surprised Watterson  so she came back several times  At one point she was Calvin s swimming instructor  though he was only shown to attend one lesson   edit  Moe Moe is the stereotypical bully character  a large  cruel  dimwitted  six year old who shaves  who shoves Calvin against walls or onto the ground while demanding his lunch money and calling him  Twinky    Shrimp    Twerp   or  Squirt   Moe is the only regular character whose speech is shown in an unusual font  his frequently monosyllabic dialogue is shown in crude  lower case letters  Watterson describes Moe as  every jerk I ve ever known   33   edit  Miss Wormwood Miss Wormwood is Calvin s world weary teacher  named after the junior devil in C  S  Lewis  The Screwtape Letters  She usually either wears a polka dotted dress or a brown dress  and is another character who serves as a foil to Calvin s mischief  Calvin  when in his Spaceman Spiff persona  sees Miss Wormwood as a slimy  often dictatorial alien  Calvin refers to Miss Wormwood s indigestion   It s really gross how she drinks Maalox straight from the bottle    her medication   I wonder if her doctor knows she mixes all those prescriptions   and her smoking habit   Rumor has it she s up to two packs a day  unfiltered    Miss Wormwood reacts to Calvin s behavior by tightly shutting her eyes and thinking  Five years until retirement  repeatedly  Watterson describes her as  an unhappy person  due to her belief in the value of education  49   edit  Mr  Spittle Mr  Spittle is the school principal to whose office Miss Wormwood threatens to send Calvin for his pranks for spanking  Infrequently  Susie also accompanies Calvin to the principal s office  Though his name has only been shown in one story  he has appeared many times including the first story about Calvin s duplicator   edit  Uncle Max Uncle Max is Calvin s paternal uncle  Uncle Max was originally meant as a character who could increase the possibilities of the strip  as Watterson noted   Calvin could go visit Uncle Max      However  Watterson dropped the character after realizing that Max was not a promising character  and after finding it was awkward that Max could not address Calvin s parents by name   edit  Recurring elements There are many recurring gags in the strip  some in  reality  and others in Calvin s imagination  These are as follows   edit  Calvin s roles Main article  Calvin s alter egos  Calvin and Hobbes  Calvin imagines himself as a great many things  including dinosaurs  elephants  jungle farers and superheroes  Three of his alter egos are well defined and recurrent   Spaceman Spiff  is a heroic spacefarer who narrates his experiences in the third person  As Spiff  Calvin battles aliens  typically his parents or teacher  but also sometimes other kids his age  with a ray gun known as a  zorcher   later  death ray blaster  or  atomic napalm neutralizer   a water gun or rubber band  and travels to distant planets  his house  school  or neighborhood   Calvin s self narration as Spaceman Spiff is frequently riddled with alliteration   Zounds  Zorched by Zarches  Spaceman Spiff s crippled craft crashes on planet Plootarg   50   Tracer Bullet   a hardboiled private eye  says he has eight slugs in him   One s lead  and the rest are bourbon     In one story  Bullet is called to a case in which a  pushy dame   Calvin s mother  accuses him of destroying an expensive lamp  broken during an indoor football game between Calvin and Hobbes   Later  he is snatched by the pushy dame s  hired goon   Calvin s father having a talk with him   He made his debut when Calvin donned a fedora to hide a haircut Hobbes had given him  These strips are drawn in elaborate  shadowy black and white  As  Stupendous Man  he pictures himself as a superhero in disguise  wearing a mask and a cape made by his mother  and narrating his own adventures  While in character as Stupendous Man  he refers to his alter ego as a mild mannered millionaire playboy  Stupendous Man almost always  suffers defeat  at the hands of his opponent  When Hobbes asks if Stupendous Man has ever won any battles  Calvin says all his battles are  moral victories   Stupendous Man s nemeses include  Mom Lady   Calvin s mom    Annoying Girl   Susie Derkins    Crab Teacher   Miss Wormwood   and  Baby Sitter Girl   Rosalyn   Some of the  super powers  of the villains have been revealed  Mom Lady has a  mind scrambling eyeball ray  that wills the victim to  do her nefarious bidding   and Baby Sitter Girl has a similar power of using a  psycho beam  which weakens  Stupendous Man s stupendous will   The  powers  of Annoying Girl and Crab Teacher are unknown  Calvin often tries to pretend he and  Stupendous Man  are two different people  but it never seems to work  Stupendous Man has multiple  superpowers   including but not limited to  super strength  the ability to fly  and a stomach of steel   edit  Cardboard boxes Calvin duplicating himself using a cardboard box  as seen on the cover of Scientific Progress Goes  Boink  Over the years Calvin has had several adventures involving corrugated cardboard boxes  which he adapts for many different uses  In one strip  during which Calvin shows off his Transmogrifier  a device that transforms its user into any desired shape  Hobbes remarks   It s amazing what they do with corrugated cardboard these days   51  Calvin is able to change the function of the boxes by rewriting the label and flipping the box onto another side  In this way  a cardboard box can be used not only for its conventional purposes  a storage container for water balloons  for example   but also as a flying time machine and a duplicator  In addition  Calvin uses a cardboard box as a desk when he is attempting to sell things  Often  Calvin s merchandise is something that no one would want  such as  suicide drink    a swift kick in the butt  for one dollar  insurance  52  or  frank appraisal of your looks  for fifty cents  In one strip  he sells  happiness  for ten cents  which was a water balloon in the face  revealing that Calvin meant his own happiness  In another strip  he sold  insurance   firing a slingshot at those who refused  The box has also functioned as a secret meeting place for G R O S S   as the  Box of Secrecy    edit  Calvinball Other kids  games are all such a bore They ve gotta have rules and they gotta keep score Calvinball is better by far It s never the same  It s always bizarre You don t need a team or a referee You know that it s great   cause it s named after me   Part of the Calvinball theme song 53  Calvinball is a game played by Calvin and Hobbes as a rebellion against organized team sports  according to Hobbes   No sport is less organized than Calvinball   54  Calvinball was first introduced to the readers at the end of a 1990 storyline involving Calvin reluctantly joining recess baseball  It quickly became a staple of the comic afterwards  The only hint at the true creation of the game ironically comes from the last Calvinball strip  in which a game of football quickly devolves into a game of Calvinball  Calvin remarks that  sooner or later  all our games turn into Calvinball   55  suggesting a similar scenario that directly led to the creation of the sport  Calvin and Hobbes usually play by themselves  although in one storyline Rosalyn  Calvin s baby sitter  plays in return for Calvin doing his homework  and plays very well once she realizes that the rules are made up on the spot  56  The only consistent rule states that Calvinball may never be played with the same rules twice  57  Scoring is also arbitrary  with Hobbes at times reporting scores of  Q to 12  and  oogy to boogy   58  The only recognizable sports Calvinball resembles are the ones it emulates  i e   a cross between croquet  polo  badminton  capture the flag  and volleyball   Equipment includes a volleyball  the eponymous  Calvinball    a croquet set  a badminton set  assorted flags  bags  signs  a hobby horse  and enigmatic and never pictured  time fracture wickets   Other things appear as needed  such as a bucket of ice cold water  a water balloon  and various songs and poetry  59  Players also wear masks resembling blindfolds with holes for the eyes  When Rosalyn asks Calvin the reason for the requirement  Calvin responds   Sorry  no one s allowed to question the masks   56  When asked how to play  Watterson states   It s pretty simple  you make up the rules as you go   60  Calvinball is a nomic or self modifying game  a contest of wits and creativity rather than stamina or athletic skill  in which Hobbes  and on one occasion  Rosalyn  usually outwits Calvin  who takes it in stride  in contrast to his otherwise poor sportsmanship   edit  Snow sculptures Calvin often creates horrendous dark humor scenes with his snowmen  He uses the snowman for social commentary  revenge  or pure enjoyment  Examples include Snowman Calvin being yelled at by Snowman Dad to shovel the snow  Snowman A eating snowcones taken from Snowman B  who is lying on the ground with an ice cream scoop in his back  a snowman house of horror  and snowmen representing the people he hates   The ones I really hate are small  so they ll go faster   he says  There was even a time he accidentally brought a snowman to life and it made itself and a small army into  deranged mutant killer monster snow goons   Calvin s snow art is often used as a commentary on art in general  For example  Calvin has complained more than once about the lack of originality in other people s snow art and compared it with his own grotesque snow sculptures  In one of these instances  Calvin and Hobbes claim to be the sole guardians of high culture  in another  Hobbes admires Calvin s willingness to put artistic integrity above marketability  causing Calvin to reconsider and make an ordinary snowman   edit  Wagon and sled Calvin and Hobbes frequently ride downhill in a wagon  sled  or toboggan  depending on the season  as a device to add some physical comedy to the strip and because  according to Watterson   it s a lot more interesting     than talking heads   61  While the ride is sometimes the focus of the strip  62  it also frequently serves as a counterpoint or visual metaphor while Calvin ponders the meaning of life  death  God  or a variety of other weighty subjects  61  63  Many of their rides end in spectacular crashes which leave them battered and broken  a fact which convinces Hobbes to sometimes hop off before a ride even begins  64  In the final strip  Calvin and Hobbes depart on their toboggan to go exploring  10  This theme is similar  perhaps even homage to  scenarios in Walt Kelly s Pogo   edit  G R O S S  G R O S S   which stands for Get Rid Of Slimy girlS  is a club which consists only of two members  Calvin and Hobbes  The club was created in the garage of their house  which led to the pushing and crashing of Calvin s parents  car  thus changing the club s location to Calvin s treehouse  They hold meetings to attempt to annoy Susie Derkins  Notable actions include planting a fake secret tape near her in attempt to draw her in to a trap  trapping her in a closet at their house  and creating elaborate water balloon traps  Calvin gave himself and Hobbes important positions in the club  Calvin being  Dictator for Life  and Hobbes being  President and First Tiger   They go into Calvin s treehouse for their club meetings and often get into fights during them  The password to get into the treehouse is intentionally long and difficult  which has on at least one occasion ruined Calvin s plans  An example of this can be seen in the comic strip where Calvin  rushing to get into the treehouse to throw things at a passing Susie Derkins  insults Hobbes  who is in the treehouse and thus has to let down the rope  Hobbes forces Calvin to say the password for insulting him  By the time Susie arrives  in time to hear Calvin saying some of the password  causing him to stumble  Calvin is on  Verse Seven  Tigers are perfect the E pit o me of good looks and grace and quiet  uh  um  dignity   The opportunity having passed to pelt Susie with something  Calvin threatens to turn Hobbes into a rug  65   edit  Books Main article  List of Calvin and Hobbes books The first Calvin and Hobbes treasury  There are 18 Calvin and Hobbes books  published from 1987 to 2005  These include 11 collections  which form a complete archive of the newspaper strips  except for a single daily strip from November 28  1985   The collections do contain a strip for this date  but it is not the same strip that appeared in some newspapers  The alternate strip  a joke about Hobbes taking a bath in the washing machine  has circulated around the Internet   66  Treasuries usually combine the two preceding collections with bonus material and include color reprints of Sunday comics  Watterson included some new material in the treasuries  In The Essential Calvin and Hobbes  which includes cartoons from the collections Calvin and Hobbes and Something Under the Bed Is Drooling  the back cover features a scene of a giant Calvin rampaging through a town  The scene is based on Watterson s home town of Chagrin Falls  Ohio  and Calvin is holding the Chagrin Falls Popcorn Shop  an iconic candy and ice cream shop overlooking the town s namesake falls  67  Several of the treasuries incorporate additional poetry  The Indispensable Calvin and Hobbes book features a set of poems  ranging from just a few lines to an entire page  that cover topics such as Calvin s mother s  hindsight  and exploring the woods  In The Essential Calvin and Hobbes  Watterson presents a long poem explaining a night s battle against a monster from Calvin s perspective  A complete collection of Calvin and Hobbes strips  in three hardcover volumes totaling 1440 pages  was released on October 4  2005  by Andrews McMeel Publishing  It includes color prints of the art used on paperback covers  the treasuries  extra illustrated stories and poems  and a new introduction by Bill Watterson in which he talks about his inspirations and his story leading up to the publication of the strip  The alternate 1985 strip is still omitted  and two other strips  January 7  1987  and November 25  1988  have altered dialogue  68  69  70  To celebrate the release  which coincided with the strip s 20th anniversary and the tenth anniversary of its absence from newspapers   Calvin and Hobbes reruns were made available to newspapers from Sunday  September 4  2005  through Saturday  December 31  2005  71  72  and Bill Watterson answered 15 questions submitted by readers  19  Early books were printed in smaller format in black and white  These were later reproduced in twos in color in the  Treasuries   Essential  Authoritative  and Indispensable   except for the contents of Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons  Those Sunday strips were not reprinted in color until the Complete collection was finally published in 2005  Every book since Snow Goons has been printed in a larger format with Sundays in color and weekday and Saturday strips larger than they appeared in most newspapers  citation needed  Watterson claims he named the books the  Essential  Authoritative  and Indispensable  because  as he says in The Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book  the books are  obviously none of these things    edit  Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes Main article  Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes An officially licensed children s textbook entitled Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes was published in a single print run in 1993  21  The book  which has been  highly recommend ed   as a teaching resource  73  includes five complete Calvin and Hobbes multi strip story arcs together with lessons and questions to follow  such as  What do you think the principal meant when he said they had  quite a file  on Calvin  21  The book is very rare and increasingly sought by collectors  22  74  75   edit  Academic response In her book When Toys Come Alive  Lois Rostow Kuznets says that Hobbes serves both as a figure of Calvin s childish fantasy life and as an outlet for the expression of libidinous desires more associated with adults  Kuznets also looks at Calvin s other fantasies  suggesting that they are a second tier of fantasies utilized in places like school where transitional objects such as Hobbes would not be socially acceptable  76  Another academic critic  Philip Sandifer  using the psychoanalytic theories of Jacques Lacan  identifies the strip s depiction of time within Calvin s real and imaginary worlds as a manifestation of the Lacanian concepts of the Imaginary  the Real  and the Symbolic  77  A collection of original Sunday strips was exhibited at Ohio State University s Billy Ireland Cartoon Library  amp  Museum in 2001  Watterson himself selected the strips and provided his own commentary for the exhibition catalog  which was later published by AndrewsMcMeel as Calvin and Hobbes Sunday Pages 1985 1995  78  Since the discontinuation of Calvin and Hobbes  individual strips have been licensed for reprint in schoolbooks  including the Christian homeschooling book The Fallacy Detective in 2002  79  and the university level philosophy reader Open Questions  Readings for Critical Thinking and Writing in 2005  in the latter  the ethical views of Watterson and his characters Calvin and Hobbes are discussed in relation to the views of professional philosophers  80  Academics and other intellectuals were interviewed for a September 9  2009 BBC Radio 4 half hour documentary about the comic strip  narrated by Phill Jupitus  81  Paleontologist and paleoartist Gregory S  Paul praised Bill Watterson for the scientific accuracy of the dinosaurs appearing in Calvin  amp  Hobbes  82   edit
