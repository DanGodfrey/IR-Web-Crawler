three distinct past and present far right 4  5  6  7  organizations in the United States  which have advocated extremist reactionary currents such as white supremacy  white nationalism  and anti immigration  historically expressed through terrorism  8  Since the mid 20th century  the KKK has also been anti communist  8  The current manifestation is splintered into several chapters with no connections with each other  it is classified as a hate group  9  The first Klan flourished in the South in the late 1860s  then died out by the early 1870s  Members adopted white costumes  robes  masks  and conical hats  designed to be outlandish and terrifying  and to hide their identities  10  The second KKK flourished nationwide in the early and mid 1920s  and adopted the same costumes and code words as the first Klan  while introducing cross burnings  11  The third KKK emerged after World War II and was associated with opposing the Civil Rights Movement and progress among minorities  The second and third incarnations of the Ku Klux Klan made frequent reference to the USA s  Anglo Saxon  and  Celtic  blood  harking back to 19th century nativism and claiming descent from the original 18th century British colonial revolutionaries  12  The first and third incarnations of the Klan have well established records of engaging in terrorism and political violence  though historians debate whether or not the tactic was supported by the second KKK  Contents 1 Three Klans 1 1 First KKK 1 2 Second KKK 1 3 Third KKK 2 First Klan 1865 1874 2 1 Creation and naming 2 2

in Pulaski  Tennessee  by six veterans of the Confederate Army  13  They named it after the Greek word kuklos  which means circle  The name means  Circle of Brothers   14  Although there was no organizational structure above the local level  similar groups arose across the South  adopting the name and methods  15  Klan groups spread throughout the South as an insurgent movement during the Reconstruction era in the United States  As a secret vigilante group  the Klan targeted freedmen and their allies  it sought to restore white supremacy by threats and violence  including murder  against black and white Republicans  In 1870 and 1871  the federal government passed the Force Acts  which were used to prosecute Klan crimes  16  Prosecution of Klan crimes and enforcement of the Force Acts suppressed Klan activity  In 1874 and later  however  newly organized and openly active paramilitary organizations  such as the White League and the Red Shirts  started a fresh round of violence aimed at suppressing blacks  voting and running Republicans out of office  These contributed to segregationist white Democrats regaining political power in all the Southern states by 1877  Second KKK In 1915  the second Klan was founded in Georgia  Starting in 1921  it adopted a modern business system of recruiting  which paid most of the initiation fee and costume charges to the organizers  and grew rapidly nationwide at a time of prosperity  Reflecting the social tensions of urban industrialization and vastly increased immigration  its membership grew most rapidly in cities  and spread to the Midwest and West out of the South  The second KKK preached  One Hundred Percent Americanism  demanded the purification of politics  calling for strict morality and better enforcement of prohibition  Its official rhetoric focused on the threat of the Catholic Church  using anti Catholicism and nativism  17  Its appeal was directed exclusively at white Protestants  18  Some local groups took part in attacks on private houses and carried out other violent activities  The violent episodes were generally in the South  19  The second Klan was a formal fraternal organization  with a national and state structure  At its peak in the mid 1920s  the organization claimed to include about 15  of the nation s eligible population  approximately 4 5 million men  Internal divisions  criminal behavior by leaders  and external opposition brought about a collapse in membership  which had dropped to about 30 000 by 1930  It finally faded away in the 1940s  20  Klan organizers also operated in Canada  especially in Saskatchewan in 1926 28  where it attacked immigrants from Eastern Europe  21  Third KKK The  Ku Klux Klan  name was used by many independent local groups opposing the Civil Rights Movement and desegregation  especially in the 1950s and 1960s  During this period  they often forged alliances with Southern police departments  as in Birmingham  Alabama  or with governor s offices  as with George Wallace of Alabama  22  Several members of KKK groups were convicted of murder in the deaths of civil rights workers and children in the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham  Today  researchers estimate that there may be approximately 150 Klan chapters with upwards of 5 000 members nationwide  23  Today  a large majority of sources consider the Klan to be a  subversive or terrorist organization   23  24  25  26  In 1999  the city council of Charleston  South Carolina passed a resolution declaring the Klan to be a terrorist organization  27  A similar effort was made in 2004 when a professor at the University of Louisville began a campaign to have the Klan declared a terrorist organization so it could be banned from campus  28  In April 1997  FBI agents arrested four members of the True Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Dallas for conspiracy to commit robbery and to blow up a natural gas processing plant  29  First Klan 1865 1874 Creation and naming A cartoon threatening that the KKK would lynch carpetbaggers  From the Independent Monitor  Tuscaloosa  Alabama  1868  Six well educated Confederate veterans from Pulaski  Tennessee  created the original Ku Klux Klan on December 24  1865  during Reconstruction of the South after the Civil War  30  31  The name was formed by combining the Greek kyklos          circle  with clan  32  The group was known for a short time as the  Kuklux Clan   The Ku Klux Klan was one among a number of secret  oath bound organizations using violence  including the Southern Cross in New Orleans  1865  and the Knights of the White Camelia  1867  in Louisiana  33  Historians generally see the KKK as part of the post Civil War insurgent violence related not only to the high number of veterans in the population  but also to their effort to control the dramatically changed social situation by using extrajudicial means to restore white supremacy  In 1866  Mississippi Governor William L  Sharkey reported that disorder  lack of control and lawlessness were widespread  in some states armed bands of Confederate soldiers roamed at will  The Klan used public violence against blacks as intimidation  They burned houses  and attacked and killed blacks  leaving their bodies on the roads  34  A political cartoon depicting the KKK and the Democratic Party as continuations of the Confederacy In an 1867 meeting in Nashville  Tennessee  Klan members gathered to try to create a hierarchical organization with local chapters eventually reporting up to a national headquarters  Since most of the Klan s members were veterans  they were used to the hierarchical structure of the organization  but the Klan never operated under this centralized structure  Local chapters and bands were highly independent  Former Confederate Brigadier General George Gordon developed the Prescript  or Klan dogma  The Prescript suggested elements of white supremacist belief  For instance  an applicant should be asked if he was in favor of  a white man s government    the reenfranchisement and emancipation of the white men of the South  and the restitution of the Southern people to all their rights   35  The latter is a reference to the Ironclad Oath  which stripped the vote from white persons who refused to swear that they had not borne arms against the Union  Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest became Grand Wizard  claiming to be the Klan s national leader  13  36  Nathan Bedford Forrest In an 1868 newspaper interview  Forrest stated that the Klan s primary opposition was to the Loyal Leagues  Republican state governments  people like Tennessee governor Brownlow and other carpetbaggers and scalawags  He argued that many southerners believed that blacks were voting for the Republican Party because they were being hoodwinked by the Loyal Leagues  37  One Alabama newspaper editor declared  The League is nothing more than a nigger Ku Klux Klan   38  Despite Gordon s and Forrest s work  local Klan units never accepted the Prescript and continued to operate autonomously  There were never hierarchical levels or state headquarters  Klan members used violence to settle old feuds and local grudges  as they worked to restore white dominance in the disrupted postwar society  The historian Elaine Frantz Parsons describes the membership  Lifting the Klan mask revealed a chaotic multitude of antiblack vigilante groups  disgruntled poor white farmers  wartime guerrilla bands  displaced Democratic politicians  illegal whiskey distillers  coercive moral reformers  sadists  rapists  white workmen fearful of black competition  employers trying to enforce labor discipline  common thieves  neighbors with decades old grudges  and even a few freedmen and white Republicans who allied with Democratic whites or had criminal agendas of their own  Indeed  all they had in common  besides being overwhelmingly white  southern  and Democratic  was that they called themselves  or were called  Klansmen  39  Historian Eric Foner observed  In effect  the Klan was a military force serving the interests of the Democratic party  the planter class  and all those who desired restoration of white supremacy  Its purposes were political  but political in the broadest sense  for it sought to affect power relations  both public and private  throughout Southern society  It aimed to reverse the interlocking changes sweeping over the South during Reconstruction  to destroy the Republican party s infrastructure  undermine the Reconstruction state  reestablish control of the black labor force  and restore racial subordination in every aspect of Southern life  40  Wikisource has original text related to this article  Interview with Nathan Bedford Forrest To that end they worked to curb the education  economic advancement  voting rights  and right to keep and bear arms of blacks  40  The Ku Klux Klan soon spread into nearly every southern state  launching a  reign of terror against Republican leaders both black and white  Those political leaders assassinated during the campaign included Arkansas Congressman James M  Hinds  three members of the South Carolina legislature  and several men who served in constitutional conventions   41  Activities Three Ku Klux Klan members arrested in Tishomingo County  Mississippi  September 1871  for the attempted murder of an entire family  Wikisource has original text related to this article  Why the Ku Klux Klan members adopted masks and robes that hid their identities and added to the drama of their night rides  their chosen time for attacks  Many of them operated in small towns and rural areas where people otherwise knew each other s faces  and sometimes still recognized the attackers   The kind of thing that men are afraid or ashamed to do openly  and by day  they accomplish secretly  masked  and at night   With this method both the high and the low could be attacked  42  The Ku Klux Klan night riders  sometimes claimed to be ghosts of Confederate soldiers so  as they claimed  to frighten superstitious blacks  Few freedmen took such nonsense seriously   43  The Klan attacked black members of the Loyal Leagues and intimidated southern Republicans and Freedmen s Bureau workers  When they killed black political leaders  they also took heads of families  along with the leaders of churches and community groups  because these people had many roles in society  Agents of the Freedmen s Bureau reported weekly assaults and murders of blacks   Armed guerrilla warfare killed thousands of Negroes  political riots were staged  their causes or occasions were always obscure  their results always certain  ten to one hundred times as many Negroes were killed as whites   Masked men shot into houses and burned them  sometimes with the occupants still inside  They drove successful black farmers off their land   Generally  it can be reported that in North and South Carolina  in 18 months ending in June 1867  there were 197 murders and 548 cases of aggravated assault   44  Klan violence worked to suppress black voting  More than 2 000 persons were killed  wounded and otherwise injured in Louisiana within a few weeks prior to the Presidential election of November 1868  Although St  Landry Parish had a registered Republican majority of 1 071  after the murders  no Republicans voted in the fall elections  White Democrats cast the full vote of the parish for Grant s opponent  The KKK killed and wounded more than 200 black Republicans  hunting and chasing them through the woods  Thirteen captives were taken from jail and shot  a half buried pile of 25 bodies was found in the woods  The KKK made people vote Democratic and gave them certificates of the fact  45  In the April 1868 Georgia gubernatorial election  Columbia County cast 1 222 votes for Republican Rufus Bullock  By the November presidential election  however  Klan intimidation led to suppression of the Republican vote and only one person voted for Ulysses S  Grant  46  Klansmen killed more than 150 African Americans in a county in Florida  and hundreds more in other counties  Freedmen s Bureau records provided a detailed recounting of Klansmen s beatings and murders of freedmen and their white allies  47  Milder encounters also occurred  In Mississippi  according to the Congressional inquiry  48  One of these teachers  Miss Allen of Illinois   whose school was at Cotton Gin Port in Monroe County  was visited     between one and two o clock in the morning on March 1871  by about fifty men mounted and disguised  Each man wore a long white robe and his face was covered by a loose mask with scarlet stripes  She was ordered to get up and dress which she did at once and then admitted to her room the captain and lieutenant who in addition to the usual disguise had long horns on their heads and a sort of device in front  The lieutenant had a pistol in his hand and he and the captain sat down while eight or ten men stood inside the door and the porch was full  They treated her  gentlemanly and quietly  but complained of the heavy school tax  said she must stop teaching and go away and warned her that they never gave a second notice  She heeded the warning and left the county  By 1868  two years after the Klan s creation  its activity was beginning to decrease  49  Members were hiding behind Klan masks and robes as a way to avoid prosecution for freelance violence  Many influential southern Democrats feared that Klan lawlessness provided an excuse for the federal government to retain its power over the South  and they began to turn against it  50  There were outlandish claims made  such as Georgian B  H  Hill stating  that some of these outrages were actually perpetrated by the political friends of the parties slain   49  Resistance Union Army veterans in mountainous Blount County  Alabama  organized  the anti Ku Klux   They put an end to violence by threatening Klansmen with reprisals unless they stopped whipping Unionists and burning black churches and schools  Armed blacks formed their own defense in Bennettsville  South Carolina and patrolled the streets to protect their homes  51  National sentiment gathered to crack down on the Klan  even though some Democrats at the national level questioned whether the Klan really existed or believed that it was just a creation of nervous Southern Republican governors  52  Many southern states began to pass anti Klan legislation  Wikisource has original text related to this article  Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 In January 1871  Pennsylvania Republican Senator John Scott convened a Congressional committee which took testimony from 52 witnesses about Klan atrocities  They accumulated 12 volumes of horrifying testimony  In February  former Union General and Congressman Benjamin Franklin Butler of Massachusetts introduced the Civil Rights Act of 1871  Ku Klux Klan Act   This added to the enmity that southern white Democrats bore toward him  53  While the bill was being considered  further violence in the South swung support for its passage  The Governor of South Carolina appealed for federal troops to assist his efforts in keeping control of the state  A riot and massacre in a Meridian  Mississippi  courthouse were reported  from which a black state representative escaped only by taking to the woods  54  The 1871 Civil Rights Act allowed President Ulysses S  Grant to suspend Habeas Corpus  55  Benjamin Franklin Butler wrote the Civil Rights Act of 1871  Klan Act  In 1871  President Ulysses S  Grant signed Butler s legislation  The Ku Klux Klan Act was used by the Federal government together with the 1870 Force Act  another act that President Grant signed  to enforce the civil rights provisions for individuals under the constitution  Under the 1871 Klan Act  after the Klan refused to voluntarily dissolve  President Grant issued a suspension of Habeas Corpus  and sent Federal troops into 9 South Carolina counties  The Klansmen were arrested and prosecuted in Federal court  More African Americans served on juries in Federal court than were selected for local or state juries  so they had a chance to participate in the process  55  56  In the crackdown  hundreds of Klan members were fined or imprisoned  The Klan declines and is superseded by other groups Although Forrest boasted that the Klan was a nationwide organization of 550 000 men and that he could muster 40 000 Klansmen within five days  notice  as a secret or  invisible  group  it had no membership rosters  no chapters  and no local officers  It was difficult for observers to judge its actual membership  It had created a sensation by the dramatic nature of its masked forays and because of its many murders  In 1870 a federal grand jury determined that the Klan was a  terrorist organization   57  It issued hundreds of indictments for crimes of violence and terrorism  Klan members were prosecuted  and many fled from areas that were under federal government jurisdiction  particularly in South Carolina  58  Many people not formally inducted into the Klan had used the Klan s costume for anonymity  to hide their identities when carrying out acts of violence  Forrest ordered the Klan to disband in 1869  stating that it was  being perverted from its original honorable and patriotic purposes  becoming injurious instead of subservient to the public peace   59  Historian Stanley Horn writes  generally speaking  the Klan s end was more in the form of spotty  slow  and gradual disintegration than a formal and decisive disbandment   60  A reporter in Georgia wrote in January 1870   A true statement of the case is not that the Ku Klux are an organized band of licensed criminals  but that men who commit crimes call themselves Ku Klux   61  Gov  William Holden of North Carolina  While people used the Klan as a mask for nonpolitical crimes  state and local governments seldom acted against them  African Americans were kept off juries  In lynching cases  all white juries almost never indicted Ku Klux Klan members  When there was a rare indictment  juries were unlikely to vote for a conviction  In part  jury members feared reprisals from local Klansmen  Others may have agreed with lynching as a way of keeping dominance over black men  In many states  officials were reluctant to use black militia against the Klan out of fear that racial tensions would be raised  56  When Republican Governor of North Carolina William Woods Holden called out the militia against the Klan in 1870  it added to his unpopularity  Combined with violence and fraud at the polls  the Republicans lost their majority in the state legislature  Disaffection with Holden s actions led to white Democratic legislators  impeaching Holden and removing him from office  but their reasons were numerous  62  The Klan was destroyed in South Carolina 63  and decimated throughout the rest of the South  where it had already been in decline  Attorney General Amos Tappan Ackerman led the prosecutions  64  In some areas  other local paramilitary organizations such as the White League  Red Shirts  saber clubs  and rifle clubs continued to intimidate and murder black voters  65  In 1874  organized white paramilitary groups were formed in the Deep South to replace the faltering Klan  the White League in Louisiana and the Red Shirts in Mississippi  North and South Carolina  They campaigned openly to turn Republicans out of office  intimidated and killed black voters  tried to disrupt organizing and suppressed black voting  They were out in force during the campaigns and elections of 1874 and 1876  contributing to the conservative Democrats regaining power in 1876  against a background of electoral violence  Shortly after  in United States v  Cruikshank  1875   the Supreme Court ruled that the Force Act of 1870 did not give the Federal government power to regulate private actions  but only those by state governments  The result was that as the century went on  African Americans were at the mercy of hostile state governments that refused to intervene against private violence and paramilitary groups  Whereas the number of indictments across the South was large  the number of cases leading to prosecution and sentencing was relatively small  The overloaded federal courts were not able to meet the demands of trying such a tremendous number of cases  a situation that led to selective pardoning  By late 1873 and 1874  most of the charges against Klansmen were dropped although new cases continued to be prosecuted for several more years  Most of those sentenced had either served their terms or had been pardoned by 1875  The Supreme Court of the United States eviscerated the Ku Klux Act in 1876 by ruling that the federal government could no longer prosecute individuals although states would be forced to comply with federal civil rights provisions  Republicans passed a second civil rights act  the Civil Rights Act of 1875  to grant equal access to public facilities and other housing accommodations regardless of race  Ironically  the Klan during this period served to further Northern reconstruction efforts  as Ku Klux violence provided the political climate needed to pass civil rights protections for blacks  Although the Ku Klux Act of 1871 dismantled the first Klan  Southern whites formed other  similar groups that kept blacks away from the polls through intimidation and physical violence  Reconstruction ended with the election of President Rutherford B  Hayes  who suspended the federal military occupation of the South  yet blacks still found themselves without the basic civil liberties that Congressional Republicans had sought to secure  66  In 1882  the Supreme Court ruled in United States v  Harris that the Klan Act was partially unconstitutional  It ruled that Congress s power under the Fourteenth Amendment did not extend to the right to regulate against private conspiracies  67  Klan costumes  also called  regalia   disappeared by the early 1870s  Wade 1987  p  109   The fact that the Klan did not exist for decades was shown when Simmons s 1915 recreation of the Klan attracted only two aging  former Reconstruction Klansmen   All other members were new  68  By 1872  the Klan was broken as an organization  69  Nonetheless  the goals that the Klan had failed to achieve itself  such as suppressing suffrage for Southern blacks and driving a wedge between poor whites and blacks  were largely accomplished by the 1890s by militant Southern whites  Lynchings of African Americans  far from being ended by the Klan s disintegration  instead peaked in 1892 with 161 deaths  70  The second Klan  1915 1944 Refounding in 1915 Three events in 1915 acted as catalysts to the revival of the Klan  The film The Birth of a Nation was released  mythologizing and glorifying the first Klan  Jewish businessman Leo Frank was lynched near Atlanta after the Georgia governor commuted his death sentence to life in prison  Frank had been convicted in 1913 and sentenced to death for the rape and murder of a young white factory worker named Mary Phagan  in a trial marked by intimidation of the jury and media frenzy  His legal appeals had been exhausted  The second Ku Klux Klan was founded by William J  Simmons at Stone Mountain  outside Atlanta  It added to the original anti black ideology with a new anti immigrant  anti Catholic  prohibitionist and antisemitic agenda  Most of the founders were from an Atlanta area organization calling itself the Knights of Mary Phagan  which had organized around Leo Frank s trial  The new organization emulated the fictionalized version of the Klan presented in The Birth of a Nation  The Birth of a Nation An illustration from The Clansman   Take dat f um yo equal   Movie poster for The Birth of a Nation  It has been widely noted for reviving the Ku Klux Klan  William J  Simmons founded the second Ku Klux Klan in 1915 Branford Clarke illustration in The Ku Klux Klan In Prophecy by Bishop Alma White published by the Pillar of Fire Church in 1925 at Zarephath  NJ Director D  W  Griffith s The Birth of a Nation glorified the original Klan  His film was based on the book and play The Clansman and the book The Leopard s Spots  both by Thomas Dixon  Jr  Dixon said his purpose was  to revolutionize northern sentiment by a presentation of history that would transform every man in my audience into a good Democrat   The film created a nationwide Klan craze  At the official premier in Atlanta  members of the Klan rode up and down the street in front of the theater  71  Much of the modern Klan s iconography  including the standardized white costume and the lighted cross  are derived from the film  Its imagery was based on Dixon s romanticized concept of old England and Scotland  as portrayed in the novels and poetry of Sir Walter Scott  The film s influence and popularity were enhanced by a widely reported endorsement by historian and U S  President Woodrow Wilson  The Birth of a Nation included extensive quotations from Woodrow Wilson s History of the American People  as if to give it a stronger basis  After seeing the film in a special White House screening  Wilson allegedly said   It is like writing history with lightning  and my only regret is that it is all so terribly true   72  Wilson s remarks immediately became controversial  Wilson tried to remain aloof  but finally  on April 30  he issued a non denial denial  73  Wilson s aide  Joseph Tumulty said   the President was entirely unaware of the nature of the play before it was presented and at no time has expressed his approbation of it   74  The new Klan was inaugurated in 1915 at a meeting led by William J  Simmons on top of Stone Mountain  A few aging members of the original Klan attended  along with members of the self named Knights of Mary Phagan  Simmons stated that he had been inspired by the original Klan s Prescripts  written in 1867 by Confederate veteran George Gordon in an attempt to create a national organization  These were never adopted by the Klan  however  75  The Prescript stated the Klan s purposes in idealistic terms  hiding the fact that its members committed acts of vigilante violence and murder from behind masks  Social factors Photograph on Page 4  February 1923 edition of The Good Citizen From Klansmen  Guardians of Liberty 1926 ill  by Rev  Branford Clarke  The End  Referring to the end of Catholic influence in the US  Klansmen  Guardians of Liberty 1926 The Second Klan saw threats from every direction  A religious tone was apparent in all of its activities  indeed   two thirds of the national Klan lecturers were Protestant ministers   says historian Brian R  Farmer  76  Much of the Klan s energy went to guarding the home  in its view  says historian Kathleen Blee  to protect  the interests of white womanhood   77  The second Klan arose during the nadir of American race relations  in response to urbanization and industrialization  Massive immigration of Catholics and Jews from eastern and southern Europe led to fears among Protestants  The Great Migration of African Americans to the North stoked racism by whites in Northern industrial cities  thus the second Klan would achieve its greatest political power not in any Southern state  but in Indiana  The migration of African Americans and whites from rural areas to Southern cities further increased tensions  The Klan grew most rapidly in urbanizing cities which had high growth rates between 1910 and 1930  such as Detroit  Memphis  Dayton  Atlanta  Dallas  and Houston  In Michigan  more than half of the members lived in Detroit and were concerned about urban issues  limited housing  rapid social change  competition for jobs  78 Stanley Horn  a Southern historian sympathetic to the first Klan  was careful in an oral interview to distinguish it from the later  spurious Ku Klux organization which was in ill repute and  of course  had no connection whatsoever with the Klan of Reconstruction days   79  In an era without Social Security or widely available life insurance  it was common for men to join fraternal organizations such as the Elks or the Woodmen of the World to provide for their families in case they died or were unable to work  The founder of the new Klan  William J  Simmons  was a member of twelve different fraternal organizations  He recruited for the Klan with his chest covered with fraternal badges  and consciously modeled the Klan after those organizations  80  Klan organizers  called  Kleagles   signed up hundreds of new members  who paid initiation fees and bought KKK costumes  The organizer kept half the money and sent the rest to state or national officials  When the organizer was done with an area  he organized a huge rally  often with burning crosses and perhaps presented a Bible to a local Protestant minister  He then left town with the money  The local units operated like many fraternal organizations and occasionally brought in speakers  The Klan s growth was also affected by mobilization for World War I and postwar tensions  especially in the cities where strangers came up against each other more often  Southern whites resented the arming of black soldiers  Black veterans did not want to go back to second class status in the United States  Some were lynched  still in uniform  upon returning from overseas service  81  Activities Simmons initially met with little success in either recruiting members or in raising money  and the Klan remained a small operation in the Atlanta area until 1920  when he handed its day to day activities over to two professional publicists  Elizabeth Tyler and Edward Young Clarke  82  The Klan now expanded exponentially  reaching a mass national base by 1925  The remodeled Klan downplayed the old issues left over from Reconstruction  and focused on anti Jewish  anti Catholic  anti Communist and anti immigrant appeals  It now sold itself as a nativist and strenuously patriotic organization  and it emphasized its support for vigorous enforcement of prohibition laws  Most of its members lived in the North and West  Prohibition Historians agree that the Klan s resurgence in the 1920s was aided by the national debate over prohibition  83  Thus Prendergast contends that the KKK s  support for Prohibition represented the single most important bond between Klansmen throughout the nation   84  The Klan opposed bootleggers  sometimes with violence  In 1922  two hundred Klan members set fire to saloons in Union County  Arkansas  The national Klan office was finally established in Dallas  Texas  but Little Rock  Arkansas was the home of the Women of the Ku Klux Klan  The first head of this auxiliary was a former president of the Arkansas WCTU  85  verification needed  Membership in the Klan and in other prohibition groups overlapped  and they often coordinated activities  86  Labor and anti unionism In southern cities such as Birmingham  Alabama  Klan members kept control of access to the better paying industrial jobs but opposed unions  During the 1930s and 1940s  Klan leaders urged members to disrupt the Congress of Industrial Organizations  CIO   which advocated industrial unions and was open to African American members  With access to dynamite and using the skills from their jobs in mining and steel  in the late 1940s some Klan members in Birmingham began to perpetrate bombings in order to intimidate upwardly mobile blacks who moved into middle class neighborhoods   By mid 1949  there were so many charred house carcasses that the area  College Hills  was informally named Dynamite Hill   87  Independent Klan groups remained active in Birmingham and were deeply engaged in violent opposition to the Civil Rights Movement  87  Urbanization Stone Mountain  site of the founding of the second Klan in 1915 A significant characteristic of the second Klan was that it was an organization based in urban areas  reflecting the major shifts of population to cities in both the North and the South  In Michigan  for instance  40 000 members lived in Detroit  where they made up more than half of the state s membership  Most Klansmen were lower  to middle class whites who were trying to protect their jobs and housing from the waves of newcomers to the industrial cities  immigrants from southern and eastern Europe  who tended to be Catholic and Jewish in numbers higher than earlier groups of immigrants  and black and white migrants from the South  As new populations poured into cities  rapidly changing neighborhoods created social tensions  Because of the rapid pace of population growth in industrializing cities such as Detroit and Chicago  the Klan grew rapidly in the U S  Midwest  The Klan also grew in booming Southern cities such as Dallas and Houston  88  In the medium size industrial city of Worcester  Massachusetts in the 1920s  the Klan ascended to power quickly but diminished as a result of opposition from the Catholic Church  There was no violence and the local newspaper ridiculed Klansmen as  night shirt knights   Half of the members were Swedish American  including some first generation immigrants  The ethnic and religious conflicts between Worcester residents is discussed  Swedish Protestants fought against Irish Catholics for political and ideological control of the city  89  For some states  historians have obtained membership rosters of some local units and matched the names against city directory and local records to create statistical profiles of the membership  Big city newspapers were often hostile and ridiculed Klansmen as ignorant farmers  Detailed analysis from Indiana showed the rural stereotype was false for that state  Indiana s Klansmen represented a wide cross section of society  they were not disproportionately urban or rural  nor were they significantly more or less likely than other members of society to be from the working class  middle class  or professional ranks  Klansmen were Protestants  of course  but they cannot be described exclusively or even predominantly as fundamentalists  In reality  their religious affiliations mirrored the whole of white Protestant society  including those who did not belong to any church  90  The Klan attracted people but most of them did not remain in the organization for long  Membership in the Klan turned over rapidly as people found out that it was not the group they wanted  Millions joined  and at its peak in the 1920s  the organization included about 15  of the nation s eligible population  The lessening of social tensions contributed to the Klan s decline  The burning cross Cross burning is said to have been introduced by William J  Simmons  the founder of the second Klan in 1915  The second Klan adopted a burning Latin cross as its symbol  No such crosses had been used by the first Klan  but the burning cross was used as a symbol of intimidation by the second Klan  91  The burning of the cross was also used by the second Klan as a symbol of Christian fellowship  and its lighting during meetings was steeped in Christian prayer  the singing of hymns  and other overtly religious symbolism  11  The practice of cross burning had been loosely based on ancient Scottish clans  burning a St  Andrew s cross  an X shaped cross  as a beacon to muster forces for war  In The Clansman  see above   Dixon had falsely claimed that the first Klan had used fiery crosses when rallying to fight against Reconstruction  Griffith brought this image to the screen in The Birth of a Nation  he portrayed the burning cross as an upright Latin cross rather than the St  Andrew s cross  Simmons adopted the symbol wholesale from the movie  prominently displaying it at the 1915 Stone Mountain meeting  The symbol has been associated with the Klan ever since  92  Education In 1921  in an attempt to gain a foothold in education  the Klan bought Lanier University  a struggling Baptist university in Atlanta  Nathan Bedford Forrest  grandson of the confederate general by the same name  was appointed business manager  and the school would teach  pure  100 percent Americanism   Enrollment was dismal and the school closed after its first year of Klan ownership  93  Political role Sheet music to  We Are All Loyal Klansmen   1923 The Good Citizen July 1926 Published by Pillar of Fire Church Branford Clarke illustration in Heroes of the Fiery Cross  1928 The Klan had numerous members in every part of the U S  At its peak  claimed Klan membership exceeded four million and comprised 20  of the adult white male population in many broad geographic regions  and 40  in some areas  94  The Klan also moved north into Canada  especially Saskatchewan  where it opposed Catholics  95  The Klan issue played a significant role at the bitterly divisive 1924 Democratic National Convention in New York City  The leading candidates were Protestant William Gibbs McAdoo  with a base in areas where the Klan was strong  and Catholic New York Governor Al Smith  with a base in the large cities  After weeks of stalemate  both candidates withdrew in favor of a compromise  Anti Klan delegates proposed a resolution indirectly attacking the Klan  it was narrowly defeated  96  97  In some states  such as Alabama and California  the KKK worked for political reform  In 1924  the Klan became active in local politics in Anaheim  California  The city had been controlled by an entrenched commercial civic elite that was mostly German American  The elite gave little support to the prohibition laws the mayor  for example  had been a saloon keeper  The Klan  led by the minister of the First Christian Church  represented a rising group of politically oriented non German citizens who had been shut out of influence and who denounced the elite as corrupt  undemocratic and self serving  Cocoltchos says the Klansmen sought to create a model orderly community  There were about 1200 Klan members in orange County  and Cocoltchos tracked them through local records  comparing them to 300 prominent anti Klan activists  The economic and occupational profile of the pro and anti Klan groups shows the two were similar and about equally prosperous  Cocoltchos finds no evidence of status anxiety  The Klansmen were all Protestants  as were most of the antis  but the antis also enlisted many Catholic Germans  The Klansmen had a much higher rate of voting and joining nonpartisan civic groups  such as the Chamber of Commerce  than the others before they joined the Klan  suggesting to Cocoltchos it was a high sense of civic activism that led to joining the KKK in the first place  The Klan easily won the hotly contested local election in Anaheim in April 1924  They systematically fired Catholic city employees and replaced them with Klansmen  The new city council tried to strictly enforce prohibition  and the Klan held large rallies and initiation ceremonies over the summer  The opposition organized  bribed a Klansman for the secret membership list  exposed the Klansmen running in the primaries and defeated most of them  The antis stepped up the campaign in 1925 and succeeded in a hotly contested election in voting to recall the Klansmen who had been elected in April 1924  The Klan in Anaheim quickly collapsed  its newspaper closed after losing a libel suit  and the minister who led the local Klavern moved to Kansas  98  In Alabama the Klansmen were among the foremost advocates of better public schools  effective prohibition enforcement  expanded road construction  and other political measures which benefited lower class white people  By 1925  the Klan was a political force in the state  as leaders such as J  Thomas Heflin  David Bibb Graves  and Hugo Black manipulated the KKK membership to try to build political power against the Black Belt planters  who had long dominated the state  99  Black was elected US senator in 1926  President Franklin D  Roosevelt appointed Black to the Supreme Court not knowing he had been active in the Klan in the 1920s  In 1926  with Klan support  Bibb Graves won the Alabama governor s office  He was a former Klan chapter head  He pushed for increased education funding  better public health  new highway construction  and pro labor legislation  Because the Alabama state legislature refused to redistrict until 1972  however  even the Klan was unable to break the planters  and rural areas  hold on legislative power  Its predecessor had been an exclusively partisan Democratic organization in the South  The second Klan grew in the Midwest  where for a time  its members were courted by both Republicans and Democrats  The KKK state organizations endorsed candidates from either party that supported its goals  Prohibition in particular helped the Klan and some Republicans to make common cause in the Midwest  In the South  however  the southern Klan remained Democratic  closely allied with Democratic police  sheriffs  and other functionaries of local government  With continuing disfranchisement of most African Americans and many poor whites  the only political activity took place within the Democratic Party  Resistance and decline The Ku Klux Klan rose to prominence in Indiana politics and society after World War I  It was made up of American born  white Protestants of many income and social levels  Nationally  in the 1920s  Indiana had the most powerful Ku Klux Klan  Though it counted a high number of members statewide  over 30  of its white male citizens 100    its importance peaked with the 1924 election of Edward Jackson for governor  A short time later  the scandal surrounding the murder trial of D C  Stephenson destroyed the image of the Ku Klux Klan as upholders of law and order  By 1926 the Ku Klux Klan was  crippled and discredited   101  D  C  Stephenson  Grand Dragon of the Indiana Klan  His conviction for murdering a young white schoolteacher in 1925 devastated the Indiana Klan  D  C  Stephenson was the Grand Dragon of Indiana and 22 northern states  He led the states under his control to separate from the national KKK organization in 1923  In his 1925 trial  he was convicted for second degree murder for his part in the rape and subsequent death 102  of Madge Oberholtzer  After Stephenson s conviction in a sensational trial  the Klan declined dramatically in Indiana  Historian Leonard Moore concluded that a failure in leadership caused the Klan s collapse  Stephenson and the other salesmen and office seekers who maneuvered for control of Indiana s Invisible Empire lacked both the ability and the desire to use the political system to carry out the Klan s stated goals  They were uninterested in  or perhaps even unaware of  grass roots concerns within the movement  For them  the Klan had been nothing more than a means for gaining wealth and power  These marginal men had risen to the top of the hooded order because  until it became a political force  the Klan had never required strong  dedicated leadership  More established and experienced politicians who endorsed the Klan  or who pursued some of the interests of their Klan constituents  also accomplished little  Factionalism created one barrier  but many politicians had supported the Klan simply out of expedience  When charges of crime and corruption began to taint the movement  those concerned about their political futures had even less reason to work on the Klan s behalf  103  Many groups and leaders  including prominent Protestant ministers such as Reinhold Niebuhr in Detroit  spoke out against the Klan  In response to blunt attacks against Jewish Americans and the Klan s campaign to outlaw private schools  the Jewish Anti Defamation League was formed after the lynching of Leo Frank  When one civic group began to publish Klan membership lists  the number of members quickly declined  The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People carried on public education campaigns in order to inform people about Klan activities and lobbied against Klan abuses in Congress  After its peak in 1925  Klan membership in most areas of the Midwest began to decline rapidly  88  In Alabama  KKK vigilantes  thinking that they had governmental protection  launched a wave of physical terror in 1927  They targeted both blacks and whites for violation of racial norms and for perceived moral lapses  104  This led however to a large backlash beginning in the media  Grover C  Hall  Sr   editor of the Montgomery Advertiser  began publishing a series of editorials and articles that attacked the Klan for its  racial and religious intolerance   Hall won a Pulitzer Prize for his crusade  105  Other newspapers kept up a steady  loud attack on the Klan  referring to the organization as violent and  un American   Sheriffs cracked down  In the 1928 presidential election  the state voted for the Democratic candidate Al Smith  although he was Catholic  Klan membership in Alabama dropped to less than 6 000 by 1930  Small independent units continued to be active in Birmingham  where in the late 1940s  members launched a reign of terror by bombing the homes of upwardly mobile African Americans  Activism by such independent KKK groups increased as a reaction against the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s  Imperial Wizard Hiram Wesley Evans sold the organization in 1939 to James Colescott  an Indiana veterinarian  and Samuel Green  an Atlanta obstetrician  They were unable to staunch the declining membership  In 1944  the IRS filed a lien for  685 000 in back taxes against the Klan  and Colescott was forced to dissolve the organization in 1944  Local Klan groups closed over the following years  106  Ku Klux Klan members march down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington  D C  in 1928 Due in part to the Klan terror directed at them  five million blacks left the South for northern  midwestern and western cities from 1940 to 1970  After World War II  folklorist and author Stetson Kennedy infiltrated the Klan and provided information to media and law enforcement agencies  He also provided secret code words to the writers of the Superman radio program  resulting in episodes in which Superman took on the KKK  Kennedy s intention to strip away the Klan s mystique and trivialize the Klan s rituals and code words may have contributed to the decline in Klan recruiting and membership  107  In the 1950s  Kennedy wrote a bestselling book about his experiences  which further damaged the Klan  108  The following table shows the change in the Klan s estimated membership over time  109   The years given in the table represent approximate time periods   Year Membership 1920 4 000 000 110  1924 6 000 000 1930 30 000 1980 5 000 2008 6 000 Later Klans  1950 through 1960s Soviet propaganda poster  Freedom  American style  1950  by Nikolay Dolgorukov and Boris Efimov   showing the KKK s lynchings of blacks  The name  Ku Klux Klan  began to be used by several independent groups  Beginning in the 1950s  for instance  individual Klan groups in Birmingham  Alabama  began to resist social change and blacks  improving their lives by bombing houses in transitional neighborhoods  There were so many bombings in Birmingham of blacks  homes by Klan groups in the 1950s that the city s nickname was  Bombingham   22  During the tenure of Bull Connor as police commissioner in the city  Klan groups were closely allied with the police and operated with impunity  When the Freedom Riders arrived in Birmingham  Connor gave Klan members fifteen minutes to attack the riders before sending in the police to quell the attack  22  When local and state authorities failed to protect the Freedom Riders and activists  the federal government established effective intervention  In states such as Alabama and Mississippi  Klan members forged alliances with governors  administrations  22  In Birmingham and elsewhere  the KKK groups bombed the houses of civil rights activists  In some cases they used physical violence  intimidation and assassination directly against individuals  Many murders went unreported and were not prosecuted by local and state authorities  Continuing disfranchisement of blacks across the South meant that most could not serve on juries  which were all white  According to a report from the Southern Regional Council in Atlanta  the homes of 40 black Southern families were bombed during 1951 and 1952  Some of the bombing victims were social activists whose work exposed them to danger  but most were either people who refused to bow to racist convention or were innocent bystanders  unsuspecting victims of random violence  111  Among the more notorious murders by Klan members  The 1951 Christmas Eve bombing of the home of National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  NAACP  activists Harry and Harriette Moore in Mims  Florida  resulting in their deaths  112  The 1957 murder of Willie Edwards  Jr  Klansmen forced Edwards to jump to his death from a bridge into the Alabama River  113  The 1963 assassination of NAACP organizer Medgar Evers in Mississippi  In 1994  former Ku Klux Klansman Byron De La Beckwith was convicted  The 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham  Alabama  which killed four African American girls  The perpetrators were Klan members Robert Chambliss  convicted in 1977  Thomas Blanton and Bobby Frank Cherry  convicted in 2001 and 2002  The fourth suspect  Herman Cash  died before he was indicted  The 1964 murders of three civil rights workers  Chaney  Goodman and Schwerner  in Mississippi  In June 2005  Klan member Edgar Ray Killen was convicted of manslaughter  114  The 1964 murder of two black teenagers  Henry Hezekiah Dee and Charles Eddie Moore in Mississippi  In August 2007  based on the confession of Klansman Charles Marcus Edwards  James Ford Seale  a reputed Ku Klux Klansman  was convicted  Seale was sentenced to serve three life sentences  Seale was a former Mississippi policeman and sheriff s deputy  115  The 1965 Alabama murder of Viola Liuzzo  She was a Southern raised Detroit mother of five who was visiting the state in order to attend a civil rights march  At the time of her murder Liuzzo was transporting Civil Rights Marchers  The 1966 firebombing death of NAACP leader Vernon Dahmer Sr   58  in Mississippi  In 1998 former Ku Klux Klan wizard Sam Bowers was convicted of his murder and sentenced to life  Two other Klan members were indicted with Bowers  but one died before trial  and the other s indictment was dismissed  There was also resistance to the Klan  In 1953  newspaper publisher W  Horace Carter received a Pulitzer prize for reporting on the activities of the Klan  In a 1958 North Carolina incident  the Klan burned crosses at the homes of two Lumbee Native Americans who had associated with white people  and they threatened to return with more men  When the KKK held a nighttime rally nearby  they were quickly surrounded by hundreds of armed Lumbees  Gunfire was exchanged  and the Klan was routed at what became known as the Battle of Hayes Pond  116  While the Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI  had paid informants in the Klan  for instance in Birmingham in the early 1960s  its relations with local law enforcement agencies and the Klan were often ambiguous  The head of the FBI  J  Edgar Hoover  appeared more concerned about Communist links to civil rights activists than about controlling Klan excesses against citizens  In 1964  the FBI s COINTELPRO program began attempts to infiltrate and disrupt civil rights groups  22  As 20th century Supreme Court rulings extended federal enforcement of citizens  civil rights  the government revived the Force Act and Klan Act from Reconstruction days  Federal prosecutors used these laws as the basis for investigations and indictments in the 1964 murders of Chaney  Goodman and Schwerner  117  and the 1965 murder of Viola Liuzzo  118  They were also the basis for prosecution in 1991 in Bray v  Alexandria Women s Health Clinic  Contemporary Klan  1970s present Violence at a Klan march in Mobile  Alabama  1977 Once African Americans secured federal legislation to protect civil and voting rights  the KKK shifted its focus to opposing court ordered busing to desegregate schools  affirmative action and more open immigration  In 1971  KKK members used bombs to destroy 10 school buses in Pontiac  Michigan  Altercation with Communist Workers Party Main article  Greensboro massacre On November 3  1979  five protesters were killed by KKK and American Nazi Party members in the Greensboro massacre in Greensboro  North Carolina  119  This incident was the culmination of attempts by the Communist Workers Party to organize industrial workers  predominantly black  in the area  120  Jerry Thompson infiltration Jerry Thompson  a newspaper reporter who infiltrated the KKK in 1979  reported that the FBI s COINTELPRO efforts were highly successful  Rival KKK factions accused each other s leaders of being FBI informants  Bill Wilkinson of the Invisible Empire  Knights of the Ku Klux Klan  was revealed to have been working for the FBI  121  Thompson  the journalist who claimed he had infiltrated the Klan  related that KKK leaders who appeared indifferent to the threat of arrest showed great concern about a series of civil lawsuits filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center for damages of millions of dollars  These were filed after KKK members shot into a group of African Americans  Klansmen curtailed activities to conserve money for defense against the lawsuits  The KKK also used lawsuits as tools  they filed a libel suit to prevent publication of a paperback edition of Thompson s book  Tennessee shooting In 1980  three KKK members shot four elderly black women  Viola Ellison  Lela Evans  Opal Jackson and Katherine Johnson  in Chattanooga  Tennessee  following a KKK initiation rally  A fifth woman  Fannie Crumsey  was injured by flying glass in the incident  Attempted murder charges were filed against the three KKK members  two of whom Bill Church and Larry Payne were acquitted by an all white jury  and the other of whom Marshall Thrash was sentenced by the same jury to nine months on lesser charges  He was released after three months  122  123  124  In 1982  a jury awarded the five women  535 000 in a civil rights trial  125  Michael Donald lynching After Michael Donald was lynched in 1981 in Alabama  the FBI investigated his death and two local KKK members were convicted of having a role  including Henry Francis Hays  who was sentenced to death  With the support of attorneys Morris Dees and Joseph J  Levin of the Southern Poverty Law Center  SPLC   Donald s mother  Beulah Mae Donald  sued the KKK in civil court in Alabama  Her lawsuit against the United Klans of America was tried in February 1987  The all white jury found the Klan responsible for the lynching of Donald and ordered the Klan to pay US 7 million  To pay the judgment  the KKK turned over all of its assets  including its national headquarters building in Tuscaloosa  126  After exhausting the appeals process  Hays was executed for Donald s death in Alabama on June 6  1997  It was the first time since 1913 that a white man had been executed in Alabama for a crime against an African American  127  Neo Nazi alliances and Stormfront Main article  Stormfront  website  In 1995  Don Black and Chlo  Hardin  former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke s ex wife  began a small bulletin board system  BBS  called Stormfront  Today  Stormfront has become a prominent online forum for white nationalism  Neo Nazism  hate speech  racism  and antisemitism  128  129  130  Duke has an account on Stormfront which he uses to post articles from his own website  as well as polling forum members for opinions and questions  in particular during his internet broadcasts  Duke has worked with Don Black on numerous projects including Operation Red Dog in 1980  131  132  Modern statistics The modern KKK is not one organization  rather it is composed of small independent chapters across the U S  133  The formation of independent chapters has made KKK groups more difficult to infiltrate  and researchers find it hard to estimate their numbers  Estimates are that about two thirds of KKK members are concentrated in the Southern United States  with another third situated primarily in the lower Midwest  134  135  136  KKK members have stepped up recruitment in recent years  but the organization grows slowly  with membership estimated at 5 000 8 000 across 179 chapters  These recent membership campaigns have been based on issues such as people s anxieties about illegal immigration  urban crime and same sex marriage  137  Many KKK groups have formed strong alliances with other white supremacist groups  such as neo Nazis  Some KKK groups have become increasingly  Nazified   adopting the look and emblems of white power skinheads  138  On November 14  2008  an all white jury of seven men and seven women awarded  1 5 million in compensatory damages and  1 million in punitive damages to plaintiff Jordan Gruver  represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center against the Imperial Klans of America  139  The ruling found that five IKA members had savagely beaten Gruver  then 16 years old  at a Kentucky county fair in July 2006  140  The American Civil Liberties Union  ACLU  has provided legal support to various factions of the KKK in defense of their First Amendment rights to hold public rallies  parades  and marches  as well as their right to field political candidates  141  Current Klan splinter divisions have grown substantially since the 2008 election of U S  President Barack Obama  the first African American to hold the office  142  143  the Klan has expanded its recruitment efforts to white supremacists at the international level  144  Current membership estimates by the ADL hold at a national estimate of five thousand  136  Ex Grand Wizard David Duke has claimed that thousands of Tea Party movement activists have urged him to run for president in 2012 145  and he is seriously considering entering the Republican Party primaries  146  Duke has also released a video detailing his platform  147  In the video  he pledges that as president he would stop all immigration to the U S   including legal immigration  and says that he  will not let Israel or any nation dictate our foreign policy   148  He has also claimed that he would be  willing to risk life and limb  endure the barbs of the media  to mount  the most honest campaign for president since the time of our Founding Fathers   149  However  Duke is legally disqualified from running for public office as part of his 2002 guilty plea for tax evasion  150  Current Klan organizations A list is maintained by the Anti Defamation League  ADL   151  Bayou Knights of the Ku Klux Klan  prevalent in Texas  Oklahoma  Arkansas  Louisiana and other areas of the Southeastern U S  Church of the American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan 134  Imperial Klans of America 152  Knights of the White Camelia 153  Knights of the Ku Klux Klan  headed by national director and self claimed pastor Thom Robb  and based in Zinc  Arkansas  154  It claims to be the biggest Klan organization in America today  Other countries Aside from Canada  there have been various attempts to organise KKK chapters outside of the United States  In Australia in the late 1990s  former One Nation founding member Peter Coleman established branches throughout the country  155  156  and in recent years the KKK has attempted to infiltrate other political parties such as Australia First  157  Recruitment activity has also been reported in Britain  158  159  Vocabulary Membership in the Klan is secret  Like many fraternal organizations  the Klan has signs which members can use to recognize one another  A member may use the acronym AYAK  Are you a Klansman   in conversation to surreptitiously identify himself to another potential member  The response AKIA  A Klansman I am  completes the greeting  160  Throughout its varied history  the Klan has coined many words 161  beginning with  Kl  including  Klabee  treasurers Klavern  local organization Imperial Kleagle  recruiter Klecktoken  initiation fee Kligrapp  secretary Klonvocation  gathering Kloran  ritual book Kloreroe  delegate Imperial Kludd  chaplain All of the above terminology was created by William Simmons  as part of his 1915 revival of the Klan  162  The Reconstruction era Klan used different titles  the only titles to carry over were  Wizard  for the overall leader of the Klan and  Night Hawk  for the official in charge of security  The Imperial Kludd was the chaplain of the Imperial Klonvokation and he performed  such other duties as may be required by the Imperial Wizard   The Imperial Kaliff was the second highest position after the Imperial Wizard  163  See also Gangs
