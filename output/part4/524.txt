American Revolution From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search This article is about political and social developments  and the origins and aftermath of the war  For military actions  see American Revolutionary War  For other uses  see American Revolution  disambiguation   In this article  inhabitants of the Thirteen Colonies of British America that supported the American Revolution are primarily referred to as  Americans   with occasional references to  Patriots    Whigs    Rebels  or  Revolutionaries   Colonists who supported the British in opposing the Revolution are usually referred to as  Loyalists  or  Tories   The geographical area of the thirteen colonies is often referred to simply as  America   John Trumbull s Declaration of Independence  showing the five man committee in charge of drafting the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776 as it presents its work to the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia The American Revolution was the political upheaval during the last half of the 18th century in which thirteen colonies in North America joined together to break free from the British Empire  combining to become the United States of America  They first rejected the authority of the Parliament of Great Britain to govern them from overseas without representation  and then expelled all royal officials  By 1774  each colony had established a Provincial Congress  or an equivalent governmental institution  to govern itself  but still within the empire  The British responded by sending combat troops to re impose direct rule  Through representatives sent in 1775 to the Second Continental Congress  the states joined together at first to defend their respective self governance and manage the armed conflict against the British known as the American Revolutionary War  1775 83  also American War of Independence   Ultimately  the states collectively determined that the British monarchy  by acts of tyranny  could no longer legitimately claim their allegiance  They then severed ties with the British Empire in July 1776  when the Congress issued the United States Declaration of Independence  rejecting the monarchy on behalf of the new sovereign nation separate and external to the British Empire  The war ended with effective American victory in October 1781  followed by formal British abandonment of any claims to the United States with the Treaty of Paris in 1783  The American Revolution was the result of a series of social  political  and intellectual transformations in early American society and government  collectively referred to as the American Enlightenment  Americans rejected the oligarchies common in aristocratic Europe at the time  championing instead the development of republicanism based on the Enlightenment understanding of liberalism  Among the significant results of the revolution was the creation of a democratically elected representative government responsible to the will of the people  However  sharp political debates erupted over the appropriate level of democracy desirable in the new government  with a number of Founders fearing mob rule  Many fundamental issues of national governance were settled with the ratification of the United States Constitution in 1788  which replaced the relatively weaker first attempt at a national government adopted in 1781  the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union  In contrast to the loose confederation  the Constitution established a strong federated government  The United States Bill of Rights  1791   comprising the first 10 constitutional amendments  quickly followed  It guaranteed many  natural rights  that were influential in justifying the revolution  and attempted to balance a strong national government with relatively broad personal liberties  The American shift to liberal republicanism  and the gradually increasing democracy  caused an upheaval of traditional social hierarchy and gave birth to the ethic that has formed a core of political values in the United States  1  2  Contents 1 Origins 1 1 Summary 1 2 Ideology behind the Revolution 1 2 1 Locke and natural rights 1 2 2 Republicanism 1 2 2

of ideas and events that  combined  led to a political and social separation of colonial possessions from the home nation and a coalescing of those former individual colonies into an independent nation  Summary The American revolutionary era began in 1763  after a series of victories by British forces at the conclusion of the French and Indian War that ended the French military threat to British North American colonies  Adopting the policy that the colonies should pay a larger proportion of the costs associated with keeping them in the Empire  Britain imposed a series of direct taxes  later known as the  Stamp Act    followed by other laws intended to demonstrate British authority  all of which proved extremely unpopular in America  Because the colonies lacked elected representation in the governing British Parliament  many colonists considered the laws to be illegitimate and a violation of their rights as Englishmen  In 1772  groups of colonists began to create Committees of Correspondence  which would lead to their own Provincial Congresses in most of the colonies  In the course of two years  the Provincial Congresses or their equivalents rejected the Parliament and effectively replaced the British ruling apparatus in the former colonies  culminating in 1774 with the coordinating First Continental Congress  3  In response to protests in Boston over Parliament s attempts to assert authority  the British sent combat troops  dissolved local governments  and imposed direct rule by Royal officials  Consequently  the Colonies mobilized their militias  and fighting broke out in 1775  First ostensibly loyal to King George III and desiring to govern themselves while remaining in the empire  the repeated pleas by the First Continental Congress for royal intervention on their behalf with Parliament resulted in the declaration by the King that the states were  in rebellion   and the members of Congress were traitors  In 1776  representatives from each of the original 13 states voted unanimously in the Second Continental Congress to adopt a Declaration of Independence  which now rejected the British monarchy in addition to its Parliament  and established the sovereignty of the new nation external to the British Empire  The Declaration established the United States  which was originally governed as a loose confederation through a representative democracy selected by state legislatures  see Second Continental Congress and Congress of the Confederation   Ideology behind the Revolution Main articles  American Enlightenment  Liberalism in the United States  Republicanism in the United States  and Freedom of religion in the United States Further information  A Summary View of the Rights of British America  Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania  and Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms The ideological movement known as the American Enlightenment was a critical precursor to the American Revolution  Chief among the ideas of the American Enlightenment were the concepts of liberalism  democracy  republicanism  and religious tolerance  Collectively  the belief in these concepts by a growing number of American colonists began to foster an intellectual environment which would lead to a new sense of political and social identity  Locke and natural rights In this c  1772 portrait by John Singleton Copley  Adams points at the Massachusetts Charter  which he viewed as a constitution that protected the peoples  rights  4  John Locke s  1632 1704  ideas on liberty greatly influenced the political thinking behind the revolution  John Locke s Two Treatises of Government  published in 1689  was especially influential  The theory of the  social contract  influenced the belief among many of the Founders that among the  natural rights  of man was the right of the people to overthrow their leaders  should those leaders betray the historic rights of Englishmen  5  6  In terms of writing state and national constitutions  the Americans heavily used Montesquieu s analysis of the  balanced  British Constitution  Republicanism A motivating force behind the revolution was the American embrace of a political ideology called  republicanism   which was dominant in the colonies by 1775  The republicanism was inspired by the  country party  in Britain  whose critique of British government emphasized that corruption was a terrible reality in Britain  7  Americans feared the corruption was crossing the Atlantic  the commitment of most Americans to republican values and to their rights  energized the revolution  as Britain was increasingly seen as hopelessly corrupt and hostile to American interests  Britain seemed to threaten the established liberties that Americans enjoyed  8  The greatest threat to liberty was depicted as corruption not just in London but at home as well  The colonists associated it with luxury and  especially  inherited aristocracy  which they condemned  9  The Founding Fathers were strong advocates of republican values  particularly Samuel Adams  Patrick Henry  John Adams  Benjamin Franklin  Thomas Jefferson  Thomas Paine  George Washington  James Madison and Alexander Hamilton  10  which required men to put civic duty ahead of their personal desires  Men had a civic duty to be prepared and willing to fight for the rights and liberties of their countrymen and countrywomen  John Adams  writing to Mercy Otis Warren in 1776  agreed with some classical Greek and Roman thinkers in that  Public Virtue cannot exist without private  and public Virtue is the only Foundation of Republics   He continued   There must be a positive Passion for the public good  the public Interest  Honour  Power  and Glory  established in the Minds of the People  or there can be no Republican Government  nor any real Liberty  And this public Passion must be Superior to all private Passions  Men must be ready  they must pride themselves  and be happy to sacrifice their private Pleasures  Passions  and Interests  nay their private Friendships and dearest connections  when they Stand in Competition with the Rights of society   11  For women   republican motherhood  became the ideal  exemplified by Abigail Adams and Mercy Otis Warren  the first duty of the republican woman was to instill republican values in her children and to avoid luxury and ostentation  Fusing republicanism and liberalism Thomas Paine s pamphlet Common Sense  published in 1776 Thomas Paine s best seller pamphlet Common Sense appeared in January 1776  after the Revolution had started  It was widely distributed and loaned  and often read aloud in taverns  contributing significantly to spreading the ideas of republicanism and liberalism  bolstering enthusiasm for separation from Britain  and encouraging recruitment for the Continental Army  Paine provided a new and widely accepted argument for independence  by advocating a complete break with history  Common Sense is oriented to the future in a way that compels the reader to make an immediate choice  It offered a solution for Americans disgusted and alarmed at the threat of tyranny  12  Impact of Great Awakening Main article  First Great Awakening Dissenting  i e  Protestant  non Church of England  churches of the day were the  school of democracy  13  President John Witherspoon of the College of New Jersey  now Princeton University  wrote widely circulated sermons linking the American Revolution to the teachings of the Hebrew Bible  Throughout the colonies dissenting Protestant congregations  Congregationalist  Baptist  and Presbyterian  preached Revolutionary themes in their sermons  while most Church of England ministers preached loyalty to the King  14  Religious motivation for fighting tyranny reached across socioeconomic lines to encompass rich and poor  men and women  frontiersmen and townsmen  farmers and merchants  13  Historian Bernard Bailyn argues that the evangelism of the era challenged traditional notions of natural hierarchy by teaching that the Bible taught all men are equal  so that the true value of a man lies in his moral behavior  not his class  15  Kidd argues that religious disestablishment  belief in a God as the guarantor of human rights  and shared convictions about sin  virtue  and divine providence worked together to unite rationalists and evangelicals and thus encouraged American defiance of the Empire  Emphasizing intense opposition to sending an Anglican bishop to the colonies  and anger at the pro Catholic Quebec Act of 1774  Kidd argues that they reflected the long term impact of the Great Awakening  in terms of apocalyptic warnings religious egalitarianism  and anti Catholicism  The result he says was that by 1773  when battles over taxation without representation escalated  Patriots were prepared to defy British administrators  16  Controversial British legislation The Revolution was in some ways incited by a number of pieces of legislation originating from the British Parliament that  for Americans  were illegitimate acts of a government that had no right to pass laws on Englishmen in the Americas who did not have elected representation in that government  For the British  policy makers saw these laws as necessary to rein in colonial subjects who  in the name of economic development that was designed to benefit the home nation  had been allowed near autonomy for too long  1733 1763  Navigation Acts  Molasses Act and Royal Proclamation Eastern North America in 1775  The British Province of Quebec  the Thirteen Colonies on the Atlantic coast and the Indian Reserve as defined by the Royal Proclamation of 1763  The 1763  Proclamation line  is the border between the red and the pink areas  while the orange area represents the Spanish claim  Main articles  Navigation Acts  Molasses Act  and Royal Proclamation of 1763 Further information  Parson s Cause The British Empire at the time operated under the mercantile system  where all trade was concentrated inside the Empire  and trade with other empires was forbidden  The goal was to enrich Britain its merchants and its government  Whether the policy was good for the colonists was not an issue in London  but Americans became increasingly restive with mercantilist policies 17  Britain implemented mercantilism by trying to block American trade with the French  Spanish or Dutch empires using the Navigation Acts  which Americans avoided as often as they could  The royal officials responded to smuggling with open ended search warrants  Writs of Assistance   In 1761  Boston lawyer James Otis argued that the writs violated the constitutional rights of the colonists  He lost the case  but John Adams later wrote   Then and there the child Independence was born   18  In 1762  Patrick Henry argued the Parson s Cause in the Colony of Virginia  where the legislature had passed a law and it was vetoed by the king  Henry argued   that a King  by disallowing Acts of this salutary nature  from being the father of his people  degenerated into a Tyrant and forfeits all right to his subjects  obedience   19  Following their victory in the French and Indian War in 1763  Great Britain took control of the French holdings in North America  outside the Caribbean  The British sought to maintain peaceful relations with those Indian tribes that had allied with the French  and keep them separated from the American frontiersmen  To this end  the Royal Proclamation of 1763 restricted settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains as this was designated an Indian Reserve  20  Disregarding the proclamation  some groups of settlers continued to move west and establish farms  21  The proclamation was soon modified and was no longer a hindrance to settlement  but the fact that it had been promulgated without their prior consultation angered the colonists  22  1764 1766  More provocative legislation Main articles  Sugar Act  Currency Act  Quartering Acts  Stamp Act 1765  and Declaratory Act Further information  No taxation without representation and Virtual representation Britain did not expect the colonies to contribute to the interest or the retirement of debt incurred during its wars  but they did expect a portion of the expenses for colonial defense to be paid by the Americans  Estimating the expenses of defending the continental colonies and the British West Indies to be approximately  200 000 annually  the British goal after the end of this war was that the colonies would be taxed for  78 000 of this amount  The colonists objected chiefly on the grounds not that the taxes were high  they were low  23  but that they had no representation in the Parliament  Parliament insisted it had the right to levy any tax without colonial approval  to demonstrate that it had authority over the colonies  24  Modern American economic historians have challenged the view that Britain was seeking to place a heavy new burden on the colonies and have suggested the real cost of defending the North American colonies from the possibility of invasion by France or Spain was  400 000  five times the maximum income from them  25  The colonists did not object to the principle of contributing to the cost of their defense  colonial legislatures spent large sums raising and outfitting militias during the French and Indian War   but they disputed the need for the Crown to station regular British troops in North America  In the absence of a French threat  colonists believed the colonial militias  which were funded by taxes raised by colonial legislatures  to be sufficient to deal with any trouble with natives on the frontier  Officer positions were in high demand among the British aristocracy the rank of captain or major sold for thousands of pounds  and could be resold once an officer purchased an even higher rank  26  The British wanted all the commissions for themselves  and were unwilling to commission colonial officers  who would pay nothing for their commissions  and further asserted that officers with colonial commissions must submit to the authority of any regular British officer  regardless of rank  This effectively negated the will or the legal authority of the colonies to contribute to defense through their militias  With some 1 500 well connected British officers who would have become redundant in the aftermath of the Seven Years War  London would have had to discharge them if they did not assign them to North America  27  Therefore the main reason for Parliament imposing taxes was to prove its supremacy  and the main use of the tax funds would be patronage for ambitious British officers  28  The slogan  No taxation without representation  summed up this American position  London responded that the colonists were  virtually represented   but most Americans rejected this  29  In 1764  Parliament enacted the Sugar Act and the Currency Act  further vexing the colonists  Protests led to a powerful new weapon  the systematic boycott of British goods  The following year  the British enacted the Quartering Acts  which required British soldiers to be quartered at the expense of residents in certain areas  Colonists objected to this  as well  In 1765 the Stamp Act was the first direct tax levied on the colonies by British Prime Minister George Grenville and the Parliament  All official documents  newspapers  almanacs  and pamphlets  decks of playing cards were required to have the stamps  The colonists still considered themselves loyal subjects of the British Crown  with the same historic rights and obligations as subjects in Britain  30  Nevertheless  representatives of all 13 colonies protested vehemently  as popular leaders such as Patrick Henry in Virginia and James Otis in Massachusetts  rallied the people in opposition  A secret group  the  Sons of Liberty  formed in many towns and threatened violence if anyone sold the stamps  and no one did  31  In Boston  the Sons of Liberty burned the records of the vice admiralty court and looted the home of the chief justice  Thomas Hutchinson  Several legislatures called for united action  and nine colonies sent delegates to the Stamp Act Congress in New York City in October 1765  Moderates led by John Dickinson drew up a  Declaration of Rights and Grievances  stating that taxes passed without representation violated their Rights of Englishmen  Colonists emphasized their determination by boycotting imports of British merchandise  In London  the Rockingham government came to power and Parliament debated whether to repeal the stamp tax or send an army to enforce it  Benjamin Franklin made the case for repeal  explaining the colonies had spent heavily in manpower  money  and blood in defense of the empire in a series of wars against the French and Indians  and that further taxes to pay for those wars were unjust and might bring about a rebellion  Parliament agreed and repealed the tax  but in the Declaratory Act of March 1766 insisted that parliament retained full power to make laws for the colonies  in all cases whatsoever   19  1767 1773  Townshend Acts and the Tea Act Main articles  Townshend Acts and Tea Act Further information  Massachusetts Circular Letter  Boston Massacre  and Boston Tea Party Burning of the Gasp e In 1767  the Parliament passed the Townshend Acts  which placed a tax on a number of essential goods including paper  glass  and tea  Angered at the tax increases  colonists organized a boycott of British goods  In Boston on March 5  1770  a large mob gathered around a group of British soldiers  The mob grew more and more threatening  throwing snowballs  rocks and debris at the soldiers  One soldier was clubbed and fell  All but one of the soldiers fired into the crowd  11 people were hit  three civilians were killed at the scene of the shooting  and two died after the incident  The event quickly came to be called the Boston Massacre  Although the soldiers were tried and acquitted  defended by John Adams   the widespread descriptions soon became propaganda to turn colonial sentiment against the British  This in turn began a downward spiral in the relationship between Britain and the Province of Massachusetts  32  This 1846 lithograph by Nathaniel Currier was entitled  The Destruction of Tea at Boston Harbor   the phrase  Boston Tea Party  had not yet become standard  33  In June 1772  in what became known as the Gasp e Affair  a British warship that had been vigorously enforcing unpopular trade regulations was burned by American patriots including John Brown  About a year later  private letters were published in which Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchinson called for the abridgement of colonial rights  and Lieutenant Governor Andrew Oliver called for the direct payment of colonial officials  until then the purview of the colonial assembly  and a means by which it controlled the governor   The furor over the affair contributed to Hutchinson s recall  and brought a conciliatory Benjamin Franklin firmly to the side of the colonists  On December 16  1773  a group of men  led by Samuel Adams and dressed to evoke American Indians  boarded the ships of the government favored British East India Company and dumped an estimated  10 000 worth of tea from its holds  approximately  636 000 in 2008  into the harbor  This event became known as the Boston Tea Party and remains a significant part of American patriotic lore  34  1774 1775  Quebec Act and the Intolerable Acts A 1774 etching from The London Magazine  copied by Paul Revere of Boston  Prime Minister Lord North  author of the Boston Port Act  forces the Intolerable Acts down the throat of America  whose arms are restrained by Lord Chief Justice Mansfield while Lord Sandwich pins down her feet and peers up her robes  Behind them  Mother Britannia weeps helplessly  Main articles  Quebec Act and Intolerable Acts The Quebec Act of 1774 extended Quebec s boundaries to the Ohio River  shutting out the claims of the 13 colonies  By then  however  the Americans had little regard for new laws from London  they were drilling militia and organizing for war  35  The British government responded by passing several Acts which came to be known as the Intolerable Acts  which further darkened colonial opinion towards the British  They consisted of four laws enacted by the British parliament  36  The first was the Massachusetts Government Act  which altered the Massachusetts charter and restricted town meetings  The second Act  the Administration of Justice Act  ordered that all British soldiers to be tried were to be arraigned in Britain  not in the colonies  The third Act was the Boston Port Act  which closed the port of Boston until the British had been compensated for the tea lost in the Boston Tea Party  the British never received such a payment   The fourth Act was the Quartering Acts of 1774  which allowed royal governors to house British troops in the homes of citizens without requiring permission of the owner  Lord North argued in 1775 for the British position that Englishmen paid on average 25 shillings annually in taxes whereas Americans paid only sixpence  37  The colonists countered that North s argument failed to take into consideration the taxes collected by colonial governments and allocated for local purposes  The colonists believed  especially considering the economic restraints the British were keen to enforce in the colonies  that any additional tax burden from London was excessive  American political opposition Further information  Suffolk Resolves  Declaration of Rights and Grievances  Continental Association  Petition to the King  1774   Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress  Conciliatory Resolution  Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms  Olive Branch Petition  and Hutchinson Letters Affair American political opposition was initially through the colonial assemblies such as the Stamp Act Congress  which included representatives from across the colonies  In 1765  the Sons of Liberty were formed which used public demonstrations  violence and threats of violence to ensure that the British tax laws were unenforceable  While openly hostile to what they considered an oppressive Parliament acting illegally  colonists persisted in sending numerous petitions and pleas for intervention from a monarch to whom they still claimed loyalty  In late 1772 Samuel Adams in Boston set about creating new Committees of Correspondence  which linked Patriots in all 13 colonies and eventually provided the framework for a rebel government  In early 1773 Virginia  the largest colony  set up its Committee of Correspondence  on which Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson served  38  A total of about 7000 to 8000 Patriots served on Committees of Correspondence at the colonial and local levels  comprising most of the leadership in their communities the Loyalists were excluded  The committees became the leaders of the American resistance to British actions  and largely determined the war effort at the state and local level  When the First Continental Congress decided to boycott British products  the colonial and local Committees took charge  examining merchant records and publishing the names of merchants who attempted to defy the boycott by importing British goods  They promoted patriotism and home manufacturing  advising Americans to avoid luxuries and lead more simple lives  The committees gradually extended their power over many aspects of American public life  They set up espionage networks to identify disloyal elements  displaced the royal officials  and helped topple the entire imperial system in each colony  In late 1774 in early 1775  they supervised the elections of provincial conventions  which took over the operation of colonial governments  39  In response to the Massachusetts Government Act  Massachusetts and other colonies formed local governments called Provincial Congresses  In 1774  the First Continental Congress convened  consisting of representatives from each of the Provincial Congresses or their equivalents  to serve as a vehicle for deliberation and collective action  Standing Committees of Safety were created by each Provincial Congress or equivalent for the enforcement of the resolutions by the Committees of Correspondence  Provincial Congress  and the Continental Congress  Some British colonies in North America remained loyal to the Crown  These colonies included Quebec  Nova Scotia  Newfoundland in present day Canada  the former Spanish colonies of West Florida and East Florida  and Bermuda  Factions The population of the 13 Colonies was far from homogeneous  particularly in their political views and attitudes  Loyalties and allegiances varied widely not only within regions and communities  but also within families and sometimes shifted during the course of the Revolution  King George III The war became a personal issue for the king  fueled by his growing belief that British leniency would be taken as weakness by the Americans  The king also sincerely believed he was defending Britain s constitution against usurpers  rather than opposing patriots fighting for their natural rights  40  Patriots Main article  Patriot  American Revolution  Further information  Sons of Liberty At the time  revolutionaries were called  Patriots    Whigs    Congress men   or  Americans   They included a full range of social and economic classes  but were unanimous regarding the need to defend the rights of Americans and uphold the principles of republicanism in terms of rejecting monarchy and aristocracy  while emphasizing civic virtue on the part of the citizens  Role of women Abigail Adams Main article  Women in the American Revolution Women contributed to the American Revolution in many ways  and were involved on both sides  While formal Revolutionary politics did not include women  ordinary domestic behaviors became charged with political significance as Patriot women confronted a war that permeated all aspects of political  civil  and domestic life  They participated by boycotting British goods  spying on the British  following armies as they marched  washing  cooking  and tending for soldiers  delivering secret messages  and in a few cases like Deborah Samson  fighting disguised as men  Above all  they continued the agricultural work at home to feed their families and the armies  They maintained their families during their husbands  absences and sometimes after their deaths  41  American women were integral to the success of the boycott of British goods  42  as the boycotted items were largely household items such as tea and cloth  Women had to return to knitting goods  and to spinning and weaving their own cloth   skills that had fallen into disuse  In 1769  the women of Boston produced 40 000 skeins of yarn  and 180 women in Middletown  Massachusetts wove 20 522 yards  18 765 m  of cloth  41  A crisis of political loyalties could disrupt the fabric of colonial America women s social worlds  whether a man did or did not renounce his allegiance to the King could dissolve ties of class  family  and friendship  isolating women from former connections  A woman s loyalty to her husband  once a private commitment  could become a political act  especially for women in America committed to men who remained loyal to the King  Legal divorce  usually rare  was granted to Patriot women whose husbands supported the King  43  44  Class and psychology Looking back  John Adams concluded in 1818   The Revolution was effected before the war commenced  The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people    This radical change in the principles  opinions  sentiments  and affections of the people was the real American Revolution   45  In terms of class  Loyalists tended to have longstanding social and economic connections to British merchants and government  for instance  prominent merchants in major port cities such as New York  Boston and Charleston tended to be Loyalists  as did men involved with the fur trade along the northern frontier  citation needed  In addition  officials of colonial government and their staffs  those who had established positions and status to maintain  favored maintaining relations with Great Britain  They often were linked to British families in England by marriage as well  citation needed  By contrast  Patriots by number tended to be yeomen farmers  especially in the frontier areas of New York and the backcountry of Pennsylvania  Virginia and down the Appalachian mountains  citation needed  They were craftsmen and small merchants  Leaders of both the Patriots and the Loyalists were men of educated  propertied classes  The Patriots included many prominent men of the planter class from Virginia and South Carolina  for instance  who became leaders during the Revolution  and formed the new government at the national and state levels  citation needed  To understand the opposing groups  historians have assessed evidence of their hearts and minds  In the mid 20th century  historian Leonard Woods Labaree identified eight characteristics of the Loyalists that made them essentially conservative  traits to those characteristic of the Patriots  46  Older and better established men  Loyalists tended to resist innovation  They thought resistance to the Crown which they insisted was the only legitimate government was morally wrong  while the Patriots thought morality was on their side  Loyalists were alienated when the Patriots resorted to violence  such as burning houses and tarring and feathering  Loyalists wanted to take a centrist position and resisted the Patriots  demand to declare their opposition to the Crown  Many Loyalists  especially merchants in the port cities  had maintained strong and long standing relations with Britain  often with business and family links to other parts of the British Empire   Many Loyalists realized that independence was bound to come eventually  but they were fearful that revolution might lead to anarchy  tyranny or mob rule  In contrast  the prevailing attitude among Patriots  who made systematic efforts to use mob violence in a controlled manner  was a desire to seize the initiative  47  48  Labaree also wrote that Loyalists were pessimists who lacked the confidence in the future displayed by the Patriots  46  Historians in the early 20th century  such as J  Franklin Jameson  examined the class composition of the Patriot cause  looking for evidence of a class war inside the revolution  49  In the last 50 years  historians have largely abandoned that interpretation  emphasizing instead the high level of ideological unity  50  Just as there were rich and poor Loyalists  the Patriots were a  mixed lot   with the richer and better educated more likely to become officers in the Army  Ideological demands always came first  the Patriots viewed independence as a means to gain freedom from British oppression and taxation and  above all  to reassert what they considered to be their rights as English subjects  Most yeomen farmers  craftsmen  and small merchants joined the Patriot cause to demand more political equality  They were especially successful in the Pennsylvania but less so in New England  where John Adams attacked Thomas Paine s Common Sense for the  absurd democratical notions  it proposed  51  52  Loyalists Main article  Loyalist  American Revolution  Mobbing the Loyalist by American Patriots in 1775 76  While there is no way of knowing the actual numbers  historians have estimated that about 15 20  of the population remained loyal to the British Crown  these were known at the time as  Loyalists    Tories   or  King s men   The Loyalists never controlled territory unless the British Army occupied it  53  Loyalists were typically older  less willing to break with old loyalties  often connected to the Church of England  and included many established merchants with business connections across the Empire  as well as royal officials such as Thomas Hutchinson of Boston  The revolution sometimes divided families  for example  the Franklins  William Franklin  son of Benjamin Franklin and governor of the Province of New Jersey remained Loyal to the Crown throughout the war and never spoke to his father again  Recent immigrants who had not been fully Americanized were also inclined to support the King  such as recent Scottish settlers in the back country  among the more striking examples of this  see Flora MacDonald  53  After the war  the great majority of the 450 000 500 000 Loyalists remained in America and resumed normal lives  Some  such as Samuel Seabury  became prominent American leaders  Estimates vary  but about 62 000 Loyalists relocated to Canada  and others to Britain  7 000  or to Florida or the West Indies  9 000   This made up approximately 2  of the total population of the colonies  54  When Loyalists left the South in 1783  they took thousands of blacks with them as slaves to the British West Indies  54  Neutrals A minority of uncertain size tried to stay neutral in the war  Most kept a low profile  However  the Quakers  especially in Pennsylvania  were the most important group that was outspoken for neutrality  As Patriots declared independence  the Quakers  who continued to do business with the British  were attacked as supporters of British rule   contrivers and authors of seditious publications  critical of the revolutionary cause  55  Other participants Spain Spain did not officially recognize the U S  but became an informal ally when it declared war on Britain on June 21  1779  Bernardo de G lvez y Madrid  general of the Spanish forces in New Spain  also served as governor of Louisiana  He led an expedition of colonial troops to force the British out of Florida and keep open a vital conduit for supplies  56  France In early 1776  France set up a major program of aid to the Americans  and the Spanish secretly added funds  Each country spent one million  livres tournaises  to buy munitions  A dummy corporation run by Pierre Beaumarchais concealed their activities  Americans obtained some munitions through the Dutch Republic as well as French and Spanish ports in the West Indies  57  Native Americans Most Native Americans rejected pleas that they remain neutral and supported the British Crown  In its trying to prohibit colonial settlement west of the Applachian Mountains  Great Britain was supporting the tribes  The great majority of the 200 000 Native Americans east of the Mississippi distrusted the colonists and supported the British cause  hoping to forestall continued colonial encroachment on their territories  58  Those tribes that were more closely involved in colonial trade tended to side with the revolutionaries  although political factors were important as well  Although there was little major Native American participation during the war except for four of the Iroquois nations  the British provided Indians with funding and weapons to attack American outposts  Some Indians tried to remain neutral  seeing little value in joining a European conflict and fearing reprisals from whichever side they opposed  A few  such as the Oneida and Tuscarora peoples in New York  supported the American cause  59  The British provided arms for the Indians  under Loyalist leadership  to raid frontier settlements from the Carolinas to New York  They killed many scattered settlers  especially in Pennsylvania  In 1776 Cherokee war parties attacked American colonists all along the southern frontier of the uplands  60  While the Chickamauga Cherokee could launch raids numbering a couple hundred warriors  as seen in the Chickamauga Wars  they could not mobilize enough forces to fight a major invasion without the help of allies  these being  most often  the Creek  The most prominent Native American leader siding with the King was Joseph Brant of the powerful Mohawk nation  part of the Iroquois Confederacy based in New York  In 1778 and 1780  he led 300 Iroquois warriors and 100 white Loyalists in multiple attacks on small frontier settlements in New York and Pennsylvania  killing many settlers and destroying villages  crops and stores  61  The Seneca  Onondaga and Cayuga of the Iroquois Confederacy also allied with the British against the Americans  In 1779 the Continentals retaliated with an American army under John Sullivan  which raided and destroyed 40 empty Iroquois villages in central and western New York  62  Sullivan s forces systematically burned the villages and destroyed about 160 000 bushels of corn that comprised the winter food supply  Facing starvation and homeless for the winter  the Iroquois fled to the Niagara Falls area and to Canada  mostly to what became Ontario  The British resettled them there after the war  providing land grants as compensation for some of their losses  63  At the peace conference following the war  the British ceded lands which they did not really control  and did not consult about it with their Indian allies  They  transferred  control to the Americans of all the land east of the Mississippi and north of Florida  The historian Calloway concludes  Burned villages and crops  murdered chiefs  divided councils and civil wars  migrations  towns and forts choked with refugees  economic disruption  breaking of ancient traditions  losses in battle and to disease and hunger  betrayal to their enemies  all made the American Revolution one of the darkest periods in American Indian history  64  The British did not give up their forts in the West  what is now the Ohio to Wisconsin  until 1796  they kept alive the dream of forming a satellite Indian nation there  which they called a Neutral Indian Zone  That goal was one of the causes of the War of 1812  65  66  African Americans Further information  Slavery in the United States Free blacks in the North and South fought on both sides of the Revolution  but most fought for the colonial rebels  Crispus Attucks  who died in a conflict in Boston in 1770  is considered the first martyr of the American Revolution  Both sides offered freedom and re settlement to slaves who were willing to fight for them  especially targeting slaves whose owners supported the opposing cause  Many African American slaves became politically active during these years in support of the King  as they thought Great Britain might abolish slavery in the colonies  Tens of thousands used the turmoil of war to escape  and the southern plantation economies of South Carolina and Georgia especially were disrupted  During the Revolution  the British tried to turn slavery against the Americans  67  but historian David Brion Davis explains the difficulties with a policy of wholesale arming of the slaves  But England greatly feared the effects of any such move on its own West Indies  where Americans had already aroused alarm over a possible threat to incite slave insurrections  The British elites also understood that an all out attack on one form of property could easily lead to an assault on all boundaries of privilege and social order  as envisioned by radical religious sects in Britain s seventeenth century civil wars  68  Davis underscored the British dilemma   Britain  when confronted by the rebellious American colonists  hoped to exploit their fear of slave revolts while also reassuring the large number of slave holding Loyalists and wealthy Caribbean planters and merchants that their slave property would be secure   69  The colonists accused the British of encouraging slave revolts  70  American advocates of independence were commonly lampooned in Britain for what was termed their hypocritical calls for freedom  at the same time that many of their leaders were planters who held hundreds of slaves  Samuel Johnson snapped   how is it we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the  slave  drivers of the Negroes   71  Benjamin Franklin countered by criticizing the British self congratulation about  the freeing of one Negro   Somersett  while they continued to permit the Slave Trade  72  Phyllis Wheatley  a black poet who popularized the image of Columbia to represent America  came to public attention when her Poems on Various Subjects  Religious and Moral appeared in 1773  73  During the war  slaves escaped from across New England and the mid Atlantic area to British occupied cities  such as New York  The effects of the war were more dramatic in the South  In Virginia the royal governor Lord Dunmore recruited black men into the British forces with the promise of freedom  protection for their families  and land grants  Tens of thousands of slaves escaped to British lines throughout the South  causing dramatic losses to slaveholders and disrupting cultivation and harvesting of crops  For instance  South Carolina was estimated to lose about 25 000 slaves  or one third of its slave population  to flight  migration or death  From 1770 1790  the black proportion of the population  mostly slaves  in South Carolina dropped from 60 5 percent to 43 8 percent  and in Georgia from 45 2 percent to 36 1 percent  74  When the British evacuated its forces from Savannah and Charleston  it also gave transportation to 10 000 slaves  carrying through on its commitment to them  75  They evacuated and resettled more than 3 000  Black Loyalists  to Nova Scotia  Upper and Lower Canada  Others sailed with the British to England or were resettled in the West Indies of the Caribbean  More than 1200 of the Black Loyalists of Nova Scotia later resettled in the British colony of Sierra Leone  where they became leaders of the Krio ethnic group of Freetown and the later national government  Many of their descendants still live in Sierra Leone  as well as other African countries  76  Some slaves understood Revolutionary rhetoric as promising freedom and equality  Both British and American governments made promises of freedom for service  and many slaves fought in one or the other armies  Starting in 1777  northern states started to abolish slavery  beginning with Vermont  which ended it under its new state constitution  By court cases  Massachusetts effectively ended slavery before the end of the century  Usually states instituted abolition on a gradual schedule with no government compensation of the owners  and many states  such as New York  New Jersey and Connecticut  required long apprenticeships of former slave children before they gained freedom and came of age as adults  In the first two decades after the war  the legislatures of Virginia  Maryland and Delaware made it easier for slaveholders to manumit their slaves  77  Numerous slaveholders in the Upper South took advantage of the changes  the proportion of free blacks went from less than one percent before the war to more than 10 percent overall by 1810  78  In Virginia alone  the number of free blacks climbed  from less than one percent in 1782  to 4 2 percent in 1790  and 13 5 percent in 1810  78  In Delaware  three quarters of blacks were free by 1810  79  After this time  few slaves were freed in the South  except those who were favorites or the master s children  The demand for slaves rose with the growth of cotton as a commodity crop  especially after the invention of the cotton gin  which enabled the widespread cultivation of short staple cotton in the upland regions  Although the international slave trade was prohibited  the slave population in the United States increased by the formation of families and survival of children throughout the South  As the demand for slave labor in the Upper South decreased due to changes in crops  planters began selling their slaves to traders and markets to the Deep South in an internal slave trade  it would cause the forced migration of an estimated one million slaves during the following decades  breaking up countless families  as young males were most in demand  Military hostilities begin Join  or Die by Benjamin Franklin was recycled to encourage the former colonies to unite against British rule Further information  Shot heard round the world  Boston campaign  and Invasion of Canada  1775  The Battle of Lexington and Concord took place April 19  1775  when the British sent a force of roughly 1000 troops to confiscate arms and arrest revolutionaries in Concord  Massachusetts  80  They clashed with the local militia  marking the first fighting of the American Revolutionary War  The news aroused the 13 colonies to call out their militias and send troops to besiege Boston  The Battle of Bunker Hill followed on June 17  1775  While a British victory  it was at a great cost  about 1 000 British casualties from a garrison of about 6 000  as compared to 500 American casualties from a much larger force  81  82  The Second Continental Congress convened in 1775  after the war had started  The Congress created the Continental Army and extended the Olive Branch Petition to the crown as an attempt at reconciliation  King George III refused to receive it  issuing instead the Proclamation of Rebellion  requiring action against the  traitors   In the winter of 1775  the Americans invaded Canada  General Richard Montgomery captured Montreal but a joint attack on Quebec with the help of Benedict Arnold failed  In March 1776  with George Washington as the commander of the new army  the Continental Army forced the British to evacuate Boston  The revolutionaries were now in full control of all 13 colonies and were ready to declare independence  While there still were many Loyalists  they were no longer in control anywhere by July 1776  and all of the Royal officials had fled  83  Prisoners Main article  Prisoners in the American Revolutionary War In August 1775  George III declared Americans in arms against royal authority to be traitors to the Crown  The British government at first started treating captured rebel combatants as common criminals and preparations were made to bring them to trial for treason  American Secretary Lord Germain and First Lord of the Admiralty Lord Sandwich were especially eager to do so  with a particular emphasis on those who had previously served in British units  and thereby sworn an oath of allegiance to the crown   Many of the prisoners taken by the British at Bunker Hill apparently expected to be hanged  but British authorities declined to take the next step  treason trials and executions  The dilemma was that tens of thousands of Loyalists were under American control and American retaliation would have been easy  The British built much of their strategy around using these Loyalists  After the surrender at Saratoga in October 1777  furthermore  there were thousands of British and Hessian soldiers in American hands  Therefore no Americans were put on trial for treason  The British maltreated the prisoners they held  resulting in more deaths to American sailors and soldiers than combat operations  84  At the end of the war  both sides released their surviving prisoners  85  Finance Britain s war against the Americans  French and Spanish cost about  100 million  The Treasury borrowed 40  of the money it needed  86  Heavy spending brought France to the verge of bankruptcy and revolution  while the British had relatively little difficulty financing their war  keeping their suppliers and soldiers paid  and hiring tens of thousands of German soldiers  Britain had a sophisticated financial system based on the wealth of thousands of landowners  who supported the government  together with banks and financiers in London  The efficient British tax system collected about 12 percent of the GDP in taxes during the 1770s  87  In sharp contrast  Congress and the American states had no end of difficulty financing the war  88  In 1775 there was at most 12 million dollars in gold in the colonies  not nearly enough to cover current transactions  let alone on a major war  The British made the situation much worse by imposing a tight blockade on every American port  which cut off almost all imports and exports  One partial solution was to rely on volunteer support from militiamen  and donations from patriotic citizens  Another was to delay actual payments  pay soldiers and suppliers in depreciated currency  and promise it would be made good after the war  Indeed  in 1783 the soldiers and officers were given land grants to cover the wages they had earned but had not been paid during the war  Not until 1781  when Robert Morris was named Superintendent of Finance of the United States  did the national government have a strong leader in financial matters  Morris used a French loan in 1782 to set up the private Bank of North America to finance the war  Seeking greater efficiency  Morris reduced the civil list  saved money by using competitive bidding for contracts  tightened accounting procedures  and demanded the federal government s full share of money and supplies from the states  89  Congress used four main methods to cover the cost of the war  which cost about 66 million dollars in specie  gold and silver   90  Congress made two issues of paper money  in 1775 1780  and in 1780 81  The first issue amounted to 242 million dollars  This paper money would supposedly be redeemed for state taxes  citation needed  but the holders were eventually paid off in 1791 at the rate of one cent on the dollar  citation needed  By 1780  the paper money was  not worth a Continental   as people said  and a second issue of new currency was attempted  The second issue quickly became nearly worthless but it was redeemed by the new federal government in 1791 at 100 cents on the dollar  citation needed  At the same time the states  especially Virginia and the Carolinas  issued over 200 million dollars of their own currency  citation needed  In effect  the paper money was a hidden tax on the people  and indeed was the only method of taxation that was possible at the time  citation needed  The skyrocketing inflation was a hardship on the few people who had fixed incomes but 90 percent of the people were farmers  and were not directly affected by that inflation  Debtors benefited by paying off their debts with depreciated paper  91  The greatest burden was borne by the soldiers of the Continental Army  whose wages usually in arrears declined in value every month  weakening their morale and adding to the hardships suffered by their families  citation needed  Beginning in 1777  Congress repeatedly asked the states to provide money  But the states had no system of taxation either  and were little help  By 1780 Congress was making requisitions for specific supplies of corn  beef  pork and other necessities an inefficient system that kept the army barely alive  92  93  Starting in 1776  the Congress sought to raise money by loans from wealthy individuals  promising to redeem the bonds after the war  The bonds were in fact redeemed in 1791 at face value  but the scheme raised little money because Americans had little specie  and many of the rich merchants were supporters of the Crown  citation needed  Starting in 1776  the French secretly supplied the Americans with money  gunpowder  and munitions in order to weaken its arch enemy  Great Britain  When France officially entered the war in 1778  the subsidies continued  and the French government  as well as bankers in Paris and Amsterdam loaned large sums to the American war effort  These loans were repaid in full in the 1790s  94  Creating new state constitutions Following the Battle of Bunker Hill in June 1775  the Patriots had control of most of Massachusetts  the Loyalists suddenly found themselves on the defensive  In all 13 colonies  Patriots had overthrown their existing governments  closing courts and driving British governors  agents and supporters from their homes  They had elected conventions and  legislatures  that existed outside of any legal framework  new constitutions were used in each state to supersede royal charters  They declared they were states now  not colonies  95  On January 5  1776  New Hampshire ratified the first state constitution  six months before the signing of the Declaration of Independence  Then  in May 1776  Congress voted to suppress all forms of crown authority  to be replaced by locally created authority  Virginia  South Carolina  and New Jersey created their constitutions before July 4  Rhode Island and Connecticut simply took their existing royal charters and deleted all references to the crown  96  The new states had to decide not only what form of government to create  they first had to decide how to select those who would craft the constitutions and how the resulting document would be ratified  In states where the wealthy exerted firm control over the process  such as Maryland  Virginia  Delaware  New York and Massachusetts  the results were constitutions that featured  Substantial property qualifications for voting and even more substantial requirements for elected positions  though New York and Maryland lowered property qualifications   95  Bicameral legislatures  with the upper house as a check on the lower  Strong governors  with veto power over the legislature and substantial appointment authority  Few or no restraints on individuals holding multiple positions in government  The continuation of state established religion  Benjamin Rush  1783 In states where the less affluent had organized sufficiently to have significant power especially Pennsylvania  New Jersey  and New Hampshire the resulting constitutions embodied universal white manhood suffrage  or minimal property requirements for voting or holding office  New Jersey enfranchised some property owning widows  a step that it retracted 25 years later   strong  unicameral legislatures  relatively weak governors  without veto powers  and little appointing authority  prohibition against individuals holding multiple government posts  Whether conservatives or radicals held sway in a state did not mean that the side with less power accepted the result quietly  The radical provisions of Pennsylvania s constitution lasted only 14 years  In 1790  conservatives gained power in the state legislature  called a new constitutional convention  and rewrote the constitution  The new constitution substantially reduced universal white male suffrage  gave the governor veto power and patronage appointment authority  and added an upper house with substantial wealth qualifications to the unicameral legislature  Thomas Paine called it a constitution unworthy of America  1  Independence and Union Johannes Adam Simon Oertel  Pulling Down the Statue of King George III  N Y C   ca  1859  The painting is a romanticised version of the Sons of Liberty destroying the symbol of monarchy in Bowling Green following the reading on the New York City commons of the United States Declaration of Independence to the Continental Army and residents on July 9th  1776 by George Washington  Further information  Lee Resolution  Articles of Confederation  Committee of Five  and United States Declaration of Independence In April the North Carolina Provincial Congress issued the Halifax Resolves  explicitly authorizing its delegates to vote for independence  97  In May Congress called on all the states to write constitutions  and eliminate the last remnants of royal rule  By June nine colonies were ready for independence  one by one the last four  Pennsylvania  Delaware  Maryland and New York   fell into line  Richard Henry Lee was instructed by the Virginia legislature to propose independence  and he did so on June 7  1776  On the 11th a committee was created to draft a document explaining the justifications for separation from Britain  After securing enough votes for passage  independence was voted for on July 2  The Declaration of Independence  drafted largely by Thomas Jefferson and presented by the committee  was slightly revised and unanimously adopted by the entire Congress on July 4  marking the formation of a new sovereign nation  which called itself the United States of America  98  The Second Continental Congress approved a new constitution  the  Articles of Confederation   for ratification by the states on November 15  1777  and immediately began operating under their terms  The Articles were formally ratified on March 1  1781  At that point  the Continental Congress was dissolved and on the following day a new government of the United States in Congress Assembled took its place  with Samuel Huntington as presiding officer  99  100  Defending the Revolution Main article  American Revolutionary War British return  1776 1777 Further information  New York and New Jersey campaign  Staten Island Peace Conference  Saratoga campaign  and Philadelphia campaign After Washington forced the British out of Boston in spring 1776  neither the British nor the Loyalists controlled any significant areas  The British  however  were massing forces at their naval base at Halifax  Nova Scotia  They returned in force in July 1776  landing in New York and defeating Washington s Continental Army at the Battle of Brooklyn in August  one of the largest engagements of the war  After the Battle of Brooklyn  the British requested a meeting with representatives from Congress to negotiate an end to hostilities  A delegation including John Adams and Benjamin Franklin met Howe on Staten Island in New York Harbor on September 11  in what became known as the Staten Island Peace Conference  Howe demanded a retraction of the Declaration of Independence  which was refused  and negotiations ended until 1781  The British then quickly seized New York City and nearly captured General Washington  They made the city their main political and military base of operations in North America  holding it until November 1783  New York City consequently became the destination for Loyalist refugees  and a focal point of Washington s intelligence network  101  102  The British also took New Jersey  pushing the Continental Army into Pennsylvania  but in a surprise attack in late December 1776 Washington crossed the Delaware River back into New Jersey and defeated Hessian and British armies at Trenton and Princeton  thereby regaining New Jersey  The victories gave an important boost to pro independence supporters at a time when morale was flagging  and have become iconic events of the war  In 1777  as part of a grand strategy to end the war  the British sent an invasion force from Canada to seal off New England  which the British perceived as the primary source of agitators  In a major case of mis coordination  the British army in New York City went to Philadelphia which it captured from Washington  The invasion army under Burgoyne waited in vain for reinforcements from New York  and became trapped in northern New York state  It surrendered after the Battle of Saratoga in October 1777  From early October 1777 until November 15 a pivotal siege at Fort Mifflin  Philadelphia  Pennsylvania distracted British troops and allowed Washington time to preserve the Continental Army by safely leading his troops to harsh winter quarters at Valley Forge  American alliances after 1778 Further information  France in the American Revolutionary War and Spain in the American Revolutionary War The capture of a British army at Saratoga encouraged the French to formally enter the war in support of Congress  as Benjamin Franklin negotiated a permanent military alliance in early 1778  significantly becoming the first country to officially recognize the Declaration of Independence  On February 6  1778  a Treaty of Amity and Commerce and a Treaty of Alliance were signed between the United States and France  103 William Pitt spoke out in parliament urging Britain to make peace in America  and unite with America against France  while other British politicians who had previously sympathised with colonial grievances now turned against the American rebels for allying with British international rival and enemy  104  Later Spain  in 1779  and the Dutch  1780  became allies of the French  leaving the British Empire to fight a global war alone without major allies  and requiring it to slip through a combined blockade of the Atlantic  The American theater thus became only one front in Britain s war  105  The British were forced to withdraw troops from continental America to reinforce the valuable sugar producing Caribbean colonies  which were considered more important  Because of the alliance with France and the deteriorating military situation  Sir Henry Clinton  the British commander  evacuated Philadelphia to reinforce New York City  General Washington attempted to intercept the retreating column  resulting in the Battle of Monmouth Court House  the last major battle fought in the north  After an inconclusive engagement  the British successfully retreated to New York City  The northern war subsequently became a stalemate  as the focus of attention shifted to the smaller southern theater  106  Hessian troops hired out to the British by their German sovereigns The British move South  1778 1783 Further information  Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War and Naval operations in the American Revolutionary War The British strategy in America now concentrated on a campaign in the southern colonies  With fewer regular troops at their disposal  the British commanders saw the  southern strategy  as a more viable plan  as the south was perceived as being more strongly Loyalist  with a large population of recent immigrants as well as large numbers of slaves who might be captured or run away to join the British  107  Beginning in late December 1778  the British captured Savannah and controlled the Georgia coastline  In 1780 they launched a fresh invasion and took Charleston as well  A significant victory at the Battle of Camden meant that royal forces soon controlled most of Georgia and South Carolina  The British set up a network of forts inland  hoping the Loyalists would rally to the flag  Not enough Loyalists turned out  however  and the British had to fight their way north into North Carolina and Virginia  with a severely weakened army  Behind them much of the territory they had already captured dissolved into a chaotic guerrilla war  fought predominantly between bands of Loyalist and American militia  which negated many of the gains the British had previously made  108  Yorktown 1781 The siege of Yorktown ended with the surrender of a second British army  marking effective British defeat Main article  Siege of Yorktown The British army under Cornwallis marched to Yorktown  Virginia where they expected to be rescued by a British fleet  109  The fleet showed up but so did a larger French fleet  so the British fleet after the Battle of the Chesapeake returned to New York for reinforcements  leaving Cornwallis trapped  In October 1781 under a combined siege by the French and Continental armies under Washington  the British surrendered their second invading army of the war  110  The war winds down Support for the conflict had never been strong in Britain  where many sympathized with the rebels  but now it reached a new low  111  Although King George III personally wanted to fight on  his supporters lost control of Parliament  and no further major land offensives were launched in the American Theater  106  112  Washington could not know that after Yorktown the British would not reopen hostilities  They still had 26 000 troops occupying New York City  Charleston and Savannah  together with a powerful fleet  The French army and navy departed  so the Americans were on their own in 1782 83  113  The treasury was empty  and the unpaid soldiers were growing restive  almost to the point of mutiny or possible coup d  tat  The unrest among officers of the Newburgh Conspiracy was personally dispelled by Washington in 1783  and Congress subsequently created the promise of a five years bonus for all officers  114  Peace treaty Main article  Treaty of Paris  1783  The peace treaty with Britain  known as the Treaty of Paris  gave the U S  all land east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes  though not including Florida  On September 3  1783  Britain entered into a separate agreement with Spain under which Britain ceded Florida back to Spain   The British abandoned the Indian allies living in this region  they were not a party to this treaty and did not recognize it until they were defeated militarily by the United States  Issues regarding boundaries and debts were not resolved until the Jay Treaty of 1795  115  Since the blockade was lifted and the old imperial restrictions were gone  American merchants were free to trade with any nation anywhere in the world  and their businesses flourished  Impact on Britain Losing the war and the 13 colonies was a shock to Britain  The war revealed the limitations of Britain s fiscal military state when it discovered it suddenly faced powerful enemies  with no allies  and dependent on extended and vulnerable transatlantic lines of communication  The defeat heightened dissension and escalated political antagonism to the King s ministers  Inside parliament  the primary concern changed from fears of an over mighty monarch to the issues of representation  parliamentary reform  and government retrenchment  Reformers sought to destroy what they saw as widespread institutional corruption  The result was a powerful crisis  1776 1783  The peace in 1783 left France financially prostrate  while the British economy boomed thanks to the return of American business  The crisis ended after 1784 thanks to the King s shrewdness in outwitting Charles James Fox  the leader of the Fox North Coalition   and renewed confidence in the system engendered by the leadership of the new Prime Minister  William Pitt  Historians conclude that loss of the American colonies enabled Britain to deal with the French Revolution with more unity and better organization than would otherwise have been the case  116  117  Concluding the Revolution Main articles  Philadelphia Convention and United States Bill of Rights See also  Annapolis Convention and Federalist Papers Creating a  more perfect union  and guaranteeing rights After the war finally ended in 1783  there was a period of prosperity  with the entire world at peace  The national government  still operating under the Articles of Confederation  was able to settle the issue of the western territories  which were ceded by the states to Congress  American settlers moved rapidly into those areas  with Vermont  Kentucky and Tennessee becoming states in the 1790s  118  However  the national government had no money to pay either the war debts owed to European nations  the private banks  or to Americans who had been given millions of dollars of promissory notes for supplies during the war  Nationalists  led by Washington  Alexander Hamilton and other veterans  feared that the new nation was too fragile to withstand an international war  or even internal revolts such as the Shays  Rebellion of 1786 in Massachusetts  Calling themselves  Federalists   the nationalists convinced Congress to call the Philadelphia Convention in 1787  119  It adopted a new Constitution that provided for a much stronger federal government  including an effective executive in a check and balance system with the judiciary and legislature  120  After a fierce debate in the states over the nature of the proposed new government  the Constitution was ratified in 1788  The new government under President George Washington took office in New York in March 1789  121  As assurances to those who were cautious about federal power  amendments to the Constitution guaranteeing many of the inalienable rights that formed a foundation for the revolution were spearheaded in Congress by James Madison  and later ratified by the states in 1791  National debt Further information  United States public debt and Alexander Hamilton The national debt after the American Revolution fell into three categories  The first was the  12 million owed to foreigners mostly money borrowed from France  There was general agreement to pay the foreign debts at full value  The national government owed  40 million and state governments owed  25 million to Americans who had sold food  horses  and supplies to the revolutionary forces  There were also other debts that consisted of promissory notes issued during the Revolutionary War to soldiers  merchants  and farmers who accepted these payments on the premise that the new Constitution would create a government that would pay these debts eventually  The war expenses of the individual states added up to  114 million compared to  37 million by the central government  122  In 1790  at the recommendation of first Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton  Congress combined the remaining state debts with the foreign and domestic debts into one national debt totaling  80 million  Everyone received face value for wartime certificates  so that the national honor would be sustained and the national credit established  123  Impressions the Revolution made Loyalist expatriation About 60 000 to 70 000 Loyalists left the newly founded republic  some left for Britain and the remainder  called United Empire Loyalists received British subsidies to resettle in British colonies in North America  especially Quebec  concentrating in the Eastern Townships   Prince Edward Island  and Nova Scotia  124  The new colonies of Upper Canada  now Ontario  and New Brunswick were created by Britain for their benefit  However  about 80  of the Loyalists stayed and became loyal citizens of the United States  and some of the exiles later returned to the U S  125  Interpretations Interpretations about the effect of the Revolution vary  Though contemporary participants referred to the events as  the revolution   126  at one end of the spectrum is the view that the American Revolution was not  revolutionary  at all  contending that it did not radically transform colonial society but simply replaced a distant government with a local one  127  More recent scholarship pioneered by historians such as Bernard Bailyn  Gordon Wood  and Edmund Morgan accepts the contemporary view of the participants that the American Revolution was a unique and radical event that produced deep changes and had a profound impact on world affairs  based on an increasing belief in the principles of the Enlightenment as reflected in how liberalism was understood during the period  and republicanism  These were demonstrated by a leadership and government that espoused protection of natural rights  and a system of laws chosen by the people  128  As an example or inspiration Further information  Atlantic Revolutions After the Revolution  genuinely democratic politics became possible  129  The rights of the people were incorporated into state constitutions  Thus came the widespread assertion of liberty  individual rights  equality and hostility toward corruption which would prove core values of liberal republicanism to Americans  The greatest challenge to the old order in Europe was the challenge to inherited political power and the democratic idea that government rests on the consent of the governed  The example of the first successful revolution against a European empire  and the first successful establishment of a republican form of democratically elected government  provided a model for many other colonial peoples who realized that they too could break away and become self governing nations with directly elected representative government  130  The Dutch Republic  also at war with Britain at that time  was the next country after France to sign a treaty with the United States  on October 8  1782  103  On April 3  1783  Ambassador Extraordinary Gustaf Philip Creutz  representing King Gustav III of Sweden  and Benjamin Franklin  Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States of America  signed a Treaty of Amity and Commerce with the U S  103  The American Revolution was the first wave of the Atlantic Revolutions that took hold in the French Revolution  the Haitian Revolution  and the Latin American wars of independence  Aftershocks reached Ireland in the Irish Rebellion of 1798  in the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth  and in the Netherlands  131  The Revolution had a strong  immediate impact in Great Britain  Ireland  the Netherlands  and France  Many British and Irish Whigs spoke in favor of the American cause  The Revolution  along with the Dutch Revolt  end of the 16th century  and the English Civil War  in the 17th century   was one of the first lessons in overthrowing an old regime for many Europeans who later were active during the era of the French Revolution  such as Marquis de Lafayette  The American Declaration of Independence had some impact on the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen of 1789  132  133  The spirit of the Declaration of Independence led to laws ending slavery in all the Northern states and the Northwest Territory  with New Jersey the last in 1804 long before the British Parliament acted in 1833 to abolish slavery in its colonies  134  See also Diplomacy in the American Revolutionary War Founding Fathers of the United States List of plays and films about
