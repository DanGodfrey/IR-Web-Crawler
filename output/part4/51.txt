Watchmen From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search This article is about the comic book limited series  For the live action adaptation  see Watchmen  film   For other uses  see Watchman  disambiguation   Watchmen Cover art for the 1987 U S   left  and 1995 U S  UK Canada  right  collected editions of Watchmen  published by DC Comics and Titan Books  Publication information Publisher DC Comics Schedule Monthly Format Limited series Genre Superhero Publication date September 1986   October 1987 Number of issues 12 Creative team Writer s  Alan Moore Artist s  Dave Gibbons Letterer s  Dave Gibbons Colorist s  John Higgins Editor s  Len WeinBarbara Kesel Watchmen is a twelve issue comic book limited series created by writer Alan Moore  artist Dave Gibbons  and colourist John Higgins  The series was published by DC Comics during 1986 and 1987  and has been subsequently reprinted in collected form  Watchmen originated from a story proposal Moore submitted to DC featuring superhero characters that the company had acquired from Charlton Comics  As Moore s proposed story would have left many of the characters unusable for future stories  managing editor Dick Giordano convinced him to create original characters instead  Moore used the story as a means to reflect contemporary anxieties and to critique the superhero concept  Watchmen depicts an alternate history where superheroes emerged in the 1940s and 1960s  helping the United States to win the Vietnam War  The country is edging towards a nuclear war with the Soviet Union  freelance costumed vigilantes have been outlawed and most former superheroes are in retirement or working for the government  The story focuses on the personal development and struggles of the protagonists as an investigation into the murder of a government sponsored superhero pulls them out of retirement  and eventually leads them to confront a plot that would stave off nuclear war by killing millions of people  Creatively  the focus of Watchmen is on its structure  Gibbons used a nine panel grid layout throughout the series and added recurring symbols such as a blood stained smiley  All but the last issue feature supplemental fictional documents that add to the series  backstory  and the narrative is intertwined with that of another story  a fictional pirate comic titled Tales of the Black Freighter  which one of the characters reads  Structured as a nonlinear narrative  the story skips through space  time and plot  Watchmen has received critical acclaim both in the comics and mainstream press  and is regarded by critics as a seminal text of the comics medium  After a number of attempts to adapt the series into a feature film  director Zack Snyder s Watchmen was released in

be a good way to start a comic book  have a famous super hero found dead   As the mystery unraveled  we would be led deeper and deeper into the real heart of this super hero s world  and show a reality that was very different to the general public image of the super hero   Alan Moore on the basis for Watchmen 1  In 1985  DC Comics acquired a line of characters from Charlton Comics  2  During that period  writer Alan Moore contemplated writing a story that featured an unused line of superheroes that he could revamp  as he had done in his Miracleman series in the early 1980s  Moore reasoned that MLJ Comics  Mighty Crusaders might be available for such a project  so he devised a murder mystery plot which would begin with the discovery of the body of The Shield in a harbour  The writer felt it did not matter which set of characters he ultimately used  as long as readers recognized them  so it would have the shock and surprise value when you saw what the reality of these characters was   1  Moore used this premise and crafted a proposal featuring the Charlton characters titled Who Killed the Peacemaker  3  and submitted the unsolicited proposal to DC managing editor Dick Giordano  2  Giordano was receptive to the proposal  but the editor opposed the idea of using the Charlton characters for the story  Moore said   DC realized their expensive characters would end up either dead or dysfunctional   Instead  Giordano persuaded Moore to continue with new characters  4  Moore had initially believed that original characters would not provide emotional resonance for the readers  but later changed his mind  He said   Eventually  I realized that if I wrote the substitute characters well enough  so that they seemed familiar in certain ways  certain aspects of them brought back a kind of generic super hero resonance or familiarity to the reader  then it might work   1  Alan Moore  writer of Watchmen and Dave Gibbons  artist on Watchmen  Artist Dave Gibbons  who had collaborated with Moore on previous projects  heard the writer was working on a limited series treatment  The artist said he wanted to be involved  so Moore sent him the story outline  5  Gibbons told Giordano he wanted to draw the series Moore proposed and Moore approved  6  Gibbons brought colorist John Higgins onto the project because he liked his  unusual  style  Higgins lived near the artist  which allowed the two to  discuss  the art  and have some kind of human contact rather than just sending it across the ocean   3 Len Wein joined the project as its editor  while Giordano stayed on to oversee it  Both Wein and Giordano stood back and  got out of their way   Giordano remarked later   Who copyedits Alan Moore  for God s sake   2  After receiving the go ahead to work on the project  Moore and Gibbons spent a day at the latter s house creating characters  crafting details for the story s milieu and discussing influences  4  The pair was particularly influenced by a Mad parody of Superman named  Superduperman   Moore said   We wanted to take Superduperman 180 degrees dramatic  instead of comedic   4  Moore and Gibbons conceived of a story that would take  familiar old fashioned superheroes into a completely new realm   7  the writer said his intention was to create  a superhero Moby Dick  something that had that sort of weight  that sort of density   8  The writer came up with the character names and descriptions  but left the specifics of how they looked to Gibbons  Gibbons did not sit down and design the characters deliberately  but rather  did it at odd times     spend ing  maybe two or three weeks just doing sketches   3  Gibbons designed his characters to make them easy to draw  Rorschach was his favorite to draw because  you just have to draw a hat  If you can draw a hat  then you ve drawn Rorschach  you just draw kind of a shape for his face and put some black blobs on it and you re done   9  Moore began writing the series very early on  hoping to avoid publication delays such as those faced by the DC limited series Camelot 3000  10  When writing the script for the first issue  Moore said he realized  I only had enough plot for six issues  We were contracted for 12   His solution was to alternate issues that dealt with the overall plot of the series with origin issues for the characters  11  Moore wrote very detailed scripts for Gibbons to work from  Gibbons recalled that   t he script for the first issue of Watchmen was  I think  101 pages of typescript single spaced with no gaps between the individual panel descriptions or  indeed  even between the pages   12  Upon receiving the scripts  the artist had to number each page  in case I drop them on the floor  because it would take me two days to put them back in the right order   and used a highlighter pen to single out lettering and shot descriptions  he remarked   It takes quite a bit of organizing before you can actually put pen to paper   12  Despite Moore s detailed scripts  his panel descriptions would often end with the note  If that doesn t work for you  do what works best   Gibbons nevertheless worked to Moore s instructions  13  Gibbons had a great deal of autonomy in developing the visual look of Watchmen  and frequently inserted background details that Moore admitted he did not notice until later  8  Moore occasionally contacted fellow comics writer Neil Gaiman for answers to research questions and for quotes to include in issues  11  Despite his intentions  Moore admitted in November 1986 that there were likely to be delays  stating that he was  with issue five on the stands  still writing issue nine  12  Gibbons mentioned that a major factor in the delays was the  piecemeal way  in which he received Moore s scripts  Gibbons said the team s pace slowed around the fourth issue  from that point onwards the two undertook their work  just several pages at a time  I ll get three pages of script from Alan and draw it and then toward the end  call him up and say   Feed me   And he ll send another two or three pages or maybe one page or sometimes six pages   14  As the creators began to hit deadlines  Moore would hire a taxi driver to drive 50 miles and deliver scripts to Gibbons  On later issues the artist had his wife and son draw panel grids on pages to help save time  11  Moore even shortened one of Ozymandias  narrations  because Gibbons was unable to compress the dialogue on to one page where Ozymandias prevents a sneak attack by Rorschach  15  Near the end of the project  Moore realized that the story bore some similarity to  The Architects of Fear   an episode of The Outer Limits television series  11  The writer and Wein argued over changing the ending  Moore won  but acknowledged the episode by referencing it in the series  last issue  13   edit  Story Watchmen is set in an alternate reality which closely mirrors the contemporary world of the 1980s  The primary difference is the presence of superheroes  The point of divergence occurs in the year 1938  Their existence in this version of America is shown to have dramatically affected and altered the outcomes of real world events such as the Vietnam War and the presidency of Richard Nixon  16  In keeping with the realism of the series  although the costumed crimefighters of Watchmen are commonly called  superheroes   the only character who possesses obvious superhuman powers is Doctor Manhattan  17  The existence of Doctor Manhattan has given the U S  a strategic advantage over the Soviet Union  which has increased tensions between the two nations  Eventually  superheroes grow unpopular among the police and the public  which has led to the passage of legislation in 1977 to outlaw them  While many of the heroes retired  Doctor Manhattan and The Comedian operate as government sanctioned agents  and Rorschach continues to operate outside the law  18   edit  Plot In October 1985  New York City police are investigating the murder of Edward Blake  With the police having no leads  costumed vigilante Rorschach decides to probe further  Discovering Blake to be the face behind The Comedian  a costumed hero employed by the United States government  Rorschach believes he has discovered a plot to terminate costumed adventurers and sets about warning four of his retired comrades  Dan Dreiberg  formerly the second Nite Owl   the superpowered and emotionally detached Doctor Manhattan and his lover Laurie Juspeczyk  the second Silk Spectre   and Adrian Veidt  once the hero Ozymandias  and now a successful businessman   After Blake s funeral  Doctor Manhattan is accused on national television of being the cause of cancer in friends and former colleagues  When the U S  government takes the accusations seriously  Manhattan exiles himself to Mars  In doing so  he throws humanity into political turmoil  with the Soviet Union invading Afghanistan to capitalize on the perceived American weakness  Rorschach s paranoid beliefs appear vindicated when Adrian Veidt narrowly survives an assassination attempt  and Rorschach himself is framed for murdering Moloch  a former supervillain  Neglected in her relationship with Manhattan  and no longer kept on retainer by the government  Juspeczyk stays with Dreiberg  they don their costumes and resume vigilante work as they grow closer together  With Dreiberg starting to believe some aspects of Rorschach s conspiracy theory  the pair take it upon themselves to break him out of prison  Doctor Manhattan  after looking back on his own personal history  places the fate of his involvement with human affairs in Juspeczyk s hands  He teleports her to Mars to make the case for emotional investment  During the course of the argument  Juspeczyk is forced to come to terms with the fact that Blake  who once attempted to rape her mother  was in fact her biological father following a second  consensual relationship  This discovery  reflecting the complexity of human emotions and relationships  re sparks Doctor Manhattan s interest in humanity  On Earth  Nite Owl and Rorschach continue to uncover the conspiracy surrounding the death of The Comedian and the accusations that drove Doctor Manhattan into exile  They discover evidence that Adrian Veidt may be behind the plan  Rorschach writes his suspicions about Veidt in his journal  and mails it to New Frontiersman  a small  right wing newspaper in New York  The pair then confront Veidt at his Antarctic retreat  Veidt explains his underlying plan is to save humanity from impending Atomic war between the United States and Soviet Union by faking an alien invasion in New York City  which will annihilate half the city s population  He hopes this will unite the nations against a perceived common enemy  He also reveals that he had murdered The Comedian  arranged for Dr  Manhattan s past associates to contract cancer  staged the attempt on his own life in order to place himself above suspicion  and eventually staged Moloch s death to frame Rorschach  This was all done in an attempt to prevent his plan from being exposed  Finding his logic callous and abhorrent  Dreiberg and Rorschach attempt to stop him but discover that Veidt had already enacted his plan  When Doctor Manhattan and Juspeczyk arrive back on Earth  they are confronted by mass destruction and wide scale death in New York City  Doctor Manhattan notices his abilities are limited by tachyons emanating from the Antarctic  and the pair teleport there  They discover Veidt s involvement and confront him  Veidt shows everyone news broadcasts confirming the cessation of global hostilities and cooperation against a new threat  this leads almost all present to agree that concealing Veidt s truth from the public is in the best interests of the world to keep it united  Rorschach refuses to compromise and leaves  intent on revealing the truth  As he is making his way back  he is confronted by Manhattan  Rorschach tells him that Manhattan will have to kill him to stop him from exposing Veidt and his actions  and Manhattan responds by vaporizing him  Manhattan then wanders through the base and finds Veidt  who asks Manhattan if he did the right thing in the end  In response  Manhattan states that  Nothing ever ends  before leaving the Earth for a different galaxy  Dreiberg and Juspeczyk go into hiding under new identities and continue their romance  Back in New York  the editor at New Frontiersman complains about having to pull a two page column about Russia due to the new political climate  He asks his assistant to find some filler material from the crank file  a collection of rejected submissions to the paper  many of which had not even been reviewed  The series ends with the young man reaching towards the pile of discarded submissions  near the top of which is Rorschach s journal   edit  Characters The main characters of Watchmen  from left to right   Ozymandias  the second Silk Spectre  Doctor Manhattan  The Comedian  kneeling   the second Nite Owl  and Rorschach  Main article  Characters of Watchmen With Watchmen  Alan Moore s intention was to create four or five  radically opposing ways  to perceive the world and to give readers of the story the privilege of determining which one was most morally comprehensible  Moore did not believe in the notion of   cramming  regurgitated morals  down the readers  throats and instead sought to show heroes in an ambivalent light  Moore said   What we wanted to do was show all of these people  warts and all  Show that even the worst of them had something going for them  and even the best of them had their flaws   8  Edward Blake   The Comedian  One of two government sanctioned heroes  along with Doctor Manhattan  who remains active after the Keene Act is passed in 1977 to ban superheroes  His murder  which occurs shortly before the first chapter begins  sets the plot of Watchmen in motion  The character appears throughout the story in flashbacks and aspects of his personality are revealed by other characters  18  The Comedian was based on the Charlton Comics character Peacemaker  with elements of the Marvel Comics spy character Nick Fury added  Moore and Gibbons saw The Comedian as  a kind of Gordon Liddy character  only a much bigger  tougher guy   1  Richard Reynolds described The Comedian as  ruthless  cynical  and nihilistic  and yet capable of deeper insights than the others into the role of the costumed hero   18  Although he attempted to rape the first Silk Spectre in the 1940s  issue nine reveals that years later he fathered her daughter Laurie as part of a consensual sexual relationship  Dr  Jon Osterman   Doctor Manhattan  A superpowered being who is contracted by the United States government  Scientist Jon Osterman gained power over matter when he was caught in an  Intrinsic Field Subtractor  in 1959  Doctor Manhattan was based upon Charlton s Captain Atom  who in Moore s original proposal was surrounded by the shadow of nuclear threat  However  the writer found he could do more with Manhattan as a  kind of a quantum super hero  than he could have with Captain Atom  1  In contrast to other superheroes who lacked scientific exploration of their origins  Moore sought to delve into nuclear physics and quantum physics in constructing the character of Dr  Manhattan  The writer believed that a character living in a quantum universe would not perceive time with a linear perspective  which would influence the character s perception of human affairs  Moore also wanted to avoid creating an emotionless character like Spock from Star Trek  so he sought for Dr  Manhattan to retain  human habits  and to grow away from them and humanity in general  8  Gibbons had created the blue character Rogue Trooper  and explained he reused the blue skin motif for Doctor Manhattan as it resembles skin tonally  but has a different hue  Moore incorporated the color into the story  and Gibbons noted the rest of the comic s color scheme made Manhattan unique  19  Moore recalled that he was unsure if DC would allow the creators to depict the character as fully nude  which partially influenced how they portrayed the character  3  Gibbons wanted to be tasteful in depicting Manhattan s nudity  selecting carefully when full frontal shots would occur and giving him  understated  genitals like a classical sculpture so the reader would not initially notice it  20  Daniel Dreiberg   Nite Owl  A retired superhero who utilizes owl themed gadgets  Nite Owl was based on the Ted Kord version of the Blue Beetle  Paralleling the way that Ted Kord had a predecessor  Moore also incorporated an earlier adventurer who used the name  Nite Owl   the retired crime fighter Hollis Mason  into Watchmen  1  While Moore devised character notes for Gibbons to work from  the artist provided a name and a costume design for Hollis Mason he had created when he was twelve  20  Richard Reynolds noted in Super Heroes  A Modern Mythology that despite the character s Charlton roots  Nite Owl s modus operandi has more in common with the DC Comics character Batman  21  According to Klock  his civilian form  visually suggests an impotent  middle aged Clark Kent   22  Adrian Veidt   Ozymandias  Drawing inspiration from Alexander the Great  Veidt was once the superhero Ozymandias  but has since retired to devote his attention to the running of his own enterprises  Veidt is believed to be the smartest man on the planet  Ozymandias was directly based on Peter Cannon  Thunderbolt  Moore liked the idea of a character who  us ed  the full 100  of his brain  and   had  complete physical and mental control   1  Richard Reynolds noted that by taking initiative to  help the world   Veidt displays a trait normally attributed to villains in superhero stories  and in a sense he is the  villain  of the series  23  Gibbons noted  One of the worst of his sins  is  kind of looking down on the rest of humanity  scorning the rest of humanity   24  Walter Joseph Kovacs   Rorschach  A vigilante who wears a white mask that contains a symmetrical but constantly shifting ink blot pattern  he continues to fight crime in spite of his outlaw status  Moore said he was trying to  come up with this quintessential Steve Ditko character someone who s got a funny name  whose surname begins with a  K   who s got an oddly designed mask   Moore based Rorschach on Ditko s creation Mr  A  12  Ditko s Charlton character The Question also served as a template for creating Rorschach  1  Comics historian Bradford W  Wright described the character s world view  a set of black and white values that take many shapes but never mix into shades of gray  similar to the ink blot tests of his namesake   Rorschach sees existence as random and  according to Wright  this viewpoint leaves the character  free to  scrawl  his  own design  on a  morally blank world    25  Moore said he did not foresee the death of Rorschach until the fourth issue when he realized that his refusal to compromise would result in him not surviving the story  8  Laurie Juspeczyk   Silk Spectre  The daughter of Sally Jupiter  the first Silk Spectre  with whom she has a strained relationship   and The Comedian  She had been the lover of Doctor Manhattan for years  While Silk Spectre was based partially on the Charlton character Nightshade  Moore was not impressed by the character and drew more from heroines such as Black Canary and Phantom Lady  1   edit  Art and composition Moore and Gibbons designed Watchmen to showcase the unique qualities of the comics medium and to highlight its particular strengths  In a 1986 interview  Moore said   What I d like to explore is the areas that comics succeed in where no other media is capable of operating   and emphasized this by stressing the differences between comics and film  Moore said that Watchmen was designed to be read  four or five times   with some links and allusions only becoming apparent to the reader after several readings  8  Dave Gibbons notes that    a s it progressed  Watchmen became much more about the telling than the tale itself  The main thrust of the story essentially hinges on what is called a macguffin  a gimmick     So really the plot itself is of no great consequence     it just really isn t the most interesting thing about Watchmen  As we actually came to tell the tale  that s where the real creativity came in   26  Gibbons said he deliberately constructed the visual look of Watchmen so that each page would be identifiable as part of that particular series and  not some other comic book   27  He made a concerted effort to draw the characters in a manner different than that commonly seen in comics  27  The artist tried to draw the series with  a particular weight of line  using a hard  stiff pen that didn t have much modulation in terms of thick and thin  which he hoped  would differentiate it from the usual lush  fluid kind of comic book line   28  In a 2009 interview  Moore recalled that he took advantage of Gibbons  training as a former surveyor for  including incredible amounts of detail in every tiny panel  so we could choreograph every little thing   29  Gibbons described the series as  a comic about comics   14  Gibbons felt that  Alan is more concerned with the social implications of  the presence of super heroes  and I ve gotten involved in the technical implications   The story s alternate world setting allowed Gibbons to change details of the American landscape  such as adding electric cars  slightly different buildings  and spark hydrants instead of fire hydrants  which Moore said   perhaps gives the American readership a chance in some ways to see their own culture as an outsider would   Gibbons noted that the setting was liberating for him because he did not have to rely primarily on reference books  3  Colorist John Higgins used a template that was  moodier  and favored secondary colors  11  Moore stated that he had also  always loved John s coloring  but always associated him with being an airbrush colorist   which Moore was not fond of  Higgins subsequently decided to color Watchmen in European style flat color  Moore noted that the artist paid particular attention to lighting and subtle color changes  in issue six  Higgins began with  warm and cheerful  colors and throughout the issue gradually made it darker to give the story a dark and bleak feeling  3   edit  Structure The middle two pages of Watchmen  5  titled  Fearful Symmetry   The whole of the issue s layout was intended to be symmetrical  culminating in this center spread  where the pages reflect one another  Art by Dave Gibbons  Structurally  certain aspects of Watchmen deviated from the norm in comic books at the time  particularly the panel layout and the coloring  Instead of panels of various sizes  the creators divided each page into a nine panel grid  11  Gibbons favored the nine panel grid system due to its  authority   28  Moore accepted the use of the nine panel grid format  which  gave him a level of control over the storytelling he hadn t had previously   according to Gibbons   There was this element of the pacing and visual impact that he could now predict and use to dramatic effect   26 Bhob Stewart of The Comics Journal mentioned to Gibbons in 1987  that the page layouts recalled those of EC Comics  in addition to the art itself  which Stewart felt particularly echoed that of John Severin  14  Gibbons agreed that the echoing of the EC style layouts  was a very deliberate thing   although his inspiration was rather Harvey Kurtzman  15  but it was altered enough to give the series a unique look  14  The artist also cited Steve Ditko s work on early issues of The Amazing Spider Man as an influence  30  as well as Doctor Strange  where  even at his most psychedelic  he  would still keep a pretty straight page layout   9  The cover of each issue serves as the first panel to the story  Gibbons said   The cover of the Watchmen is in the real world and looks quite real  but it s starting to turn into a comic book  a portal to another dimension   3  The covers were designed as close ups that focused on a single detail with no human elements present  8  The creators on occasion experimented with the layout of the issue contents  Gibbons drew issue five  titled  Fearful Symmetry   so the first page mirrors the last  in terms of frame disposition   with the following pages mirroring each other before the center spread is  broadly  symmetrical in layout  3  The end of each issue  with the exception of issue twelve  contains supplemental prose pieces written by Moore  Among the contents are fictional book chapters  letters  reports  and articles written by various Watchmen characters  DC had trouble selling ad space in issues of Watchmen  which left an extra eight to nine pages per issue  DC planned to insert house ads and a longer letters column to fill the space  but editor Len Wein felt this would be unfair to anyone who wrote in during the last four issues of the series  He decided to use the extra pages to fill out the series  backstory  13  Moore said   By the time we got around to issue  3   4  and so on  we thought that the book looked nice without a letters page  It looks less like a comic book  so we stuck with it   3   edit  Tales of the Black Freighter For the direct to video supplement to the comic book s film adaptation  see Watchmen  film  Home media  Watchmen features a story within a story in the form of Tales of the Black Freighter  a fictional comic book from which scenes appear in issues three  five  eight  ten and eleven  The fictional comic s story   Marooned   is read by a youth in New York City  23  Moore and Gibbons conceived a pirate comic because they reasoned that since the characters of Watchmen experience superheroes in real life   they probably wouldn t be at all interested in superhero comics   31  Gibbons suggested a pirate theme  and Moore agreed in part because he is  a big Bertolt Brecht fan   the Black Freighter alludes to the song  Seer uberjenny    Pirate Jenny   from Brecht s Threepenny Opera  3  Moore theorized that since superheroes existed  and existed as  objects of fear  loathing  and scorn  the main superheroes quickly fell out of popularity in comic books  as we suggest  Mainly  genres like horror  science fiction  and piracy  particularly piracy  became prominent with EC riding the crest of the wave   12  Moore felt that  the imagery of the whole pirate genre is so rich and dark that it provided a perfect counterpoint to the contemporary world of Watchmen   12  The writer expanded upon the premise so that its presentation in the story would add subtext and allegory  32  The supplemental article detailing the fictional history of Tales of the Black Freighter at the end of issue five credits real life artist Joe Orlando as a major contributor to the series  Moore chose Orlando because he felt that if pirate stories were popular in the Watchmen universe that DC editor Julius Schwartz might have tried to lure the artist over to the company to draw a pirate comic book  Orlando contributed a drawing designed as if it were a page from the fake title to the supplemental piece  12  In  Marooned   a young mariner  called  The Sea Captain   journeys to warn his home town of the coming of the Black Freighter  after he survives the destruction of his own ship  He uses the bodies of his dead shipmates as a make shift raft  When he finally returns home  believing it to be already under the occupation of the Black Freighter s crew  he kills an innocent couple and then attacks his own wife in their darkened home  mistaking her for a pirate  After realizing what he has done  he returns to the sea shore  where he finds that the Black Freighter has not come to claim the town  it has come to claim him  He swims out to sea and climbs aboard the ship  According to Richard Reynold  the mariner is  forced by the urgency of his mission to shed one inhibition after another   Just like Adrian Veidt  he  hopes to stave off disaster by using the dead bodies of his former comrades as a means of reaching his goal   33  Moore stated that the story of The Black Freighter ends up specifically describing  the story of Adrian Veidt  and that it can also be used as a counterpoint to other parts of the story  such as Rorschach s capture and Dr  Manhattan s self exile on Mars  31   edit  Symbols and imagery Moore named William S  Burroughs as one of his main influences during the conception of Watchmen  He admired Burroughs  use of  repeated symbols that would become laden with meaning  in Burroughs  only comic strip   The Unspeakable Mr  Hart   which appeared in the British underground magazine Cyclops  Not every intertextual link in the series was planned by Moore  who remarked that  there s stuff in there Dave had put in that even I only noticed on the sixth or seventh read   while other  things     turned up in there by accident   8  The Galle crater from the planet Mars appears in Watchmen as an example of the series  recurring smiley motif A blood stained smiley face is a recurring image in the story  appearing in many forms  In The System of Comics  Thierry Groensteen described the symbol as a recurring motif that produces  rhyme and remarkable configurations  by appearing in key segments of Watchmen  notably the first and last pages of the series  Groensteen cites it as one form of the circle shape that appears throughout the story  as a  recurrent geometric motif  and due to its symbolic connotations  34  Gibbons created a smiley face badge as an element of The Comedian s costume in order to  lighten  the overall design  later adding a splash of blood to the badge to imply his murder  Gibbons said the creators came to regard the blood stained smiley face as  a symbol for the whole series   28  noting its resemblance to the Doomsday Clock ticking up to midnight  9  Moore drew inspiration from psychological tests of behaviorism  explaining that the tests had presented the face as  a symbol of complete innocence   With the addition of a blood splash over the eye  the face s meaning was altered to become simultaneously radical and simple enough for the first issue s cover to avoid human detail  Although most evocations of the central image were created on purpose  others were coincidental  Moore mentioned in particular that  the little plugs on the spark hydrants  if you turn them upside down  you discover a little smiley face   8  Other symbols  images and allusion that appeared throughout the series often emerged unexpectedly  Moore mentioned that   t he whole thing with Watchmen has just been loads of these little bits of synchronicity popping up all over the place   12  Gibbons noted an unintended theme was contrasting the mundane and the romantic  15  citing the separate sex scenes between Nite Owl and Silk Spectre on his couch and then high in the sky on Nite Owl s airship  14  In a book of the craters and boulders of Mars  Gibbons discovered a photograph of the Galle crater  which resembles a happy face  which they worked into an issue  Moore said   We found a lot of these things started to generate themselves as if by magic   in particular citing an occasion where they decided to name a lock company the  Gordian Knot Lock Company   12   edit  Themes The initial premise for the series was to examine what superheroes would be like  in a credible  real world   As the story became more complex  Moore said Watchmen became about  power and about the idea of the superman manifest within society   35  The title of the series refers to the question  Who watches the watchmen    although Moore said in a 1986 interview with Amazing Heroes he did not know where that sentence originated  36  After reading the interview  author Harlan Ellison informed Moore that the sentence is a translation of the question  Quis custodiet ipsos custodes    posed by the Roman satirist Juvenal  Moore commented in 1987   In the context of Watchmen  that fits   They re watching out for us  who s watching out for them    3  The writer stated in the introduction to the Graphitti hardcover of Watchmen that while writing the series he was able to purge himself of his nostalgia for superheroes  and instead he found an interest in real human beings  1  Graffiti similar to that which appears in Watchmen  Hemel Hempstead  May 2008  Bradford Wright described Watchmen as  Moore s obituary for the concept of heroes in general and superheroes in particular   17  Putting the story in a contemporary sociological context  Wright wrote that the characters of Watchmen were Moore s  admonition to those who trusted in  heroes  and leaders to guard the world s fate   He added that to place faith in such icons was to give up personal responsibility to  the Reagans  Thatchers  and other  Watchmen  of the world who supposed to  rescue  us and perhaps lay waste to the planet in the process   37  Moore specifically stated in 1986 that he was writing Watchmen to be  not anti Americanism   but  anti Reaganism   specifically believing that  at the moment a certain part of Reagan s America isn t scared  They think they re invulnerable   3  While Moore wanted to write about  power politics  and the  worrying  times he lived in  he stated the reason that the story was set in an alternate reality was because he was worried that readers would  switch off  if he attacked a leader they admired  4  Moore stated in 1986 that he  was consciously trying to do something that would make people feel uneasy   3  Citing Watchmen as the point where the comic book medium  came of age   Iain Thomson wrote in his essay  Deconstructing the Hero  that the story accomplished this by  developing its heroes precisely in order to deconstruct the very idea of the hero and so encouraging us to reflect upon its significance from the many different angles of the shards left lying on the ground   38  Thomson stated that the heroes in Watchmen almost all share a nihilistic outlook  and that Moore presents this outlook  as the simple  unvarnished truth  to  deconstruct the would be hero s ultimate motivation  namely  to provide a secular salvation and so attain a mortal immortality   39  He wrote that the story  develops its heroes precisely in order to ask us if we would not in fact be better off without heroes   40  Thomson added that the story s deconstruction of the hero concept  suggests that perhaps the time for heroes has passed   which he feels distinguishes  this postmodern work  from the deconstructions of the hero in the existentialism movement  41  Richard Reynolds states that without any supervillains in the story  the superheroes of Watchmen are forced to confront  more intangible social and moral concerns   adding that this removes the superhero concept from the normal narrative expectations of the genre  42  Reynolds concludes that the series  ironic self awareness of the genre  all mark out Watchmen either as the last key superhero text  or the first in a new maturity of the genre   43  Geoff Klock eschewed the term  deconstruction  in favor of describing Watchmen as a  revisionary superhero narrative   He considers Watchmen and Frank Miller s Batman  The Dark Knight Returns to be  the first instances     of  a  new kind of comic book     a first phase of development  the transition of the superhero from fantasy to literature   44  He elaborates by noting that  Alan Moore s realism     performs a kenosis towards comic book history      which  does not ennoble and empower his characters     Rather  it sends a wave of disruption back through superhero history     devalue ing  one of the basic superhero conventions by placing his masked crime fighters in a realistic world   45  First and foremost   Moore s exploration of the  often sexual  motives for costumed crimefighting sheds a disturbing light on past superhero stories  and forces the reader to reevaluate to revision every superhero in terms of Moore s kenosis his emptying out of the tradition   46  Klock relates the title to the quote by Juvenal to highlight the problem of controlling those who hold power and quoted repeatedly within the work itself  47  The deconstructive nature of Watchmen is  Klock notes  played out on the page also as    l ike Alan Moore s kenosis   Veidt  must destroy  then reconstruct  in order to build  a unity which would survive him    48  Moore has expressed dismay that   t he gritty  deconstructivist postmodern superhero comic  as exemplified by Watchmen     became a genre   He said in 2003 that  to some degree there has been  in the 15 years since Watchmen  an awful lot of the comics field devoted to these grim  pessimistic  nasty  violent stories which kind of use Watchmen to validate what are  in effect  often just some very nasty stories that don t have a lot to recommend them   49  Gibbons said that while readers  were left with the idea that it was a grim and gritty kind of thing   he said in his view the series was  a wonderful celebration of superheroes as much as anything else   50   edit  Publication and reception Alan Moore  co creator of Watchmen  severed his ties with DC Comics over contractual issues related to the work  When Moore and Gibbons turned in the first issue of Watchmen to DC  their peers were stunned  Gibbons recalled   What really clinched it     was  writer artist  Howard Chaykin  who doesn t give praise lightly  and who came up and said   Dave what you ve done on Watchmen is fuckin  A    51  Speaking in 1986  Moore stated that  DC backed us all the way     and have been really supportive about even the most graphic excesses   3  To promote the series  DC Comics released a limited edition badge   button   display card set  featuring characters and images from the series  Ten thousand sets of the four badges  including a replica of the blood stained smiley face badge worn by the Comedian in the story  were released and sold  14  Mayfair Games introduced a Watchmen module for its DC Heroes Role playing Game series that was released before the series concluded  The module  which was endorsed by Moore  adds details to the series  backstory by portraying events that occurred in 1966  52  Watchmen was published in single issue form over the course of 1986 and 1987  The limited series was a commercial success  and its sales helped DC Comics briefly overtake its competitor Marvel Comics in the comic book direct market  37  The series  publishing schedule ran into delays because it was scheduled with three issues completed instead of the six Len Wein believed were necessary  Further delays were caused when later issues each took more than a month to complete  13  Bhob Stewart of The Comics Journal noted in Spring 1987 that issue 12  which DC solicited for April 1987   looks like it won t debut until July or August   12  After the series concluded  the individual issues were collected and sold in trade paperback form  Along with Frank Miller s 1986 Batman  The Dark Knight Returns mini series  Watchmen was marketed as a  graphic novel   a term which allowed DC and other publishers to sell similar comic book collections in a way that associated them with novels  but dissociated them from comics  53  As a result of the publicity given to the books like the Watchmen trade in 1987  bookstore and public libraries began to devote special shelves to them  Subsequently  new comics series were commissioned on the basis of reprinting them in a collected form for these markets  54  In 1987  Graphitti Design produced a special limited edition  slipcased hardcover volume that contained 48 pages of bonus material  including the original proposal and concept art  In 2005  DC released Absolute Watchmen  an oversized slipcased hardcover edition of the series in DC s Absolute Edition format  Assembled under the supervision of Dave Gibbons  Absolute Watchmen included the Graphitti materials  as well as restored and recolored art by John Higgins  55  In 2008  Warner Bros  Entertainment released Watchmen Motion Comics  a series of narrated animations of the original comic book  The first chapter was released for purchase in the summer of 2008 on digital video stores  such as iTunes Store  56  That December  DC published a new printing of Watchmen issue  1 at the original 1986 cover price of  1 50  57  A DVD compiling the full motion comic series was released in March 2009  58  Watchmen received critical praise  both inside and outside of the comics industry  Time magazine  which noted that the series was  by common assent the best of breed  of the new wave of comics published at the time  praised Watchmen as  a superlative feat of imagination  combining sci fi  political satire  knowing evocations of comics past and bold reworkings of current graphic formats into a dysutopian  sic  mystery story   59  In 1988  Watchmen received a Hugo Award in the Other Forms category  60   edit  Ownership disputes Disagreements about the ownership of the story ultimately led Alan Moore to sever ties with DC Comics  61  Not wanting to work under a work for hire arrangement  Moore and Gibbons had a reversion clause in their contract for Watchmen  Speaking at the 1985 San Diego Comic Con  Moore said  The way it works  if I understand it  is that DC owns it for the time they re publishing it  and then it reverts to Dave and me  so we can make all the money from the Slurpee cups   10  For Watchmen  Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons received eight percent of the series  earnings  8  Moore explained in 1986 that his understanding was that when  DC have not used the characters for a year  they re ours   3  Both Moore and Gibbons said DC paid them  a substantial amount of money  to retain the rights  Moore added   So basically they re not ours  but if DC is working with the characters in our interests then they might as well be  On the other hand  if the characters have outlived their natural life span and DC doesn t want to do anything with them  then after a year we ve got them and we can do what we want with them  which I m perfectly happy with   3  Moore said he left DC in 1989 due to the language in his contracts for Watchmen and his V for Vendetta series with artist David Lloyd  Moore felt the reversion clauses were ultimately meaningless  because DC did not intend to let the publications go out of print  He told The New York Times in 2006   I said   Fair enough          You have managed to successfully swindle me  and so I will never work for you again    61  In 2000  Moore publicly distanced himself from DC s plans for a fifteenth anniversary Watchmen hardcover release as well as a proposed line of action figures from DC Direct  While DC wanted to mend its relationship with the writer  Moore felt the company was not treating him fairly in regards to his America s Best Comics imprint  launched under the WildStorm comic imprint  which was bought by DC in 1998  Moore was promised no direct interference by DC as part of the arrangement   Moore added   As far as I m concerned  the 15th anniversary of Watchmen is purely a 15th Anniversary of when DC managed to take the Watchmen property from me and Dave  Gibbons    62  Soon afterwards  DC Direct cancelled the Watchmen action figure line  although the company had shown prototypes at the 2000 San Diego Comic Con International  63   edit  Prequel projects Main article  Before Watchmen Moore stated in 1985 that if the limited series was well received  he and Gibbons would possibly create a 12 issue prequel series called Minutemen featuring the 1940s superhero group from the story  10  DC offered Moore and Gibbons chances to publish prequels to the series  such as Rorschach s Journal or The Comedian s Vietnam War Diary  as well as hinting at the possibility of other authors using the same universe  Tales of the Comedian s Vietnam War experiences were floated because The  Nam was popular at the time  while another suggestion was  according to Gibbons  for a  Nite Owl Rorschach team   in the manner of Randall and Hopkirk  Deceased    Neither man felt the stories would have gone anywhere  with Moore particularly adamant that DC not go forward with stories by other individuals  64  Gibbons was more attracted to the idea of a Minutemen series  because it would have   paid  homage to the simplicity and unsophisticated nature of Golden Age comic books with the added dramatic interest that it would be a story whose conclusion is already known  It would be  perhaps  interesting to see how we got to the conclusion   15  In 2010  Moore told Wired that DC offered him the rights to Watchmen back earlier that week  if he would agree to prequel and sequel projects  Moore said that  if they said that 10 years ago  when I asked them for that  then yeah it might have worked     But these days I don t want Watchmen back  Certainly  I don t want it back under those kinds of terms   DC Comics co publishers Dan DiDio and Jim Lee responded   DC Comics would only revisit these iconic characters if the creative vision of any proposed new stories matched the quality set by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons nearly 25 years ago  and our first discussion on any of this would naturally be with the creators themselves   65  Following months of rumors about a potential Watchmen follow up project  in February 2012 DC announced it was publishing seven prequel series under the  Before Watchmen  banner  Among the creators involved are writers J  Michael Straczynski  Brian Azzarello  Darwyn Cooke  and Len Wein  and artists Lee Bermejo  J  G  Jones  Adam Hughes  Andy Kubert  Joe Kubert  and Amanda Conner  Though Moore has no involvement  Gibbons gave the project his blessing  66   edit  Film adaptation Main article  Watchmen  film  See also  Production of Watchmen There have been numerous attempts to make a film version of Watchmen since 1986  when producers Lawrence Gordon and Joel Silver acquired film rights to the series for 20th Century Fox  67  Fox asked Alan Moore to write a screenplay based on his story  68  but he declined  so the studio enlisted screenwriter Sam Hamm  Hamm took the liberty of re writing Watchmen s complicated ending into a  more manageable  conclusion involving an assassination and a time paradox  68  Fox put the project into turnaround in 1991  69  and the project was moved to Warner Bros   where Terry Gilliam was attached to direct and Charles McKeown to rewrite it  They used the character Rorschach s diary as a voice over and restored scenes from the comic book that Hamm had removed  68  Gilliam and Silver were only able to raise  25 million for the film  a quarter of the necessary budget  because their previous films had gone overbudget  68  Gilliam abandoned the project because he decided that Watchmen would have been unfilmable   Reducing  the story  to a two or two and a half hour film       seemed to me to take away the essence of what Watchmen is about   he said  70  After Warner Bros  dropped the project  Gordon invited Gilliam back to helm the film independently  The director again declined  believing that the comic book would be better directed as a five hour miniseries  71  Interior set of Nite Owl s vehicle  Archie  from the film version of Watchmen  displayed at Comic Con 2008  In October 2001  Gordon partnered with Lloyd Levin and Universal Studios  hiring David Hayter to write and direct  72  Hayter and the producers left Universal due to creative differences  73  and Gordon and Levin expressed interest in setting up Watchmen at Revolution Studios  The project did not hold together at Revolution Studios and subsequently fell apart  74  In July 2004  it was announced Paramount Pictures would produce Watchmen  and they attached Darren Aronofsky to direct Hayter s script  Producers Gordon and Levin remained attached  collaborating with Aronofsky s producing partner  Eric Watson  75 Paul Greengrass replaced Aronofsky when he left to focus on The Fountain  76  Ultimately  Paramount placed Watchmen in turnaround  77  In October 2005  Gordon and Levin met with Warner Bros  to develop the film there again  78  Impressed with Zack Snyder s work on 300  Warner Bros  approached him to direct an adaptation of Watchmen  79  Screenwriter Alex Tse drew from his favorite elements of Hayter s script  80  but also returned it to the original Cold War setting of the Watchmen comic  Similar to his approach to 300  Snyder used the comic book as a storyboard  81  He extended the fight scenes  82  and added a subplot about energy resources to make the film more topical  83  Although he intended to stay faithful to the look of the characters in the comic  Snyder intended Nite Owl to look scarier  81  and made Ozymandias  armor into a parody of the rubber muscle suits from the 1997 superhero film Batman  amp  Robin  15  After the trailer to the film premiered in July 2008  DC Comics president Paul Levitz said that the company had to print more than 900 000 copies of Watchmen trade collection to meet the additional demand for the book that the advertising campaign had generated  with the total annual print run expected to be over one million copies  84  While 20th Century Fox filed a lawsuit to block the film s release  the studios eventually settled  and Fox received an upfront payment and a percentage of the worldwide gross from the film and all sequels and spin offs in return  85  The film was released to theaters in March 2009  The Tales of the Black Freighter segments was adapted as a direct to video animated feature to be released that same month  86 Gerard Butler  who starred in 300  voices the Captain in the film  87  The film itself was released on DVD four months after Tales of the Black Freighter  and Warner Bros  is speculated to be considering releasing an extended version  with the animated film edited back into the main picture  86  Len Wein  the comic s editor  wrote a video game prequel entitled Watchmen  The End Is Nigh  88  Dave Gibbons became an adviser on Snyder s film  but Moore has refused to have his name attached to any film adaptations of his work  89  Moore has stated he has no interest in seeing Snyder s adaptation  he told Entertainment Weekly in 2008   There are things that we did with Watchmen that could only work in a comic  and were indeed designed to show off things that other media can t   90  While Moore believes that David Hayter s screenplay was  as close as I could imagine anyone getting to Watchmen   he asserted he did not intend to see the film if it were made  91   edit  Legacy Since its release  Watchmen has garnered acclaim as a seminal work of the comic book medium  In Art of the Comic Book  An Aesthetic History  Robert Harvey wrote that with Watchmen  Moore and Gibbons  had demonstrated as never before the capacity of the  comic book  medium to tell a sophisticated story that could be engineered only in comics   92  In his review of the Absolute Edition of the collection  Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times wrote that the dark legacy of Watchmen   one that Moore almost certainly never intended  whose DNA is encoded in the increasingly black inks and bleak storylines that have become the essential elements of the contemporary superhero comic book   is  a domain he has largely ceded to writers and artists who share his fascination with brutality but not his interest in its consequences  his eagerness to tear down old boundaries but not his drive to find new ones   93  In 1999  The Comics Journal ranked Watchmen at number 91 on its list of the Top 100 English Language Comics of the 20th Century  94 Watchmen was the only graphic novel to appear on Time s 2005  All TIME 100 Greatest Novels  list  95 Time critic Lev Grossman described the story as  a heart pounding  heartbreaking read and a watershed in the evolution of a young medium   96  In 2008  Entertainment Weekly placed it at number 13 on its list of the best 50 novels printed in the last 25 years  describing it as  The greatest superhero story ever told and proof that comics are capable of smart  emotionally resonant narratives worthy of the label literature   97  In 2009 Lydia Millet of The Wall Street Journal contested that Watchmen was worthy of such acclaim  and wrote that while the series   vividly drawn panels  moody colors and lush imagery make its popularity well deserved  if disproportionate   that  it s simply bizarre to assert that  as an illustrated literary narrative  it rivals in artistic merit  say  masterpieces like Chris Ware s  Acme Novelty Library  or almost any part of the witty and brilliant work of Edward Gorey   98  Watchmen was one of the two comic books that inspired designer Vincent Connare when he created the popular Comic Sans font  99  In 2009  Brain Scan Studios released the parody Watchmensch  a comic in which writer Rich Johnston based the story around  the debate surrounding Watchmen  the original contracts  the current legal suits over the Fox contract   100   edit  References Comics portal Speculative fiction portal Superhero fiction portal United States portal Eury  Michael  Giordano  Dick  Dick Giordano
