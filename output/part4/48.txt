fictional galaxy  Many species of alien creatures  often humanoid  are depicted  Robotic droids are also commonplace and are generally built to serve their owners  Space travel is common  and many planets in the galaxy are members of a Galactic Republic  later reorganized as the Galactic Empire  One of the prominent elements of Star Wars is the  Force   an omnipresent energy that can be harnessed by those with that ability  It is described in the first produced film as  an energy field created by all living things  that  surrounds us  penetrates us   and  binds the galaxy together   3  The Force allows users to perform various supernatural feats  such as telekinesis  clairvoyance  precognition  and mind control  and can amplify certain physical traits  such as speed and reflexes  these abilities vary between characters and can be improved through training  While the Force can be used for good  it has a dark side that  when pursued  imbues users with hatred  aggression  and malevolence  The six films feature the Jedi  who use the Force for good  and the Sith  who use the dark side for evil in an attempt to take over the galaxy  In the Star Wars Expanded Universe  many dark side users are Dark Jedi rather than Sith  mainly because of the  Rule of Two   see Sith Origin   3  4  5  6  7  8  Theatrical films The film series began with Star Wars  released on May 25  1977  This was followed by two sequels  The Empire Strikes Back  released on May 21  1980  and Return of the Jedi  released on May 25  1983  The opening crawl of the sequels disclosed that they were numbered as  Episode V  and  Episode VI  respectively  though the films were generally advertised solely under their subtitles  Though the first film in the series was simply titled Star Wars  with its 1981 re release it had the subtitle Episode IV  A New Hope added to remain consistent with its sequel  and to establish it as the middle chapter of a continuing saga  9  In 1997  to correspond with the 20th anniversary of Star Wars  Lucas released  Special Editions  of the original trilogy to theaters  The re releases featured alterations to the original films  primarily motivated by the improvement of CGI and other special effects technologies  which allowed visuals that were not possible to achieve at the time of the original filmmaking  Lucas continued to make changes to the films for subsequent releases  such as the first ever DVD release of the original trilogy on September 21  2004 and the first ever Blu ray release of all six films on September 16  2011  10  More than two decades after the release of the original film  the series continued with the long awaited prequel trilogy  consisting of Episode I  The Phantom Menace  released on May 19  1999  Episode II  Attack of the Clones  released on May 16  2002  and Episode III  Revenge of the Sith  released on May 19  2005  11  On August 15  2008 Star Wars  The Clone Wars was released theatrically as a lead in to the weekly animated TV series of the same name  Plot overview The prequel trilogy follows the life of a young slave named Anakin Skywalker who is discovered by the Jedi Knight Qui Gon Jinn  who believes him to be the  Chosen One  foretold by Jedi prophecy to bring balance to the Force  The Jedi Council  led by Yoda  sense that Anakin s future is clouded by fear  but reluctantly allow Qui Gon s apprentice Obi Wan Kenobi to train Anakin after Qui Gon is killed by the Sith Lord Darth Maul  At the same time  the planet Naboo is under attack  and its ruler  Queen Padm  Amidala  seeks the assistance of the Jedi to repel the attack  The Sith Lord Darth Sidious secretly planned the attack to give his alter ego  Senator Palpatine  a pretense to overthrow the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic and take his place  4  The remainder of the prequel trilogy chronicles Anakin s gradual fall to the dark side of the Force as he fights in the Clone Wars  which Palpatine secretly engineers in order to destroy the Republic and lure Anakin into his service  5  Anakin and Padm  fall in love and secretly wed  and eventually Padm  becomes pregnant  Anakin has a prophetic vision of Padm  dying in childbirth  and Palpatine convinces him that the dark side holds the power to save her life  desperate  Anakin submits to the dark side and takes the Sith name Darth Vader  While Palpatine re organizes the Republic into the tyrannical Galactic Empire appointing himself Emperor for life Vader participates in the extermination of the Jedi Order  culminating in a lightsaber battle between himself and Obi Wan  6  Obi Wan ultimately defeats his former apprentice and friend  severing his limbs and leaving him for dead beside a lava flow  However  Palpatine arrives shortly afterward and saves Vader  putting him into a black  mechanical suit of armor that keeps him alive  At the same time  Padm  dies while giving birth to twins Luke and Leia  The twins are hidden from Vader and are not told who their real parents are  6  Tatooine has two suns  as it is in a binary star system  This shot from A New Hope remains one of the most famous scenes of the entire saga  12  The original trilogy begins 19 years later as Vader nears completion of the massive Death Star space station  which will allow the Empire to crush the Rebel Alliance  which has formed to combat Palpatine s tyranny  Vader captures Princess Leia Organa  who has stolen the plans to the Death Star and hidden them in the astromech droid R2 D2  R2 D2  along with his counterpart C 3PO  escapes to the planet Tatooine  There  the droids are purchased by Luke Skywalker and his step uncle and aunt  While Luke is cleaning R2 D2  he accidentally triggers a message put into the droid by Leia  who asks for assistance from Obi Wan  Luke later assists the droids in finding the Jedi Knight  who is now passing as an old hermit under the alias Ben Kenobi  When Luke asks about his father  Obi Wan tells him that Anakin was a great Jedi who was betrayed and murdered by Vader  13  Obi Wan and Luke hire the smuggler Han Solo and his Wookiee co pilot Chewbacca to take them to Alderaan  Leia s home world  which they eventually find has been destroyed by the Death Star  Once onboard the space station  Obi Wan allows himself to be killed during a lightsaber rematch with Vader  his sacrifice allows the group to escape with the plans that help the rebels destroy the Death Star  Luke himself fires the shot that destroys the deadly space station  3  Three years later  Luke travels to find Yoda and start his Jedi training  but is interrupted when Vader lures him into a trap by capturing Han and the others  During a fierce lightsaber duel  Vader reveals that he is Luke s father and attempts to turn him to the dark side  7  Luke escapes  and  after rescuing Han from the gangster Jabba the Hutt a year later  returns to his training with Yoda  who by this time is on his deathbed  Before he passes away  Yoda confirms that Vader is Luke s father  moments later  Obi Wan s spirit tells Luke that he must face his father before he can become a Jedi  and that Leia is his twin sister  As the Rebels attack the second Death Star  Luke confronts Vader as Palpatine watches  both Sith Lords intend to turn Luke to the dark side and take him as their apprentice  8  During the subsequent

 witches  and princesses that are related to archetypes of the fantasy genre  15  The Star Wars world  unlike fantasy and science fiction films that featured sleek and futuristic settings  was portrayed as dirty and grimy  Lucas  vision of a  used future  was further popularized in the science fiction horror films Alien  16  which was set on a dirty space freighter  Mad Max 2  which is set in a post apocalyptic desert  and Blade Runner  which is set in a crumbling  dirty city of the future  Lucas made a conscious effort to parallel scenes and dialogue between films  and especially to parallel the journeys of Luke Skywalker with that of his father Anakin when making the prequels  4  Technical information All six films of the Star Wars series were shot in an aspect ratio of 2 40 1  The original trilogy was shot with anamorphic lenses  Episodes IV and V were shot in Panavision  while Episode VI was shot in Joe Dunton Camera  JDC  scope  Episode I was shot with Hawk anamorphic lenses on Arriflex cameras  and Episodes II and III were shot with Sony s CineAlta high definition digital cameras  17  Lucas hired Ben Burtt to oversee the sound effects on A New Hope  Burtt s accomplishment was such that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented him with a Special Achievement Award because it had no award at the time for the work he had done  18  Lucasfilm developed the THX sound reproduction standard for Return of the Jedi  19 John Williams composed the scores for all six films  Lucas  design for Star Wars involved a grand musical sound  with leitmotifs for different characters and important concepts  Williams  Star Wars title theme has become one of the most famous and well known musical compositions in modern music history  20  The technical lightsaber choreography for the original trilogy was developed by Hollywood sword master Bob Anderson  Anderson trained actor Mark Hamill  Luke Skywalker  and performed all the sword stunts as Darth Vader during the lightsaber duels in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi  wearing Vader s costume  Anderson s role in the original Star Wars trilogy was highlighted in the film Reclaiming the Blade  where he shares his experiences as the fight choreographer developing the lightsaber techniques for the movies  21  Production history Original trilogy  Original trilogy  redirects here  For the video game  see Lego Star Wars II  The Original Trilogy  George Lucas  the creator of Star Wars In 1971  Universal Studios agreed to make American Graffiti and Star Wars in a two picture contract  although Star Wars was later rejected in its early concept stages  American Graffiti was completed in 1973 and  a few months later  Lucas wrote a short summary called  The Journal of the Whills   which told the tale of the training of apprentice C J  Thorpe as a  Jedi Bendu  space commando by the legendary Mace Windy  22  Frustrated that his story was too difficult to understand  Lucas then wrote a 13 page treatment called The Star Wars  which was a loose remake of Akira Kurosawa s The Hidden Fortress  23  By 1974  he had expanded the treatment into a rough draft screenplay  adding elements such as the Sith  the Death Star  and a protagonist named Annikin Starkiller  For the second draft  Lucas made heavy simplifications  and introduced the young hero on a farm as Luke Skywalker  Anakin became Luke s father  a wise Jedi knight   The Force  was also introduced as a supernatural power  The next draft removed the father character and replaced him with a substitute named Ben Kenobi  and in 1976 a fourth draft had been prepared for principal photography  The film was titled Adventures of Luke Starkiller  as taken from the Journal of the Whills  Saga I  The Star Wars  During production  Lucas changed Luke s name to Skywalker and altered the title to simply The Star Wars and finally Star Wars  24  At that point  Lucas was not expecting the film to become part of a series  The fourth draft of the script underwent subtle changes that made it more satisfying as a self contained film  ending with the destruction of the Empire itself by way of destroying the Death Star  However  Lucas had previously conceived of the film as the first in a series of adventures  Later  he realized the film would not in fact be the first in the sequence  but a film in the second trilogy in the saga  This is stated explicitly in George Lucas  preface to the 1994 reissue of Splinter of the Mind s Eye  It wasn t long after I began writing Star Wars that I realized the story was more than a single film could hold  As the saga of the Skywalkers and Jedi Knights unfolded  I began to see it as a tale that could take at least nine films to tell three trilogies and I realized  in making my way through the back story and after story  that I was really setting out to write the middle story  The second draft contained a teaser for a never made sequel about  The Princess of Ondos   and by the time of the third draft some months later Lucas had negotiated a contract that gave him rights to make two sequels  Not long after  Lucas met with author Alan Dean Foster  and hired him to write these two sequels as novels  25  The intention was that if Star Wars were successful  Lucas could adapt the novels into screenplays  26  He had also by that point developed an elaborate backstory to aid his writing process  27  When Star Wars proved successful  Lucas decided to use the film as the basis for an elaborate serial  although at one point he considered walking away from the series altogether  28  However  Lucas wanted to create an independent filmmaking center what would become Skywalker Ranch and saw an opportunity to use the series as a financing agent  29  Alan Dean Foster had already begun writing the first sequel novel  but Lucas decided to abandon his plan to adapt Foster s work  the book was released as Splinter of the Mind s Eye the following year  At first Lucas envisioned a series of films with no set number of entries  like the James Bond series  In an interview with Rolling Stone in August 1977  he said that he wanted his friends to each take a turn at directing the films and giving unique interpretations on the series  He also said that the backstory in which Darth Vader turns to the dark side  kills Luke s father and fights Ben Kenobi on a volcano as the Galactic Republic falls would make an excellent sequel  Later that year  Lucas hired science fiction author Leigh Brackett to write Star Wars II with him  They held story conferences and  by late November 1977  Lucas had produced a handwritten treatment called The Empire Strikes Back  The treatment is very similar to the final film  except that Darth Vader does not reveal he is Luke s father  In the first draft that Brackett would write from this  Luke s father appears as a ghost to instruct Luke  30  Brackett finished her first draft in early 1978  Lucas has said he was disappointed with it  but before he could discuss it with her  she died of cancer  31  With no writer available  Lucas had to write his next draft himself  It was this draft in which Lucas first made use of the  Episode  numbering for the films  Empire Strikes Back was listed as Episode II  32  As Michael Kaminski argues in The Secret History of Star Wars  the disappointment with the first draft probably made Lucas consider different directions in which to take the story  33  He made use of a new plot twist  Darth Vader claims to be Luke s father  According to Lucas  he found this draft enjoyable to write  as opposed to the yearlong struggles writing the first film  and quickly wrote two more drafts  34  both in April 1978  He also took the script to a darker extreme by having Han Solo imprisoned in carbonite and left in limbo  7  This new story point of Darth Vader being Luke s father had drastic effects on the series  Michael Kaminski argues in his book that it is unlikely that the plot point had ever seriously been considered or even conceived of before 1978  and that the first film was clearly operating under an alternate storyline where Vader was separate from Luke s father  35  there is not a single reference to this plot point before 1978  After writing the second and third drafts of Empire Strikes Back in which the point was introduced  Lucas reviewed the new backstory he had created  Anakin Skywalker was Ben Kenobi s brilliant student and had a child named Luke  but was swayed to the dark side by Emperor Palpatine  who became a Sith and not simply a politician   Anakin battled Ben Kenobi on the site of a volcano and was wounded  but then resurrected as Darth Vader  Meanwhile Kenobi hid Luke on Tatooine while the Republic became the Empire and Vader systematically hunted down and killed the Jedi  36  Image of the original trilogy DVD collection on the top and the prequel trilogy DVD collection on the bottom  With this new backstory in place  Lucas decided that the series would be a trilogy  changing Empire Strikes Back from Episode II to Episode V in the next draft  34 Lawrence Kasdan  who had just completed writing Raiders of the Lost Ark  was then hired to write the next drafts  and was given additional input from director Irvin Kershner  Kasdan  Kershner  and producer Gary Kurtz saw the film as a more serious and adult film  which was helped by the new  darker storyline  and developed the series from the light adventure roots of the first film  37  By the time he began writing Episode VI in 1981  then titled Revenge of the Jedi   much had changed  Making Empire Strikes Back was stressful and costly  and Lucas  personal life was disintegrating  Burned out and not wanting to make any more Star Wars films  he vowed that he was done with the series in a May 1983 interview with Time magazine  Lucas  1981 rough drafts had Darth Vader competing with the Emperor for possession of Luke and in the second script  the  revised rough draft   Vader became a sympathetic character  Lawrence Kasdan was hired to take over once again and  in these final drafts  Vader was explicitly redeemed and finally unmasked  This change in character would provide a springboard to the  Tragedy of Darth Vader  storyline that underlies the prequels  38  Prequel trilogy After losing much of his fortune in a divorce settlement in 1987  Lucas had no desire to return to Star Wars  and had unofficially canceled his sequel trilogy by the time of Return of the Jedi  39  Nevertheless  the prequels  which were quite developed at this point  continued to fascinate him  After Star Wars became popular once again  in the wake of Dark Horse s comic book line and Timothy Zahn s trilogy of novels  Lucas saw that there was still a large audience  His children were older  and with the explosion of CGI technology he was now considering returning to directing  40  By 1993 it was announced  in Variety among other sources  that he would be making the prequels  He began outlining the story  now indicating the series would be a tragic one examining Anakin Skywalker s fall to the dark side  Lucas also began to change how the prequels would exist relative to the originals  at first they were supposed to be a  filling in  of history tangential to the originals  but now he saw that they could form the beginning of one long story that started with Anakin s childhood and ended with his death  This was the final step towards turning the film series into a  Saga   41  In 1994  Lucas began writing the first screenplay titled Episode I  The Beginning  Following the release of that film  Lucas announced that he would also be directing the next two  and began working on Episode II at that time  42  The first draft of Episode II was completed just weeks before principal photography  and Lucas hired Jonathan Hales  a writer from The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles  to polish it  43  Unsure of a title  Lucas had jokingly called the film  Jar Jar s Great Adventure   44  In writing The Empire Strikes Back  Lucas initially decided that Lando Calrissian was a clone and came from a planet of clones which caused the  Clone Wars  mentioned by Obi Wan Kenobi in A New Hope  45  46  he later came up with an alternate concept of an army of clone shocktroopers from a remote planet which attacked the Republic and were repelled by the Jedi  47  The basic elements of that backstory became the plot basis for Episode II  with the new wrinkle added that Palpatine secretly orchestrated the crisis  5  Lucas began working on Episode III before Attack of the Clones was released  offering concept artists that the film would open with a montage of seven Clone War battles  48  As he reviewed the storyline that summer  however  he says he radically re organized the plot  49  Michael Kaminski  in The Secret History of Star Wars  offers evidence that issues in Anakin s fall to the dark side prompted Lucas to make massive story changes  first revising the opening sequence to have Palpatine kidnapped and his apprentice  Count Dooku  murdered by Anakin as the first act in the latter s turn towards the dark side  50  After principal photography was complete in 2003  Lucas made even more massive changes in Anakin s character  re writing his entire turn to the dark side  he would now turn primarily in a quest to save Padm  s life  rather than the previous version in which that reason was one of several  including that he genuinely believed that the Jedi were evil and plotting to take over the Republic  This fundamental re write was accomplished both through editing the principal footage  and new and revised scenes filmed during pick ups in 2004  51  Lucas often exaggerated the amount of material he wrote for the series  much of it stemmed from the post 1978 period when the series grew into a phenomenon  Michael Kaminski explained that these exaggerations were both a publicity and security measure  Kaminski rationalized that since the series  story radically changed throughout the years  it was always Lucas  intention to change the original story retroactively because audiences would only view the material from his perspective  6  52  When congratulating the producers of the TV series Lost in 2010  Lucas himself jokingly admitted   when Star Wars first came out  I didn t know where it was going either  The trick is to pretend you ve planned the whole thing out in advance  Throw in some father issues and references to other stories   let s call them homages   and you ve got a series   53  Sequel trilogy Main article  Star Wars sequel trilogy The sequel trilogy was a reportedly planned trilogy of films  Episodes VII  VIII and IX  by Lucasfilm as a sequel to the original Star Wars trilogy  Episodes IV  V and VI  released between 1977 and 1983  54  While the similarly discussed Star Wars prequel trilogy  Episodes I  II and III  was ultimately released between 1999 and 2005  Lucasfilm and George Lucas have for many years denied plans of making a sequel trilogy  insisting that Star Wars is meant to be a six part series  55  56  In May 2008  speaking about the upcoming Star Wars  The Clone Wars  Lucas maintained his status on the sequel trilogy   I get asked all the time   What happens after Return of the Jedi    and there really is no answer for that  The movies were the story of Anakin Skywalker and Luke Skywalker  and when Luke saves the galaxy and redeems his father  that s where that story ends   57  In January 2012  Lucas announced that he would step away from blockbuster films and instead produce smaller art house films  In an interview regarding whether or not the scrutiny he received from the prequel trilogy and the alterations made on the original trilogy were a factor on his retirement  Lucas stated   Why would I make any more     when everybody yells at you all the time and says what a terrible person you are   58  Future releases At a ShoWest convention in 2005  Lucas demonstrated new technology and stated that he planned to release the six films in a new 3 D film format  beginning with A New Hope in 2007  59  However  by January 2007  Lucasfilm stated on StarWars com that  there are no definitive plans or dates for releasing the Star Wars saga in 3 D   At Celebration Europe in July 2007  Rick McCallum confirmed that Lucasfilm is  planning to take all six films and turn them into 3 D   but they are  waiting for the companies out there that are developing this technology to bring it down to a cost level that makes it worthwhile for everybody   60  In July 2008  Jeffrey Katzenberg  the CEO of DreamWorks Animation  revealed that Lucas plans to redo all six of the movies in 3D  61  In late September 2010  it was announced that The Phantom Menace would be theatrically re released in 3 D on February 10  2012  62  63  All six films would be re released in order  with the 3 D conversion process taking at least a year to complete per film  64  Box office performance Film Release date Box office revenue Box office ranking United States Non US Worldwide Adjusted for inflation  US  All

works Main article  Star Wars fan films The Star Wars saga has inspired many fans to create their own non canon material set in the Star Wars galaxy  In recent years  this has ranged from writing fan fiction to creating fan films  In 2002  Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards  officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre  Because of concerns over potential copyright and trademark issues  however  the contest was initially open only to parodies  mockumentaries  and documentaries  Fan fiction films set in the Star Wars universe were originally ineligible  but in 2007 Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in universe fiction entries  113  While many fan films have used elements from the licensed Expanded Universe to tell their story  they are not considered an official part of the Star Wars canon  However  the lead character from the Pink Five series was incorporated into Timothy Zahn s 2007 novel Allegiance  marking the first time a fan created Star Wars character has ever crossed into the official canon  114  Lucasfilm  for the most part  has allowed but not endorsed the creation of these derivative fan fiction works  so long as no such work attempts to make a profit from or tarnish the Star Wars franchise in any way  115  Attractions The original ride at Disneyland in 1996 In 1986  George Lucas established a partnership with the Walt Disney Company and its Walt Disney Imagineering division to create Star Tours  an attraction that opened at Disneyland in 1987  The attraction also had subsequent incarnations at other Disney

parodied in numerous films and television  Notable film parodies of Star Wars include Hardware Wars  a 13 minute 1977 spoof which Lucas has called his favorite Star Wars parody  and Spaceballs  a feature film by Mel Brooks which featured effects done by Lucas  Industrial Light  amp  Magic  116  117  Lucasfilm itself made two mockumentaries  Return of the Ewok  1982   about Warwick Davis  who portrayed Wicket W  Warrick in Return of the Jedi  and R2 D2  Beneath the Dome  2002   which depicts R2 D2 s  life story   118  119  There have also been many songs based on  and in  the Star Wars universe   Weird Al  Yankovic recorded two parodies   Yoda   a parody of  Lola  by The Kinks  and  The Saga Begins   a parody of Don McLean s song  American Pie  that retells of The Phantom Menace from Obi Wan Kenobi s perspective  120  In television  the creators of the Robot Chicken series have produced three television specials satirizing the Star Wars films   Robot Chicken  Star Wars    Episode II   and  III    and are developing an animated comedy series based in the Star Wars universe  121  The creators of the Family Guy series have also produced three Star Wars specials titled  Blue Harvest    Something  Something  Something  Dark Side   and  It s a Trap    122  When Ronald Reagan proposed the Strategic Defense Initiative  SDI   a system of lasers and missiles meant to intercept incoming ICBMs  the plan was quickly labeled  Star Wars   implying that it was science fiction and linking it to Ronald Reagan s acting career  According to Frances FitzGerald  Reagan was annoyed by this  but Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle told colleagues that he  thought the name was not so bad      Why not   he said   It s a good movie  Besides  the good guys won    123  This gained further resonance when Reagan described the Soviet Union as an  evil empire   See also Architecture of Star Wars Empire of Dreams  The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy List of Star Wars
