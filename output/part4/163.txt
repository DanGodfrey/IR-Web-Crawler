similar to that of present day Poland  The Kingdom of Poland was formed in 1025  and in 1569 it cemented a long association with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by signing the Union of Lublin  forming the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth  The Commonwealth ceased to exist in 1795 as the Polish lands were partitioned among the Kingdom of Prussia  the Russian Empire  and Austria  Poland regained its independence as the Second Polish Republic in 1918  Two decades later  in September 1939  World War II started with the Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union invasion of Poland  Over six million Polish citizens died in the war  Poland reemerged several years later within the Soviet sphere of influence as the People s Republic in existence until 1989  During the Revolutions of 1989  45 year long communist rule was overthrown and the democratic rule was re established  That gave foundations to modern Poland  constitutionally known as the  Third Polish Republic   Despite the vast destruction the country experienced in World War II  Poland managed to preserve much of its cultural wealth  There are currently 14 heritage sites inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list in Poland  7  Since

ethnonyms for the Poles 10  include endonyms  the way Polish people refer to themselves and their country  and exonyms  the way other peoples refer to the Poles and their country   Endonyms and most exonyms for Poles and Poland derive from the name of the West Slavic tribe of the Polans  Polanie   The origin of the name Polanie itself is uncertain  It may derive from such Polish words as pole  field   11  The early tribal inhabitants denominated it from the nature of the country  Lowlands and low hills predominate throughout the vast region from the Baltic shores to the foothills of the

Historians have postulated that throughout Late Antiquity  many distinct ethnic groups populated the regions of what is now known as Poland  The ethnicity and linguistic affiliation of these groups have been hotly debated  the time and route of the original settlement of Slavic peoples in these regions have been the particular subjects of much controversy  The most famous archeological find from the prehistory and protohistory of Poland is the Biskupin fortified settlement  now reconstructed as a museum   dating from the Lusatian culture of the early Iron Age  around 700 BC  Before adopting Christianity in 960 AD  the people of Poland believed in Svetovid  the Slavic god of war  fertility  and abundance  Many other Slavic nations had the same belief  Piast dynasty Main article  History of Poland  966 1385  Baptism of Poland in 966 Poland began to form into a recognizable unitary and territorial entity around the middle of the 10th century under the Piast dynasty  Poland s first historically documented ruler  Mieszko I  was baptized in 966  adopting Catholic Christianity as the nation s new official religion  to which the bulk of the population converted in the course of the next centuries  Played a large role in the Congress of Gniezno  In the 12th century  Poland fragmented into several smaller duchies when Boles aw divided the nation amongst his sons  In 1226 Konrad I of Masovia  one of the regional Piast dukes  invited the Teutonic Knights to help him fight the Baltic Prussian pagans  a decision which would ultimately lead to centuries of Poland s warfare with the Knights  In the middle of 13th century Poland were almost united by Silesian branch of Piast dynasty  Henry I the Bearded and Henry II the Pious   when the country were devasteted by Mongols  who defeated and killed the latter in the Battle of Legnica  In 1320  after a number of earlier unsuccessful attempts by regional rulers at uniting the Polish dukedoms  W adys aw I consolidated his power  took the throne and became the first King of a reunified Poland  His son  Casimir III  is remembered as one of the greatest Polish kings  who were widely recognised  protector of trade and extended his Kingdom by 2 5 hold from initial size  Casimir is also known for extending royal protection to Jews and providing the original impetus for the establishment of Poland s first university  The Golden Liberty of the nobles began to develop under Casimir s rule  when in return for their military support  the king made serious concessions to the aristocrats  finally establishing their status as superior to that of the townsmen  and aiding their rise to power  When Casimir died in 1370 he left no legitimate male heir and  considering his other male descendants either too young or unsuitable  was laid to rest as the last of the nation s Piast rulers  Poland was also a centre of migration of peoples  The Germans settled in the towns  the Jewish community began to settle and flourish in Poland during this era  see History of the Jews in Poland   the same applies in smaller number to Armenians  The Black Death which affected most parts of Europe from 1347 to 1351 affected Poland to lesser extend  12  Jagiellon dynasty Main article  History of Poland  1385 1569  Nicolaus Copernicus  talking with God   who reveals to him the truth about the solar system  Painting by Jan Matejko  The rule of the Jagiellon dynasty  spanned the late Middle Ages and early Modern Era of Polish history  Beginning with the Lithuanian Grand Duke Jogaila  W adys aw II Jagie  o   the Jagiellon dynasty  1386 1572  formed the Polish Lithuanian union  The partnership brought vast Lithuania controlled Rus  areas into Poland s sphere of influence and proved beneficial for the Poles and Lithuanians  who coexisted and cooperated in one of the largest political entities in Europe for the next four centuries  In the Baltic Sea region Poland s struggle with the Teutonic Knights continued and included the Battle of Grunwald  1410   where a Polish Lithuanian army inflicted a decisive defeat on the Teutonic Knights  both countries  main adversary  allowing Poland s and Lithuania s territorial expansion into the far north region of Livonia  13  In 1466  after the Thirteen Years  War  King Casimir IV Jagiellon gave royal consent to the milestone Peace of Thorn  which created the future Duchy of Prussia  a Polish vassal  The Jagiellons at one point also established dynastic control over the kingdoms of Bohemia  1471 onwards  and Hungary  14  15  In the south Poland confronted the Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Tatars  by whom they were attacked on 75 separate occasions between 1474 and 1569   16  and in the east helped Lithuania fight the Grand Duchy of Moscow  Some historians estimate that Crimean Tatar slave raiding cost Poland one million of its population from 1494 to 1694  17  Wawel  the seat of Polish kings  Krak w was the nation s capital from 1038 until the move to Warsaw in 1596 Poland was developing as a feudal state  with a predominantly agricultural economy and an increasingly powerful landed nobility  The Nihil novi act adopted by the Polish Sejm  parliament  in 1505  transferred most of the legislative power from the monarch to the Sejm  an event which marked the beginning of the period known as  Golden Liberty   when the state was ruled by the  free and equal  Polish nobility  Protestant Reformation movements made deep inroads into Polish Christianity  which resulted in the establishment of policies promoting religious tolerance  unique in Europe at that time  It is believed that this tolerance allowed the country to avoid the religious turmoil that spread over Europe during the late Middle Ages  The European Renaissance evoked in late Jagiellon Poland  kings Sigismund I the Old and Sigismund II Augustus  a sense of urgency in the need to promote a cultural awakening  and resultantly during this period Polish culture and the nation s economy flourished  In 1543 the Pole  Nicolaus Copernicus  an astronomer from Toru   published his epochal works  De revolutionibus orbium coelestium  On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres   and thus became the first proponent of a predictive mathematical model confirming heliocentric theory which ultimately became the accepted basic model for the practice of modern astronomy  Another major figure associated with the era is classicist poet Jan Kochanowski  18  Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth Main article  History of Poland  1569 1795  The Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth at its greatest extent  after the Truce of Deulino  Dywilino  of 1619 The 1569 Union of Lublin established the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth  a more closely unified federal state with an elective monarchy  but which was governed largely by the nobility  through a system of local assemblies with a central parliament  The establishment of the Commonwealth coincided with a period of great stability and prosperity in Poland  with the union soon thereafter becoming a great European power and a major cultural entity  occupying approximately one million square kilometres of central Europe  as well as an agent for the of the  Western culture  through Polonization in modern day Ukraine  Belarus and Western Russia  Poland Lithuania suffered from a number of dynastic crises during the reigns of the Vasa kings Sigismund III and W adys aw IV and found itself engaged in a major conflicts with Russia  Sweden and the Ottoman Empire  as well as a series of minor Cossack uprisings  19  A stylised depiction of King John III Sobieski  allied commander in chief and victor at the Battle of Vienna From the middle of the 17th century  the nobles  democracy  suffering from internal disorder  gradually declined  thus leaving the once powerful Commonwealth extremely vulnerable to foreign intervention  From 1648  the Cossack Khmelnytsky Uprising engulfed the south and east eventually leaving Ukraine divided  with the eastern part  lost by the Commonwealth  becoming a dependency of the Tsardom of Russia  This was soon followed by the  Deluge   a Swedish invasion  which raged through the Polish heartlands and caused unprecedented damage to Poland s population  culture and infrastructure  Famines and epidemics followed hostilities  and the population dropped from roughly 11 to 7 million  20  However  under John III Sobieski the Commonwealth s military prowess was re established  and in 1683 Polish forces played a major part in relieving Vienna of a major Turkish siege which was being conducted by Kara Mustafa in hope of eventually marching his troops further into Europe to spread Islam  Unfortunately  Sobieski s reign was to mark the end of the nation s golden era  and soon  finding itself subjected to almost constant warfare and suffering enormous population losses as well as massive damage to its economy  the Commonwealth fell into decline  The government became ineffective as a result of large scale internal conflicts  e g  Lubomirski s Rokosz against John II Casimir and rebellious confederations  and corrupted legislative processes  The nobility fell under the control of a handful of magnates  and this  compounded with two relatively weak kings of the Saxon Wettin dynasty  Augustus II and Augustus III  as well as the rise of Russia and Prussia after the Great Northern War only served to worsen the Commonwealth s plight  Despite this The Commonwealth Saxony personal union gave rise to the emergence of the Commonwealth s first reform movement  and laid the foundations for the Polish Enlightenment  21  Stanis aw August Poniatowski  the last King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania acceded to the throne in 1764  reigning until his abdication on 25 November 1795 During the later part of the 18th century  the Commonwealth made attempts to implement fundamental internal reforms  with the second half of the century bringing a much improved economy  significant population growth and far reaching progress in the areas of education  intellectual life  art  and especially toward the end of the period  evolution of the social and political system  The most populous capital city of Warsaw replaced Gda sk  Danzig  as the leading centre of commerce  and the role of the more prosperous townsfolk soon increased  The royal election of 1764 resulted in the elevation of Stanis aw August Poniatowski  a refined and worldly aristocrat connected to a major magnate faction  to the monarchy  However  a one time lover of Empress Catherine II of Russia  the new King spent much of his reign torn between his desire to implement reforms necessary to save his nation  and his perceived necessity to remain in a relationship with his Russian sponsor  This ultimately led to the formation of the 1768 Bar Confederation  a szlachta rebellion directed against Russia and the Polish king which fought to preserve Poland s independence and the szlachta s traditional privileges  Unfortunately  attempts at reform provoked the union s neighbours  and in 1772 the First Partition of the Commonwealth by Russia  Austria and Prussia took place  an act which the  Partition Sejm   under considerable duress  eventually  ratified  fait accompli  22  Disregarding this loss  in 1773 the king established the Commission of National Education  the first government education authority in Europe  The long lasting Great Sejm convened by Stanis aw August in 1788 successfully adopted the May 3 Constitution  the first set of modern supreme national laws in Europe  However  this document  accused by detractors of harbouring revolutionary sympathies  soon generated strong opposition from the Commonwealth s nobles and conservatives as well as from Catherine II  who  determined to prevent the rebirth of a strong Commonwealth set about planning the final dismemberment of the Polish Lithuanian state  Russia was greatly aided in achieving its goal when the Targowica Confederation  an organisation of Polish nobles  appealed to the Empress for help  and in May 1792 Russian forces crossed the Commonwealth s frontier  thus beginning the Polish Russian War  The defensive war fought by the Poles and Lithuanians ended prematurely when the King  convinced of the futility of resistance  capitulated and joined the Targowica Confederation  The Confederation then took over the government  but Russia and Prussia  fearing the mere existence of a Polish state  arranged for  and subsequently in 1793  executed the Second Partition of the Commonwealth  which left the country deprived of so much territory that it was practically incapable of independent existence  Eventually  in 1795  following the failed Ko ciuszko Uprising  the Commonwealth was partitioned one last time by all three of its more powerful neighbours  and with this  effectively ceased to exist  23  The Age of Partitions Main article  History of Poland  1795 1918  Tadeusz Ko ciuszko takes the oath to the King on the Rynek in Krak w  1794 Poles rebelled several times against the partitioners  particularly near the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century  One of the most famous and successful attempts at securing renewed Polish independence took place in 1794  during the Ko ciuszko Uprising  at the Rac awice where Tadeusz Kosciuszko  a popular and distinguished general who had served under Washington in America  led peasants and some Polish regulars into battle against numerically superior Russian forces  In 1807  Napoleon I of France recreated a Polish state  the Duchy of Warsaw  but after the Napoleonic Wars  Poland was again divided by the victorious Allies at the Congress of Vienna of 1815  The eastern part was ruled by the Russian tsar as a Congress Kingdom which possessed a very liberal constitution  However  the tsars soon reduced Polish freedoms  and Russia annexed the country in virtually all but name  Thus in the latter half of the 19th century  only Austrian ruled Galicia  and particularly the Free City of Krak w  created good environment for free Polish cultural life to flourish  Throughout the period of the partitions  political and cultural repression of the Polish nation led to the organisation of a number of uprisings against the authorities of the occupying Russian  Prussian and Austrian governments  Notable amongst these are the November Uprising of 1830 and January Uprising of 1863  both of which were attempts to free Poland from the rule of tsarist Russia  The November uprising began on 29 November 1830 in Warsaw when  led by Lieutenant Piotr Wysocki  young non commissioned officers at the Imperial Russian Army s military academy in that city revolted  They were soon joined by large segments of Polish society  and together forced Warsaw s Russian garrison to withdraw north of the city  Polish insurgents and Russian cuirassiers clash on a bridge in Warsaw s  azienki Park during the November Uprising  Painting by Wojciech Kossak  1898 Over the course of the next seven months  Polish forces successfully defeated the Russian armies of Field Marshal Hans Karl von Diebitsch and a number of other Russian commanders  however  finding themselves in a position unsupported by any other foreign powers  save distant France and the newborn United States  and with Prussia and Austria refusing to allow the import of military supplies through their territories  the Poles accepted that the uprising was doomed to failure  Upon the surrender of Warsaw to General Ivan Paskievich  many Polish troops  feeling they could not go on  withdrew into Germany and there laid down their arms  Poles would have to wait another 32 years for another opportunity to free their homeland  When in January 1863 a new Polish uprising against Russian rule began  it did so as a spontaneous protest by young Poles against conscription into the Imperial Russian Army  However  the insurrectionists  despite being joined by high ranking Polish Lithuanian officers and numerous politicians were still severely outnumbered and lacking in foreign support  They were forced to resort to guerrilla warfare tactics and ultimately failed to win any major military victories  Afterwards no major uprising was witnessed in the Russian controlled Congress Poland and Poles resorted instead to fostering economic and cultural self improvement  Despite the political unrest experienced during the partitions  Poland did benefit from large scale industrialisation and modernisation programs  instituted by the occupying powers  which helped it develop into a more economically coherent and viable entity  This was particularly true in the Greater Poland  Pomerania and Warmia annexed by Prussia  later becoming a part of the German Empire   an area which eventually  thanks largely to the Greater Poland Uprising  was reconstituted as a part of the Second Polish Republic and became one of its most productive regions  Reconstitution of Poland Main article  History of Poland  1918 1939  Chief of State Marshal J zef Pi sudski During World War I  all the Allies agreed on the reconstitution of Poland that United States President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed in Point 13 of his Fourteen Points  A total of 2 million Polish troops fought with the armies of the three occupying powers  and 450 000 died  24  Shortly after the armistice with Germany in November 1918  Poland regained its independence as the Second Polish Republic  II Rzeczpospolita Polska   It reaffirmed its independence after a series of military conflicts  the most notable being the Polish Soviet War  1919 1921  when Poland inflicted a crushing defeat on the Red Army at the Battle of Warsaw  an event which is considered to have ultimately halted the advance of Communism into Europe and forced Lenin to rethink his objective of achieving global socialism  Nowadays the event is often referred to as the  Miracle at the Vistula   25  Poland between 1922 and 1938 During this period  Poland successfully managed to fuse the territories of the three former partitioning powers into a cohesive nation state  Railways were restructured to direct traffic towards Warsaw instead of the former imperial capitals  a new network of national roads was gradually built up and a major seaport was opened on the Baltic Coast  so as to allow Polish exports and imports to bypass the politically charged Free City of Danzig  The inter war period heralded in a new era of Polish politics  Whilst Polish political activists had faced heavy censorship in the decades up until the First World War  the country now found itself trying to establish a new political tradition  For this reason  many exiled Polish activists  such as Jan Paderewski  who would later become Prime Minister  returned home to help  a great number of them then went on to take key positions in the newly formed political and governmental structures  Tragedy struck in 1922 when Gabriel Narutowicz  inaugural holder of the Presidency  was assassinated at the Zach ta Gallery in Warsaw by painter and right wing nationalist Eligiusz Niewiadomski  26  The 1926 May Coup of J zef Pi sudski turned rule of the Second Polish Republic over to the Sanacja movement  By the 1930s Poland had become increasingly authoritarian  a number of  undesirable  political parties  such as the Polish Communists  had been banned and following Pi sudski s death  the regime  unable to appoint a new leader  began to show its inherent internal weaknesses and unwillingness to cooperate in any way with other political parties  World War II Main articles  History of Poland  1939 1945   Polish contribution to World War II  and World War II crimes in Poland The Sanacja movement controlled Poland until the start of World War II in 1939  when Nazi Germany invaded on 1 September and the Soviet invasion of Poland followed by breaking the Soviet Polish Non Aggression Pact on 17 September  Warsaw capitulated on 28 September 1939  As agreed in the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact  Poland was split into two zones  one occupied by Nazi Germany while the Kresy  or Borderlands  fell under the control of the Soviet Union  By 1941 the Soviets had moved hundreds of thousands of Poles into labor camps all over the Soviet Union  and the Soviet secret police  NKVD  had executed thousands of Polish prisoners of war  27  Polish forces stationed abroad constituted the fourth largest allied force of the war Poland made the fourth largest troop contribution to the Allied war effort  after the Soviets  the British and the Americans  a  Polish troops fought under the command of both the Polish Government in Exile in the theatre of war west of Germany and under Soviet leadership in the theatre of war east of Germany  The Polish expeditionary corps  which was controlled by the exiled pre war government based in London  played an important role in the Italian and North African Campaigns  28  29  They are particularly well remembered for their conduct at the Battle of Monte Cassino  a conflict which culminated in the raising of a Polish flag over the ruins of the mountain top abbey by the 12th Podolian Uhlans  The Polish forces in the theatre of war east of Germany were commanded by Lieutenant General W adys aw Anders who had received his command from Prime Minister of the exiled government W adys aw Sikorski  On the east of Germany  the Soviet backed Polish 1st Army distinguished itself in the battles for Berlin and Warsaw  although its actions in support of the latter have often been criticised  At the end of World War II  the gray territories were transferred from Poland to the Soviet Union  and the pink territories from Germany to Poland Polish servicemen were also active in the theatres of naval and air warfare  during the Battle of Britain Polish squadrons such as the No  303  Ko ciuszko  fighter squadron 30  achieved great success  and by the end of the war the exiled Polish Air Forces could claim 769 confirmed kills  Meanwhile  the navy was active in the protection of convoys in the North Sea and Atlantic Ocean  31  In addition to the organised units of the 1st Army and the Forces in the Nazi occupied Europe  the domestic underground resistance movement  the Armia Krajowa  Home Army   fought to free Poland from German occupation and establish an independent Polish state  The wartime resistance movement in Poland was one of the three largest resistance movements of the entire war b  and encompassed a uniquely large range of clandestine activities  essentially functioning as an underground state complete with underground universities and courts  32  The resistance was however  largely loyal to the exiled government and generally resented the idea of a communist Poland  for this reason  on 1 August 1944 they initiated Operation Tempest and thus began the Warsaw Uprising  33  34  The objective of the uprising was to drive the German occupiers from the city and help with the larger fight against Germany and the Axis powers  however secondary motives for the uprising sought to see Warsaw liberated before the Soviets could reach the capital  so as to underscore Polish sovereignty by empowering the Polish Underground State before the Soviet backed Polish Committee of National Liberation could assume control  However  a lack of available allied military aid and Stalin s reluctance to allow the 1st Army to help their fellow countrymen take the city  ultimately led to the uprising s failure and subsequent planned destruction of the city  Grave of Polish fighter killed during the Warsaw Uprising  In the battle  which lasted 63 days  more than 200 000 people died  During the war  German forces  under direct order from Adolf Hitler  set up six major extermination camps  all of which were established on Polish territory  these included both the notorious Treblinka and Auschwitz camps  This allowed the Nazi Germans to transport the Jews living in the Third Reich outside of  German  territory  as well as import Jews and other  undesirables  from across occupied Europe to be  liquidated  in the concentration camps set up in the General Government  Other undesirables included Polish intelligentsia  Communists  Roma peoples and Soviet Prisoners of War  However  since millions of Jews lived in pre war Poland  Jewish victims make up the largest percentage of all victims of the Nazis  extermination program  It is estimated that around 90   or about 3 million members  of pre war Poland s Jewry were put to death by the Nazi Germans during the Second World War  Throughout the occupation  many members of the Armia Krajowa  supported by the Polish government in exile  and millions of ordinary Poles   at great risk to themselves and their families   engaged in rescuing Jews from the Nazi Germans  Grouped by nationality  Poles represent the largest number of people who rescued Jews during the Holocaust  35  36  To date  6 135 Poles have been awarded the title of Righteous among the Nations by the State of Israel   more than any other nation  35  Some estimates put the number of Poles involved in rescue at up to 3 million  and credit Poles with saving up to around 450 000 Jews from certain death  36  At the war s conclusion  Poland s territory was shifted westwards  pushing the Kresy in accordance with the Curzon Line  Meanwhile  the western border moved to the Oder Neisse line  As a result  Poland s territory was reduced by 20   or 77 500 square kilometres  29 900 sq mi   The shift forced the migration of millions of people  most of whom were Poles  Germans  Ukrainians  and Jews  37 Of all the countries involved in the war  Poland lost the highest percentage of its citizens  over 6 million perished   nearly one fifth of Poland s population   half of them Polish Jews  Over 90  of the death toll came through non military losses  Only in the 1970s did Poland again approach its prewar population level  38  An estimated 600 000 Soviet soldiers died in conquering Poland from German rule  39  Postwar communist Poland Main

the 1989 elections   The 4th of June  1989 marked a decisive victory for democracy in Poland and  ultimately  across  Central and  Eastern Europe    Angela Merkel 40  At the insistence of Joseph Stalin  the Yalta Conference sanctioned the formation of a new Polish provisional and pro Communist coalition government in Moscow  which ignored the Polish government in exile based in London  a move which angered many Poles who considered it a betrayal by the Allies  In 1944  Stalin had made guarantees to Churchill and Roosevelt that he would maintain Poland s sovereignty and allow democratic elections to take place  however  upon achieving victory in 1945  the occupying Soviet authorities organised an election which constituted nothing more than a sham and was ultimately used to claim the  legitimacy  of Soviet hegemony over Polish affairs  The Soviet Union instituted a new communist government in Poland  analogous to much of the rest of the Eastern Bloc  As elsewhere in Communist Europe the Soviet occupation of Poland met with armed resistance from the outset which continued into the fifties  Despite widespread objections  the new Polish government accepted the Soviet annexation of the pre war eastern regions of PolandKresy    41   in particular the cities of Wilno and Lw w  and agreed to the permanent garrisoning of Red Army units on Poland s territory  Military alignment within the Warsaw Pact throughout the Cold War came about as a direct result of this change in Poland s political culture and in the European scene came to characterise the fully fledged integration of Poland into the brotherhood of communist nations  The People s Republic of Poland  Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa  was officially proclaimed in 1952  In 1956  the r gime of W adys aw Gomu ka became temporarily more liberal  freeing many people from prison and expanding some personal freedoms  A similar situation repeated itself in the 1970s under Edward Gierek  but most of the time persecution of anti communist opposition groups persisted  Despite this  Poland was at the time considered to be one of the least repressive states of the Soviet Bloc  42  Labour turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union  Solidarity    Solidarno      which over time became a political force  Despite persecution and imposition of martial law in 1981  it eroded the dominance of the Communist Party and by 1989 had triumphed in Poland s first free and democratic parliamentary elections since the end of the Second World War  Lech Wa  sa  a Solidarity candidate  eventually won the presidency in 1990  The Solidarity movement heralded the collapse of communist regimes and parties across Europe  Present day Poland Main article  History of Poland  1989 present  Poland joined NATO in 1999 and since 2004 has been a member of the European Union  A shock therapy programme  initiated by Leszek Balcerowicz in the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its socialist style planned economy into a market economy  As with all other post communist countries  Poland suffered temporary slumps in social and economic standards  but it became the first post communist country to reach its pre 1989 GDP levels  which it achieved by 1995 largely thanks to its booming economy  43  44  Most visibly  there were numerous improvements in human rights  such as the freedom of speech  civil liberties  1st class  and political rights  1st class   according to Freedom House  In 1991  Poland became a member of the Visegr d Group and joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  NATO  alliance in 1999 along with the Czech Republic and Hungary  Poles then voted to join the European Union in a referendum in June 2003  with Poland becoming a full member on 1 May 2004  Subsequently Poland joined the Schengen Area in 2007  as a result of which  the country s borders with other member states of the European Union have been dismantled  allowing for full freedom of movement within most of the EU  45  In contrast to this  the section of Poland s eastern border now comprising the external EU border with Belarus  Russia and Ukraine  has become increasingly well protected  and has led in part to the coining of the phrase  Fortress Europe   in reference to the seeming  impossibility  of gaining entry to the EU for citizens of the former Soviet Union  On April 10  2010  the President of the Republic of Poland  Lech Kaczy ski  along with 89 other high ranking Polish officials died in a plane crash near Smolensk  Russia  The president s party were on their way to attend an annual service of commemoration for the victims of the Katy  massacre when the tragedy took place  Geography Main article  Geography of Poland Poland s topography Poland s territory extends across several geographical regions  between latitudes 49  and 55  N  and longitudes 14  and 25  E  In the north west is the Baltic seacoast  which extends from the Bay of Pomerania to the Gulf of Gda sk  This coast is marked by several spits  coastal lakes  former bays that have been cut off from the sea   and dunes  The largely straight coastline is indented by the Szczecin Lagoon  the Bay of Puck  and the Vistula Lagoon  The centre and parts of the north lie within the North European Plain  Rising gently above these lowlands is a geographical region comprising the four hilly districts of moraines and moraine dammed lakes formed during and after the Pleistocene ice age  These lake districts are the Pomeranian Lake District  the Greater Polish Lake District  the Kashubian Lake District  and the Masurian Lake District  The Masurian Lake District is the largest of the four and covers much of north eastern Poland  The lake districts form part of the Baltic Ridge  a series of moraine belts along the southern shore of the Baltic Sea  South of the Northern European Lowlands lie the regions of Silesia and Masovia  which are marked by broad ice age river valleys  Farther south lies the Polish mountain region  including the Sudetes  the Cracow Cz stochowa Upland  the  wi tokrzyskie Mountains  and the Carpathian Mountains  including the Beskids  The highest part of the Carpathians is the Tatra Mountains  along Poland s southern border  Geology Granite outcrop Silesian Rocks Maiden Rocks at Karkonosze  Giant Mountains   south western Poland The geological structure of Poland has been shaped by the continental collision of Europe and Africa over the past 60 million years  on the one hand  and the Quaternary glaciations of northern Europe  on the other  Both processes shaped the Sudetes and the Carpathian Mountains  The moraine landscape of northern Poland contains soils made up mostly of sand or loam  while the ice age river valleys of the south often contain loess  The Cracow Cz stochowa Upland  the Pieniny  and the Western Tatras consist of limestone  while the High Tatras  the Beskids  and the Karkonosze are made up mainly of granite and basalts  The Polish Jura Chain is one of the oldest mountain ranges on earth  Giewont in the High Tatras  the mountainous south is a popular destination for hikers Poland has 70 mountains over 2 000 metres  6 600 ft  in elevation  all in the Tatras  The Polish Tatras  which consist of the High Tatras and the Western Tatras  is the highest mountain group of Poland and of the entire Carpathian range  In the High Tatras lies Poland s highest point  the north western peak of Rysy  2 499 metres  8 199 ft  in elevation  At its foot lies the mountain lakes Czarny Staw pod Rysami and Morskie Oko  The second highest mountain group in Poland is the Beskids  whose highest peak is Babia G ra  at 1 725 metres  5 659 ft   The next highest mountain group is the Karkonosze in the Sudetes  whose highest point is  nie ka  at 1 602 metres  5 256 ft   Among the most beautiful mountains of Poland are the Bieszczady Mountains in the far southeast of Poland  whose highest point in Poland is Tarnica  with an elevation of 1 346 metres  4 416 ft   Tourists also frequent the Gorce Mountains in Gorce National Park  whose highest point is Turbacz  with elevations 1 310 metres  4 298 ft   and the Pieniny in Pieniny National Park  whose highest point is Wysokie Ska ki  Wysoka   with elevations 1 050 metres  3 445 ft   The lowest point in Poland   at 2 metres  6 6 ft  below sea level   is at Raczki Elbl skie  near Elbl g in the Vistula Delta  Dunes in S owi ski National Park B  d w Desert is a desert located in southern Poland in the Silesian Voivodeship and stretches over the Zag  bie D browskie region  It has a total area of 32 square kilometres  12 sq mi   It is the only desert located in Poland  It is one of only five natural deserts in Europe  It is the warmest desert that appears at this latitude  It was created thousands of years ago by a melting glacier  The specific geological structure has been of big importance  The average thickness of the sand layer is about 40 metres  131 ft   with a maximum of 70 metres  230 ft   which made the fast and deep drainage very easy  The sea s activity in S owi ski National Park created sand dunes which in the course of time separated the bay from the Baltic Sea  As waves and wind carry sand inland the dunes slowly move  at a speed of 3 to 10 metres  9 8 to 32 8 ft  meters per year  Some dunes are quite high   up to 30 metres  98 ft   The highest peak of the park   Rowokol  115 metres   377 feet above sea level    is also an excellent observation point  Waters See also  Rivers of Poland and Category Lakes of Poland Vistula River in

rivers in Pomerania  The  yna and the Angrapa flow by way of the Pregolya to the Baltic  and the Czarna Ha cza flows into the Baltic through the Neman  While the great majority of Poland s rivers drain into the Baltic Sea  Poland s Beskids are the source of some of the upper tributaries of the Orava  which flows via the V h and the Danube to the Black Sea  The eastern Beskids are also the source of some streams that drain through the Dniester to the Black Sea  Poland s rivers have been used since early times for navigation  The Vikings  for example  traveled up the Vistula and the Oder in their longships  In the Middle Ages and in early modern times  when the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth was the breadbasket of Europe  the shipment of grain and other agricultural products down the Vistula toward Gda sk and onward to other parts of Europe took on great importance  Kurtkowiec  oligotrophic lake in southeastern Poland With almost ten thousand closed bodies of water covering more than 1 hectare  2 47 acres  each  Poland has one of the highest numbers of lakes in the world  In Europe  only Finland has a greater density of lakes  The largest lakes  covering more than 100 square kilometres  39 sq mi   are Lake  niardwy and Lake Mamry in Masuria  and Lake  ebsko and Lake Drawsko in Pomerania  In addition to the lake districts in the north  in Masuria  Pomerania  Kashubia  Lubuskie  and Greater Poland   there is also a large number of mountain lakes in the Tatras  of which the Morskie Oko is the largest in area  The lake with the greatest depth of more than 100 metres

were settled are those in the Greater Polish Lake District  The stilt house settlement of Biskupin  occupied by more than one thousand residents  was founded before the 7th century BC by people of the Lusatian culture  Lakes have always played an important role in Polish history and continue to be of great importance to today s modern Polish society  The ancestors of today s Poles  the Polanie  built their first fortresses on islands in these lakes  The legendary Prince Popiel is supposed to have ruled from Kruszwica on Lake Gop o  The first historically documented ruler of Poland  Duke Mieszko I  had his palace on an island in the Warta River in Pozna   Nowadays the Polish lakes provide an invaluable location for the pursuit of water sports such as yachting and wind surfing  Bay of Puck  Zatoka Pucka  in Poland The Polish Baltic coast is approximately 528 kilometres  328 mi  long and extends from  winouj cie on the islands of Usedom and Wolin in the west to Krynica Morska on the Vistula Spit in the east  For the most part  Poland has a smooth coastline  which has been shaped by the continual movement of sand by currents and winds  This continual erosion and deposition has formed cliffs  dunes  and spits  many of which have migrated landwards to close off former lagoons  such as  ebsko Lake in S owi ski National Park  Prior to the end of the Second World War and subsequent change in national borders  Poland had only a very small coastline  this was situated at the end of the  Polish Corridor   the only internationally recognised Polish territory which afforded the country access to the sea  However after World War II  the redrawing of Poland s borders and resulting  shift  of the country s borders left it with a greatly expanded coastline  thus allowing for far greater access to the sea than was ever previously possible  The significance of this event  and importance of it to Poland s future as a major industrialised nation  was allured to by the 1945 Wedding to the Sea  The largest spits are Hel Peninsula and the Vistula Spit  The largest Polish Baltic island is Wolin  The largest port cities are Gdynia  Gda sk  Szczecin  and  winouj

than half of the land is devoted to agriculture  While the total area under cultivation is declining  the remaining farmland is more intensively cultivated  More than 1  of Poland s territory  3 145 square kilometres  1 214 sq mi   is protected within 23 Polish national parks  Three more national parks are projected for Masuria  the Cracow Cz stochowa Upland  and the eastern Beskids  In addition  wetlands along lakes and rivers in central Poland are legally protected  as are coastal areas in the north  There are over 120 areas designated as landscape parks  along with numerous nature reserves and other protected areas  Present day Poland is a country with great agricultural prospects  there are over two million private farms in the country  and Poland is the leading producer in Europe of potatoes and rye and is one of the world s largest producers of sugar beets and triticale  This has led Poland to be described on occasion as the future  bread basket of the European Union   However  despite employing around 16  of the workforce  agricultural output in Poland remains low and the industry is characterised as largely inefficient due to the large number of small  independent farms  This situation is likely to soon change for the better with the government debating agricultural reform and currently pursuing the option of auctioning off large tracts of state owned agricultural land  Biodiversity Family of White Stork  Poland hosts the largest White Stork population  46  Phytogeographically  Poland belongs to the Central European province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom  According to the World Wide Fund for Nature  the territory of Poland can be subdivided into three ecoregions  the Baltic mixed forests  Central European mixed forests and Carpathian montane conifer forests  A wisent in the Bia owie a Forest Many animals that have since died out in other parts of Europe still survive in Poland  such as the wisent in the ancient woodland of the Bia owie a Forest and in Podlaskie  Other such species include the brown bear in Bia owie a  in the Tatras  and in the Beskids  the gray wolf and the Eurasian Lynx in various forests  the moose in northern Poland  and the beaver in Masuria  Pomerania  and Podlaskie  In the forests  one also encounters game animals  such as Red Deer  Roe Deer and Wild Boars  In eastern Poland there are a number of ancient woodlands  like Bia owie a forest  that have never been cleared by people  There are also large forested areas in the mountains  Masuria  Pomerania  Lubusz Land and Lower Silesia  Poland is the most important breeding ground for European migratory birds  Out of all of the migratory birds who come to Europe for the summer  one quarter breed in Poland  particularly in the lake districts and the wetlands along the Biebrza  the Narew  and the Warta  which are part of nature reserves or national parks  Climate The average daytime summer temperature at sea level along the Baltic coast is 22  C  71 6  F  47  The climate is mostly temperate throughout the country  The climate is oceanic in the north and west and becomes gradually warmer and continental towards the south and east  Summers are generally warm  with average temperatures between 18  C  64  F  and 30  C  86 0  F  depending on a region  Winters are rather cold  with average temperatures around 3  C  37 4  F  in the northwest and  6  C  21  F  in the northeast  Precipitation falls throughout the year  although  especially in the east  winter is drier than summer  The warmest region in Poland is Lower Silesian located in south western Poland where temperatures in the summer average between 24  C  75 2  F  and 32  C  90  F  but can go as high as 34  C  93 2  F  to 39  C  102 2  F  on some days in

Poland is in the northeast in the Podlaskie Voivodeship near the border of Belarus  Usually the coldest city is Suwa ki  The climate is affected by cold fronts which come from Scandinavia and Siberia  The average temperature in the winter in Podlaskie ranges from  6  C  21  F  to  4  C  25  F   Politics Main article  Politics of Poland President of Poland Bronis aw Komorowski Poland is a democracy  with a president as a head of state  whose current constitution dates from 1997  The government structure centers on the Council of Ministers  led by a prime minister  The president appoints the cabinet according to the proposals of the prime minister  typically from the majority coalition in the Sejm  The president is elected by popular vote every five years  The current president is Bronis aw Komorowski  Komorowski replaced President Lech Kaczy ski following an April 10  2010 air crash which claimed the life of President Kaczynski  his wife  and 94 other people  during a visit to western Russia for events marking the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre  The current prime minister  Donald Tusk  was appointed in 2007 after his party made significant gains in that year s parliamentary elections  In 2011  Tusk became the first Polish prime minister in history to be democratically re elected for a consecutive term  Polish voters elect a bicameral parliament consisting of a 460 member lower house  Sejm  and a 100 member Senate  Senat   The Sejm is elected under proportional representation according to the d Hondt method  a method similar to that used in many parliamentary political systems  The Senat  on the other hand  is elected under the First past the post voting method  with one senator being returned from each of the 100 constituencies  The Sejm s session chamber in Warsaw With the exception of ethnic minority parties  only candidates of political parties receiving at least 5  of the total national vote can enter the Sejm  When sitting in joint session  members of the Sejm and Senat form the National Assembly  the Zgromadzenie Narodowe   The National Assembly is formed on three occasions  when a new President takes the oath of office  when an indictment against the President of the Republic is brought to the State Tribunal  Trybuna  Stanu   and when a president s permanent incapacity to exercise his duties because of the state of his health is declared  To date only the first instance has occurred  The judicial branch plays an important role in decision making  Its major institutions include the Supreme Court of the Republic of Poland  S d Najwy szy   the Supreme Administrative Court of the Republic of Poland  Naczelny S d Administracyjny   the Constitutional Tribunal of the Republic of Poland  Trybuna  Konstytucyjny   and the State Tribunal of the Republic of Poland  Trybuna  Stanu   On the approval of the Senat  the Sejm also appoints the ombudsman or the Commissioner for Civil Rights Protection  Rzecznik Praw Obywatelskich  for a five year term  The ombudsman has the duty of guarding the observance and implementation of the rights and liberties of Polish citizens and residents  of the law and of principles of community life and social justice  In 2011  Poles elected Anna Grodzka as the first ever transsexual MP in European history  48  and the second transgender MP in European history  after the Italian Vladimir Luxuria  49  Law Main article  Law of Poland The Supreme Court building in Warsaw The Constitution of May 3  1791 has been called the first of its kind in Europe  50  The Constitution of Poland is the supreme law in contemporary Poland  and the Polish legal system is based on the principle of civil rights  governed by the code of Civil Law  Historically  the most famous Polish legal act is the Constitution of May 3  1791  Historian Norman Davies describes it as the first of its kind in Europe  50  The Constitution was instituted as a Government Act  Polish  Ustawa rz dowa  and then adopted on May 3  1791 by the Sejm of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth  Primarily  it was designed to redress long standing political defects of the federative Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth and its Golden Liberty  Previously only the Henrican articles signed by each of Poland s elected kings could perform the function of a set of basic laws  The new Constitution introduced political equality between townspeople and the nobility  szlachta   and placed the peasants under the protection of the government  thus mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom  The Constitution abolished pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the liberum veto  which at one time had placed the sejm at the mercy of any deputy who might choose  or be bribed by an interest or foreign power  to have rescinded all the legislation that had been passed by that sejm  The May 3rd Constitution sought to supplant the existing anarchy fostered by some of the country s reactionary magnates  with a more egalitarian and democratic constitutional monarchy  Unfortunately  the adoption of such a liberal constitution was treated as a grave threat by Poland s more autocratic neighbours  In response Prussia  Austria and Russia formed an anti Polish alliance and over the next decade collaborated with one another to partition their weaker neighbour and ultimately destroy the Polish state  In the words of two of its co authors  Ignacy Potocki and Hugo Ko   taj  the constitution represented  the last will and testament of the expiring Fatherland   Despite this  its text influenced many later democratic movements across the globe  Poland s current constitution was adopted by the National Assembly of Poland on 2 April 1997  approved by a national referendum on 25 May 1997  and came into effect on 17 October 1997  It guarantees a multi party state  the freedoms of religion  speech and assembly  and specifically casts off many Communist ideals to create a  free market economic system   It requires public officials to pursue ecologically sound public policy and acknowledges the inviolability of the home  the right to form trade unions  and to strike  whilst at the same time prohibiting the practices of forced medical experimentation  torture and corporal punishment  Foreign relations Main article  Foreign relations of Poland Foreign Secretary Sikorski meets US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton In recent years  Poland has extended its responsibilities and position in European and international affairs  supporting and establishing friendly relations with other European nations and a large number of  developing  countries  In 1994  Poland became an associate member of the European Union  EU  and its defensive arm  the Western European Union  WEU   having subimtted preliminary documentation for full membership in 1996  it formally joined the European Union in May 2004  along with the other members of the Visegr d group  In 1996  Poland achieved full OECD membership  and at the 1997 Madrid Summit was invited to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in the first wave of policy enlargement finally becoming a full member of NATO in March 1999  Prime Minister Donald Tusk  right  arrives with former President Lech Wa  sa for the EPP party congress in Warsaw As changes since the fall of Communism in 1989 have redrawn the map of central Europe  Poland has tried to forge strong and mutually beneficial relationships with its seven new neighbours  this has notably included signing  friendship treaties  to replace links severed by the collapse of the Warsaw Pact  The Poles have forged special relationships with Lithuania and particularly Ukraine  51  with whom they will co host the UEFA Euro 2012 football tournament  in an effort to firmly anchor these countries within the Western world and provide them with an alternative to aligning themselves with the Russian Federation respectively  Despite many positive developments in the region  Poland has found itself in a position where it must seek to defend the rights of ethnic Poles living in the former Soviet Union  this is particularly true of Belarus  where in 2005 the Lukashenko regime launched a campaign against the Polish ethnic minority  52  Poland is the sixth most populous member state of the European Union and  ever since joining in 2004  has pursued policies to increase its role in European affairs  Poland has a grand total of 51 representatives in the European Parliament and in addition to this  since 14 July 2009  former Prime Minister of Poland Jerzy Buzek  has been President of the European Parliament  53  Administrative divisions Main article  Administrative division of Poland Poland s current voivodeships  provinces  are largely based on the country s historic regions  whereas those of the past two decades  to 1998  had been centred on and named for individual cities  The new units range in area from less than 10 000 square kilometres  3 900 sq mi  for Opole Voivodeship to more than 35 000 square kilometres  14 000 sq mi  for Masovian Voivodeship  Administrative authority at voivodeship level is shared between a government appointed voivode  governor   an elected regional assembly  sejmik  and an executive elected by that assembly  The voivodeships are subdivided into powiats  often referred to in English as counties   and these are further divided into gminas  also known as communes or municipalities   Major cities normally have the status of both gmina and powiat  Poland currently has 16 voivodeships  379 powiats  including 65 cities with powiat status   and 2 478 gminas  West Pomeranian Pomeranian Warmian Masurian Podlaskie Lubusz Greater Poland Kuyavian  Pomeranian Lower Silesian Opole Silesian  wi tokrzyskie   d  Masovian Lublin

Land Forces  Wojska L dowe   Navy  Marynarka Wojenna   Air Force  Si y Powietrzne  and Special Forces  Wojska Specjalne   The military is subordinate to the Minister for National Defence  however its sole commander in chief is the President of the Republic  The Polish army currently consists of 65 000 active personnel  whilst the navy and air force respectively employ 14 300 and 26 126 servicemen and women  The Polish Navy is one of the bigger navies on the Baltic Sea and is mostly involved in Baltic Sea operations such as search and rescue provision for the section of the Baltic under Polish command  as well as hydrographic measurements and research  recently however  the Polish Navy played a more international role as part of the 2003 invasion of Iraq  providing logistical support for the United States Navy  The current position of the Polish Air Force is much the same  it has routinely taken part in Baltic Air Policing assignments  but otherwise  with the exception of a number of units serving in Afghanistan  has seen no active combat since the end of the Second World War  In 2003  the F 16C Block 52 was chosen as the new general multi role fighter for the air force  the first deliveries taking place in November 2006  it is expected  2010  that the Polish Air Force will create three squadrons of F 16s  which will all be fully operational by 2012  Polish Army vehicles and troops on patrol in Afghanistan The most important mission of the armed forces is the defence of Polish territorial integrity and Polish interests abroad  54  Poland s national security goal is to further integrate with NATO and European defence  economic  and political institutions through the modernisation and reorganisation of its military  54  Currently the armed forces is being re organised according to NATO standards  and as of 1 January 2010  the transition to an entirely contract based military has been completed  Previously male citizens were expected to complete a period of active service with the military  since 2007 up until the amendment of the law on conscription  the obligatory term of service was nine months  55  Polish military doctrine reflects the same defensive nature as that of its NATO partners  From 1953 to 2009 Poland was a large contributor to various United Nations peacekeeping missions  54  56  The Polish Armed Forces took part in the 2003 invasion of Iraq  deploying 2 500 soldiers in the south of that country and commanding the 17 nation Multinational force in Iraq  The military was temporarily  but severely  affected by the loss of many of its top commanders in the wake the 2010 Polish Air Force Tu 154 crash near Smolensk  Russia  which killed all 96 passengers and crew  including  amongst others  the Chief of the Polish Army s General Staff Franciszek G gor and Polish Air Force commanding general Andrzej B asik  They were en route from Warsaw to attend an event to mark the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre  whose site is commemorated approximately 19 km west of Smolensk  57  58  Law enforcement and emergency services A mounted officer of the State Police in Pozna  Main articles  Law enforcement in Poland and Emergency medical services in Poland Poland has a highly developed system of law enforcement with a long history of effective policing by the State Police Service  The structure of law enforcement agencies within Poland is a multi tier one  with the State Police providing criminal investigative services  Municipal Police serving to maintain public order and a number of other specialised agencies  such as the Polish Border Guard  acting to fulfil their assigned missions  In addition to these state services  private security companies are also common  although they possess no powers assigned to state agencies  such as  for example  the power to make an arrest or detain a suspect  Emergency services in Poland consist of the Emergency Medical Services  Search and Rescue units of the Polish Armed Forces and State Fire Service  Emergency medical services in Poland are  unlike other services  provided for by local and regional government  Since joining the European Union all of Poland s emergency services have been undergoing major restructuring and have  in the process  acquired large amounts of new equipment and staff  59  All emergency services personnel are now uniformed and can be easily recognised thanks to a number of innovative design features  such as reflective paint and printing  present throughout their service dress and vehicle liveries  In addition to this  in an effort to comply with EU standards and safety regulations  the police and other agencies have been steadily replacing and modernising their fleets of vehicles  this has left them with thousands of new automobiles  as well as many new aircraft  boats and helicopters  60  Economy Main article  Economy of Poland Financial centre of Warsaw Poland s high income economy 61  is considered to be one of the healthiest of the post Communist countries and is currently one of the fastest growing within the EU  Having a strong domestic market  low private debt  flexible currency  and not being dependent on a single export sector  Poland is the only European economy to have avoided the late 2000s recession  62  Since the fall of the communist government  Poland has steadfastly pursued a policy of liberalising the economy and today stands out as a successful example of the transition from a centrally planned economy to a primarily market based economy  In 2009 Poland had the highest GDP growth in the EU  As of February 2012  the Polish economy has not entered a recession in the wake of the global financial crisis  63  64  The privatization of small and medium state owned companies and a liberal law on establishing new firms have allowed the development of an aggressive private sector  As a consequence  consumer rights organizations have also appeared  Restructuring and privatisation of  sensitive sectors  such as coal  steel  rail transport and energy has been continuing since 1990  Between 2007 and 2010  the government plans to float twenty public companies on the Warsaw Stock Exchange  including parts of the coal industry  The biggest privatisations have been the sale of the national telecoms firm Telekomunikacja Polska to France T l com in 2000  and an issue of 30  of the shares in Poland s largest bank  PKO Bank Polski  on the Polish stockmarket in 2004  Poland is part of the Schengen Area and the EU single market  and it is among the countries obliged to join the Eurozone  green   the Eurozone itself is blue   The Polish banking sector is the largest in central and eastern Europe as well being as the largest and the most highly developed sector of the country s financial markets  It is regulated by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority  During the transformation to a market oriented economy  the government privatized some banks  recapitalized the rest and introduced legal reforms that made the sector competitive  This has attracted a significant number of strategic foreign investors  Poland s banking sector has approximately 5 domestic banks  a network of nearly 600 cooperative banks and 18 branches of foreign owned banks  In addition  foreign investors have controlling stakes in nearly 40 commercial banks  which make up 68  of the banking capital  65  Poland has a large number of private farms in its agricultural sector  with the potential to become a leading producer of food in the European Union  Structural reforms in health care  education  the pension system  and state administration have resulted in larger than expected fiscal pressures  Warsaw leads Central Europe in foreign investment  66 GDP growth had been strong and steady from 1993 to 2000 with only a short slowdown from 2001 to 2002  The economy had growth of 3 7  annually in 2003  a rise from 1 4  annually in 2002  In 2004  GDP growth equaled 5 4   in 2005 3 3  and in 2006 6 2   67  According to Eurostat data  Polish PPS GDP per capita stood at 61  of the EU average in 2009  68  Gdynia  situated at Gda sk Bay on the south coast of the Baltic Sea  is an important seaport of Poland  Although the Polish economy is currently undergoing economic development  there are many challenges ahead  The most notable task on the horizon is the preparation of the economy  through continuing deep structural reforms  to allow Poland to meet the strict economic criteria for entry into the Eurozone  According to the Polish foreign minister Rados aw Sikorski the country could join the eurozone before 2016  69  Some businesses may already accept the euro as payment  In addition  the ability to establish and conduct business easily has been cause for economic hardship as the World Economic Forum recently ranked Poland near the bottom of OECD countries in terms of the clarity  efficiency and neutrality of its legal framework for firm to settle disputes  70  A report concluded that on going foreign business disputes issues may  have damaged Poland s reputation as an attractive location for FDI  by reinforcing the impression of  Poland s substandard reputation for maintaining an efficient and neutral framework to settle business disputes involving multinational foreign investors   71  Ernst  amp  Young s 2010 European attractiveness survey reported that Poland saw a 52  decrease in FDI job creation and a 42  decrease in number of FDI projects since 2008  72  Average salaries in the enterprise sector in December 2010 were 3 848 PLN  1 012 euro or 1 374 US dollars  73  and growing sharply  74  Salaries vary between the regions  the median wage in the capital city Warsaw was 4 603 PLN  1 177 euro or 1 680 US dollars  while in Kielce it was only 3 083 PLN  788 euro or 1125 US dollars   Differences in salaries in various districts of Poland is even higher and range from 2 020 PLN  517 euro or 737 US dollars  in K pno County  which is located in Greater Poland Voivodeship to 5 616  1 436 euro or 2 050 US dollars  in Lubin County  which lies in Lower Silesian Voivodeship  75  According to a Credit Suisse report  Poles are the second wealthiest  after Czechs  of the Central European peoples  76  77  This makes Poland an attractive destination for many guest workers particularly from Ukraine  Belarus  Russia and Vietnam  78  79  80  Even though Poland is rather an ethnically homogeneous country  the number of foreigners is growing every year  80  81  Since the United Kingdom  Ireland and some other European countries opened their job markets for Poles  many workers  especially from rural regions  have left the country to seek a better wages abroad  However  there is a rapid growth of the salaries  booming economy

 PKP  Mostostal  PZU Insurance  and TVP  85  Poland is recognised as having an economy with significant development potential  overtaking the Netherlands in mid 2010 to become Europe s sixth largest economy  86 Foreign Direct Investment in Poland has remained strong ever since the country s re democratisation following the Round Table Agreement in 1989  Despite this  problems do exist  and further progress in achieving success depends largely on the government s privatisation of Poland s remaining state industries and continuing development and modernisation of the economy  The list

is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the main tourist attractions of Lublin Voivodeship  Poland is a major part of the global tourism market and is currently experiencing an upward trend in its number of visitors  this began shortly after joining the European Union  88 Tourism in Poland contributes to the country s overall economy and makes up a relatively large proportion of the country s service market  The most attractive urban destinations for tourists are Warsaw  Krak w  Wroc aw  Pozna   Lublin and Toru   in addition to these the historic site of the Auschwitz concentration camp near O wi cim is a noteworthy place of pilgrimage and a now constitutes a major monument to the prevention of war and suffering in Southern Poland  Popular areas of natural beauty include northeast Poland s Masurian Lake District and Bia owie a Forest  Poland s main tourist offerings are thought to be based around city sightseeing and extra urban historical monuments  business trips  qualified tourism  agrotourism  and mountain hiking  among others  Poland was the 17th most visited country by foreign tourists in 2008  89  Energy  era  power station in Warsaw Main article  Energy in Poland The electricity generation sector in Poland is still largely fossil fuel based  Many power plants nationwide use Poland s position as a major European exporter of coal to their advantage by continuing to use coal as the primary raw material in production of their energy  in 2007  hard bituminous coal contributed 48  of energy generation  brown coal and gas 12  each and oil 23   90  Currently the three largest Polish coal mining firms  Weglokoks  Kompania W glowa and JSW  extract around 100 million tonnes of coal annually  all three of these companies are key constituents of the Warsaw Stock Exchange s lead economic indexes  Renewable forms of energy currently only account for a small proportion of Poland s full energy generation capacity  91  However  the national government has set targets for the development of renewable energy sources in Poland which should see the portion of power produced by renewable resources climb to 7 5  by 2010 and 15  by 2020  This is to be achieved mainly through the construction of wind farms and a number of hydroelectric stations  Poland is thought to have around 164 800 000 000 m  of proven natural gas reserves and around 96 380 000 barrels of proven oil reserves  These reserves are currently attended to and exploited by energy supply companies such as PKN Orlen  the only Polish company listed in the Fortune Global 500   However  due to the small amounts of fossil fuels naturally occurring in Poland not being enough to satisfy the full energy consumption needs of the population and thus need to buy from abroad  the country is considered to be a net importer of oil and natural gas  Transport LOT Boeing 767  City of Pozna   on stand at Warsaw Chopin Airport Main article  Transport in Poland Today transport in Poland is provided by means of rail  road  shipping and air travel  Positioned in Central Europe and with an eastern border compromising the largest external border of the Schengen Area with the rest of East Central Europe  Poland has long been  and remains a key country through which imports to and exports from the European Union pass  Since joining the EU in 2004  Poland has invested large amounts of money into the modernisation of its transport networks  The country now has a developing expressways network compromised of motorways such as the A4 and express roads such as the S7  In addition to these newly built roads  many local and regional roads are being rebuilt as part of a national programme to rebuild all roads in Poland  92  The A4 Motorway near Krak w Again  with regard to railways  much the same situation is taking place  The Polish authorities have begun a program by which they hope to increase operating speeds across the entire Polish rail network  this is particularly true of a number of national trunk routes which are expected to soon receive new rolling stock capable of speeds over 200 km h  Finally  there is a plan to introduce high speed rail to Poland from around 2014  The Polish government recently revealed that it intends to connect all major cities to a future high speed rail network by 2020  93  Most intercity rail operations in Poland are operated by PKP Intercity whilst regional trains are run by a number of operators  the largest of which is Przewozy Regionalne  The air and maritime transport markets in Poland are largely well developed  although construction of new airport and seaport facilities is ongoing  Poland has a number of international airports  the largest of which is Warsaw Chopin Airport  the primary global hub for LOT Polish Airlines  which is the largest airline of Central and Eastern Europe and one of the world s oldest airlines still in operation today  Seaports exist all along Poland s Baltic Sea coast  with most freight operations using either Gdynia or Gda sk as their base  Passenger ferries link Poland with Scandinavia all year round  these services are provided from Gda sk by Polferries  Stena Line from Gdynia and Unity Line from the Port of  winouj cie  Science Main article  Polish science and technology In 1925  the chemist Maria Sk odowska  Curie established the first Radium Institute in Poland  94  According to Frost  amp  Sullivan s Country Industry Forecast the country is becoming an interesting location for research and development investments  95  Multinational companies such as  ABB  Delphi  GlaxoSmithKline  Google  Hewlett Packard  IBM  Intel  LG Electronics  Microsoft  Motorola  Siemens and Samsung have set up research and development centres in Poland  96  Over 40 research and development centers and 4 500 researchers make Poland the biggest research and development hub in Central and Eastern Europe  79  95  Companies chose Poland because of the availability of highly qualified labour force  presence of universities  support of authorities  and the largest market in Central Europe  95  Warsaw s Staszic Palace is home to the Polish Academy of Sciences Today Poland s tertiary education institutions  traditional universities  found in its major cities   as well as technical  medical  and economic institutions  employ around 61 000 researchers and members of staff  There are around 300 research and development institutes  with about 10 000 researchers  In total  there are around 91 000 scientists in Poland today  However  in the 19th and 20th centuries many Polish scientists worked abroad  one of the greatest of these exiles was Maria Sk odowska Curie  a physicist and chemist who lived much of her life in France  In the first half of the 20th century  Poland was a flourishing centre of mathematics  Outstanding Polish mathematicians formed the Lw w School of Mathematics  with Stefan Banach  Hugo Steinhaus  Stanis aw Ulam  and Warsaw School of Mathematics  with Alfred Tarski  Kazimierz Kuratowski  Wac aw Sierpi ski   The events of World War II pushed many of them into exile  Such was the case of Beno t Mandelbrot  whose family left Poland when he was still a child  An alumnus of the Warsaw School of Mathematics was Antoni Zygmund  one of the shapers of 20th century mathematical analysis  According to a KPMG report 97  80  of Poland s current investors are content with their choice and willing to reinvest  In 2006  Intel decided to double the number of employees in its research and development centre in Gda sk  96  Communications Main article  Telecommunications in Poland The Main Municipal Post Office of Bydgoszcz The share of the telecom sector in the GDP is 4 4   end of 2000 figure   compared to 2 5  in 1996  Nevertheless  despite high expenditures for telecom infrastructure  the coverage increased from 78 users per 1 000 inhabitants in 1989 to 282 in 2000   The value of the telecommunication market is zl 38 2bn  2006   and it grew by 12 4  in 2007 PMR  98  The coverage mobile cellular is over 1000 users per 1000 people  2007   Telephones mobile cellular  38 7 million  Onet pl  amp  GUS Report  2007   telephones main lines in use  12 5 million  Telecom Team Report  2005   With regard to internet access  the most popular ADSL services for home users in Poland are Neostrada provided by TPSA  and Net24 provided by Netia  Business users as well as some home users use Internet DSL TP also offered by TPSA  According to Eurostat  OECD and others  Internet access in Poland is amidst the most expensive in Europe  This is mostly caused by the lack of competitiveness  New operators  such as Dialog and GTS Energis are making their own provider lines and offer more attractive and cheaper service  Recently  the Polish Office of Electronical Communication passed a bill forcing the TPSA to rent 51  of their ADSL lines to other ISPs for 60  lower prices  This move will definitely affect the prices of DSL in Poland  TP S A  headquarters in Warsaw The public postal service in Poland is operated by Poczta Polska  The Polish Post   It was created on October 18  1558  when king Zygmunt August established a permanent postal route from Krak w to Venice  later also to Wilno  in order to manage affairs in Italy that arose after the death of Queen Bona  his mother  Since then the service was dissolved on a number of occasions  most notably during the partitions of Poland  After regaining independence in 1918  the united territory of Poland was in need of a uniform network of communication  Thus  the interwar period saw the rapid development of the postal system as new services were introduced  e g  money transfers  payment of pensions  delivery of magazines  air mail   Although during national uprisings and in the course of wars communication was provided mainly through field post  which was subject to military authority  postmen always took active part in the fight for independence by secretly delivering parcels and documents  or by providing vital information about the enemy  Many important events in the history of Poland involved the postal service  like the heroic Defence of the Polish Post Office in Gda sk in 1939 and the participation of the Polish Scouts  Postal Service in the Warsaw Uprising  During the difficult times of the Second World War  the Polish Post in exile would lift up the spirits of compatriots by issuing postage stamps  Nowadays the service is a modern  functioning state owned company which provides a number of standard and express delivery options  as well as operating the Polish postal home delivery service  The postal service is currently expanding into the provision of logistical services  Demographics Main article  Demographics of Poland Poland  with 38 116 000 inhabitants  4  has the eighth largest population in Europe and the sixth largest in the European Union  It has a population density of 122 inhabitants per square kilometer  328 per square mile   Long Market in Gda sk filled with picturesque Dutch style tenements is a favourite meeting place in the Kashubian capital  Poland historically contained many languages  cultures and religions on its soil  The country had a particularly large Jewish population prior to World War II  when the Nazi Germany s regime led to Holocaust  It caused Poland s Jewish population  estimated at 3 million before the war  to drop to just 300 000  The outcome of the war  particularly the shift of Poland s borders to the area between the Curzon Line and the Oder Neisse line  coupled with post war expulsion of minorities  significantly reduced the country s ethnic diversity  Over 7 million Germans fled or were expelled from the Polish side of the Oder Neisse boundary  99  According to the 2002 census  36 983 700 people  or 96 74  of the population  consider themselves Polish  while 471 500  1 23   declared another nationality  and 774 900  2 03   did not declare any nationality  The largest minority nationalities and ethnic groups in Poland are Silesians  173 153 according to the census   Germans  152 897 according to the census  92  in Opole Voivodeship and Silesian Voivodeship   Belarusians  c  49 000   Ukrainians  c  30 000   Lithuanians  Russians  Roma  Jews  Lemkos  Slovaks  Czechs  and Lipka Tatars  100  Among foreign citizens  the Vietnamese are the largest ethnic group  followed by Greeks and Armenians  The Main Market Square in Krak w is the heart of Poland s southern cultural capital The Polish language  part of the West Slavic branch of the Slavic languages  functions as the official language of Poland  Until recent decades Russian was commonly learned as a second language but has been replaced by English and German as the most common second languages studied and spoken  101  In recent years  Poland s population has decreased because of an increase in emigration and a sharp drop in the birth rate  Since Poland s accession to the European Union  a significant number of Poles have emigrated  primarily to the United Kingdom  Germany and Ireland in search of work and better work opportunities abroad  In April 2007  the Polish population of the United Kingdom had risen to approximately 300 000  and estimates place the Polish population in Ireland at 65 000  Some sources claim that the number of Polish citizens who emigrated to the UK after 2004 is as high as 2 million  102  This  however  is contrasted by a recent trend that shows that more Poles are entering the country than leaving it  103  Polish minorities are still present in the neighboring countries of Ukraine  Belarus  and Lithuania  as well as in other countries  see Poles for population numbers   Altogether  the number of ethnic Poles living abroad is estimated to be around 20 million  104  The largest number of Poles outside of Poland can be found in the United States  105  Urbanization WarsawKrak w  d  Rank City Voivodeship Population

Protestant and Christian Orthodox minorities coexisted with a Roman Catholic majority  As a result of the Holocaust and the post World War II flight and expulsion of German and Ukrainian populations  Poland has become overwhelmingly Roman Catholic  In 2007  88 4  of the population belonged to the Catholic Church  106  Though rates of religious observance are lower  at 52  107  to 60   108  Poland remains one of the most devoutly religious countries in Europe  109  Holy Spirit Orthodox Church in Bia ystok From 16 October 1978 until his death on 2 April 2005 Karol J zef Wojty a  later Pope John Paul II   a natural born Pole  reigned as Supreme Pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church and Sovereign of Vatican City  His was the second longest documented pontificate  only Pope Pius IX served longer  He has been the only Slavic and Polish Pope to date  and was the first non Italian Pope since Dutch Pope Adrian VI in 1522  110  Additionally he is credited with having played a significant role in hastening the downfall of communism in Poland and throughout Central and Eastern Europe  he is famously quoted as having  at the height of communism in 1979  told Poles  not be afraid   later praying   Let your Spirit descend and change the image of the land    this land   111  112  He is a deeply revered figure within Polish society  and his passing in 2005 was met with large scale outpourings of national grief  Krak w s Tempel Synagogue is one of the largest in Poland still functioning today  Religious minorities include Polish Orthodox  about 506 800   4  various Protestants  about 150 000   4 Jehovah s Witnesses  126 827   4 Eastern Catholics  Mariavites  Polish Catholics  Jews  and Muslims  including the Tatars of Bia ystok   Members of Protestant churches include about 77 500 in the largest Evangelical Augsburg Church  4  and a similar number in smaller Pentecostal and Evangelical churches  Freedom of religion is now guaranteed by the 1989 statute of the Polish Constitution  113  enabling the emergence of additional denominations  114  However  because of pressure from the Polish Episcopate  the exposition of doctrine has entered the public education system as well  115  116  According to a 2007 survey  72  of respondents were not opposed to religious instruction in public schools  alternative courses in ethics are available only in one percent of the entire public educational system  117  Famous sites of Christian pilgrimage in Poland include the Monastery of Jasna G ra in the southern Polish city of Cz stochowa  as well as the Family home of John Paul II in Wadowice just outside of Krak w  Health Main article  Health in Poland Population pyramid of Poland in 2012 from International Futures Poland s healthcare system is based on an all inclusive insurance system  State subsidised healthcare is available to all Polish citizens who are covered by this general health insurance program  However  it is not compulsory to be treated in a state run hospital as a number of private medical complexes do exist nationwide  118  All medical service providers and hospitals in Poland are subordinate to the Polish Ministry of Health  which provides oversight and scrutiny of general medical practice as well as being responsible for the day to day administration of the healthcare system  In addition to these roles  the ministry is also tasked with the maintenance of standards of hygiene and patient care  Main clinical building of the Gda sk University Medical Centre in Wrzeszcz Hospitals in Poland are organised according to the regional administrative structure  resultantly most towns have their own hospital  Szpital Miejski   Larger and more specialised medical complexes tend only to be found in major cities  with some even more specialised units located only in the capital  Warsaw  However  all voivodeships have their own general hospital  most have more than one   all of which are obliged to have a trauma centre  these types of hospital  which are able to deal with almost all medical problems are called  regional hospitals   Szpital Wojew dzki   The last category of hospital in Poland is that of specialised medical centres  an example of which would be the Sk odowska Curie Institute of Oncology  Poland s leading  and most highly specialised centre for the research and treatment of cancer  The Polish health care industry is currently undergoing a major transformation  with many hospitals being listed as top priorities for refurbishment  119  As a result of this process  many hospitals have already been thoroughly modernised throughout and are now equipped with the latest in medical hardware  The overall quality of healthcare provision nationwide  as judged by European standards  is generally regarded as being very high  120  This is reflected in the nation s average life expectancy  which at 71 for males and 80 for females  121  has shown a marked increase from 63 68 in 2003  and now corresponds with the average figures for life expectancy in the European Union  Education Main article  Education in Poland The Collegium Maius is the oldest building of the Jagiellonian University in Krak w The education of Polish society was a goal of rulers as early as the 12th century  and Poland soon became one of the most educated countries in Europe  The library catalogue of the Cathedral Chapter of Krak w dating back to 1110 shows that in the early 12th century Polish intellectuals had access to European literature  The Jagiellonian University  founded in 1364 by King Casimir III in Krak w  is one of Europe s oldest universities  In 1773 King Stanis aw August Poniatowski established the Commission of National Education  Komisja Edukacji Narodowej   the world s first state ministry of education  The first university in Poland  Krak w s Jagiellonian University  was established in 1364 by Casimir III the Great in Krak w  It is the oldest university in Poland  It is the second oldest university in Central Europe and one of the oldest universities in the world  The idea to found the university was first conceived when Poland s King Casimir III realized that the nation needed a class of educated people  especially lawyers  who could codify the country s laws and administer the courts and offices  His efforts to found an institution of higher learning in Poland were finally rewarded when Pope Urban V granted him permission to open the University of Krakow  The wearing of traditional academic dress is an important feature of Polish educational ceremonies Since changes made in 2009 education in Poland starts at the age of five or six for the 0 class  Kindergarten  and six or seven years in the 1st class of primary school  Polish szko a podstawowa   It is compulsory that children do one year of formal education before entering 1st class at no later than 7 years of age  At the end of 6th class when the students are 13  they take a compulsory exam that will determine to which lower secondary school  gimnazjum  pronounced gheem nah sium   Middle School Junior High  they will be accepted  They will attend this school for three years for classes  7  8  and 9  They then take another compulsory exam to determine the upper secondary level school they will attend  There are several alternatives  the most common being the three years in a liceum or four years in a technikum  Both end with a maturity examination  matura  quite similar to French baccalaur at   and may be followed by several forms of upper education  leading to licencjat or in ynier  the Polish Bologna Process first cycle qualification   magister  the Polish Bologna Process second cycle qualification  and eventually doktor  the Polish Bologna Process third cycle qualification   122  The Adam Mickiewicz University  Pozna  There are currently 18 fully accredited traditional universities in Poland  these are then further supplemented by 20 technical universities  nine independent medical universities and five universities for the study of economics  In addition to these institutions there are then nine agricultural academies  three pedagogical universities  a theological academy and three maritime service universities  Poland s long and history of promoting the arts has led to the establishment of a number of higher educational institutes dedicated to the teaching of the arts  Amongst these are the seven higher state academies of music  All of these institutions are further supplemented by a large number of private educational institutions and the four national military academies  two for the army and one for each of the other branches of service   bringing the total number of organisations for the pursuit of higher education to well over 500  one of the largest numbers in Europe  The Programme for International Student Assessment  coordinated by the OECD  currently ranks Poland s educational system as the 23rd best in the world  being neither significantly higher nor lower than the OECD average  123  Culture Main article  Culture of Poland The culture of Poland is closely connected with its intricate 1000 year history 124  Its unique character developed as a result of its geography at the confluence of European cultures  With origins in the culture of the Proto Slavs  over time Polish culture has been profoundly influenced by its interweaving ties with the Germanic  Latinate and Byzantine worlds as well as in continual dialog with the many other ethnic groups and minorities living in Poland  125  The people of Poland have traditionally been seen as hospitable to artists from abroad and eager to follow cultural and artistic trends popular in other countries  In the 19th and 20th centuries the Polish focus on cultural advancement often took precedence over political and economic activity  These factors have contributed to the versatile nature of Polish art  with all its complex nuances  125  Famous people Miko aj

tolerance towards minorities  as well as absence of discrimination on the grounds of religion  nationality or race  It has a high level of gender equality  promotes disability rights movement and promotes equality  Poland is legally and socially tolerant towards homosexuality  being reportedly the only country in the history of Europe which has not punished LGBTQ  and the only country in the world to have a transsexual lawmaker  MP Anna Grodzka  132  Poland is the first country in the world where corporal punishment was prohibited  133  Poland has  throughout most of its long history  experienced only very limited immigration from abroad  this trend can largely be attributed to Poland s lack of slavery and overseas colonies as well as its lack of existence as a state during much of the 19th and early 20th centuries  Despite this  the country has for a long time been regarded as having a very tolerant society  which affords equal rights to all people no matter what their ethnic background  This can be said to stem largely from the reign of King Casimir III the Great and his acceptance for Poland s Jewish community  in a time when the most of Europe recessed antisemitic mood  The history of Jews in Poland shows peaceful co existence of a nation and particular ethnic group  As many as 96 7  of Polish citizens declare to be Poles  and 97 8  declare that they speak Polish at home  Census 2002   The population of Poland became one of the most ethnically homogeneous in the world as a result of the radically altered borders after World War II and the subsequent migrations  This homogeneity is a result of post World War II deportations ordered by the Soviet Union authorities  who wished to remove the sizeable Polish minorities from Lithuania  Belarus and Ukraine and repatriation of Ukrainians from Poland to the Soviet Union  see territorial changes of Poland and historical demography of Poland for details   Unlike in many other countries  the minority rights in Poland are guaranteed directly in the Constitution of Poland  art  35   and today there are  amongst others  sizeable German  Ukrainian and Belarusian minorities present in the country  134  After the formal collapse of Communism in 1989  Poland greatly improved its image in the world and thus has received further support from the country s recent economic success and effective entry into the structures of the European Union  Polish citizens have obtained a good reputation as workers in the united Europe  mainly due to the broad range of jobs beyond the borders of their state  since 2004  The results of an OSCE survey from 2004 showed that Poles work the second most hours per week of any nationality worldwide  Poland is remains of the most peaceful countries in the world  135  Music Main article  Music of Poland Fryderyk Chopin  composer Artists from Poland  including famous composers like Chopin or Penderecki and traditional  regionalized folk musicians  create a lively and diverse music scene  which even recognizes its own music genres  such as poezja  piewana and disco polo  As of 2006  Poland is one of the few countries in Europe where rock and hip hop dominate over pop music  while all kinds of alternative music genres are encouraged  The origins of Polish music can be traced as far back as the 13th century  manuscripts have been found in Stary S cz  containing polyphonic compositions related to the Parisian Notre Dame School  Other early compositions  such as the melody of Bogurodzica and B g si  rodzi  a coronation polonaise for Polish kings by an unknown composer   may also date back to this period  however  the first known notable composer  Miko aj z Radomia  was born and lived in the 15th century  During the 16th century  two main musical groups   both based in Krak w and belonging to the King and Archbishop of the Wawel   led to the rapid development of Polish music  Composers writing during this period include Wac aw z Szamotu   Miko aj Ziele ski  and Miko aj Gom  ka  Diomedes Cato  a native born Italian who lived in Krak w from about the age of five  became one of the most famous lutenists at the court of Sigismund III  and not only imported some of the musical styles from southern Europe  but blended them with native folk music  136  Tomasz Sta ko is a popular contemporary Polish jazz musician At the end of the 18th century  Polish classical music evolved into national forms like the polonaise  In the 19th century the most popular composers were  J zef Elsner and his pupils Fryderyk Chopin and Ignacy Dobrzy ski  Important opera composers of the era were Karol Kurpi ski and Stanis aw Moniuszko whilst the list of famous soloists and composers included Henryk Wieniawski  Juliusz Zar bski  At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries the most promiment composers could said to have been W adys aw Zele ski and Mieczys aw Kar owicz  with Karol Szymanowski gaining prominence prior to World War II  Alexandre Tansman lived in Paris but had strong connections with Poland  Henryk G recki and Krzysztof Penderecki composed in Poland  Andrzej Panufnik emigrated  Traditional Polish folk music has had a major effect on the works of many well known Polish composers  and no more so than on Fryderyk Chopin  a widely recognised national hero of the arts  All of Chopin s works involve the piano and are technically demanding  emphasising nuance and expressive depth  As a great composer  Chopin invented the musical form known as the instrumental ballade and made major innovations to the piano sonata  mazurka  waltz  nocturne  polonaise   tude  impromptu and pr lude  he was also the composer of a number of polonaises which borrowed heavily from traditional Polish folk music  It is largely thanks to him that the such pieces gained great popularity throughout Europe during the 19th century  Nowadays the most distinctive folk music can be heard in the towns and villages of the mountainous south  particularly in the region surrounding the winter resort town of Zakopane  Today Poland has a very active music scene  with the jazz and metal genres being particularly popular amongst the contemporary populace  Polish jazz musicians such as Krzysztof Komeda  created a unique style  which was most famous in 1960s and 1970s and continues to be popular to this day  Since the fall of Communism  Poland has become a major venue for large scale music festivals  chief among which are the Open er Festival  Opole Festival and Sopot Festival  Musical files of a polonaise and mazurka The polonaise is a slow dance in 3 4 time  The mazurka is a stylized folk dance in triple meter  Media Headquarters of national daily Gazeta Wyborcza in Warsaw Poland has instituted freedom of press since the fall of communism  a system under which the media was heavily politically controlled and censored  However  public TV and radio are still regulated by the government  this is exercised through an agency called Krajowa Rada Radiofonii i Telewizji  The National Radio and Television Committee   which is similar to television regulatory commissions in other developed nations  Poland has a number of major media outlets  chief amongst which are the national television channels  TVP is Poland s public broadcasting corporation  about a third of its income comes from a broadcast receiver licence  while the rest is made through revenue from commercials and sponsorships  State television operates two mainstream channels  TVP 1 and TVP 2  as well as regional programs  TVP Info  for each of the country s 16 voivodeships  In addition to these general channels  TVP runs a number of genre specific programmes such as TVP Sport  TVP Historia  TVP Kultura and TVP Seriale  there are currently plans to run channels dedicated to the coverage of political affairs  TVP Parlament  and entertainment  TVP Rozrywka   Studio set of TVP Wroc aw s  Fakty  news program Poland has a number of internationally broadcast and 24 hour news channels  chief amongst which are Polsat News  TVN 24  and TV Polonia  the latter is a state run channel dedicated to the transmission of Polish language television for the Polish diaspora abroad  There are a number of major private television outlets such as Polsat and the TVN network  Poland has a highly developed printed news industry  with daily newspapers like Gazeta Wyborcza  The Electoral Gazette  and Rzeczpospolita  The Republic  providing more traditional  intellectually stimulating reporting and tabloids such as Fakt providing more sensationalist writing which is less current affairs orientated  Rzeczpospolita is one of the nation s oldest publications still in operation today  founded in 1920  it has become a stalwart bastion of Polish reporting and in 2006 won a prestigious award for being  along with the Guardian  a British daily   the best designed newspaper in the world  137  In early 2005  Rzeczpospolita found itself at the very centre of a heated public debate  after one of its employees  the former dissident and journalist Bronis aw Wildstein  abstracted a list with the names of 240 000 informers and victims of the communist secret police from the Institute of National Remembrance and distributed it among colleagues  In the wake of the incident  Wildstein was dismissed from the paper s staff  This event represents one of the most controversial episodes in the history of the modern Polish media  which is largely due to the ongoing dispute over whether the names of communist era agents and collaborators should be disclosed or not  Major media outlets are experiencing an ongoing restructuring which is seeing many of them amalgamated into major media groups  a prime example of which is the German Axel Springer AG Publishing conglomerate s purchase of Fakt  International cooperation is also a growing trend within Polish media  TVP recently began cooperating with the French German TV network ARTE  Literature Main article  Polish literature Polish literature has a long and complicated history  During the Middle Ages most Polish authors and academics  Jan D ugosz  wrote only in Latin  as at the time  this was the  academic  language which linked Europe together  Jan Kochanowski broke this trend and became the first author to write the majority of his works in the Polish language  A number of Polish authors have won great renown in the past few centuries  however  this largely stems from the initial success of the works of Adam Mickiewicz  who wrote the first Polish epic  Pan Tadeusz  in 1834  Influential authors of the late 19th and 20th centuries include Henryk Sienkiewicz  W adys aw Reymont  Witold Gombrowicz and Czes aw Mi osz  To date four Polish authors have won the Nobel Prize in Literature  with W adys aw Reymont being one of only nine writers to receive the prestigious award for one particular  outstanding literary work  awarded for the great national epic   The Peasants  in 1924  rather than their career as a whole  138 Ferdynand Antoni Ossendowski was an internationally popular writer  Adam Mickiewicz  1798 1855  Henryk Sienkiewicz  1846 1916  W adys aw Reymont  1865 1925  Witold Gombrowicz  1904 1969  Czes aw Mi osz  1911 2004  With regard to poetry  Poland has a long and distinguished history of producing world class poets  Chief among these are the  three bards   trzej wieszcze   Mickiewicz  Krasi ski and S owacki  the three national poets of Polish Romantic literature  Incidentally  the Polish word Wieszcz means  prophet  or  soothsayer   a fitting reference for the three  as the bards were thought to not only voice Polish national sentiments but to frequently foresee the nation s future  Today the traditions of Polish literature and poetry are being carried forward by a new generation of writers  Included within this group is Wis awa Szymborska  a best selling author and recipient of the 1996 Nobel Prize in Literature  139  Architecture Further information  Category Polish architecture The Gothic St Mary s Basilica on the Main Market Square in Krak w Polish cities and towns reflect the whole spectrum of European styles  Romanesque architecture is represented by St  Andrew s Church in Krak w  and characteristic for Poland Brick Gothic by St  Mary s Church in Gda sk  Richly decorated attics and arcade loggias are the common elements of the Polish Renaissance architecture  140  141  like in City Hall in Pozna   For some time the late renaissance  so called mannerism  most notably in Bishop s Palace in Kielce  coexisted with the early baroque like in Church of SS  Peter and Paul in Krak w  Renaissance City Hall in Pozna  History has not been kind to Poland s architectural monuments  Nonetheless  a number of ancient structures had survived  castles  churches  and stately buildings  often unique in the regional or European context  Some of them have been painstakingly restored  like Wawel Castle  or completely reconstructed after being destroyed in the Second World War  including the Old Town and Royal Castle in Warsaw and the Old Town of Gda sk  The architecture of Gda sk is mostly of the Hanseatic variety  a Gothic style common amongst the former trading cities along the Baltic sea and in the northern part of Central Europe  The architectural style of Wroc aw is mainly representative of German architecture  since it was for centuries located within the German states  The centre of Kazimierz Dolny on the Vistula is a good example of a well preserved medieval town  Poland s ancient capital  Krak w  ranks among the best preserved Gothic and Renaissance urban complexes in Europe  Meanwhile  the legacy of the Kresy Marchlands of Poland s eastern regions  where Wilno and Lw w  now Vilnius and Lviv  were recognised as two major centres for the arts  played a special role in the development of Polish architecture  with Catholic church architecture deserving special note  125  In Vilnius  Lithuania  there are about 40 baroque and Renaissance churches  In Lviv  Ukraine  there are also a number of Gothic  Renaissance  and baroque religious buildings which have borrowed from and been influenced by Orthodox and Armenian church architecture  The second half of the 17th century is marked by baroque architecture  Side towers  visible in Branicki Palace in Bia ystok are typical for Polish baroque  The classical Silesian baroque is represented by the University in Wroc aw  Profuse decorations of Branicki Palace in Warsaw are characteristic of rococo style  The centre of Polish classicism was Warsaw under the rule of the last Polish king Stanis aw August Poniatowski  142  The Palace on the Water is the most notable example of Polish neoclassical architecture  Lublin Castle represents the Gothic Revival style in architecture  while the Izrael Pozna ski Palace in   d  is an example of eclecticism  Cuisine Main article  Polish cuisine Kotlet schabowy served with potatoes  Polish cuisine has influenced the cuisines of its surrounding countries  For centuries the Polish kitchen has been the arena for competing with France and Italy  It is rich in meat  especially chicken and pork  winter vegetables  cabbage in the dish bigos  and spices  Pasta is also featured in many Polish dishes  most notably are pierogi  Polish national cuisine shares some similarities with other European traditions  Generally speaking  Polish cuisine is hearty  The preparation of traditional cuisine generally is time intensive and Poles allow themselves a generous amount of time to prepare and enjoy their festive meals  with some meals  like Christmas Eve or Easter breakfast  taking a number of days to prepare in their entirety  It is worth noting that most regions of Poland have their own local gastronomic traditions and distinctive flavours  143  Notable foods in Polish cuisine include  soups   ros    barszcz   urek  krupnik  kapu niak  zupa pomidorowa  zupa og rkowa  zupa grzybowa  flaczki  tripe soup   pierogi  kie basa  go  bki  oscypek  kotlet schabowy  kotlet mielony  bigos  various potato dishes  kanapka  and many more  Traditional Polish desserts include p czki  faworki  gingerbread  babka

 ice hockey  swimming  volleyball  and weightlifting are other popular sports  The golden era of football in Poland occurred throughout the 1970s and went on until the early 1980s when the Polish national football team achieved their best results in any FIFA World Cup competitions finishing 3rd place in the 1974 and 1982 editions  The team won a gold medal in football at the 1972 Summer Olympics and also won two silver medals in 1976 and 1992  Poland  along with Ukraine  will host the UEFA European Football Championship in 2012  146  The Polish men s national volleyball team is

OICA Automobile Production 2010 18th 48 See also European Union portal NATO portal Poland portal Outline of Poland Polish American Polish migration to the United Kingdom Notes a   Numerous sources state that Polish Army was the Allies fourth biggest fighting contingent  Steven J  Zaloga and Richard Hook write that  by the war s end the Polish Army was the fourth largest contingent of the Allied coalition after the armed forces of the Soviet Union  the United States and the United Kingdom   148 Jerzy Jan Lerski writes  All in all  the Polish units  although divided and controlled by different political orientation  constituted the fourth largest Allied force  after the America  British and Soviet Armies   149 M  K  Dziewanowski has noted that  if Polish forces fighting in the east and west were added to the resistance fighters  Poland had the fourth largest Allied army in the war  after the USSR  the U S  and Britain    150  The claim of the fourth biggest Ally needs to be reconsidered  however  Throughout the war  Poland s position varied from the 2nd biggest Ally  after the fall of France  when Polish army outnumbered the French  to perhaps the 5th at the end of it  after the USA  Soviet Union  China and Britain   Please  see the analysis in Polish contribution to World War II  b   Sources vary with regards to what was the largest resistance movement during World War II  The confusion often stems from the fact that as war progressed  some resistance movements grew larger   and other diminished  Polish territories were mostly freed from Nazi German control in the years 1944 1945  eliminating the need for their respective  anti Nazi  partisan forces  in Poland  although the cursed soldiers continued to fight against the Soviets   Several sources note that Polish Armia Krajowa was the largest resistance movement in Nazi occupied Europe  Norman Davies wrote   Armia Krajowa  Home Army   the AK  which could fairly claim to be the largest of European resistance   151 Gregor Dallas wrote  Home Army  Armia Krajowa or AK  in late 1943 numbered around 400000  making it the largest resistance organization in Europe   152 Mark Wyman wrote  Armia Krajowa was considered the largest underground resistance unit in wartime Europe   153  Certainly  Polish resistance was the largest resistance till German invasion of Yugoslavia and invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941  After that point  the numbers of Soviet partisans and Yugoslav partisans begun growing rapidly  The numbers of Soviet partisans quickly caught up and were very similar to that of the Polish resistance  154  155  The numbers of Tito s Yugoslav partisans were roughly similar to those of the Polish and Soviet partisans in the first years of the war  1941 1942   but grew rapidly in the latter years  outnumbering the Polish and Soviet partisans by 2 1 or more  estimates give Yugoslavian forces about 800 000 in 1945  to Polish and Soviet forces of 400 000 in 1944   155  156
