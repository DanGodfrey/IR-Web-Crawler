United States  It is bordered by Rhode Island to the east  Massachusetts to the north  and the state of New York to the west and the south  with which it shares a water boundary in Long Island Sound   Connecticut is named for the Connecticut River  the major U S  river that approximately bisects the state  Its capital city is Hartford  Much of southern and western Connecticut  along with the majority of the state s population  is part of the New York metropolitan area  three of Connecticut s eight counties are statistically included in the New York City combined statistical area  the same area is widely referred to as the Tri State area  Connecticut s center of population is in Cheshire  New Haven County  11  which is also located within the Tri State area  Connecticut is the 3rd least extensive  the 29th most populous  and 4th most densely populated of the 50 United States  Called the Constitution State  Nutmeg State  and  The Land of Steady Habits   1  Connecticut was influential in the development of the federal government of the United States  Connecticut s first European settlers were Dutch and established a small  short lived settlement in present day Hartford at the confluence of the Park and Connecticut rivers  called Huys de Goede Hoop  Initially  half of Connecticut was a part of the Dutch colony  New Netherland  which included much of the land between the Connecticut and Delaware rivers  The first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English  Thomas Hooker led a band of followers overland from the Massachusetts Bay Colony and founded what would become the Connecticut Colony  other settlers from Massachusetts founded the Saybrook Colony and the New Haven Colony  Both the Connecticut and New Haven Colonies established documents of Fundamental Orders  considered the first constitutions in North America  In 1662  the three colonies were merged under a royal charter  making Connecticut a crown colony  This colony was one of the Thirteen Colonies that revolted against British rule in the American Revolution  The Connecticut River  Thames River  and ports along the Long Island Sound have given the state a strong maritime tradition  which continues today  Connecticut s other traditional industry is financial services  for example  insurance companies in Hartford and hedge funds in Fairfield county  As of the 2010 Census  Connecticut features the highest per capita income  Human Development Index  0 962   and median household income in the United States  12  13  14  Although Connecticut is a wealthy state by most measures  the income gap between its urban and suburban areas is striking  with several of Connecticut s cities ranking among the nation s poorest and most dangerous  15  16  Contents 1 Geography

Connecticut  Massachusetts  and New York meet  42  3  N  73  29  W   on the southern slope of Mount Frissell  whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts  17  The Connecticut River cuts through the center of the state  flowing into Long Island Sound  The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the Connecticut River Valley  Despite Connecticut s relatively small size  it features wide regional variations in its landscape  for example  in the northwestern Litchfield Hills  it features rolling mountains and horse farms  whereas in the southeastern New London County  it features beaches and maritime activities  Although Connecticut has a long maritime history  and a reputation based on that history  Connecticut has no direct access to the sea  The jurisdiction of New York actually extends east at Fishers Island  where New York shares a sea border with Rhode Island dividing Narragansett Bay  Although Connecticut has easy access to the Atlantic  between Long Island Sound and Block Island Sound  Connecticut has no direct ocean coast  Further information  List of Connecticut rivers Highest point in Connecticut on slope of Mount Frissell  as seen from Bear Mountain  Connecticut s rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities  located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London  then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford  Many towns center around a  green   such as the Litchfield Green  Lebanon Green  the largest in the state   and Wethersfield Green  the oldest in the state   Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of New England towns  such as a white church  a colonial meeting house  a colonial tavern or  inne   several colonial houses  and so on  establishing a scenic historic appearance maintained for both historic preservation and tourism  Connecticut consists of temperate broadleaf and mixed forests  Northeastern coastal forests of oaks  hickories  and maple cover much of the state  18  In the northwest  these give way to New England Acadian forests of the Taconic Mountains  18  Further information  List of Connecticut state forests The northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the distinctive Southwick Jog or Granby Notch  an approximately 2 5 mile  4 0 km  square detour into Connecticut  The actual origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which was finally concluded in 1804  when southern Southwick   whose residents sought to leave Massachusetts   was split in half  19  20  The southwestern border of Connecticut  where it abuts New York State  is marked by a panhandle in Fairfield County  containing the towns of Greenwich  Stamford  New Canaan  Darien and part of Norwalk  This irregularity in the boundary is the result of territorial disputes in the late 17th century  culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area  whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut  in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from Ridgefield to the Massachusetts border as well as undisputed claim to Rye  New York  21  Further information  Connecticut Panhandle Areas maintained by the National Park Service include  Appalachian National Scenic Trail  Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley

counties  has a borderline humid subtropical climate  sometimes statistically meeting this climate s criteria  sometimes not  with seasonal extremes tempered by proximity to the Atlantic Ocean  The city of Bridgeport  on Long Island Sound   like most other areas in metropolitan New York  typically falls within the humid subtropical climate zone under the K ppen Climate Classification system  Hartford  35 miles inland  has a humid continental climate  Consistent with its coastal reputation  Connecticut is a moderately sunny state  averaging between 2 400 and 2 800 hours of sunshine annually  23  Winters are generally considered to be cold  with average temperatures ranging from 38  F  3  C  in the maritime influenced southeast to 29  F   2  C  in the northwest in January  The average yearly snowfall is about 20 60  54 189 cm  across the state  with higher totals in the northwest  Spring has variable temperatures with frequent rainfall  Summer is hot and humid throughout the state  with average highs in New London of 81  F  27  C  and 87  F  31  C  in Windsor Locks  Fall months are mild and bring colorful foliage across the state in October and November  During hurricane season  tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region  Thunderstorms are most frequent during the summer  occurring on average 30 times annually  These storms can be severe  and the state usually averages one tornado per year  24  Connecticut s warmest temperature is 106  F  41  C  which occurred in Danbury on July 15  1995  the coldest temperature is  32  F   36  C  which occurred in

  meaning  upon the long river   28  The Connecticut region was inhabited by the Mohegan tribe prior to European colonization  The first European explorer in Connecticut was the Dutch explorer Adriaen Block  After he explored this region in 1614  Dutch fur traders sailed up the Connecticut River  then known by the Dutch as Versche Rivier    Fresh River   and built a fort at Dutch Point in what is present day Hartford  which they called  House of Hope   Dutch  Huis van Hoop   John Winthrop  then of Massachusetts  received permission to create a new colony at Old Saybrook at the mouth of the Connecticut River in 1635  This was the first of three distinct colonies that later would be combined to make up Connecticut  Saybrook Colony was a direct challenge to Dutch claims  The colony was not more than a small outpost and never matured  In 1644  the Saybrook Colony merged itself into the Connecticut Colony  The first English settlers came in 1633 and settled at Windsor  and then at Wethersfield the following year  29  However  the main body of settlers came in one large group in 1636  The settlers were Puritans from Massachusetts  led by Thomas Hooker  Hooker had been prominent in England and was a professor of theology at Cambridge  He was also an important political writer and made a significant contribution to Constitutional theory  He broke with the political leadership in Massachusetts  and  just as Roger Williams created a new polity in Rhode Island  Hooker and his cohort did the same and established the Connecticut Colony at Hartford in 1636  This was the second of the three colonies  The third colony was founded in March 1638  New Haven Colony  originally known as the Quinnipiack Colony  was established by John Davenport  Theophilus Eaton  and others at New Haven  The New Haven Colony had its own constitution   The Fundamental Agreement of the New Haven Colony   which was signed on June 4  1639  Because the Dutch were outnumbered by the flood of English settlers from Massachusetts  they left their fort in 1654  Neither the establishment of the Connecticut Colony or the Quinnipiack Colony was carried out with the sanction of the English Crown  and they were independent political entities  They naturally were presumptively English  but in a legal sense  they were only secessionist outposts of Massachusetts Bay  In 1662  Winthrop took advantage of this void in political affairs and obtained in England the charter by which the colonies of Connecticut and Quinnipiack were united  Although Winthrop s charter favored the Connecticut colony  New Haven remained a seat of government with Hartford until after the American Revolution  Winthrop was very politically astute and secured the charter from the newly restored Charles II  who granted the most liberal political terms  Historically important colonial settlements included  Windsor  1633  Wethersfield  1634  Saybrook  1635  Hartford  1636  New Haven  1638  Fairfield  1639  Guilford  1639  Milford  1639  Stratford  1639  Farmington  1640  Stamford  1641  New London  1646  Its first constitution  the  Fundamental Orders   was adopted on January 14  1639  while its current constitution  the third for Connecticut  was adopted in 1965  Connecticut is the fifth of the original 13 states  The original constitutions influenced the US Constitution as one of the leading authors was Roger Sherman of New Haven  The western boundaries of Connecticut have been subject to change over time  According to the Hartford Treaty with the Dutch  signed on September 19  1650  but never ratified by the British  the western boundary of Connecticut ran north from Greenwich Bay for a distance of 20 miles 30  31   provided the said line come not within 10 miles  16 km   16 km  of Hudson River  This agreement was observed by both sides until war erupted between England and The Netherlands in 1652  No other limits were found  Conflict over uncertain colonial limits continued until the Duke of York captured New Netherland in 1664   30  31  On the other hand  Connecticut s original Charter in 1662 granted it all the land to the  South Sea   i e  the Pacific Ocean  32  33  Most colonial royal grants were for long east west strips  Connecticut took its grant seriously  and established a ninth county between the Susquehanna and Delaware Rivers  named Westmoreland County  This resulted in the brief Pennamite Wars with Pennsylvania  Connecticut s lands also extended across northern Ohio  called the Western Reserve lands  The Western Reserve section was settled largely by people from Connecticut  and they brought Connecticut place names to Ohio  Agreements with Pennsylvania and New York extinguished the land claims by Connecticut within its neighbors  creating the Connecticut Panhandle  The Western Reserve lands were relinquished to the federal government  which brought the state to its present boundaries other than minor adjustments with Massachusetts   edit  Demographics

population of Connecticut was 3 580 709 on July 1  2011  a 0 18  increase since the 2010 United States Census  7  As of 2005  Connecticut has an estimated population of 3 510 297  37  which is an increase of 11 331  or 0 3   from the prior year and an increase of 104 695  or 3 1   since the year 2000  This includes a natural increase since the last census of 67 427 people  that is 222 222 births minus 154 795 deaths  and an increase due to net migration of 41 718 people into the state  Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 75 991 people  and migration within the country produced a net loss of 34 273 people  Based on the 2005 estimates  Connecticut moves from the 29th most populous state to 30th  37  6 6  of its population was reported as being under 5 years old  24 7  under 18 years old  and 13 8  were 65 years of age or older  Females made up approximately 51 6  of the population  with 48 4  male  In 1790  97  of the population in Connecticut was classified as  rural   The first census in which less than half the population was classified as rural was 1890  In the 2000 census  it was only 12 3   Most of western and southern Connecticut  particularly the Gold Coast  is strongly associated with New York City  this area is the most affluent and populous region of the state  Eastern Connecticut is more culturally influenced by the greater New England area  including the cities of Boston and Providence  The center of population of Connecticut is located in the town of Cheshire  38   edit  Race  ancestry  and language

England s largest Protestant Church  The First Cathedral in Bloomfield  Connecticut located in Hartford County  Hartford is seat to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hartford  which is sovereign over the Diocese of Bridgeport and the Diocese of Norwich   edit  Economy Connecticut state welcome sign  Entering Enfield  CT  Entering the Merritt Parkway from New York  Entering Greenwich  CT  The total gross state product for 2010 was  237 billion  44  The per capita income for 2007 was  54 117  ranking first among the states  45  There is  however  a great disparity in incomes throughout the state  although New Canaan has one of the highest per capita incomes in America  Hartford is one of the ten cities with the lowest per capita incomes in America  As with Bridgeport  New Haven and other cities in the state  Hartford is surrounded by wealthier suburbs  The state s unemployment rate in August 2011 was 9 0   46  New Canaan is the wealthiest town in Connecticut  with a per capita income of  85 459  Darien  Greenwich  Weston  Westport and Wilton also have per capita incomes over  65 000  Hartford is the poorest municipality in Connecticut  with a per capita income of  13 428 in 2000  47  There are other lower income and blue collar towns  mostly parts of towns  in the eastern part of the State   edit  Taxation Prior to 1991  Connecticut had an investment only income tax system  Income from employment was untaxed  but income from investments was taxed at 13   the highest rate in the U S   with no deductions allowed for costs of producing the investment income  such as interest on borrowing  In 1991  under Governor Lowell P  Weicker  Jr   an Independent  the system was changed to one in which the taxes on employment income and investment income were equalized at a maximum rate of 4   Since then  Greenwich  Connecticut  has become the headquarters for a large number of America s largest hedge funds  As of 2011  the income tax rates on Connecticut individuals are divided into six tax brackets of 3   5   5 5   6   6 5  and 6 7   48  All wages of Connecticut residents are subject to the state s income tax  even if earned outside the state  However  in those cases  Connecticut income tax must be withheld only to the extent the Connecticut tax exceeds the amount withheld by the other jurisdiction  Since New York and Massachusetts have higher tax rates than Connecticut  this effectively means that Connecticut residents that work in those states have no Connecticut income tax withheld  Connecticut permits a credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions  but since residents who work in other states are still subject to Connecticut income taxation  they may owe taxes if the jurisdictional credit does not fully offset the Connecticut tax amount  Connecticut levies a 6 35  state sales tax on the retail sale  lease  or rental of most goods  48  Some items and services in general are not subject to sales and use taxes unless specifically enumerated as taxable by statute  A provision excluding clothing under  50 from sales tax was repealed as of July 1  2011  48  There are no additional sales taxes imposed by local jurisdictions  During the summer  there is one week during which sales tax on certain items and quantities of clothing is not imposed in order to assist those with children returning to school  citation needed  All real and personal property located within the state of Connecticut is taxable unless specifically exempted by statute  All assessments are at 70  of fair market value  Another 20  of the value may be taxed by the local government though  The maximum property tax credit is  500 per return and any excess may not be refunded or carried forward  49  Connecticut does not levy an intangible personal property tax  According to the Tax Foundation  the 2010 Census data shows Connecticut residents paying the 2nd highest average property taxes in the nation with only New Jersey ahead of them  50   edit  Real estate Homes in Connecticut vary widely with a median price of approximately  226 000  By contrast  the median value for a home in Fairfield County  for example  is about  370 000  51  52  Connecticut has the most multi million dollar homes in the Northeast  and the second most in the nation after California  with 3 3  of homes in Connecticut priced over  1 million in 2003  53   edit  Industries The agricultural produce of the state includes nursery stock  eggs  clams and lobster  shellfish   dairy products  cattle  and tobacco  Its industrial output includes transportation equipment  especially helicopters  aircraft parts  and nuclear submarines  heavy industrial machinery and electrical equipment  military weaponry  fabricated metal products  chemical and pharmaceutical products  and scientific instruments  Due to the prominence of the aircraft industry in the state  Connecticut has an official state aircraft  the F4U Corsair  and an official Connecticut Aviation Pioneer  Igor Sikorsky  The state officially recognizes aircraft designer Gustav Whitehead as  Father of Connecticut Aviation  for his research into powered flight in Bridgeport  Connecticut in 1901  two years before the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk  North Carolina  54  Governor John Dempsey also declared August 15 to be  Gustave Whitehead Day   55  A report issued by the Connecticut Commission on Culture  amp  Tourism on December 7  2006  demonstrated that the economic impact of the arts  film  history and tourism generated more than  14 billion in economic activity and 170 000 jobs annually  This provides  9 billion in personal income for Connecticut residents and  1 7 billion in state and local revenue  56  As of November 2010  the state s unemployment rate is

Turnpike  running southwest to northeast along the coast  I 84 running southwest to northeast in the center of the state  I 91 running north to south in the center of the state  and I 395 running north to south near the eastern border of the state  The other major highways in Connecticut are the Merritt Parkway and Wilbur Cross Parkway  which together form State Route 15  running from the Hutchinson River Parkway in New York State parallel to I 95 before turning north of New Haven and running parallel to I 91  finally becoming a surface road in Berlin  Connecticut  Route 15 and I 95 were originally toll roads  they relied on a system of toll plazas at which all traffic stopped and paid fixed tolls  A series of terrible crashes at these plazas eventually contributed to the decision to remove the tolls in 1988  58  Other major arteries in the state include U S  Route 7 in the west running parallel to the NY border  State Route 8 farther east near the industrial city of Waterbury and running north south along the Naugatuck River Valley nearly parallel with U S  7  and State Route 9 in the east  See List of State Routes in Connecticut for an overview of the state s highway system  Between New Haven and the New York City  I 95 is one of the most congested highways in the United States  Many people now drive longer distances to work in the New York City area  This strains the three lanes of traffic capacity  resulting in lengthy rush hour delays  Frequently  the congestion spills over to clog the parallel Merritt Parkway  The state has encouraged traffic reduction schemes  including rail use and ride sharing  59  Connecticut also has a very active bicycling community  with one of the highest rates of bicycling ownership and use in the United States  New Haven s cycling community  organized in a local advocacy group called ElmCityCycling  is particularly active  According to the U S  Census 2006 American Community Survey  New Haven has the highest percentage of commuters who bicycle to work of any major metropolitan center on the East Coast   edit  Public transportation A Metro North Railroad New Haven Line train at Stamford   edit  Rail Southwestern Connecticut is served by MTA s Metro North Railroad New Haven Line  providing commuter service to New York City and New Haven  with branches servicing New Canaan  Danbury  and Waterbury  Connecticut lies along Amtrak s Northeast Corridor which features frequent Northeast Regional and Acela Express service  Towns between New Haven and New London are also served by the Shore Line East commuter line  Operation of commuter trains from New Haven to Springfield on Amtrak s New Haven Springfield Line is under consideration  60  Amtrak also operates a shuttle service between New Haven and Springfield  Massachusetts  servicing Hartford and other towns on the corridor   edit  Bus Statewide bus service is supplied by Connecticut Transit  owned by the Connecticut Department of

Connecticut is known as the  Constitution State   While the origin on this title is uncertain  the nickname is assumed to refer to the Fundamental Orders of 1638 39  These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal government written by a representative body in Connecticut  The government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of Connecticut Constitutional History  After the Fundamental Orders  Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King Charles II of England through the Connecticut Charter of 1662  Separate branches of government did not exist during this period  and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority  A constitution similar to the modern U S  Constitution was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818  Finally  the current state constitution was implemented in 1965  The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor  but incorporated a handful of important modifications  Another possible source of the nickname  constitution state  comes from Connecticut s pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787  during which Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth helped to orchestrate what became known as the Connecticut Compromise  or the Great Compromise  This plan combined the Virginia Plan and the New Jersey Plan to form a bicameral legislature  a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution   edit  Executive The governor heads the executive branch  Dan Malloy is the current Governor and Nancy Wyman is the Lieutenant Governor  both are Democrats  Malloy  the former mayor of Stamford  won the 2010 general election for Governor  and was sworn in on January 5  2011  From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution  the governor presided over the General Assembly  In 1974  Ella Grasso was elected as the governor of Connecticut  This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first  There are several executive departments  Administrative Services  Agriculture  Banking  Children and Families  Consumer Protection  Correction

executive officers named in the state constitution that are elected directly by voters  Secretary of the State  Treasurer  Comptroller and Attorney General  All executive officers are elected to four year terms  63   edit  Legislative The legislature is the General Assembly  The General Assembly is a bicameral body consisting of an upper body  the State Senate  36 senators   and a lower body  the House of Representatives  151 representatives   63  Bills must pass each house in order to become law  The governor can veto the bill  but this veto can be overridden by a two thirds majority in each house  Senators and representatives  all of whom must be at least 18 years of age  are elected to two year terms in November on even numbered years  The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senate  except when absent from the chamber  when the President pro tempore presides  The Speaker of the House presides over the House  Chris Donovan is the current Speaker of the House of Connecticut

judicial branch is the Connecticut Supreme Court  headed by the Chief Justice of Connecticut  The Supreme Court is responsible for deciding on the constitutionality of the law or cases as they relate to the law  Its proceedings are similar to those of the United States Supreme Court  with no testimony given by witnesses  and the lawyers of the two sides each present oral arguments no longer than thirty minutes  Following a court proceeding  the court may take several months to arrive at a judgment  The current Chief Justice is Chase T  Rogers  In 1818  the court became a separate entity  independent of the legislative and executive branches  65  The Appellate Court is a lesser state wide court and the Superior Courts are lower courts that resemble county courts of other states   edit
