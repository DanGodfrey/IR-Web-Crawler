a controversial issue  having many competing definitions  models  and even disagreements over its very existence  1  Many Americans believe in a simple three class model that includes the  rich   the  middle class   and the  poor   More complex models that have been proposed describe as many as a dozen class levels  2  3  while still others deny the very existence  in the European sense  of  social class  in American society  4  Most definitions of class structure group people according to wealth  income  education  type of occupation  and membership in a specific subculture or social network  Sociologists Dennis Gilbert  William Thompson  Joseph Hickey  and James Henslin have proposed class systems with six distinct social classes  These class models feature an upper or capitalist class consisting of the rich and powerful  an upper middle class consisting of highly educated and affluent professionals  a middle class consisting of college educated individuals employed in white collar industries  a lower middle class  a working class constituted by clerical and blue collar workers whose work is highly routinized  and a lower class divided between the working poor and the unemployed

Some academics consider American society sociologically and economically fragmented in such a manner that no clear class distinctions can be made  This means that there are no pronounced breaks in socioeconomic strata  which makes class division highly subjective and disputable  1  Others  such as sociologist Dennis Gilbert  dispute the concept of a well mixed society  and claim that distinct social networks can be identified for each class  W  Lloyd Warner also asserts the existence of class markers    We are proud of those facts of American life that fit the pattern we are taught but somehow we are often ashamed of those equally important social facts which demonstrate the presence of social class  Consequently  we tend to deny them  or worse  denounce them and by doing so we tend to deny their existence and magically make them disappear from consciousness     W  Lloyd Warner  What Social Class Is In America 4  Warner asserts that social class is as old as civilization itself and has been present in nearly every society from before the Roman Empire  through medieval times  and to the modern day United States  He believes that complex societies such as the United States need an equally complex social hierarchy  4   edit  Markers Class in the U S   featuring occupational descriptions by Thompson  amp  Hickey as well as U S  Census Bureau data pertaining to personal income and educational attainment for those age 25 or older  Some definitions of class look only at numerical measures such as wealth or income  Others take into account qualitative factors  such as education  culture  and social status  There is no consensus on which of these variables is essential and which are merely common correlates  It is also disputed whether sharp lines can be drawn  one point of view in the debate    A stratified society is one marked by inequality  by differences among people that are regarded as being higher or lower   it is logically possible for a society to be stratified in a continuous gradation between high and low without any sharp lines   in reality   there is only a limited number of types of occupations    People in similar positions   grow similar in their thinking and lifestyle   they form a pattern  and this pattern creates social class     Dennis Gilbert  The American Class Structure  1998 2   edit  Social status   It is impossible to understand people s behavior   without the concept of social stratification  because class position has a pervasive influence on almost everything   the clothes we wear   the television shows we watch   the colors we paint our homes in and the names we give our pets    Our position in the social hierarchy affects our health  happiness  and even how long we will live     William Thompson  Joseph Hickey  Society in Focus  2005 5  Social class is sometimes presented as a description of how members of the society have sorted themselves along a continuum of positions varying in importance  influence  prestige  and compensation  In these models  certain occupations are considered to be desirable and influential  while others are considered to be menial  repetitive  and unpleasant   In some cases  non occupational roles such as a parent or volunteer mentor  are also considered  5   Generally  the higher the ranking on such a scale  the higher the skill and education levels required to perform it  Some sociologists consider the higher income and prestige of higher ranked jobs to simply be incentives to encourage members of society to obtain the skills necessary to perform important work  7  This is an important mechanism in the economic theory of capitalism  and is compatible with the notion that class is mutable and determined by a combination of choices and opportunities  In other cases  class or status is inherited  For example  being the son or daughter of a wealthy individual  may carry a higher status and different cultural connotations than being a member of nouveau riche   new money    Those taking the functionalist approach to sociology and economics view social classes as components essential for the survival of complex societies such as American society  5   edit  Income Main articles  Personal income in the United States and Household income in the United States Median income levels Households Persons  age 25 or older with earnings

000 and up  250 000 and up  350 000 and up Source  US Census Bureau  2006  income statistics for the year 2005 Income in the United States is most commonly measured by U S  Census Bureau in terms of either household or individual and remains one of the most prominent indicators of class status  As 82  of all households  16  of those in the top quintiles  had two income earners the discrepancy between household and personal income is quite considerable  In 2005 the top 95  of income earners made  12 500 or more  while 18  of households had incomes over  100 000  Personal income is largely the result of scarcity  As individuals who hold higher status positions tend to possess rare skills or assume positions society deems very essential  have higher incomes  citation needed  Overall the median household income was  46 326 in 2005 8  while the median personal income  including only those above the age of 25  was  32 140  9  Per capita household income  the income a household is able to allocate to each member of the household is also an important variable in determining a given household s standard of living  A high household income may be offset by a large household size  thus  resulting in a low per capita household income  2  In 2005  the median household income per capita was  24 672  8    It should be stressed   that a position does not bring power and prestige because it draws a high income  Rather  it draws a high income because it is functionally important and the available personnel are for one reason or another scarce  It is therefore superficial and erroneous to regard high income as the cause of a man s power and prestige  just as it is erroneous to think that a man s fever is the cause of his disease    The economic source of power and prestige is not income primarily  but the ownership of capital goods  including patents  good will  and professional reputation   Such ownership should be distinguished from the possession of consumers  goods  which is an index rather than a cause of social standing     Kingsley Davis and Wilbert E  Moore  Principles of Stratification As mentioned above  income is one of the most prominent features of social class  it is not one of its causes  In other words  income does not determine the status of an individual or household but rather reflects on that status  Some say that income and prestige are the incentives provided by society in order to fill needed positions with the most qualified and motivated personnel possible  7  However such a conclusion is contrary to the widespread observation clarification needed antecdotal  that upper management at many companies is less knowledgeable and competent than many of their underlings  and that their positions are largely the result of fortuitous birth situations and networking  This situation is lampooned in the popular social commentary comic strip  Dilbert   The New York Times has used income quintiles to define class  It has assigned the quintiles from lowest to highest as lower class  lower middle class  middle class  upper middle class  and upper class  10  These definitions equate class with income  permitting people to move from class to class as their income changes   edit  Dual income controversy Percentage of 2  income households in each of the quintiles  1 5 of the population   11  Income is one of the most commonly used attributes of a household to determine its class status  The relationship between income  which mostly arises from the scarcity of a certain skill  may however  prove to be more complex than initially perceived  7  While the idea is that income reflects status  household income may just be the product of two or more incomes  In 2005  22  of American households had two income earners  The vast majority  97   of households in the top quintile had two or more income earners  This means that the majority of household income in the top quintile are the result of two income earners pooling their resources  establishing a close link between perceived affluence and the number of income earners in a given household  6  11  This raises the question of whether or not the combination of incomes results in higher social status  Of course  there is no definite answer as class is a vague sociological concept  5    The parade of income earners with height representing income suggest that the relationship between the distribution of income and the class structure is    blurred in the middle    we saw dual income working class marchers looking down on single income upper middle class marchers  In sum  the class structure as we have defined it    does not exactly match the distribution of household income     Dennis Gilbert  The American Class Structure  1998 2  Sociologist Dennis Gilbert states that it is possible for households to out earn other households over higher class standing through increasing their number of income earners  He furthermore states that household size also played an essential role  as the standard of living for two persons living off one upper middle class personal income may very well be higher than that of a household with four members living off two working class personal incomes  2  The combination of two or more incomes  allow for households to increase their income substantially without moving higher on the occupational ladder or attaining higher educational degrees  Thus it is important to remember that the favorable economic position of households in the top two quintiles is in some cases the result of combined income  rather than demand for a single worker  11   edit  Education Main article  Educational attainment in the United States Educational attainment is related to both occupation  as seen above  and income  This graph shows the educational attainment of individuals age 25 64  employed full time  by occupational field  12  Tertiary education  or  higher education   is required for many middle class professions  depending on how the term middle class is to be defined  Tertiary education is rarely free  but the costs vary widely  tuition at elite private colleges often exceeds  200 000 for a four year program  On the other hand  public colleges and universities typically charge much less  for state residents   and many  such as the University of California system  rival the elite private schools in reputation and quality  Also  scholarships offered by universities and government do exist  and low interest loans are available  Still  the average cost of education  by all accounts  is increasing  The attainment of post secondary and graduate degrees is the perhaps most important feature of a middle and upper middle class person with the university being regarded as the most essential institution and gatekeeper of the professional middle class  5  13 Educational attainment is also directly linked to income  In 2005  the vast majority of those with doctorate and professional degrees were among the nation s top 15  of income earners  14  Those with bachelor degrees had incomes considerably above the national median while the median income for those with some college education remained near the national median  According to U S  Census Bureau  9  of persons aged 25 or older had a graduate degree  27 9  had a Bachelor s degree or more with 53  having attended college  14  15  With 85  of the population having graduated high school  it becomes apparent that the average American does not have a college degree  but is likely to have attended college for some time and has graduated high school  Overall  educational attainment serves as the perhaps most essential class feature of most Americans  being directly linked to income and occupation  16

their offspring  5  Due to class mobility individuals may also acculturate to the culture of another class when ascending or descending in the social order  However  one does need to remember that all social classes in the United States  except the upper class  consist of tens of millions of people  Thus social classes form social groups so large that they feature considerable diversity within and any statement regarding a given social class  culture needs to be seen as a broad generalization  Since 1970  sociologists Paula LeMasters and Melvin Kohl have set out repeatedly to research class based cultures  Class culture has been shown to have a strong influence on the mundane lives of people  affecting everything from the manner in which they raise their children  initiation and maintenance of romantic relationship to the color in which they paint their houses  5  The strongest cultural differences seem to run along the professional middle class working class divide  citation needed  A recent increase in residential class segregation and the overall tendency of individual to associate mostly with those of equal standing as themselves has further strengthened class differences  2  18  Parental views are the perhaps most essential factor in determining the socialization process which shapes new members of society  5  The values and standards used in child rearing are commonly closely related to the parent s occupational status  2  Parents from the professional class tend to raise their children to become curious independent thinkers  while working class parents raise their children to have a more communal perspective with a strong respect for authority  2  Middle class parents tend to emphasize internal standards and values while working class parents emphasize external values  2  Sociologist Dennis Gilbert uses a list of values identified by Melvin Kohn to be typical of the professional middle and working class  Middle class parents values for their children and themselves included   Consideration of Others  Self Control  Curiosity  Happiness  Honesty  Tolerance of Nonconformity  Open to Innovation    Self Direction   This contrasted with surveyed working class individuals  who reported   Manners  Obedience    Neatness  Cleanliness  Strong Punishment of Deviant Behavior  Stock to Old Ways  People not Trustworthy    Strict Leadership  as values for themselves and their children  There is a strong correlation between these values and the occupational activities of the respondents  The job characteristics of middle class respondents included   Work Independently  Varied Tasks  Work with People or Data   versus working class parents of reported  Close Supervision and Repetitive Work     2    Not once in a professional middle class home did I see a young boy shake his father s hand in a well taught manly gesture    Not once did I hear a middle class parent scornfully or even sympathetically call a crying boy a sissy or in any way reprimand him for his tears    even as young as six or seven  the working class boys seemed more emotionally controlled more like miniature men than those in the middle class families     Sociologist Lillian Rubin in Gilbert  1998 Gender roles are also viewed differently by those in the higher and lower social classes  Middle class individuals  who were more open towards  nonconformity  and emphasized individual self direction as well as critical thinking  were also less stringent in their application of gender roles  Working class individuals  on the other hand  emphasized gender roles  While working class people have more and more assimilated to middle class culture regarding their view and application of gender roles  differences remain  Professional class people are more likely to have an egalitarian distribution of work in their household with both spouses being equals in heterosexual marriages  According to Dennis Gilbert   College life  generally a prologue to upper middle class careers  delays marriage and encourages informal  relatively egalitarian association between men and women   2  6   edit  Academic models The following are reported

Colins   edit  Upper class Further information  American upper class This term is applied to a wide array of elite groups existing in the United States of America    The term commonly includes the so called  blue bloods   multi generational wealth combined with leadership of high society  such as the Astor or Roosevelt families  There is disagreement over whether the  nouveau riche  should be included as members of the upper class or whether this term should exclusively be used for established families  Twentieth century sociologist W  Lloyd Warner divided the upper class into two sections  the  upper upper class   or bourgeoisie  and  lower upper class   or  scoobs    The former includes established upper class families while the latter includes those with great wealth  As there is no defined lower threshold for the upper class it is difficult  if not outright impossible  to determine the exact number or percentage of American households that could be identified as being members of the upper class es   Income and wealth statistics may serve as a helpful guideline as they can be measured in a more objective manner  In 2005  approximately one and a half percent  1 5   of households in the United States had incomes exceeding  250 000 with the top 5  having incomes exceeding  157 000  19  Furthermore only 2 6  of households held assets  excluding home equity  of more than one million dollars  One could therefore fall under the assumption that less than five percent of American society are members of rich households  The richest 1  of the American population owns as much as the combined wealth of the bottom 90   20  or perhaps even more  21  Members of the upper class control and own significant portions of the corporate America and may exercise indirect power through the investment of capital  The high salaries and the potential for amassing great wealth through stock options have greatly increased for the power and visibility of the  corporate elite   Many sociologists and commentators  however  make a distinction between the upper class  in the sense of those in the families of inherited wealth  and the corporate elite  By implication  the upper class is held in lower regard  as inheritors of idle wealth  than the self made millionaires in prestigious occupations  22  Yet another important feature of the upper class is that of inherited privilege  While most Americans  including those in the upper middle class need to actively maintain their status  upper class persons do not need to work in order to maintain their status  Status tends to be passed on from generation to generation without each generation having to re certify its status  13  Overall  the upper class is the financially best compensated and one of the most influential socio economic classes in American society   edit  Corporate elite The high salaries and  especially  the potential wealth through stock options  has supported the term corporate elite  Top executives  including Chief Executive Officers  are among the financially best compensated occupations in the United States  The median annual earnings for a CEO in the United States were  140 350 23   exceeding the income of more than 90  of U S  households   The Wall Street Journal reports the median compensation for CEOs of 350 major corporations was  6 000 000 in 2005 with most of the money coming from stock options  24  In New York City in 2005  the median income  including bonuses  of a corporate  chief operating officer   the No  2 job  was  377 000  25  The total compensation for a  top IT officer  in charge of information technology in New York City was  218 000  26  Thus even below the CEO level of top corporations  financial compensation will usually be sufficient to propel a households with a mere one income earner in the top 1   In 2005 only 1 5  of American households had incomes above  250 000 with many reaching this level only through having two income earners  27  28  29    Top executives are among the highest paid workers in the U S  economy  However  salary levels vary substantially depending on the level of managerial responsibility  length of service  and type  size  and location of the firm  For example  a top manager in a very large corporation can earn significantly more than a counterpart in a small firm  Median annual earnings of general and operations managers in May 2004 were  77 420  The middle 50  earned between  52 420 and  118 310  Because the specific responsibilities of general and operations managers vary significantly within industries  earnings also tend to vary considerably   the median annual earnings of chief executives in May 2004 were  140 350  although chief executives in some industries earned considerably more   the median income of chief executive officers in the nonprofit sector was  88 006 in 2005  but some of the highest chief executives made more than  700 000     U S  Department of Labor  citation needed  Many politically powerful people make money before coming to office  but in general the political power elite have official incomes in the  150 000 to  185 000 range  members of Congress are paid  174 000  and are effectively required to have a residence in their district as well as one in Washington  30   edit  Upper middle Further information  American middle class The Professional Managerial middle class The upper middle class consists of highly educated salaried professionals whose work is largely self directed  Many have advanced graduate degrees and household incomes commonly exceed the high five figure range  Members of this class commonly value higher education   most holding advanced academic degrees   and are often involved with personal and professional networks including professional organizations  The upper middle class tends to have great influence over the course of society  2  Occupations which require high educational attainment  are well compensated and are held in high public esteem such as physicians  lawyers  engineers  scientists and professors are largely considered to be upper middle class  13  The very well educated are seen as trend setters with movements such as the anti smoking movement  pro fitness movement  organic food movement  and environmentalism being largely indigenous to this particular socio economic grouping  Education serves as perhaps the most important value and also the most dominant entry barrier of the upper middle class  5  18  Sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert  Willam Thompson  and Joseph Hickey estimate the upper middle class to constitute roughly 15  of the population  or roughly three in every twenty persons   The main hallmark and most distinguishing feature of this class is its high educational attainment   edit  Middle class Main article  American middle class The middle class is perhaps the mostly vaguely defined of the social classes  3  The term can be used either to describe a relative elite of professionals and managers 13    also called the upper middle class   or it can be used to describe those in between the extremes of wealth  disregarding considerable differences in income  culture  educational attainment  influence  and occupation  As with all social classes in the U S   there are no definite answers as to what is and what is not middle class  Sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert  James Henslin  William Thompson  and Joseph Hickey have brought forth class models in which the middle class is divided into two sections that combined constitute 47  to 49  of the population  The upper middle or professional class constitutes the upper end of the middle class which consists of highly educated  well paid professionals with considerable work autonomy  The lower end of the middle class   called either lower middle class or just middle class   consists of semi professionals  craftsmen  office staff  and sales employees who often have college degrees and are very loosely supervised  2  5  6    Everyone wants to believe they are middle class  For people on the bottom and the top of the wage scale the phrase connotes a certain Regular Joe cachet  But this eagerness to be part of the group has led the definition to be stretched like a bungee cord     Dante Chinni  the Christian Science Monitor   31  Although income thresholds cannot be determined since social classes lack distinct boundaries and tend to overlap  sociologists and economists have put forward certain income figures they find indicative of middle class households  Sociologist Leonard Beeghley identifies a husband making roughly  57 000 and a wife making roughly  40 000 with a household income of roughly  97 000 as a typical middle class family  32  Sociologists William Thompson and Joseph Hickey identify household incomes between  35 000 and  75 000 as typical for the lower middle and  100 000 or more as typical for the upper middle class  5  Though it needs to be noted that household income distribution neither reflects standard of living nor class status with complete accuracy  2   edit  Traditional middle class Further information  Average Joe and American middle class Statistical middle class Many primary and secondary level teachers in the United states are in the middle class  Those households more or less at the center of society may be referred to as being part of the American middle or middle middle class in vernacular language use  In the academic models featured in this article  however  the middle class does not constitute a strong majority of the population  Those in the middle of the socio economic strata the proverbial Average Joe are commonly in the area where the working and lower middle class overlap  The most prominent academic models split the middle class into two sections  Yet  it remains common for the term middle class to be applied for anyone in between either extreme of the socio economic strata  The middle class is then often sub divided into an upper middle  middle middle  and lower middle class  In colloquial descriptions of the class system the middle middle class may described as consisting of those in the middle of the social strata  Politicians and television personalities such as Lou Dobbs can be seen using the term middle class in this manner  especially when discussing the middle class squeeze  3  33  The wide discrepancy between the academic models and public opinions that lump highly educated professionals together in the same class with secretaries  may lead to the conclusion that public opinion on the subject has become largely ambiguous  2   edit  Lower middle class The lower middle class is  as the name implies  generally defined as those less privileged than the middle class  People in this class commonly work in supporting occupations  Although they seldom hold advanced academic degrees  a college degree  usually a bachelor s degree  is almost always required for entry into the lower middle class  Sociologists Dennis Gilbert  William Thompson  and Joseph Hickey  however  only divide the middle class into two groups  In their class modes the middle class only consists of an upper and lower middle class  The upper middle class  as described above  constitutes roughly 15  of the population with highly educated white collar professionals who commonly have salaries in the high 5 figure range and household incomes in the low six figure range  Semi professionals with Bachelor s degrees and some college degrees constitute the lower middle class  Their class models show the lower middle class positioned slightly above the middle of the socio economic strata  Those in blue  and pink collar as well as clerical occupations are referred to as working class in these class models  2  5   edit  Working class The term working class applies to those that work at this tier in the social hierarchy  Definitions of this term vary greatly  While Lloyd Warner found the vast majority of the American population to be in either the upper lower class or lower lower class in 1949  modern day experts such as Michael Zweig  an economist for SUNY Stony Brook  argue that the working class constitutes most of the population  34  Dennis Gilbert places 13  of households among the  working poor  with 12  being in the  underclass   Thompson  amp  Hickey place roughly 17  to 20  of households in the lower classes  The lower classes constituting roughly a fifth to a quarter of American society consists mainly of low rung retail and service workers as well as the frequently unemployed and those not able to work  2  5  6  Overall  13  of the population fall below the poverty threshold  Hunger and food insecurity were present in the lives of 3 9  of American households  while roughly twenty five million Americans  ca  9   participated in the food stamp program  35   edit  Agriculture Further information  Agricultural history of the United States  and Social class in American history  edit  Farmworkers Before industrialization   yeoman farmers  self sufficient  politically independent landowners made up a large portion of the country s population  Jeffersonian democracy and Jacksonian democracy successfully expanded the political rights of the yeomen  and the geographical extent of the nation to provide them farms  This culminated in the Homestead Act of 1862 which provided hundreds of thousands of free farms  Before 1865 large southern plantations used slaves  After emancipation  a system of sharecropping and tenant farming for both whites and blacks in the South provided a semi independent status for farmers who did not own their land  In contemporary times  migrant agricultural workers mostly Mexicans perform field and packing work  36   edit  Farmers Only 0 7  of the population of the United States is employed in the agricultural sector  37  Most are proprietors of independent farms  Once the dominant American social class  this group diminished in overall numbers during the 20th century  as farm holdings grew more consolidated  farming operations became more mechanized  and most of the population migrated to urban areas  2  Today  the agricultural sector has essentially taken on the characteristics of business and industry generally  In contemporary usage  a  farmer  is someone who owns and operates a farm  which more often than not will be a sizable business enterprise   agricultural workers  or  farm workers   who perform the actual work associated with farming  typically come out of the lower classes  indeed  they are often near destitute immigrants or migrant farm workers  In this respect  farming mirrors big business  like any enterprise  a farm has owners  who may be a family or a corporation   salaried managers  supervisors  foremen and workers  With the number of farms steadily diminishing  the stereotypical humble homestead is increasingly the exception  for viable farming now means agribusiness  the large amounts of capital required to operate a competitive farm require large scale organization  The large landowners in California s Central Valley  Coachella Valley and Imperial Valley fall squarely within the upper class  Among farmers   income  in the conventional sense is not an accurate standard of wealth measurement  because farmers typically keep their official income low by placing their assets into farming corporations rather than drawing the money directly  The stereotypical poor  marginal farmer  eking out a living  from the soil  an image deeply ingrained in most Americans  minds by folklore  films  and even history texts  has now been largely displaced by agribusiness  which has bought them out and consolidated their holdings  38   edit  Class mobility Class ascendancy namely that each successive generation will have a higher standard of living than its predecessor is a central theme in American literature and culture and plays a key role in the American dream  While social class in the United States is thought to be largely based on achievement  climbing the social ladder is more difficult for those born into less advantageous positions  5  13  Occupation  perhaps the most important class component   educational attainment  and income can be increased through a lifetime  However  factors such as wealth inheritance and local education system which often provides lower quality education to those in poor school districts 39  may make rising out of poverty a challenge  Class mobility in the United States decreased between the 1970s and the 1990s  40

Further information  Household income in the United States  Personal income in the United States  Educational attainment in the United States  and Investment theory of politics A study by Larry Bartels found a positive correlation between Senate votes and opinions of high income people  conversely  low income people had a negative correlation with senate votes  41  Income remains one of the main indicators of class  as it commonly reflects high educational attainment as well as a prestigious occupation  7  A discrepancy in the political attitudes can be found among individuals residing in households with differing incomes  5  For example  during the 2000 election  voter turnout among those in the top 26  with household incomes exceeding  75 000 was 27  higher than the average  42   edit  Class and health Homeless American Income also had a significant impact on health as those with higher incomes had better access to health care facilities  higher life expectancy  lower infant mortality rate and increased health consciousness  While the United States lacks socialized medicine similar to that found in many other post industrialized developed nations across Europe and Asia  85  of the U S  population were insured in 2005  Yet  discrepancies seem to remain beyond the difference between insured and uninsured  In 2006  Harvard researchers divided the U S  into  eight Americas   43  Life expectancy ranges from 84 9 years for Asian Americans who had an average per capita income of  21 566  to 71 1 years for Urban African Americans with an average per capita income of a  14 800  43  Furthermore  the United States like other post industrial nations saw increased health consciousness among persons of higher social status  Persons of higher status are less likely to smoke  more likely to exercise regularly and be more conscious of their diet  44  Additionally  poor Americans are more likely to consume lower quality  processed foods  One can therefore conclude that low socio economic status contributes to a person s likelihood of being obese  45  46   edit  See also Social class in American history Social stratification  edit  References   a b Eichar
