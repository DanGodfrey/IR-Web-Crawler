    k p r  KOP  r  is a chemical element with the symbol Cu  from Latin  cuprum  and atomic number 29  It is a ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity  Pure copper is soft and malleable  an exposed surface has a reddish orange tarnish  It is used as a conductor of heat and electricity  a building material  and a constituent of various metal alloys  The metal and its alloys have been used for thousands of years  In the Roman era  copper was principally mined on Cyprus  hence the origin of the name of the metal as  yprium  metal of Cyprus   later shortened to  uprum  Its compounds are commonly encountered as copper II  salts  which often impart blue or green colors to minerals such as turquoise and have been widely used historically as pigments  Architectural structures built with copper corrode to give green verdigris  or patina   Decorative art prominently features copper  both by itself and as part of pigments  Copper II  ions are water soluble  where they function at low concentration as bacteriostatic substances  fungicides  and wood preservatives  In sufficient amounts  they are poisonous to higher organisms  at lower concentrations it is an essential trace nutrient to all higher plant and animal life  The main areas where copper is found in animals are tissues  liver  muscle and bone  Contents 1 Characteristics 1 1 Physical 2 Chemical 2

Further reading 13 External links Characteristics Physical A copper disc  99 95  pure  made by continuous casting and etching  Copper just above its melting point keeps its pink luster color when enough light outshines the orange incandescence color  Copper  silver and gold are in group 11 of the periodic table  and they share certain attributes  they have one s orbital electron on top of a filled d electron shell and are characterized by high ductility and electrical conductivity  The filled d shells in these elements do not contribute much to the interatomic interactions  which are dominated by the s electrons through metallic bonds  Contrary to metals with incomplete d shells  metallic bonds in copper are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak  This explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of copper  2  At the macroscopic scale  introduction of extended defects to the crystal lattice  such as grain boundaries  hinders flow of the material under applied stress thereby increasing its hardness  For this reason  copper is usually supplied in a fine grained polycrystalline form  which has greater strength than monocrystalline forms  3  The low hardness of copper partly explains its high electrical  59 6 106 S m  and thus also high thermal conductivity  which are the second highest among pure metals at room temperature  4  This is because the resistivity to electron transport in metals at room temperature mostly originates from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice  which are relatively weak for a soft metal  2  The maximum permissible current density of copper in open air is approximately 3 1 106 A m2 of cross sectional area  above which it begins to heat excessively  5  As with other metals  if copper is placed against another metal  galvanic corrosion will occur  6  Together with osmium  bluish   and gold  yellow   copper is one of only three elemental metals with a natural color other than gray or silver  7  Pure copper is orange red and acquires a reddish tarnish when exposed to air  The characteristic color of copper results from the electronic transitions between the filled 3d and half empty 4s atomic shells   the energy difference between these shells is such that it corresponds to orange light  The same mechanism accounts for the yellow color of gold  2  Chemical Unoxidized copper wire  left  and oxidized copper wire  right   Copper forms a rich variety of compounds with oxidation states  1 and  2  which are often called cuprous and cupric  respectively  8  It does not react with water  but it slowly reacts with atmospheric oxygen forming a layer of brown black copper oxide  In contrast to the oxidation of iron by wet air  this oxide layer stops the further  bulk corrosion  A green layer of verdigris  copper carbonate  can often be seen on old copper constructions  such as the Statue of Liberty  the largest copper statue in the world built using repouss  and chasing  9 Hydrogen sulfides and sulfides react with copper to form various copper sulfides on the surface  In the latter case  the copper corrodes  as is seen when copper is exposed to air containing sulfur compounds  10  Oxygen containing ammonia solutions give water soluble complexes with copper  as do oxygen and hydrochloric acid to form copper chlorides and acidified hydrogen peroxide to form copper II  salts  Copper II  chloride and copper comproportionate to form copper I  chloride  11  Isotopes Main article  Isotopes of copper There are 29 isotopes of copper  63Cu and 65Cu are stable  with 63Cu comprising approximately 69  of naturally occurring copper  they both have a spin of 3 2  12  The other isotopes are radioactive  with the most stable being 67Cu with a half life of 61 83 hours  12  Seven metastable isotopes have been characterized  with 68mCu the longest lived with a half life of 3 8 minutes  Isotopes with a mass number above 64 decay by     whereas those with a mass number below 64 decay by     64Cu  which has a half life of 12 7 hours  decays both ways  13  62Cu and 64Cu have significant applications  64Cu is a radiocontrast for X ray imaging  and complexed with a chelate can be used for treating cancer  62Cu is used in 62Cu PTSM that is a radioactive tracer for positron emission tomography  14  Occurrence Copper can be found as either native copper or as part of minerals  Native copper is a polycrystal  with the largest described single crystal measuring 4 4 3 2 3 2 cm  15  The largest mass of elemental copper weighed 420 tonnes and was found in 1857 on the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan  US  16  There are many examples of copper containing minerals  chalcopyrite and chalcocite are copper sulfides  azurite and malachite are copper carbonates and cuprite is a copper oxide  4  Copper is present in the Earth s crust at a concentration of about 50 parts per million  ppm   16  and is also synthesized in massive stars  17  Production Chuquicamata in Chile is one of the world s largest open pit copper mines  World production trend Copper output in 2005 Copper prices 2003 2011 in USD per tonne Most copper is mined or extracted as copper sulfides from large open pit mines in porphyry copper deposits that contain 0 4 to 1 0  copper  Examples include Chuquicamata in Chile  Bingham Canyon Mine in Utah  United States and El Chino Mine in New Mexico  United States  According to the British Geological Survey  in 2005  Chile was the top mine producer of copper with at least one third world share followed by the United States  Indonesia and Peru  4  The amount of copper in use is increasing and the quantity available is barely sufficient to allow all countries to reach developed world levels of usage  18  Reserves Copper has been in use at least 10 000 years  but more than 95  of all copper ever mined and smelted has been extracted since 1900  As with many natural resources  the total amount of copper on Earth is vast  around 1014 tons just in the top kilometer of Earth s crust  or about 5 million years worth at the current rate of extraction   However  only a tiny fraction of these reserves is economically viable  given present day prices and technologies  Various estimates of existing copper reserves available for mining vary from 25 years to 60 years  depending on core assumptions such as the growth rate  19  Recycling is a major source of copper in the modern world  20  Because of these and other factors  the future of copper production and supply is the subject of much debate  including the concept of Peak copper  analogue to Peak Oil  The price of copper has historically been unstable  21  and it quintupled from the 60 year low of US 0 60 lb  US 1 32 kg  in June 1999 to US 3 75 per pound  US 8 27 kg  in May 2006  It dropped to US 2 40 lb  US 5 29 kg  in February 2007  then rebounded to US 3 50 lb  US 7 71 kg  in April 2007  22  In February 2009  weakening global demand and a steep fall in commodity prices since the previous year s highs left copper prices at US 1 51 lb  23  Methods Main article  Copper extraction techniques The concentration of copper in ores averages only 0 6   and most commercial ores are sulfides  especially chalcopyrite  CuFeS2  and to a lesser extent chalcocite  Cu2S   24  These minerals are concentrated from crushed ores to the level of 10 15  copper by froth flotation or bioleaching  25  Heating this material with silica in flash smelting removes much of the iron as slag  The process exploits the greater ease of converting iron sulfides into its oxides  which in turn react with the silica to form the silicate slag  which floats on top of the heated mass  The resulting copper matte consisting of Cu2S is then roasted to convert all sulfides into oxides  24  2 Cu2S   3 O2   2 Cu2O   2 SO2 The cuprous oxide is converted to blister copper upon heating  2 Cu2O   4 Cu   O2 The Sudbury matte process converted only half the sulfide to oxide and then used this oxide to remove the rest of the sulfur as oxide  It was then electrolytically refined and the anode mud exploited for the platinum and gold it contained  This step exploits the relatively easy reduction of copper oxides to copper metal  Natural gas is blown across the blister to remove most of the remaining oxygen and electrorefining is performed on the resulting material to produce pure copper  26  Cu2    2 e    Cu Recycling Copper  like aluminium  is 100  recyclable without any loss of quality whether in a raw state or contained in a manufactured product  In volume  copper is the third most recycled metal after iron and aluminium  It is estimated that 80  of the copper ever mined is still in use today  27  According to the International Resource Panel s Metal Stocks in Society report  the global per capita stock of Copper in use in society is 35 55 kg  Much of this is in more developed countries  140 300 kg per capita  rather than less developed countries  30 40 kg per capita   The process of recycling copper follows roughly the same steps as is used to extract copper  but requires fewer steps  High purity scrap copper is melted in a furnace and then reduced and cast into billets and ingots  lower purity scrap is refined by electroplating in a bath of sulfuric acid  28  Compounds A sample of copper I  oxide  See also  Category Copper compounds Binary compounds As for other elements  the simplest compounds of copper are binary compounds  i e  those containing only two elements  The principal ones are the oxides  sulfides and halides  Both cuprous and cupric oxides are known  Among the numerous copper sulfides  important examples include copper I  sulfide and copper II  sulfide  The cuprous halides with chlorine  bromine  and iodine are known  as are the cupric halides with fluorine  chlorine  and bromine  Attempts to prepare copper II  iodide give cuprous iodide and iodine  8  2 Cu2    4 I    2 CuI   I2 Coordination chemistry Copper II  gives a deep blue coloration in the presence of ammonia ligands  The one used here is tetramminecopper II  sulfate  Copper  like all metals  forms coordination complexes with ligands  In aqueous solution  copper II  exists as  Cu H2O 6 2   This complex exhibits the fastest water exchange rate  speed of water ligands attaching and detaching  for any transition metal aquo complex  Adding aqueous sodium hydroxide causes the precipitation of light blue solid copper II  hydroxide  A simplified equation is  Cu2    2 OH    Cu OH 2 Aqueous ammonia results in the same precipitate  Upon adding excess ammonia  the precipitate dissolves  forming tetraamminecopper II   Cu H2O 4 OH 2   4 NH3    Cu H2O 2 NH3 4 2    2 H2O   2 OH  Many other oxyanions form complexes  these include copper II  acetate  copper II  nitrate  and copper II  carbonate  Copper II  sulfate forms a blue crystalline pentahydrate  which is the most familiar copper compound in the laboratory  It is used in a fungicide called the Bordeaux mixture  29  Ball and stick model of the complex  Cu NH3 4 H2O 2 2   illustrating the octahedral coordination geometry common for copper II   Polyols  compounds containing more than one alcohol functional group  generally interact with cupric salts  For example  copper salts are used to test for reducing sugars  Specifically  using Benedict s reagent and Fehling s solution the presence of the sugar is signaled by a color change from blue Cu II  to reddish copper I  oxide  30  Schweizer s reagent and related complexes with ethylenediamine and other amines dissolve cellulose  31 Amino acids form very stable chelate complexes with copper II   Many wet chemical tests for copper ions exist  one involving potassium ferrocyanide  which gives a brown precipitate with copper II  salts  Organocopper chemistry Main article  Organocopper compound Compounds that contain a carbon copper bond are known as organocopper compounds  They are very reactive towards oxygen to form copper I  oxide and have many uses in chemistry  They are synthesized by treating copper I  compounds with Grignard reagents  terminal alkynes or organolithium reagents  32  in particular  the last reaction described produces a Gilman reagent  These can undergo substitution with alkyl halides to form coupling products  as such  they are important in the field of organic synthesis  Copper I  acetylide is highly shock sensitive but is an intermediate in reactions such as the Cadiot Chodkiewicz coupling 33  and the Sonogashira coupling  34 Conjugate addition to enones 35  and carbocupration of alkynes 36  can also be achieved with organocopper compounds  Copper I  forms a variety of weak complexes with alkenes and carbon monoxide  especially in the presence of amine ligands  37  Copper III  and copper IV  Complexes of copper III  are frequent intermediates in reactions of organocopper compounds  Dicopper oxo complexes also feature copper III   38  Fluoride ligands  being highly basic  stabilize metal ions in high oxidation states  indeed  representative copper III  and copper IV  complex are fluorides  These include K3CuF6 and Cs2CuF6  8  With di  and tripeptides  purple colored complexes of copper III  have been observed  this high oxidation state being stabilized by the deprotonated amide ligands  39  History Copper Age Main article  Copper Age A corroded copper ingot from Zakros  Crete  shaped in the form of an animal skin typical for that era  Copper occurs naturally as native copper and was known to some of the oldest civilizations on record  It has a history of use that is at least 10 000 years old  and estimates of its discovery place it at 9000 BC in the Middle East  40  a copper pendant was found in northern Iraq that dates to 8700 BC  41  There is evidence that gold and meteoric iron  but not iron smelting  were the only metals used by humans before copper  42  The history of copper metallurgy is thought to have followed the following sequence  1  cold working of native copper  2  annealing  3  smelting  and 4  the lost wax method  In southeastern Anatolia  all four of these metallurgical techniques appears more or less simultaneously at the beginning of the Neolothic c  7500 BC  43  However  just as agriculture was independently invented in several parts of the world  including Pakistan  China  and the Americas  copper smelting was invented locally in several different places  It was probably discovered independently in China before 2800 BC  in Central America perhaps around 600 AD  and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD  44 Investment casting was invented in 4500 4000 BC in Southeast Asia 40  and carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire  UK at 2280 to 1890 BC  45  tzi the Iceman  a male dated from 3300 3200 BC  was found with an axe with a copper head 99 7  pure  high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest his involvement in copper smelting  46  Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals  in particular  copper smelting led to the discovery of iron smelting  46  Production in the Old Copper Complex in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC  47  48  Natural bronze  a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon  arsenic  and  rarely  tin  came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC  Previously the only tool made of copper had been the awl  used for punching holes in leather and gouging out peg holes for wood joining  However  the introduction of a more robust form of copper led to the widespread use  and large scale production of heavy metal tools  including axes  adzes  and axe adzes  citation needed  Bronze Age Main article  Bronze Age Alloying copper with tin to make bronze was first practiced about 4000 years after the discovery of copper smelting  and about 2000 years after  natural bronze  had come into general use  Bronze artifacts from Sumerian cities and Egyptian artifacts of copper and bronze alloys date to 3000 BC  49  The Bronze Age began in Southeastern Europe around 3700   3300 BC  in Northwestern Europe about 2500 BC  It ended with the beginning of the Iron Age  2000 1000 BC in the Near East  600 BC in Northern Europe  The transition between the Neolithic period and the Bronze Age was formerly termed the Chalcolithic period  copper stone   with copper tools being used with stone tools  This term has gradually fallen out of favor because in some parts of the world the Calcholithic and Neolithic are coterminous at both ends  Brass  an alloy of copper and zinc  is of much more recent origin  It was known to the Greeks  but became a significant supplement to bronze during the Roman Empire  49  Antiquity and Middle Ages In alchemy the symbol for copper  perhaps a stylized mirror  was also the symbol for the goddess and planet Venus  Chalcolithic copper mine in Timna Valley  Negev Desert  Israel  In Greece  copper was known by the name chalkos           It was an important resource for the Romans  Greeks and other ancient peoples  In Roman times  it was known as aes Cyprium  aes being the generic Latin term for copper alloys and Cyprium from Cyprus  where much copper was mined  The phrase was simplified to cuprum  hence the English copper  Aphrodite and Venus represented copper in mythology and alchemy  due to its lustrous beauty  its ancient use in producing mirrors  and its association with Cyprus  which was sacred to the goddess  The seven heavenly bodies known to the ancients were associated with the seven metals known in antiquity  and Venus was assigned to copper  50  Britain s first use of brass occurred around the 3rd 2nd century BC  In North America  copper mining began with marginal workings by Native Americans  Native copper is known to have been extracted from sites on Isle Royale with primitive stone tools between 800 and 1600  51  Copper metallurgy was flourishing in South America  particularly in Peru around 1000 AD  it proceeded at a much slower rate on other continents  Copper burial ornamentals from the 15th century have been uncovered  but the metal s commercial production did not start until the early 20th century  The cultural role of copper has been important  particularly in currency  Romans in the 6th through 3rd centuries BC used copper lumps as money  At first  the copper itself was valued  but gradually the shape and look of the copper became more important  Julius Caesar had his own coins made from brass  while Octavianus Augustus Caesar s coins were made from Cu Pb Sn alloys  With an estimated annual output of around 15 000 t  Roman copper mining and smelting activities reached a scale unsurpassed until the time of the Industrial Revolution  the provinces most intensely mined were those of Hispania  Cyprus and in Central Europe  52  53  The gates of the Temple of Jerusalem used Corinthian bronze made by depletion gilding  It was most prevalent in Alexandria  where alchemy is thought to have begun  54  In ancient India  copper was used in the holistic medical science Ayurveda for surgical instruments and other medical equipment  Ancient Egyptians   2400 BC  used copper for sterilizing wounds and drinking water  and later on for headaches  burns  and itching  The Baghdad Battery  with copper cylinders soldered to lead  dates back to 248 BC to AD 226 and resembles a galvanic cell  leading people to believe this was the first battery  the claim has not been verified  55  Modern period Acid mine drainage affecting the stream running from the disused Parys Mountain copper mines The Great Copper Mountain was a mine in Falun  Sweden  that operated from the 10th century to 1992  It produced two thirds of Europe s copper demand in the 17th century and helped fund many of Sweden s wars during that time  56  It was referred to as the nation s treasury  Sweden had a copper backed currency  57  The uses of copper in art were not limited to currency  it was used by Renaissance sculptors  in pre photographic technology known as the daguerreotype  and the Statue of Liberty  Copper plating and copper sheathing for ships  hulls was widespread  the ships of Christopher Columbus were among the earliest to have this feature  58  The Norddeutsche Affinerie in Hamburg was the first modern electroplating plant starting its production in 1876  59  The German scientist Gottfried Osann invented powder metallurgy in 1830 while determining the metal s atomic mass  around then it was discovered that the amount and type of alloying element  e g   tin  to copper would affect bell tones  Flash smelting was developed by Outokumpu in Finland and first applied at Harjavalta in 1949  the energy efficient process accounts for 50  of the world s primary copper production  60  The Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries  formed in 1967 with Chile  Peru  Zaire and Zambia  played a similar role for copper as OPEC does for oil  It never achieved the same influence  particularly because the second largest producer  the United States  was never a member  it was dissolved in 1988  61  Applications Assorted copper fittings The major applications of copper are in electrical wires  60    roofing and plumbing  20   and industrial machinery  15    Copper is mostly used as a metal  but when a higher hardness is required it is combined with other elements to make an alloy  5  of total use  such as brass and bronze  16  A small part of copper supply is used in production of compounds for nutritional supplements and fungicides in agriculture  29  62 Machining of copper is possible  although it is usually necessary to use an alloy for intricate parts to get good machinability characteristics  Electronics and related devices Copper electrical busbars distributing power to a large building The electrical properties of copper are exploited in copper wires and devices such as electromagnets  Integrated circuits and printed circuit boards increasingly feature copper in place of aluminium because of its superior electrical conductivity  see Copper interconnect for main article   heat sinks and heat exchangers use copper as a result of its superior heat dissipation capacity to aluminium  Vacuum tubes  cathode ray tubes  and the magnetrons in microwave ovens use copper  as do wave guides for microwave radiation  63  Electric motors Main article  Copper in energy efficient motors Copper s greater conductivity versus other metallic materials enhances the electrical energy efficiency of motors  64  This is important because motors and motor driven systems account for 43  46  of all global electricity consumption and 69  of all electricity used by industry  65  Increasing the mass and cross section of copper in a coil increases the electrical energy efficiency of the motor  Copper motor rotors  a new technology designed for motor applications where energy savings are prime design objectives  66  67  are enabling general purpose induction motors to meet and exceed National Electrical Manufacturers Association  NEMA  premium efficiency standards  68  Architecture and industry Copper roof on the Minneapolis City Hall  coated with patina Old copper utensils in a Jerusalem restaurant Because of the waterproof nature of copper  it has been used as the roofing material of many buildings since ancient times  The green color on these buildings is due to a long term chemical reaction  copper is first oxidized to copper II  oxide  then to cuprous and cupric sulfide and finally to copper II  carbonate  also called verdigris  which is highly corrosion resistant  69  The copper used in this application is phosphorus deoxidized copper  Cu DHP   70 Lightning rods use copper as a means to divert electric current throughout the ground instead of destroying the main structure  71  Copper has excellent brazing and soldering properties and can be welded  the best results are obtained with gas metal arc welding  72  Copper in alloys See also  List of copper alloys Numerous copper alloys exist  many with important uses  Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc and bronze usually refers to copper tin alloys  but can refer to any alloy of copper such as aluminium bronze  Copper is one of the most important constituents of carat silver and gold alloys and carat solders used in the jewelry industry  modifying the color  hardness and melting point of the resulting alloys  73  The alloy of copper and nickel  called cupronickel  is used in low denomination statuary coins  often for the outer cladding  The US 5 cent coin called nickel consists of 75  copper and 25  nickel and has a homogeneous composition  The 90  copper 10  nickel alloy is remarkable by its resistance to corrosion and is used in various parts being exposed to seawater  Alloys of copper with aluminium  about 7   have a pleasant golden color and are used in decorations  16  Copper alloys with tin are part of lead free solders  74  Antibiofouling applications Main article  Copper alloys in aquaculture Copper has long been used as a biostatic surface to line parts of ships to protect against barnacles and mussels  It was originally used pure  but has since been superseded by Muntz metal  Bacteria will not grow on a copper surface because it is biostatic  Similarly  as discussed in copper alloys in aquaculture  copper alloys have become important netting materials in the aquaculture industry for the fact that they are antimicrobial and prevent biofouling even in extreme conditions 75  and have strong structural and corrosion resistant 76  properties in marine environments  Other uses Copper compounds in liquid form are used as a wood preservative  particularly in treating original portion of structures during restoration of damage due to dry rot  Together with zinc  copper wires may be placed over non conductive roofing materials to discourage the growth of moss  Textile fibers use copper to create antimicrobial protective fabrics  77  as do ceramic glazes  stained glass and musical instruments  Electroplating commonly uses copper as a base for other metals such as nickel  Copper is one of three metals  along with lead and silver  used in a museum materials testing procedure called the Oddy test  In this procedure  copper is used to detect chlorides  oxides  and sulfur compounds  Copper is also commonly found in jewelry  and folklore states that copper bracelets relieve arthritis symptoms  though this is not proven  78  Biological role Main article  Copper in health Rich sources of copper include oysters  beef and lamb liver  Brazil nuts  blackstrap molasses  cocoa  and black pepper  Good sources include lobster  nuts and sunflower seeds  green olives  avocados  and wheat bran  Copper proteins have diverse roles in biological electron transport and oxygen transportation  processes that exploit the easy interconversion of Cu I  and Cu II   79  The biological role for copper commenced with the appearance of oxygen in earth s atmosphere  80  The protein hemocyanin is the oxygen carrier in most mollusks and some arthropods such as the horseshoe crab  Limulus polyphemus   81  Because hemocyanin is blue  these organisms have blue blood  not the red blood found in organisms that rely on hemoglobin for this purpose  Structurally related to hemocyanin are the laccases and tyrosinases  Instead of reversibly binding oxygen  these proteins hydroxylate substrates  illustrated by their role in the formation of lacquers  79  Copper is also a component of other proteins associated with the processing of oxygen  In cytochrome c oxidase  which is required for aerobic respiration  copper and iron cooperate in the reduction of oxygen  Copper is also found in many superoxide dismutases  proteins that detoxify superoxides  by converting it  by disproportionation  to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide  2 HO2   H2O2   O2 Several copper proteins  such as the  blue copper proteins   do not interact directly with substrates  hence they are not enzymes  These proteins relay electrons by the process called electron transfer  79  Photosynthesis functions by an elaborate electron transport chain within the thylakoid membrane  A central  link  in this chain is plastocyanin  a blue copper protein  Dietary needs Copper is an essential trace element in plants and animals  but not some microorganisms  The human body contains copper at a level of about 1 4 to 2 1 mg per kg of body mass  82  Stated differently  the RDA for copper in normal healthy adults is quoted as 0 97 mg day and as 3 0 mg day  83  Copper is absorbed in the gut  then transported to the liver bound to albumin  It enters the bloodstream via the plasma protein called ceruloplasmin  where its metabolism is controlled  and is excreted in bile  84  Copper based disorders Because of its role in facilitating iron uptake  copper deficiency can produce anemia like symptoms  neutropenia  bone abnormalities  hypopigmentation  impaired growth  increased incidence of infections  osteoporosis  and abnormalities in glucose and cholesterol metabolism  Conversely  an accumulation of copper in body tissues causes Wilson s disease  Severe deficiency can be found by testing for low plasma or serum copper levels  low ceruloplasmin  and low red blood cell superoxide dismutase levels  these are not sensitive to marginal copper status  The  cytochrome c oxidase activity of leucocytes and platelets  has been stated as another factor in deficiency  but the results have not been confirmed by replication  85  Antimicrobial applications Main articles  Antimicrobial properties of copper and Antimicrobial copper alloy touch surfaces Numerous antimicrobial efficacy studies have been conducted in the past 10 years regarding copper s efficacy to destroy a wide range of bacteria  as well as influenza A virus  adenovirus  and fungi  86  Copper alloy touch surfaces have natural intrinsic properties to destroy a wide range of microorganisms  e g   E  coli O157 H7  methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus  MRSA   Staphylococcus  Clostridium difficile  influenza A virus  adenovirus  and fungi   86  Some 355 copper alloys were proven to kill more than 99 9  of disease causing bacteria within just two hours when cleaned regularly  87  The United States Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  has approved the registrations of these copper alloys as  antimicrobial materials with public health benefits   87  which allows manufacturers to legally make claims as to the positive public health benefits of products made with registered antimicrobial copper alloys  In addition  the EPA has approved a long list of antimicrobial copper products made from these alloys  such as bedrails  handrails  over bed tables  sinks  faucets  door knobs  toilet hardware  computer keyboards  health club equipment  shopping cart handles  etc   for a comprehensive list of products  see  Antimicrobial copper alloy touch surfaces Approved products   Copper doorknobs are used by hospitals to reduce the transfer of disease  and Legionnaires  disease is suppressed by copper tubing in plumbing systems  88  Antimicrobial copper alloy products are now being installed in healthcare facilities in the U K   Ireland  Japan  Korea  France  Denmark  and Brazil and in the subway transit system in Santiago  Chile  where copper zinc alloy handrails will be installed in some 30 stations between 2011 2014  89  90  91  Precautions NFPA 704 0 2 0 Fire diamond for copper metal Main article  Copper toxicity Gram quantities of various copper salts have been taken in suicide attempts and produced acute copper toxicity in humans  possibly due to redox cycling and the generation of reactive oxygen species that damage DNA  92  Corresponding amounts of copper salts  30 mg kg  are toxic in animals  93  A minimum dietary value for healthy growth in rabbits has been reported to be at least 3 ppm in the diet  94  However  higher concentrations of copper  100 ppm  200 ppm  or 500 ppm  in the diet of rabbits may favorably influence feed conversion efficiency  growth rates  and carcass dressing percentages  95  Chronic copper toxicity does not normally occur in humans because of transport systems that regulate absorption and excretion  Autosomal recessive mutations in copper transport proteins can disable these systems  leading to Wilson s disease with copper accumulation and cirrhosis of the liver in persons who have inherited two defective genes  82  See also Electroplating Erosion corrosion of copper water tubes
