a war waged by a UN authorized coalition force from 34 nations led by the United States  against Iraq in response to Iraq s invasion and annexation of Kuwait  The war is also known under other names  such as the First Gulf War  Gulf War I  or the Iraq War  12  13  14  before the term  Iraq War  became identified instead with the 2003 Iraq War  also referred to in the U S  as  Operation Iraqi Freedom    The invasion of Kuwait by Iraqi troops that began 2 August 1990 was met with international condemnation  and brought immediate economic sanctions against Iraq by members of the UN Security Council  U S  President George H  W  Bush deployed American forces into Saudi Arabia  and urged other countries to send their own forces to the scene  An array of nations joined the coalition  The great majority of the military forces in the coalition were from the United States  with Saudi Arabia  the United Kingdom and Egypt as leading contributors  in that order  Around US 36 billion of the US 60 billion cost was paid by Saudi Arabia  15  The war was marked by the beginning of live news on the front lines of the fight  with the primacy of the U S  network CNN  16  17  18  The war has also earned the nickname Video Game War after the daily broadcast images on board the American bombers during Operation Desert Storm  19  20  The initial conflict to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait began with an aerial bombardment on 17 January 1991  This was followed by a ground assault on 23 February  This was a decisive victory for the coalition forces  who liberated Kuwait and advanced into Iraqi territory  The coalition ceased their advance  and declared a cease fire 100 hours after the ground campaign started  Aerial and ground combat was confined to Iraq  Kuwait  and areas on the border of Saudi Arabia  However  Iraq launched Scud missiles against coalition military targets in Saudi Arabia and against Israel  Contents 1 Background 1 1 Kuwait 1 1 1 Tensions 1 1 2 Invasion 1 2

and there was a history of friction between it and the United States  The U S  was concerned with Iraq s position on Israeli Palestinian politics  and its disapproval of the nature of the peace between Israel and Egypt  The United States also disliked Iraqi support for many Arab and Palestinian militant groups such as Abu Nidal  which led to its inclusion on the developing U S  list of State Sponsors of Terrorism on 29 December 1979  The U S  remained officially neutral after the invasion of Iran in 1980  which became the Iran Iraq War  although it assisted Iraq covertly  In March 1982  however  Iran began a successful counteroffensive   Operation Undeniable Victory  and the United States increased its support for Iraq to prevent Iran from forcing a surrender  In a U S  bid to open full diplomatic relations with Iraq  the country was removed from the U S  list of State Sponsors of Terrorism  Ostensibly this was because of improvement in the regime s record  although former United States Assistant Secretary of Defense Noel Koch later stated   No one had any doubts about  the Iraqis   continued involvement in terrorism    The real reason was to help them succeed in the war against Iran   21  With Iraq s newfound success in the war  and the Iranian rebuff of a peace offer in July  arms sales to Iraq reached a record spike in 1982  An obstacle  however  remained to any potential U S  Iraqi relationship   Abu Nidal continued to operate with official support in Baghdad  When Iraqi President Saddam Hussein expelled the group to Syria at the United States  request in November 1983  the Reagan administration sent Donald Rumsfeld to meet President Hussein as a special envoy and to cultivate ties   edit  Kuwait  edit  Tensions By the time the ceasefire with Iran was signed in August 1988  Iraq was virtually bankrupt  with most of its debt owed to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait  Iraq pressured both nations to forgive the debts  but they refused  Iraq also accused Kuwait of exceeding its OPEC quotas and driving down the price of oil  thus further hurting the Iraqi economy  The collapse in oil prices had a catastrophic impact on the Iraqi economy  The Iraqi Government described it as a form of economic warfare  which it claimed was aggravated by Kuwait slant drilling across the border into Iraq s Rumaila oil field  22  Map of Kuwait The Iraq Kuwait dispute also involved Iraqi claims to Kuwait as a territory of Iraq  After gaining independence from the United Kingdom in 1932  the Iraqi government immediately declared that Kuwait was rightfully a territory of Iraq  as it had been associated with Basra until the British creation of Kuwait after World War I and thus stated that Kuwait was a British imperialist invention  23  Iraq claimed Kuwait had been a part of the Ottoman Empire s province of Basra  Its ruling dynasty  the al Sabah family  had concluded a protectorate agreement in 1899 that assigned responsibility for its foreign affairs to Britain  Britain drew the border between the two countries  and deliberately tried to limit Iraq s access to the ocean so that any future Iraqi government would be in no position to threaten Britain s domination of the Persian Gulf  Iraq refused to accept the border  and did not recognize the Kuwaiti government until 1963  24  In early July 1990  Iraq complained about Kuwait s behavior  such as not respecting their quota  and openly threatened to take military action  On the 23rd  the CIA reported that Iraq had moved 30 000 troops to the Iraq Kuwait border  and the U S  naval fleet in the Persian Gulf was placed on alert  On the 25th  Saddam Hussein met with April Glaspie  an American ambassador  in Baghdad  According to an Iraqi transcript of that meeting  Glaspie told the Iraqi delegation   We have no opinion on the Arab Arab conflicts   25  According to Glaspie s own account  she stated in reference to the precise border between Kuwait and Iraq         that she had served in Kuwait 20 years before   then  as now  we took no position on these Arab affairs    26  On 31 July  negotiations in Jeddah between Iraq and Kuwait failed violently   edit  Invasion Main article  Invasion of Kuwait M 84 main battle tanks of the Kuwaiti Armed Forces Kuwait Air Force A 4KU Skyhawks On 2 August 1990 Iraq launched the invasion by bombing Kuwait City  the Kuwaiti capital  In spite of Iraqi saber rattling  Kuwait did not have its forces on alert  and was caught unaware  Iraqi commandos infiltrated the Kuwaiti border first to prepare for the major units which began the attack at the stroke of midnight  The Iraqi attack had two prongs  with the primary attack force driving south straight for Kuwait City down the main highway  and a supporting attack entering Kuwait farther west  but then turning and driving due east  cutting off the capital city from the southern half of the country  The commander of a Kuwaiti armored battalion  35th Armoured Brigade  deployed them against the Iraqi attack and was able to conduct a robust defense  The Battle of the Bridges   near Al Jahra  west of Kuwait City  27  Kuwait Air Force aircraft scrambled to meet the invading force  but approximately 20  were lost or captured  An air battle with the Iraqi helicopter airborne forces was fought over Kuwait City  inflicting heavy losses on the Iraqi elite troops  and a few combat sorties were flown against Iraqi ground forces  28  The main Iraqi thrust into Kuwait City was conducted by commandos deployed by helicopters and boats to attack the city from the sea  while other divisions seized the airports and two airbases  The Iraqis attacked the Dasman Palace  the Royal Residence of the Emir of Kuwait  Jaber Al Ahmad Al Jaber Al Sabah  which was defended by the Emiri Guard supported with M 84 tanks  In the process  the Iraqis killed Fahad Al Ahmed Al Jaber Al Sabah  the Emir of Kuwait s youngest brother  29  After two days of intense combat  most of the Kuwaiti Armed Forces were either overrun by the Iraqi Republican Guard  or had escaped to neighboring Saudi Arabia  The emir and key ministers were able to get out and head south along the highway for refuge in Saudi Arabia  Iraqi ground forces consolidated their control on Kuwait City  then headed south and redeployed along the border of Saudi Arabia  After the decisive Iraqi victory  Saddam Hussein initially installed a puppet regime known as the  Provisional Government of Free Kuwait  before installing his cousin Ali Hassan al Majid as the governor of Kuwait on 8 August  29   edit  Diplomacy  edit  UN resolution Within hours of the invasion  Kuwaiti and U S  delegations requested a meeting of the UN Security Council  which passed Resolution 660  condemning the invasion and demanding a withdrawal of Iraqi troops  On 3 August the Arab League passed its own resolution  which called for a solution to the conflict from within the League  and warned against outside intervention  Iraq and Libya were the only two nations in the Arab League which opposed a resolution for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait  The PLO opposed it as well  30  31  The Arab nations of Yemen and Jordan   a Western ally which bordered Iraq and relied on the country for economic support 32    also opposed military intervention from non Arab nations  33  The Arab nation of Sudan also aligned itself with Hussein  32  On 6 August UN Resolution 661 placed economic sanctions on Iraq  United Nations Security Council Resolution 665 followed soon after  which authorized a naval blockade to enforce the economic sanctions against Iraq  It said the  use of measures commensurate to the specific circumstances as may be necessary     to halt all inward and outward maritime shipping in order to inspect and verify their cargoes and destinations and to ensure strict implementation of resolution 661   34   edit  Iraqi American diplomacy President Bush visiting American troops in Saudi Arabia on Thanksgiving Day  1990  From the beginning  U S  officials insisted on a total Iraqi pullout from Kuwait  without any linkage to other Middle Eastern problems  fearing any concessions would strengthen Iraqi influence in the region for years to come  35  On 12 August 1990  Saddam Hussein called for compromise via Baghdad radio and the former Iraqi News Agency  Hussein  propose d  that all cases of occupation  and those cases that have been portrayed as occupation  in the region  be resolved simultaneouly  sic    Specifically  he called for Israel to withdraw from occupied territories in Palestine  Syria  and Lebanon  Syria to withdraw from Lebanon  and  mutual withdrawals by Iraq and Iran and arrangement for the situation in Kuwait   He also called for a replacement of US troops that mobilized in Saudi Arabia in response to the invasion of Kuwait with  an Arab force   as long as that force did not involve Egypt  Additionally  he requested an  immediate freeze of all boycott and siege decisions  and a general normalization of relations with Iraq  36  From the beginning of the crisis  President Bush was strongly opposed to any  linkage  between the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait and the Palestinian issue  37  Saddam Hussein detained several Westerners  with video footage shown on state television On 23 August Saddam Hussein appeared on state television with Western hostages to whom he had refused exit visas  In the video he asks a young British boy named Stuart Lockwood whether he is getting his milk  and goes on to say  through his interpreter   We hope your presence as guests here will not be for too long  Your presence here  and in other places  is meant to prevent the scourge of war   38  Another Iraqi proposal communicated in August 1990 was delivered to National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft by an unidentified Iraqi official  The official communicated to the White House that Iraq would  withdraw from Kuwait and allow foreigners to leave  provided that the UN lifted sanctions  allowed   guaranteed access  to the Persian Gulf through the Kuwaiti islands of Bubiyan and Warbah   and allowed Iraq to  gain full control of the Rumailah oil field that extends slightly into Kuwaiti territory   The proposal also  include d  offers to negotiate an oil agreement with the United States  satisfactory to both nations  national security interests   develop a joint plan  to alleviate Iraq s economical and financial problems  and  jointly work on the stability of the gulf    39  In December 1990  Iraq made a proposal to withdraw from Kuwait provided that their forces were not attacked as they left  and that a consensus was reached regarding the banning of WMD in the Palestinian region  The White House rejected the proposal  40 Yasser Arafat of the PLO expressed that neither he nor Hussein insisted that solving the Israel Palestine issues should be a precondition to solving the issues in Kuwait  though he did acknowledge a  strong link  between these problems  41  Ultimately  the US stuck to its hard line position that there would be no negotiations until Iraq withdrew from Kuwait and that they should not grant Iraq concessions  lest they give the impression that Iraq benefited from its military campaign  35  Also  when Secretary of State James Baker met with Tariq Aziz in Geneva for last minute peace talks in early 1991  Aziz reportedly made no concrete proposals and did not outline any hypothetical Iraqi moves  42   edit  UN Diplomacy On 29 November 1990 the U N  passed security council resolution 678 which gave Iraq until 15 January 1991 to withdraw from Kuwait and empowered states to use  all necessary means  to force Iraq out of Kuwait after the deadline  On 14 January 1991  France proposed that the U N  Security Council call for  a rapid and massive withdrawal  from Kuwait along with a statement to Iraq that Council members would bring their  active contribution  to a settlement of other problems of the region   in particular  of the Arab Israeli conflict and in particular to the Palestinian problem by convening  at an appropriate moment  an international conference  to assure  the security  stability and development of this region of the world   The French proposal was supported by Belgium  at the moment one of the rotating Security Council members   and Germany  Spain  Italy  Algeria  Morocco  Tunisia  and several non aligned nations  The U S   Great Britain  and the Soviet Union  rejected it  American U N  Ambassador Thomas Pickering stated that the French proposal was unacceptable  because it went beyond previous U N  Security Council resolutions on the Iraqi invasion  43  44  45   edit  Operation Desert Shield  Operation Desert Shield  redirects here  For the 2006 operation by the Iraqi insurgency  see Operation Desert Shield  Iraq   One of the main concerns to the West was the significant threat Iraq posed to Saudi Arabia  Following the conquest of Kuwait  the Iraqi army was within easy striking distance of Saudi oil fields  Control of these fields  along with Kuwaiti and Iraqi reserves  would have given Hussein control over the majority of the world s oil reserves  Iraq also had a number of grievances with Saudi Arabia  The Saudis had lent Iraq some 26 billion dollars during its war with Iran  The Saudis backed Iraq  as they feared the influence of Shia Iran s Islamic revolution on its own Shia minority  After the war  Saddam felt he should not have to repay the loans due to the help he had given the Saudis by fighting Iran  F 15Es parked during Operation Desert Shield  Soon after his conquest of Kuwait  Hussein began verbally attacking the Saudi kingdom  He argued that the U S  supported Saudi state was an illegitimate and unworthy guardian of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina  He combined the language of the Islamist groups that had recently fought in Afghanistan with the rhetoric Iran had long used to attack the Saudis  46  Acting on the policy of the Carter Doctrine  and out of fear the Iraqi army could launch an invasion of Saudi Arabia  U S  President George H  W  Bush quickly announced that the U S  would launch a  wholly defensive  mission to prevent Iraq from invading Saudi Arabia under the codename Operation Desert Shield  Operation Desert Shield began on 7 August 1990 when U S  troops were sent to Saudi Arabia due also to the request of its monarch  King Fahd  who had earlier called for U S  military assistance  47  This  wholly defensive  doctrine was quickly abandoned when  on 8 August  Iraq declared Kuwait to be the 19th province of Iraq and Saddam Hussein named his cousin  Ali Hassan Al Majid as its military governor  48  The United States Navy dispatched two naval battle groups built around the aircraft carriers USS Dwight D  Eisenhower and USS Independence to the Gulf  where they were ready by 8 August  The U S  also sent the battleships USS Missouri and USS Wisconsin to the region  A total of 48 U S  Air Force F 15s from the 1st Fighter Wing at Langley Air Force Base  Virginia  landed in Saudi Arabia  and immediately commenced round the clock air patrols of the Saudi Kuwait Iraq border areas to discourage further Iraqi military advances  They were joined by 36 F 15 A Ds from the 36th TFW at Bitburg  Germany  The Bitburg contingent was based at Al Kharj Air Base  approximately 1 hour southeast of Riyadh  The 36th TFW would be responsible for 11 confirmed Iraqi Air Force aircraft shot down during the war  There were also two Air National Guard units stationed at Al Kharj Air Base  the South Carolina Air National Guard  169th Fighter Wing  flew bombing missions with 24 F 16 s flying 2 000 combat missions and dropping 4 million pounds of munitions  and the New York Air National Guard 174th Fighter Wing from Syracuse flew 24 F 16 s on bombing missions  Military buildup continued from there  eventually reaching 543 000 troops  twice the number used in the 2003 invasion of Iraq  Much of the material was airlifted or carried to the staging areas via fast sealift ships  allowing a quick buildup   edit  Creating a coalition A series of UN Security Council resolutions and Arab League resolutions were passed regarding the invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein s Iraq  One of the most important was Resolution 678  passed on 29 November 1990  which gave Iraq a withdrawal deadline until 15 January 1991  and authorized  all necessary means to uphold and implement Resolution 660   and a diplomatic formulation authorizing the use of force if Iraq failed to comply  49  H  Norman Schwarzkopf  Jr  and President George H  W  Bush visit U S  troops in Saudi Arabia on Thanksgiving Day  1990  The United States assembled a coalition of forces to join it in opposing Iraq s aggression  consisting of forces from 34 countries  Argentina  Australia  Bahrain  Bangladesh  Belgium  Canada  Denmark  Egypt  France  Greece  Italy  Kuwait  Morocco  Netherlands  New Zealand  Niger  Norway  Oman  Pakistan  Portugal  Qatar  South Korea  Saudi Arabia  Senegal  Sierra Leone  Singapore  Spain  Syria  the United Arab Emirates  the United Kingdom and the United States itself  50  US Army General Norman Schwarzkopf was designated to be the commander of the coalition forces in the Persian Gulf area  Although they did not contribute any forces  Japan and Germany made financial contributions totaling  10 billion and  6 6 billion respectively  U S  troops represented 73  of the coalition s 956 600 troops in Iraq  Many of the coalition forces were reluctant to join  Some felt that the war was an internal Arab affair  or did not want to increase U S  influence in the Middle East  In the end  however  many nations were persuaded by Iraq s belligerence towards other Arab states  offers of economic aid or debt forgiveness  and threats to withhold aid  51   edit  Justification for intervention Cheney meets with Prince Sultan  Minister of Defence and Aviation in Saudi Arabia to discuss how to handle the invasion of Kuwait The United States and the United Nations gave several public justifications for involvement in the conflict  the most prominent being the Iraqi violation of Kuwaiti territorial integrity  In addition  the United States moved to support its ally Saudi Arabia  whose importance in the region  and as a key supplier of oil  made it of considerable geopolitical importance  Shortly after the Iraqi invasion  Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney made the first of several visits to Saudi Arabia where King Fahd requested US military assistance  During a speech in a special joint session of the U S  Congress given on 11 September 1990  U S  President George H  W  Bush summed up the reasons with the following remarks   Within three days  120 000 Iraqi troops with 850 tanks had poured into Kuwait and moved south to threaten Saudi Arabia  It was then that I decided to act to check that aggression   52  The Pentagon claimed that satellite photos showing a buildup of Iraqi forces along the border were the source of this information  but this was later shown to be false  A reporter for the Saint Petersburg Times acquired two commercial Soviet satellite images made at the time in question  which showed nothing but empty desert  53  However  serious questions were raised later when it was revealed that the satellite images were actually Soviet military images  not private commercial images  and it would have been impossible for the Soviets to share original source imagery without compromising security of classified images  The images were  in fact  not different magnifications of one original source image of the area in question  but separate images taken at different times and locations  The Soviets were heavily invested in Iraq and made numerous attempts to stop the coalition from invading Iraq  through diplomacy and also through deceptive propaganda  and in this case it was the Christian Science Monitor  not the Saint Petersburg Times who broke the story  as erroneously reported in this article and other publications  citation needed  Gen  Colin Powell  left   Gen  Norman Schwarzkopf  Jr   and Paul Wolfowitz  right  listen as Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney addresses reporters regarding the 1991 Gulf War  Other justifications for foreign involvement included Iraq s history of human rights abuses under President Saddam  Iraq was also known to possess biological weapons and chemical weapons  which Saddam had used against Iranian troops during the Iran Iraq War and against his own country s Kurdish population in the Al Anfal Campaign  Iraq was also known to have a nuclear weapons program   source   Although there were human rights abuses committed in Kuwait by the invading Iraqi military  the ones best known in the U S  were inventions of the public relations firm hired by the government of Kuwait to influence U S  opinion in favor of military intervention  Shortly after Iraq s invasion of Kuwait  the organization Citizens for a Free Kuwait was formed in the U S  It hired the public relations firm Hill  amp  Knowlton for about  11 million  paid by the Kuwaiti government  54  Among many other means of influencing U S  opinion  distributing books on Iraqi atrocities to U S  soldiers deployed in the region   Free Kuwait  T shirts and speakers to college campuses  and dozens of video news releases to television stations   the firm arranged for an appearance before a group of members of the U S  Congress in which a woman identifying herself as a nurse working in the Kuwait City hospital described Iraqi soldiers pulling babies out of incubators and letting them die on the floor  55  The story was an influence in tipping both the public and Congress towards a war with Iraq  six Congressmen said the testimony was enough for them to support military action against Iraq and seven Senators referenced the testimony in debate  The Senate supported the military actions in a 52 47 vote  A year after the war  however  this allegation was revealed to be a fabrication  The woman who had testified was found to be a member of the Kuwaiti Royal Family  in fact the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the U S  55  She had not been living in Kuwait during the Iraqi invasion  The details of the Hill  amp  Knowlton public relations campaign  including the incubator testimony  were published in a John R  MacArthur s Second Front  Censorship and Propaganda in the Gulf War  Berkeley  CA  University of CA Press  1992   and came to wide public attention when an Op ed by MacArthur was published in the New York Times  This prompted a reexamination by Amnesty International  which had originally promoted an account alleging even greater numbers of babies torn from incubators than the original fake testimony  After finding no evidence to support it  the organization issued a retraction  President George H  W  Bush then repeated the incubator allegations on television  At the same time  the Iraqi army committed several well documented crimes during its occupation of Kuwait  such as the summary execution without trial of three brothers after which their bodies were stacked in a pile and left to decay in a public street  56  Iraqi troops also ransacked and looted private Kuwaiti homes  one residence was repeatedly defecated in  57  A resident later commented   The whole thing was violence for the sake of violence  destruction for the sake of destruction    Imagine a surrealistic painting by Salvador Dal    58   edit  Early battles  edit  Air campaign Main article  Gulf War air campaign An F 14A Tomcat from VF 32  two EA 6B Prowlers  and a KC 135 Stratotanker during Desert Storm  The Persian Gulf War started with an extensive aerial bombing campaign on 17 January 1991  The coalition flew over 100 000 sorties  dropping 88 500 tons of bombs  59  and widely destroying military and civilian infrastructure  60  The air campaign was commanded by USAF Lieutenant General Chuck Horner  who briefly served as Commander in Chief   Forward of U S  Central Command while General Schwarzkopf was still in the United States  A day after the deadline set in Resolution 678  the coalition launched a massive air campaign  which began the general offensive codenamed Operation Desert Storm  The first priority for Coalition forces was the destruction of the Iraqi air force and anti aircraft facilities  The sorties were launched mostly from Saudi Arabia and the six Coalition aircraft carrier battle groups  CVBG  in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea  An Iraqi T 54A or Type 59 tank lies in ruins in the aftermath of an Allied bombing attack during Operation Desert Storm  The next coalition targets were command and communication facilities  Saddam Hussein had closely micromanaged the Iraqi forces in the Iran Iraq War  and initiative at lower levels was discouraged  Coalition planners hoped that Iraqi resistance would quickly collapse if deprived of command and control  The third and largest phase of the air campaign targeted military targets throughout Iraq and Kuwait  Scud missile launchers  weapons research facilities  and naval forces  About one third of the Coalition airpower was devoted to attacking Scuds  some of which were on trucks and therefore difficult to locate  Some U S  and British special forces teams had been covertly inserted into western Iraq to aid in the search and destruction of Scuds  Iraqi antiaircraft defenses  including MANPADS  were surprisingly ineffective against coalition aircraft and the coalition suffered only 75 aircraft losses in over 100 000 sorties  44 of which were the result of Iraqi action  Two of these losses are the result of aircraft colliding with the ground while evading Iraqi ground fired weapons  61  62  One of these losses is a confirmed air air victory  63   edit  Iraq launches missile strikes This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help

The Iraqi government made no secret that it would attack Israel if invaded  Prior to the start of the war  Tariq Aziz  Iraq s English speaking Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister  was asked in the aftermath of the failed U S  Iraq peace talks in Geneva  Switzerland by a reporter   Mr  Foreign Minister  if war starts   will you attack Israel   His response was   Yes  absolutely  yes   64  65  Five hours after the first attacks  Iraq s state radio broadcast a voice identified as Saddam Hussein declaring that  The great duel  the mother of all battles has begun  The dawn of victory nears as this great showdown begins   Iraq responded by launching eight Al Hussein missiles at Israel the next day  These missile attacks on Israel were to continue throughout the war  A total of 42 Scud missiles were fired by Iraq into Israel during the seven weeks of the war  66  The Iraqis hoped that they would provoke a military response from Israel  It was expected that many Arab nations would withdraw from the coalition  as they would be reluctant to fight alongside Israel  37  Following the first attacks  Israeli Air Force jets were deployed to patrol the northern airspace with Iraq  and Israel prepared to respond with military force  as its policy for the previous forty years had always been retaliation  However  President Bush pressured Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir not to retaliate and withdraw Israeli jets  fearing that if Israel attacked Iraq  the other Arab nations would either desert from the coalition or join Iraq  It was also feared that if Israel used Syrian or Jordanian airspace to attack Iraq  they would intervene in the war on Iraq s side or attack Israel  Israel was promised that the Coalition would deploy Patriot missiles to defend Israel if it refrained from responding to the Scud attacks  67  68  Israeli civilians taking shelter from rockets The Scud missiles targeting Israel were relatively ineffective  as firing at extreme range resulted in a dramatic reduction in accuracy and payload  The missile attacks killed two Israeli civilians  and caused several others to suffer fatal heart attacks  Approximately 230 Israelis were injured  Of the injuries  10 were considered moderate injuries  while one was considered a severe injury  10  Extensive property damage was also caused  and some 4 000 Israelis were left homeless  It was feared that Iraq would fire missiles filled with nerve agents or sarin  As a result  the Israeli government issued gas masks to its citizens  When the first Iraqi missiles hit Israel  some people injected themselves with an antidote for nerve gas  Aftermath of an Al Hussein strike on US barracks  In response to the threat of Scuds on Israel  the United States rapidly sent a Patriot missile air defense artillery battalion to Israel along with two batteries of MIM 104 Patriot missiles for the protection of civilians  69  Coalition air forces were also extensively exercised in  Scud hunts  in the Iraqi desert  trying to locate the camouflaged trucks before they fired their missiles at Israel or Saudi Arabia  On the ground  special forces also infiltrated Iraq  tasked with locating and destroying Scuds  Once special operations were combined with air patrols  the number of attacks fell sharply  then increased slightly as Iraqi forces adjusted to Coalition tactics  At one point  Israeli commandos were loaded onto helicopters ready to fly to Iraq  but the mission was called off after a phone call from US Defense Secretary Dick Cheney  reporting on the extent of Coalition efforts to destroy Scuds and emphasizing that Israeli intervention could endanger American forces  70  The Royal Netherlands Air Force also deployed Patriot missiles in both Turkey and Israel to counter the Scud threat  The Dutch Defense Ministry later stated that the military use of the Patriot missile system was largely ineffective  but its psychological value was high  even though the Patriot missiles caused far more casualties and property damage than the Scuds themselves did  71  72  It has been suggested that the sturdy construction techniques used in Israeli cities  coupled with the fact that Scuds were only launched at night  played an important role in limiting the number of casualties from Scud attacks  10  Three Scud missiles and a coalition Patriot that malfunctioned hit Ramat Gan on 22 January 1991  injuring 96 people  and possibly causing the deaths of three elderly people who died of strokes  In addition  47 Scud missiles were fired into Saudi Arabia  and one missile was fired at Bahrain and another at Qatar  The missiles were fired at both military and civilian targets  One Saudi civilian was killed  and 78 others were injured  No casualties were reported in Bahrain or Qatar  The Saudi government issued all its citizens and expatriates with gas masks in the event of Iraq using missiles with atomic war heads  The government broadcast alerts and  all clear  messages over television to warn citizens during scud attacks  On 25 February 1991  a Scud missile hit a U S  Army barracks of the 14th quartermaster Detachment  out of Greensburg  PA  stationed in Dhahran  Saudi Arabia  killing 28 soldiers and injuring over 100  11   edit  Battle of Khafji This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Main article  Battle of Khafji Military operations during liberation of Khafji On 29 January Iraqi forces attacked and occupied the lightly defended Saudi city of Khafji with tanks and infantry  The Battle of Khafji ended two days later when the Iraqis were driven back by the Saudi Arabian National Guard and the United States Marine Corps  supported by Qatari forces  The allied forces provided close air support and used extensive artillery fire  Casualties were heavy on both sides  although Iraqi forces sustained substantially more dead and captured than the allied forces  Eleven Americans were killed in two separate friendly fire incidents  an additional 14 U S  airmen were killed when an American AC 130 gunship was shot down by an Iraqi surface to air missile  SAM   and two American soldiers were captured during the battle  Saudi and Qatari forces had a total of 18 dead  Iraqi forces in Khafji had 60 300 dead and 400 captured  Khafji was a strategically important city immediately after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait  The Iraqi reluctance to commit several armored divisions to the occupation  and its subsequent use of Khafji as a launching pad into the initially lightly defended east of Saudi Arabia is considered by many academics who   a grave strategic error citation needed   Not only would Iraq have secured a majority of Middle Eastern oil supplies  but it would have found itself better able to threaten the subsequent U S  deployment along superior defensive lines   edit  Ground campaign Ground troop movements 24 28 February 1991 during Operation Desert Storm  The Coalition forces dominated the air with their technological advantages  but the ground forces were considered to be more evenly matched  Coalition forces had the significant advantage of being able to operate under the protection of air supremacy that had been achieved by their air forces before the start of the main ground offensive  Coalition forces also had two key technological advantages  The Coalition main battle tanks  such as the U S  M1 Abrams  British Challenger 1  and Kuwaiti M 84AB were vastly superior to the Chinese Type 69 and domestically built T 72 tanks used by the Iraqis  with crews better trained and armoured doctrine better developed  The use of GPS made it possible for Coalition forces to navigate without reference to roads or other fixed landmarks  This  along with air reconnaissance  allowed them to fight a battle of maneuver rather than a battle of encounter  they knew where they were and where the enemy was  so they could attack a specific target rather than searching on the ground for enemy forces   edit  Liberation of Kuwait This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Main article  Liberation of Kuwait campaign See also  Gulf

abandoned near Kuwait City on 26 February 1991  For months  American units in Saudi Arabia had been under almost constant Iraqi artillery fire  as well as threats from Scud missile or chemical attacks  On 23 February 1991  the 1st Marine Division  2nd Marine Division  and the 1st Light Armored Infantry crossed into Kuwait and headed toward Kuwait City  They encountered trenches  barbed wire  and minefields  However  these positions were poorly defended  and were overrun in the first few hours  Several tank battles took place  but apart from that  Coalition troops encountered minimal resistance  as most Iraqi troops surrendered  The general pattern was that the Iraqis would put up a short fight before surrendering  However  Iraqi air defenses shot down nine American aircraft  Meanwhile  forces from Arab countries advanced into Kuwait from the east  encountering little resistance and suffering few casualties  Despite the successes of Coalition forces  it was feared that the Republican Guard would escape into Iraq before it could be destroyed  It was decided to send British armored forces into Kuwait fifteen hours ahead of schedule  and to send American forces after the Republican Guard  The Coalition advance was preceded by a heavy artillery and rocket barrage  after which 150 000 troops and 1 500 tanks began their advance  Iraqi forces in Kuwait counterattacked against U S  troops  acting on a direct order from Saddam himself  Despite the intense combat  the Americans repulsed the Iraqis and continued to advance towards Kuwait city  Kuwaiti forces were tasked with liberating the city  Iraqi troops offered only light resistance  The Kuwaitis lost one soldier killed and one plane shot down  and quickly liberated the city  On 27 February  Saddam ordered a retreat from Kuwait  and President George H W  Bush declared it liberated  However  an Iraqi unit at Kuwait International Airport appeared not to have gotten the message  and fiercely resisted  U S  Marines had to fight for hours before securing the airport  after which Kuwait was declared secure  After four days of fighting  Iraqi forces were expelled from Kuwait  As part of a scorched earth policy  they set fire to nearly 700 oil wells  and placed land mines around the wells to make extinguishing the fires more difficult   edit  Initial moves into Iraq Iraqi Tank knocked

intelligence on the movements of Scud mobile missile launchers  which could not be detected from the air  as they were hidden under bridges and camouflage netting during the day  Other objectives included the destruction of the launchers and their fiber optic communications arrays that lay in pipelines and relayed coordinates to the TEL operators that were launching attacks against Israel  The operations were designed to prevent any possible Israeli intervention  Due to lack of sufficient ground cover to carry out their assignment  One Zero and Three Zero abandoned their operations  while Two Zero remained  and was later compromised  with only Sergeant Chris Ryan escaping to Syria  Elements of the 2nd Brigade  1st Battalion 5th Cav of the 1st Cavalry Division of the U S  Army performed a Direct attack into Iraq on 15 February 1991  followed by one in force on 20 February that led directly through 7 iraqi divisions which were caught off guard  citation needed  From 15 20 February  the Battle of Wadi Al Batin took place inside Iraq  this was the first of two attacks by 1 Battalion 5th Cavalry of the 1st Cavalry Division  It was a feint attack  designed to make the Iraqis think that a coalition invasion would take place from the south  The Iraqis fiercely resisted  and the Americans eventually withdrew as planned back into the Wadi Al Batin  Three American soldiers were killed and nine wounded as well with only 1 M 2 IFV turret destroyed  but they had taken 40 prisoners and destroyed five tanks  and successfully deceived the Iraqis  This attack led the way for the XVIII Airborne Corps to sweep around behind the 1st Cav and attack Iraqi forces to the west  On 22 February 1991  Iraq agreed to a Soviet proposed ceasefire agreement  The agreement called for Iraq to withdraw troops to pre invasion positions within six weeks following a total cease fire  and called for monitoring of the cease fire and withdrawal to be overseen by the UN Security Council  The Coalition rejected the proposal  but said that retreating Iraqi forces would not be attacked citation needed   and gave twenty four hours for Iraq to begin withdrawing forces  On 23 February  fighting resulted in the capture of 500 Iraqi soldiers  On 24 February  British and American armoured forces crossed the Iraq Kuwait border and entered Iraq in large numbers  taking hundreds of prisoners  Iraqi resistance was light  and 4 Americans were killed  74   edit  Coalition forces enter Iraq Destroyed Iraqi civilian and military vehicles on the Highway of Death  Aerial view of destroyed Iraqi T

Kuwait Shortly afterwards  the U S  VII Corps  in full strength and spearheaded by the 3rd Squadron of the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment  3 2 ACR   launched an armored attack into Iraq early on 24 February  just to the west of Kuwait  taking Iraqi forces by surprise  Simultaneously  the U S  XVIII Airborne Corps launched a sweeping  left hook  attack across the largely undefended desert of southern Iraq  led by the 3rd Armoured Cavalry Regiment  3rd ACR  and the 24th Infantry Division  Mechanized   The left flank of this movement was protected by the French 6th Light Armoured Division Daguet  The French force quickly overcame the Iraqi 45th Infantry Division  suffering light casualties and taking a large number of prisoners  and took up blocking positions to prevent an Iraqi counter attack on the Coalition flank  The right flank of the movement was protected by the British 1st Armoured Division  Once the allies had penetrated deep into Iraqi territory  they turned eastward  launching a flank attack against the elite Republican Guard before it could escape  The Iraqis resisted fiercely from dug in positions and stationary vehicles  and even mounted armored charges  Unlike many previous engagements  the destruction of the first Iraqi tanks did not result in a mass surrender  The Iraqis suffered massive losses and lost dozens of tanks and vehicles  while American casualties were comparatively low  with a single Bradley knocked out  Coalition forces pressed another ten kilometers into Iraqi territory  and captured their objective within three hours  They took 500 prisoners and inflicted heavy losses  defeating the Iraqi 26th Infantry Division  An American soldier was killed by an Iraqi land mine  another five by friendly fire  and thirty wounded during the battle  Meanwhile  British forces attacked the Iraqi Medina Division and a major Republican Guard logistics base  In nearly two days of some of the war s most intense fighting  the British destroyed 40 enemy tanks and captured a division commander  Meanwhile  American forces attacked the village of Al Busayyah  meeting fierce resistance  They suffered no casualties  but destroyed a considerable amount of military hardware and took prisoners  On 25 February 1991  Iraqi forces fired a scud missile at an American barracks in Dhahran  Saudi Arabia  The missile attack killed 28 American military personnel  75  The Coalition advance was much swifter than U S  generals had expected  On 26 February  Iraqi troops began retreating from Kuwait  after they had set its oil fields on fire  737 oil wells were set on fire   A long convoy of retreating Iraqi troops formed along the main Iraq Kuwait highway  Although they were retreating  this convoy was bombed so extensively by Coalition air forces that it came to be known as the Highway of Death  Hundreds of Iraqi troops were killed  Forces from the United States  the United Kingdom  and France continued to pursue retreating Iraqi forces over the border and back into Iraq  eventually moving to within 150 miles  240 km  of Baghdad before withdrawing back to the Iraqi border with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia  One hundred hours after the ground campaign started  on 28 February  President Bush declared a ceasefire  and he also declared that Kuwait had been liberated   edit  Post war military analysis This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Although it was said in Western media at the time that Iraqi troops numbered approximately 545 000 to 600 000  most experts today believe that both the qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the Iraqi army at the time were exaggerated  as they included both temporary and auxiliary support elements  Many of the Iraqi troops were young  under resourced  and poorly trained conscripts  The Coalition committed 540 000 troops  and a further 100 000 Turkish troops were deployed along the Turkish Iraqi border  This caused a significant force dilution of the Iraqi military by forcing it to deploy its forces along all its borders  This allowed the main thrust by the U S  to possess not only a significant technological advantage  but also a numerical superiority  The widespread support for Iraq during the Iran Iraq War equipped Iraq with military equipment from most major world arms dealers  This resulted in a lack of standardization in this large heterogeneous force  which additionally suffered from poor training and poor motivation  The majority of Iraqi armored forces still used old Chinese Type 59s and Type 69s  Soviet made T 55s from the 1950s and 1960s  and some poor quality Asad Babil tanks  domestically assembled tank based on Polish T 72 hulls with other parts of mixed origin   These machines were not equipped with up to date equipment  such as thermal sights or laser rangefinders  and their effectiveness in modern combat was very limited  The Iraqis failed to find an effective countermeasure to the thermal sights and sabot rounds used by the Coalition tanks  This equipment enabled them to engage and destroy Iraqi tanks from more than three times the range that Iraqi tanks could engage coalition tanks  The Iraqi crews used old  cheap steel penetrators against the advanced Chobham Armour of the U S  and British tanks  with ineffective results  The Iraqis also failed to exploit the advantage that could be gained from using urban warfare   fighting within Kuwait City   which could have inflicted significant casualties on the attacking forces  Urban combat reduces the range at which fighting occurs  and can negate some of the technological advantages of well equipped forces  The Iraqis also tried to use Soviet military doctrine  but the implementation failed due to the lack of skill of their commanders  and the preventive coalition air strikes on communication centers and bunkers  Iraqi Type 69 main battle tank stands on a battlefield after being destroyed by Allied

the retreat of Iraqi forces from Kuwait as a result of Operation Desert Storm Persian Gulf Veterans National Medal of US military In Iraqi territory that was occupied by the coalition  a peace conference was held where a ceasefire agreement was negotiated and signed by both sides  At the conference  Iraq was approved to fly armed helicopters on their side of the temporary border  ostensibly for government transit due to the damage done to civilian infrastructure  Soon after  these helicopters and much of the Iraqi armed forces were used to fight a Shi ite uprising in the south  The rebellions were encouraged by an airing of  The Voice of Free Iraq  on 2 February 1991  which was broadcast from a CIA run radio station out of Saudi Arabia  The Arabic service of the Voice of America supported the uprising by stating that the rebellion was large  and that they soon would be liberated from Saddam  76  In the North  Kurdish leaders took American statements that they would support an uprising to heart  and began fighting  hoping to trigger a coup d  tat  However  when no American support came  Iraqi generals remained loyal to Saddam and brutally crushed the Kurdish uprising  Millions of Kurds fled across the mountains to Kurdish areas of Turkey and Iran  These events later resulted in no fly zones being established in both the North and the South of Iraq  In Kuwait  the Emir was restored  and suspected Iraqi collaborators were repressed  Eventually  over 400 000 people were expelled from the country  including a large number of Palestinians  due to PLO support of Saddam Hussein  Yasser Arafat did not apologize for his support of Iraq  but after his death the Fatah under the authority of Mahmoud Abbas would formally apologize in 2004  77  There was some criticism of the Bush administration  as they chose to allow Saddam Hussein to remain in power instead of pushing on to capture Baghdad and overthrowing his government  In their co written 1998 book  A World Transformed  Bush and Brent Scowcroft argued that such a course would have fractured the alliance  and would have had many unnecessary political and human costs associated with it  In 1992  the United States Secretary of Defense during the war  Dick Cheney  made the same point  I would guess if we had gone in there  we would still have forces in Baghdad today  We d be running the country  We would not have been able to get everybody out and bring everybody home  And the final point that I think needs to be made is this question of casualties  I don t think you could have done all of that without significant additional U S  casualties  and while everybody was tremendously impressed with the low cost of the  1991  conflict  for the 146 Americans who were killed in action and for their families  it wasn t a cheap war  And the question in my mind is  how many additional American casualties is Saddam  Hussein  worth  And the answer is  not that damned many  So  I think we got it right  both when we decided to expel him from Kuwait  but also when the President made the decision that we d achieved our objectives and we were not going to go get bogged down in the problems of trying to take over and govern Iraq  78    Dick Cheney Instead of a greater involvement of its own military  the United States hoped that Saddam Hussein would be overthrown in an internal coup d  tat

warplanes and cruise missiles led to controversy over the number of civilian deaths caused during the initial stages of the war  Within the first 24 hours of the war  more than 1 000 sorties were flown  many against targets in Baghdad  The city was the target of heavy bombing  as it was the seat of power for President Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi forces  command and control  This ultimately led to civilian casualties  In one noted incident  two USAF stealth planes bombed a bunker in Amiriyah  causing the deaths of 408 civilians who were in the shelter at the time  81  Scenes of burned and mutilated bodies were subsequently broadcast  and controversy arose over the status of the bunker  with some stating that it was a civilian shelter  while others contended that it was a center of Iraqi military operations  and that the civilians had been deliberately moved there to act as human shields  An investigation by Beth Osborne Daponte estimated total civilian fatalities at about 3 500 from bombing  and some 100 000 from other effects of the war  82  83  84   edit  Iraqi The exact number of Iraqi combat casualties is unknown  but it is believed to have been heavy  Some estimate that Iraq sustained between 20 000 and 35 000 fatalities  82  A report commissioned by the U S  Air Force  estimated 10 000 12 000 Iraqi combat deaths in the air campaign  and as many as 10 000 casualties

lost heart and started to evacuate occupied Kuwait  but airpower halted the caravan of Iraqi Army and plunderers fleeing toward Basra  This event was later called by the media  The Highway of Death   There were certainly a lot of dead vehicles  but not so many dead Iraqis  They d already learned to scamper off into the desert when our aircraft started to attack  Nevertheless  some people back home wrongly chose to believe we were cruelly and unusually punishing our already whipped foes        By February 27  talk had turned toward terminating the hostilities  Kuwait was free  We were not

who had earlier invaded Kuwait  Prior to the Gulf War  Palestinians made up about 30  of Kuwait s population of 2 2 million  102  The exodus took place during one week in March 1991  following Kuwait s liberation from Iraqi occupation  Kuwait expelled about 450 000 Palestinians from its territory  103  an event  which has become the second largest displacement of Palestinian Arabs ever  and is related as an ethnic cleansing  104  By 2006  only a few had returned to Kuwait and today the number of Palestinians living in Kuwait is less than 40 000  under 3  of the population    edit  Coalition bombing of Iraq s civilian infrastructure In the 23 June 1991 edition of the Washington Post  reporter Bart Gellman wrote   Many of the targets were chosen only secondarily to contribute to the military defeat of  Iraq         Military planners hoped the bombing would amplify the economic and psychological impact of international sanctions on Iraqi society        They deliberately did great harm to Iraq s ability to support itself as an industrial society         105  In the Jan Feb 1995 edition of Foreign Affairs  French diplomat Eric Rouleau wrote    T he Iraqi people  who were not consulted about the invasion  have paid the price for their government s madness        Iraqis understood the legitimacy of a military action to drive their army from Kuwait  but they have had difficulty comprehending the Allied rationale for using air power to systematically destroy or cripple Iraqi infrastructure and industry  electric power stations  92 percent of installed capacity destroyed   refineries  80 percent of production capacity   petrochemical complexes  telecommunications centers  including 135 telephone networks   bridges  more than 100   roads  highways  railroads  hundreds of locomotives and boxcars full of goods  radio and television broadcasting stations  cement plants  and factories producing aluminum  textiles  electric cables  and medical supplies   106   edit  Abuse of coalition POWs During the conflict coalition aircrew shot down over Iraq were displayed as POWs on TV  most with visible signs of abuse  Amongst several testimonies to poor treatment  107  Royal Air Force Tornado crew John Nichol and John Peters have both alleged that they were tortured during this time  108  109  Nichol and Peters were forced to make statements against the war in front of television cameras  Members of a British Special Forces group named Bravo Two Zero were captured whilst providing information about an Iraqi Supply line of Scud Missiles to coalition forces  only one  Chris Ryan  evaded capture whilst other surviving members of the group were violently tortured  110  Flight surgeon  later General  Rhonda Cornum was molested by one of her captors 111  after the Blackhawk she was riding in was shot down while searching for a downed F 16 pilot   edit  Operation Southern Watch Main article  Operation Southern Watch Since the Gulf war  the U S  has had a continued presence of 5 000 troops stationed in Saudi Arabia   a figure that rose to 10 000 during the 2003 conflict in Iraq  112  Operation Southern Watch enforced the no fly zones over southern Iraq set up after 1991  oil exports through the shipping lanes of the Persian Gulf were protected by the U S  Fifth Fleet  based in Bahrain  Since Saudi Arabia houses the holiest sites in Islam  Mecca and Medina    many Muslims were upset at the permanent military presence  The continued presence of U S  troops after the Gulf War in Saudi Arabia was one of the stated motivations behind the 11 September terrorist attacks  112  the Khobar Towers bombing  as well  the date chosen for the 1998 United States embassy bombings  7 August   was eight years to the day that American troops were sent to Saudi Arabia  113 Osama Bin Laden interpreted the Prophet Muhammad as banning the  permanent presence of infidels in Arabia   114  In 1996  Bin Laden issued a fatwa  calling for American troops to get out of Saudi Arabia  In the December 1999 interview with Rahimullah Yusufzai  bin Laden said he felt that Americans were  too near to Mecca  and considered this a provocation to the entire Muslim world  115   edit  Gulf war sanctions Main articles  United Nations Security Council Resolution 661 and Iraq sanctions Wikisource has original text related to this article  United Nations Security Council Resolution 661 On 6 August 1990  after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait  the U N  Security Council adopted Resolution 661 which imposed economic sanctions on Iraq  providing for a full trade embargo  excluding medical supplies  food and other items of humanitarian necessity  these to be determined by the Security Council sanctions committee  From 1991 until 2003 the effects of government policy and sanctions regime led to hyperinflation  widespread poverty and malnutrition  During the latter part of the 1990s the UN considered relaxing the sanctions imposed because of the hardships suffered by ordinary Iraqis  According to UN estimates  between 500 000 and 1 2 million children died during the years of the sanctions  116   edit  Draining of the Qurna Marshes Main article  Draining of the Qurna Marshes The draining of the Qurna Marshes was an irrigation project in Iraq during and immediately after the Gulf War  to drain a large area of marshes in the Tigris Euphrates river system  Formerly covering an area of around 3000 square kilometres  the large complex of wetlands were almost completely emptied of water  and the local Shi ite population relocated  following the Gulf War and 1991 uprisings  By 2000  United Nations Environment Programme estimated that 90  of the marshlands had disappeared  causing desertification of over 7 500 square miles  19 000 km2   citation needed  Many international organizations such as the U N  Human Rights Commission  the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq  the International Wildfowl and Wetlands Research Bureau  and Middle East Watch have described the project as a political attempt to force the Marsh Arabs out of the area through water diversion tactics  117   edit  Gulf War oil spill Main article  Gulf War oil spill On 23 January  Iraq dumped 400 million US gallons  1 500 000 m3  of crude oil into the Persian Gulf 119   causing the largest offshore oil spill in history at that time  118  It was reported as a deliberate natural resources attack to keep U S  Marine forces from coming ashore  Missouri and Wisconsin had shelled Failaka Island during the war to reinforce the idea that there would be an amphibious assault attempt   citation needed  About 30 40  of this came from Allied raids on Iraqi coastal targets  120   edit  Kuwaiti oil fires Main article  Kuwaiti oil fires The Kuwaiti oil fires were caused by Iraqi military forces setting fire to 700 oil wells as part of a scorched earth policy while retreating from Kuwait in 1991 after conquering the country but being driven out by Coalition military forces  The fires started in January and February 1991 and the last one was extinguished by November 1991  121  The resulting fires burned out of control because of the dangers of sending in firefighting crews  Land mines had been placed in areas around the oil wells  and a military cleaning of the areas was necessary before the fires could be put out  Somewhere around 6 million barrels  950 000 m3  of oil were lost each day  Eventually  privately contracted crews extinguished the fires  at a total cost of US 1 5 billion to Kuwait  122  By that time  however  the fires had burned for approximately ten months  causing widespread pollution   edit  Cost The cost of the war to the United States was calculated by the United States Congress to be  61 1 billion  123  About  52 billion of that amount was paid by different countries around the world   36 billion by Kuwait  Saudi Arabia and other Arab states of the Persian Gulf   16 billion by Germany and Japan  which sent no combat forces due to their constitutions   About 25  of Saudi Arabia s contribution was paid in the form of in kind services to the troops  such as food and transportation  123  U S  troops represented about 74  of the combined force  and the global cost was therefore higher   edit  Effect on developing countries Apart from the impact on the Gulf States themselves  the resulting economic disruptions after the crisis affected many countries  The ODI undertook a study in 1991 to assess the effects on developing countries and the response of the international community  A Briefing Paper finalized on the day that the conflict ended draws on their findings which had two main conclusions  Many developing countries were severely affected and while there has been a considerable response to the crisis  the distribution of assistance was highly selective  124  The ODI factored in elements of  cost  which included  Oil imports  remittance flows  re settlement costs  loss of export earnings and tourism  For Egypt the cost totaled  1bn   3  of GDP  Yemen was badly affected with a cost of 1bn   10  of GDP  while it cost Jordan 2bn  32  of GDP  International response to the crisis on developing countries came with the channeling of aid through The Gulf Crisis Financial Co ordination Group  They were 24 countries  comprising most of the OECD countries plus some Gulf States  Saudi Arabia  United Arab Emirates  Qatar and Kuwait  The members of this group agreed to disperse 14bn in development assistance  The World Bank responded by speeding up the disbursement of existing project and adjustment loans  The International Monetary Fund adopted two lending facilities   the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility  ESAF  and the Compensatory  amp  Contingency Financing Facility  CCFF   The European Community offered 2 billion clarification needed  in assistance  124   edit  Media coverage The examples and perspective in this section may not represent a worldwide view of the subject  Please improve this article and discuss the issue on the talk page   January 2010  The Persian Gulf War was a heavily televised war  For the first time people all over the world were able to watch live pictures of missiles hitting their targets and fighters taking off from aircraft carriers  Allied forces were keen to demonstrate the accuracy of their weapons  In the United States  the  big three  network anchors led the network news coverage of the war  ABC s Peter Jennings  CBS s Dan Rather  and NBC s Tom Brokaw were anchoring their evening newscasts when air strikes began on 16 January 1991  ABC News correspondent Gary Shepard  reporting live from Baghdad  told Jennings of the quietness of the city  But  moments later  Shepard was back on the air as flashes of light were seen on the horizon and tracer fire was heard on the ground  On CBS  viewers were watching a report from correspondent Allen Pizzey  who was also reporting from Baghdad  when the war began  Rather  after the report was finished  announced that there were unconfirmed reports of flashes in Baghdad and heavy air traffic at bases in Saudi Arabia  On the  NBC Nightly News   correspondent Mike Boettcher reported unusual air activity in Dhahran  Saudi Arabia  Moments later  Brokaw announced to his viewers that the air attack had begun  Still  it was CNN which gained the most popularity for their coverage  and indeed its wartime coverage is often cited as one of the landmark events in the development of the network  CNN correspondents John Holliman and Peter Arnett and CNN anchor Bernard Shaw relayed audio reports from the Al Rashid Hotel as the air strikes began  The network had previously convinced the Iraqi government to allow installation of a permanent audio circuit in their makeshift bureau  When the telephones of all of the other Western TV correspondents went dead during the bombing  CNN was the only service able to provide live reporting  After the initial bombing  Arnett remained behind and was  for a time  the only American TV correspondent reporting from Iraq  In Britain  the BBC devoted the FM portion of its national speech radio station BBC Radio 4 to a 18h rolling news format creating Radio 4 News FM  The station was short lived  ending shortly after the President Bush declared the ceasefire and the liberation of Kuwait  However  it paved the way for the later introduction of Radio Five Live  Two BBC journalists  John Simpson and Bob Simpson  who  despite sharing a surname  are unrelated   defied their editors and remained in Baghdad to report on the progress of the war  They were responsible for a report which included an  infamous cruise missile that travelled down a street and turned left at a traffic light   125  Newspapers all over the world also covered the war and Time magazine published a special issue dated 28 January 1991  the headline  WAR IN THE GULF  emblazoned on the cover over a picture of Baghdad taken as the war began  U S  policy regarding media freedom was much more restrictive than in the Vietnam War  The policy had been spelled out in a Pentagon document entitled Annex Foxtrot  Most of the press information came from briefings organized by the military  Only selected journalists were allowed to visit the front lines or conduct interviews with soldiers  Those visits were always conducted in the presence of officers  and were subject to both prior approval by the military and censorship afterward  This was ostensibly to protect sensitive information from being revealed to Iraq  This policy was heavily influenced by the military s experience with the Vietnam War  in which public opposition within the United States grew throughout the course of the war  It wasn t only the limiting of information in the Middle East  media were also restricting what was shown about the war with more graphic depictions like Ken Jarecke s image of a burnt Iraqi soldier being pulled from the American AP wire whereas in Europe it was given extensive coverage  126  127  128  At the same time  the coverage of this war was new in its instantaneousness  About halfway through the war  Iraq s government decided to allow live satellite transmissions from the country by Western news organizations  and U S  journalists returned en masse to Baghdad  Tom Aspell of NBC  Bill Blakemore of ABC  and Betsy Aaron of CBS News filed reports  subject to acknowledged Iraqi censorship  Throughout the war  footage of incoming missiles was broadcast almost immediately  A British crew from CBS News  David Green and Andy Thompson   equipped with satellite transmission equipment traveled with the front line forces and  having transmitted live TV pictures of the fighting en route  arrived the day before the forces in Kuwait City  broadcasting live television from the city and covering the entrance of the Arab forces the following day  Alternative media outlets provided views in opposition to the Gulf War  Deep Dish Television compiled segments from independent producers in the U S  and abroad  and produced a ten hour series that was distributed internationally  called The Gulf Crisis TV Project  The first program of this series War  Oil and Power was compiled and released in 1990  before the war broke out  News World Order was the title of another program in the series  it focused on the complicity of the media in promoting the war  as well as Americans  reactions to the media coverage  In San Francisco  as a local example  Paper Tiger Television West produced a weekly cable television show with highlights of mass demonstrations  artists  actions  lectures  and protests against mainstream media coverage at newspaper offices and television stations  Local media outlets in cities across the country screened similar oppositional media  The organization Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting  FAIR  critically analyzed media coverage during the Gulf War in various articles and books  such as the 1991 Gulf War Coverage  The Worst Censorship was at Home  129   edit  Technology The USS Missouri launches a Tomahawk missile  The Gulf War was the last conflict in which battleships were deployed in a combat role  as of 2011  Precision guided munitions  such as the United States Air Force guided missile AGM 130  were heralded as key in allowing military strikes to be made with a minimum of civilian casualties compared to previous wars  although they were not used as often as more traditional  less accurate bombs  Specific buildings in downtown Baghdad could be bombed whilst journalists in their hotels watched cruise missiles fly by  Precision guided munitions amounted to approximately 7 4  of all bombs dropped by the coalition  Other bombs included cluster bombs  which disperse numerous submunitions  130  and daisy cutters  15 000 pound bombs which can disintegrate everything within hundreds of yards  Global Positioning System units were important in enabling coalition units to navigate easily across the desert  Airborne Warning and Control System  AWACS  and satellite communication systems were also important  Two examples of this are the U S  Navy E 2 Hawkeye and the U S  Air Force E 3 Sentry  Both were used in command and control area of operations  These systems provided essential communications links between the ground forces  air forces  and the navy  It is one of the many reasons why the air war was dominated by the Coalition Forces  American made color photocopiers were used to produce some of Iraq s battle plans  Some of the copiers contained concealed high tech transmitters that revealed their positions to American electronic warfare air crafts leading to more precise bombings  131   edit  Scud and Patriot missiles The role of Iraq s Scud missiles featured prominently in the war  Scud is a tactical ballistic missile that the Soviet Union developed and deployed among the forward deployed Red Army divisions in East Germany  The role of the Scuds which were armed with nuclear and chemical warheads was to destroy command  control  and communication facilities and delay full mobilisation of Western German and Allied Forces in Germany  It could also be used to directly target ground forces  Scud missiles utilise inertial guidance which operates for the duration that the engines operate  Iraq used Scud missiles  launching them into both Saudi Arabia and Israel  Some missiles caused extensive casualties  while others caused little damage  Concerns were raised of possible chemical or biological warheads on these rockets  but if they existed they were not used  Scud missiles are not as effective at delivering chemical payloads as is commonly believed because intense heat during the Scud s flight at approximately Mach 5 denatures most of the chemical payload  citation needed  Chemical weapons are inherently better suited to being delivered by cruise missiles or fighter bombers  The Scud is best suited to delivering tactical nuclear warheads  a role for which it is as capable today as it was when it was first developed  The U S  Patriot missile was used for the first time in combat  The U S  military claimed a high effectiveness against Scuds at the time  but later analysis gives figures as low as nine percent  with forty five percent of the 158 Patriot launches being against debris or false targets  132  The Dutch Ministry of Defense who also sent Patriot missiles to protect civilians in Israel and Turkey  later disputed the higher claim  72  Further  there is at least one incident of a software error causing a Patriot missile s failure to engage an incoming Scud  resulting in deaths  133  Both the U S  Army and the missile manufacturers maintained the Patriot delivered a  miracle performance  in the Gulf War  132   edit  Alternate names for the Gulf War The following names have been used to describe the conflict itself  Gulf War and Persian Gulf War have been the most common terms for the conflict used within the Western countries  These names have been used by the overwhelming majority of popular historians and journalists in the United States  The major problem with these terms is that the usage is ambiguous  having now been applied to at least three conflicts  see Gulf War  disambiguation   With no consensus of naming  various publications have attempted to refine the name  Some variants include  War in the Gulf 1990 Gulf War Gulf War  1990 1991  Gulf War Sr  First Gulf War  to distinguish it from the U S  invasion of Iraq  Second Gulf War  to distinguish it from the Iran Iraq War  Liberation of Kuwait  Arabic               ta r r al kuwayt  is the term used by Kuwait and most of the Arab state members of the Coalition Forces including Saudi Arabia  Bahrain  Egypt and the United Arab Emirates  War of Kuwait and Second Gulf War appear to be the names commonly used in France 134  and Germany  135  Mother of Battles  Arabic             umm al ma  rik  is the term used by Iraq  Other names sometimes used include Iraq Kuwait conflict and UN Iraq conflict   edit  Operational names Most of the Coalition Force countries used various names for their operations and operational phases of the war  These are sometimes incorrectly used as the overall name of the conflict  especially the US Desert Storm  Operation Desert Shield was the US operational name for the US buildup of forces and the defense of Saudi Arabia from 2 August 1990  to 16 January 1991  Operation Desert Storm was the US name of the airland conflict from 17 January 1991  through 11 April 1991  Op ration Daguet was the French name for French armed forces  activities in this conflict  Operation FRICTION was the name of the Canadian operations Operazione Locusta  Italian for Locust  was the Italian name for the operations and conflict  Operation Granby was the British name for British armed forces  activities during the operations and conflict  Operation Desert Farewell was the name given to the return of US units and equipment to the United States in 1991 after the liberation of Kuwait  sometimes referred to as Operation Desert Calm  Operation Desert Sabre was the US name for the airland offensive against the Iraqi Army in the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations  the  100 hour war   from 24 28 February 1991  in itself  part of Operation Desert Storm  Operation Desert Sword was an early name for Operation Desert Sabre  In addition  various phases of each operation may have a unique operational name   edit  Campaigns The US divided the conflict into three major campaigns  Defense of Saudi Arabia for the period 2 August 1990  through 16 January 1991  Liberation and Defense of Kuwait for the period 17 January 1991  through 11 April 1991  Southwest Asia Cease Fire for the period 12 April 1991  through 30 November 1995  including Operation Provide Comfort   edit  See also Gulf War military awards
