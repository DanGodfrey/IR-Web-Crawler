greater responsibility to oppose that evil any way I can  So Tony Stark may have done his bit out there  but only Iron Man can do what has to be done       Iron Man   Early Life Anthony Stark  son of industrialist and inventor Howard Stark  demonstrated his mechanical aptitude and extraordinary inventive genius at a very early age  enrolling in the undergraduate electrical engineering program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at the age of 15  1  Double majors in physics and engineering were easy for him  2  When he was 21  he inherited his father s business  Stark Industries  and within a few years turned it into a multi billion dollar industry complex whose chief contracts were for weaponry and munitions for the U S  government  3  Iron Man is born  Added by ADour Inventing the Armor Stark went to Vietnam  recently changed to the Persian Gulf  to supervise a field test for one of his transistorized weapons  4  He ignored concerns that security was insufficient  Stark tripped on a booby trap and a piece of shrapnel was lodged in his chest  The gravely injured Stark was taken captive by the Communist leader Wong Chu  and was informed that within a week the shrapnel would penetrate his heart and kill him  Wong Chu offered Stark a deal  if he built the Communists a powerful weapon  Wong Chu would allow Stark to undergo an operation to save his life  Knowing this was a lie  Stark agreed  hoping to gain time and access to tools  Stark was given access to a small laboratory in communist territory with another captive  the renowned Oriental physicist and Nobel laureate Professor Ho Yinsen  With Yinsen acting as his assistant  Stark designed and built an electrically powered suit of armor equipped with heavy offensive weaponry  The armor also contained a pacemaker like device that enabled Stark s heart to keep beating after the shrapnel entered it  Donning the suit  Stark connected it to its power source  an electrical generator  Lying on a table Stark was helpless until the suit was fully charged  His captor  Wong Chu  sensed something was amiss and came to investigate with armed men  Realizing he was sacrificing his life  Professor Ho Yinsen went out to confront Wong Chu  to give Stark the extra time he needed to charge the armored suit fully  As the Iron Man  Stark avenged Yinsen s death and scattered Wong Chu s guerrilla troops 5  Then  still clad in his armor  which was necessary to keep his heart beating  Stark made his way to the jungle  trying to escape enemy territory  James Rhodes  a pilot in the United States Marines who was stationed in Southeast Asia  had been shot down in the jungle by communist rockets while he was on a reconnaissance mission  Rhodes managed to land safely and was attempting to get his helicopter air worthy when he encountered Iron Man  After Iron Man helped Rhodes fight off an attack by communist forces  Rhodes allowed him to drain the helicopter s batteries to recharge his armor  The two tracked through the jungle together  finally discovering a hidden communist rocket base  Stealing an enemy helicopter  they destroyed the site and flew to the nearest American base  Back in the United States  Stark redesigned his chest plate  which contained a pacemaker like device  reducing the chest plate s size and weight so he could wear it under his normal clothing  Required to wear the armor s chest plate at all times to keep his heart beating  Stark decided to put the rest of the armor to regular use as well  After redesigning the entire armored suit to match the lighter chest plate  Stark made the existence of the suit public  He concealed the suit s true origin  as well as the fact that he himself had to wear the chest plate to live  Stark made it known that he would soon manufacture the suit  which he called  the human machine   for sale to the public  Classic Iron Man armor Added by ADour Becoming Iron Man Soon afterward  Stark donned one of his battle suits in order to prevent thieves from stealing parts from the other copies of it  This experience made him realize that the suit was too dangerous to be made available to the public  The next day Stark revealed what had happened to him in Southeast Asia to Joanna Nivena  his then fianc   6  Together they attended a tennis match in Forest Hills  N Y  that afternoon  Stark brought along his armor  which he was taking to a nearby laboratory for tests  Terrorists who threatened to kill everyone present with a bomb invaded the match  Joanna urged Stark to don the armor to stop the terrorists  Stark did so  captured the terrorists and saved the spectators by throwing himself atop the bomb  Iron Man thus publicly became a hero  and Stark had a new sense of purpose  having decided to combat evildoers as Iron Man  Wishing to retain some degree of anonymity  Stark established the fiction that Iron Man was his paid bodyguard wearing a suit of armor that he had invented  Only his most trusted aides learned Stark and Iron Man were one and the same  At first Stark used his Iron Man identity mostly to combat spies  like the Actor 7   and criminals who threatened Stark Industries  like the Melter 8  or Mr  Doll 9   During this time  the original Crimson Dynamo attacked Stark Industries  but Tony Stark persuaded him to defect 10   Later  he expanded the scope of his alter ego s activities to battle any force or person who threatened the security of America or the world  Stark was instrumental in the organization and armament of the original global intelligence and law enforcement agency known as S H I E L D   As Iron Man  he became a founding member of Earth s Mightiest Heroes  the team of super human champions known as The Avengers 11   Stark donated his Manhattan mansion to the Avengers for their exclusive use Breaking his 100th issue Added by GhostSpider4 As an Avenger  Stark would go on to participate in many missions over the years  although he sometimes had trouble reconciling his private affairs with his responsibilities in the Avengers 12   With the other remaining founders after the Hulk left 13   he was among those who discovered the frozen form of the heroic Captain America  still frozen since World War II 14   He was also the Avenger who sponsored the membership of Hawkeye  a man whom he had skirmished with  after realizing his good intentions  Hawkeye was one of the new Avengers who joined when Stark and the other founders decided to take leaves of absence  15  Over the years Stark constantly refined and modified the design of his armor  From a bulky  transistorized iron suit  he eventually built a relatively lightweight  integrated circuit  magnetically polarized suit with more human looking articulated musculature  16  Stark s extraordinary genius in theoretical mechanics has enabled him keep his suit of armor state of the art  Stark eventually underwent heart transplant surgery so that he was no longer obligated to wear his metallic chest plate  For moral reasons  Stark eventually decided to stop manufacturing armaments and devoted his company to other areas of technology  17  Iron Man and the Illuminati Added by ADour The Illuminati In the wake of the Kree Skrull War  Stark initiated a meeting in Wakanda with Professor X  Mister Fantastic  Black Bolt  Doctor Strange  and Namor to form a clandestine  unnamed group to devise strategy and policy regarding overarching menaces  the  Illuminati    18  Stark s original goal was to create a governing body for all superheroes in the world to answer to  with him most likely being the head of that group by his mannerism during the meeting   However  the different beliefs and philosophies  besides the fact that many heroes chose to conceal their real identities  made Stark s plan impractical  Despite this  the group agreed to share vital information  Alcoholism and a New Iron Man In recent years Tony Stark s greatest nemesis has been alcoholism  19  As a wealthy socialite  alcohol had been a constant part of his life  When his company  which had changed its name from Stark Industries to Stark International  was threatened with the takeover at the same time he was experiencing oppressive personal problems  Stark began to abuse alcohol  Although he managed to recover quickly from his first serious bout  the compulsion to drink remained a constant temptation  The second time he succumbed to alcoholism  due to even more devastating personal problems than the first time  Tony Stark went on a several month binge during which he was cheated out of Stark International  had all Iron Man suits destroyed  except one   lost the leases on his various apartments  and had his personal assets frozen so that he could not touch his fortune  All of this was the result of the machinations of the mysterious European entrepreneur Obadiah Stane  who took over Stark s company  renaming it Stane International  During this time  Stark s friend James Rhodes  who had gone to work for Stark after leaving the military  assumed custody of the Iron Man armor and operated as Iron Man in his stead  20  When Stark finally regained his sobriety  he joined with Rhodes and two of his friends  Morley Irwin  late of Stark International  and his sister Clytemnestra Irwin of Richmond Enterprises  to set up a new electronics firm in California named Circuits Maximus  21  In its brief existence  Circuits Maximus became a prestigious and successful firm  While the armor was in his custody  James Rhodes became increasingly enamored with being Iron Man and  upon Stark s return to sobriety  feared that Stark would ask for it back  The cybernetic helmet had never been properly calibrated to Rhodes  brain patterns  he began to have severe headaches and his thinking was clouded  As a result Rhodes began to manifest hostility toward Stark  As part of his therapy  Stark constructed a simple suit of armor based on his original design with no intention of donning it until he felt in control of his alcoholism  When Rhodes began acting irrationally  however  Stark felt obligated to put on this crude suit of armor to prevent Rhodes from doing harm  Stark managed to subdue Rhodes and made necessary recalibration on the cybernetics  For a brief time Stark and Rhodes used their respective suits of armor as Iron Men  although Stark did so reluctantly  At the suggestion of the West Coast Avengers chairman  Hawkeye  Stark designed and built his most sophisticated armor to date  presumably so that the Avengers could find someone to wear the suit and bolster the team s strength  Battling Iron Monger Added by ADour However  soon after its completion  Obadiah Stane became alarmed at Stark s steps toward recovery  Circuits Maximus was bombed  injuring Rhodes and killing Morley Irwin  22  Desiring vengeance  Stark donned the untested new armor and sought out Stane  Stane himself put on a suit his engineers had built using Stark s plans  and met Iron Man in battle as the Iron Monger  Losing the battle against Stark  Stane committed suicide  Stark decided that although one is never truly cured of alcoholism  he could also not deny the responsibility of being Iron Man  He resumed his career as Iron Man  and joined the new West Coast branch of the Avengers  Founding Stark Enterprises Stark also managed to reclaim control of his fortune  although he decided not to claim ownership of the company formerly known as Stark International  Rather  he founded a new technological design and manufacturing company  Stark Enterprises  based in Silicon Valley in Southern California  Stark Enterprises quickly became a highly successful and innovative company  The Armor Wars Iron Man and The Armor Wars Added by Moshikal15 Stark learned that an industrialist calling himself Spymaster had stolen the plans for the many secret technological innovations found in the Iron Man armor  23  Spymaster had then turned these plans over to Stark s most powerful and antagonistic business rival  Justin Hammer  who in turn had made them available to criminals  These criminals had then incorporated the stolen technological innovations into their own armored battle suits  Outraged that his inventions were being used for criminal activity  and even for killing  Stark determined to deprive these criminals of his secrets  He planted a computer virus in Hammer s computer system that would wipe out all traces of the plans for Stark s Iron Man technology  As Iron Man  Stark sought out and caught many criminals and others  such as the United States government s Guardsmen  who wore a battle suit utilizing his technology  He implanted devices called  negator packs  on their armor to fuse the circuits  rendering the suit useless  With the computer records of the plans for his technology gone  presumably it could not be used in reconstructing the suits  Iron Man accidentally killed the second Titanium Man  also known as the Gremlin  in the course of these  Armor Wars   24  The United States government branded Iron Man an outlaw as a result of these and other vigilante actions  and his longtime Avengers comrade Captain America was among those opposing him  Stark publicly claimed that he had fired Iron Man in displeasure over his illegal activity  Shortly afterward  Iron Man was apparently destroyed in combat with government forces  In fact  however  Stark had survived  He created an even more sophisticated armored battle suit to wear as Iron Man using technology far more advanced than that which Spymaster had stolen from him  Stark continued to go into action as Iron Man  but publicly claimed that the previous Iron Man was dead and that another employee of his whose identity was being kept secret was now wearing the armored suit  Added by Jamie Stark Shot Later  Kathleen Dare  a former lover of his with an unstable mind  shot Stark  25  The gunfire severely injured Stark s spine and it appeared he could be crippled for the rest of his life  unable to walk  However he could still function normally within his Iron Man armor  A microchip device was later implanted in Stark s spine that enabled him to walk and move normally once again  This  bio chip  proved problematic and degenerative nerve damage occurred  This was aggravated by the attack of Kearson DeWitt  a madman who claimed Stark had stolen his father s designs  DeWitt had Stark s nervous system attacked with a techno organic virus  but Stark was able to survive  He temporarily had to be placed in cryo stasis  with Jim Rhodes taking his place as CEO  26  Soon after recovering  Stark was injured from feedback from a  telepresence  system to remotely control his Iron Man armor and battle Ultimo  Stark eventually recovered after extensive rehabilitation  Stark was forced to restructure Stark Enterprises when several of Stane s business decisions were leaked to the press  This also caused a number of other heroes to confront Iron Man  such as the Hulk regarding gamma bomb production plants  Stark also quarreled with Rhodes over several good intentioned but wrong decisions Jim made as CEO  such as selling off nuclear assets to a dummy company secretly operated by AIM   as well as his actions in Imaya  Rhodes was still angry Stark had lied to him about his nerve damage condition  The two briefly clashed  but have since resumed their friendship  Iron Man Armor Model 29  Added by Moshikal15 Frameup Later  while under the influence of Immortus  Stark committed a number of horrible acts and was temporarily replaced by a younger version of him  27  This was corrected when Franklin Richards brought him and the other heroes who sacrificed themselves against Onslaught back  When the replacement Tony Stark returned to the 616 Marvel Universe  he was merged with the 616 Tony Stark who was resurrected thanks to Franklin Richards  Shortly after returning he subjected himself to judgment by his fellow Avengers and was exonerated  Stark declined to challenge the Fujikawa acquisition and formed a new company  Stark Solutions  Injuries from battling the Mandarin and other foes revealed a danger of long term armor exposure  The armor s power systems and insulation were significantly redesigned to compensate  Jocasta s AI was recovered from Sunset Bain  The Sons of Yinsen  who became worshipers of his mentor and the Iron Man technology  contacted Tony  Sentient Armor During a battle with Blacklash during a storm  the armor became sentient  28  This would be later revealed due to the Ultron Imperative  Iron Man  Sentient Armor  decided it would replace Stark  but ultimately sacrificed itself to repair damage to its creator s heart  Stark posed as simple worker  Hogan Potts  at Askew Electronics  incorporating a new alloy called SKIN into his armor designs  After tests against the Shocker  he went into battle against AIM  the Ghost  and finally Ultron after the villain revealed his manipulation of the Sons of Yinsen  his role in the sentient armor  and corrupting the SKIN technology  Stark investigated an early military armor that had been distributed to rebel forces around the world  29  Temugin also made his presence felt  challenging Iron Man for the apparent death of his father  the Mandarin  A strange alien bio plasm was investigated in Las Vegas  30  Stark infiltrated the Thunderbolts posing as the Cobalt Man  31  Extremis Iron Man s Extremis Armor Added by Rcn The US military attempted to claim older model Iron Man armors  32  Their pretense was that Stark had not patented the technology and that he violated agreements made after the Armor Wars by continuing to adventure as Iron Man  At the same time  a new Secretary of Defense was needed  Stark vied for the position and halted a disaster involving the technology as Iron Man  Stark  later revealed to be manipulated by the Scarlet Witch  suddenly threatened a Latverian ambassador at a UN meeting  Clarence Ward used a stolen armor to kill nearly all of Stark Industries  board and Rumiko Fujikawa  In light of the incidents  Stark resigned as secretary  Stark returned to work at a hectic pace  often sleeping in his lab  A former classmate asked for help  a super soldier project named Extremis had been given to a small terrorist group  Iron Man battled the augmented terrorist Mallen  but suffered massive injuries  Taking Extremis  Iron Man healed and found himself able to directly interface with technology  especially the armor  Going after Mallen again  Stark was forced to kill him  Stark found he was becoming more and more aggressive battling the Crimson Dynamo and assisting the Avengers against Graviton  33  He also began building a group of drones nicknamed the Argonauts   Iron Man  was spotted attacking several officials  including those involved in his and Ho Yinsen s imprisonment  Stark agreed to go under watch  but armored up and escaped  He confronted Extremis  creator  only to learn the enhancement was not part of it  An outside force was controlling him  The Sentry was sent to apprehend Iron Man  only to find a remote unit and stopped via Tony s manipulation of CLOC  Stark tracked down the sender at a press conference  finding Ho Yinsen s son  He learned Yinsen had been forced to secretly implant a control chip in Stark during their imprisonment years ago  This chip operated on Yinsen s breakthrough in using electromagnetic signals to control the body  Operatives looking to steal the technology killed Yinsen s wife  In revenge  his son activated the chip  using Iron Man to go after those he felt responsible  A S H I E L D  sniper soon shot Yinsen s son  activating his fail safe  the Argonauts  The New Avengers While flying around the city  Iron Man arrived at the Raft prison to aid Captain America  Luke Cage  Spider Man  Spider Woman  Matt Murdock  and the Sentry in keeping prisoners in after a prison break  Tony was initially reluctant to make a new team but eventually agreed  The New Avengers went to find Karl Lykos and found out that S H I E L D  had been enslaving the Savage Land Mutates to dig in Vibranium mines  Next  The New Avengers found the Sentry and helped him restore his memory before going off to Japan to face HYDRA and the Hand  After they returned  the New Avengers revealed themselves to the world  After this  the House of M occurred  followed by a battle with the Collective  In between these missions  the Sentry was sent to battle Iron Man by the government  and Tony only defeated him by showing the Sentry several reports of disasters awaiting his actions  which caused the Sentry to collapse  Tony also tried to help Cap shut down the Young Avengers  only to help them fend off an invasion by both the Kree and the Skrulls over Hulkling  The New Avengers also attempted to apprehend the vigilante Cloak when he was framed for an attack on his partner Dagger  but were interrupted by the Runaways  who helped clear Cloak s name  Superhuman Registration Act Leading the Superhuman Registration Act Added by Copycat989 Learning of the government s plans to instigate a Superhuman Registration Act that would force costumed  super powered individuals to reveal their identities to the government and sign on as licensed agents  Iron Man at first sought to defeat the proposal  even going to such lengths as to hire the Titanium Man to attack the hearing on the act as he testified in order to manipulate opinion in his favor  However  at some point  Tony Stark s opinion of the Act changed  seeing it as a new means to achieve the goal that he had sought in forming the  Illuminati   and to tie the knots of friendship between humans and superheroes  34  He attempted to convince the other members of the clandestine group to support the new Act  stating that their input could prevent the Act from becoming too restrictive of superhuman activities  but all except Mister Fantastic rejected the idea of registration  After the Stamford  Connecticut disaster turned public opinion against super humans and fast tracked the Act into law  Stark came out publicly in support of the Act  but the new law split the hero community in two  All of Stark s planning and manipulation came to fruition as Stark then became the representative and leader of the pro registration side  placed in opposition to the anti registration advocates  In his first major public action as a supporter of registration  Stark again unmasked as Iron Man  Prior to the events of Civil War  Stark assisted fellow Avenger Spider Man and his family  Peter Parker came to regard Stark as a mentor  became his assistant  and accepted a new technologically enhanced costume from him  35  Stark also convinced Spider Man to unmask and go public with his identity as well  However  Peter s feelings of being manipulated and unease about the rightness of Stark s cause grew until Stark revealed a prison for super humans he and Mister Fantastic had built in the Negative Zone  When Spider Man attempted to escape from Stark Tower  along with his family  in order to join the Resistance  he attacked Stark  who had confronted him  However  due to Spider Man s override of the suit given to him by Stark and some unexpected intervention by the Punisher  the web slinger managed to escape with his family and was now considered a traitor by Stark and the Pro Registration side  Becoming Head of S H I E L D  Iron Man  Director of S H I E L D  Added by Moshikal15 Other incidents in which Stark was directly involved was the death of Goliath after being struck down by a clone of Thor  utilizing the Thunderbolts and other super villains as a task force to hunt down unregistered heroes and even using the Green Goblin as a weapon against them  Unknown to Stark  the Goblin was no longer under his control and was seeking his own agenda  however  Sally Floyd and Ben Urich allege that Stark himself who compromised the nanites in Osborn  an accusation that Stark did not deny 36   Stark went to the moon where the Sentry was visiting the Inhumans  37  He personally invited the Sentry to join his team  saying that he might not be around to see the end of the Civil War and he would need some stronger heroes to be there if this was to happen  The Sentry followed Iron Man back to Earth  where he supposedly joined his side  Director Maria Hill suggested that Tony might become the next acting head of S H I E L D  She cited his higher qualification than her  and the fact that it would  piss the right people off   Tony became very active in shutting down unregistered factions  frequently trying to arrest the New Avengers and pouring S H I E L D  agents into Los Angeles to capture the Runaways  Eventually  Captain America s group surrendered and was granted amnesty  with Cap agreeing to go on trial for his actions during the  Civil War   However  while in custody  Captain America was killed in an assassination orchestrated by the Red Skull  Stark was devastated by his friend s death  and left unsure on how to proceed  In a letter Steve had written before his death  he asked Tony to insure that the Captain America legacy lived on and to look out for Bucky Barnes  Tony was instrumental in getting Bucky to assume the mantle of Captain America  Iron Man and the other Illuminati were responsible for exiling Hulk from Earth  and were the people Hulk sought revenge on when he returned  Luckily  Stark saw this possibility as an eventuality  and was prepared to engage the Hulk with a brand new Hulk Buster armor  38  The battle between them destroyed most of New York City  and blows were thrown so powerful that no other hero could get close enough to help or act  Stark Tower collapsed on top of the two during the battle  and ultimately  Hulk took Tony captive to the Stadium with the rest of his captured heroes  Once all of Stark s sources  and comrades  were exhausted  he rendered the Hulk unconscious with orbiting military satellite lasers he helped install in his appointing as Director of S H I E L D  He had to draw money from numerous sources  most notably S H I E L D itself  to repair Avengers Tower and the several damaged buildings and structures of New York  When Thor returned he learned of the events of the superhero registration  Civil War  and was angered that Iron Man had waged war on the heroes who had been their friends and that Stark and others used his DNA to create the Thor Clone without his knowledge or permission  Tony began to fight Thor but it became obvious he could not win  Seeking a compromise  Stark rationalized that Asgard could be considered a foreign embassy  with diplomatic immunity granted to its inhabitants  Thor deemed this acceptable and the fighting stopped  During the Skrull Invasion Added by Moshikal15 Tony came to the remains of the X Mansion to talk with Cyclops  He informed the former X Men leader that the government was pushing to get the X Men registered  Scott told him there were no more X Men and that they were going to be registered for being born  39  During the Skrull Invasion Stark s armor was infected by an alien cyber virus which ultimately purged him of the Extremis virus  Stark discovered Spider Woman herself was the Skrull Queen Veranke who nearly deceived him to join ranks with her  He was saved by Ms  Marvel who upon Tony s request left him with Black Widow who acted as his defense until he could fix his damaged armor to a point to where it was fully functional  Tony led the heroes of New York against the Skrull invaders  His armor however  began to fail in midst of the battle forcing him to return to Avengers Tower for another one  The President of the United States was less than reasonable regarding Stark s action and ultimately removed Stark as director of S H I E L D  and disbanded the entire agency itself  Although the battle against the alien invasion had been won  Tony suffered a great loss  His technology was non functional  his corporations were in dismay  he had many new enemies  and little to no allies willing to help him with any of his problems  Dark Reign After the invasion  the U S  government also disbanded the Avengers  handing control of the Initiative over to Norman Osborn  Iron Man was later a member of Henry Pym s Mighty Avengers  40  Before fighting the threat of Chthon  Iron Man helped to subdue the Hulk  41  He left the team after realizing he was not yet ready to be a part of it  42  With his Extremis powers failing  Stark was able to upload a virus that destroyed all records of the Registration Act  thus preventing Osborn from learning the identities of his fellow heroes  The only copy of this database remained in Stark s head  while he was now on the run in one of his extra armors  43  and his remaining armors in Stark Tower were now in Osborn s hands  44  Iron Man managed to gain a new armor and fought Namor in the Stark Undersea Base  45  Stark was able to outsmart the Atlantean and escape the collapsing base  Osborn then placed a bounty on Stark s head  offering mountains of gold to the Hood s gang  The members of the secret organization the Cabal gathered to discuss many issues  among which was the hunt for Stark  Stark was losing intelligence by the day which slowed his thinking time and caused him to not be able to pronounce difficult words correctly  He started gathering and assembling parts to make his Iron Man suit easier to navigate and control as it was becoming more and more difficult for him to do so  He later abandoned it for the Dynamo Armor  which he borrowed from Dimitri Bukharin  46  Tony was later tracked down Pepper but the two were captured by Madame Masque  47  He managed to escape with Pepper s help  but was forced to leave her behind so she could fend off Masque  He then made his way to Afghanistan  but before he could reach his destination  he was shot down by Afghani militants  With his armor destroyed  Tony was forced to abandon it and proceed on foot to his destination  the secret laboratory that Stark worked with Ho Yinsen as a captive in developing the first Iron Man armor  Mark 0  Dusting off the outdated computer systems  Stark was able to reactivate the old suit  which was now the only armor simple enough for his deteriorating mind to operate  48  When Osborn personally caught up to the debilitated Stark and beat him savagely  Pepper Potts broadcasted the beatings  costing Osborn credibility and giving Stark public sympathy  Stark went into a vegetative state  having previously granted Donald Blake  Thor s alter ego  power of attorney  49  Stark Disassembled A holographic message stored in Pepper s armor revealed that Stark had developed a means of  rebooting  his mind from his current state prior to his destruction of the database  Blake and Bucky resolved to use it to restore him to normal despite Stark s offer in the message to stay in his current state if it would make things easier and Pepper s own uncertainty about the fact that Tony could come back when so many others could not  50  Added by Matthew Stanley Feldman The procedure on how to reboot Stark was very complicated  First  they had to place Pepper s electromagnet implant onto his chest  which would be fueling his entire biology  Then they jacked in the hard drive that Maria Hill recovered  which was a backup copy of his brain before he underwent the Extremis injection and then they activated the implant by channeling Thor s lightning through Captain America s shield connected to it  51  Meanwhile  in the last remaining vestiges of Stark s mind  he was in a barren wasteland  digging for the lost relics of his life  assisted by a couple named Howard and Maria  However  every time he found something  giant machines resembling his own Titanomechs would attack  causing the illusion to reset  He eventually found he was digging for an iron chest plate  resembling the 1960s version of his old armor   52  Back on Earth  Pepper  Rhodey  and Captain America sent in Doctor Strange to help Tony after the first attempt to revive him failed  The Ghost interrupted the doctor s ritual  but Tony Stark manually overcame his coma and used the Ghost s ghostphone to transport the assassin away  It was then everyone realized Tony s backup memory drive was not quite complete  as he was awed by the events he read about on his computer after the skirmish  which included the Civil War  Captain America s assassination  the Secret Invasion  and Dark Reign  Siege During most of the Siege of Asgard Tony Stark was out of commission  but suddenly returned wearing an older version of his armor  disabling Norman Osborn s stolen Iron Patriot armor and signaling the return of all three main Avengers  including Thor and Steve Rogers  After the Siege  Tony built a new model of armor with the help of Mister Fantastic  He also apologized to Thor for everything he had done  Later  Tony announced that he would make a new company  Stark Resilient  53   to rebuild his former wealth and to extend his repulsor technology as a civilian energy source  Iron Man s Bleeding Edge Armor Added by Rlchala Resilient After his reboot Tony  now with no company  decides to start a new company named Stark Resilient  Thor offers to give him treasures to fund his new venture  however he rejects it hoping to start from scratch  After working with Reed Richards on his new upgraded suit he pulls Stark from making government weapons  Pepper becomes his new CEO and informs business men that he wants to use his Repulsor technology to change the world and remove the need for oil and other fossil fuels  However he tells them that if they don t get on board he will ruin them  Angered by this  Pepper has a helicopter leave Tony  forcing him to use his new armor  Meanwhile the Hammer girls Sasha Hammer and Justine Hammer plan to fill in the gap in military technology left by Stark Industries with their own Detroit Steel  and not in a nice way  To make sure that Stark s new company doesn t get in their way  they hire Spymaster to kill Stark Resilient while it s still in its crib  They also buy and sell old Stark Tech and H A M M E R  weaponry and use some of it to fake a terrorist attack in Tokyo so their Detroit Steel could  defeat  these terrorists and come out victorious  Meanwhile making Iron Man and War Machine  who flew over there to see what s going on  look ridiculous in front of the cameras  Though they do not come home empty handed  Tony recognized the youngest Hammer girl  Sasha  as an accomplice to Ezekiel Stane who destroyed Stark Industries and nearly killed Tony  Meanwhile at the home front Stark Resilient has gathered a few misplaced geniuses to build him an Electric race car working on Repulsor technology from scratch in six weeks  And Pepper Pots wants her own Repulsor disc back in her chest and an armor suit to become the heroine Rescue once again  Tony is initially against this  but it seems he promised her this before his mind wipe  so he does what she asks and Pepper becomes Rescue once again  Tony hosts a gala in name of Stark Resilient and invites both Hammer girls  After an appearance together with Pepper  Tony takes off with Sasha Hammer  The Heroic Age In the aftermath of Siege  the super human registration act was repealed thanks to the efforts of Steve Rogers  who now took over the position of the overthrown Norman Osborn  Iron Man reunited with Thor and Steve Rogers and rekindled their relationship while setting their past differences aside  Iron Man and Thor were assigned to Avengers along with Bucky Barnes as Captain America while Steve Rogers headed the Secret Avengers  Iron Man was slightly troubled that he may not be able to take orders from Steve  but Steve told him that Maria Hill would oversee the Avengers  Added by ADour On the day the Avengers formed they were attacked by Kang who thrashed Avengers Tower and stated that the time stream was out of flux due to the actions of their children  Although  the Avengers were reluctant to believe him and dismissed it as a trap  they decided to confirm just in case  Iron Man along with the help of Marvel Boy were able to build a time traveling device and the Avengers split into two groups  one that traveled into the future to investigate and another that stayed behind to handle troubles in their current time  Iron Man traveled to the future and met his future version as well as Maestro who was an older Hulk  They worked together to figure out a way to fix the time stream  Tony was surprised at how much his older version was fascinated with time travel and that frankly he didn t share the same hobby  Realizing the only way to fix the time stream was for Kang to defeat Ultron  Iron Man went to Ultron who was powered with the Destroyer armor and reasoned with him to surrender  After Ultron realized the severity of the issue  and that his reign was not worth leaving the time stream out of order where Kang would continue to challenge him endlessly losing  he decided not to fight back and lost the battle  This fixed the time stream  The Avengers  next dire mission put them up against the Hood who had escaped from jail and attained the knowledge of the Infinity Gems  The Hood began collecting the gems and with two gems he easily defeated the Red Hulk  The Red Hulk  then went to the Avengers and asked for help  Upon hearing the nature of the crisis  Iron Man ran out half way into the Avengers meeting and contacted the members of the Illuminati  who were each responsible for the safeguarding of one of the gems  himself included  The group met and decided that the best course of action was to make sure that each of their gems was secure and that they will need their immense gifted powers in their confrontation with the Hood  As soon as they were about to leave and head to their duties  the Avengers arrived at their doorstep having tailed Iron Man and demanded answers to what they knew  The Hood escaped prison and started a search for the Infinity Gauntlet  finding the first one  the Reality Gem  at Attilan  Then he managed to get the Power gem from Reed Richards  Then Robbins was teleported unwittingly to the desert  where he found Red Hulk and defeated him  Red Hulk managed to get to Avengers Tower where he informed them of what had happened  Knowing it was about the Gems  Iron Man quickly flew away  where he met the Illuminati  with Medusa in the place of her defunct at that time husband Black Bolt  The first human possessing and using the Infinity Gauntlet Added by Drakolord7 The team went to the scene of the crime at Atillan to investigate  but where followed by three teams of The Avengers  Steve Rogers realized that this sort of scheme to secretly keep an immense source of power to be of Iron Man machination  He blamed Iron Man for this entire turn of events and threatened Tony that if he couldn t do anything about their current situation he would be kicked out of the Avengers  After explaining the situations  the teams united to search for the gems  The Avengers and the Illuminati divide to get the other gems  they manage to get the Time Gem  but the Hood appears after getting the Soul Gem  During the fight Red Hulk manages to get the Power Gem  but Hood escapes and searches for the Mind Gem  after getting it battling Xavier and other Avengers  is teleported to the Astral Plane to get the Soul Gem at the Astral Plane  There  Strange disguised as Thanos distracted Robbins until the other heroes arrived and Red Hulk attacked Robbins with the Power Gem  allowing the Avengers to take the Mind and the Space Gem  The only Gem that remained with Hood is taken from him by the other gems  which were in the Infinity Gauntlet with Iron Man  making him the first human to possess and use this artifact  Iron Man teleported Robbins back to Rykers  and faked that he wished the Gauntlet to not exist any more  Secretly  he gathered the Illuminati to share the Gems again  but now with Steve Rogers in the place of Black Bolt  On the day Tony was to public display his car  he was attacked by Hammer s foces and Detroit Steel  He found out that the drones were controlled by a cell phone application and with the help of his team was able to shut them all down  Tony was then able to focus on battling Detroit Steel who was trying to make his own publicity stunt by defeating Iron Man which would prove that the U S  Government would be getting a better deal with Hammer  than they ever did from Stark  as Stark had rejected to make anything for them  However  the battle proved fruitless for Detroit Steel and Iron Man was able to save the day  However  this was only a minor setback to Sasha and Justine Hammer who were able to form a partnership with both Ezekiel and the Mandarin for preparation towards their next confrontation  Versus Detroit Steel Added by Peteparker Having saved the day for now and his new company starting to shape up  he went to a local Alcoholics Anonymous meeting at the behest of Pepper to inspire confidence to those suffering from the condition  Things seemed to be going well for Tony but Doctor Octopus challenged him telling him that he had a bomb that would detonate most of the city if he didn t comply to his request  When Iron Man went to the location he met Doctor Octopus and recalled their early years as classmates  He challenged Iron Man to either remedy his current health condition or publicly admit defeat that he was unable to solve such a case  Tony stated that Octavius  past actions were catching up with him and that he needed to see a doctor which he wasn t  Meanwhile  Stark Resilient was also attacked by Electro and Sandman  who were sent by Doctor Octopus  However  Pepper proved to be quite a match for them and they ended up having to retreat  At the base  Doctor Octopus told Tony to beg him  which he humiliatingly complied with realizing that lives were at stake for the mere pleasure of the mad man  Doctor Octopus recorded the scene and let Tony go and stated that he had been outsmarted and that there really wasn t a bomb to diffuse  Tony flew back to his office to see if everyone was alright  Upon the positive turn of events  Tony and Pepper decided to enjoy themselves and were staring into the sunset when they witnessed something fast falling from the sky  Upon hearing that there were multiple such occurrences of such an event around the world  Tony went to Paris to investigate where one of the hammers had fallen and told Pepper to hire Bethany Cabe who dismissed the idea stating the Tony just wanted another redhead in his office  Tony told her that it was because she was resourceful and capable woman  Stark breaks his sobriety  Added by SerenityValley Fear Itself During The Serpent s bid to rule Earth  Tony fought Mokk in the streets of Paris  France  where all citizens had been turned into living statues Finding himself unable to defeat Mokk with conventional methods  Tony entreated Odin to allow him to design magically powered weapons in the forges of Asgard  Haunted by the casualties and his failure  Tony began drinking again  Then Odin appeared and after discussing with Tony  the All Father proposed to Tony to create magical weapons at Svartalfheim  With these weapons  the Avengers defeated the Serpent s Worthy and Skadi  while Thor defeated the Serpent himself but payed with his life  Days later  Tony destroyed the weapons at Svartalfheim and after discussing with Odin  the God brought back to life the  statues  of the Parisians who weren t broken  Also  Stark offered the dark elf Splitlip a place to work at Stark Resilient  Mandarin attacks Ezekiel Stane and Mandarin starts upgrading classic villains of the Golden Avenger and uses them to make acts of wars over the World  Meanwhile  Tony is doubted if he can really pilot the Iron Man armor  being cited by the U S  army  with help of his friend War Machine  Powers and AbilitiesEdit Powers Iron Man employs his repulsors  Added by Brian Kurtz While the armor is not on Stark still has some powers  due to the Extremis Virus  Psi Shields  Due to new S H I E L D treatments  Stark s mind is shielded from even the strongest telepaths  Direct Cybernetic Interface  Extremis has fused Stark s armor to his body  allowing him to store the inner layers of the Iron Man armor in the hollows of his bones as well as control it through direct brain impulses  and use some of its powers while not on  He has direct control over the communication devices  scanning equipment  and recording devices located in his helmet  Wireless Communication  He is also able to remotely connect to external communications systems such as satellites  cellular phones  and computers throughout the world  Superhuman Reflexes  The Extremis virus grants him improved speed reactions and movements  Regenerative Systems  He has the ability to heal himself and repair the armor  Iron Man Armor Iron Man s primary powers come from his armored suit  Suiting up the Iron Armor  The armor used to require several machines to put on the suit  in a lengthy process  Later  this was changed to having it in a suitcase  which shortened the suiting up time  but was not very effective on the battlefield  However  recently  it has been shown that Stark can hold the armor within himself  and use it when needed  and spring into action in mere seconds  Support Powers Superhuman Strength  He is capable of lifting up to over 100 tons when wearing his armor  Superhuman Speed  Even when not traveling for extended distances  the armor enables the wearer to move and react at high speeds  Flight  The armor can typically reach speeds in excess of Mach 8  in recent comics however Iron Man has been depicted as able to reach orbital velocities  5 miles per second  and up to speeds that can outrun black holes  Use of the jet boots provide enough power to lift a load of about 500 tons  Power Cells  The armor is powered by a combination of solar converters  electrical batteries and an on board generator that uses beta particle absorption as a fuel source  Not to mention the arc reactor that also powers the suit  Energy Conversion Power Recharge  The armor is also able to convert nearby or fare away energy sources  such as heat or kinetic energy or energy from the planet itself into electricity  or even drain energy directly into the batteries for recharge  Self Contained Life Support System  amp  Environmental Protection  The armor can be completely sealed for operations in vacuum or underwater  providing its own life support  and is shielded against radiation  Energy Absorption  The armor is also able to drain multiple forms of energy for its own use  Magnetism  The armor can use magnetism to pull or push metal objects at will  Artificial Intelligence  An internal artificial intelligence operating system that provides strategies  background information on opponents  and on surroundings and the current status of the suit  and prevents a lock on from targeting systems  Sensor Systems  Known sensors include radar lidar  night vision  and physiological medical scans that allowed Iron Man to take the vitals of other people  including heart and brain scans and monitors  These scans also provided Stark with real time personal physiological data  An all environmental scan for atmospheric content or life forms  including astral energy projections  often came in handy  It should be noted that the armor scans  radars  and environmental sensors were running at all times  recording everything Iron Man came in contact with  A magnometer was installed in the left wrist  while both gauntlets had atomic force microscopes installed in the thumbs and index fingers that were capable of seeing to the nano scale  Invisibility  Advanced composite ceramics  fused with a kevlar like polymer are backed by optical fiber networks  that  working in synch with an array of poly carbon head hologram generators cause the armor to be invisible to any form of detection  including night vision  infrared  and enhanced super human senses  To further thwart detection systems the suit houses an active noise reduction engine for silent stalking  And to achieve total silent running  the armor even stores the CO 2 produced by the wearer  releasing it through small vents only when circumstances are right  Holographic Decoys  Untraceable holographic duplicates of himself that are generated from the suit  They are projected in a way to look real  and show no trace of their origins  Spider Sense  Tony made a built in neural net that replicated Spider Man s pheromone based defenses  creating his own Spider Sense  It s unclear if Tony retained this power after the events of Stark Disassembled  Override  When required  armor systems including strength amplification  durability amplification  and repulsor Iron Man lifting a 16 000 Ton Nuclear Reactor Added by Tezehani intensity can be greatly increased  by bypassing safety circuits and limiters  However  there is a chance that this can result in a complete system failure of the armor  An example of this mode is when Iron Man easily lifted a 16 000 ton Nuclear Reactor  and flew into the sky and threw it into the sea  It seems that he utilized this resource on the Hulk once  as the armor ends up completely inert  54   The range of the Override can be controlled as only reaching his very limit and staying at it for a long time will cause a system failure  This range goes from a safe 800  to 3200   up to a very dangerous 5000   Defensive Powers Crystallized Iron Armor  The armor has evolved from a bulky iron suit to a molecularly aligned matrix of crystallized iron enhanced by magnetic fields over layers of other metals like titanium  creating a shell that is pliable  yet capable of amazing resilience and protection  Enhanced Durability  His armor is very durable  capable of withstanding tremendous amounts of punishment  It can withstand high caliber bullets with ease  He can also withstand rockets  missiles  torpedoes  high powered lasers  and such  taking little to no damage  Future armors were fully resistant against electricity  fire  heavy impacts  energy blasts  take zero Kelvin and up to the Suns temperatures  even some of Thor s attacks see Thorbuster   The suit can withstand almost unlimited kinetic and thermal impact  as well as most forms of radiation thanks to its refractory coating  The armor can survive anything short of a nuclear explosion at ground zero  The suit automatically protects its wearer when he enters an intrinsically hostile environment  such as outer space or deep sea  The armor even has specialized circuitry that guards against telepathic attacks  Tony is very confident in his suit s defensive abilities  when he was caught in a nuclear explosion  he was only thinking about women and completely forgot about what was happening around him  Energy Shield  Energy shielding that can protect the user from harm  It is also capable of reflecting attacks and staying mobile  At 2  power  the shield is strong enough to withstand a nuclear explosion  Offensive Powers Repulsor Rays  The armor s primary energy weapon  A particle beam weapon  standard equipment in the palm gauntlets  can repel physical and energy based attacks  traveling as a single stream or as a wide field dispersal  It s damage potential is extremely lethal  from being able to go through 2 inches of steel like paper to blasting a hole through a mountain  They can be powered up to make a larger beam or a Full Form Repulsor Ray  which does 360 degrees of attacks  The power of the Repulsor Beams can range from the basic ones such as the one from the Mark 3  which fires 2 gigawatt beams  to the beams on a much further model of the suit such as the Model 27 which fires beams in the high petawatt region  but those require a little assistance from outside  Unibeam  A powerful searchlight  capable of projecting beams in virtually every light spectrum  Also used as a powerful weapon that can destroy anything in its path  It fires a boosted form of the Monobeam with some Arc Reactor energy backing it up  Lasers  Standard lasers that can be used as weapons or for welding  Pulse Bolts  Extremely powerful plasma discharges that propagate in strength over distance  but implode if they get overloaded  Energy Blade  Based on the same design Tony Stark used to build Captain America s energy shield  this laser sword  emitted from his left arm  could also be flattened into a shield on his hands  or spread over the entire armor to encase the armor in a protective covering  Pulse Barrage  Pulse Barrage is one of Iron Man s standard long range attack  Because of its extremely low energy consumption  Pulse Barrage can be a very effective attack  an upgraded Red Pulse Barrage has the ability to penetrate through foes hitting others behind them  and the ability to ricochet off walls hitting more targets  Nanobots  Tiny nanobots can attack machines and tear into their armor  A certain variety used against aliens can turn their biological weaponry against them  Freon Stream  An attack capable of freezing the air  Smart Missiles  The Smart Missile is one that can target the weak points of a structure  object  or foe to inflict maximum damage with minimal payload  Missile Box  Similar to an assault helicopter rocket pack  holds several missiles of up to eight types rockets  including Anti Tank  Anti Ship  Spent Uranium Core Armor Piercing  Flame Bomb  Fire Suppressant  Smoke  Tear Gas  Radio Repeater and a Mini Nukes  Each type of missile can scan and target several targets at once and fire at a moments notice  The missile can also reach Mach 2 in under 5 seconds  Monobeam  A powerful beam used on early versions of the Iron Man suit  However  it s range was only a few yards  Fires a standard laser beam  Mini gun  This mini gun  used on the War Machine armor  can fire electrically primed  3 9 mm regular or spent uranium core armor piercing rounds in nearly 360 degrees  It can be set to fire between 1 and 1000 rounds per second  Gauntlet Mini canon  This variably configured gun contains eight kinds of specialty 3 9 mm ammo  Spent Uranium Core Armor Piercing  High Explosive  Concussion Type  High Temperature Thermite  Tear Gas  Tracer  Flare and Smoke  They can be switched in the middle of combat instantly  Tri beam  This version of the Unibeam runs on direct power from the Arc Reactor  draining it s energy rapidly if not fully charged  It has considerable knockback  Multi beam  As the name implies  the Multi beam can fire multiple energies at the same time  Generally used with the energy that Tony Stark has absorbed  Pentabeam  The Pentabeam has microwave lensing that allows for directed beams of high joule electrons  protons  acoustic energy  and neutrons  Omnibeam  Rather then only firing beam type attacks  the Omnibeam can generate heats at 25232 degrees Fahrenheit  extremely powerful lights causing irreversible blindness in the enemy  and emit ultrasonic attacks capable of stunning even superhumanly durable foes and even causing disintegration  The other way the Omnibeam is fired  is by absorbing or draining any energy in Iron Man s vicinity  drawing it into his chest reactor  and converting it into billions of petawatts and firing it  Hyper velocity Impact  The program Hyper velocity allows Tony to think and move at a much faster time frame then everyone else  allowing for quicker attacks  Also  it could create an electrical bubble if Tony is going fast enough  Vibranium  Vibranium could be used in several ways  mostly against things that are made of metal  Plasma Discharge  A plasma discharge is given off when the suit comes into contact with Vibranium  Iron Man s sophisticated suit of body armor  Added by GhostSpider4 Power Grids Official Ratings 55  Intelligence 6  Strength 6  Speed 5  Durability 6  Energy Projection 6  Fighting Skills  3 Fan Ratings Intelligence 6  Strength 6  Speed 6  Durability 6  Energy Projection 7  Fighting Skills  3 Abilities Tony Stark  mechanical prodigy  and his prized invention  Added by Harasar Industrial Genius  Quite apart from the powers granted him by the suit  Stark is an inventive mechanical engineering prodigy  constantly creating new technology and looking for ways to improve it  His intelligence is classed as above genius  He is one of the three smartest people on Earth  Furthermore  this extends to his remarkable ingenuity dealing with difficult situations such as difficult foes and deathtraps where he is capable of using his available tools like his suit in unorthodox and effective ways  Expert Engineer  He is an excellent engineer and mechanic capable of fixing almost  if not all  machinery  Expert Businessman  Stark is extremely well respected in the business world  able to command people s attentions when he speaks on economic matters by virtue of the fact that he is savvy enough to have  over the years  built up several multimillion dollar companies from virtually nothing  He is known for the loyalty he commands from and returns to those who work for him  as well as his impeccable business ethics  He also strives to be environmentally responsible in his businesses  and in one case  immediately fired an employee who made profitable  but illegal  sales to Doctor Doom  He states that if he wanted to  he could give away his entire fortune and build it up again within a week  Expert Tactician  He is a brilliant tactician capable of quickly formulating strategies and new plans should the situation change  Skilled Combatant  Stark was trained in unarmed combat by Captain America and has become quite physically formidable on his own when the situation demands it  He is also a great melee fighter while in the armor as a single punch is as strong as a solid steel ball traveling at 3 500 ft  sec  Indomitable Will  As evidenced by his two serious bouts with alcoholism and subsequent recovery  Stark is possessed of tremendous strength of will  never giving up and often emerging from defeat even stronger  It is arguable that the true  Iron Man  is not the armor  but Stark himself Strength level Without his armor Tony Stark possesses the normal strength of a normal human man his age  height  and build who engages in moderate regular exercise  Future issues have noted Tony to be transhuman and better than the finest human  and a technopath  being able to interface with anything electronic  satellites  computers  cellphones  alien technology etc    The armor amplifies Stark s strength to incalculable levels  enabling him to normally lift  press  roughly 100 tons  If sufficiently powered by an outside source  the armor can achieve massively higher levels Weaknesses Constant Recharge  Due to the shrapnel in his body  Iron Man must keep his suit charged at all times  often involving breaking away from a fight to recharge otherwise he would die  Although the shrapnel was later removed eliminating this weakness  the new chestplate that was used to bring him out of his coma has made him dependent on keeping it constantly charged again  due to it preventing his Extremis enhanced brain from being unable to contain any of his memories including remembering how to breathe after it was damaged when Tony deleted the Superhuman Registration Act files that he uploaded to himself  Memory Problems  Due to his recent memory deletion and the procedure that restored him  Tony Stark can no longer remember certain points of his life and the simplest things like how to tie a tie due to the process s side effects being greater than it was initially predicted  Alcoholism   Tony has been battling against his alcoholism due to the high pressures of running his company  mantaining his social profile  and being Iron Man  More recently  he started to drinking again when  because of the Serpent arrival on earth  he believed it was the apocalipse  ParaphernaliaEdit Equipment Armors  Iron Man wears a sophisticated suit of body armor containing various offensive weaponry  He has a number of suits aside from the current model  Some are mission specific or prototypes for testing  others are older models kept for nostalgia or for research  He has developed a special briefcase to carry his armor in  A few models are too big for the case and require a separate module  As the multi billionaire head of a global corporation  director of a global law enforcement espionage agency  and a genius level inventor  Stark can procure or develop additional technology as needed  Skrull Anklet  Which allowed him to shut down any psychic abilities Space Gem  As a member of the Illuminati  Iron Man possesses one of the Infinity Gems  previously having the Reality Gem  The Reality Gem and Avengers Identicard  Transportation When not traveling in his armor or using a Quinjet as an Avenger  Stark owns a number of vehicles  Some of them have been modified  such as a Ferrari capable of flight Weapons Varies by armor NotesEdit The identity of Iron Man was publicly revealed when Tony donned half the suit to save a dog from being run over  This was then later covered up by Stark claiming to have given up the suit with someone else now inside  The teenage Tony Stark was incorporated into the real Stark  Tony Stark is the first human to possess and use the Infinity Gauntlet  Mr  Fantastic wore first  but without using it   TriviaEdit Lee based Stark s personality on Howard Hughes
