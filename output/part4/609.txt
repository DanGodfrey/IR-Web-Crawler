correctional control was as follows  one out of 18 men  one in 89 women  one in 11 African Americans  9 2 percent   one in 27 Latinos  3 7 percent   and one in 45 whites  2 2 percent   Crime rates have declined by about 25 percent from 1988 2008  14  70  of prisoners in the United States are non whites  15  In recent decades the U S  has experienced a surge in its prison population  quadrupling since 1980  partially as a result of mandatory sentencing that came about during the  war on drugs   Violent crime and property crime have declined since the early 1990s  16  In addition  there were 86 927 held in juvenile facilities as of the 2007 Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement  CJRP   conducted by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention  10  11  As of 2009  the three states with the lowest ratios of imprisoned people per 100 000 population are Maine  150 per 100 000   Minnesota  189 per 100 000   and New Hampshire  206 per 100 000   The three states with the highest ratio are Louisiana  881 per 100 000   Mississippi  702 per 100 000  and Oklahoma  657 per 100 000   17  In 2009  92 9  of prisoners  not jail inmates  were male  17  A 2005 report estimated that 27  of federal prison inmates are noncitizens  convicted of crimes while in the country legally or illegally  18  However  federal prison inmates only account for six percent of the total

serious offenders  such as those convicted of misdemeanor offenses  may receive a short term sentence to be served in a local city or county jail  or to alternative forms of sanctions such as community corrections  halfway house  or house arrest  Different U S  prisons operate at different levels of security  ranging from minimum security prisons that mainly house non violent offenders to supermax facilities that house the most dangerous criminals  The federal government  states  counties  and many individual cities have facilities to confine people  Generally   prison  refers to facilities for holding convicted felons  offenders who commit crimes where the sentence is at least one year   Individuals awaiting trial  being held pending citations for non custodial offenses  and those convicted of misdemeanors  crimes which carry a sentence of less than one year   are generally held in county jails  In most states  cities operate small jail facilities  sometimes simply referred to as  lock ups   used only for very short term incarceration can be held for up to 72 business hours or up to five days until the prisoner comes before a judge for the first time or receives a citation or summons before being released or transferred to a larger jail  Some states have  unified  systems  in which all the jails and prisons are operated by the state  The federal government also operates various  detention centers  in major urban areas or near federal courthouses to hold criminal defendants appearing in federal court  Many of the smaller county and city jails do not classify prisoners  that is  there is no separation by offense type and other factors   While some of these small facilities operate as  close security  facilities  to prevent prisoner on prisoner violence and increase overall security  others may put many prisoners into the same cells without regard to their individual criminal histories  Other local jails are large and have many different security levels  For example  one of the largest jails in the United States is Cook County Jail in Cook County  located in Chicago   This facility has eleven different divisions  including one medical unit and two units for female prisoners  with each of the eleven divisions operating at a different security level  ranging from dormitory style open housing to super secure lock down  In the state of California  to prevent violence  prisoners are segregated by race  ethnicity  and sexual orientation while held in county jails and in the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation s reception centers  where newly committed prisoners are assessed prior to being transferred to their  mainline   long term institutions   edit  Duration See also  United States incarceration rate Main article  Criminal sentencing in the United States A judge sentences a person convicted of a crime  The length of the prison term depends upon multiple factors including the severity and type of the crime  state and or federal sentencing guidelines  the convicted s criminal record  and the personal discretion of the judge  These factors may be different in each state and in the federal system as well  The vast majority of criminal convictions arise from plea bargains  in which an agreement is made between prosecutors and defense counsel for the defendant to plead guilty to a lesser charge for a lesser sentence than they would receive if found guilty at trial  Some prisoners are given life sentences  In some cases  a life sentence means life  without the possibility of parole  In other cases  people with life sentences are eligible for parole after a time period determined at the time of sentencing  In some states  the death penalty may be applied  Death row inmates are kept in prison until their execution  Many legislatures continually reduce discretion in both the sentencing process and the determination of when the conditions of a sentence have been satisfied  Determinate sentencing  use of mandatory minimums  and guidelines based sentencing continue to remove the human element from sentencing  such as the prerogative of the judge to consider the mitigating or extenuating circumstances of a crime to determine the appropriate length of the incarceration  As the consequence of  three strikes laws   the increase in the duration of incarceration in the last decade was most pronounced in the case of life prison sentences  which increased by 83  between 1992 and 2003  20   edit  Violent and nonviolent crime 7 9  of sentenced prisoners in federal prisons on September 30  2009 were in for violent crimes  17  52 4  of sentenced prisoners in state prisons at year end 2008 were in for violent crimes  17  21 6  of convicted inmates in jails in 2002  latest available data by type of offense  were in for violent crimes  Among unconvicted inmates in jails in 2002  34  had a violent offense as the most serious charge  41  percent of convicted and unconvicted jail inmates in 2002 had a current or prior violent offense  46  were nonviolent recidivists   21  From 2000 to 2008  the state prison population increased by 159 200 prisoners  and violent offenders accounted for 60  of this increase  The number of drug offenders in state prisons declined by 12 400 over this period  Furthermore  while the number of sentenced violent offenders in state prison increased from 2000 through 2008  the expected length of stays for these offenders declined slightly during this period  17  Violent crime was not responsible for the quadrupling of the incarcerated population in the United States from 1980 to 2003  Violent crime rates had been relatively constant or declining over those decades  The prison population was increased primarily by public policy changes causing more prison sentences and lengthening time served  e g  through mandatory minimum sentencing   three strikes  laws  and reductions in the availability of parole or early release  These policies were championed as protecting the public from serious and violent offenders  but instead yielded high rates of confinement for nonviolent offenders  Nearly three quarters of new admissions to state prison were convicted of nonviolent crimes  Only 49 percent of sentenced state inmates were held for violent offenses  Perhaps the single greatest force behind the growth of the prison population has been the national  war on drugs   The number of incarcerated drug offenders has increased twelvefold since 1980  In 2000  22 percent of those in federal and state prisons were convicted on drug charges   22  23   edit  Recidivism A 2002 study survey showed that among nearly 275 000 prisoners released in 1994  67 5  were rearrested within 3 years  and 51 8  were back in prison  24  However  the study found no evidence that spending more time in prison raises the recidivism rate  and found that those serving the longest time  61 months or more  had a significantly lower re arrest rate  54 2   than every other category of prisoner  This is most likely explained by the older average age of those released with the longest sentences  and the study shows a strong negative correlation between recidivism and age upon release   edit  Comparison with other countries The stats source is the World Prison Population List  8th edition  Prisoners per 100 000 population

United States had less than 5  of the world s population 27  and 23 4  of the world s prison and jail population  adult inmates   7  By comparison the incarceration rate in England and Wales clarification needed  in October 2011 was 155 people imprisoned per 100 000 residents  28  the rate for Norway in May 2010 was 71 inmates per 100 000  29 Netherlands in April 2010 was 94 per 100 000  30 Australia in June 2010 was 133 per 100 000  31  and New Zealand in October 2010 was 203 per 100 000  32  A 2008 New York Times article 33  points out  Still  it is the length of sentences that truly distinguishes American prison policy  Indeed  the mere number of sentences imposed here would not place the United States at the top of the incarceration lists  If lists were compiled based on annual admissions to prison per capita  several European countries would outpace the United States  But American prison stays are much longer  so the total incarceration rate is higher       Rises and falls in Canada s crime rate have closely paralleled America s for 40 years   Mr  Tonry wrote last year   But its imprisonment rate has remained stable   Incarceration rate in the USA for federal and state prisons in 2007 was the highest in history of the country  34  It was 5 5 times greater than the sharp peak that occurred during the Great Depression at 137 per 100 000 in 1939  35  But historically  the current US incarceration rate is still slightly lower than the record high Soviet Union s levels before World War II when the USSR s population reached 168 million  and 1 2 to 1 5 million people were in the Gulag system s prison camps and colonies  i e  about 800 people imprisoned per 100 000 residents  according to numbers from Anne Applebaum and Steven Rosefielde   36  37  The Soviet Union s incarceration rates from 1934 to 1953 were historically the world s highest for a modern age country  according to The Gulag Archipelago book by Nobel Prize winner Aleksandr

Hispanics comprised 16 3  of the US population according to the 2010 US census  42  In 2010 black non Hispanic males were incarcerated at the rate of 4 347 inmates per 100 000 U S  residents of the

December 31  2009 the female prison population of federal and state prisons in the United States was 113 462  48  Within the US  the rate of female incarceration increased fivefold in a two decade span ending in 2001  the increase occurred because of increased prosecutions and convictions of offenses related to recreational drugs  increases in the severities of offenses  and a lack of community sanctions and treatment for women who violate laws  49  In the United States  authorities began housing women in correctional facilities separate from men in the 1870s  50   edit  Youth Census of

its youth than any other country in the world  a reflection of the larger trends in incarceration practices in the United States  This has been a source of controversy for a number of reasons  including the overcrowding and violence in youth detention facilities  the prosecution of youths as adults and the long term consequences of incarceration on the individual s chances for success in adulthood   edit  Aged The percentage of prisoners in federal and state prisons aged 55 and older increased by 33  from 2000 to 2005 while the prison population grew by only 8   The Southern Legislative Conference found that in 16 southern states the elderly prisoner population increased on average by 145  between 1997 and 2007  The growth in the elderly population brought along higher health care costs  most notably seen in the 10  average increase in state prison budgets from 2005 to 2006  The SLC expects the percentage of elderly prisoners relative to the overall prison population to continue to rise  Ronald Aday  a professor of aging studies at Middle Tennessee State University and author of Aging Prisoners  Crisis in American Corrections  concurs  One out of six prisoners in California is serving a life sentence  Aday predicts that by 2020 16  percent of those serving life sentences will be elderly  51  52  State governments pay all of their inmates  housing costs which significantly increase as prisoners age  Inmates are unable to apply for Medicare and Medicaid  Most Departments of Correction report spending more than 10 percent of the annual budget on elderly care  51  52   edit  Operational  edit  Security levels In various  but not all  state s department of corrections  inmates reside in different facilities that vary by security level  especially in security measures  administration of inmates  type of housing  and weapons and tactics used by corrections officers  The federal government s Bureau of Prisons uses a numbered scale from one to five to represent the security level  Level five is the most secure  while level one is the least  State prison systems operate similar systems  California  for example  classifies its facilities from Reception Center through Levels I through V  minimum to maximum security  to specialized high security units  all considered Level V  including Security Housing Unit  SHU  California s version of supermax and related units  As a general rule  county jails  detention centers  and reception centers  where new commitments are first held either while awaiting trial or before being transferred to  mainline  institutions to serve out their sentences  operate at a relatively high level of security  usually close security or higher  Supermax prison facilities provide the highest level of prison security  These units hold those considered the most dangerous inmates  These include inmates who have committed assaults  murders  or other serious violations in less secure facilities  and inmates known to be or accused of being prison gang members  Most states have either a supermax section of a prison facility or an entire prison facility designated as a supermax  The United States Federal Bureau of Prisons operates a federal supermax  ADX Florence  located in Florence  Colorado  also known as the  Alcatraz of the Rockies  and widely considered to be perhaps the most secure prison in the United States  ADX Florence has a standard supermax section where assaultive  violent  and gang related inmates are kept under normal supermax conditions of 23 hour confinement and abridged amenities  ADX Florence is considered to be of a security level above that of all other prisons in the United States  at least in the  ideological  ultramax part of it  which features permanent  24 hour solitary confinement with rare human contacts or opportunity to earn better conditions through good behavior  In a maximum security prison or area  all prisoners have individual cells with sliding doors controlled from a secure remote control station  Prisoners are allowed out of their cells one out of twenty four hours  When out of their cells  prisoners remain in the cell block or an exterior cage  Movement out of the cell block or  pod  is tightly restricted using restraints and escorts by correctional officers  Under close security  prisoners usually have one  or two person cells operated from a remote control station  Each cell has its own toilet and sink  Inmates may leave their cells for work assignments or correctional programs and otherwise may be allowed in a common area in the cellblock or an exercise yard  The fences are generally double fences with watchtowers housing armed guards  plus often a third  lethal current electric fence in the middle  Prisoners that fall into the medium security group may sleep in dormitories on bunk beds with lockers to store their possessions  They may have communal showers  toilets and sinks  Dormitories are locked at night with one or more correctional officers supervising  There is less supervision over the internal movements of prisoners  The perimeter is generally double fenced and regularly patrolled  Prisoners in minimum security facilities are considered to pose little physical risk to the public and are mainly non violent  white collar criminals   Minimum security prisoners live in less secure dormitories  which are regularly patrolled by correctional officers  As in medium security facilities  they have communal showers  toilets  and sinks  A minimum security facility generally has a single fence that is watched  but not patrolled  by armed guards  At facilities in very remote and rural areas  there may be no fence at all  Prisoners may often work on community projects  such as roadside litter cleanup with the state department of transportation or wilderness conservation  Many minimum security facilities are small camps located in or near military bases  larger prisons  outside the security perimeter  or other government institutions to provide a convenient supply of convict labor to the institution  Many states allow persons in minimum security facilities access to the Internet   edit  Correspondence Research indicates that inmates who maintain contact with family and friends in the outside world are less likely to be convicted of further crimes and usually have an easier reintegration period back into society  Many institutions encourage friends and families to send letters  especially when they are unable to visit regularly  However  guidelines exist as to what constitutes acceptable mail  and these policies are strictly enforced  Mail sent to inmates in violation of prison policies can cost inmates  gain time  clarification needed  and even lead to punishment  Most Department of Corrections websites provide detailed information regarding mail policies  These rules can even vary within a single prison depending on which part of the prison an inmate is housed  For example  death row and maximum security inmates are usually under stricter mail guidelines for security reasons  There have been several notable challenges to prison corresponding services  The Missouri Department of Corrections  DOC  stated that effective June 1  2007  inmates would be prohibited from using pen pal websites  citing concerns that inmates were using them to solicit money and defraud the public  53  Service providers such as WriteAPrisoner com  together with the ACLU  plan to challenge the ban in Federal Court  Similar bans on an inmate s rights or a website s right to post such information has been ruled unconstitutional in other courts  citing First Amendment freedoms  54  Some faith based initiatives promote the positive effects of correspondence on inmates  and some have made efforts to help ex offenders reintegrate into society through job placement assistance  55  Inmates  ability to mail letters to other inmates has been limited by the courts  56  Inmate correspondence with members of society is typically encouraged because of the positive impact it can have on inmates  albeit under the guidelines of each institution and availability of letter writers   edit  Conditions See also  Prison rape in the United States Overcrowding in California State Prison  July 19  2006  57  The non governmental organization Human Rights Watch raised concerns with prisoner rape and medical care for inmates  58  In a survey of 1 788 male inmates in Midwestern prisons by Prison Journal  about 21  claimed they had been coerced or pressured into sexual activity during their incarceration  and 7  claimed that they had been raped in their current facility  59  In August 2003  a Harper s article by Wil S  Hylton estimated that  somewhere between 20 and 40  of American prisoners are  at this very moment  infected with hepatitis C   60  Prisons may outsource medical care to private companies such as Correctional Medical Services  which  according to Hylton s research  try to minimize the amount of care given to prisoners in order to maximize profits  61  Also identified as an issue within the prison system is gang violence  because many gang members retain their gang identity and affiliations when imprisoned  Segregation of identified gang members from the general population of inmates  with different gangs being housed in separate units often results in the imprisonment of these gang members with their friends and criminal cohorts  Some feel this has the effect of turning prisons into  institutions of higher criminal learning   62  Many prisons in the United States are overcrowded  For example  California s 33 prisons have a total capacity of 100 000  but they hold 170 000 inmates  63  Many prisons in California and around the country are forced to turn old gymnasiums and classrooms into huge bunkhouses for inmates  They do this by placing hundreds of bunk beds next to one another  in these gyms  without any type of barriers to keep inmates separated  In California  the inadequate security engendered by this situation  coupled with insufficient staffing levels  have led to increased violence and a prison health system that causes one death a week  This situation has led the courts to order California to release of 27  of the current prison population  citing the Eighth Amendment s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment  64  The three judge court considering requests by the Plata v  Schwarzenegger and Coleman v  Schwarzenegger courts found California s prisons have become criminogenic as a result of overcrowding  65  In 2005  the Supreme Court of the United States case of Cutter v  Wilkinson established that prisons that received federal funds could not deny prisoners accommodations necessary for religious practices  According to a Supreme Court ruling issued on May 23  2011  California   which has the highest overcrowding rate of any prison system in the country   must alleviate overcrowding in the state s prisons  reducing the prisoner population by 30 000 over the next two years  66  67   edit  Privatization Main article  Private prisons in the United States In recent years  there has been much debate over the privatization of prisons  Both publicly provided and publicly financed prisons operate under the supervision of the Department of Corrections that exists at the state and federal level  The Department of Corrections fits the definition of a bureaucracy because it produces an output that is not measured or priced on a per unit basis and it obtains revenue from sources other than sales of an output  The concern in this case is that the bureau will not operate at the efficient budget  or where the public s marginal demand for prison services meets the least marginal cost of operations  The prisons can offer to implement more inmate programs or costly security enhancements out to the level where the consumer surplus is depleted  The same result can happen if the prisons argue that the marginal cost is in fact higher than it actually is by taking advantage of the budget approving legislators  lack of information  In this scenario the level of output is unchanged but the prison is receiving more funds than is necessary for an efficient outcome  Because public managers are under less pressure than their private industry counterparts when it comes to profitability and bankruptcy concerns  there is a risk that they may not run their operation as efficiently  Allowing for publicly financed but privately provided prisons eliminates much of the concern about a bureaucracy operating in a manner that may be viewed as wasteful  The introduction of competition that accompanies private contracting creates market pressures that encourage private managers to seek more cost effective means of operating  Travis Snelling of the Corrections Corporation of America notes that his prisons are designed to save on labor  which represents 70  of the total costs over the useful life of a prison  Snelling estimates   If you can eliminate one post by your architectural design  just one  that ll save you well over  100 000 in a given marketplace  as far as labor is concerned   68  Privately run prisons have greater flexibility in determining their labor force and salaries  which is more complicated with civil servants working in a publicly run prison  Competition can also allow for greater accountability and oversight  As long as there is more than one private contracting firm  then if the public is not satisfied with the performance or costs they can look to replace the current private firm with another  However  there could exist a conflict of interest by the profit driven  privately run prisons to provide programs that might lower recidivism rates because the lower prison population will then lower the profit margin  citation needed  California houses inmates in both private contract and public agency operated facilities  Contract beds cost about  25 000 less to operate than a standard prison bed  About 48 000 prison beds are occupied by low level offenders who are in prison only because of a chronic jail bed shortage  clarification needed  The State would reduce the prison budget by about  1 billion dollars annually if all the low level offenders were placed in contract facilities  citation needed  A study was performed using three comparable Louisiana medium security prisons  two of which were privately run by different corporations and the third was publicly run  The authors report the data from this study suggests the privately run prisons operated more cost effectively without sacrificing the safety of inmates and staff  They conclude the privately run prisons had a lower cost per inmate  fewer critical incidents  safer environment for employees and inmates  and a higher proportional rate of inmates who complete basic education  literacy  and vocational training courses  However  the publicly run prison outperformed the privately run prisons in areas such as less escape attempts  controlling substance abuse through testing  offered a wider range of educational and vocational courses  and provided a broader range of treatment  recreation  social services  and habilitative services  69  The results of this study show why this issue is complicated without an obvious solution  The privately run prisons were found to be a cheaper alternative without diminishing the level of safety and generating a higher completion rate of the offered educational vocational programs  But  the publicly run prison offered more services that suggest a larger commitment beyond guarding and housing inmates  Controversy has surrounded the privatization of prisons with the landmark Arizona SB 1070 law  This law was written by Arizona State Congressman Russell Pearce and the Prison Corporation of America in the Grand Hyatt in Washington  D C  70  There the group decided to turn an idea to house illegal immigrants in jail to model legislation that is almost word for word the Arizona SB 1070 law  Companies operating in the private prison business include the Corrections Corporation of America  the GEO Group  Inc   Management and Training Corporation  and Community Education Centers  The GEO Group was formerly known as Wackenhut Securities  and includes the Cornell Companies  which merged with GEO in 2010  Private companies which provide services to prisons combine in the American Correctional Association  which advocates legislation favorable to the industry  Such private companies comprise what has been termed the Prison industrial complex   edit  Employment About 17  of prisoners are employed by UNICOR 71  It is estimated that 1 in 9 state government employees works in corrections  72  As the overall U S  prison population declined in 2010  states are closing prisons  For instance  Virginia has removed 11 prisons since 2009  Like other small towns  Boydton in Virginia has to contend with unemployment woes resulting from the closure of the Mecklenburg Correctional Center  73   edit  Cost U S  Bureau of Justice Statistics  To view the data  74  In 2006   68 747 203 000 was spent on corrections  74  In 2005  it cost an average of  23 876 dollars per state prisoner  State prison spending varied widely  from  45 000 a year in Rhode Island to  13 000 in Louisiana  12  72  In California in 2009  it cost an average of  47 102 a year to incarcerate an inmate in state prison  From 2001 to 2009  the average annual cost increased by about  19 500  75  In 2001 among facilities operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons  it cost  22 632 per inmate  or  62 01 per day  76  Housing the approximately 500 000 people in jail in the USA awaiting trial who cannot afford bail costs  9 billion a year  77  Most jail inmates are petty  nonviolent offenders  Twenty years ago most nonviolent defendants were released on their own recognizance  trusted to show up at trial   Now most are given bail  and most pay a bail bondsman to afford it  78  62  of local jail inmates are awaiting trial  19  To ease jail overcrowding over 10 counties every year consider building new jails  As an example Lubbock County  Texas has decided to build a  110 million megajail to ease jail overcrowding  Jail costs an average of  60 a day nationally  78  79  In Broward County  Florida supervised pretrial release costs about  7 a day per person while jail costs  115 a day  The jail system costs a quarter of every county tax dollar in Broward County  and is the single largest expense to the county taxpayer  80  Bondsmen have lobbied to cut back local pretrial programs from Texas to California  pushed for legislation in four states limiting pretrial s resources  and lobbied Congress so that they won t have to pay the bond if the defendant commits a new crime  Behind them  the bondsmen have powerful special interest group and millions of dollars  Pretrial release agencies have a smattering of public employees and the remnants of their once thriving programs   National Public Radio  January 22  2010  80  The National Association of State Budget Officers reports   In fiscal 2009  corrections spending represented 3 4 percent of total state spending and 7 2 percent of general fund spending   They also report   Some states exclude certain items when reporting corrections expenditures  Twenty one states wholly or partially excluded juvenile delinquency counseling from their corrections figures and fifteen states wholly or partially excluded spending on juvenile institutions  Seventeen states wholly or partially excluded spending on drug abuse rehabilitation centers and forty one states wholly or partially excluded spending on institutions for the criminally insane  Twenty two states wholly or partially excluded aid to local governments for jails  For details  see Table 36   81  As of 2007 the cost of medical care for inmates was growing by 10 percent annually  12  72   edit  Criticism High rates of incarceration may be due to sentence length  Shorter sentences may even diminish the criminal culture by possibly reducing re arrest rates for first time convicts  82  The U S  Congress has ordered federal judges to make imprisonment decisions  recognizing that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation   83  Critics have lambasted the United States for incarcerating a large number of non violent and victimless offenders  84  85  half of all persons incarcerated under state jurisdiction are for non violent offenses  and 20  are incarcerated for drug offenses  in state prisons  federal prison percentages are higher   41  86   Human Rights Watch believes the extraordinary rate of incarceration in the United States wreaks havoc on individuals  families and communities  and saps the strength of the nation as a whole   84  The population of inmates housed in prisons and jails in the United States exceeds 2 million  with the per capita incarceration population higher than that officially reported by any other country  72 Criminal justice policy in the United States has also been criticized for a number of other reasons  87  Reporting at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association  August 3  2008   Becky Pettit  associate professor of sociology from the University of Washington and Bryan Sykes  a UW post doctoral researcher  revealed that the mammoth increase in the United States  prison population since the 1970s is having profound demographic consequences that affect 1 in 50 Americans  Drawing data from a variety of sources that looked at prison and general populations  the researchers found that the boom in prison population is hiding lowered rates of fertility and increased rates of involuntary migration to rural areas and morbidity that is marked by a greater exposure to and risk of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV or AIDS  88   edit  Penal system organization The penal system of the United States is operated at both the federal  state  and territorial levels  Each system exists in a separate but related historical and legal context from the others  Federal prisoners have been convicted of federal crimes  state prisoners  of crimes
