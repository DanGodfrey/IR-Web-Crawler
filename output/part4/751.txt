under one corporation to form Edison General Electric  At about the same time  Thomson Houston Electric Company  under the leadership of Charles Coffin  gained access to a number of key patents through the acquisition of a number of competitors  Subsequently  General Electric was formed by the 1892 merger of Edison General Electric of Schenectady  New York and Thomson Houston Electric Company of Lynn  Massachusetts and both plants remain in operation under the GE banner to this day  10  The company was incorporated in New York  with the Schenectady plant as headquarters for many years thereafter  Around the same time  General Electric s Canadian counterpart  Canadian General Electric  was formed   edit  Public company In 1896  General Electric was one of the original 12 companies listed on the newly formed Dow Jones Industrial Average and still remains after 115 years  the only one remaining on the Dow index  23 Ton diesel electric locomotive made at the General

of America  RCA  was founded by GE in 1919 to further international radio  GE used RCA as its retail arm for radio sales from 1919  when GE began production  until separation in 1930  11  RCA would quickly grow into an industrial giant of its own   edit  Power generation See also  GE Wind Energy GE s long history of working with turbines in the power generation field gave them the engineering know how to move into the new field of aircraft turbosuperchargers  Led by Sanford Alexander Moss  GE introduced the first superchargers during World War I  and continued to develop them during the Interwar period  Superchargers became indispensable in the years immediately prior to World War II  and GE was the world leader in exhaust driven supercharging when the war started  This experience  in turn  made GE a natural selection to develop the Whittle W 1 jet engine that was demonstrated in the United States in 1941  Although their early work with Whittle s designs was later handed to Allison Engine Company  GE Aviation emerged as one of the world s largest engine manufacturers  second only to the well founded and older British company  Rolls Royce plc  which led the way in the design and manufacture of innovative  reliable  efficient  high performance  heavy duty jet engines  In 2002  GE acquired the windpower assets of Enron during its bankruptcy proceedings  12 Enron Wind was the only surviving U S  manufacturer of large wind turbines at the time  and GE increased engineering and supplies for the Wind Division and doubled the annual sales to  1 2 billion in 2003  13

GE 4020  and GE 4060 real time process control computers  the Datanet 30 and Datanet 355 message switching computers  Datanet 30 and 355 were also used as front end processors for GE mainframe computers   A Datanet 500 computer was designed  but never sold  In 1962  GE started developing its GECOS  later renamed GCOS  operating system  originally for batch processing  but later extended to timesharing and transaction processing  Versions of GCOS are still in use today  In 1964 1969  GE and Bell Laboratories  which soon dropped out  joined with MIT to develop the pioneering and influential Multics operating system on the GE 645 mainframe computer  The project took longer than expected and was not a major commercial success  but it demonstrated important concepts such as single level store  dynamic linking  hierarchical file system  and ring oriented security  Active development of Multics continued until 1985  It has been said by whom   that GE got into computer manufacturing because in the 1950s they were the largest user of computers outside of the United States federal government  However  in 1970  GE sold its computer division to Honeywell  exiting the computer manufacturing industry  though it retained its timesharing operations for some years afterwards  GE was a major provider of computer timesharing services  through General Electric Information Services  GEIS  now GXS   offering online computing services that included GEnie   edit  Acquisitions This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by

Public Campaign criticized General Electric for spending  84 35 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008 2010  instead getting  4 7 billion in tax rebates  despite making a profit of

history of some of its activities giving rise to large scale air and water pollution  Based on year 2000 data  43  researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute listed the corporation as the fourth largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States  with more than 4 4 million pounds per year  2 000 tons  of toxic chemicals released into the air  44  GE has also been implicated in the creation of toxic waste  According to EPA documents  only the United States Government  Honeywell  and Chevron Corporation are responsible for producing more Superfund toxic waste sites  45  In 1983  New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York to compel GE to pay for the cleanup of what was claimed to be more than 100 000 tons of chemicals dumped  legally  at the time  from their plant in Waterford  New York  46  In 1999  the company agreed to pay a  250 million settlement in connection with claims it polluted the Housatonic River  Pittsfield  Massachusetts  and other sites with polychlorinated biphenyls  PCBs  and other hazardous substances  47  From approximately 1947 to 1977  GE discharged as much as 1 3 million pounds of PCBs from its capacitor manufacturing plants at the Hudson Falls and Fort Edward upstate New York facilities into the Hudson River  48  GE fought a media and political battle to avoid cleaning up the river and countered that dredging the river would actually stir up PCBs  49  In 2002  GE was ordered to clean up a 40 mile  64 km  stretch of the Hudson River it had contaminated  50  In 2003  acting on concerns that the plan proposed by GE did not  provide for adequate protection of public health and the environment   the United States Environmental

emission aircraft engines  lighter and stronger durable materials  efficient lighting  and water purification technology   57  The announcement prompted an op ed piece in The New York Times to observe that   while General Electric s increased emphasis on clean technology will probably result in improved products and benefit its bottom line  Mr  Immelt s credibility as a spokesman on national environmental policy is fatally flawed because of his company s intransigence in cleaning up its own toxic legacy   58  GE has said that it will invest  1 4 billion in clean technology research and development in 2008 as part of its Ecomagination initiative  As of October 2008  the scheme had resulted in 70 green products being brought to market  ranging from halogen lamps to biogas engines  In
