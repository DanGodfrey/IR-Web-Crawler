Cooperative From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia    Redirected from Soci t  coop rative  Jump to  navigation  search This article is about the type of organization known as a  cooperative   For other uses  see Coop  disambiguation   A cooperative  also co operative or co op  is an autonomous association of persons who voluntarily cooperate for their mutual social  economic  and cultural benefit  1  Cooperatives include non profit community organizations and businesses that are owned and managed by the people who use its services  a consumer cooperative  and or by the people who work there  a worker cooperative   Various aspects regarding cooperative enterprise are the focus of study in the field of cooperative economics  The Cloyne Court Hotel  a student housing cooperative in Berkeley

Tribes were organized as cooperative structures  allocating jobs and resources among each other  only trading with the external communities  In alpine environments  trade could only be maintained in organized cooperatives to achieve a useful condition of artificial roads such as Viamala in 1473  2  Pre industrial Europe is home to the first cooperatives from an industrial context  citation needed  Robert Owen  1771   1858  was a social reformer and a pioneer of the cooperative movement  In 1761  the Fenwick Weavers  Society was formed in Fenwick  East Ayrshire  Scotland to sell discounted oatmeal to local workers  3  Its services expanded to include assistance with savings and loans  emigration and education  In 1810  Welsh social reformer Robert Owen  from Newtown in mid Wales  and his partners purchased New Lanark mill from Owen s father in law David Dale and proceeded to introduce better labour standards including discounted retail shops where profits were passed on to his employees  Owen left New Lanark to pursue other forms of cooperative organization and develop co op ideas through writing and lecture  Cooperative communities were set up in Glasgow  Indiana and Hampshire  although ultimately unsuccessful  In 1828  William King set up a newspaper  The Cooperator  to promote Owen s thinking  having already set up a co operative store in Brighton  citation needed  The Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers  founded in 1844  is usually considered the first successful cooperative enterprise  used as a model for modern co ops  following the  Rochdale Principles   A group of 28 weavers and other artisans in Rochdale  England set up the society to open their own store selling food items they could not otherwise afford  Within ten years there were over 1 000 cooperative societies in the United Kingdom  citation needed  Other events such as the founding of a friendly society by the Tolpuddle Martyrs in 1832 were key occasions in the creation of organized labor and consumer movements  citation needed   edit  Social economy In the final year of the 20th century  cooperatives banded together to establish a number of social enterprise agencies which have moved to adopt the multi stakeholder cooperative model  4  5  In the last 15 years  1994 2009  the EU and its member nations  have gradually revised national accounting systems to  make visible  the increasing contribution of social economy organizations  6   edit  Organizational and ideological roots The roots of the cooperative movement can be traced to multiple influences and extend worldwide  In the Anglosphere  post feudal forms of cooperation between workers and owners  that are expressed today as  profit sharing  and  surplus sharing  arrangements  existed as far back as 1795  7  The key ideological influence on the Anglosphere branch of the cooperative movement  however  was a rejection of the charity principles that underpinned welfare reforms when the British government radically revised its Poor Laws in 1834  As both state and church institutions began to routinely distinguish between the  deserving  and  undeserving  poor  a movement of friendly societies grew throughout the British Empire based on the principle of mutuality  committed to self help in the welfare of working people  citation needed  Friendly Societies established forums through which one member  one vote was practiced in organisation decision making  The principles challenged the idea that a person should be an owner of property before being granted a political voice  4  Throughout the second half of the nineteenth century  and then repeatedly every 20 years or so  there has been a surge in the number of cooperative organisations  both in commercial practice and civil society  operating to advance democracy and universal suffrage as a political principle  8  Friendly Societies and consumer cooperatives became the dominant form of organization amongst working people in Anglosphere industrial societies prior to the rise of trade unions and industrial factories  Weinbren reports that by the end of the 19th century  over 80  of British working age men and 90  of Australian working age men were members of one or more Friendly Society  9  From the mid nineteenth century  mutual organisations embraced these ideas in economic enterprises  firstly amongst tradespeople  and later in cooperative stores  educational institutes  financial institutions and industrial enterprises  The common thread  enacted in different ways  and subject to the constraints of various systems of national law  is the principle that an enterprise or association should be owned and controlled by the people it serves  and share any surpluses on the basis of each members  cooperative contribution  as a producer  labourer or consumer  rather than their capacity to invest financial capital  10  The cooperative movement has been fueled globally by ideas of economic democracy  Economic democracy is a socioeconomic philosophy that suggests an expansion of decision making power from a small minority of corporate shareholders to a larger majority of public stakeholders  There are many different approaches to thinking about and building economic democracy  Both Marxism and anarchism  for example  have been influenced by utopian socialism  which was based on voluntary cooperation  without recognition of class conflict  Anarchists are committed to libertarian socialism and they have focused on local organization  including locally managed cooperatives  linked through confederations of unions  cooperatives and communities  Marxists  who as socialists have likewise held and worked for the goal of democratizing productive and reproductive relationships  often placed a greater strategic emphasis on confronting the larger scales of human organization  As they viewed the capitalist class to be politically  militarily and culturally mobilized for the purpose of maintaining an exploitable working class  they fought in the early 20th century to appropriate from the capitalist class the society s collective political capacity in the form of the state  either through democratic socialism  or through what came to be known as Leninism  Though they regard the state as an unnecessarily oppressive institution  Marxists considered appropriating national and international scale capitalist institutions and resources  such as the state  to be an important first pillar in creating conditions favorable to solidaristic economies  11  12  With the declining influence of the USSR after the 1960s  socialist strategies pluralized  though economic democratizers have not as yet established a fundamental challenge to the hegemony of global neoliberal capitalism   edit  Meaning  edit  Cooperatives as legal entities A cooperative is a legal entity owned and democratically controlled by its members  Members often have a close association with the enterprise as producers or consumers of its products or services  or as its employees  citation needed  In some countries  e g  Finland and Sweden  there are specific forms of incorporation for cooperatives  Cooperatives may take the form of companies limited by shares or by guarantee  partnerships or unincorporated associations  In the USA  cooperatives are often organized as non capital stock corporations under state specific cooperative laws  However  they may also be unincorporated associations or business corporations such as limited liability companies or partnerships  such forms are useful when the members want to allow citation needed   some members to have a greater share of the control  or some investors to have a return on their capital that exceeds fixed interest  neither of which may be allowed under local laws for cooperatives  Cooperatives often share their earnings with the membership as dividends  which are divided among the members according to their participation in the enterprise  such as patronage  instead of according to the value of their capital shareholdings  as is done by a joint stock company    edit  Identity Cooperatives are based on the cooperative values of  self help  self responsibility  democracy and equality  equity and solidarity  and the seven cooperative principles  13  Voluntary and Open Membership Democratic Member Control Member Economic Participation Autonomy and Independence Education  Training and Information Cooperation among Cooperatives Concern for Community Cooperatives are dedicated to the values of openness  social responsibility and caring for others  Such legal entities have a range of social characteristics  Membership is open  meaning that anyone who satisfies certain non discriminatory conditions may join  Economic benefits are distributed proportionally to each member s level of participation in the cooperative  for instance by a dividend on sales or purchases  rather than according to capital invested  13  Cooperatives may be classified as either worker  consumer  producer  purchasing or housing cooperatives  14  They are distinguished from other forms of incorporation in that profit making or economic stability are balanced by the interests of the community  13  Co ops can sometimes be identified on the Internet through the use of the  coop gTLD  Organizations using  coop domain names must adhere to the basic co op values  The United Nations has declared 2012 to be the International Year of Cooperatives  IYC   15   edit  Types of cooperative governance  edit  Retailers  cooperative Main article  Retailers  cooperative A retailers  cooperative  known as a secondary or marketing cooperative in some countries  is an organization which employs economies of scale on behalf of its members to receive discounts from manufacturers and to pool marketing  It is common for locally owned grocery stores  hardware stores and pharmacies  In this case the members of the cooperative are businesses rather than individuals  16  The Best Western international hotel chain is actually a retailers  cooperative  whose members are hotel operators  although it refers to itself as a  nonprofit membership association   It gave up on the  cooperative  label after some courts insisted on enforcing regulatory requirements for franchisors despite its member controlled status  citation needed   edit  Worker cooperative Main article  Worker cooperative A worker cooperative or producer cooperative is a cooperative  that is owned and democratically controlled by its  worker owners   There are no outside owners in a  pure  workers  cooperative  only the workers own shares of the business  though hybrid forms exist in which consumers  community members or capitalist investors also own some shares  In practice  control by worker owners may be exercised through individual  collective or majority ownership by the workforce  or the retention of individual  collective or majority voting rights  exercised on a one member one vote basis   17  A worker cooperative  therefore  has the characteristic that the majority of its workforce owns shares  and the majority of shares are owned by the workforce  18  Membership is not always compulsory for employees  but generally only employees can become members either directly  as shareholders  or indirectly through membership of a trust that owns the company  citation needed  The impact of political ideology on practice constrains the development of cooperatives in different countries  In India  there is a form of workers  cooperative which insists on compulsory membership for all employees and compulsory employment for all members  That is the form of the Indian Coffee Houses  This system was advocated by the Indian communist leader A  K  Gopalan  In places like the UK  common ownership  indivisible collective ownership  was popular in the 1970s  Cooperative Societies only became legal in Britain after the passing of Slaney s Act in 1852  In 1865 there were 651 registered societies with a total membership of well over 200 000  19  There are now more than 400 worker cooperatives in the UK  20  Suma Wholefoods being the largest example with a turnover of  24 million  citation needed  Spanish law permits owner members to register as self employed enabling worker owners to establish regulatory regimes that support cooperative working  but which differs considerably from cooperatives that are subject to Anglo American systems of law that require the cooperative  employer  to view  and treat  its worker members as salaried workers  employees   21  The implications of this are far reaching  as this requires cooperatives to establish authority driven statutory disciplinary and grievance procedures  rather than democratic mediation schemes   impacting on the ability of leaders to enact democratic forms of management and counter the authority structures embedded in the dominant system of private enterprise centred around the entrepreneur  22   edit  Volunteer cooperative A volunteer cooperative is a cooperative that is run by and for a network of volunteers  for the benefit of a defined membership or the general public  to achieve some goal  Depending on the structure  it may be a collective or mutual organization  which is operated according to the principles of cooperative governance  The most basic form of volunteer run cooperative is a voluntary association  A lodge or social club may be organized on this basis  A volunteer run co op is distinguished from a worker cooperative in that the latter is by definition employee owned  whereas the volunteer cooperative is typically a non stock corporation  volunteer run consumer co op or service organization  in which workers and beneficiaries jointly participate in management decisions and receive discounts on the basis of sweat equity  citation needed   edit  Social cooperative Main article  Social cooperative A particularly successful form of multi stakeholder cooperative is the Italian  social cooperative   of which some 7 000 exist   Type A  social cooperatives bring together providers and beneficiaries of a social service as members   Type B  social cooperatives bring together permanent workers and previously unemployed people who wish to integrate into the labour market  They are legally defined as follows  23  no more than 80  of profits may be distributed  interest is limited to the bond rate and dissolution is altruistic  assets may not be distributed  the cooperative has legal personality and limited liability the objective is the general benefit of the community and the social integration of citizens those of type B integrate disadvantaged people into the labour market  The categories of disadvantage they target may include physical and mental disability  drug and alcohol addiction  developmental disorders and problems with the law  They do not include other factors of disadvantage such as unemployment  race  sexual orientation or abuse  type A cooperatives provide health  social or educational services various categories of stakeholder may become members  including paid employees  beneficiaries  volunteers  up to 50  of members   financial investors and public institutions  In type B cooperatives at least 30  of the members must be from the disadvantaged target groups voting is one person one vote A good estimate of the current size of the social cooperative sector in Italy is given by updating the official Istituto Nazionale di Statistica  Istat  figures from the end of 2001 by an annual growth rate of 10   assumed by the Direzione Generale per gli Ente Cooperativi   This gives totals of 7 100 social cooperatives  with 267 000 members  223 000 paid employees  31 000 volunteers and 24 000 disadvantaged people undergoing integration  Combined turnover is around 5 billion euro  The cooperatives break into three types  59  type A  social and health services   33  type B  work integration  and 8  mixed  The average size is 30 workers  citation needed  The volunteer board of a retail consumers  cooperative  such as the former Oxford  Swindon  amp  Gloucester Co op  is held to account at an Annual General Meeting of members  edit  Consumers  cooperative Main article  Consumers  cooperative A consumers  cooperative is a business owned by its customers  Employees can also generally become members  Members vote on major decisions and elect the board of directors from amongst their own number  The first of these was set up in 1844 in the North West of England by 28 weavers who wanted to sell food at a lower price than the local shops  A well known example in the United States is the REI  Recreational Equipment Incorporated  co op  and in Canada  Mountain Equipment Co op  citation needed  With its 414 383 employees  7 736 210 members and a turnover of  50Bn per year growing at a steady rate of 4 41   24 Legacoop 25  of Italy is arguably the world s biggest federation of cooperatives  citation needed  The world s largest consumers  cooperative is the Co operative Group in the United Kingdom  which offers a variety of retail and financial services  The UK also has a number of autonomous consumers  cooperative societies  such as the East of England Co operative Society and Midcounties Co operative  In fact  the Co operative Group is something of a hybrid  having both corporate members  mostly other consumers  cooperatives  as a result of its origins as a wholesale society   and individual retail consumer members  citation needed  Japan has a very large and well developed consumer cooperative movement with over 14 million members  retail co ops alone had a combined turnover of 2 519 trillion Yen  21 184 billion US dollars  market exchange rates as of 15 November 2005   in 2003 4  26  Migros is the largest supermarket chain in Switzerland and has around 2 million of the country s 7 2 million population as members  citation needed  Switzerland s second biggest supermarket chain  Coop is also a cooperative  In 2001  it merged with 11 cooperative federations which had been its main suppliers for over 100 years  citation needed  As of 2005  Coop operates 1 437 shops and employs almost 45 000 people  According to Bio Suisse  the Swiss organic producers  association  Coop accounts for half of all the organic food sold in Switzerland  citation needed  Euro Coop is the European Community of Consumer Cooperatives   edit  Business and employment cooperative Main article  Business and employment co operative Business and employment cooperatives  BECs  are a subset of worker cooperatives that represent a new approach to providing support to the creation of new businesses  citation needed  Like other business creation support schemes  BECs enable budding entrepreneurs to experiment with their business idea while benefiting from a secure income  The innovation BECs introduce is that once the business is established the entrepreneur is not forced to leave and set up independently  but can stay and become a full member of the cooperative  The micro enterprises then combine to form one multi activity enterprise whose members provide a mutually supportive environment for each other  citation needed  BECs thus provide budding business people with an easy transition from inactivity to self employment  but in a collective framework  They open up new horizons for people who have ambition but who lack the skills or confidence needed to set off entirely on their own   or who simply want to carry on an independent economic activity but within a supportive group context  citation needed   edit  New generation cooperative New generation cooperatives  NGCs  are an adaptation of traditional cooperative structures to modern  capital intensive industries  They are sometimes described as a hybrid between traditional co ops and limited liability companies  They were first developed in California and spread and flourished in the US Mid West in the 1990s  27  They are now common in Canada where they operate primarily in agriculture and food services  where their primary purpose is to add value to primary products  For example producing ethanol from corn  pasta from durum wheat  or gourmet cheese from goat s milk  28   edit  Types of cooperatives  edit  Housing cooperative Co op City in New York is the largest cooperative housing development in the world with 55 000 people  29  Main article  Housing cooperative A housing cooperative is a legal mechanism for ownership of housing where residents either own shares  share capital co op  reflecting their equity in the cooperative s real estate  or have membership and occupancy rights in a not for profit cooperative  non share capital co op   and they underwrite their housing through paying subscriptions or rent  citation needed  Housing cooperatives come in three basic equity structures citation needed   In Market rate housing cooperatives  members may sell their shares in the cooperative whenever they like for whatever price the market will bear  much like any other residential property  Market rate co ops are very common in New York City  Limited equity housing cooperatives  which are often used by affordable housing developers  allow members to own some equity in their home  but limit the sale price of their membership share to that which they paid  Group equity or Zero equity housing cooperatives do not allow members to own equity in their residences and often have rental agreements well below market rates  Main article  Building cooperative Members of a building cooperative  in Britain known as a self build housing cooperative  pool resources to build housing  normally using a high proportion of their own labour  When the building is finished  each member is the sole owner of a homestead  and the cooperative may be dissolved  citation needed  This collective effort was at the origin of many of Britain s building societies  which however developed into  permanent  mutual savings and loan organisations  a term which persisted in some of their names  such as the former Leeds Permanent   Nowadays such self building may be financed using a step by step mortgage which is released in stages as the building is completed  citation needed  The term may also refer to worker cooperatives in the building trade  citation needed   edit  Utility cooperative Main article  Utility cooperative A utility cooperative is a type of consumers  cooperative that is tasked with the delivery of a public utility such as electricity  water or telecommunications services to its members  Profits are either reinvested into infrastructure or distributed to members in the form of  patronage  or  capital credits   which are essentially dividends paid on a member s investment into the cooperative  In the United States  many cooperatives were formed to provide rural electrical and telephone service as part of the New Deal  See Rural Utilities Service  citation needed  In the case of electricity  cooperatives are generally either generation and transmission  G amp T  co ops that create and send power via the transmission grid or local distribution co ops that gather electricity from a variety of sources and send it along to homes and businesses  30  In Tanzania  it has been proven that the cooperative method is helpful in water distribution  When the people are involved with their own water  they care more because the quality of their work has a direct effect on the quality of their water  31   edit  Agricultural cooperative Grain elevators are used by agricultural cooperatives in the storage and shipping of grains  Main article  Agricultural cooperative Agricultural cooperatives or farmers  cooperatives are cooperatives where farmers pool their resources for mutual economic benefit  Agricultural cooperatives are broadly divided into agricultural service cooperatives  which provide various services to their individual farming members  and agricultural production cooperatives  where production resources such as land or machinery are pooled and members farm jointly  32  Agricultural production cooperatives are relatively rare in the world  and known examples are limited to collective farms in former socialist countries and the kibbutzim in Israel  citation needed  Agricultural supply cooperatives aggregate purchases  storage  and distribution of farm inputs for their members  By taking advantage of volume discounts and utilizing other economies of scale  supply cooperatives bring down members  costs  Supply cooperatives may provide seeds  fertilizers  chemicals  fuel  and farm machinery  Some supply cooperatives also operate machinery pools that provide mechanical field services  e g   plowing  harvesting  to their members  citation needed  Agricultural marketing cooperatives provide the services involved in moving a product from the point of production to the point of consumption  Agricultural marketing includes a series of inter connected activities involving planning production  growing and harvesting  grading  packing  transport  storage  food processing  distribution and sale  Agricultural marketing cooperatives are often formed to promote specific commodities  citation needed   edit  Credit unions and cooperative banking Main articles  Cooperative banking and Credit union The Co operative Bank s head office in Manchester  The statue in front is of Robert Owen  a pioneer in the cooperative movement  Credit unions are cooperative financial institutions that are owned and controlled by their members  Credit unions provide the same financial services as banks but are considered not for profit organizations and adhere to cooperative principles  Credit unions originated in mid 19th century Germany through the efforts of pioneers Franz Hermann Schulze Delitzsch and Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen  The concept of financial cooperatives crossed the Atlantic at the turn of the 20th century  when the caisse populaire movement was started by Alphonse Desjardins in Quebec  Canada  In 1900  from his home in L vis  he opened North America s first credit union  marking the beginning of the Mouvement Desjardins  33  Eight years later  Desjardins provided guidance for the first credit union in the United States  34  where there are now about 7 950 active status federally insured credit unions  with almost 90 million members and more than  679 billion on deposit  35  While they have not taken root so deeply as in Ireland  credit unions are also established in the UK  The largest are work based  but many are now offering services in the wider community  The Association of British Credit Unions Ltd  ABCUL  represents the majority of British Credit Unions  British Building Societies developed into general purpose savings  amp  banking institutions with  one member  one vote  ownership and can be seen as a form of financial cooperative  although nine  de mutualised  into conventionally owned banks in the 1980s  amp  1990s   The UK Co operative Group includes both an insurance provider CIS and the Co operative Bank  both noted for promoting ethical investment  Other important European banking cooperatives include the Cr dit Agricole in France  Migros and Coop Bank in Switzerland and the Raiffeisen system in many Central and Eastern European countries  The Netherlands  Spain  Italy and various European countries also have strong cooperative banks  They play an important part in mortgage credit and professional  i e  farming  credit  citation needed  Cooperative banking networks  which were nationalized in Eastern Europe  work now as real cooperative institutions  A remarkable development has taken place in Poland  where the SKOK  Sp ldzielcze Kasy Oszczednosciowo Kredytowe  network has grown to serve over 1 million members via 13 000 branches  and is larger than the country s largest conventional bank  citation needed  In Scandinavia  there is a clear distinction between mutual savings banks  Sparbank  and true credit unions  Andelsbank   citation needed  The oldest cooperative banks in Europe  based on the ideas of Friedrich Raiffeisen  are joined together in the  Urgenossen    edit  Federal or secondary cooperatives Main article  Cooperative Federation In some cases  cooperative societies find it advantageous to form cooperative federations in which all of the members are themselves cooperatives  Historically  these have predominantly come in the form of cooperative wholesale societies  and cooperative unions  36  Cooperative federations are a means through which cooperative societies can fulfill the sixth Rochdale Principle  cooperation among cooperatives  with the ICA noting that  Cooperatives serve their members most effectively and strengthen the cooperative movement by working together through local  national  regional and international structures   37  See also  List of Co operative Federations  edit  Cooperative wholesale society Main article  Cooperative wholesale society According to cooperative economist Charles Gide  the aim of a cooperative wholesale society is to arrange  bulk purchases  and  if possible  organise production   36  The best historical example of this were the English CWS and the Scottish CWS  which were the forerunners to the modern Co operative Group  citation needed   edit  Cooperative Union Main article  Cooperative union A second common form of cooperative federation is a cooperative union  whose objective  according to Gide  is  to develop the spirit of solidarity among societies and    in a word  to exercise the functions of a government whose authority  it is needless to say  is purely moral   36 Co operatives UK and the International Cooperative Alliance are examples of such arrangements  citation needed   edit  Cooperative party In some countries with a strong cooperative sector  such as the UK  cooperatives may find it advantageous to form a parliamentary political party to represent their interests  The British Cooperative Party and the Canadian Cooperative Commonwealth Federation are prime examples of such arrangements  citation needed  The British cooperative movement formed the Cooperative Party in the early 20th century to represent members of consumers  cooperatives in Parliament  The Cooperative Party now has a permanent electoral pact with the Labour Party  and has 29 members of parliament who were elected at the 2005 general election as Labour Cooperative MPs  UK cooperatives retain a significant market share in food retail  insurance  banking  funeral services  and the travel industry in many parts of
