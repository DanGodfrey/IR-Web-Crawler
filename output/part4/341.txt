1988  as Venom  The character has since appeared in many Marvel Comics publications including his own series Venom  Introduced as the first incarnation of the Spider Man villain Venom  the character

artist Todd McFarlane are generally credited with the character s creation  based on a number of plot ideas and concepts from various other creators  though the degree to which McFarlane should be credited with co creating the character has been a source of dispute in the comic book industry  citation needed  The question of who created the character of Venom became an issue of contention in 1993 when Michelinie wrote to the comic book industry magazine Wizard  which had referred to Michelinie in issue  17 as  co creator  of Venom  In his letter  printed in issue  21  May 1993   Michelinie wrote that he was the character s sole creator  while saying also he believed that without McFarlane the character would not have attained the popularity it did  6  First full cover appearance of Venom as depicted by co creator Todd McFarlane  Writer Peter David corroborated Michelinie s view in his  But I Digress  column in the June 4  1993 Comics Buyer s Guide  in which he stated that Michelinie discussed the ideas behind the character with him at the time of its creation  At that time  David was the writer on The Spectacular Spider Man and wrote the  Sin Eater  storyline from which Eddie Brock s backstory would be derived  well before McFarlane was assigned to the art duties on Amazing  Because artists who design the costumes or appearances of major characters and or illustrate their first appearances are generally credited as co creators  Venom represents a complex situation  because the costume from which Venom s appearance is derived was not designed by McFarlane  7  Erik Larsen responded to Michelinie s letter with one of his own that was printed in Wizard  23  July 1993   in which he dismissed Michelinie s contributions to the character  arguing that Michelinie merely  swiped  the preexisting symbiote and its powers to place it on a character whose motivations were poorly conceived  one dimensional  unbelievable  and clich d  Larsen also argued that it was McFarlane s rendition of the character that made it commercial  8  Erik Larsen  who followed Todd McFarlane as artist on Amazing Spider Man  added the long tongue and drool to Venom s appearance  The preexisting elements that dealt with the symbiote costume itself   to which Michelinie did not contribute   have also been noted  For example  editor Jim Shooter came up with the idea of switching Spider Man to a black and white costume  possibly influenced by the intended costume design for the new Spider Woman  with artists Mike Zeck and Rick Leonardi  as well as others  designing the black and white costume 7   though a 2007 Comic Book Resources story contends that a fan suggested a black costume for the Spider Man prior to this  for which he was paid by Shooter  9   Writer artist John Byrne asserts on his website that the idea for a costume made of self healing biological material was one he originated when he was the artist on Iron Fist to explain how that character s costume was constantly being torn and then apparently repaired by the next issue  explaining that he ended up not using the idea on that title  but that Roger Stern later asked him if he could use the idea for Spider Man s alien costume  Stern in turn plotted the issue in which the costume first appeared but then left the title  It was writer Tom DeFalco and artist Ron Frenz who had established that the costume was a sentient alien being and also that it was vulnerable to high sonic energy during their run on The Amazing Spider Man that preceded Michelinie s  10  Regardless  Peter David s position is that Michelinie is the sole creator  since the idea of creating a separate character using the alien symbiote was Michelinie s  as was Eddie Brock s backstory  and that without the idea to create such a character  the character would not have existed  7  In an interview with Tom DeFalco  11  McFarlane claims that Michelinie did indeed come up with the idea of Venom and the character s basic design   a big guy in the black costume    However  he contends that it was he  McFarlane  who gave Venom his monster like features  He claims   I just wanted to make him kooky and creepy  and not just some guy in a black suit   This dispute arose at a time when artists such as McFarlane and Larsen were enjoying a great deal of popularity and clout with readers  and capitalizing on their popularity by publishing creator owned books with their new company  Image Comics  and it is possible that this issue was a subtext of the greater debate over the importance of writers versus artists that was being waged in the industry at the time  Prior to McFarlane s departure from Marvel  the company stated that Venom was a creation of McFarlane s  and Michelinie shared credit as co creator  citation needed  Regardless of the issues surrounding his creation  Venom was created under a work for hire contract  and Marvel owns all rights to the character  Venom s existence was first indicated in Web of Spider Man  18  Sept  1986   when he shoved Peter Parker in front of a subway train without Parker s spider sense warning him  though only Brock s hand was seen on panel  The next indication of Venom s existence was in Web of Spider Man  24  March 1987   when Parker had climbed out of a high story window to change into Spider Man  but found a black arm coming through the window and grabbing him  again without being warned by his spider sense  The character would remain unseen and inactive until Amazing Spider Man editor Jim Salicrup required a villain for that book s 300th issue  and Michelinie suggested a villain consisting of the alien symbiote grafted onto the body of a human female  Salicrup accepted the suggestion  but changed the character to a male  Michelinie then devised the Eddie Brock identity  Michelinie contends that the plots for issues  298 299  as well as the visual descriptions of the character  were written and bought by Salicrup before McFarlane was ever assigned to the book   edit  Fictional character biography See also  List of Venom titles  edit  Backstory Left  Brock bonding with the symbiote  Right  Brock s first

Man  the Symbiote s former host  including superhuman strength  speed  agility and reflexes as well as the ability to adhere to most surfaces with his hands and feet  14  The Symbiote is also able to project a web like substance from its body  similar to Spider Man s  14  However  this webbing is produced organically by the Symbiote from its own mass meaning overuse can weaken the alien until it is able to regenerate  14  The Symbiote can also send out tendrils which can be used to grab or manipulate items from a distance  23  When bonded with the host  the Symbiote allows the host to bypass Spider Man s spider sense  preventing him sensing attacks  14  The Symbiote is susceptible to harm from high pitched sonic frequencies which can cause it to be severely weakened or killed  The bond

natural physical strength from weight training  his strength as Venom is significantly superior to Spider Man s  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  As Anti Venom Anti Venom is created when the healing energies of Martin Li cause Brock s white blood cells and traces of the Venom Symbiote still within his body to combine into a new suit composed of human alien hybrid antibodies possessing powerful restorative abilities  79  81  Brock is capable of rapidly healing significant injury as Anti Venom  recovering almost instantly after being shot in the head and suffering damage to his brain  85  91  However  this healing ability can be negated by the energy of Mr  Negative  counteracting the energy of Martin Li  85  Anti Venom is able to detect when others are ill 92  and  cure  or  cleanse  them

to the weaknesses of the Venom Symbiote  showing no damage or effect from direct blasts of fire  heat and sound  91  93  The only shown weaknesses of the Symbiote are a highly toxic  super venom  created as a direct countermeasure using remnants of Anti Venom s suit  and Mr  Negative s energy  81  The  super venom  causes the suit to immediately dissolve  82  Mr  Negative is shown capable of using his energy to weaken or nullify the healing abilities of the suit  85   edit  Other versions Main article  Alternative versions of Venom The character appears in several alternate universe
