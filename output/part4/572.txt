federal government  created in response to the September 11 attacks  and with the primary responsibilities of protecting the United States of America and U S  Territories  including Protectorates  vague  from and responding to terrorist attacks  man made accidents  and natural disasters  In fiscal year 2011 it was allocated a budget of  98 8 billion and spent  net   66 4 billion  Whereas the Department of Defense is charged with military actions abroad  the Department of Homeland Security works in the civilian sphere to protect the United States within  at  and outside its borders  Its stated goal is to prepare for  prevent  and respond to domestic emergencies  particularly terrorism  5  On March 1  2003  DHS absorbed the Immigration and Naturalization Service and assumed its duties  In doing so  it divided the enforcement and services functions into two separate and new agencies  Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services  The investigative divisions and intelligence gathering units of the INS and Customs Service were merged forming Homeland Security Investigations  Additionally  the border enforcement functions of the INS  including the U S  Border Patrol  the U S  Customs Service  and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service were consolidated into a new agency under DHS  U S  Customs and Border Protection  The Federal Protective Service falls under the National Protection and Programs Directorate  With more than 200 000 employees  DHS is the third largest Cabinet department  after the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs  6 Homeland security policy is coordinated at the White House by the Homeland Security Council  Other agencies with significant homeland security responsibilities include the Departments of Health and Human Services  Justice  and Energy  According to the Homeland Security Research Corporation  the combined financial year 2010 state and local HLS markets  which employ more than 2 2 million first responders  totaled  16 5 billion  whereas the DHS HLS market totaled  13 billion  7  According to the Washington Post   DHS has given  31 billion in grants since 2003 to state and local governments for homeland security and to improve their ability to find and protect against terrorists  including  3 8 billion in 2010   8  According to Peter Andreas  a border theorist  the creation of DHS constituted the most significant government reorganization since the Cold War  9  and the most substantial reorganization of federal agencies since the National Security Act of 1947  which placed the different military departments under a secretary of defense and created the National Security Council and Central Intelligence Agency  DHS also constitutes the most diverse merger of federal functions and responsibilities  incorporating 22 government agencies into a single organization  10  Contents 1 Structure 2 Nomenclature 3 Expenditures 3 1 Audit of expenditures 4 Homeland

to the U S  as  the nation  or  the republic   and to its internal policies as  domestic   14  Also unprecedented was the use  from 2002  of the phrase  the homeland  by White House spokespeople  14  The choice of this phrase raised questions regarding the self image of the USA  15   edit  Expenditures In the United States Federal Budget for 2010  entitled  A New Era of Responsibility   the DHS was allocated a discretionary budget of  42 7 billion  financial year 2009   40 1 billion   16  The end of year DHS Annual Financial Report for financial year 2010 showed a net cost of operations of

26   edit  Homeland Security Advisory System The Homeland Security Advisory System scale On March 12  2002  the Homeland Security Advisory System  a color coded terrorism risk advisory scale  was created as the result of a Presidential Directive to provide a  comprehensive and effective means to disseminate information regarding the risk of terrorist acts to Federal  State  and local authorities and to the American people   Many procedures at government facilities are tied in to the alert level  for example a facility may search all entering vehicles when the alert is above a certain level  Since January 2003  it has been administered in coordination with DHS  it has also been the target of frequent jokes and ridicule on the part of the administration s detractors about its ineffectiveness  After resigning  Tom Ridge stated that he did not always agree with the threat level adjustments pushed by other government agencies  27  In January 2003  the office clarification needed  was merged into the Department of Homeland Security and the White House Homeland Security Council  both of which were created by the Homeland Security Act of 2002  The Homeland Security Council  similar in nature to the National Security Council  retains a policy coordination and advisory role and is led by the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security  28  As of January 13  2011 the DHS advised the American public of an  elevated national threat  level  recommending that all Americans  should establish an emergency preparedness kit and emergency plan for themselves and their family  and stay informed about what to do during an emergency   29   edit  Creation Seal of the Office of Homeland Security  the predecessor to DHS In response to the September 11 attacks  President George W  Bush announced the establishment of the Office of Homeland Security  OHS  to coordinate  homeland security  efforts  The office was headed by former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge  who assumed the title of Assistant to the President for Homeland Security  The official announcement stated    The mission of the Office will be to develop and coordinate the implementation of a comprehensive national strategy to secure the United States from terrorist threats or attacks  The Office will coordinate the executive branch s efforts to detect  prepare for  prevent  protect against  respond to  and recover from terrorist attacks within the United States  28    Ridge began his duties as OHS director on October 8  2001  The Department of Homeland Security was established on November 25  2002  by the Homeland Security Act of 2002  It was intended to consolidate U S  executive branch organizations related to  homeland security  into a single Cabinet agency  The following 22 agencies were incorporated into the new department  30  A U S  Customs and Border Protection Officer addresses Dick Cheney  center   then Vice President of the United States  Saxby

controversy about its adoption centered on whether the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency should be incorporated in part or in whole  neither were included   The bill itself was also controversial for the presence of unrelated  riders   as well as for eliminating certain union friendly civil service and labor protections for department employees  Without these protections  employees could be expeditiously reassigned or dismissed on grounds of security  incompetence or insubordination  and DHS would not be required to notify their union representatives  The plan stripped 180 000 government employees of their union rights  31  In 2002  Bush officials argued that the September 11 attacks made the proposed elimination of employee protections imperative  32  Congress ultimately passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002 without the union friendly measures  and President Bush signed the bill into law on November 25  2002  It was the largest U S  government reorganization in the 50 years since the United States Department of Defense was created  Tom Ridge was named secretary on January 24  2003 and began naming his chief deputies  DHS officially began operations on January 24  2003  but most of the department s component agencies were not transferred into the new Department until March 1  28  President George W  Bush signs the Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2004 on October 1  2003  After establishing the basic structure of DHS and working to integrate its components and get the department functioning  Ridge announced his resignation on November 30  2004  following the re election of President Bush  Bush initially nominated former New York City Police Department commissioner Bernard Kerik as his successor  but on December 10  Kerik withdrew his nomination  citing personal reasons and saying it  would not be in the best interests  of the country for him to pursue the post  On January 11  2005  President Bush nominated federal judge Michael Chertoff to succeed Ridge  Chertoff was confirmed on February 15  2005  by a vote of 98 0 in the U S  Senate  He was sworn in the same day  28  In February 2005  DHS and the Office of Personnel Management issued rules relating to employee pay and discipline for a new personnel system named MaxHR  The Washington Post said that the rules would allow DHS  to override any provision in a union contract by issuing a department wide directive  and would make it  difficult  if not impossible  for unions to negotiate over arrangements for staffing  deployments  technology and other workplace matters   32  In August 2005  U S  District Judge Rosemary M  Collyer blocked the plan on the grounds that it did not ensure collective bargaining rights for DHS employees  32  A federal appeals court ruled against DHS in 2006  pending a final resolution to the litigation  Congress s fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for DHS provided no funding for the proposed new personnel system  32  DHS announced in early 2007 that it was retooling its pay and performance system and retiring the name  MaxHR   28  In a February 2008 court filing  DHS said that it would no longer pursue the new rules  and that it would abide by the existing civil service labor management procedures  A federal court issued an order closing the case  32   edit  Seal Seal of the Department of Homeland Security  A DHS press release dated June 6  2003 33  explains the seal as follows  The seal is symbolic of the Department s mission   to prevent attacks and protect Americans   on the land  in the sea and in the air  In the center of the seal  a graphically styled white American eagle appears in a circular blue field  The eagle s outstretched wings break through an inner red ring into an outer white ring that contains the words  U S  DEPARTMENT OF  in the top half and  HOMELAND SECURITY  in the bottom half in a circular placement  The eagle s wings break through the inner circle into the outer ring to suggest that the Department of Homeland Security will break through traditional bureaucracy and perform government functions differently  In the tradition of the Great Seal of the United States  the eagle s talon on the left holds an olive branch with 13 leaves and 13 seeds while the eagle s talon on the right grasps 13 arrows  Centered on the eagle s breast is a shield divided into three sections containing elements that represent the American homeland   air  land  and sea  The top element  a dark blue sky  contains 22 stars representing the original 22 entities that have come together to form the department  The left shield element contains white mountains behind a green plain underneath a light blue sky  The right shield element contains four wave shapes representing the oceans alternating light and dark blue separated by white lines  The seal was developed with input from senior DHS leadership  employees  and the U S  Commission on Fine Arts  The Ad Council   which partners with DHS on its Ready gov campaign   and the consulting company Landor Associates were responsible for graphic design and maintaining heraldic integrity   edit  Headquarters Since its inception  the department has had its temporary headquarters in Washington  D C  s Nebraska Avenue Complex  a former naval facility  The 38 acre  15 ha  site  across from American University  has 32 buildings comprising 566 000 square feet  52 600 m2  of administrative space  34  In early 2007  the Department submitted a  4 1 billion plan to Congress to consolidate its 60 plus Washington area offices into a single headquarters complex at the St  Elizabeths Hospital campus in Anacostia  Southeast Washington  D C  The earliest DHS would begin moving to St  Elizabeths is 2012  35  The move is being championed by District of Columbia officials because of the positive economic impact it will have on historically depressed Anacostia  The move has been criticized by historic preservationists  who claim the revitalization plans will destroy dozens of historic buildings on the campus  36  Community activists have criticized the plans because the facility will remain walled off and have little interaction with the surrounding area  37  On January 8  2009  the National Capital Planning Commission approved the Department of Homeland Security s plans to move into the campus of St  Elizabeths Hospital  38   edit  Ready gov Ready gov program logo Soon after the formation of Department of Homeland Security  the Martin Agency of Richmond  Virginia worked pro bono to create  Ready gov   a readiness website  The site and materials were conceived in March 2002 and launched in February 2003  just before the launch of the Iraq War  39  40  41  One of the first announcements that garnered widespread public attention to this campaign was one by Tom Ridge in which he stated that in the case of a chemical attack  citizens should use duct tape and plastic sheeting to build a homemade bunker  or  sheltering in place  to protect themselves  42  43  As a result  the sales of duct tape skyrocketed and DHS was criticized for being too alarmist  44  The site was promoted with banner ads containing automatic audio components on commercial web sites   edit  National Incident Management System On March 1  2004  the National Incident Management System  NIMS  was created  The stated purpose was to provide a consistent incident management approach for federal  state  local  and tribal governments  Under Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5  all federal departments were required to adopt the NIMS and to use it in their individual domestic incident management and emergency prevention  preparedness  response  recovery  and mitigation program and activities   edit  National Response Framework In December 2004  the National Response Plan  NRP  was created  in an attempt to align federal coordination structures  capabilities  and resources into a unified  all discipline  and all hazards approach to domestic incident management  The NRP was built on the template of the NIMS  On January 22  2008  the National Response Framework was published in the Federal Register as an updated replacement of the NRP  effective March 22  2008   edit  Cyber security See also  Cyber security regulation The DHS National Cyber Security Division  NCSD  is responsible for the response system  risk management program  and requirements for cyber security in the U S  The division is home to US CERT operations and the National Cyber Alert System  45  46  The DHS Science and Technology Directorate helps government and private end users transition to new cyber security capabilities  This directorate also funds the Cyber Security Research and Development Center  which identifies and prioritizes research and development for NCSD  46  The center works on the Internet s routing infrastructure  the SPRI program  and Domain Name System  DNSSEC   identity theft and other online criminal activity  ITTC   Internet traffic and networks research  PREDICT datasets and the DETER testbed   Department of Defense and HSARPA exercises  Livewire and Determined Promise   and wireless security in cooperation with Canada  47  On October 30  2009  DHS opened the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center  The center brings together government organizations responsible for protecting computer networks and networked infrastructure  48   edit  Criticism See also  Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina  edit  Excess  waste  and ineffectiveness The Department of Homeland Security has been dogged by persistent criticism over excessive bureaucracy  waste  ineffectiveness and lack of transparency  Congress estimates that the department has wasted roughly  15 billion in failed contracts  as of September 2008 update    49  In 2003  the department came under fire after the media revealed that Laura Callahan  Deputy Chief Information Officer at DHS with responsibilities for sensitive national security databases  had obtained her advanced computer science degrees through a diploma mill in a small town in Wyoming  The department was blamed for up to  2 billion of waste and fraud after audits by the Government Accountability Office revealed widespread misuse of government credit cards by DHS employees  with purchases including beer brewing kits   70 000 of plastic dog booties that were later deemed unusable  boats purchased at double the retail price  many of which later could not be found   and iPods ostensibly for use in  data storage   50  51  52  53   edit  Data mining  ADVISE  The Associated Press reported on September 5  2007  that DHS had scrapped an anti terrorism data mining tool called ADVISE  Analysis  Dissemination  Visualization  Insight and Semantic Enhancement  after the agency s internal Inspector General found that pilot testing of the system had been performed using data on real people without required privacy safeguards in place  54  55  The system  in development at Lawrence Livermore and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory since 2003  has cost the agency  42 million to date  Controversy over the program is not new  in March 2007  the Government Accountability Office stated that  the ADVISE tool could misidentify or erroneously associate an individual with undesirable activity such as fraud  crime or terrorism   Homeland Security s Inspector General later said that ADVISE was poorly planned  time consuming for analysts to use  and lacked adequate justifications  56   edit  Fusion centers Main article  Fusion center Fusion centers are terrorism prevention and response centers  many of which were created under a joint project between the Department of Homeland Security and the US Department of Justice s Office of Justice Programs between 2003 and 2007  The fusion centers gather information not only from government sources  but also from their partners in the private sector  57  58  They are designed to promote information sharing at the federal level between agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency  CIA   Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI   Department of Justice  US Military and state and local level government  As of July 2009 update   the Department of Homeland Security recognized at least seventy two fusion centers  59  Fusion centers may also be affiliated with an Emergency Operations Center that responds in the event of a disaster  There are a number of documented criticisms of fusion centers  including relative ineffectiveness at counterterrorism activities  the potential to be used for secondary purposes unrelated to counterterrorism  and their links to violations of civil liberties of American citizens and others  60  David Rittgers of the Cato Institute has noted a long line of fusion center and DHS reports labeling broad swaths of the public as a threat to national security  The North Texas Fusion System labeled Muslim lobbyists as a potential threat  a DHS analyst in Wisconsin thought both pro  and anti abortion activists were worrisome  a Pennsylvania homeland security contractor watched environmental activists  Tea Party groups  and a Second Amendment rally  the Maryland State Police put anti death penalty and anti war activists in a federal terrorism database  a fusion center in Missouri thought that all third party voters and Ron Paul supporters were a threat      61   edit  MIAC report The Missouri Information Analysis Center  MIAC  made news in 2009 for targeting vague  supporters of third party candidates  such as Ron Paul   pro life activists  and conspiracy theorists as potential militia members  62 Anti war activists and Islamic lobby groups were targeted in Texas  drawing criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union  63  According to the Department of Homeland Security  64  The Privacy Office has identified a number of risks to privacy presented by the fusion center program  Justification for fusion centers Ambiguous Lines of Authority  Rules  and Oversight Participation of the Military and the Private Sector Data Mining Excessive Secrecy Inaccurate or Incomplete Information Mission Creep  edit  2009 Virginia terrorism threat assessment In early April 2009  the Virginia Fusion Center came under criticism for publishing a terrorism threat assessment which stated that certain universities are potential hubs for terror related activity  65  The report targeted historically black colleges and identified hacktivism as a form of terrorism  66   edit  Mail interception In 2006  MSNBC reported that Grant Goodman   an 81 year old retired University of Kansas history professor  received a letter from his friend in the Philippines that had been opened and resealed with a strip of dark green tape bearing the words  by Border Protection  and carrying the official Homeland Security seal   67  The letter was sent by a devout Catholic Filipino woman with no history of supporting Islamic terrorism  67  A spokesman for U S  Customs and Border Protection  acknowledged that the agency can  will and does open mail coming to U S  citizens that originates from a foreign country whenever it s deemed necessary    All mail originating outside the United States Customs territory that is to be delivered inside the U S  Customs territory is subject to Customs examination   says the CBP Web site  That includes personal correspondence   All mail means  all mail    said John Mohan  a CBP spokesman  emphasizing the point  67  The Department declined to outline what criteria are used to determine when a piece of personal correspondence should be opened or to say how often or in what volume Customs might be opening mail  67  Goodman s story provoked outrage in the blogosphere  68  as well as in the more established media  Reacting to the incident  Mother Jones remarked that   u nlike other prying government agencies  Homeland Security wants you to know it is watching you   69 CNN observed that   o n the heels of the NSA wiretapping controversy  Goodman s letter raises more concern over the balance between privacy and security   70   edit  Employee morale In July 2006  the Office of Personnel Management conducted a survey of federal employees in all 36 federal agencies on job satisfaction and how they felt their respective agency was headed  DHS was last or near to last in every category including  33rd on the talent management index 35th on the leadership and knowledge management index 36th on the job satisfaction index 36th on the results oriented performance culture index The low scores were attributed to major concerns about basic supervision  management and leadership within the agency  Examples from the survey reveal most concerns are about promotion and pay increase based on merit  dealing with poor performance  rewarding creativity and innovation  leadership generating high levels of motivation in the workforce  recognition for doing a good job  lack of satisfaction with various component policies and procedures and lack of information about what is going on with the organization  71  72   edit  Inside the DHS Starting in the fourth quarter of 2011  the department s inner workings will be featured on the AMC reality television program Inside the DHS  Secretary
