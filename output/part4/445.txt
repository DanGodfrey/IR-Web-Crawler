Masters of the Universe Publication information First appearance 1982 1  Created by Mattel In story information Base s  Eternia Masters of the Universe  commonly abbreviated MOTU and sometimes referred to as He Man  after the lead hero  is a media franchise created by Mattel  2  3  4  Although featuring a vast line up of characters  the main premise revolves around the conflict between the heroic He Man and the evil Skeletor on planet Eternia  Since its initial launch late 1981  the franchise has spawned a variety of products  including six lines of action figures  four animated television series  several comic series  and a feature film  Designer Roger Sweet claims to be the chief creator of He Man and MOTU  5  although this is not officially acknowledged by Mattel  and disputed by some other contributors  The earliest storybooks and much of the original backstory were written by Donald F  Glut  6  Contents 1 History 1 1 Origin of the franchise 2 Versions of the

Mattel s CEO Ray Wagner declined a request to produce a toyline of action figures based on the characters from the George Lucas film Star Wars  7  8  note 1  Upon the commercial success of the film trilogy during the next few years and all related merchandise  Mattel attempted to launch several unsuccessful toylines  none of which captured the public s imagination or made a significant dent in the toy market  7  note 2  In the race to design the next hit action figure  Roger Sweet  a lead designer working for Mattel s Preliminary Design Department throughout much of the 1970s and 1980s  realized simplicity was the key to success  7  8  According to his book Mastering the Universe  He Man and the Rise and Fall of a Billion Dollar Idea published in 2005  Sweet knew that if he gave marketing something they could sell  he d won 90  of the battle  7  9  note 3   The only way I was going to have a chance to sell this  to Wagner  was to make three 3D models   big ones  I glued a Big Jim figure  from another Mattel toy line  into a battle action pose and I added a lot of clay to his body  I then had plaster casts made  These three prototypes  which I presented in late 1980  brought He Man into existence    I simply explained that this was a powerful figure that could be taken anywhere and dropped into any context because he had a generic name  He Man   note 4  7   Roger Sweet 8  It has been rumored that Conan the Barbarian was a source of inspiration for the He Man character  According to this rumor  Mattel had a licensing agreement to make the Conan action figures associated with the 1982 film of the same name starring Arnold Schwarzenegger  Apparently  such idea had to be modified in order to avoid objections from parents concerning that a toyline for kids was promoting a film with nudity and violence  In addition  brown haired prototype versions of the He Man action figure with a strong resemblance to the Conan character created by Robert E  Howard were produced and given away as promotion through an unknown mail in order by mistake  10  This rumor has been refuted by Roger Sweet claiming that he conceptualized and developed the He Man Masters of the Universe franchise in late 1980  two years prior to the release of the Universal Pictures film  The toyline existed prior to the movie  starting production in 1981 and marketed in 1982  At that time  Mattel did not have a license with Universal to make toys for the film  which resulted in Conan Properties suing Mattel over copyright infringement with He Man s similarities to Conan  10  From the lawsuit of CPI vs  Mattel   In 1980  CPI  through its agent  Conan Licensing Company   CLC    began negotiations with Mattel regarding the possible licensing to Mattel of certain toy rights in Conan  During this time  Mattel received a substantial quantity of material on the Conan character  On July 31  1981  CPI and Mattel executed a License Agreement whereby Mattel was granted  the right to make and sell certain plastic action figures of Conan and ancillary characters as depicted in the Conan movie   Amended Complaint  para  12  The Agreement provided  however   that nothing in the License should be construed as an assignment or grant to Mattel of any right  title or interest in or to Conan  and that all rights relating thereto were reserved by CPI  except only for the licensee to use the property as specifically agreed to    Amended Complaint  para  14  It was also agreed that  after the termination of the License Agreement  Mattel would not make or sell any Conan toys    In January 1982  Mattel requested that the License Agreement be terminated  On April 14  1982  CPI and Mattel entered into a termination agreement which provided that  all materials created and or developed by Mattel for use in connection with products under the Conan License  would be delivered to CPI s agent  CPC  which would have  the exclusive right to use such material   Amended Complaint  para  17    In February 1982  Mattel introduced a fantasy character   He Man   as part of its new  Masters of the Universe  toy line of action figures  Since that time  Mattel has also featured He Man and the other Masters of the Universe characters in  inter alia  a television series  comic books  and video tapes  Thereafter  CPI commenced this action asserting that these figures are copies of Conan  were created under the License  and are CPI s property  Amended Complaint  paras  20  21   In the end  Mattel won the lawsuit against Conan Properties to retain the rights over He Man and the Masters of the Universe  10  Originally  He Man was presented in drawings and wax sculptures to the Mattel executives as a barbarian  a soldier  and a spaceman  Out of the three concepts  the barbarian version was chosen to be the basis of the toyline  Taking in consideration that the Conan character was created almost 50 years prior to the development of the He Man franchise  it is likely that the Masters of the Universe borrowed many aspects from Conan  but it appears that it was not intended to be a toyline for the film after legal agreements were dissolved  10  Additionally  Roger Sweet has claimed also to have been  real impressed  by the paintings of fantasy artist Frank Frazetta when creating He Man  8  To further expand on this initial barbarian theme  Mattel hired comic book writers and artists such as Donald F  Glut and Earl Norem to create additional characters and their backstory  posters  package inlays  box art and mini comics to be distributed with the action figures  The very first prototype He Man was black haired with a deeply tanned eastern European or Middle Eastern appearance  His helmet had no horns  Later  at the direction of Tom Kalinske  then in Mattel s upper management  He Man was made more clean cut and changed to a blond    Plus  He Man s skin was lightened  though definitely still tanned   Roger Sweet 7  8   edit  Versions of the franchise As with many toy franchises which have been transferred to several different media there are a number of story differences between the various versions of Masters of the Universe  Complicating matters further  several media have made implicit attempts to change details to realign with other versions  with the result that internal discontinuities arise   edit  The original minicomics  1981 1983  All of the original action figures came with minicomics that told stories involving the characters  In the earliest comics  He Man is a wandering barbarian on Eternia  a world dealing with the aftermath of a Great War that has devastated the civilizations that once reigned  but has left behind fantastical machinery and weapons  The events of the Great War opened a rift between dimensions  which allows the evil warlord Skeletor to travel to Eternia  and he has now set his sights on the ancient Castle Grayskull  the  fortress of mystery and power   Whoever attains control of Grayskull will gain the power to become Master of the Universe  To prevent Skeletor from achieving his goal  He Man has been given special powers and weapons by The Sorceress  referred to as  The Goddess  in early stories  except in her debut appearance in which she is shown  the one and only time  to have green skin  and sets out to defend the castle from Skeletor  He Man is supported by several heroic allies  such as Man At Arms  the Eternian master of weapons  and Teela  the adopted daughter of Man At Arms  Skeletor manages to find one half of the Power Sword  a great weapon which is itself the key to Castle Grayskull  He Man has been given the other half by The Sorceress  and must prevent Skeletor from linking the two halves to gain access to the castle  11   edit  Cartoon series  1983 1985  Main article  He Man and the Masters of the Universe The animated series He Man and the Masters of the Universe was produced by Filmation and made its television debut in 1983  12  Eternia is ruled by King Randor and Queen Marlena   The latter was born Marlena Glen  a Terran astronaut who married Randor after she was marooned on Eternia by the crash of her spaceship   Their son is Prince Adam  who pretends he is lazy  clumsy  careless  irresponsible and almost as cowardly as his pet tiger Cringer   Adam s twin sister  Princess Adora  was kidnapped at birth by the evil warlord Hordak   who raised her as his own daughter to become a captain in his army   However  Prince Adam possesses a magic sword  and when he holds it aloft and says the magic words   By the power of Grayskull   I have the Power     Prince Adam is transformed into He Man   The Most Powerful Man In The Universe   2  Despite the limited animation techniques that were used to produce the series  He Man and the Masters of the Universe was notable for breaking the boundaries of censorship that had severely restricted the narrative scope of children s TV programming in the 1970s  For the first time in years  a cartoon series could feature a muscular superhero who was actually allowed to hit people  although most of the time wrestling style moves were utilized instead of direct violence   though he still couldn t use his sword often  The cartoon was controversial in that it was produced in connection with marketing a line of toys  advertising to children was itself controversial during this period  In Britain  advertising regulations forbade commercials for He Man toys to accompany the program itself  either before or after the episode  as there were no in show commercials   Similar to other shows at the time  notably G I  Joe   an attempt to mitigate the negative publicity generated by this controversy was made by including a  life lesson  or  moral of the story  at the end of each episode  This moral was usually tied to the action or central theme of the episode  In the United Kingdom  where the episodes were usually edited for timing reasons  these closing  morals  were nearly always edited out of their original broadcasts  13  14  15  The cartoon series was also remarkable because it was one of the first animated series produced directly for syndication  as opposed to most other syndicated cartoons of the time which were re runs of old Saturday morning cartoons  The most notable production fact of the series was that it was the very first animated series where a bulk quantity of 65 episodes were produced so that the series could be stripped across 13 weeks  12  It is also noted for featuring early script writing work from Babylon 5 creator J  Michael Straczynski  and Paul Dini of Batman  The Animated Series fame 16  One episode   Battle Cat   was written by Star Trek s D C  Fontana   edit  She Ra  Princess of Power  1985  Main article  She Ra  Princess of Power In 1985  Mattel and Filmation decided to diversify the Masters of the Universe line beyond its traditional realm of  male action  in the hopes of bringing in a young female audience as well  12  Thus  Mattel created a new line Princess of Power and invented She Ra as its feminine warrior woman heroine  The toyline featured almost exclusively female characters  all of whom featured an emphasis on hair and clothing  with  real  hair and partially softgoods costumes  Essentially  the line attempted to fuse the appeal of Masters of the Universe with Mattel s most long standing success  Barbie  Filmation then had the task of revealing that Prince Adam had a twin sister  Princess Adora  who was first introduced in the animated feature The Secret of the Sword  This film was a compilation of the first five episodes of the new television series  She Ra  Princess of Power  which ran for 93 episodes from 1985 to 1986  and was produced in lieu of continuing He Man and the Masters of the Universe for a third year  He Man often appeared in special crossover episodes of She Ra to aid his sister  and many other characters from He Man and the Masters of the Universe  both heroic and evil  also had crossover episodes  Just as Prince Adam transforms into He Man with the use of his Sword of Power  Adora transforms into She Ra via her Sword of Protection  a replica of He Man s sword featuring a smooth white gem in its hilt  Adora s transformation into She Ra is similarly triggered by holding her sword over her head  and by uttering her own unique invocation   For the honor of Grayskull    I AM SHE RA   Unlike He Man s sword  however  She Ra s possesses the ability to transform into different weapons and accessories  such as a lasso  a shield or a flaming blade  when commanded by She Ra  She Ra lives on the world of Etheria  which is dominated by the Evil Horde  and she fights to free her planet from its tyrannical ruler Hordak  Hordak and the Evil Horde were originally created in the MOTU toyline as a second evil force who were after both He Man and Skeletor  and debuted in Mattel s minicomics as such  However  given that the He Man series had been ceased to allow Filmation to concentrate on She Ra  Filmation decided to reassign Hordak and the Evil Horde as the main villains of the She Ra series to give the characters exposure  The character of Catra  the only villain in the first wave of She Ra toys  was therefore made a member of the Horde  Thus  the premise of the She Ra series was the reverse of the He Man cartoon  whereby the heroes are actually rebels countering an evil establishment  17   edit  The Powers of Grayskull The distant past of Eternia  dubbed  Preternia   18  forms the basis of the next incarnation of the toyline  entitled The Powers of Grayskull  However the toyline was axed very early on  with only a few toys released  The main story information originates from the final mini comic The Powers of Grayskull   The Legend Begins   which was intended as the first of a three parter  however only this issue appeared  The information provided in the mini comics is supported by snippets of information on some of the toy packaging  Ancient Eternia was populated by many creatures  including cybernetic dinosaurs and giants  When the Sorceress and He Man arrive  followed by Skeletor  they find King Hiss leading an attack on a village in the hope of drawing out  The Elders   using some of the cybernetic dinosaurs to their advantage  Hiss serves an  unnamed one  and agrees to unite with Skeletor on the basis that he might be an emissary  Seeing Skeletor s interference  the Sorceress allows He Man to enter the battle but   for reasons that will be made clear to you in the future   he had to be disguised  He finds himself overwhelmed  but then a shadowy figure appears who turns the odds with a powerful wand  The stranger then sends the Snake Men back to their base and all the time travellers home  The Sorceress describes the intervener as  the Greatest Sorcerer of all  and He Man is left asking   But who is he   No further story information is given  and it remains unclear how the giants mentioned and released as toys would fit into the story  However  some marketing press releases and prototypes have shed further information  The wizard was He Ro  an ancestor of He Man  Raised by his mentor Eldor and discovering special powers in a cave  He Ro would have led the fight against the Snake Men  According to the mini comics  writers it was intended that the central antagonist would be Keldor  a character revealed similarly late in the line to have been He Man s uncle and also strongly hinted to have been the former identity of Skeletor  Whether or not Keldor was also supposed to be the  Unnamed One  Hiss served is not clear  although in an interview writer Steven Grant vaguely recalls that the intention was that the Unnamed One would be a greater evil who  as the Emperor was to Darth Vader  was intended to be the one who caused Keldor to become Skeletor  19   edit  Live action movie  1987  Main article  Masters of the Universe  film  In 1987  a live action He Man film was made by Cannon Films entitled Masters of the Universe  The release date in the USA was August 7  1987  The film starred Dolph Lundgren in the title role of He Man  Frank Langella as Skeletor  with Courteney Cox and Robert Duncan McNeill in supporting roles  The other characters from the original cartoon to appear in the film are Evil Lyn  Meg Foster   Man At Arms  Jon Cypher   Teela  Chelsea Field   Beast Man  Tony Carroll   and the Sorceress  Christina Pickles   The character Gwildor  Billy Barty  is included  apparently in place of Orko  because the special effects of the time would have been insufficient and too costly to create him  Many viewers reviewed the motion picture in comparison to the cartoon  when it really was an adaptation of the toys only  which initially depicted He Man as a barbarian in the first mini comics  no Prince Adam or Orko   Ed Pressman was interested in the property before the cartoon was even aired and Filmation had no involvement whatsoever in the film  In the movie  Skeletor has finally conquered Eternia after stealing the Cosmic Key from the locksmith Gwildor  which allows him to gain entry to Castle Grayskull  He imprisons The Sorceress within an energy draining field and her powers are being transferred to him  In an attempt to rescue The Sorceress  the heroes He Man  Man At Arms  Teela and Gwildor are accidentally transported to Earth by the Cosmic Key  Stranded on Earth  they are faced with the task of recovering the Cosmic Key and getting back to Eternia before Skeletor can gain the power of Grayskull  but Skeletor sends his minions to Earth with the mission of beating them to the Cosmic Key  and chaos ensues as the war between good and evil is transferred to Earth  Numerous parts of the previously accepted history of the series are omitted in the film  including all references to Prince Adam  as well as Randor and Marlena  in fact it is implied that Castle Grayskull itself is the ruling point of Eternia rather than any royal city  The story concentrates more on the science fiction elements of the franchise rather than the fantasy  Aside from The Sorceress and Skeletor there is little reference to magic powers  with most of the characters relying instead on futuristic technology  He Man himself uses a gun in some scenes in addition to his Power Sword  and he only displays superhuman strength in one scene  when toppling a huge statue  Although He Man twice utters his catchphrase  I Have the Power  while holding the sword aloft in the iconic manner  he does omit the prefacing clause  By the Power of Grayskull   Although Mattel had hoped that the movie would boost sales of the toyline  it instead had no effect on the line s falling sales  and the MOTU toy line was finally discontinued in early 1988 under immense financial difficulties  A sequel to the film was written  but by 1989  Cannon Films was in such severe financial troubles that it could no longer afford to pay the license fees to Mattel  Thus the script was transformed into the action film Cyborg  starring Jean Claude Van Damme  citation needed   edit  New Movie Grayskull  Masters of the Universe was an announced science fiction fantasy film based on the toy line  According to Variety  it is produced by Joel Silver  and written by Justin Marks  and employing visual special effects to a large degree  as was done with the 2007 war film 300  20  Warner announced that John Stevenson  director of Kung Fu Panda will direct the upcoming feature  On 12 May 2009 it was announced that the scripting duties had been handed to newcomer Evan Daugherty  with John Stevenson still attached to direct  21  In September 2009  Sony took over the rights from Warner Bros to produce the Masters of the Universe live action film after Mattel and Silver couldn t agree on creative direction for the film  22  Sony and Escape Artists  Todd Black  Jason Blumenthal and Steve Tisch will now start developing the project from scratch for Columbia Pictures  In April 2010  Sony hired screenwriters Mike Finch and Alex Litvak to draft a new script  23   edit  The New Adventures of He Man  1990  The New Adventures animated series  Main article  The New Adventures of He Man In 1989  two years after the financially disastrous ending of the original Masters of the Universe product line  a second He Man animated series titled The New Adventures of He Man  was produced by DiC to promote Mattel s short lived attempt to revive the MOTU brand with a new toyline  simply titled He Man  The new series is radically different to the original fantasy oriented milieu  shifting to an almost purely science fiction setting which sees He Man transported to the futuristic planet of Primus ruled by Master Sebrian  As He Man leads the Galactic Guardians  Skeletor bases himself on the evil world of Denebria  where he forms an alliance with Flogg and the Mutants  who are hellbent on conquering Primus for themselves  The series contains clear continuity links to the original Masters of the Universe  and was intended as a continuation of the existing mythology  although some fans see it as a separate canon from the original series due to the differences in style and character portrayal  Other than He Man and Skeletor  The Sorceress of Castle Grayskull is the only character from the original series to make regular appearances  acting as a guide to He Man  Several other characters are featured in the pilot episode  including King Randor and Queen Marlena  who learn of the dual identity of Prince Adam and He Man  24  25  The majority of the cartoon episodes were written by Jack Olesker  resulting in a tight continuity  which was almost entirely lacking in the earlier Filmation series  Neither the New Adventures animated series or toyline were nearly as popular as the originals  lasting only sixty five episodes and a few poorly received waves of action figures  25  26   edit  He Man and the Masters of the Universe 2002 relaunch  edit  Toyline In 2002  Mattel launched a new Masters of the Universe toyline with sculpts designed by the Four Horsemen  The new toyline was made surprisingly faithful to the original line  with the characters gently  re imagined  and updated in terms of sculpting detail rather than radically reinterpreted  27  One point of contention for many fans of the original Masters toyline was the redesign of He Man s Power Sword  According to the Four Horsemen  this was due to their original re sculpts being intended for a continuation of the original storyline in which Skeletor had obtained both halves of the Power Sword  hence the new Skeletor figure s dual blades with clear  good  and  evil  hilt designs   necessitating a new sword to be built by Man At Arms and endowed with the properties of the original by the Sorceress  citation needed  However  Mattel decided to reboot the continuity for a new generation of children  and thus the  new  Power Sword design became the  original  version for the new continuity  28  The line s faithfulness to the original series made it very popular with collectors  however  suggesting it would have been better served as a collector based line  akin to DC Direct  This theory was borne out in the wake of the discontinuation of the mass market toyline  with NECA taking the rather unprecedented step of continuing the toyline through action figure sized mini statues scaled and sculpted to be aesthetically compatible for display alongside the Mattel toys  thus allowing fans to fill out their collections with other Four Horsemen redesigned characters that had yet to be produced as figures when the toyline was canceled  According to a December 8  2005 interview with a Mattel representative on he man org  NECA offered to produce fully articulated action figures for Mattel without taking any credit  but permission was denied  Instead  NECA was only permitted to produce nonarticulated statues  29   edit  Cartoon series Main article  He Man and the Masters of the Universe  2002 TV series  A new animated series was produced to accompany the toyline  made by Mike Young Productions and lasting for 39 episodes  This series involved much tighter continuity and a somewhat greater depth of characterization than its Filmation predecessor  30  Later episodes of this series were retitled Masters of the Universe vs  the Snake Men  and sidelined Skeletor as chief villain in favor of King Hiss  leader of the reptilian Snake Men  Hordak and The Evil Horde were to be the main antagonist for the third season if the show had continued  31   edit  Masters of the Universe Classics A line of toys that were debuted in 2008  Sculpted by the Four Horsemen  these toys are updated versions of previous figures as well as figures of characters that have never before had a toy  As of February 2010  the figures of He Man and Skeletor are available as Toys R Us exclusives packed in two packs with Superman and Lex Luthor respectively  from Mattel s DC Universe Classics action figure line  Both lines are designed by the Four Horsemen  This dual line has since been expanded to include two packs featuring Aquaman and Mer Man  and Hawkman and Stratos  with more expected  Dark Horse Comics will be producing mini comics to be included in Mattel s Masters of the Universe Classics line of toys  continuing the series of mini comics first introduced in the original He Man toys of the 1980s  The mini comics will be written by Tim Seeley and drawn by Wellinton Alves  with covers by Eric Powell  According to Seeley  the current mini comics will finish off the story that was supposed to be the new direction of the original action figure line  before it was cancelled  The story will deal with the The Powers of Grayskull line  which included King Hsss  Tyrantisaurus Rex and He Ro  tying the toy continuity to the He Man line  also known as  Preternia He Man   Seeley also states that the current Mattel line intends to blend the different He Man continuities and select the best stories and ideas from MOTU history  32   edit  Mattel MOTU action figures  accessories  amp

and removed   March 2012  The action figures themselves were often repaints and head swaps of existing characters  outfitted with different equipment  for example  Stinkor was originally a color swap of Mer Man wearing a re colored version of Mekaneck s breastplate  For much of the original line  there were limited molds  Two chests  hairy and smooth  one belt pair of shorts  and three sets of arms and legs  smooth muscular  evil  claw  fingers toes  and hairy   Teela had her own mold  which was later duplicated for Evil Lyn  When the second wave appeared  several new molds were used  Ram Man  Man E Faces  and Trap Jaw all had new mold pieces   Wave three incorporated the same torso for Whiplash and Buzz Off  New legs were shared with Whiplash  Buzz Off and early released of Clawful  Wave Four saw the introduction of more unique body parts  i e  Leech  Mantenna and Sy Klone  with Moss Man and Hordak being the only character to use entirely old body parts  Wave 5 was entirely new body parts for all but one character  Tung Lashor  whilst the final wave returned to the  classic  look  Each action figure featured 5 points of articulation  possible head  arms and legs   removable armour  a weapon accessory and a spin loaded  Power punch   All 8 characters featured the spring loaded twisting waist  but it was Wave 2 that saw additional action features unique to the character such as Tri Klops s rotatable visor and Ram Man s spring loaded legs  Each figure would also come packaged with a mini comic  The line debuted in 1982 with just four figures to begin with  He Man  Man At Arms  Skeletor and Beast Man  Later that year the remaining four characters from Wave 1 were released  They were Stratos  Teela  Mer Man and Zodac  Each figure came with removable armour  a weapon and mini comic  Mekaneck was the first character from Wave 3 to appear in shelves at the tail end of 1983  The rock warriors  Stonedar and Rokkon arrived in the UK a full year before the rest of their wave 5 counterparts  This may have been due to their appearance in the UK Masters of the Universe fortnightly magazine in 1986  Originally Beast Man was meant to be He Man arch rival  Stratos was an evil warrior and Mer Man and Tri Klops were both intended to be heroic warriors  This changed by the time of their release  Teela  He Man riding Battlecat  Zodak in the Slime Pit  Skeletor riding
