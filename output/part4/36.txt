Lantern  etc   during the late 1950s  DC Comics asked writer Gardner Fox to reintroduce the Justice Society of America  Fox  influenced by the popularity of the National Football League and Major League Baseball  decided to change the name of the team from Justice Society to Justice League  1  The Justice League of America debuted in The Brave and the Bold  28  1960   and after two further appearances in that title  got their own series which quickly became one of the company s best selling titles  Fox and artist Mike Sekowsky were the creative team for the title s first eight years  Sekowsky s last issue was  63  June 1968  and Fox departed with  65  September 1968   The initial Justice League lineup included seven of the DC superheroes being published regularly at that time  Superman  Batman  Aquaman  Flash  Green Lantern  Martian Manhunter  and Wonder Woman  However  Superman and Batman barely featured in most of the stories  not even appearing on the cover most of the time  Three of DC s other surviving or revived characters  Green Arrow  Atom  and Hawkman  were added to the roster over the next four years  the latter two having been revamped by Gardner Fox himself  JLA s early success was indirectly responsible for the creation of the Fantastic Four  In his autobiography Stan Lee relates how  during a round of golf  DC publisher Jack Liebowitz mentioned to Marvel Timely owner Martin Goodman how well DC s new book  Justice League  was selling  Later that day Goodman told Lee to come up with a team of superheroes for Marvel  Lee and Jack Kirby produced the Fantastic Four  2  3  The Justice League operated from a secret cave outside of the small town of Happy Harbor  Rhode Island  A teenager named Lucas  Snapper  Carr tagged along on missions  and he became both the team s mascot and an official member  Snapper  noted for speaking in beatnik dialect and snapping his fingers  helped the League to defeat giant space starfish Starro the Conqueror in the team s first appearance  In Justice League of America  77  December 1969   Snapper was tricked into betraying the cave headquarters  secret location to the Joker  resulting in his resignation from the team  His resignation followed the resignations of two of the League s original members  Wonder Woman  in Justice League of America  69  and J onn J onzz  in Justice League of America  71   4   edit  Satellite years Main article  Justice League Satellite In need of a new secure headquarters  the Justice League moved into an orbiting satellite headquarters in Justice League of America  78  February 1970   Black Canary  Phantom Stranger  Elongated Man  Red Tornado  Hawkwoman  Zatanna and Firestorm all joined the team during this period  and Wonder Woman returned  In the first two thirds or so of this era  the team was sometimes said to have a twelve member limit and or a  no duplication of powers  policy  this was formally rescinded in Justice League of America  146  allowing Hawkgirl to join  Those involved in producing the Justice League of America comic during the 1970s include writers Denny O Neil  Mike Friedrich  Len Wein  Elliot S  Maggin  Cary Bates  E  Nelson Bridwell  Steve Englehart and Gerry Conway  with Dick Dillin handling the art chores from issues  64 181  missing only one issue   153 and did only a framing sequence for  157  Len Wein wrote issues  100 114 wherein he and Dillin re introduced the Seven Soldiers of Victory in issues  100 102 5  and the Freedom Fighters in issues  107 108  6  In the fall of 1972  Wein and writers Gerry Conway and Steve Englehart crafted a metafictional unofficial crossover spanning titles from both major comics companies  Each comic featured Englehart  Conway  and Wein  as well as Wein s first wife Glynis  interacting with Marvel or DC characters at the Rutland Halloween Parade in Rutland  Vermont  Beginning in Amazing Adventures  16  by Englehart with art by Bob Brown and Frank McLaughlin   the story continued in Justice League of America  103  by Wein  Dillin and Dick Giordano   and concluded in Thor  207  by Conway and penciler John Buscema   As Englehart explained in 2010   It certainly seemed like a radical concept and we knew that we had to be subtle  laughs  and each story had to stand on its own  but we really worked it out  It s really worthwhile to read those stories back to back to back   it didn t matter to us that one was at DC and two were at Marvel   I think it was us being creative  thinking what would be really cool to do   7  8  9 Libra  a supervillain created by Wein and Dillin in Justice League of America  111  May June 1974   10  would play a leading role in Grant Morrison s Final Crisis storyline in 2008  Writer Gerry Conway had a lengthy association with the title as well  His first JLA story appeared in issue  125  December 1975  and he became the series  regular writer with issue  151  February 1978   With a few exceptions  Conway would write the team s adventures until issue  255  October 1986   11  After Dick Dillin s death  George P rez  Don Heck  and Rich Buckler would rotate as artist on the title  The double sized anniversary issue  200  March 1982  was a  jam  featuring a story written by Conway  a framing sequence drawn by P rez  and chapters drawn by Pat Broderick  Jim Aparo  Dick Giordano  Gil Kane  Carmine Infantino  Brian Bolland  and Joe Kubert  Bolland s chapter gave the artist his  first stab at drawing Batman   12  P rez would leave the title as of issue  200 13  to concentrate on The New Teen Titans although he would contribute covers to the JLA through issue  220  November 1983    edit  Detroit Seeking to capitalize on the popularity of their other team books  which focused upon heroes in their late teens early 20s  Gerry Conway and artist Chuck Patton revamped the Justice League series  After most of the original heroes failed to arrive in order to help the team fend off an invasion of Martians  Aquaman dissolved the League and reformatted its charter to only allow heroes who would devote their full time to the roster  14  The new team initially consisted of Aquaman  Zatanna  Martian Manhunter  Elongated Man  the Vixen  and a trio of teenage heroes Gypsy  Steel  and Vibe  15  Aquaman would leave the team after a year and was replaced as leader by the Martian Manhunter  Because of his own edict of only wanting full time heroes in the League  Aquaman s estranged wife Mera gave him an ultimatum to stay with either the group or with her to salvage their marriage  Their marriage did not survive as long as they hoped and ended in a bitter domestic dispute  ending with the police knocking at their door  She took everything  even the family dog  Fan response to the series  new direction was largely negative and even the return of Batman to the team in Justice League of America  250 could not halt the decline of the series  Reader sentiment regarding this incarnation of the Justice League has since been metatextually reflected in the comics themselves  In volume 2 issue  31 the character of Zatanna says   With our current line up we couldn t beat Justice League Detroit   to which Dr  Light responds   Don t be ridiculous  Everybody can beat Detroit   The final storyline for the original Justice League of America series   258 261  by writer J  M  DeMatteis and artist Luke McDonnell  16  culminated a story arc involving long time Justice League enemy Professor Ivo s murders of Vibe and Steel and the resignations of Vixen  Gypsy  and the Elongated Man during the events of DC s Legends mini series  which saw the team disband   edit  Modern incarnations  edit  Justice League International Main articles  Justice League International and Justice League Europe The 1986 company wide crossover featured the formation of a new Justice League  The new team was dubbed  Justice League  then  Justice League International   JLI  and was given a mandate with less of an American focus  The new series  written by Keith Giffen and J  M  DeMatteis with art by Kevin Maguire 17   and later Adam Hughes   added quirky humor to the team s stories  In this incarnation  the membership consisted partly of heroes from Earths that  prior to their merging in the Crisis on Infinite Earths  were separate  The initial team included Batman  Black Canary  Blue Beetle  Captain Marvel  Doctor Light  a new Japanese female character  emerging from the Crisis of Infinite Earths  not the supervillain who had appeared previously   Doctor Fate  Martian Manhunter  Mister Miracle  and Guy Gardner  and soon after inception  added Booster Gold  Captain Atom  Fire  then known as the Global Guardians  Green Flame   Ice  then known as the Global Guardians  Icemaiden   and two Rocket Reds  one was a Manhunter spy  and one was Dimitri Pushkin   The Giffen DeMatteis team worked on Justice League for five years and closed out their run with the  Breakdowns  storyline in 1991 and 1992  18  The series  humorous tone and high level of characterization proved very popular but writers following Giffen and DeMatteis were unable to maintain the same balance of humor and heroics  resulting in the decline of the series  popularity  New writers gave the storylines a more serious tone and re focused the team on America  resulting in the book being re branded Justice League America  By the mid  to late 1990s  with the series  commercial success fading  it was eventually canceled  along with spinoffs Justice League Europe  Extreme Justice  and Justice League Task Force

team  all the various branch teams were disbanded  on a single title  A Justice League of America formed in the September 1996 limited series Justice League  A Midsummer s Nightmare by Mark Waid and Fabian Nicieza  which reunited the  Original Seven  of the League for the first time since Crisis on Infinite Earths  In 1997  DC Comics launched a new Justice League series titled JLA  written by Grant Morrison with art by Howard Porter and inker John Dell  This series  in an attempt at a  back to basics  approach  used as its core the team s original seven members  or their successors   Superman  Batman  Wonder Woman  Aquaman  Flash  Wally West   Green Lantern  Kyle Rayner   and the Martian Manhunter  Additionally  the team received a new headquarters  the  Watchtower   based on the Moon  Morrison introduced the idea of the JLA allegorically representing a pantheon of gods  with their different powers and personalities  incorporating such characters as Zauriel  Big Barda  Orion  Huntress  Barbara Gordon  Oracle   Steel  John Henry Irons   and Plastic Man  He also had temporaries as Aztek  Tomorrow Woman  and Green Arrow  Connor Hawke   Under Morrison  the series pitted the League against a variety of enemies  ranging from murderous White Martians  renegade angels  a new incarnation of the Injustice Gang led by Lex Luthor  the Key awakened from a coma  to the villainy of new villain Prometheus  the alien species of existing JLA villain Starro the Conqueror  revamped as a monstrous creature known as  The Star Conquerer   and Captain Atom villain General Wade Eiling  who transformed a cadre of Marines into deformed super powered beings known as  The Ultra Marines  as well as put his mind into the body of the indestructible Shaggy Man  and a futuristic Darkseid  Morrison s run itself featured a myth arc involving the New Gods preparing the Earth for battle against a creature known as  Maggedon   a super sentient weapon of mass destruction that was approaching Earth  that culminated in the final Morrison arc  World War III   The run also had its share of editorial problems  such as Morrison s need to adapt to Superman s changing powers  the death of Wonder Woman and the loss of Green Arrow Connor Hawke  due to plans for a Kevin Smith penned Green Arrow series  Still  JLA quickly became DC s best selling title  19  a position it enjoyed off and on for several years  20  Despite this  DC did not create continuing spinoff series as it had done before  Morrison departed with issue  41  after which the book saw runs by Mark Waid and Joe Kelly  Subsequent to this  the series switched to a series of rotating writers with issue  91 while Kelly  via JLA  100  was given a the mini series Justice League Elite  which featured Green Arrow  Flash  and several other Kelly created characters  The new format saw stories by John Byrne  Chuck Austen  and Kurt Busiek  Geoff Johns and Allan Heinberg would take over the book with  115  which saw a multi part storyline that dealt with the aftermath of Identity Crisis  and served as a lead in to the events of  Infinite Crisis   as Superboy Prime destroyed the Watchtower at the end of issue  119

Lantern  Hal Jordan   Black Canary  Red Arrow  Green Arrow s former sidekick   Red Tornado  Vixen  Black Lightning  and Hawkgirl  The first arc of the series focused upon Red Tornado and pitted the team against a new intelligent incarnation of Solomon Grundy and the rebuilt Amazo  The new incarnation of the team has two main headquarters  linked by a transporter  The first site is The Hall  which in mainstream DC Universe is a refurnished version of the Justice Society of America and the All Star Squadron s former headquarters located in Washington  D C  Black Canary is elected as the first official Chairperson after the fight against Amazo and Solomon Grundy  and led both the Justice League and Justice Society in a complex quest to reunite time lost members of the pre Crisis Legion of Super Heroes  who had been sent back in time to free both Bart Allen and Flash from the other dimensional realm of the Speed Force  Meltzer left the series at the end of issue  12  with one

setting up the Salvation Run tie in miniseries  Also  roster members Red Tornado and Geo Force were written out  McDuffie s initial issues received mixed reviews and experienced minor conroversy due to fan favorite Hal Jordan s removal in favor of Stewart  Jordan ended up being restored to the roster by issue  19 of the series  only to be removed once again by issue  31 once Justice League  Cry for Justice was completed and ready to be shipped  Issue  21 saw the return of Libra and the Human Flame  setting up their appearances in Final Crisis  Later issues would resolve issues involving Vixen s power level increase and see the integration of the Milestone Comics characters the Shadow Cabinet and Icon  who fought the Justice League over the remains of the villainous Doctor Light  The group suffered greater losses during Final Crisis with the deaths of Martian Manhunter and Batman  as well as the resignations of Superman and Wonder Woman  who could no longer devote themselves full time to the League due to the events of the New Krypton and Rise of the Olympian storylines in their respective titles  Hal Jordan would also resign as well  clearing the way for John Stewart s return to the team  Black Canary  now team leader  found herself declaring the League no more  though the group would continue with Canary taking a secondary role in the group  Her last act as leader would be assigning John Stewart and Firestorm the task of hunting down the Human Flame  for his part in the murder of Martian Manhunter  as seen in the Final Crisis Aftermath  Run  miniseries  Vixen would

James Robinson was announced as the new Justice League of America writer  23  Wein s fill in run would be published as  Justice League  Cry For Justice  neared its conclusion  as Vixen and Black Canary s group  sans John Stewart  would confront Hal Jordan and Green Arrow s makeshift Justice League group  which had stumbled upon a plot by the villain Prometheus that had resulted in much death and carnage  During the confrontation over Jordan s group using torture to extra information from the villains being blackmailed into carrying out Prometheus  plan  both Roy Harper and Supergirl would discover that one of Jordan s heroes  Captain Marvel Jr   was really Prometheus in disguise  In the ensuing battle  the League would suffer horrible losses  Roy Harper was maimed and his daughter Lian and hundreds of thousands of people in Star City would be killed by a doomsday device Prometheus activated  Vixen would have her leg broken and Plastic Man would have his powers permanently scrambled  making him a slowly disintegrating puddle creature  To save other cities from being destroyed like Star City  the League reluctantly allowed Prometheus to go free  However  Green Arrow  with help from the Shade  would track down and kill Prometheus  Following the events of  Blackest Night   Hal Jordan and Donna Troy begin the task of rebuilding the League  with Green Arrow  the Atom  Batman  Mon El

feature storyline for issues 48 50  25  Under Robinson  the title experienced mixed reviews and lower  but stable  sales than under Meltzer and McDuffie  with negative fan respone being leveled at the series due to its usage of lesser known heroes instead of more popular Justice League members  DC eventually announced that Saint Walker of the Blue Lantern Corps would be joining the Justice League during a tie in to the Reign of Doomsday crossover  but the character did not become a full member due to the cancellation of the title  26  The series ended with issue  60 in August 2011  with the

removed   July 2011  In a story told in flashback in 1963 s Justice League of America  9  Earth was infiltrated by the Appelaxians  Competing alien warriors were sent to see who could conquer Earth first to determine who will become the new ruler of their home planet  The aliens  attacks drew the attentions of Superman  Batman  Wonder Woman  Flash  Barry Allen   Green Lantern  Hal Jordan   Aquaman  and Martian Manhunter  While the superheroes individually defeated most of the invaders  the heroes fell prey to a single competitor s attack  only by working together were they able to defeat the competitor  For many years  the heroes heralded this adventure as the event that prompted them to agree to pool resources when confronted with similar menaces  Years later  however  as revealed in Justice League of America  144   Green Arrow uncovered inconsistencies in League records and extracted admissions from his colleagues that the seven founders had actually formed the League after the Martian Manhunter was rescued from Martian forces by the other six founders  along with several other heroes including Robin  Robotman  Congo Bill Congorilla  Rex the Wonder Dog  and even Lois Lane  Green Lantern participated in this first adventure solely as Hal Jordan  due to the fact that he had yet to become the costumed hero at that time  the biggest inconsistency Arrow found  as they celebrated the earlier incident s date  while recounting only the later one s events   When the group formalized their agreement  they suppressed news of it because of anti Martian hysteria  mirroring the real world backdrop of Martian scares and anti communist hysteria of the 1950s   Because the League members had not revealed their identities to each other at the time  they did not realize that Jordan and Green Lantern were one and the same when he turned up in costume during the event described in  9  While most subsequent accounts of the League have made little mention of this first adventure  the animated Justice League series adapted this tale as the origin of the League as well  1989 s Secret Origins  32 updated Justice League of America  9 s origin for Post Crisis continuity  Differences included the inclusion of the original Black Canary as a founding member and the absence of Batman  Wonder Woman  and Superman  the 1960s time frame was retained  but the post Crisis versions of DC s three biggest stars were young and early in their careers in the late 1980s   Additionally  while Hal Jordan served as the public face of the Justice League  this iteration of the League s origin cast the Flash as the team s unofficial leader  since it was Allen who usually came up with the plans that best utilized everyone s powers  1998 s JLA  Year One limited series  by Mark Waid  Brian Augustyn  and Barry Kitson  further expanded upon the Secret Origins depiction  with the revelation that the group was secretly financed by Oliver Queen  a k a  the superhero Green Arrow  It also stated that Superman rejected membership into the group  leading to much animus between him and the other  founders  during the early years of the group  In 1994 s Justice League Task Force  16  during Zero Hour  an unknown superhuman named Triumph appeared  In a plotline never explored before  Triumph was revealed to have been a founding member of the Justice League and was their leader  On his first mission with the fledgling Justice League Triumph seemingly  saved the world  but was teleported into a dimensional limbo that also affected the timestream  resulting in no one having any memory of him  This explained how all the heroes ended up in Washington for their first meeting  Further convolutions came with the issue of Batman s involvement with the League  during the 1990s  the editors of Batman sought to distance Batman from the Justice League  to the point of demanding that Batman s entire Justice League membership be removed from the group s canon  According to Christopher Priest  this  Batman was never in the Justice League  edict came down ironically after DC published Justice League America Annual  9  which featured Batman as a member of the League during its early days  The edict itself was largely haphazardly enforced  while Mark Waid had Batman proclaim to have never been a member of the League in Justice League Incarnations  7  other writers such as Grant Morrison and Keith Giffen took the stance that Batman had simply never joined the team until the Justice League International era  citation needed  This edict was ultimately dropped by the early 2000s  as Batman s involvement with the League is now referenced heavily by later writers such as Brad Meltzer  The convoluted change made to Hawkman s background in the wake of the launching of the Hawkworld ongoing series  in 1990  resulted in a retcon where the original Golden Age Justice Society Golden Age Hawkman  Carter Hall was now a member of the team as opposed to Katar Hol  who would now not join the group until 1994 s Justice League America  0   The details of how Carter Hall joined the team  would be revealed in the 2001 Justice League Incarnations  1  with the revelation that Carter joined the team to serve as a mentor for then young heroes  In 2006 s Infinite Crisis  7  the formation of  New Earth   the new name for the Post Crisis Earth  resulted in the retcon that Wonder Woman was a founding member of the Justice League in the early days  In Brad Meltzer s Justice League of America  vol  2   0  2006   it was also revealed that both Superman and Batman were founding members as well  52   Week 51 confirmed that the 1989 Secret Origins and JLA  Year One origins were still in canon at that time  with Superman  Batman  and Wonder Woman joining the team  consisting of Aquaman  Black Canary  Flash  Green Lantern  and Martian Manhunter  with founding members  status shortly after the group s formation  37  However  in various issues  particularly issue  12  of the 2006 Justice League of America series  the founding members of the Justice League are shown to be  Superman  Batman  Wonder Woman  Green Lantern  Hal Jordan   Flash  Barry Allen   Aquaman  and the Martian Manhunter  With much of DC s past history rebooted by the 2011  Flashpoint  event  an entirely new origin for the League is introduced in the subsequent Justice League series which debuted in September 2011  Issue  1 portrays the first meeting between Batman and Hal Jordan  with the two encountering each other during a battle against a Parademon in Gotham City  After realizing the creature is extraterrestrial in origin  the two heroes head to Metropolis to seek out Superman  who is a known alien in the new continuity   and are attacked by him  38  Later  after a brief fight

Amazing Life of Stan Lee  Fireside Books  ISBN 978 0684873053     Apocryphal legend has it that in 1961  either Jack Liebowitz or Irwin Donenfeld of DC Comics  then known as National Periodical Publications  bragged about DC s success with the Justice League  which had debuted in The Brave and the Bold  28  February 1960  before going on to its own title  to publisher Martin Goodman  whose holdings included the nascent Marvel Comics  during a game of golf  However  film producer and comics historian Michael Uslan partly debunked the story in a letter published in Alter Ego  43  December 2004   pp  43 44    Irwin said he never played golf with Goodman  so the story is untrue  I heard this story more than a couple of times while sitting in the lunchroom at DC s 909 Third Avenue and 75 Rockefeller Plaza office as Sol Harrison and  production chief  Jack Adler were schmoozing with some of us     who worked for DC during our college summers      T he way I heard the story from Sol was that Goodman was playing with one of the heads of Independent News  not DC Comics  though DC owned Independent News       As the distributor of DC Comics  this man certainly knew all the sales figures and was in the best position to tell this tidbit to Goodman      Of course  Goodman would want to be playing golf with this fellow and be in his good graces      Sol worked closely with Independent News  top management over the decades and would have gotten this story straight from the horse s mouth    Goodman  a publishing trend follower aware of the JLA s strong sales  confirmably directed his comics editor  Stan Lee  to create a comic book series about a team of superheroes  According to Lee in Origins of Marvel Comics  Simon and Schuster Fireside Books  1974   p  16    Martin mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by National Comics seemed to be selling better than most  It was a book called The  sic  Justice League of America and it was composed of a team of superheroes        If the Justice League is selling    spoke he   why don t we put out a comic book that features a team of superheroes       McAvennie  Michael  Dolan  Hannah  ed   2010    1960s   DC
