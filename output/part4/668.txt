was first sighted by Europeans in 1498 during the third voyage of Christopher Columbus to the new world  At the time the indigenous Island Caribs  Kalinago  who lived there called it Camahogne  The Spaniards did not permanently settle on Camahogne  The English failed in their attempt at settlement in 1609  French colony  1649 1763  On March 17  1649  a French expedition of 203 men from Martinique led by Jacques du Parquet founded a permanent settlement on Grenada  Within months this led to conflict with the local islanders which lasted until 1654 when the island was completely subjugated by the French  4  Those indigenous islanders who survived either left for neighboring islands or retreated to remoter parts of Grenada where they were marginalised the last distinct communities disappeared during the eighteenth century  Warfare continued during the seventeenth century between the French on Grenada and the Caribs of present day Dominica and St  Vincent and the Grenadines  The French named the new French colony La Grenade  and the economy was initially based on sugar cane and indigo  The French established a capital known as Fort Royal  later St  George   To shelter from hurricanes the French navy would often take refuge in the capital s natural harbour  as no nearby French islands had a natural harbour to compare with that of Fort Royal  The British captured Grenada during the Seven Years  War in 1762  British colony  1763 1950  Grenada was formally ceded to Britain by the Treaty of Paris in 1763  The French re captured the island during the American War of Independence  after Comte d Estaing won the bloody land and naval Battle of Grenada in July 1779  However the island was restored to Britain with the Treaty of Versailles in 1783  Britain was hard pressed to overcome a pro French revolt in 1795 1796 led by Julien Fedon  Nutmeg was introduced to Grenada in 1843 when a merchant ship called in on its way to England from the East Indies  The ship had a small quantity of nutmeg trees on board which they left in Grenada  and this was the beginning of Grenada s nutmeg industry that now supplies nearly forty percent of the world s annual crop  5  In 1877 Grenada was made a Crown colony  Theophilus A  Marryshow founded the Representative Government Association  RGA  in 1917 to agitate for a new and participative constitutional dispensation for the Grenadian people  Partly as a result of Marryshow s lobbying  the Wood Commission of 1921 1922 concluded that Grenada was ready for constitutional reform in the form of a  modified  Crown colony government  This modification granted Grenadians the right to elect 5 of the 15 members of the Legislative Council  on a restricted property franchise enabling the wealthiest 4  of adult Grenadians to vote  6  The capital St  George s  Towards independence  1950 1974  In 1950 Eric Gairy founded the Grenada United Labour Party  initially as a trades union  which led the 1951 general strike for better working conditions  This sparked great unrest so many buildings were set ablaze that the disturbances became known as the  red sky  days and the British authorities had to call in military reinforcements to help regain control of the situation  On October 10  1951  Grenada held its first general elections on the basis of universal adult suffrage  7   Eric Gairy s Grenada United Labour Party won 6 of the 8 seats contested  7  From 1958 to 1962 Grenada was part of the Federation of the West Indies  On March 3  1967  Grenada was granted full autonomy over its internal affairs as an Associated State  Herbert Blaize was the first Premier of the Associated State of Grenada from March to August 1967  Eric Gairy served as Premier from August 1967 until February 1974  Independence and revolution  1974 1983  Independence was granted in 1974 under the leadership of the Premier  Sir Eric Matthew Gairy  who became the first Prime Minister of Grenada  Civil conflict gradually broke out between Eric Gairy s government and some opposition parties including the New Jewel Movement  NJM   Gairy s party won elections in 1976  but the opposition did not accept the result  accusing it of fraud  In 1979 the New Jewel Movement under Maurice Bishop launched a paramilitary attack on the government resulting in its overthrow  The constitution was suspended and Bishop s  People s Revolutionary Government  ruled subsequently by decree  Cuban doctors  teachers  and technicians were invited in to help develop health  literacy  and agriculture over the next few years  Agrarian reforms started by the Gairy government were continued and greatly expanded under the revolutionary government of Maurice Bishop  Invasion by the United States Main article  Invasion

2011  Members of the Eastern Caribbean Defence Force during the Invasion of Grenada Some years later a dispute developed between Bishop and certain high ranking members of the NJM  Though Bishop cooperated with Cuba and the USSR on various trade and foreign policy issues  he sought to maintain a  non aligned  status  Bishop had been taking his time making Grenada wholly socialist  encouraging private sector development in an attempt to make the island a popular tourist destination  Hardline Marxist party members  including Communist Deputy Prime Minister Bernard Coard  deemed Bishop insufficiently revolutionary and demanded that he either step down or enter into a power sharing arrangement  On October 19  1983  Bernard Coard and his wife Phyllis  backed by the Grenadian Army  led a coup against the government of Maurice Bishop and placed Bishop under house arrest  These actions led to street demonstrations in various parts of the island  Bishop had enough support from the population that he was eventually freed after a demonstration in the capital  When Bishop attempted to resume power  he was captured and executed by soldiers along with seven others  including government cabinet ministers  The Coard regime then put the island under martial law  After the execution of Bishop  the People s Revolutionary Army formed a military government with General Hudson Austin as chairman  The army declared a four day total curfew  during which  it said  anyone leaving their home without approval would be shot on sight  8  The overthrow of a moderate government by one which was strongly pro communist worried U S  President Ronald Reagan  Particularly concerning was the presence of Cuban construction workers and military personnel who were building a 10 000 foot  3 000 m  airstrip on Grenada  Bishop had stated the purpose of the airstrip was to allow commercial jets to land  but U S  military analysts argued that the only reason for constructing such a long and reinforced runway was so that it could be used by heavy military transport planes  The contractors  American and European companies  and the EEC  which provided partial funding  all claimed the airstrip did not have military capabilities  9  Reagan was worried that Cuba   under the direction of the Soviet Union   would use Grenada as a refueling stop for Cuban and Soviet airplanes loaded with weapons destined for Central American communist insurgents  10  On October 25 combined forces from the United States and from the Regional Security System  RSS  based in Barbados invaded Grenada in an operation codenamed Operation Urgent Fury  The U S  stated this was done at the behest of Dame Eugenia Charles of Dominica  While the Governor General Sir Paul Scoon later stated that he had also requested the invasion  it was highly criticised by head of state HM Queen Elizabeth II citation needed  and the governments of Britain  Trinidad and Tobago and Canada  The United Nations General Assembly condemned it as  a flagrant violation of international law  by a vote of 108 in favor to 9  with 27 abstentions  11  12  The United Nations Security Council considered a similar resolution  which failed to pass when vetoed by the United States  citation needed  After the invasion of the island nation  the pre revolutionary Grenadian constitution came into operation once again  Eighteen members of the PRG and the PRA  army  were arrested after the invasion on charges related to the murder of Maurice Bishop and seven others  The eighteen included the top political leadership of Grenada at the time of the execution as well as the entire military chain of command directly responsible for the operation that led to the executions  Fourteen were sentenced to death  one was found not guilty and three were sentenced to forty five years in prison  The death sentences were eventually commuted to terms of imprisonment  Those in prison have become known as the Grenada 17  Grenada since 1983 When U S  troops withdrew from Grenada in December 1983  Nicholas Brathwaite of the National Democratic Congress was appointed prime minister of an interim administration by the Scoon until elections could be organized  The first democratic elections since 1976 were held in December 1984 and were won by the Grenada National Party under Herbert Blaize who served as prime minister until his death in December 1989  Ben Jones succeeded Blaize as prime minister and served until the March 1990 election  which was won by the National Democratic Congress under Nicholas Brathwaite who returned as prime minister for a second time until he resigned in February 1995  He was succeeded by George Brizan who served until the June 1995 election which was won by the New National Party under Keith Mitchell who went on to win the 1999 and 2003 elections and served for a record 13 years until 2008  In 2000 2002  much of the controversy of the late 1970s and early 1980s was once again brought into the public consciousness with the opening of the truth and reconciliation commission  The commission was chaired by a Roman Catholic priest  Father Mark Haynes  and was tasked with uncovering injustices arising from the PRA  Bishop s regime  and before  It held a number of hearings around the country  Brother Robert Fanovich  head of Presentation Brothers  College  PBC  in St  George s tasked some of his senior students with conducting a research project into the era and specifically into the fact that Maurice Bishop s body was never discovered  13  Paterson also uncovered that there was still a lot of resentment in Grenadian society resulting from the era and a feeling that there were many injustices still unaddressed  On September 7  2004  after being hurricane free for forty nine years  the island was directly hit by Hurricane Ivan  Ivan struck as a Category 3 hurricane and caused 90  of the homes to be damaged or destroyed  On July 14  2005  Hurricane Emily  a Category 1 hurricane at the time  struck the northern part of the island with 80 knot  150 km h  92 mph  winds  causing an estimated USD  110 million  EC  297 million  worth of damage  By December 2005  96  of all hotel rooms were to be open for business and to have been upgraded in facilities and strengthened to an improved building code  citation needed  The agricultural industry and in particular the nutmeg industry suffered serious losses  but that event has begun changes in crop management and it is hoped that as new nutmeg trees gradually mature  the industry will return to its pre Ivan position as a major supplier in the Western world  citation needed  In April 2007  Grenada jointly hosted  along with several other Caribbean nations  the 2007 Cricket World Cup  The island s prime minister was CARICOM Representative on cricket and was instrumental in having the World Cup Games brought to the region  After Hurricane Ivan  the government of the People s Republic of China  PRC  paid for the new  40 million national stadium and provided the aid of over 300 laborers to build and repair it  14  During the opening ceremony  the anthem of the Republic of China  ROC  Taiwan  was accidentally played instead of the PRC s anthem  leading to the firing of top officials  15  16  The 2008 election was won by the National Democratic Congress under Tillman Thomas  Geography Main

largely focused in the southwest region around St George  the airport and the coastal strip  however  ecotourism is growing in significance  Most of these small ecofriendly guesthouses are located in the Saint David and Saint John parishes  You will find a lot of different accommodations from luxury like the Spice Island Beach Resort to small cottages resorts like Mango Bay Cottages The tourism industry is increasing dramatically with the construction of a large cruise ship pier and esplanade  Up to 4 cruise ships per day were visiting St  Georges in 2007 2008 during the cruise ship season

citizens are descendants of the African slaves brought by the English and French  few of the indigenous Carib and Arawak population survived the French purge at Sauteurs  A small percentage of descendants of indentured workers from India were brought to Grenada mainly from the North Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh between May 1  1857   January 10  1885  Today  Grenadians of Indian descent comprise the second largest ethnic group  i e  after Afro Grenadians   There is also a small community of French and English descendants  The rest of the population is of mixed descent  A school on Grand Anse beach Grenada  like many of the Caribbean islands is subject to a large amount of migration  with a large number of young people wanting to leave the island to seek life elsewhere  With 110 000 people living in Grenada  estimates and census data suggest that there are at least that number of Grenadian born people in other parts of the Caribbean  such as Barbados and Trinidad  and at least that number again in First World countries  Popular migration points for Grenadians further north include New York City  Toronto  the United Kingdom  London and Yorkshire predominantly   see Grenadians in the UK  and sometimes Montreal  or as far south as Australia  This means that probably around a third of those born in Grenada still live there  The official language  English  is used in the government  but Grenadian Creole is considered the lingua franca of the island  French Patois  Antillean Creole  is also spoken by about 10  20  the population  Some Hindi Bhojpuri terms are still spoken amongst the Indian descendants  mostly those pertaining to the kitchen  such as aloo  geera  karela  seim  chownkay  and baylay  The term bhai  which means  brother  in Urdu and Hindi  is a common form of greeting amongst Indo Grenadians males of equal status  Religion Religion Percentage citation needed  Roman Catholic 53 Anglican 14 Other Protestant 33 Rastafari Spiritist 1 3 Hindu 0 7 Muslim 0 3 Buddhist 0 2 Baha i 0 2 Including a small community of Rastafarians living in Grenada  most of the population belong to Christian churches  About half of the population are Roman Catholic  while the largest Protestant denomination is Anglican  with Presbyterian and Seventh Day Adventist taking up much of the remainder  Most churches have denomination based schools but are open to all  There are a small Hindu and Muslim populations descended mostly from Gujarati Indian immigrants who came during the colonial period and set up merchant shops  Culture Main articles  Culture of Grenada and Music of Grenada See also  Cricket in the West Indies 1965 carnival Although French influence on Grenadian culture is much less visible than on other Caribbean islands  surnames and place names in French remain  and the every day language is laced with French words and the local dialect or Patois  Stronger French influence is found in the well seasoned spicy food and styles of cooking similar to those found in New Orleans  and some French architecture has survived from the 18th century  Island culture is heavily influenced by the African roots of most of the Grenadians  but Indian and Carib Amerindian influence is also seen with dhal puri  rotis  Indian sweets  cassava and curries in the cuisine  The  oildown  is considered to be the national dish  The phrase  oil down  refers to a dish cooked in coconut milk until all the milk is absorbed  leaving a bit of coconut oil in the bottom of the pot  Early recipes call for a mixture of salted pigtail  pigs feet  trotters   salt beef and chicken  dumplings made from flour  provision  breadfruit  green banana  yam and potatoes  Callaloo leaves are some times used to retain the steam and for extra flavour  19  Soca  calypso  and reggae set the mood for Grenada s annual Carnival activities  Over the years rap music became famous among Grenadian youths  and there have been numerous young rappers emerging in the islands underground rap scene  Zouk is also being slowly introduced onto the island  The islanders  African and Carib Amerindian heritage plays an influential role in many aspects of Grenada s culture  As with other islands from the Caribbean  cricket is the national and most popular sport and is an intrinsic part of Grenadian culture  An important aspect of Grenadian culture is the tradition of story telling  with folk tales bearing both African and French influences  The character  Anancy  a spider god who is a trickster  originated in West Africa and is prevalent on other Caribbean islands as well  French influence can be seen in La Diablesse  a well dressed she devil  and Ligaroo  from Loup Garoux   a werewolf  See also Geography portal North America portal Caribbean portal Commonwealth
