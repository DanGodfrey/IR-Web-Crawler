 also known as M xico D F   or simply D F   is the Federal District  Distrito Federal   capital of Mexico and seat of the federal powers of the Mexican Union  9  It is a federal entity within Mexico which is not part of any one of the 31 Mexican states but belongs to the federation as a whole  Mexico City is the country s largest city as well as its most important political  cultural  educational and financial center  As an  alpha  global city 10  Mexico City is one of the most important financial centers in North America  11  It is located in the Valley of Mexico  Valle de M xico   a large valley in the high plateaus at the center of Mexico  at an altitude of 2 240 metres  7 350 ft   The city consists of sixteen boroughs  The 2009 estimated population for the city proper was around 8 84 million people  12  and has a land area of 1 485 square kilometres  573 sq mi   13  According to the most recent definition agreed upon by the federal and state governments  the Mexico City metropolitan area population is 21 2 million people  12  making it the largest metropolitan area in the western hemisphere and the fifth largest agglomeration in the world  14  Mexico City has a gross domestic product  GDP  of  390 billion US  in 2008  making Mexico City the eighth richest city in the world  15  The city was responsible for generating 21  of Mexico s Gross Domestic Product and the metropolitan area accounted for 34  of total national GDP  16  The city was originally built on an island of Lake Texcoco by the Aztecs in 1325 as Tenochtitlan  which was almost completely destroyed in the 1521 siege of Tenochtitlan  and subsequently redesigned and rebuilt in accordance with the Spanish urban standards  In 1524  the municipality of Mexico City was established  known as M xico Tenochtitl n  17  and as of 1585 it was officially known as La Ciudad de M xico  Mexico City   17  Mexico City served as the political  administrative and financial center of a major part of the Spanish colonial empire  18  After independence from Spain was achieved  the Federal District was created in 1824  After years of demanding greater political autonomy  residents were given the right to directly elect the Head of Government and the representatives of the unicameral Legislative Assembly by popular vote in 1997  Ever since  the left wing Party of the Democratic Revolution  PRD  has controlled both of them  19  In recent years  the local government has passed a wave of liberal policies  such as abortion on request to any woman up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy  a limited form of euthanasia  no fault divorce and same sex marriage  Contents 1 History of Mexico City 1 1 Aztec period 1 2 Spanish conquest of Tenochtitl n 1 3 The rebuilding of the city as Mexico City 1 4 Growth of

article  History of Mexico City  edit  Aztec period Main article  Tenochtitlan Market in Tlatelolco by Diego Rivera The city now known as Mexico City was founded by the Mexica people  later known as the Aztecs  in 1325  The old Mexica city is now referred to as Tenochtitlan  The Mexica were one of the last of the Nahuatl speaking peoples who migrated to this part of the Valley of Mexico after the fall of the Toltec Empire  Their presence was resisted by the peoples who were already in the valley  but the Mexica were able to establish a city on a small island on the western side of Lake Texcoco  The Mexica themselves had a story about how their city was founded  after being led to the island by their principal god  Huitzilopochtli  According to the story  the god indicated the site where they were to build their home with a sign   an eagle perched on a nopal cactus with a snake in its beak  Between 1325 and 1521  Tenochtitlan grew in size and strength  eventually dominating the other city states around Lake Texcoco  and in the Valley of Mexico  When the Spaniards arrived  the Aztec Empire reached much of Mesoamerica  touching both the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean  Scholars estimate that between 200 000 and 250 000 people lived in Tenochtitlan in 1500  more than four times the population of London at that time   edit  Spanish conquest of Tenochtitl n Model of the first naval battle between the Spanish and Aztec in lake Texcoco  After landing in Veracruz  Hern n Cort s heard about the great city and the long standing rivalries and grievances against it  Although Cort s came to Mexico with a very small army  he was able to persuade many of the other native peoples to help him destroy Tenochtitlan  20  Cort s first saw Tenochtitl n on November 8  1519  21  Upon viewing it for the first time  Cort s and his men were stunned by its beauty and size  The Spaniards marched along the causeway leading into the city from Iztapalapa  Although Montezuma came out from the center of Tenochtitl n to greet them and exchange gifts  the camaraderie did not last long  22  Cort s put Montezuma under house arrest  hoping to rule through him  23  Tensions increased until  on the night of June 30  1520   during a struggle commonly known as  La Noche Triste    the Aztec revolted against the Spanish intrusion and managed to capture or drive out the Europeans and their Tlaxcalan allies  24  Cort s regrouped at Tlaxcala  The Aztecs thought the Spaniards were permanently gone  They elected a new king  Cuitl huac  but he died after a few months due to smallpox  the next king was Cuauht moc  25  Cort s decided to lay siege to Tenochtitl n in May 1521  For three months  the city suffered from the lack of food and water as well as the spread of smallpox brought by the Europeans  20  Cort s and his allies landed their forces in the south of the island and fought their way through the city  street by street  and house by house  26  Finally  Cuauht moc had to surrender in August 1521  20   edit  The rebuilding of the city as Mexico City Mexico City painting of 1628 The Spaniards practically razed Tenochtitl n  Cort s first settled in Coyoac n  but decided to rebuild the Aztec site to erase all traces of the old order  21  Cort s did not establish an independent  conquered territory under his own personal rule  but remained loyal to the Spanish crown  The first viceroy of the new domain arrived in Mexico City fourteen years later  By that time  the city had again become a city state  having power that extended far beyond the city s established borders  27  Although the Spanish preserved Tenochtitl n s basic layout  they built Catholic churches over the old Aztec temples and claimed the imperial palaces for themselves  27  Tenochtitl n was renamed  Mexico   its alternative form name  only because the Spanish found this easier to say  21   edit  Growth of the colonial city The  ngel de la Independencia was built to celebrate Mexico s independence centennial Colonial style architecture in the historic center of Mexico City  The city grew as the population did  coming up against the lake s waters  The 16th century saw a proliferation of churches  many of which can still be seen today in the historic center  27  Economically  Mexico City prospered as a result of trade  Unlike Brazil or Peru  Mexico had easy contact with both the Atlantic and Pacific worlds  Although the Spanish crown tried to completely regulate all commerce in the city  it had only partial success  28  The concept of nobility flourished in New Spain in a way not seen in other parts of the Americas  Spaniards encountered a society in which the concept of nobility mirrored that of their own  Spaniards respected the indigenous order of nobility and added to it  In the ensuing centuries  a noble title in Mexico did not mean one exercised great political power as one s power was limited even if the accumulation of wealth was not  29  The concept of nobility in Mexico was not political but rather a very conservative Spanish social one  based on proving the worthiness of the family  Most of these families proved their worth by making fortunes in New Spain outside of the city itself  then spending the revenues in the capital  building churches  supporting charities and building extravagant palatial homes  The craze to build the most opulent home possible reached its height in the last half of the 18th century  Many of these homes can still be seen today  leading to Mexico City s nickname of  The city of palaces  given by Alexander Von Humboldt  21  27  29  The Grito de Dolores   Cry of Dolores   also known as El Grito de la Independencia   Cry of Independence    uttered from the small town of Dolores near Guanajuato on September 16  1810  is the event that marks the beginning of the Mexican War of Independence and is the most important national holiday observed in Mexico  The  Grito  was the battle cry of the Mexican War of Independence by Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla  a Roman Catholic priest  Hidalgo and several criollos were involved in a planned revolt against the Spanish colonial government  and the plotters were betrayed  Fearing his arrest  1  Hidalgo commanded his brother Mauricio as well as Ignacio Allende and Mariano Abasolo to go with a number of other armed men to make the sheriff release the pro independence inmates there on the night of September 15  They managed to set eighty free  2  Around 6 00 am September 16  1810  Hidalgo ordered the church bells to be rung and gathered his congregation  Flanked by Allende and Juan Aldama  he addressed the people in front of his church  encouraging them to revolt  The Battle of Guanajuato  the first major engagement of the insurgency  occurred four days later  Mexico s independence from Spain was effectively declared in the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire on September 27  1821  after a decade of war  30  Unrest followed for the next several decades  as different factions fought for control of Mexico  31  The Mexican Federal District was established by the new government and by the signing of their new constitution  where the concept of a federal district was adapted from The U S  constitution  32  Before this designation  Mexico City had served as the seat of government for both the State of Mexico and the nation as a whole  Texcoco and then Toluca became the capital of the state of Mexico  33   edit  The Battle of Mexico City The Mexican American War came to a close after the United States deployed combat units deep into Mexico resulting in the capture of Mexico City and Veracruz by the U S  Army s 1st  2nd  3rd and 4th Divisions  34  The invasion culminated with the storming of Chapultepec Castle in the city itself  35  The treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed in what is now the far north of the city  36  Events such as the Reform War left the city relatively untouched and it continued to grow  especially during the rule of President Porfirio D az  During this time  the city developed a modern infrastructure  such as roads  schools  transportation  and communication systems  However  the regime concentrated resources and wealth into the city while the rest languished in poverty   edit  Revolution Fast modern development eventually led to the Mexican Revolution  31  The most significant episode of this period for the city was the La decena tr gica   The Ten Tragic Days    a coup against President Francisco I  Madero and his vice president  Jos  Mar a Pino Su rez  Victoriano Huerta  chief general of the Federal Army saw a chance to take power  forcing Madero and Pino Suarez to sign resignations  The two were murdered later while on their way to prison  37   edit  20th century to present The northern  central  and western areas of the city are marked with hundreds of high rise buildings The history of the rest of the 20th century to the present focuses on the phenomenal growth of the city and its environmental and political consequences  In 1900  the population of Mexico City was about 500 000  38  The city began to grow rapidly westward in the early part of the 20th century 27  and then began to grow upwards in the 1950s  with the Torre Latinoamericana becoming the city s first skyscraper  20  The 1968 Olympic Games brought about the construction of large sporting facilities  27  In 1969  the Metro system was inaugurated  20  Explosive growth in the population of the city started from the 1960s  with the population overflowing the boundaries of the Federal District into the neighboring state of Mexico  especially to the north  northwest and northeast  Between 1960 and 1980 the city s population more than doubled to 8 831 079  27  In 1980  half of all the industrial jobs in Mexico were located in Mexico City  Under relentless growth  the Mexico City government could barely keep up with services  Villagers from the countryside who continued to pour into the city to escape poverty only compounded the city s problems  With no housing available  they took over lands surrounding the city  creating huge shantytowns that extended for many miles  31  This caused serious air and water pollution problems  as well as a sinking city due to overextraction of groundwater  groundwater related subsidence  39  Air and water pollution has been contained and improved in several areas due to government programs  the renovation of vehicles and the modernization of public transportation  The autocratic government that ruled Mexico City since the Revolution was tolerated  mostly because of the continued economic expansion since World War II  This was the case even though this government could not handle the population and pollution problems adequately  Nevertheless  discontent and protests began in the 1960s leading to the massacre of an unknown number of protesting students in Tlatelolco  31  Three years later  a demonstration in the Maestros avenue  organized by former members of the 1968 student movement  was violently repressed by a paramilitary group called  Los Halcones   composed of gang members and teenagers from many sports clubs who received training in the U S  On Thursday  September 19  1985  at 7 19 am local time  Mexico City was struck by an earthquake of magnitude 8 1 40  on the Richter scale  Although this earthquake was not as deadly or destructive as many similar events in Asia and other parts of Latin America  41  it proved to be a disaster politically for the one party government  The government was paralyzed by its own bureaucracy and corruption  forcing ordinary citizens to create and direct their own rescue efforts and to reconstruct much of the housing that was lost as well  42  However  the last straw may have been the controverted elections of 1988  That year  the presidency was set between the P R I  s candidate  Carlos Salinas de Gortari  and a coalition of left wing parties led by Cuauht moc C rdenas  son of the former president L zaro C rdenas  The counting system  fell  because coincidentally the light went out and suddenly  when it returned  the winning candidate was Salinas  even though C rdenas had the upper hand  As a result of the fraudulent election  C rdenas became a member of the Party of the Democratic Revolution  Discontent over the election eventually led Cuauht moc C rdenas to become the first elected mayor of Mexico City in 1997  C rdenas promised a more democratic government  and his party claimed some victories against crime  pollution  and other major problems  He resigned in 1999 to run for the presidency   edit  Geography Astronaut view of Mexico City Mexico City is located in the Valley of Mexico  sometimes called the Basin of Mexico  This valley is located in the Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt in the high plateaus of south central Mexico  43  44  It has a minimum altitude of 2 200 meters  7 217 feet  above sea level and is surrounded by mountains and volcanoes that reach elevations of over 5 000 meters  45  This valley has no natural drainage outlet for the waters that flow from the mountainsides  making the city vulnerable to flooding  Drainage was engineered through the use of canals and tunnels starting in the 17th century  43  45  The city primarily rests on what was Lake Texcoco  43  Seismic activity is frequent here  46  Lake Texcoco was drained starting from the 17th century  Although none of the lake waters remain  the city rests on the lake bed s heavily saturated clay  This soft base is collapsing due to the over extraction of groundwater  called groundwater related subsidence  Since the beginning of the 20th century  the city has sunk as much as nine meters in some areas  This sinking is causing problems with runoff and wastewater management  leading to flooding problems  especially during the rainy season  45  46  The entire lake bed is now paved over and most of the city s remaining forested areas lie in the southern boroughs of Milpa Alta  Tlalpan and Xochimilco  46  Geophysical maps of the Federal District Topography Hydrology Climate patterns  edit  Climate Cumbres del Ajusco National Park Mexico City has a subtropical highland climate  K ppen climate classification Cwb   due to its tropical location and high elevation  The lower region of the valley receives less rainfall than the upper regions of the south  the lower boroughs of Iztapalapa  Iztacalco  Venustiano Carranza and the west portion of Gustavo A  Madero are usually drier and warmer than the upper southern boroughs of Tlalpan and Milpa Alta  a mountainous region of pine and oak trees known as the range of Ajusco  The average annual temperature varies from 12 to 16  C  54 to 61  F   depending on the altitude of the borough  The lowest temperatures  usually registered during January and February  may reach  2 to  5  C  28 to 23  F   and are usually accompanied by snow showers on the southern regions of Ajusco  The maximum temperatures of late spring and summer may reach up to 32  C  90  F   Extremes range from  4 4  C  24 1  F  to 33 9  C  93 0  F   47  Overall precipitation is heavily concentrated in the summer months  and includes dense hail  The central valley of Mexico rarely gets precipitation in the form of snow during winter  the two last recorded instances of such an event were on March 5  1940 and January 12  1967  The region of the Valley of Mexico receives anti cyclonic systems  The weak winds of these systems do not allow for the dispersion  outside the basin  of the air pollutants which are produced by the 50 000 industries and 4 million vehicles operating in and around the metropolitan area  48  The area receives about 820 millimetres  32 3 in  of annual rainfall  which is concentrated from June through September October with little or no precipitation the remainder of the year  45  The area has two main seasons  The rainy season runs from June to October when winds bring in tropical moisture from the sea  The dry season runs from November to May  when the air is relatively drier  This dry season subdivides into a cold period and a warm period  The cold period spans from November to February when polar air masses push down from the north and keep the air fairly dry  The warm period extends from March to May when tropical winds again dominate but do not yet carry enough moisture for rain  49  Extremes Climate data for Mexico City  Mexico Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Average

areas of the City such as Tezozomoc park  Situated in a valley  and relying heavily on automobiles  the city suffers from poor air quality Originally  much of the valley laid beneath the waters of Lake Texcoco  a system of interconnected saline and freshwater lakes  The Aztecs built dikes to separate the fresh water used to raise crops in chinampas and to prevent recurrent floods  These dikes were destroyed during the siege of Tenochtitlan  and during colonial times the Spanish regularly drained the lake to prevent floods  Only a small section of the original lake remains  located outside the Federal District  in the municipality of Atenco  State of Mexico  In recent years  architects Teodoro Gonz lez de Le n and Alberto Kalach  along with a group of Mexican urbanists  engineers and biologists  have developed the project plan for Recovering the City of Lakes  The project  if approved by the government  will contribute to the supply of water from natural sources to the Valley of Mexico  the creation of new natural spaces  a great improvement in air quality  and greater population establishment planning  The federal and local governments have implemented numerous plans to alleviate the problem of air pollution  such as carbon monoxide   including the constant monitoring and reporting of environmental conditions  such as ozone and nitrogen oxides  51  If the levels of these two pollutants reach critical levels  contingency actions are implemented which may include closing factories  changing school hours  and extending the A day without a car program to two days of the week  51  To control air pollution  the government has instituted industrial technology improvements  a strict biannual vehicle emission inspection and the reformulation of gasoline and diesel fuels  51  Data from the city s 36 air quality monitoring stations show lead levels down 95 percent since 1990  while sulfur dioxide has fallen 86 percent  carbon monoxide 74 percent  and peak ozone levels 57 percent since 1991  51  In 1990  Patricia Saad Sotomayor reported in the Mexico City daily Exc lsior that  100 000 children die every year as a result of pollution in the Mexico City metropolitan area  250 000 people suffer from eye diseases  and life expectancy has been reduced by up to ten years  according to the National Environmentalist Groups   in a report to President Salinas  At the time  according to the United Nations pollution scale  which set 100 as the maximum level before grave health problems begin   Mexico City s level was 97 5  compared to 4 5 for New York City  and 2 5 for Milan  Turin  and Los Angeles  52  In 1986  the non urban forest areas of the southern boroughs were declared National Ecological Reserves by president Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado  Other areas of the Federal District became protected over the following years   edit  Politics  edit  Federal District Large urban upper middle class neighborhoods are common throughout the northern and western area  The Colonia Roma Santa Fe in the rainy season The Acta Constitutiva de la Federaci n of January 31  1824 and the Federal Constitution of October 4  1824 53  fixed the political and administrative organization of the United Mexican States after the Mexican War of Independence  In addition  Section XXVIII of Article 50 gave the new Congress the right to choose where the federal government would be located  This location would then be appropriated as federal land  with the federal government acting as the local authority  The two main candidates to become the capital were Mexico City and Quer taro  citation needed  However  due in large part to the persuasion of representative Servando Teresa de Mier  Mexico City was chosen because it was the center of the country s population and history  even though Quer taro was closer to the center geographically  The choice was official on November 18  1824  and Congress delineated a surface area of two leagues square  8 800 ac  centered on the Zocalo  This area was then separated from the State of Mexico  forcing that state s government to move from the Palace of the Inquisition  now Museum of Mexican Medicine  in the city to Texcoco  This area did not include the population centers of the towns of Coyoac n  Xochimilco  Mexicaltzingo and Tlalpan  all of which remained as part of the State of Mexico  54  In 1854  president Antonio L pez de Santa Anna  enlarged the area of the Federal District almost eightfold from the original 220 km2  80 sq mi  to 1 700 km2  660 sq mi   annexing the rural and mountainous areas to secure the strategic mountain passes to the south and southwest to protect the city in event of a foreign invasion   The Mexican American War had just been fought   The last changes to the limits of the Federal District were made between 1898 and 1902  reducing the area to the current 1 479 km2  571 sq mi  by adjusting the southern border with the state of Morelos  By that time  the total number of municipalities within the Federal District was twenty two  While the Federal District was ruled by the federal government through an appointed governor  the municipalities within it were autonomous  and this duality of powers created tension between the municipalities and the federal government for more than a century  In 1903 already  Porfirio D az largely reduced the powers of the municipalities within the Federal District  Eventually  in December 1928  the federal government decided to abolish all the municipalities of the Federal District  In place of the municipalities  the Federal District was divided into one  Central Department  and 13 delegaciones  boroughs  administered directly by the government of the Federal District  The Central Department was integrated by the former municipalities of Mexico City  Tacuba  Tacubaya and Mixcoac  In 1941  the General Anaya borough was merged to the Central Department  which was then renamed  Mexico City   thus reviving the name  but not the autonomous municipality   From 1941 to 1970  the Federal District was comprised by 12 delegaciones and Mexico City  In 1970 Mexico City was split into four different delegaciones  Cuauht moc  Miguel Hidalgo  Venustiano Carranza and Benito Ju rez  increasing the number of delegaciones to sixteen  Since then  in a de facto manner  the whole Federal District  whose delegaciones had by then almost formed a single urban area  began to be considered a synonym of Mexico City  However  the lack of a de jure stipulation left a legal vacuum that led to a number of sterile discussions about whether one concept had engulfed the other or if the latter had ceased to exist altogether  In 1993 this situation was solved by an amendment to the 44th article of the Constitution whereby Mexico City and the Federal District were set to be the same entity  This amendment was later introduced into the second article of the Statute of Government of the Federal District  55   edit  Political structure The National Palace of Mexico  Offices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Interior of the Mexico City Hall  Mexico City  being the seat of the powers of the

autonomy to manage their local affairs  citation needed  Some political groups even proposed that the Federal District be converted into the 32nd state of the federation  In response to the demands  in 1987 the Federal District received a greater degree of autonomy  with the elaboration the first Statute of Government  Estatuto de Gobierno   and the creation of an Assembly of Representatives  citation needed  In the 1990s  this autonomy was further expanded and  starting from 1997  residents can directly elect the head of government of the Federal District and the representatives of a

case in all legislatures in Mexico  by both single seat and proportional seats  making it a system of parallel voting  The Federal District is divided into 40 electoral constituencies of similar population which elect one representative by first past the post plurality  FPP   locally called  uninominal deputies   The Federal District as a whole constitutes a single constituency for the parallel election of 26 representatives by proportionality  PR  with open party lists  locally called  plurinominal deputies   Even though proportionality is only confined to the proportional seats  to prevent a part from being overrepresented  several restrictions apply in the assignation of the seats  namely  that no party can have more than 63  of all seats  both uninominal and plurinominal  In the 2006 elections leftist PRD got the absolute majority in the direct uninominal elections  securing 34 of the 40 FPP seats  As such  PRD was not assigned any plurinominal seat to comply with the law that prevents overrepresentation  The overall composition of the Legislative Assembly is  Political party FPP PR Total Party of the Democratic Revolution 31 3 34 National Action Party 9 6 15

Mexico City since the second half of the 20th century have usually been more liberal than those of the rest of the country  whether with the support of the federal government as was the case with the approval of several comprehensive environmental laws in the 1980s or through laws recently approved by the Legislative Assembly  In April of the same year  the Legislative Assembly expanded provisions on abortions  becoming the first federal entity to expand abortion in Mexico beyond cases of rape and economic reasons  to permit it regardless of the reason should the mother request it before the
