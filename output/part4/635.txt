Energy policy of the United States From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search The energy policy of the United States is determined by federal  state and local public entities in the United States  which address issues of energy production  distribution  and consumption  such as building codes and gas mileage standards  Energy policy may include legislation  international treaties  subsidies and incentives to investment  guidelines for energy conservation  taxation and other public policy techniques  Several mandates have been proposed over the years  such as gasoline will never exceed  1 00 gallon  Nixon   and the United States will never again import as much oil as it did in 1977  Carter   1  but no comprehensive long term energy policy has been proposed  although there has been concern over this failure  2  Three Energy Policy Acts have been passed  in 1992  2005  and 2007  3  which include many provisions for conservation  such as the Energy Star program  and energy development  with grants and tax incentives for both renewable energy and non renewable energy  State specific energy efficiency incentive programs also play a significant role in the overall energy policy of the United States  4  The United States had resisted endorsing the Kyoto Protocol  preferring to let the market drive CO2 reductions to mitigate global warming  which will require CO2 emission taxation  The administration of Barack Obama has proposed an aggressive energy policy reform  including the need for a reduction of CO2 emissions  with a cap and trade program  which could help encourage more clean renewable  sustainable energy development  5  Contents 1 History 2 Energy independence 3 Energy consumption 4 Sources 4 1 Petroleum 4 2 Coal 4 3 Natural gas 4 4

States In the Colonial era the energy policy of the United States was for free use of standing timber for heating and industry  In the 19th century  new emphasis was placed on access to coal and its use for transport  heating and industry  Whales were rendered into lamp oil  6  Later  coal gas was fractionated for use as lighting and town gas  Natural gas was first used in America for lighting in 1816   2   it has grown in importance for use in homes  industry  and power plants  but natural gas production reached its U S  peak in 1973   3  and the price has risen significantly since then  Coal provided the bulk of the US energy needs well into the 20th century  Most urban homes had a coal bin and a coal fired furnace  Over the years these were replaced with oil furnaces  not because of it being cheaper but because it was easier and safer  7  Coal remains far cheaper than oil  The biggest use of oil has come from the development of the automobile  US oil reserves increased until 1970  and then began to decline  By 1950  oil consumption exceeded that of coal  8  9  The abundance of oil in California  Texas  Oklahoma  as well as in Canada and Mexico  coupled with its low cost  ease of transportation  high energy density  and use in internal combustion engines  lead to its increasing use  Following World War II  oil heating boilers took over from coal burners along the Eastern Seaboard  diesel locomotives took over from coal fired steam engines under dieselisation  oil fired electricity plants were built  petroleum burning buses replaced electric streetcars in a GM driven conspiracy  for which they were found guilty  and citizens bought gasoline powered cars  Interstate Highways helped make cars the major means of personal transportation  10  As oil imports increased  US foreign policy was inexorably drawn into Middle East politics  supporting oil producing Saudi Arabia and patrolling the sea lanes of the Persian Gulf  11  Grand Coulee Dam Hydroelectricity was the basis of Nikola Tesla s introduction of the U S  electricity grid  starting at Niagara Falls  NY in 1883   4  Electricity generated by major dams like the Jensen Dam  TVA Project  Grand Coulee Dam and Hoover Dam still produce some of the lowest priced   0 08 kWh   clean electricity in America  Rural electrification strung power lines to many more areas  6  12  Utilities have their rates set to earn a revenue stream that provides them with a constant 10    13  rate of return based on operating costs  Increases or decreases of the operating costs of electricity production are passed directly through to the consumers  13  The federal government provided substantially larger subsidies to fossil fuels than to renewables in the 2002 2008 period  Subsidies to fossil fuels totaled approximately  72 billion over the study period  representing a direct cost to taxpayers  Subsidies for renewable fuels  totaled  29 billion over the same period  14  In some cases  the U S  has used its energy policy as a means to pursue other international goals  Richard Heinberg  a professor from Santa Rosa  California argues that a declassified CIA document shows that the U S  used oil prices as leverage against the economy of the Soviet Union  Specifically  he argues that the U S  intentionally worked with Saudi Arabia during the Reagan administration to keep oil prices low  thus decreasing the purchasing power of the Soviet Union s petroleum export industry  When combined with other U S  efforts to drain Soviet resources  this was eventually a major cause in the dissolution of the Soviet Union  15   edit  Energy independence See also  1973 oil crisis and U S  Energy Independence United States oil production peaked in 1970 and began to decline  By 2005 imports were about twice as great as production  The 1973 oil crisis made energy a popular topic of discussion in the US  16  The Federal Department of Energy was started with steps planned toward energy conservation and more modern energy producers  A National Maximum Speed Limit of 55 mph  88 km h  was imposed to help reduce consumption  and Corporate Average Fuel Economy  aka CAFE standards were enacted to downsize automobile categories  17  Year round Daylight Saving Time was imposed  the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve was created and the National Energy Act of 1978 was introduced  Alternate forms of energy and diversified oil supply resulted  18  The United States receives approximately 84  of its energy from fossil fuels  19  This energy is used for transport  industry  and domestic use  The remaining portion comes primarily from Hydro and Nuclear stations  20 Americans constitute less than 5  of the world s population  but consumes 26  of the world s energy 21  to produce 26  of the world s industrial output  They account for about 25  of the world s petroleum consumption  while producing only 6  of the world s annual petroleum supply 22  and having only 3  of the world s known oil reserves  23  In the United States  oil is primarily consumed as fuel for cars  buses  trucks and airplanes  in the form of gasoline  diesel and jet fuel   Two thirds of U S  oil consumption is in the transportation sector  24  The US   an important export country for food stocks   converted approximately 18  of its grain output to ethanol in 2008  Across the US  25  of the whole corn crop went to ethanol in 2007  25  The percentage of corn going to biofuel is expected to go up  26  In 2006  U S  Senators introduced the BioFuels Security Act  27  The proposal has been made for a hydrogen economy  where cars and factories are powered by fuel cells  although the hydrogen would still have to be produced at an energy cost  and hydrogen cars have been called one of the least efficient  most expensive ways to reduce greenhouse gases  28  29  Other plans include making society carbon neutral and using renewable energy  including solar  wind and methane sources  Automobiles  on the other hand  possibly could be powered 60  by grid electricity  20  by biofuels and 20  direct solar  Re design of cities  telecommuting  mass transit  higher housing density and walking could also reduce automobile fuel consumption and obesity  30  Carpooling  flexcars  Smart cars  and shorter commutes could all reduce fuel use  31  32  It should be noted that between 1950 and 1984  as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe  world grain production increased by 250   The energy for the Green Revolution was provided by fossil fuels in the form of fertilizers  natural gas   pesticides  oil   and hydrocarbon fueled irrigation  33  The peaking of world hydrocarbon production  Peak oil  may test Malthus  critics  34  Almost all of Canada s energy exports go to the United States  making it the largest foreign source of U S  energy imports  Canada is the top source of U S  oil imports  and it is the largest source of U S  natural gas and electricity imports  35   edit  Energy consumption US energy consumption by primary consuming sector Buildings and their construction consume more energy than transportation or industrial applications  and because buildings are responsible for the largest portion of greenhouse emissions  they have the largest impact on man made climate change  The AIA has proposed making buildings carbon neutral by 2030  meaning that the construction and operation of buildings will not require fossil fuel energy or emit greenhouse gases  and having the U S  reduce CO2 emissions to 40 to 60  below 1990 levels by 2050  36  When President Carter created the U S  Department of Energy in 1977  one of their first successful projects was the Weatherization Assistance Program  37  During the last 30 years  this program has provided services to more than 5 5 million low income families  On average  low cost weatherization reduces heating bills by 31  and overall energy bills by  358 per year at current prices  Increased energy efficiency and weatherization spending has a high return on investment  38  The  Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007  has a significant impact on U S  Energy Policy  It includes funding to help improve building codes  and will make it illegal to sell incandescent light bulbs  as they are less efficient than fluorescents and LEDs  3  Technologies such as passive solar building design and zero energy buildings  ZEB  have demonstrated significant new construction energy bill reductions  The  Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007  includes funding to increase the popularity of ZEBs  photovoltaics  and even a new solar air conditioning program  Many energy saving measures can be added to existing buildings as retrofits  but others are only cost effective in new construction  which is why building code improvements are being encouraged  The solution requires both improved incentives for energy conservation  and new energy sources  The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 increases average gas mileage to 35 mpg by 2020  The current administration and 2007 legislation are encouraging the near term use of plug in electric cars  and hydrogen cars by 2020  Toyota has suggested that their third generation 2009 Prius 39  may cost much less than the current model  40  Larger advanced technology batteries have been suggested to make it plug in rechargeable  Photovoltaics are an option being discussed to extend its daytime electric driving range  Improving solar cell efficiency factors will continue to make this a progressively more cost effective option   edit  Sources US energy consumption by primary source About 86  of all types of energy used in the United States is derived from fossil fuels  In 2007  the largest source of the country s energy came from petroleum  40    followed by natural gas  24   and coal  23    The remaining 15  was supplied by nuclear power  hydroelectric dams  and miscellaneous renewable sources  41   edit  Petroleum U S  Imports of Crude Oil and Petroleum Products  Thousand Barrels   1981 2010  The US consumes  in 2006  20 8 million barrels  3 310 000 m3  of petroleum a day  42  of which 9 million barrels  1 400 000 m3  is motor gasoline  Transportation has the highest consumption rates  accounting for approximately 68 9  of the oil used in the United States in 2006  43  and 55  of oil use worldwide as documented in the Hirsch report  With approximately 5  of the world s population  the United States is responsible for approximately 25  of annual global oil consumption and according to 2008 estimates has a per person daily consumption rate more than double that of the European Union  44  45 Automobiles are the single largest consumer of oil  46  consuming 40   and are also the source of 20  of the nation s greenhouse gas emissions  47  An offshore oil platform The USA has about 22 billion barrels  3 5 109 m3  reserves while consuming about 7 6 billion barrels  1 21 109 m3  per year  42  This has created pressure for additional drilling   Presidential Memorandum fuel economy  Memorandum fuel economy  lt  ref gt  European gasoline prices were artificially raised to  4 per gallon through taxation long before they reached  4 gallon in the U S   leading to better fuel economy  48  49  Problems associated with oil supply include volatile oil prices  increasing world and domestic petroleum product demand  dependence on unstable imported foreign oil  falling domestic production  peak oil   and declining infrastructure  like the Alaska pipeline and oil refineries  American dependence on imports grew from 10  in 1970 to 65  by the end of 2004  At the current rate of unchecked import growth  the US would be 70  to 75  reliant on foreign oil by the middle of the next decade  50  However  the Energy Information Administration projects that U S  oil imports will remain flat and consumption will grow  so net imports will decline to 54  of U S  oil consumption by 2030  51  According to US Energy Information Administration  in 2011  the top crude oil exporters to the United States were Canada  Saudi Arabia  Mexico  Venezuela and Nigeria  in order from most exports to least   52  The subject of continued exploration for offshore drilling in the United States is a perennial debate  one which was heavily influenced in 2010 by the BP Macondo oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico   edit  Coal Main article  Coal power in the United States US coal regions America is self sufficient in coal  53  Indeed  it has several hundred years supply of it  54  55  The United states trend in coal use has been rising for decades  From 1950 through 2006  both coal production and coal consumption in the United States have more than doubled  56  The population of the US has almost doubled in this time period as well  while the per capita energy use has been declining since 1978  57  58  Most electricity  52  in 2000  in the country is generated from coal fired power plants  6  in 2006  more than 90  of coal consumed was used to generate electricity  In 1950  about 19  percent of the coal consumed was for electricity generation  59  Coal in transit in Ohio In terms of the production of energy from domestic sources  from 1885 through 1951  coal was the leading source of energy in the United States  Crude oil and natural gas then vied for that role until 1982  Coal regained the position of the top domestic resource that year and again in 1984  and has retained it since  60  The US burns 1 billion tons of coal every year  Concern for climate change has led to a call for a moratorium on all coal consumption  unless carbon capture is utilized  Coal is the largest potential source of CO2 emissions  61  62  63  Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle  IGCC  is the cleanest currently operational coal fired electricity generation technology  FutureGen is an experimental U S  research project to investigate the possibility of sequestering IGCC CO2 emissions underground   edit  Natural gas See also  Shale gas in the United States Natural gas production and consumption quadrupled between 1950 and 1970 to 20 10 12 cu ft  570 km3   but declined steadily to stabilize in 1986  Since then  the United States imports a rising share of its gas  In 2008 consumption of natural gas stood at 23 2 10 12 cu ft  660 km3   while domestic production was at 20 6 10 12 cu ft  580 km3   Approximately 3 0 10 12 cu ft  85 km3  were imported  mainly by pipelines from Canada  which accounted for 90  of foreign supplies  while the remainder is delivered by liquefied natural gas  LNG  tankers carrying gas from five different countries  64  The largest gas producing states in 2007 were Texas  30    Wyoming  10    Oklahoma  9   and New Mexico  8    while 14  of the country s production came from the federal offshore lands in the Gulf of Mexico  64  Recent development in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have increased interest for shale gas across the United States in recent years  Leading fields are the Barnett Shale in Texas and the Antrim Shale in Michigan  Natural gas reserves in the United States were 35  higher in 2008 than two years earlier largely due to shale gas discoveries  65   edit  Nuclear power Main article  Nuclear power in the United States NRC regions and locations of nuclear reactors  2008 As of 2008  nuclear power in the United States is provided by 104 commercial reactors  69 pressurized water reactors and 35 boiling water reactors  licensed to operate at 65 nuclear power plants  producing a total of 806 2 TWh of electricity  which was 19 6  of the nation s total electric energy generation in 2008  66  The United States is the world s largest supplier of commercial nuclear power  As of 2010  the demand for nuclear power is softening in America  and some companies have withdrawn their applications for licenses to build  67  68  Ground has been broken on two new nuclear plants with a total of four reactors  The only reactor currently under construction in America  at Watts Bar  Tennessee  was begun in 1973 and may be completed in 2012  Of the 104 reactors now operating in the U S   ground was broken on all of them in 1974 or earlier  67  68  In September 2010  Matthew Wald from the New York Times reported that  the nuclear renaissance is looking small and slow at the moment   69  Following the 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents  the U S  Nuclear Regulatory Commission has announced it will launch a comprehensive safety review of the 104 nuclear power reactors across the United States  at the request of President Obama  The Obama administration  continues to support the expansion of nuclear power in the United States  despite the crisis in Japan   70  Following the Japanese nuclear emergency  public support for building nuclear power plants in the U S  dropped to 43   slightly lower than it was immediately after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979  according to a CBS News poll  71   edit  Renewable energy Main article  Renewable energy in the United States Renewable energy accounted for about 8  of total energy consumption in the United States in 2009  In the same year  approximately 10  of the electricity produced nationally came from renewable sources  72  The United States  hydroelectric plants make the largest contribution to the country s renewable energy  producing 248 100MW of the 371 700MW  67   generated through all renewable energy  73  74  However  wind power in the United States is a growing industry  Increases in wind  solar  and geothermal power are expected to allow renewable energy production to double in the three year period from 2009 to 2012  an increase from 8  to 14  of total consumption  Most of the increase is expected to come from wind power  75  Brazos Wind Ranch in Texas  As of the third quarter of 2011  the cumulative installed capacity of wind power in the United States was 43 461 megawatts  MW   76  making it second in the world behind China  In 2010 Wind power accounted for 2 3  of the electricity generated in the United States  77  This amounted to 94 650 thousand megawatt hours of electricity  78  Driven by state renewable energy targets  fourteen states have installed over 1 000 MW of wind capacity  and a total of 37 states now have installed at least some utility scale wind power  79 Texas  with 9 728 MW of capacity  has the most installed wind power capacity of any U S  state  followed by Iowa with 3 670 MW  80  The Roscoe Wind Farm  780 MW  in Texas is the largest wind farm in the US as of 2009  81  Several solar thermal power stations  including the new 64 MW Nevada Solar One  have also been built  Solar Energy Generating Systems  SEGS  is the name given to nine solar power plants in the Mojave Desert  which were commissioned between 1984 and 1991  82  The SEGS installation uses parabolic trough solar thermal technology along with natural gas to generate electricity  The plants have a total generating capacity of 354 MW  making the system the largest solar plant of any kind in the world  82  The Ivanpah Solar Power Facility is a 392 MW solar thermal power facility which is under construction in south eastern California  83  The Solana Generating Station is a 280 MW solar power plant which is under construction about 70 miles  110 km  southwest of Phoenix  Arizona  The Mojave Solar Park is a 280 MW solar thermal power facility under construction in the Mojave Desert in California  which should be completed in 2014  84  There are plans to build many other large solar thermal plants in the United States  Photovoltaic  PV  cells convert sunlight directly into electricity and are made of semiconductors such as crystalline silicon or various thin film materials  85  The Copper Mountain Solar Facility is a 48 MW solar PV power plant in Boulder City  Nevada  The DeSoto Next Generation Solar Energy Center is a 25 MW photovoltaic solar power facility in Arcadia  DeSoto County  Florida  The 21 megawatt Blythe Photovoltaic Power Plant is the largest PV solar project in California  The 14 MW Nellis Solar Power Plant is located within Nellis Air Force Base in Clark County  Nevada  There are also many large plants under construction  The Desert Sunlight Project is a 550 MW solar power plant under construction in Riverside County  California  that will use thin film solar photovoltaic modules made by First Solar  86  The Topaz Solar Farm is a 550 MW photovoltaic power plant  being built in San Luis Obispo County  California  87  The Blythe Solar Power Project is a 500 MW photovoltaic station under construction in Riverside County  California  The Agua Caliente Solar Project is a 290 megawatt photovoltaic solar generating facility being built in Yuma County  Arizona  The California Valley Solar Ranch  CVSR  is a 250 megawatt  MW  solar photovoltaic power plant  which is being built by SunPower in the Carrizo Plain  northeast of California Valley  88  The 230 MW Antelope Valley Solar Ranch is a First Solar photovoltaic project which is under construction in the Antelope Valley area of the Western Mojave Desert  and due to be completed in 2013  89  With 2 957 MW of installed geothermal capacity  the United States remains the world leader with 30  of the online capacity total  As of early 2009  120 new projects are underway  90  When developed  these projects could potentially supply up to 3 979 MW of power  meeting the needs of about 4 million homes  At this rate of development  geothermal production in the United States could exceed 15 000 MW by 2025  91  President Barack Obama s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included more than  70 billion in direct spending and tax credits for clean energy and associated transportation programs  This policy stimulus combination represents the largest federal commitment in U S  history for renewable energy  advanced transportation  and energy conservation initiatives  As a result of these new initiatives  many more utilities are expected to strengthen their clean energy programs  92  In February 2011  the U S  Department of Energy launched its SunShot Initiative  a collaborative national effort to cut the total cost of photovoltaic solar energy systems by 75  by 2020  93  Reaching this goal would make unsubsidized solar energy cost competitive with other forms of electricity  94   edit  Biofuels Main articles  Biofuel in the United States  Food vs fuel  and Sustainable biofuels In recent years there has been an increased interest in biofuels   bioethanol and biodiesel   derived from common agricultural staples or waste  Increased domestic production of these fuels could reduce US expenditure on foreign oil and improve energy security if methods of producing and transporting the fuels do not involve heavy inputs of fossil fuels  as current agriculture does  Most cars on the road today in the U S  can run on blends of up to 10  ethanol  and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends  Portland  Oregon  recently became the first city in the United States to require all gasoline sold within city limits to contain at least 10  ethanol  95 Ford  DaimlerChrysler  and GM are among the automobile companies that sell  flexible fuel  cars  trucks  and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85  ethanol  E85   By mid 2006  there were approximately 6 million E85 compatible vehicles on U S  roads  96  The Renewable Fuels Association counts 113 U S  ethanol distilleries in operation and another 78 under construction  with capacity to produce 11 8 billion gallons within the next few years  The Energy Information Administration  EIA  predicts in its Annual Energy Outlook 2007 that ethanol consumption will reach 11 2 billion US gallons  42 000 000 m3  by 2012  outstripping the 7 5 billion US gallons  28 000 000 m3  required in the Renewable Fuel Standard that was enacted as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005  97  Expanding ethanol fuel  and biodiesel  industries provide jobs in plant construction  operations  and maintenance  mostly in rural communities  According to the Renewable Fuels Association  the ethanol industry created almost 154 000 U S  jobs in 2005 alone  boosting household income by  5 7 billion  It also contributed about  3 5 billion in tax revenues at the local  state  and federal levels  96  In recent years  there has been criticism about the production of ethanol fuel from food crops  98  99  100  However  second generation biofuels are now being produced from a much broader range of feedstocks including the cellulose in dedicated energy crops  perennial grasses such as switchgrass and Miscanthus giganteus   forestry materials  the co products from food production  and domestic vegetable waste  101  Produced responsibly they are sustainable energy sources that need not divert any land from growing food  nor damage the environment  102  103   edit  Energy efficiency Main article  Efficient energy use A spiral type integrated compact fluorescent lamp  which has been popular among North American consumers since its introduction in the mid 1990s  104  The Tesla Roadster  first delivered in 2008  uses Li Ion batteries to achieve 220 miles per charge  while also capable of going 0 60 in under 4 seconds  There are many different types of energy efficiency innovations and these include  efficient water heaters  improved refrigerators and freezers  advanced building control technologies and advances in heating  ventilation  and cooling  HVAC   smart windows that adapt to maintain a comfortable interior environment  a steady stream of new building codes to reduce needless energy use  and compact fluorescent lights  Improvements in buildings alone  where over sixty percent of all energy is used  save tens of billions of dollars per year  105  Several states  including California  New York  Rhode Island  and Wisconsin  have consistently deployed energy efficiency innovations  Their state planners officials  citizens  and industry leaders  have found these to be very cost effective  often providing greater service at lower personal and social cost than simply adding more fossil fuel based supply technologies  This is the case for several reasons  Energy efficient technologies often represent upgrades in service through superior performance  e g  higher quality lighting  heating and cooling with greater controls  or improved reliability of service through greater ability of utilities to respond to time of peak demand   So these innovations can provide a better  less expensive  service  105  A wide range of energy efficient technologies have ancillary benefits of improved quality of life  such as advanced windows that not only save on heating and cooling expenses  but also make the work place or home more comfortable  Another example is more efficient vehicles  which not only save immediately on fuel purchases  but also emit less pollutants  improving health and saving on medical costs to the individual and to society  105   edit  Energy efficiency action plans In March 2009  Vice President Joe Biden announced plans to invest  3 2 billion in energy efficiency and energy conservation projects in the United States  The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants program  funded by President Obama s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act  will provide grants for projects that reduce total energy use and fossil fuel emissions  and improve energy efficiency nationwide  106  DOE and the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  have released an updated version of the National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency  Vision for 2025  A Framework for Change   which lays out a proposed energy efficiency action plan for state policy makers  If implemented by all states  the plan could lower energy demand across the country by 50   achieve more than  500 billion in net savings over the next 20 years  and reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to those from 90 million vehicles  The report  which was released under the National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency initiative  was produced by more than 60 energy  environmental  and state policy leaders from across the country  The updated action plan encourages investment in low cost energy efficiency programs and shows the progress that the states are making toward their goals  while identifying areas for additional progress  The report is accompanied by two technical assistance documents that offer cost effectiveness tests for energy efficiency programs and best practices for providing data to businesses  107   edit  Energy budget  initiatives and incentives Main article  List of United States Energy Acts An incentive resulting from US energy policy is a factor that provides motive for a specific course of action regarding the use of energy  In the U S  most energy policy incentives take the form of financial incentives  Examples of these include tax breaks  tax reductions  tax exemptions  rebates  loans and specific funding  Throughout US history there have been many incentives created through U S  energy policy  Most recently the Energy Policy Act of 2005  Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007  and Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008  each promote various energy efficiency improvements and encourage development of specific energy sources  U S  Energy policy incentives can serve as a strategic manner to develop certain industries that plan to reduce America s dependence on foreign petroleum products and create jobs and industries that boost the national economy  The ability to do this depends upon which industries and products the government chooses to subsidize   edit  Budget Further information  USDOE The 2012 budget that President Obama submitted to Congress calls for a 70 percent increase over the 2011 allocation for federal research and development activities related to renewable energy  The Office of Science in the Department of Energy would receive  2 0 billion for basic energy sciences to discover new ways to produce  store and use energy  Included in that amount are allocations of  457 million for solar energy   341 million for biofuels and biomass R amp D  including a new reverse auction to promote advanced biofuels  and more than doubling investment in geothermal energy to  102 million  The budget includes funding to accelerate the deployment of new models of energy research pioneered in the last several years  including  550 million for the Advanced Research Projects Agency Energy  a program that supports breakthrough ideas  108   edit  Public investment Public investment can enable the development of infrastructure projects through the use of public funds  grants  loans or other financing options  These funds provide a means for allocating the capital necessary for the development of renewable energy technologies   edit  Tax incentives Federal tax incentives can be designed to accelerate market adoption  create jobs  encourage investment in a public good  reduced pollution  or encourage investment in renewable technology research and development  The Production Tax Credit  PTC  reduces the federal income taxes of qualified tax paying owners of renewable energy projects based on the electrical output  measured in kWh  of grid connected renewable energy facilities  The Investment Tax Credit  ITC  reduces federal income taxes for qualified tax paying owners based on dollars of capital investment in renewable energy projects  The Advanced Energy Manufacturing Tax Credit  MTC  awards tax credits to new  expanded  or re equipped domestic manufacturing facilities that support clean energy development  109   edit  Loan guarantees The Department of Energy s Loan Guarantee Program  established by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and enhanced by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009  attempts to pave the way for investor support of clean energy projects by providing a guarantee of financing up to 80  of the project cost  The program is scheduled to end on September 30  2011  unless Congress passes further legislation  110   edit  Renewable portfolio standard A Renewable Portfolio Standard  RPS  is a mandate that requires electricity providers to supply to their customers a minimum amount of power from renewable sources  usually as a percentage of total energy use  As of June 2010  such standards have been enacted in 31 U S  states and the District of Columbia  111  For example  Governor Jerry Brown signed legislation requiring California s utilities to get 33 percent of their electricity from renewable energy sources by the end of 2020  112  Congress has considered a national RPS since 1997  the Senate has passed legislation three times  and the House once  113  As of April 2011  both houses have not acted in unison to pass legislation   edit  Biofuel subsidies In the United States biofuel subsidies have been justified on the following grounds  energy independence  reduction in greenhouse gas emissions  improvements in rural development related to biofuel plants and farm income support  Several economists from Iowa State University found   there is no evidence to disprove that the primary objective of biofuel policy is to support farm income   114   edit  Consumer subsidies Consumers who purchase hybrid vehicles are eligible for a tax credit that depends upon the type of vehicle and the difference in fuel economy in comparison to vehicles of similar weights  These credits range from several hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars  115  Homeowners can receive a tax credit up to  500 for energy efficient products like insulation  windows  doors  as well as heating and cooling equipment  Homeowners who install solar electric systems can receive a 30  tax credit and homeowners who install small wind systems can receive a tax credit up to  4000  Geothermal heat pumps also qualify for tax credits up to  2 000  116   edit  Other subsidies Recent energy policy incentives have provided  among other things  billions of dollars in tax reductions for nuclear power  fossil fuel production  clean coal technologies renewable electricity production  and conservation and efficiency improvements  117   edit  Greenhouse Gas Emissions See also  Greenhouse gas emissions by the United States and Kyoto Protocol CO2 emission per capita per year per country Although exceeded by China  118  the United States has historically been the world s largest producer of greenhouse gases  119  Some states  however  are much more prolific polluters than others  The state of Texas produces approximately 1 5 trillion pounds of carbon dioxide yearly  more than every nation in the world except five  and the United States   China  Russia  Japan  India  and Germany  120  Despite signing the Kyoto Protocol  the United States has neither ratified nor withdrawn from it  In the absence of ratification it remains non binding on the US  Many cities  however  have adopted Kyoto  As of March 11  2007  418 US cities in 50 states  representing more than 60 million Americans adopted Kyoto after Mayor Greg Nickels of Seattle started a nationwide effort to get cities to agree to the protocol  121  The Obama Administration has promised to take specific action towards mitigation of climate change  In addition  at state and local levels  there are currently a number of initiatives  As of January 18  2007  eight Northeastern US states are involved in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative  RGGI   122  a state level emissions capping and trading program  On August 31  2006  the California Legislature reached an agreement with Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to reduce the state s greenhouse gas emissions  which rank at 12th largest carbon emitter in the world  123  by 25 percent by the year 2020  This resulted in the Global Warming Solutions Act which effectively puts California in line with the Kyoto limitations  but at a date later than the 2008 2012 Kyoto commitment period  In the non binding  Washington Declaration  agreed on February 16  2007  the United States  together with Presidents or Prime Ministers from Canada  France  Germany  Italy  Japan  Russia  United Kingdom  Brazil  China  India  Mexico and South Africa agreed in principle on the outline of a successor to the Kyoto Protocol  They envisage a global cap and trade system that would apply to both industrialized nations and developing countries  and hoped that this would be in place by 2009  124  125  Chemistry Professor Nathan Lewis at Caltech estimates that to keep atmospheric carbon levels below 750 ppm  a level at which serious climate change would occur  by the year 2050  the United States would need to generate twice as much energy from renewable sources as is generated by all power sources combined today  126  However  current research indicates that even carbon dioxide concentrations in excess of 450 ppm would result in irreversible global climate change  127  The book  Carbon Free and Nuclear Free  A Roadmap for U S  Energy Policy  128  by Arjun Makhijani  argues that in order to meet goals of limiting global warming to 2  C  the world will need to reduce CO2 emissions by 85  and the U S  will need to reduce emissions by 95   which can be extended to within a few percent plus or minus of carbon free with little additional change  129  The book calls for phasing out use of oil  natural gas  and coal which does not use carbon sequestration by the year 2050  130  Effective delivered energy is projected to increase from about 75 Quadrillion Btu in 2005 to about 125 Quadrillion in 2050  131  but due to efficiency increases  the actual energy input is projected to increase from about 99 Quadrillion Btu in 2005 to about 103 Quadrillion in 2010 and then to decrease to about 77 Quadrillion in 2050  132  Petroleum use is projected to increase until 2010 and then linearly decrease to zero by 2050  The roadmap calls for nuclear power to decrease to zero at the same time  with the reduction also beginning in 2010  133  In his book Hell and High Water  author Joseph Romm calls for the rapid deployment of existing technologies to decrease carbon emissions  In a follow up article in Nature com in June 2008  he argues that  If we are to have confidence in our ability to stabilize carbon dioxide levels below 450 p p m  emissions must average less than  5 billion metric tons of carbon  per year over the century  This means accelerating the deployment of the 11 wedges so they begin to take effect in 2015 and are completely operational in much less time than originally modelled by Socolow and Pacala   134  Texas Billionaire T  Boone Pickens has promoted the Pickens Plan with a television advertisement campaign questioning the current state of energy in the US  He is an advocate of renewable energy sources and proposed building a 4000 MW wind farm in the state of Texas  Even Indiana  estimated to have a potential for developing only 30 MW of wind power in 1991 using 50 m high wind turbines  was in 2006 estimated as having the potential for 40 000 MW of wind power  using higher  70 m turbines  and possibly twice that with modern 100 m high turbines  135   edit  Distribution Main articles  Electricity distribution and V2G Long distance electric power transmission results in energy loss  through electrical resistance  heat generation  electromagnetic induction and less than perfect electrical insulation  136  In 1995  these losses were estimated at 7 2   137  Energy generation and distribution can be more efficient the closer it is to the point of use  if conducted in a high efficiency generator  such as a CHP  In the generation and delivery of electrical power  system losses along the delivery chain are pronounced  Of five units of energy going into most large power plants  only about one unit of energy is delivered to the consumer in a usable form  138  A similar situation exists in gas transport  where compressor stations along pipelines use energy to keep the gas moving  or where gas liquefaction cooling regasification in the liquiefied natural gas supply chain uses a substantial amount of energy  even though the scale of the loss is not as pronounced as it is in electricity  Distributed generation is a means of reducing total and transmission losses   edit  Statistics Electricity  US Energy Use  Quad BTU

June 5  2007 revealed that  144  74  are concerned about climate change  80  think their Government should do more to tackle global warming  84  think that the US is too dependent on fossil fuels  72  think that the US is too reliant on foreign oil  79  think that the US Government should do more to increase the number of hybrid cars that are sold  67  think that the US Government should allow more off shore drilling  An April CBS News New York Times poll collected a wide range of data that demonstrates the public s desire for serious action on global warming  By an almost two to one margin  63 percent to 32 percent   the public endorses the idea that protecting the environment is so important that  requirements and standards cannot be too high  and that  continuing environmental improvements must be made regardless of cost   The public is also quite clear on its priorities when it comes to promoting energy conservation versus increasing the supply of oil  coal  and natural gas  When asked which of these should be the higher priority  the public chooses energy conservation by a very wide 68 percent to 21 percent margin  145  The public also predominantly believes that the need to cut down on energy consumption and protect the environment means increased energy efficiency should be mandated for certain products  Ninety two percent of Americans now support such requirements  146   edit  General legislative policy  legislation and plans The Obama administration includes Dr  Steven Chu  to head the U S  Department of Energy  As of February  2008  the goals
