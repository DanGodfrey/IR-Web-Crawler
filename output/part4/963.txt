Computer science From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search Computer science or computing science  abbreviated CS or CompSci  designates the scientific and mathematical approach in computing  1  2  A computer scientist is a person who does work at a professional level in computer science and or has attained a degree in computer science or a related field  Its subfields can be divided into practical techniques for its implementation and application in computer systems and purely theoretical areas  Some  such as computational complexity theory  which studies fundamental properties of computational problems  are highly abstract  while others  such as computer graphics  emphasize real world applications  Still others focus on the challenges in implementing computations  For example  programming language theory studies approaches to description of computations  while the study of computer programming itself investigates various aspects of the use of programming languages and complex systems  and human computer interaction focuses on the challenges in making computers and computations useful  usable  and universally accessible to humans  Computer science deals with the theoretical foundations of information  computation  and with practical techniques for their implementation and application  Contents 1 History 1 1 Major achievements 2 Philosophy 2 1

earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern digital computer  Machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the abacus have existed since antiquity  Wilhelm Schickard designed the first mechanical calculator in 1623  but did not complete its construction  3 Blaise Pascal designed and constructed the first working mechanical calculator  the Pascaline  in 1642  Charles Babbage designed a difference engine and then a general purpose Analytical Engine in Victorian times  4  for which Ada Lovelace wrote a manual  Because of this work she is regarded today as the world s first programmer  5  Around 1900  punched card machines were introduced  During the 1940s  as newer and more powerful computing machines were developed  the term computer came to refer to the machines rather than their human predecessors  6  As it became clear that computers could be used for more than just mathematical calculations  the field of computer science broadened to study computation in general  Computer science began to be established as a distinct academic discipline in the 1950s and early 1960s  7  8  The world s first computer science degree program  the Cambridge Diploma in Computer Science  began at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory in 1953  The first computer science degree program in the United States was formed at Purdue University in 1962  9  Since practical computers became available  many applications of computing have become distinct areas of study in their own right  Although many initially believed it was impossible that computers themselves could actually be a scientific field of study  in the late fifties it gradually became accepted among the greater academic population  10  It is the now well known IBM brand that formed part of the computer science revolution during this time  IBM  short for International Business Machines  released the IBM 704 and later the IBM 709 computers  which were widely used during the exploration period of such devices   Still  working with the IBM  computer  was frustrating   if you had misplaced as much as one letter in one instruction  the program would crash  and you would have to start the whole process over again   10  During the late 1950s  the computer science discipline was very much in its developmental stages  and such issues were commonplace  Time has seen significant improvements in the usability and effectiveness of computer science technology  Modern society has seen a significant shift from computers being used solely by experts or professionals to a more widespread user base  Initially  computers were quite costly  and for their most effective use  some degree of human aid was needed  in part by professional computer operators  However  as computers became widespread and far more affordable  less human assistance was needed  although residues of the original assistance still remained   edit  Major achievements The German military used the Enigma machine  shown here  during World War II for communication they thought to be secret  The large scale decryption of Enigma traffic at Bletchley Park was an important factor that contributed to Allied victory in WWII  11  Despite its short history as a formal academic discipline  computer science has made a number of fundamental contributions to science and society  These include  The start of the  digital revolution   which includes the current Information Age and the Internet  12  A formal definition of computation and computability  and proof that there are computationally unsolvable and intractable problems  13  The concept of a programming language  a tool for the precise expression of methodological information at various levels of abstraction  14  In cryptography  breaking the Enigma machine was an important factor contributing to the Allied victory in World War II  11  Scientific computing enabled practical evaluation of processes and situations of great complexity  as well as experimentation entirely by software  It also enabled advanced study of the mind  and mapping of the human genome became possible with the Human Genome Project  12 Distributed computing projects such as Folding home explore protein folding  Algorithmic trading has increased the efficiency and liquidity of financial markets by using artificial intelligence  machine learning  and other statistical and numerical techniques on a large scale  15  High frequency algorithmic trading can also exacerbate volatility  16  Image synthesis  including video by computing individual video frames  citation needed  Simulation of various processes  including computational fluid dynamics  physical  electrical  and electronic systems and circuits  as well as societies and social situations  notably war games  along with their habitats  among many others  Modern computers enable optimization of such designs as complete aircraft  Notable in electrical and electronic circuit design are SPICE as well as software for physical realization of new  or modified  designs  The latter includes essential design software for integrated circuits  citation needed   edit  Philosophy Main article  Philosophy of computer science A number of computer scientists have argued for the distinction of three separate paradigms in computer science  Peter Wegner argued that those paradigms are science  technology  and mathematics  17 Peter Denning s working group argued that they are theory  abstraction  modeling   and design  18  Amnon H  Eden described them as the  rationalist paradigm   which treats computer science as branch of mathematics  which is prevalent in theoretical computer science  and mainly employs deductive reasoning   the  technocratic paradigm   which might be found in engineering approaches  most prominently in software engineering   and the  scientific paradigm   which approaches computer related artifacts from the empirical perspective of natural sciences  identifiable in some branches of artificial intelligence   19   edit  Name of the field The term  computer science  was first coined by the numerical analyst George Forsythe in 1961  20  Despite its name  a significant amount of computer science does not involve the study of computers themselves  Because of this  several alternative names have been proposed  Certain departments of major universities prefer the term computing science  to emphasize precisely that difference  Danish scientist Peter Naur suggested the term datalogy  to reflect the fact that the scientific discipline revolves around data and data treatment  while not necessarily involving computers  The first scientific institution to use the term was the Department of Datalogy at the University of Copenhagen  founded in 1969  with Peter Naur being the first professor in datalogy  The term is used mainly in the Scandinavian countries  Also  in the early days of computing  a number of terms for the practitioners of the field of computing were suggested in the Communications of the ACM   turingineer  turologist  flow charts man  applied meta mathematician  and applied epistemologist  21  Three months later in the same journal  comptologist was suggested  followed next year by hypologist  22  The term computics has also been suggested  23  In Europe  terms derived from  information  are often used  e g  informatique  French   Informatik  German   informatica  Italy   inform tica  Spain  Portugal  or informatika  Slavic languages  are also used and have also been adopted in the UK  as in the School of Informatics of the University of Edinburgh   24  Renowned computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra once stated   Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes   25  The design and deployment of computers and computer systems is generally considered the province of disciplines other than computer science  For example  the study of computer hardware is usually considered part of computer engineering  while the study of commercial computer systems and their deployment is often called information technology or information systems  However  there has been much cross fertilization of ideas between the various computer related disciplines  Computer science research also often intersects other disciplines  such as philosophy  cognitive science  linguistics  mathematics  physics  statistics  and logic  Computer science is considered by some to have a much closer relationship with mathematics than many scientific disciplines  with some observers saying that computing is a mathematical science  7  Early computer science was strongly influenced by the work of mathematicians such as Kurt G del and Alan Turing  and there continues to be a useful interchange of ideas between the two fields in areas such as mathematical logic  category theory  domain theory  and algebra  The relationship between computer science and software engineering is a contentious issue  which is further muddied by disputes over what the term  software engineering  means  and how computer science is defined  David Parnas  taking a cue from the relationship between other engineering and science disciplines  has claimed that the principal focus of computer science is studying the properties of computation in general  while the principal focus of software engineering is the design of specific computations to achieve practical goals  making the two separate but complementary disciplines  26  The academic  political  and funding aspects of computer science tend to depend on whether a department formed with a mathematical emphasis or with an engineering emphasis  Computer science departments with a mathematics emphasis and with a numerical orientation consider alignment with computational science  Both types of departments tend to make efforts to bridge the field educationally if not across all research   edit  Areas of computer science As a discipline  computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms and the limits of computation to the practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware and software  27  28 CSAB  formerly called Computing Sciences Accreditation Board   which is made up of representatives of the Association for Computing Machinery  ACM   and the IEEE Computer Society  IEEE CS  29    identifies four areas that it considers crucial to the discipline of computer science  theory of computation  algorithms and data structures  programming methodology and languages  and computer elements and architecture  In addition to these four areas  CSAB also identifies fields such as software engineering  artificial intelligence  computer networking and communication  database systems  parallel computation  distributed computation  computer human interaction  computer graphics  operating systems  and numerical and symbolic computation as being important areas of computer science  27   edit  Theoretical computer science Main article  Theoretical computer science The broader field of theoretical computer science encompasses both the classical theory of computation and a wide range of other topics that focus on the more abstract  logical  and mathematical aspects of computing   edit  Theory of computation Main article  Theory of computation According to Peter J  Denning  the fundamental question underlying computer science is   What can be  efficiently  automated   7  The study of the theory of computation is focused on answering fundamental questions about what can be computed and what amount of resources are required to perform those computations  In an effort to answer the first question  computability theory examines which computational problems are solvable on various theoretical models of computation  The second question is addressed by computational complexity theory  which studies the time and space costs associated with different approaches to solving a multitude of computational problems  The famous  P NP   problem  one of the Millennium Prize Problems  30  is an open problem in the theory of computation  P   NP   GNITIRW TERCES Automata theory Computability theory Computational complexity theory Cryptography Quantum computing theory  edit  Information and coding theory Main articles  Information theory and Coding theory Information theory is related to the quantification of information This was developed by Claude E  Shannon to find fundamental limits on signal processing operations such as compressing data and on reliably storing and communicating data  Coding theory is the study of the properties of codes  systems for converting information from one form to another  and their fitness for a specific application  Codes are used for data compression  cryptography  error detection and correction  and more recently also for network coding  Codes are studied for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable data transmission methods   edit  Algorithms and data structures Analysis of algorithms Algorithms Data structures Computational geometry  edit  Programming language theory Main article  Programming language theory Programming language theory  PLT  is a branch of computer science that deals with the design  implementation  analysis  characterization  and classification of programming languages and their individual features  It falls within the discipline of computer science  both depending on and affecting mathematics  software engineering and linguistics  It is an active research area  with numerous dedicated academic journals  Type theory Compiler design Programming languages  edit  Formal methods Main article  Formal methods Formal methods are a particular kind of mathematically based technique for the specification  development and verification of software and hardware systems  The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that  as in other engineering disciplines  performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design  However  the high cost of using formal methods means that they are usually only used in the development of high integrity and life critical systems  where safety or security is of utmost importance  Formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of theoretical computer science fundamentals  in particular logic calculi  formal languages  automata theory  and program semantics  but also type systems and algebraic data types to problems in software and hardware specification and verification   edit  Concurrent  parallel and distributed systems Main articles  Concurrency  computer science  and Distributed computing Concurrency is a property of systems in which several computations are executing simultaneously  and potentially interacting with each other  A number of mathematical models have been developed for general concurrent computation including Petri nets  process calculi and the Parallel Random Access Machine model  A distributed system extends the idea of concurrency onto multiple computers connected through a network  Computers within the same distributed system have their own private memory  and information is often exchanged amongst themselves to achieve a common goal   edit  Databases and information retrieval Main articles  Database and Database management systems A database is intended to organize  store  and retrieve large amounts of data easily  Digital databases are managed using database management systems to store  create  maintain  and search data  through database models and query languages   edit  Applied computer science  edit  Artificial intelligence Main article  Artificial intelligence This branch of computer science aims to synthesise goal orientated processes such as problem solving  decision making  environmental adaptation  learning and communication which are found in humans and animals  From its origins in cybernetics and in the Dartmouth Conference  1956   artificial intelligence  AI  research has been necessarily cross disciplinary  drawing on areas of expertise such as applied mathematics  symbolic logic  semiotics  electrical engineering  philosophy of mind  neurophysiology  and social intelligence  AI is associated in the popular mind with robotic development  but the main field of practical application has been as an embedded component in areas of software development which require computational understanding and modeling such as finance and economics  data mining and the physical sciences  The starting point in the late 1940s was Alan Turing s question  Can computers think    and the question remains effectively unanswered although the  Turing Test  is still used to assess computer output on the scale of human intelligence  But the automation of evaluative and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful as a substitute for human monitoring and intervention in domains of computer application involving complex real world data  Machine Learning Computer vision Image Processing Pattern Recognition Cognitive Science Data Mining Evolutionary Computation Information Retrieval Knowledge Representation Natural Language Processing Robotics  edit  Computer architecture and engineering Main articles  Computer architecture and Computer engineering Computer architecture  or digital computer organization  is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system  It focuses largely on the way by which the central processing unit performs internally and accesses addresses in memory  The field often involves disciplines of computer engineering and electrical engineering  selecting and interconnection hardware components to create computers that meet functional  performance  and cost goals  Digital logic Microarchitecture Multiprocessing Operating systems Computer networks Databases Computer security Ubiquitous computing Systems architecture Compiler design Programming languages  edit  Computer graphics and visualization Main article  Computer graphics  computer science  Computer graphics is the study of digital visual contents  and involves syntheses and manipulations of image data  The study is connected to many other fields in computer science  including computer vision  image processing  and computational geometry  and are heavily applied in the fields of special effects and video games   edit  Computer security and cryptography Main articles  Computer security and Cryptography Computer security is a branch of computer technology  whose objective includes protection of information from unauthorized access  disruption  or modification while maintaining the accessibility and usability of the system for its intended users  Cryptography is the practice and study of hiding  encryption  and therefore deciphering  decryption  information  Modern cryptography is largely related to computer science  for many encryption and decryption algorithms are based on their computational complexity   edit  Computational science Computational science  or scientific computing  is the field of study concerned with constructing mathematical models and quantitative analysis techniques and using computers to analyze and solve scientific problems  In practical use  it is typically the application of computer simulation and other forms of computation to problems in various scientific disciplines  Numerical analysis Computational physics Computational chemistry Bioinformatics  edit  Health Informatics Main article  Health Informatics Health Informatics in computer science is referred to as Computational health informatics and deals with computational techniques for solving problems in health care  It is a sub branch of both computer science and health informatics   edit  Information science Main article  Information science Information Retrieval Knowledge Representation Natural Language Processing Human computer interaction  edit  Software engineering Main article  Software engineering Software engineering is the study of designing  implementing  and modifying software in order to ensure it is of high quality  affordable  maintainable  and fast to build  It is a systematic approach to software design  involving the application of engineering practices to software  Software engineering deals with the organizing and analyzing software to get the best out of them  It doesn t just deal with the creation or manufacture of new software  but its internal maintenance and arrangement   edit  Academia  edit  Conferences Further information  List of computer science conferences This section requires expansion   edit  Journals Further information  Category Computer science journals This section requires expansion   edit  Education Some universities teach computer science as a theoretical study of computation and algorithmic reasoning  These programs often feature the theory of computation  analysis of algorithms  formal methods  concurrency theory  databases  computer graphics  and systems analysis  among others  They typically also teach computer programming  but treat it as a vessel for the support of other fields of computer science rather than a central focus of high level study  Other colleges and universities  as well as secondary schools and vocational programs that teach computer science  emphasize the practice of advanced programming rather than the theory of algorithms and computation in their computer science curricula  Such curricula tend to focus on those skills that are important to workers entering the software industry  The process aspects of computer programming are often referred to as software engineering  While computer science professions increasingly drive the U S  economy  computer science education is absent in most American K 12 curricula  A report entitled  Running on Empty  The Failure to Teach K 12 Computer Science in the Digital Age  was released in October 2010 by Association for Computing Machinery  ACM  and Computer Science Teachers Association  CSTA   and revealed that only 14 states have adopted significant education standards for high school computer science  The report also found that only nine states count high school computer science courses as a core academic subject in their graduation requirements  In tandem with  Running on Empty   a new non partisan advocacy coalition   Computing in the Core  CinC    was founded to influence federal and state policy  such as the Computer Science Education Act  which calls for grants to states to develop plans for improving computer science education and supporting computer science teachers  Within the United States a gender gap in computer science education has been observed as well  Research conducted by the WGBH Educational Foundation and the Association for Computing Machinery  ACM  revealed that more than twice as many high school boys considered computer science to be a  very good  or  good  college major than high school girls  31  In addition  the high school Advanced Placement  AP  exam for computer science has displayed a disparity in gender  Compared to other AP subjects it has the lowest number of female participants  with a composition of about 15 percent women  32  This gender gap in computer science is further witnessed at the college level  where 31 percent of undergraduate computer science degrees are earned by women and only 8 percent of computer science faculty consists of women  33   edit  See also Computer science portal Book  Computer science
