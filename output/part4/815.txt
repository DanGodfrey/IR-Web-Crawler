mainly uninhabited  consisting largely of wetlands and swampy forest  However  Potawatomi Indians used trails along higher lying prehistoric ridges that ran in a general north south direction through the area  and had at least some semi permanent settlements along the trails  A part of downtown Evanston  as seen in October 2005  French explorers referred to the general area as  Grosse Pointe  after a point of land jutting into Lake Michigan about 13 miles  21 km  north of the mouth of the Chicago River  After the first non native Americans settled in the area in 1836  the names  Grosse Point Territory  and  Gross Point voting district  were used through the 1830s and 1840s  although the territory had no defined boundaries  5  6  The area remained only sparsely settled  supporting some farming and lumber activity on some of the higher ground  as well as a number of taverns or  hotels  along the ridge roads  In 1850  a township called Ridgeville was organized  extending from Graceland Cemetery in Chicago to the southern edge of the Ouilmette Reservation  along what is now Central Street  and from Lake Michigan to Western Avenue in Chicago  The 1850 census shows a few hundred settlers in this township  6  and a post office with the name of Ridgeville was established at one of the taverns  However  no municipality yet existed  In 1851  a group of Methodist business leaders founded Northwestern University and Garrett Biblical Institute  They chose a bluffed and wooded site along the lake as Northwestern s home  purchasing several hundred acres of land from Dr  John Foster  a Chicago farm owner  In 1854  the founders of Northwestern submitted to the county judge their plans for a city to be named Evanston after John Evans  one of their leaders  In 1857  the request was granted  7  The township of Evanston was split off from Ridgeville Township  at approximately the same time  that portion of Ridgeville south of Devon Avenue was organized as Lake View Township  8  Evanston was formally incorporated as a town on December 29  1863  but declined in 1869 to become a city despite the Illinois legislature passing a bill for that purpose  Evanston expanded after the Civil War with the annexation of the village of North Evanston  Finally  in early 1892  following the annexation of the Village of South Evanston  voters elected to organize as a city  9  The 1892 boundaries are largely those that exist today  During the 1960s  Northwestern University changed the city s shoreline by adding a 74 acre  300 000 m   lakefill  citation needed  In

Evanston  because of its strong Methodist influence  and its attempt to impose moral rigor  was called  Heavenston   18  In the early 20th century Evanston was called  The City of Churches   19  The varied works of numerous prominent architects  and many prominent mansions  especially near the lakefront  gave the town by the 1920s the sobriquet  The City of Homes   18  20  a fact often touted by local real estate agents  21  Use of the phrase has been attributed to a 1924 speech at the local Kiwanis club  22  Since the late 20th century  because of Evanston s activism and often left of center politics  it is sometimes humorously  or sarcastically  referred to as  The People s Republic of Evanston   23  24  25   E Town  is a nickname used often by Evanston s youth populace  and is

until they were assured the Chicago  amp  Milwaukee railroad line would run there  C amp M trains began stopping in Evanston in 1855  28  Evanston later experienced rapid growth as one of the first streetcar suburbs  The North Shore Line which gave the area its nickname started at Church Street in Evanston and continued up to Waukegan  Transit continues to make Evanston attractive today  The CTA

This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   July 2007  Beginning in the late 1990s  there has been considerable controversy over an explosion in high rise development  especially in the downtown district  Detractors contend that the development has taken away what they call a  unique Evanston identity   citation needed  They cite a growing number of local businesses that have gone out of business to be replaced with chain stores as its worst offense  In contrast proponents claim that the high rises have brought much needed life to what was a dying suburban downtown  and much needed revenues to chronically underfunded city coffers citation needed   Recently  as of 2006  there was concern with Evanston s low income population being able to find affordable housing  Evanston s west side  a formerly strong middle class African American community

Northwestern University A perennial debate in Evanston is the issue of Northwestern University s status as a tax exempt institution  In the founding charter of Northwestern University  signed in 1851  the state granted the school an exemption from paying property taxes  and unlike other well off private universities with statutory exemptions  48  it provides its own police services  but not firefighter paramedic services  It pays water  sewer  communications  real property transfer taxes  building permit fees  but not property taxes  Northwestern does not make Payments in Lieu of Taxes for the real estate it removes from property tax rolls  Northwestern s critics allege that it consumes far more from the city than it contributes  However  its backers contend that the benefits of having an elite research institution justify Northwestern s tax status  This controversy was revived in 2003 when the university purchased an eight story office building downtown  removing it from the tax rolls  An advisory referendum put on the April elections ballot  dubbed by supporters as a  Fair Share Initiative   received a majority  but was not passed into ordinance by the City Council  In September 2009  Northwestern purchased a fire truck for the city of Evanston at a cost of  550 000  Northwestern President Morton Schapiro stated  We are pleased to fund the purchase of this new fire

citizen taskforces convened to develop a plan to reduce the city s carbon footprint  56  The Evanston Climate Action Plan   ECAP   accepted by the City Council in November 2008  suggested over 200 strategies to make Evanston more sustainable  principally by reducing carbon emissions associated with transportation  buildings  energy sources  waste  and food production  57  58  In June  2011  the United States Conference of Mayors awarded Evanston first place in the small city category of the Mayors  Climate Protection Awards  based largely on the City s use of the ECAP  which the City asserts has reduced emissions by 24 000 metric tons per year  59  60  On Sept  15  2011  Wal Mart presented Mayor Tisdahl with a  15 000 award in recognition of the honor  which the mayor donated to Citizens

development of an environmentally sensitive lakefront and implementation of a comprehensive long range infrastructure plan  Another goal is to protect the city s natural resources and to build environment  not destroy it  The city also wants to improve its transportation resources to be more safe  integrated  accessible  responsive  and energy efficient  Evanston has an environment board 62  and an office of sustainability  63   edit  Offshore wind farm The single largest carbon reducing strategy identified in the ECAP  the development of an offshore wind farm  in Lake Michigan   64  gained widespread attention  65  In April 2010  Evanston s City Council voted to authorize issuing a Request for Information  RFI  so that interested parties could provide information on developing a wind energy facility 4 miles  6 4 km  off the coast of Lake Michigan  66  Following the receipt of responses  the Mayor appointed a committee to evaluate the information received  The committee s report was accepted in spring  2011  and the City Council voted to move forward with exploration of the concept  In the meantime  Evanston legislators introduced legislation  signed into law in summer  2011  creating a state offshore wind council to propose how to regulate possible development of such projects  citation needed   edit  Citizen and institutional efforts Northwestern University s Ford
