tapes he had compiled at Jane Asher s house  78  The tapes were mixes of various songs  musical pieces and comments made by McCartney that he had Dick James make into a demo record for him  79  Heavily influenced by John Cage  he made tape loops by recording voices  guitars  and bongoes on a Brenell tape recorder  and splicing the various loops together  He reversed the tapes  sped them up  and slowed them down to create the effects he wanted  some of which were later used on Beatles  recordings  such as  Tomorrow Never Knows   McCartney referred to the tapes as  electronic symphonies   80  In the spring of 1966 McCartney rented a ground floor and basement flat from Ringo Starr at 34 Montagu Square  to be used as a small demo studio for spoken word recordings by poets  writers

remixed versions of songs from throughout his solo career which were released under the title Twin Freaks  86  The Fireman s third album Electric Arguments was released on 25 November 2008  Unlike the first two Fireman albums  this one was more song based in its structure  McCartney told L A  Weekly in a January 2009   Fireman is improvisational theatre     I formalise it a bit to get it into the studio  and when I step up to a microphone  I have a vague idea of what I m about to do  I usually have a song  and I know the melody and lyrics  and my performance is the only unknown   87  Film McCartney was interested in animated films as a child  and later had the financial resources to ask Geoff Dunbar to direct a short animated film called Rupert and the Frog Song  in 1981  McCartney was the producer  he wrote the music and the script  and also added some of the character voices  88  McCartney wrote and starred in the 1984 film Give My Regards to Broad Street  The film and soundtrack

painting surfaced after watching artist Willem de Kooning paint  in Kooning s Long Island studio  100  McCartney took up painting in 1983  101  In 1999  he exhibited his paintings  featuring McCartney s portraits of John Lennon  Andy Warhol  and David Bowie  for the first time in Siegen  Germany  and included photographs by Linda  He chose the gallery because Wolfgang Suttner  local events organiser  was genuinely interested in his art  and the positive reaction led to McCartney showing his work in UK galleries  102  The first UK exhibition of McCartney s work was opened in Bristol  England with more than 50 paintings on display  McCartney had previously believed that  only people that had been to art school were allowed to paint    as Lennon had  102  In October 2000  Yoko Ono and McCartney presented art exhibitions in New York and London  McCartney said   I ve been offered an exhibition of my paintings at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool where John and I used to spend many a pleasant afternoon  So I m really excited about it  I didn t tell anybody I painted for 15 years but now I m out of the closet   103  104  As an artist  Paul McCartney designed a series of six

and poetry When McCartney was young  his mother read him poems and encouraged him to read books  McCartney s father was interested in crosswords and invited the two young McCartneys  Paul and his brother Michael  to solve them with him  so as to increase their  word power   106  McCartney was later inspired   in his school years   by Alan Durband  who was McCartney s English literature teacher at the Liverpool Institute  107  Durband was a co founder and fund raiser at the Everyman Theatre in Liverpool  where Willy Russell also worked  and introduced McCartney to Geoffrey Chaucer s works

and gave readings in Liverpool and New York City  111  Some of them were serious   Here Today   about Lennon  and some humorous   Maxwell s Silver Hammer    112  In the foreword of the book  McCartney explained that when he was a teenager  he had  an overwhelming desire  to have a poem of his published in the school magazine  He wrote something  deep and meaningful   but it was rejected  and he feels that he has been trying to get some kind of revenge ever since  His first  real poem  was about the death of his childhood friend  Ivan Vaughan  111  In October 2005  McCartney released a children s book called High in the Clouds  An Urban Furry Tail  In a press release publicising the book  McCartney said   I have loved reading for as long as I can remember   singling out Treasure Island as a childhood favourite  113  McCartney collaborated with author Philip Ardagh and animator Geoff Dunbar to write the book  114  Contact with fellow ex Beatles This section is about social and other general interactions  For creative collaborations  see Collaborations between ex Beatles  John Lennon Although McCartney s post Beatles relationship with John Lennon was troubled  they became close again briefly in 1974 and even played together for the only time since The Beatles split  see A Toot and a Snore in  74   In later years  the two grew apart again  115  McCartney would often call Lennon  but was never sure of what sort of reception he would get  116  such as when McCartney once called Lennon and was told   You re all pizza and fairytales    116  McCartney understood that he could not just phone Lennon and only talk about business  so they often talked about cats  baking bread  or babies  117  According to May Pang  during Lennon s  Lost Weekend  with her they planned to visit McCartney in New Orleans  where McCartney was recording the Venus and Mars album  but Lennon went back to Ono the day before the planned visit after Ono said she had a new cure for Lennon s smoking habit  118  In a 1980 interview  Lennon said that the last time he had seen McCartney was when they had watched the episode of Saturday Night Live  May 1976  in which Lorne Michaels had made his  3 000 cash offer 119  to get Lennon  McCartney  Harrison  and Starr to reunite on the show  McCartney and Lennon had seriously considered going to the studio  but were too tired  120  This event was fictionalised in the 2000 television film Two of Us  His last telephone call to Lennon  which was just before Lennon and Ono released Double Fantasy  was friendly  During the call  Lennon said  laughing  to McCartney   This housewife wants a career   121  which referred to Lennon s househusband years  while looking after Sean Lennon  122  In 1984  McCartney said this about the phone call   Yes  That is a nice thing  a consoling factor for me  because I do feel it was sad that we never actually sat down and straightened our differences out  But fortunately for me  the last phone conversation I ever had with him was really great  and we didn t have any kind of blow up   123  Linda McCartney  speaking in the same 1984 interview stated   I know that Paul was desperate to write with John again  And I know John was desperate to write  Desperate  People thought  well  he s taking care of Sean  he s a househusband and all that  but he wasn t happy  He couldn t write and it drove him crazy  And Paul could have helped him    easily   123  Reaction to Lennon s murder Main article  Death of John Lennon On the morning of 9 December 1980  McCartney awoke to the news that Lennon had been murdered outside his home in the Dakota building in New York City  124  Lennon s death created a media frenzy around the surviving members of The Beatles  125  On the evening of 9 December  as McCartney was leaving an Oxford Street recording studio  he was surrounded by reporters and asked for his reaction to Lennon s death  126  He was later criticised for what appeared  when published  to be an utterly superficial response   It s a drag    127  McCartney explained   When John was killed somebody stuck a microphone at me and said   What do you think about it   I said   It s a dra a ag  and meant it with every inch of melancholy I could muster  When you put that in print it says   McCartney in London today when asked for a comment on his dead friend said   It s a drag    It seemed a very flippant comment to make   127  McCartney was also to recall  I talked to Yoko the day after he was killed and the first thing she said was   John was really fond of you   The last telephone conversation I had with him we were still the best of mates  He was always a very warm guy  John  His bluff was all on the surface  He used to take his glasses down  those granny glasses  and say   It s only me   They were like a wall  you know  A shield  Those are the moments I treasure  128  In 1983  McCartney said  I would not have been as typically human and standoffish as I was if I knew John was going to die  I would have made more of an effort to try and get behind his  mask  and have a better relationship with him  128  In a Playboy interview in 1984  McCartney said that he went home that night and watched the news on television   while sitting with all his children   and cried all evening  McCartney carried on recording after the death of Lennon but did not play any live concerts for some time  He explained that this was because he was nervous that he would be  the next  to be murdered  129  130  This led to a disagreement with Denny Laine  who wanted to continue touring and subsequently left Wings  which McCartney disbanded in 1981  131  Also in June 1981  six months after Lennon s death  McCartney sang backup on George Harrison s tribute to Lennon   All Those Years Ago   which also featured Ringo Starr on drums  McCartney would go on to record  Here Today   a tribute song to Lennon  George Harrison In 1977  Harrison had this to say about working with McCartney   There were a lot of tracks though where I played bass   because what Paul would do  if he s written a song  he d learn all the parts for Paul and then come in the studio and say   Do this   He d never give you the opportunity to come out with something  Paul would always help along when you d done his ten songs then when he got  round to doing one of my songs  he would help  It was silly  It was very selfish  actually   132  While being interviewed circa 1988  Harrison said McCartney had recently mentioned the possibility of the two of them writing together  to which Harrison laughed   I ve only been there about 30 years in Paul s life and it s like now he wants to write with me   In September 1980  Lennon said of Harrison and McCartney s working relationship   I remember the day  Harrison  called to ask for help on  Taxman   one of his bigger songs  I threw in a few one liners to help the song along  because that s what he asked for  He came to me because he could not go to Paul  because Paul would not have helped him at that period   133  Despite this statement  McCartney did contribute to the song  playing the track s guitar solo  In late 2001  McCartney learned that Harrison was losing his battle with cancer  Upon Harrison s death on 29 November 2001  McCartney told Entertainment Tonight  Access Hollywood  Extra  Good Morning America  The Early Show  MTV  VH1 and Today that George was like his  baby brother   Harrison spent his last days in a Hollywood Hills mansion that was once leased by McCartney  134  On the day Harrison died  McCartney said

decided to tell him the truth     but I really didn t want to say anything  you know  because if I had my way I wouldn t have told anyone  I m not trying to spread the word about this  But the man from the newspaper is the man from the mass medium  I ll keep it a personal thing if he does too  you know     if he keeps it quiet  But he wanted to spread it so it s his responsibility  you know

the two  I would have to support Everton  But after a concert at Wembley Arena I got a bit of a friendship with Kenny Dalglish  who had been to the gig and I thought  You know what  I am just going to support them both because it s all Liverpool and I don t have that Catholic Protestant thing   So I did have to get special dispensation from the Pope to do this but that s it  too bad  I support them both  They are both great teams  but if it comes to the crunch  I m Evertonian   216  In 2010  there was heavy speculation surrounding McCartney that he was to head up a consortium launching a take
