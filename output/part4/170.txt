Before the 5th century This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  A Roman inscription at the castle hill of Tren  n  178 179 AD  Radiocarbon dating puts the oldest surviving archaeological artifacts from Slovakia   found near Nov  Mesto nad V hom   at 270 000 BC  in the Early Paleolithic era  These ancient tools  made by the Clactonian technique  bear witness to the ancient habitation of Slovakia  Other stone tools from the Middle Paleolithic era  200 000   80 000 BC  come from the Pr v t  Prepo tsk   cave near Bojnice and from other nearby sites  11  The most important discovery from that era is a Neanderthal cranium  c  200 000 BC   discovered near G novce  a village in northern Slovakia  Archaeologists have found prehistoric Homo sapiens skeletons in the region  as well as numerous objects and vestiges of the Gravettian culture  principally in the river valleys of Nitra  Hron  Ipe   V h and as far as the city of  ilina  and near the foot of the Vihorlat  Inovec  and Tribe  mountains  as well as in the Myjava Mountains  The most well known finds include the oldest female statue made of mammoth bone  22 800 BC   the famous Venus of Moravany  The statue was found in the 1940s in Moravany nad V hom near Pie  any  Numerous necklaces made of shells from Cypraca thermophile gastropods of the Tertiary period have come from the sites of Z kovsk   Podkovice  Hubina  and Rado inare  These findings provide the most ancient evidence of commercial exchanges carried out between the Mediterranean and Central Europe  Left  celt coin Biatec Right  5 slovak crowns with Biatec in front  The Bronze Age in Slovakia went through three stages of development  stretching from 2000 to 800 BC  Major cultural  economic  and political development can be attributed to the significant growth in production of copper  especially in central Slovakia  for example in  pania Dolina  and north west Slovakia  Copper became a stable source of prosperity for the local population  After the disappearance of the  akany and Velatice cultures  the Lusatian people expanded building of strong and complex fortifications  with the large permanent buildings and administrative centers  Excavations of Lusatian hill forts document the substantial development of trade and agriculture at that period  The richness and the diversity of tombs increased considerably  The inhabitants of the area manufactured arms  shields  jewelry  dishes  and statues  The arrival of tribes from Thrace disrupted the people of the Calenderberg culture  who lived in the hamlets located on the plain  Sere    and also in the hill forts located on the summits  Smolenice  Molp    The local power of the  Princes  of the Hallstatt culture disappeared in Slovakia during the last period of the Iron Age after strife between the Scytho Thracian people and the Celtic tribes  who advanced from the south towards the north  following the Slovak rivers  From around 500 BC  the territory of modern day Slovakia was settled by Celts  who built powerful oppida on the sites of modern day Bratislava and Havr nok  Biatecs  silver coins with the names of Celtic Kings  represent the first known use of writing in Slovakia  From 2 AD  the expanding Roman Empire established and maintained a series of outposts around and just north of the Danube  the largest of which were known as Carnuntum  whose remains are on the main road halfway between Vienna and Bratislava  and Brigetio  present day Sz ny at the Slovak Hungarian border   Near the northernmost line of the Roman hinterlands  the Limes Romanus  there existed the winter camp of Laugaricio  modern day Tren  n  where the Auxiliary of Legion II fought and prevailed in a decisive battle over the Germanic Quadi tribe in 179 AD during the Marcomannic Wars  The Kingdom of Vannius  a kingdom founded by the Germanic Suebian tribes of Quadi and Marcomanni  as well as several small Germanic and Celtic tribes  including the Osi and Cotini  existed in Western and Central Slovakia from 8 6 BC to 179 AD  The great invasions of the 4 7th centuries In the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD the Huns began to leave the Central Asian steppes  They crossed the Danube in 377 AD and occupied Pannonia  which they used for 75 years as their base for launching looting raids into Western Europe  However  Attila s death in 453 brought about the disappearance of the Hun tribe  In 568 a Turko Mongol tribal confederacy  the Avars  conducted their own invasion into the Middle Danube region  The Avars occupied the lowlands of the Pannonian Plain  established an empire dominating the Carpathian Basin  In 623  the Slavic population living in the western parts of Pannonia seceded from their empire after a revolution led by Samo  a Frankish merchant  12  After 626 the Avar power started to gradually decline 13  but their reign lasted to 804  Slavic states The Slavic tribes settled in the territory of present day Slovakia in the 5th century  Western Slovakia was the centre of Samo s empire in the 7th century  A Slavic state known as the Principality of Nitra arose in the 8th century and its ruler Pribina had the first known Christian church of Slovakia consecrated by 828  Together with neighboring Moravia  the principality formed the core of the Great Moravian Empire from 833  The high point of this Slavonic empire came with the arrival of Saints Cyril and Methodius in 863  during the reign of Prince Rastislav  and the territorial expansion under King Sv topluk I  The era of Great Moravia 830 896 Main article  Great Moravia Central Europe in the 9th century  Eastern Francia in blue  Bulgaria in orange  Great Moravia under Rastislav  870  in green  The green line marks the borders of Great Moravia under Svatopluk I  894   Please note that some of the borders of Great Moravia are under debate Great Moravia arose around 830 when Moim r I unified the Slavic tribes settled north of the Danube and extended the Moravian supremacy over them  14  When Mojm r I endeavoured to secede from the supremacy of the king of East Francia in 846  King Louis the German deposed him and assisted Moim r s nephew  Rastislav  846 870  in acquiring the throne  15  The new monarch pursued an independent policy  after stopping a Frankish attack in 855  he also sought to weaken influence of Frankish priests preaching in his realm  Rastislav asked the Byzantine Emperor Michael III to send teachers who would interpret Christianity in the Slavic vernacular  Upon Rastislav s request  two brothers  Byzantine officials and missionaries Saints Cyril and Methodius came in 863  Cyril developed the first Slavic alphabet and translated the Gospel into the Old Church Slavonic language  Rastislav was also preoccupied with the security and administration of his state  Numerous fortified castles built throughout the country are dated to his reign and some of them  e g   Dowina  sometimes identified with Dev n Castle  16  17  are also mentioned in connection with Rastislav by Frankish chronicles  18  19  During Rastislav s reign  the Principality of Nitra was given to his nephew Svatopluk as an appanage  17  The rebellious prince allied himself with the Franks and overthrew his uncle in 870  Similarly to his predecessor  Svatopluk I  871 894  assumed the title of the king  rex   During his reign  the Great Moravian Empire reached its greatest territorial extent  when not only present day Moravia and Slovakia but also present day northern and central Hungary  Lower Austria  Bohemia  Silesia  Lusatia  southern Poland and northern Serbia belonged to the empire  but the exact borders of his domains are still disputed by modern authors  14  20  Svatopluk also withstood attacks of the seminomad Magyar tribes and the Bulgarian Empire  although sometimes it was he who hired the Magyars when waging war against East Francia  21  In 880  Pope John VIII set up an independent ecclesiastical province in Great Moravia with Archbishop Methodius as its head  He also named the German cleric Wiching the Bishop of Nitra  After the death of King Svatopluk in 894  his sons Mojm r II  894 906   and Svatopluk II succeeded him as the King of Great Moravia and the Prince of Nitra respectively  17  However  they started to quarrel for domination of the whole empire  Weakened by an internal conflict as well as by constant warfare with Eastern Francia  Great Moravia lost most of its peripheral territories  In the meantime  the seminomad Magyar tribes  possibly having suffered defeat from the similarly nomadic Pechenegs  left their territories east of the Carpathian Mountains  22  invaded the Carpathian Basin and started to occupy the territory gradually around 896  23  Their armies  advance may have been promoted by continuous wars among the countries of the region whose rulers still hired them occasionally to intervene in their struggles  24  We do not know what happened with both Mojm r II and Svatopluk II because they are not mentioned in written sources after 906  In three battles  4 5 July and 9 August 907  near Bratislava  the Magyars routed Bavarian armies  Part of the historians put this year as the date of the breakup of the Great Moravian Empire  due to the Hungarian conquest other historians take the date a little bit earlier  to 902   Great Moravia left behind a lasting legacy in Central and Eastern Europe  The Glagolitic script and its successor Cyrillic were disseminated to other Slavic countries  charting a new path in their cultural development  The administrative system of Great Moravia may have influenced the development of the administration of the Kingdom of Hungary  citation needed  Kingdom of Hungary 1000 1919 Main article  Kingdom of Hungary  udov t  t r Following the disintegration of the Great Moravian Empire at the turn of the 10th century  the Hungarians annexed the territory comprising modern Slovakia  From the 11th century  when the territory inhabited by the Slovak speaking population of Danubian Basin was incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary  until 1918  when the Austro Hungarian empire collapsed  the territory of modern Slovakia was an integral part of the Hungarian state  25  26  27  The ethnic composition became more diverse with the arrival of the Carpathian Germans in the 13th century  and the Jews in the 14th century  A significant decline in the population resulted from the invasion of the Mongols in 1241 and the subsequent famine  However  in medieval times the area of the present day Slovakia was characterized rather by burgeoning towns  construction of numerous stone castles  and the cultivation of the arts  28  In 1465  King Matthias Corvinus founded the Hungarian Kingdom s third university  in Pozsony  Bratislava   but it was closed in 1490 after his death  29  Before the Ottoman Empire s expansion into Hungary and the occupation of Buda in 1541  the capital of the Kingdom of Hungary  under the name of Royal Hungary  moved to Pozsony  in Slovak  Prespork at that time  currently Bratislava   Pozsony became the capital city of the Royal Hungary in 1536  But the Ottoman wars and frequent insurrections against the Habsburg Monarchy also inflicted a great deal of devastation  especially in the rural areas  As the Turks withdrew from Hungary in the late 17th century  the importance of the territory comprising modern Slovakia decreased  although Pozsony retained its status as the capital of Hungary until 1848  when it was transferred to Buda  citation

culminating in the secession of Slovakia from Hungary after World War I  30  Interwar Czechoslovakia Main article  Czechoslovakia Milan Rastislav  tef nik In 1918  Slovakia and the regions of Bohemia  Moravia  Silesia and Carpathian Ruthenia formed a common state  Czechoslovakia  with the borders confirmed by the Treaty of Saint Germain and Treaty of Trianon  In 1919  during the chaos following the breakup of Austria Hungary  Czechoslovakia was formed with numerous Germans and Hungarians within the newly set borders  A Slovak patriot Milan Rastislav  tef nik  1880 1919   who helped organize Czechoslovak regiments against Austria Hungary during the First World War  died in a plane crash  In the peace following the World War  Czechoslovakia emerged as a sovereign European nation  citation needed  During the Interwar period  democratic Czechoslovakia was allied with France  and also with Romania and Yugoslavia  Little Entente   however  the Locarno Treaties of 1925 left East European security open  Both Czechs and Slovaks enjoyed a period of relative prosperity  Not only was there progress in the development of the country s economy  but in culture and in educational opportunities as well  The minority Germans came to accept their role in the new country and relations with Austria were good  Yet the Great Depression caused a sharp economic downturn  followed by political disruption and insecurity in Europe  31  Thereafter Czechoslovakia came under continuous pressure from the revisionist governments of Germany and Hungary  Eventually this led to the Munich Agreement of September 1938  which allowed Nazi Germany to partially dismember the country by occupying what was called the Sudetenland  a region with a German speaking majority and bordering Germany and Austria  The remainder of  rump  Czechoslovakia was renamed Czecho Slovakia and included a greater degree of Slovak political autonomy  Southern and eastern Slovakia  however  was claimed back by Hungary at the First Vienna Award of November 1938  citation needed  World War II Main article  Slovak Republic  1939 1945  After the Munich Agreement and its Vienna Award  Nazi Germany threatened to annex part of Slovakia and allow the remaining regions to be partitioned by Hungary or Poland unless independence was declared  Thus  Slovakia seceded from Czecho Slovakia in March 1939 and allied itself  as demanded by Germany  with Hitler s coalition  32  The government of the First Slovak Republic  led by Jozef Tiso and Vojtech Tuka  was strongly influenced by Germany and gradually became a puppet regime in many respects  Most Jews were deported from the country and taken to German labour camps  Thousands of Jews  however  remained to labor in Slovak work camps in Sered  Vyhne  and Nov ky  33  Tiso  through the granting of presidential exceptions  has been credited with saving as many as 40 000 Jews during the war  although other estimates place the figure closer to 4 000 or even 1 000  34  Nevertheless  under Tiso s government  83  of Slovakia s Jewish population  a total of 75 000 individuals  were murdered  35  though new estimates show increasing numbers of Jewish casualties  approximately 105 000 people  36  Tiso became the only European leader to actually pay Nazi authorities to deport his country s Jews  37  38  After it became clear that the Soviet Red Army was going to push the Nazis out of eastern and central Europe  an anti Nazi resistance movement launched a fierce armed insurrection  known as the Slovak National Uprising  near the end of summer 1944  A bloody German occupation and a guerilla war followed  The territory of Slovakia was liberated by Soviet and Romanian forces by the end of April 1945  Rule of the Communist party After World War II  Czechoslovakia was reconstituted and Jozef Tiso was hanged in 1947 for collaboration with the Nazis  More than 80 000 Hungarians 39  and 32 000 Germans 40  were forced to leave Slovakia  in a series of population transfers initiated by the Allies at the Potsdam Conference  41  This expulsion is still a source of tension between Slovakia and Hungary  citation needed  Out of about 130 000 Carpathian Germans in Slovakia in 1938  by 1947 only some 20 000 remained  42  Czechoslovakia came under the influence of the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact after a coup in 1948  The country was occupied by the Warsaw Pact forces  with the exception of Romania  in 1968  ending a period of liberalization under the leadership of Alexander Dub ek  In 1969  Czechoslovakia became a federation of the Czech Socialist Republic and the Slovak Socialist Republic  citation needed  Slovakia became a member of the European Union in 2004 and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007  Establishment of the Slovak Republic The end of Communist rule in Czechoslovakia in 1989  during the peaceful Velvet Revolution  was followed once again by the country s dissolution  this time into two successor states  In July 1992 Slovakia  led by Prime Minister Vladim r Me iar  declared itself a sovereign state  meaning that its laws took precedence over those of the federal government  Throughout the Autumn of 1992  Me iar and Czech Prime Minister V clav Klaus negotiated the details for disbanding the federation  In November the federal parliament voted to dissolve the country officially on 31 December 1992  The Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic went their separate ways after 1 January 1993  an event sometimes called the Velvet Divorce  43  44  Slovakia has remained a close partner with the Czech Republic  Both countries cooperate with Hungary and Poland in the Visegr d Group  Slovakia became a member of NATO on 29 March 2004 and of the European Union on 1 May 2004  On 1 January 2009  Slovakia
