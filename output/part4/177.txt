Thai       RTGS  Sayam  pronounced  s j  m   until 23 June 1939  13  when it was changed to Thailand  It was then renamed Siam from 1945 to 11 May 1949  after which it was again renamed Thailand  Also spelled Siem  Sy m or Sy ma  it has been identified with the Sanskrit  y ma         meaning  dark  or  brown    The names Shan and A hom seem to be variants of the same word  and  y ma is possibly not its origin but a learned and artificial distortion  14  The word Thai       is not  as commonly believed  citation needed  derived from the word Tai      meaning  freedom  in the Thai language  it is  however  the name of an ethnic group from the central plains  the Thai people   citation needed  A famous Thai scholar argued that Tai      simply means  people  or  human being  since his investigation shows that in some rural areas the word  Tai  was used instead of the usual Thai word  khon       for people  15  The Thai use the phrase  land of the free  to express pride in the fact that Thailand is the only country in Southeast Asia never colonized by a European power  While the Thai people will often refer to their country using the polite form Prathet Thai  Thai              they most commonly use the more colloquial word Mueang Thai  Thai            or simply Thai  Thai        the word mueang  Thai         meaning nation but most commonly used to refer to a city or town  Ratcha Anachak Thai  Thai                  means  Kingdom of Thailand  or  Kingdom of Thai   Etymologically  its components are   Ratcha   from Sanskrit raja  meaning  king  royal  realm      ana   from P li       authority  command  power   itself from Sanskrit  j    same meaning   chak  from Sanskrit cakra or cakra  meaning  wheel   a symbol of power and rule   The Thai National Anthem  Thai             composed and written by Peter Feit during the extremely  patriotic  1930s  refers to the Thai nation as  prathet thai  Thai              The first line of the national anthem is  prathet thai ruam lueat nuea chat chuea thai  Thai                                      and was translated in 1939 by Colonel Luang Saranuprabhandi as   Thailand is the unity of Thai blood and body    edit

meter high seated bronze Buddha in Wat Phanan Choeng from 1324 pre dates the founding of the city in 1351 The region known as Thailand has been inhabited by humans at least about 4 000 years ago  Similar to other regions in Southeast Asia  it was heavily influenced by the culture and religions of India  starting with the kingdom of Funan around the 1st century CE  16  After the fall of the Khmer Empire in the 13th century  various states thrived there  such as the various Tai  Mon  Khmer and Malay kingdoms  as seen through the numerous archaeological sites and artifacts that are scattered throughout the Siamese landscape  Prior to the 12th century however  the first Thai or Siamese state is traditionally considered to be the Buddhist kingdom of Sukhothai  which was founded in 1238  Following the decline and fall of the Khmer empire in the 13th 15th century  the Buddhist Tai kingdoms of Sukhothai  Lanna and Lan Xang  now Laos  were on the ascension  However  a century later  the power of Sukhothai was overshadowed by the new kingdom of Ayutthaya  established in the mid 14th century in the lower Chao Phraya River or Menam area  Ayutthaya s expansion centred along the Menam while in the northern valley the Lanna Kingdom and other small Tai city states ruled the area  In 1431  the Khmer abandoned Angkor after the Ayutthaya forces invaded the city  17  Thailand retained a tradition of trade with its neighbouring states  from China to India  Persia and Arab lands  Ayutthaya became one of the most vibrant trading centres in Asia  European traders arrived in the 16th century  beginning with the Portuguese  followed by the French  Dutch and English  After the fall of Ayutthaya in 1767 to the Burmese  King Taksin the Great moved the capital of Thailand to Thonburi for approximately 15 years  The current Rattanakosin era of Thai history began in 1782  following the establishment of Bangkok as capital of the Chakri dynasty under King Rama I the Great  According to Encyclop dia Britannica   A quarter to a third of the population of some areas of Thailand and Burma were slaves in the 17th through the 19th centuries   18  19  Kosa Pan presents King Narai s letter to Louis XIV at Versailles  1 September 1686 Despite European pressure  Thailand is the only Southeast Asian nation that has never been colonized  20  This has been ascribed to the long succession of able rulers in the past four centuries who exploited the rivalry and tension between French Indochina and the British Empire  As a result  the country remained a buffer state between parts of Southeast Asia that were colonized by the two colonizing powers  Great Britain and France  Western influence nevertheless led to many reforms in the 19th century and major concessions  most notably being the loss of a large territory on the east side of the Mekong to the French and the step by step absorption by Britain of the Malay Peninsula   edit  20th century The losses initially included Penang and eventually culminated in the loss of four predominantly ethnic Malay southern provinces  which later became Malaysia s four northern states  under the Anglo Siamese Treaty of 1909  In 1932  a bloodless revolution carried out by the Khana Ratsadon group of military and civilian officials resulted in a transition of power  when King Prajadhipok was forced to grant the people of Siam their first constitution  thereby ending centuries of absolute monarchy  During World War II  the Empire of Japan demanded the right to move troops across Thailand to the Malayan frontier  Japan invaded the country and engaged the Thai Army for six to eight hours before Plaek Pibulsonggram ordered an armistice  Shortly thereafter Japan was granted free passage  and on 21 December 1941  Thailand and Japan signed a military alliance with a secret protocol wherein Tokyo agreed to help Thailand regain territories lost to the British and French  Subsequently  Thailand declared war on the United States and the United Kingdom on 25 January 1942 and undertook to  assist  Japan in its war against the Allies  while at the same time maintaining an active anti Japanese resistance movement known as the Seri Thai  Approximately 200 000 Asian labourers  mainly romusha  and 60 000 Allied POWs worked on the Thailand Burma Death Railway  21  After the war  Thailand emerged as an ally of the United States  As with many of the developing nations during the Cold War  Thailand then went through decades of political instability characterised by coups d  tat as one military regime replaced another  but eventually progressed towards a stable prosperity and democracy in the 1980s  citation needed   edit  The southern region See also  South Thailand insurgency Thailand controlled the Malay Peninsula as far as Malacca in the 1400s and held much of the peninsula  including Temasek  Singapore  some of the Andaman Islands and a colony on Java  but eventually failed when the British used force to guarantee their suzerainty over the sultanate  Mostly the northern states of the Malay Sultanate presented annual gifts to the Thai king in the form of a golden flower  which understood the gesture to be tribute and an acknowledgement of vassalage  The British intervened in the Malay State and with the Anglo Siamese Treaty tried to build a railway from the south to Bangkok  Thailand relinquished sovereignty over what are now the northern Malay provinces of Kedah  Perlis  Kelantan and Terengganu to the British  Satun and Pattani provinces were given to Thailand  The Malay peninsula provinces were infiltrated by the Japanese during World War II  and by the Malayan Communist Party  CPM  from 1942 to 2008  when they decided to sue for peace with the Malaysian and Thai governments after the CPM lost its support from Vietnam and China subsequent to the Cultural Revolution  Recent insurgent uprisings may be a continuation of separatist fighting which started after World War II with Sukarno s support for the PULO  and the intensification  Most victims since the uprisings have been Buddhist and Muslim bystanders   edit  Politics and government Main articles  Politics of Thailand  Constitutions of Thailand  Law of Thailand  and Government of Thailand Rama IX  The current King of Thailand  The politics of Thailand is currently conducted within the framework of a constitutional monarchy  whereby the Prime Minister is the head of government and a hereditary monarch is head of state  The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislative branches   edit  History Bangkok s Democracy Monument  a representation of the 1932 Constitution sits on top of two golden offering bowls above a turret  Since the political reform of the absolute monarchy in 1932  Thailand has had 17 constitutions and charters  22  23  Throughout this time  the form of government has ranged from military dictatorship to electoral democracy  but all governments have acknowledged a hereditary monarch as the head of state  24  25   edit  28 June 1932 Prior to 1932  the Kingdom of Siam did not possess a legislature  as all legislative powers were vested within the person of the monarch  This had been the case since the foundation of the Sukhothai Kingdom in the 12th century  as the king was seen as a  Dharmaraja  or  King who rules in accordance with Dharma   the Buddhist law of righteousness   However on 24 June 1932 a group of civilians and military officers  calling themselves the Khana Ratsadon  or People s Party  carried out a bloodless revolution  in which the 150 years of absolute rule of the House of Chakri was ended  In its stead the group advocated a constitutional form of monarchy with an elected legislature  The  Draft Constitution  of 1932 signed by King Prajadhipok  created Thailand s first legislature  a People s Assembly with 70 appointed members  The assembly met for the first time on 28 June 1932  in the Ananda Samakhom Throne Hall  The Khana Ratsadon decided that the people were not yet ready for an elected assembly  however they later changed their minds  By the time the  permanent  constitution came into force in December of that year  elections were scheduled for 15 November 1933  The new constitution also changed the composition of the assembly to 78 directly elected and 78 appointed  by the Khana Ratsadon  together

consisting of a 500 seat House of Representatives                  sapha phutaen ratsadon  and a 200 seat Senate           wuthisapha   For the first time in Thai history  both houses were directly elected  Many human rights are explicitly acknowledged  and measures were established to increase the stability of elected governments  The House was elected by the first past the post system  where only one candidate with a simple majority could be elected in one constituency  The Senate was elected based on the province system  where one province can return more than one senator depending on its population size  The two houses of the National Assembly have two different terms  In accordance with the constitution the Senate is elected to a six year term  while the House is elected to a four year term  Overall the term of the National Assembly is based on that of the House  The National Assembly each year will sit in two sessions an  ordinary session  and a  legislative session   The first session of the National Assembly must take place within thirty days after the general election of the House of Representatives  The first session must be opened by the king in person by reading a Speech from the Throne  this ceremony is held in the Ananda Samakhom Throne Hall  He may also appoint the crown prince or a representative to carry out this duty  It is also the duty of the king to prorogue sessions through a Royal Decree when the House term expires  The king also has the prerogative to call extraordinary sessions and prolong sessions at his discretion  The National Assembly may host a  Joint sitting  of both Houses under several circumstances  These include  The appointment of a regent  any alteration to the 1924 Palace Law of Succession  the opening of the first session  the announcement of policies by the Cabinet of Thailand  the approval of the declaration of war  the hearing of explanations and approval of a treaty and the amendment of the Constitution  Members of the House of Representatives served four year terms  while senators served six year terms  The 1997 People s Constitution also promoted human rights more than any other constitutions  The court system

election under the 1997 Constitution  was called the most open  corruption free election in Thai history  27  The subsequent government was the first in Thai history to complete a four year term  The 2005 election had the highest voter turnout in Thai history  28  29  Despite efforts to clean up the system  vote buying and electoral violence remained problems of electoral quality in 2005  30  The PollWatch Foundation  Thailand s most prominent election watchdog  declared that vote buying in this election  specifically in the North and the Northeast  was more serious than in the 2001 election

critics a  chamber of generals  while others claimed that it lacks representatives from the poor majority  31  32  In this interim constitution draft  the head of the junta was allowed to remove the prime minister at any time  The legislature was not allowed to hold a vote of confidence against the cabinet and the public was not allowed to file comments on bills  33  This interim constitution was later surpassed by the permanent constitution on 24 August 2007  Martial law was partially revoked in January 2007  The ban on political activities was lifted in July 2007  34  following the 30 May

People s Alliance for Democracy  On 2 December 2008  Thailand s Constitutional Court in a highly controversial ruling found the Peoples Power Party 36  guilty of electoral fraud  which led to the dissolution of the party according to the law  It was later alleged in media reports that at least one member of the judiciary had a telephone conversation with officials working for the Office of the Privy Council and one other  The phone call was taped and has since circulated on the Internet  In it  the callers discuss finding a way to ensure the ruling PPP party would be disbanded  Accusations of judicial interference were levelled in the media but the recorded call was dismissed as a hoax  However  in June 2010  supporters of the eventually disbanded PPP were charged with tapping a judge s

kilometres  198 120 sq mi   1  Thailand is the world s 51st largest country by total area  It is slightly smaller than Yemen and slightly larger than Spain  Satellite image of flooding in Thailand in October 2011  Thailand is home to several distinct geographic regions  partly corresponding to the provincial groups  The north of the country is the mountainous area of the Thai highlands  with the highest point being Doi Inthanon in the Thanon Thong Chai Range at 2 565 metres  8 415 ft  above sea level  The northeast  Isan  consists of the Khorat Plateau  bordered to the east by the Mekong River  The centre of the country is dominated by the predominantly flat Chao Phraya river valley  which runs into the Gulf of Thailand  Southern Thailand consists of the narrow Kra Isthmus that widens into the Malay Peninsula  Politically  there are six geographical regions which differ from the others in population  basic resources  natural features  and level of social and economic development  The diversity of the regions is the most pronounced attribute of Thailand s physical setting  The Chao Phraya and the Mekong River are the sustainable resource of rural Thailand  Industrial scale production of crops use both rivers and their tributaries  The Gulf of Thailand covers 320 000 square kilometres  124 000 sq mi  and is fed by the Chao Phraya  Mae Klong  Bang Pakong and Tapi Rivers  It contributes to the tourism sector owing to its clear shallow waters along the coasts in the Southern Region and the Kra Isthmus  The Gulf of Thailand is also an industrial centre of Thailand with the kingdom s main port in Sattahip along with being the entry gates for Bangkok s Inland Seaport  The Andaman Sea is regarded as Thailand s most precious natural resource as it hosts the most popular and luxurious resorts in Asia  Phuket  Krabi  Ranong  Phang Nga and Trang and their lush islands all lay along the coasts of the Andaman Sea and despite the 2004 Tsunami  they continue to be and ever more so  the playground of the rich and elite of Asia and the world  Plans have resurfaced of a logistical connection of the two bodies of water which would be coined the Thai Canal  analogous to the Suez and the Panama Canal  Such an idea has been greeted with positive accounts by Thai politicians as it would cut fees charged by the Ports of Singapore  improve ties with China and India  lower shipping times and increase ship safety owing to pirate fears in the Strait of Melaka and  support the Thai government s policy of being the logistical hub for Southeast Asia  The ports would improve economic conditions in the south of Thailand  which relies heavily on tourism income  and it would also change the structure of the Thai economy moving it closer to a services centre of Asia  The canal would be a major engineering project and has expected costs of 20 30 billion dollars  The local climate is tropical and characterized by monsoons  There is a rainy  warm  and cloudy southwest monsoon from mid May to September  as well as a dry  cool northeast monsoon from November to mid March  The southern isthmus is always hot and humid   edit  Education Main article  Education in Thailand Primary school students in Thailand Thailand enjoys a high level of literacy  and education is provided by a well organized school system of kindergartens  primary  lower secondary and upper secondary schools  numerous vocational colleges  and universities  The private sector of education is well developed and significantly contributes to the overall provision of education which the government would not be able to meet through the public establishments  Education is compulsory up to and including age group 14  and the government provides free education through to age group 17  Chulalongkorn University  established in 1917 is the oldest university in Thailand  Thailand has never been colonized  and its teaching relies heavily on rote rather than on student centred methodology  The establishment of reliable and coherent curricula for its primary and secondary schools is subject to such rapid changes that schools and their teachers are not always sure what they are supposed to be teaching  and authors and publishers of textbooks are unable to write and print new editions quickly enough to keep up with the volatile situation  The issue concerning university entrance has therefore also been in constant upheaval for a number of years  Nevertheless  education has seen its greatest progress in the years since 2001  Most of the present generation of students are computer literate  and knowledge of English is on the increase at least in quantity if not in quality  Extensive nationwide IQ tests were carried out in December 2010 to January 2011 on 72 780 Thai students  The average IQ was found to be at 98 59  which is higher than previous studies have found  The IQ levels are not consistent throughout the country though  with the lowest average of 88 07 found in the southern region of Narathiwat and the highest average of 108 91 reported in Nonthaburi province  The Thai Ministry of Public Health blames the discrepancies on iodine deficiency and

 It provides users with regularly scheduled light   edit  Economy Main article  Economy of Thailand Bangkok  the largest city  business and industrial centre of the country Thailand is an emerging economy and considered as a newly industrialized country  After enjoying the world s highest growth rate from 1985 to 1996   averaging 12 4  annually   increased pressure on Thailand s currency  the baht  in 1997  the year in which the economy contracted by 1 9  led to a crisis that uncovered financial sector weaknesses and forced the Chavalit Yongchaiyudh administration to float the currency  however  Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh was forced to resign after his cabinet came under fire for its slow response to the crisis  The baht was pegged at 25 to the US dollar from 1978 to 1997  however  the baht reached its lowest point of 56 to the US dollar in January 1998 and the economy contracted by 10 8  that year  This collapse prompted the Asian financial crisis  Thailand s economy started to recover in 1999  expanding 4 2  and 4 4  in 2000  thanks largely to strong exports  Growth  2 2   was dampened by the softening of the global economy in 2001  but picked up in the subsequent years owing to strong growth in Asia  a relatively weak baht encouraging exports and increasing domestic spending as a result of several mega projects and incentives of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra  known as Thaksinomics  Growth in 2002  2003 and 2004 was 5 7  annually  Growth in 2005  2006 and 2007 hovered around 4 5   Due both to the weakening of the US dollar and an increasingly strong Thai currency  by March 2008  the dollar was hovering around the 33 baht mark  Thailand exports an increasing value of over  105 billion worth of goods and services annually  1  Major exports include Thai rice  textiles and footwear  fishery products  rubber  jewellery  cars  computers and electrical appliances  Thailand is the world s no 1 exporter of rice  exporting more than 6 5 million tons of milled rice annually  Rice is the most important crop in the country  Thailand has the highest percentage of arable land  27 25   of any nation in the Greater Mekong Subregion  52  About 55  of the arable land area is used for rice production  53  Substantial industries include electric appliances  components  computer parts and cars  while tourism in Thailand makes up about 6  of the economy  Prostitution in Thailand and sex tourism also form a de facto part of the economy  Cultural milieu combined with poverty and the lure of money have caused prostitution and sex tourism in particular to flourish in Thailand  One estimate published in 2003 placed the trade at US 4 3 billion per year or about three percent of the Thai economy  54  According to research by Chulalongkorn University on the Thai illegal economy  prostitution in Thailand in the period between 1993 and 1995  made up around 2 7  of the GDP  55  It is believed that at least 10  of tourist dollars are spent on the sex trade  56  Thailand is the largest rice exporter in the world The economy of Thailand is an emerging economy which is heavily export dependent  with exports accounting for more than two thirds of gross domestic product  GDP  The exchange rate is Baht 33 00 USD  Thailand has a GDP worth 8 5 trillion Baht  on a purchasing power parity  PPP  basis   or US 627 billion  PPP   This classifies Thailand as the 2nd largest economy in Southeast Asia after Indonesia  Despite this  Thailand ranks midway in the wealth spread in Southeast Asia as it is the 4th richest nation according to GDP per capita  after Singapore  Brunei and Malaysia  It functions as an anchor economy for the neighboring developing economies of Laos  Burma  and Cambodia  Thailand s recovery from the 1997 1998 Asian financial crisis depended mainly on exports  among various other factors  Thailand ranks high among the world s automotive export industries along with manufacturing of electronic goods  Between 1997 and 2010  4 306 mergers  amp  acquisitions with a total known value of USD 81 billion with the involvement of Thai firms have been announced  57  The year 2010 was a new record in terms of value with USD 12 billion of transactions  The largest transaction with involvement of Thai companies has been  PTT Chemical PCL merged with PTT Aromatics and Refining PCL valued at USD 3 8 billion in 2011  58  49  of Thailand s labor force is employed in agriculture  however this is less than the 70  employed in 1980  59  Agriculture has been experiencing a transition from labour intensive and transitional methods into a more industrialised and competitive sector  59  Between 1962 and 1983  the agricultural sector grew by 4 1  on average a year and continued to grow at 2 2  between 1983 and 2007  59  However  the relative contribution of agriculture to GDP has declined while exports of goods and services have increased  Sites like The Sanctuary of Truth help the tourist economy  Tourism revenues are on the rise  With the instability surrounding the recent coup and the military rule  however  the GDP growth of Thailand has settled at around 4 5  from previous highs of 5 7  under the previous civilian administration  as investor and consumer confidence has been degraded somewhat due to political uncertainty  The incumbent elected civilian administration under Samak Sundaravej in power from 29 January to 9 September 2008 stated that the economy will have grown by 5 5  to 6  by the end of 2008  Due to rising oil and food prices  the annual inflation rate for 2008 shot up to 9 2  in July  a 10 year high  Thailand generally uses the metric system but traditional units of measurement for land area are used  and imperial measure  feet  inches etc   are

closely related to Lao  Shan in Burma  and numerous smaller languages spoken in an arc from Hainan and Yunnan south to the Chinese border  It is the principal language of education and government and spoken throughout the country  The standard is based on the dialect of the central Thai people  and it is written in the Thai alphabet  an abugida script that evolved from the Khmer script  Several other dialects exist  and coincide with the regional designations  Southern Thai is spoken in the southern provinces  and Northern Thai is spoken in the provinces that were formally part of the independent kingdom of Lannathai  Thailand is also host to several other minority languages  the largest of which is the Lao dialect of Isan spoken in the northeastern provinces  Although sometimes considered a Thai dialect  it is a Lao dialect  and the region in where it is traditionally spoken was historically part of the Lao kingdom of Lan Xang  In the far south  Yawi  a dialect of Malay  is the primary language of the Malay Muslims  Varieties of Chinese are also spoken by the large Chinese population  with Teochew being best represented  Numerous tribal languages are also spoken  including those belonging to the Mon Khmer family  such as Mon  Khmer  Viet  Mlabri and Orang Asli  Austronesian family  such as Cham and Moken  Sino Tibetan family such as Lawa  Akhan  and Karen  and other Tai languages such as Nyaw  Phu Thai  and Saek  Hmong is a member of the Hmong Mien languages  which is now regarded as a language family of its own  English is a mandatory school subject  but

many influences  including Indian  Lao  Burmese  Cambodian  and Chinese  Its traditions incorporate a great deal of influence from India  China  Cambodia  and the rest of Southeast Asia  Thailand s national religion Theravada Buddhism is important to modern Thai identity  Thai Buddhism has evolved over time to include many regional beliefs originating from Hinduism  animism as well as ancestor worship  The official calendar in Thailand is based on the Eastern version of the Buddhist Era  which is 543 years ahead of the Gregorian  western  calendar  For example  the year AD 2011 is 2554 BE in Thailand  Several different ethnic groups  many of which are marginalized  populate Thailand  Some of these groups overlap into Burma  Laos  Cambodia  and Malaysia and have mediated change between their traditional local culture  national Thai and global cultural influences  Overseas Chinese also form a significant part of Thai society  particularly in and around Bangkok  Their successful integration into Thai society has allowed for this group to hold positions of economic and political power  Khon Show is the most stylised form of Thai performance  The traditional Thai greeting  the wai  is generally offered first by the younger of the two people meeting  with their hands pressed together  fingertips pointing upwards as the head is bowed to touch their face to the hands  usually coinciding with the spoken word  Sawasdee khrap  for male speakers  and  Sawasdee ka  for females  The elder then is to respond afterwards in the same way  Social status and position  such as in government  will also have an influence on who performs the wai first  For example  although one may be considerably older than a provincial governor  when meeting it is usually the visitor who pays respect first  When children leave to go to school  they are taught to wai to their parents to represent their respect for them  They do the same when they come back  The wai is a sign of respect and reverence for another  similar to the namaste greeting of India and Nepal  Muay Thai  or Thai boxing  is the national sport in Thailand and its native martial art call  Muay   In the past  Muay  was taught to royal soldiers for combat on battlefield if unarmed  After they retired from the army  these soldiers often became Buddhist monks and stayed at the temples  Most of the Thai people s lives are closely tied to Buddhism and temples  they often send their sons to be educated with the monks   Muay  is also one of the subjects taught in the temples  71  Muay Thai achieved popularity all over the world in the 1990s  Although similar martial arts styles exist in other Southeast Asian countries  few enjoy the recognition that Muay Thai has received with its full contact rules allowing strikes including elbows  throws and knees  Thousands of Khom Fai in Mae Cho  Loi Krathong festivals Chiang Mai Association football  however  has possibly overtaken Muay Thai s position as most widely viewed and liked sport in contemporary Thai society and it is not uncommon to see Thais cheering their favourite English Premier League teams on television and walking around in replica kits  Another widely enjoyed pastime  and once a competitive sport  is kite flying  Thai seafood curry  an example of Thai cuisine  Thai cuisine blends five fundamental tastes  sweet  spicy  sour  bitter and salty  Some common ingredients used in Thai cuisine include garlic  chillies  lime juice  lemon grass  and fish sauce  The staple food in Thailand is rice  particularly jasmine variety rice  also known as Hom Mali rice  which is included in almost every meal  Thailand is the world s largest exporter of rice  and Thais domestically consume over 100 kg of milled rice per person per year  53  Over 5000 varieties of rice from Thailand are preserved in the rice gene bank of the International Rice Research Institute  IRRI   based in the Philippines  The king of Thailand is the official patron of IRRI  72  Like most Asian cultures  respect towards ancestors is an essential part of Thai spiritual practice  Thais have a strong sense of hospitality and generosity  but also a strong sense of social hierarchy  Seniority is an important concept in Thai culture  Elders have by tradition ruled in family decisions or ceremonies  Older siblings have duties to younger ones  Taboos in Thailand include touching someone s head or pointing with the feet  as the head is considered the most sacred and the foot the dirtiest part of the body  Thai society has been influenced in recent years by its widely available multi language press and media  There are some English and numerous Thai and Chinese newspapers in circulation  most Thai popular magazines use English headlines as a chic glamor factor  Many large businesses in Bangkok operate in English as well as other languages  Thailand is the largest newspaper market in Southeast Asia with an estimated circulation of at least 13 million copies daily in 2003  Even upcountry  out of Bangkok  media flourishes  For example  according to Thailand s Public Relations Department Media Directory 2003 2004  the nineteen provinces of Isan

person to officially formulate and bottle Namman Muay  Thai Liniment  which is desired for his fighter  Pone Kingpetch  Namman Muay  Thai Liniment  is still only produced by his direct descendants in Thailand  Traditional Muay Thai practiced today varies significantly from the ancient art Muay Boran and uses kicks  punches and knee and elbow strikes in a ring with gloves similar to those used in Western boxing and this has led to Thailand gaining medals at the Olympic Games in Boxing  Takraw  Thai          is a sport native to Thailand  which the players hit a rattan ball and only be allowed to use their feet  knees  chest and head to touch the ball  Sepak Takraw is a form of this sport which appears in volley ball style  the players must volley a ball over a net and force it to hit the

Rajamangala Stadium  The tribunes form a continuous ring which are quite low behind each goal but rise up on each side  Unlike the Rajamangala though  Thammasat has a roof covering both side tribunes  Most striking about this stadium are the floodlights  Thai architects usually favour concrete pylons but these are the steel variety  As viewed from the exterior of the stadium the base of each pylon seems to grip the outside of the stadium and they dramatically lean over the tribunes so as to better illuminate the playing area  Thammasat was going to be used for PEA FC s match against Singapore Armed Forces FC in an Asian Champions League qualifier in February 2009 but the pitch was deemed unplayable and the match was switched to the Rajamangala  Rajamangala National Stadium is the biggest sporting arena in Thailand  It currently has a capacity of 65 000  It is located in Bang Kapi  Bangkok  The stadium was built in 1998 for the 1998 Asian Games and is the home stadium of Thailand
