appeared in X Men  54  March 1969    edit  Fictional character biography  edit  Origins Alexander Summers was born in Honolulu  Hawaii  He is the second of the three known sons of Christopher Summers  a United States Air Force Major and test pilot and his wife Katherine Anne  When Alex was a boy growing up in Anchorage  Alaska  United States  his father took the family for a flight in their airplane  which came under attack by a Shi ar spaceship  As the plane caught fire and was crashing  his parents fastened Alex and Scott into a parachute and pushed them off the plane in hopes that they would survive  The Summers boys were recovered and put into an orphanage and Alex was soon adopted though Scott remained there for much of his childhood  Alex was raised by the Blandings whose son  Todd  had died in a car accident  1  They tried to make Alex fit into the image of their son  and he tried to do as best he could  When the boy responsible for Todd s death kidnapped Alex and his foster sister  Haley  Alex manifested his powers for the first time  incinerating the boy  Mister Sinister  an evil geneticist who was obsessed with the Summers bloodline  appeared eager yet surprised that Alex s potential exceeded Scott s   despite the fact that he seemed to lack control over his gift  Sinister placed psi blocks on both Alex and Haley s minds  causing them to forget what had happened that night   edit  First encounter with X Men Alex went on to study and earn a degree in geophysics at college  There he first met the original X Men  and learned that Cyclops is his brother  His mutant powers became apparent when he was kidnapped by the Living Pharaoh  who declared Alex the only being able to rival his power  The two shared the same cosmic energy absorption abilities  in reverse proportion to each other  By locking Alex in a shielded cell  the Pharaoh was able to absorb enough cosmic energy to become the Living Monolith  The X Men fought a losing battle against the virtually unstoppable Monolith  until Alex managed to free himself  and the Monolith turned back into the Living Pharaoh  2  Alex s mutant power at first seemed to manifest itself only when he was near death  He was unable to control it  and feared its immense power  Alex was later captured by Larry Trask and his Sentinels  who were bent on controlling or eradicating all mutants  Trask fashioned a costume for Alex that would help him control his powers and Alex was given the code name Havok  Trask turned out to be a mutant himself and the Sentinels were defeated by the X Men  Havok lost control of his powers  however  and his excess energy was absorbed by Sauron  Havok then gained control of his powers  3  Havok actively joined the X Men and began a relationship with Lorna Dane Polaris  much to the anger of Iceman who was romantically interested in her as well  While the senior X Men were in the Savage Land  Havok and Polaris were approached by Professor X about the imminent invasion of the alien Z Nox  During this time  the couple fell in love  With the original X Men  Havok and Polaris were captured by Krakoa the living island  but were rescued by the new X Men  4  Havok and Polaris then quit the team s active membership along with most of the original members  5  Havok was again captured by the Living Pharaoh  and was this time rescued by Spider Man and Thor  6  Havok and Polaris were occasional members and allies of the X Men for years  They alternated between doing graduate work and earning a postgraduate degree in the American Southwest   where they occasionally encountered the Hulk   and helping out Moira MacTaggert at her facility for genetic research on Muir Island  off the coast of Scotland  It was during their stay on Muir Island that Havok helped the X Men battle Proteus  7  Eventually  Alex learned that Corsair of the Starjammers was really his father  8  During one of their adventures  Polaris was possessed by the mutant Marauder Malice  ending the romantic relationship for a time  Havok then sought out and rejoined the X Men  9   edit  Wolverine and the X Men During this period  Havok became involved with Madelyne Pryor  Both of them had been rejected by their previous lovers  Pryor s then husband Cyclops had left her for Jean Grey  Madelyne was manipulated by N astirh and became the Goblin Queen  She attempted to use Havok to help take over the world and transform it into a demonic realm  Havok eventually came to his senses and Madelyne killed herself after discovering she was a clone of Jean Grey  Havok befriended Wolverine and they shared adventures  While they were vacationing in Mexico  they were targeted by a terrorist cell  They defeated the cell  but were fooled by a damsel in distress who was actually a member of the terrorist group  Havok woke up in a hospital  in the care of nurse Scarlett McKenzie  the assassin without disguise  She manipulated Havok and made him fall in love with her  Scarlett was working for the Russian terrorists  Dr  Neutron and Meltdown  Having previously failed to charge up Meltdown s superpowers with the energy released from Chernobyl nuclear disaster  they wanted to use Havok as a conduit to channel the energy of an atomic reactor into Meltdown  Scarlett fed Havok with false information that terrorists were trying to sabotage a nuclear power station  When he ventured into the heart of the reactor  he found it reaching critical limit  According to plan  Havok tried to absorb the dangerous radiation  however  when he witnessed Meltdown killing Scarlett  he unleashed the energy into Meltdown bringing him up to full power  Wolverine arrived and prevented a full disaster by battling with Meltdown  while Havok continued to absorb energy from the reactor  still on the verge of explosion  Wolverine killed Meltdown by penetrating his body with multiple control rods that slowed down the nuclear reactions raging within him  and Havok redirected the nuclear radiation into space  10  Around this time  Havok rescued Leila O Toole from the Trackers  With Wolverine  he discovered that Leila was actually Plasma  the Living Pharaoh s niece  Havok defeated Plasma and the Trackers  11   edit  Genosha After going through the Siege Perilous with several other X Men fleeing Reavers  the cyborg hunters  volume  amp  issue needed  Havok

as a leader  once seemingly drinking poison in an effort to buck up the spirits of Strong Guy  who had been poisoned   What Alex drank had been water   volume  amp  issue needed  Havok and X Factor were called on to subvert a civil war aggravated by the Pantheon  In this instance  Alex physically challenged the Hulk  He soaked up the various energies that fuel Hulk and used them to bolster his plasma blasts  thereby gaining an advantage  It was the second time Havok had beaten the Hulk  12  During this time  Havok s team participated in the events of the Infinity War and the Infinity Crusade  Alex and Strong Guy participated the most in far reaching  reality altering cosmic battles  Multiple Man had contracted the Legacy Virus in Genosha and later chose to undergo a seemingly mystical healing effort  13  Despite the procedure s previous success with Wolfsbane  curing her of her unnatural love for Alex  Multiple Man perished  14  This hit Havok hard  as he felt responsible since Madrox was under his command  He left the team for Hawaii  where he and Polaris enjoyed a romantic honeymoon until Malice  Mr  Sinister and The Nasty Boys showed up  15  Reinforcements helped Havok and Polaris survive the villains  16  Shortly afterward  Strong Guy suffered a heart attack and ended up in stasis  17  and Wolfsbane left to be with her foster mother  18  After the Age of Apocalypse event  Havok accidentally destroyed a dam and was forced back into his old containment suit  After new members Wild Child  Shard and Mystique were introduced to the team  Havok fought Random and was captured by the Dark Beast  He was brainwashed into serving Dark Beast and Onslaught  He broke free of the brainwashing  but used it as an opportunity to infiltrate the enemy and recreated a version of the Brotherhood of Mutants  He succeeded in defeating Dark Beast and attempted to mend fences with his former X Factor teammates  specifically Polaris and Multiple Man  the man who had died had been a Madrox duplicate   While Havok was attempting to reform X Factor  one of his time traveling team members  Greystone  created an experimental time travel device to return him to the future  It exploded in mid air  seemingly killing Havok and Greystone in front of their teammates   edit  Mutant X Main article  Mutant X  comics  Mutant X In actuality  Havok was cast into a parallel world where he was the leader of a drastically altered version of X Factor  known as The Six  In this world  he was the leader of the original X Men  since his brother Cyclops was abducted by the Shi ar along with his parents  He found he was married to Madelyne Pryor  with whom he had a son named Scotty  and all his friends were twisted versions of the ones he knew  Despite being unfamiliar with this realm  Havok willingly took over the role of father for Scotty  though the boy knew he was not really his dad  Havok becomes leader of The Six and his adventures in this reality lead to a disaster which leaves most of the superhumans dead  Havok is able to save the world itself before being cast into black nothingness   edit  Resurrection However  Havok was found back in the original reality in a coma  The X Men were able to restore his psyche with the help of the son of Havok s nurse  Annie Ghazikhanian  When he was reunited with Polaris  she asked him to marry her  to which he did not respond  Beast immediately congratulated them  and Havok said nothing further  Likely he felt he should want to marry Lorna  but did not love her as he had before  Unknown to Havok  Polaris  and Annie  Carter had used his telepathy to link Annie and Alex s dreams while Alex was comatose  In their dreams Havok and Annie fell in love  unknown to Alex but not Annie  Before his wedding Scott tested Alex s resolve by hiring a shapeshifter to morph into Annie  something that disturbed Alex very deeply  The night before the wedding  Alex had a dream convincing him that he now loved Annie  During the wedding Alex stopped the proceedings and called off the marriage  Lorna  already affected by the incident at Genosha  tried to kill Annie and Carter  only to be stopped by Juggernaut and Havok  volume  amp  issue needed  Alex revealed to Annie that it was Carter who linked the two due to their loneliness and that Alex loved her  Despite the fact that Iceman had started a relationship with Annie  he expressed his feelings for Lorna  volume  amp  issue needed  Havok and Annie s relationship continued until an impending attack on the X Mansion at the hands of a new Brotherhood of Mutants led by Exodus  This caused Annie to leave Havok and take her son away from the X Men feeling it was no longer safe for the two to live at the mansion  She wanted Alex to come with them  but his duty was to his team  so mother and son left for parts unknown  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Decimation With Annie and Carter now gone  Havok s mind seems to be mending  since he expressed feelings to resume his relationship with Polaris  who moved on after being rejected and was dating her former boyfriend Iceman  During the post  House of M  storyline  many mutants lost their powers  When Polaris revealed that she had lost her powers  she left the X Men  and Havok decided to leave with her  However  after he and Polaris encountered the creature called  Daap   during which Lorna was abducted  Havok returned to the X Mansion to see a Sphinx bearing the face of Apocalypse  volume  amp  issue needed  He then returned to active duty to bring down Apocalypse with the remainder of his squad  composed of Rogue  Iceman  and new member Mystique  Havok single handedly destroyed the antidote to Apocalypse s meta plague  which had been a key element in his plan to decimate the human population  Gambit was turned into a horseman and clashed with Havok and the other X Men  During the last battle  Iceman struck down Pestilence  who was revealed to be Polaris  As her esophagus closed down  Havok administered CPR to save her life  but was infected with the meta plague  Luckily  Emma Frost had saved some of the antidote Havok destroyed earlier and cured him with it  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  The Rise and Fall of The Shi ar Empire Havok was recruited by Professor X  19  along with Marvel Girl  Rachel Summers   Nightcrawler  Warpath  Darwin and Polaris to participate in a space mission to stop Vulcan from unleashing his powers on the Shi ar empire  Havok has recently been reunited with Corsair  his father  and brought him news about Vulcan  His current relationship with Polaris is still developing  Polaris seems to finally show concrete signs of forgiving Havok  telling him to  just shut up and kiss  her after the team won their first battle against the entire regiment of Shi ar soldiers in their beginning struggle against D Ken and in support of Lilandra  20  Although Havok initially rebuffs her advances  hesitant to  start up again after  everything that happened between them  Lorna says that he needs to  blow off some steam  and the scene ends with them kissing  During the final battle  21  Corsair tries to reason with his son Vulcan but Vulcan kills his father where he stands  Havok  enraged by this  launches an attack at his brother with intention of killing him  but is easily defeated  In the end  Nightcrawler  Warpath  and Hebizbah get the injured Professor X and Darwin back to the ship  but Lilandra sends the ship back to Earth  leaving Havok and his teammates stranded  Havok along with Polaris  Rachel  Korvus  Ch od  and Raza form a new team of Starjammers after the death of Corsair  dedicated to defeating Vulcan and restoring Lilandra to the throne  22   edit  Starjammers The civil war between Vulcan s forces and those loyal to the dethroned Lilandra rages on  Led by Havok and the Starjammers  Lilandra s forces gradually whittle away at Vulcan s forces  which are plagued by defections  The Shi ar  contrary to Vulcan s expectations  are not happy to have an outsider as their ruler  Vulcan is discouraged by this  but Deathbird convinces him that they will come to accept him  Warned in advance of a rebel raid on Feather s Edge  Vulcan and his fleet ambush the Starjammers  However  in the middle of the battle  his ship  the Hammer  is destroyed by the Scy ar Tal  translates as  Death to the Shi ar    Vulcan and Gladiator attack the leader of the Scy ar Tal and are easily defeated  whereupon they retreat deeper into Shi ar space  Marvel Girl makes contact with the Eldest Scy ar Tal and discovers their true origin  The Scy ar Tal were originally called the M Kraan  Early in their history  the Shi ar attacked them  killed a great number of their people  making the rest flee for their lives  Eventually  the Shi ar settled on their planet  took the M Kraan Crystal as their own  and passed down the legend of the M Kraan Crystal as a sacred gift from their deities  Sharra  amp  K ythri  The M Kraan then changed their named to Scy ar Tal and devoted their culture and society to the destruction of the Shi ar Empire  With their first attack  they destroyed Feather s Edge by transporting a star to obliterate it  After which  Vulcan makes contact with the Starjammers to call a temporary ceasefire  Under the ceasefire  the Shi ar and the Starjammers decide to take out the Finality  thus crippling the Scy ar s biggest threat  Once Havok and Vulcan are in position to destroy Finality  the Eldest Scy ar tries to stop them  Once Vulcan figures out how the Eldest is powered  he severs the connection Eldest has with his brothers  making him powerless  Once the connection is severed  the Scy ar become unorganized  and the tide of the battle shifts to the Shi ar  The Shi ar then proceed to attack both the Scy ar and the Starjammers  Meanwhile  Vulcan blasts Havok into a sun  Vulcan decides to use Finality to destroy the Scy ar by using the weapon to place a star in the middle of their fleet  Alex returns and  having absorbed enough power to burn Vulcan  decides to end things with him  While they battle  Rachel and Korvus try  and fail  to stop the beacon that will initiate the attack by the Shi ar  The Shi ar Imperial Guard end Alex s battle with Vulcan by appearing with the Starjammers in captivity  threatening to kill them  Before surrendering  Alex destroys Finality  Alex and the Starjammers are then taken into Vulcan s custody and placed in a prison  while Rachel Summers remains free   edit  Divided We Stand Alex and Lorna along with the other captured Starjammers are kept in a deep underwater prison 20 miles  32 km  below a planet s surface  Alex and Lorna are tortured daily and forced to hear each other s screams  and Alex is powerless as he s nowhere near a star to draw his powers from  Vulcan informs Havok of the events of Messiah Complex and that the baby is gone  Charles Xavier is dead and the X Men are no more  not knowing the full truth of the result   Alex laughs off Vulcan  seeing the baby as a beacon of hope   edit  X Men  Kingbreaker and War of Kings Despite ploys such as telling Havok that his teammates are dead and it was all Alex s fault  Havok remains defiant  Alex Summers was last seen displaying energy coming from his left hand proving that he had at least some power left  23  Havok allowed some time to go by  allegedly with these moments of exposure continuing  before making his move  Waiting until it was his meal time  as the guards slid the food through the door  he blasted it open  Warning the guards to run  when they instead attacked he mercilessly defeated them  killing both  Alex then raced into the depths of the Complex searching for his teammates  He had no problem locating the cells of his crew and liberating them from captivity  He then went in search of Lorna  defeating more guards along the way  Alex  with Raza and Ch od in tow made it to Lorna s lab where Alex set her free  After receiving a thank you kiss upon waking her  Havok surprised his team as he informed them of his true plan  Instead of running they would wait  Gabriel would be coming to them to defeat them  and Havok planned to kill him when he did  24  Marvel has announced that Havok will play a large role in the upcoming sequel to Emperor Vulcan called X Men  Kingbreaker  25  He will also be seen prominently in the War of Kings storyline  which also features Vulcan  the Inhumans  Nova  the Starjammers and the Guardians of the Galaxy  26  27   edit  Realm of Kings Due to the incident of Rachel and Korvus both losing the connection to the Phoenix Force  Havok  Polaris  Rachel and Korvus have departed for Earth  28  According to Rachel  they are still  half a universe away  from Earth  volume  amp  issue needed  Havok  Polaris  and Rachel return in X Men Legacy  254  in which Rogue launches a rescue mission after Rachel sends a telepathic distress signal  29   edit  Regenesis Havok along with Polaris are seen joining Wolverine s side due to Polaris wanting to maintain her self away from her father Magneto  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Powers and abilities Havok is a mutant possessing the power to absorb ambient cosmic energy  process it and emanate it from his body as waves of energy that heat the air in the path  turning it into plasma in the form of a blast or discharge  with a tell tale concentric circle pattern  These waves will emanate from his body in all directions unless he purposefully tries to channel them in a single direction  usually along the length of his arms  This results in control over an extremely powerful sort of destructive force  He is immune to the adverse effects of most forms of radiation and heat  In the past  he was not entirely able to control this ability  which made him a danger to those around him unless he wore a special containment suit equipped with special sensors for measuring and controlling his power output  Havok is immune to his own powers and to those of his brother Scott  He is resistant but not immune to Vulcan s powers  Despite past accounts  the energy that Havok releases is not truly a concussive force  When Havok strikes an object with hot plasma  the sudden temperature jump often causes objects to shatter or disintegrate  Should Havok direct his energy at the lowest level  he can project it towards a human being and his target will suffer a severe headache  but will not burn up  He can absorb cosmic energy from his environment  such as starlight  x rays  and gamma radiation  and store them in his cells  metabolizing the energy to generate plasma wave discharges that super heat and disintegrate objects  His absorption is normally passive  but he has shown that he can actively drain and absorb energy as well  Havok s body is constantly absorbing cosmic radiation  When his body reaches its capacity  excess energy is then immediately re emitted in negligible quantities  The circle on his chest is an indicator as how much energy he has left  Upon the expenditure of all his available energy  it takes Havok about 17 hours to recharge to peak level  The concentration involved in releasing his energy in focused beams is exhausting for Havok  especially if he does it over an extended period  Havok has the normal human strength  height  and build of a man who engages in intensive regular exercise  Havok is well educated in the field of geophysical science where he has earned a masters degree and completed some doctoral work  and he has been trained in hand to hand combat and martial arts by Wolverine  He is an instinctive tactician and strategist  It was also revealed  in the Mutant X and Exiles books that his body and mind were a nexus for all other Alex Summers in other realities and his very existence is sort of a  back door  to the others  This revelation caused the problem in the Uncanny X Men and Exiles crossover  Not much more is known about his multidimensional status   edit  Other versions  edit  Age of Apocalypse In the Age of Apocalypse continuity  Alex and his brother Scott are not separated after the plane crash  but adopted together by Sinister  Raised together as the cream of the new mutant aristocracy in Apocalypse s America  the brothers  under the rank of Prelate  work to oversee their foster father s interests  Alex  being the more emotional  and thus unstable  of the two  loses ground in Sinister s eyes and watches with envy as his brother gains favor  30  The two brothers reunite briefly with their real father  Christopher Summers  who has been kept in Sinister s medical labs  They discover that Christopher been infected by the Brood and was transforming into the new Brood Queen  forcing Scott to kill him  Alex refuses to believe that there were no other options and blames his brother for their father s death  31  Alex meets Lorna once  but they have no relationship other than that of jail warden and prisoner  The power hungry Alex is arrogant of his powers both as a mutant and as a Prelate  He frequents the club which Angel owns  Heaven  and has an affair with the club s diva  a flatscan  or human  woman named Scarlett  presumably that reality s version of the woman who appeared in the Meltdown miniseries   Because of the antagonism between humans and mutants  they both must keep this affair a secret  Scarlett  it turns out  is a spy working for the Human High Council  Scarlett is arrested right after she discovers that she is pregnant with Alex s child  32  At almost that moment  Alex has just recaptured Jean Grey to use against his brother  Scott  Indeed  when Jean was originally a prisoner  she had captivated Scott and inspired him to release other prisoners  Alex exposes his brother as a traitor by asking Scott to execute Jean Grey  which Scott refuses to do  Following this  Alex has Scott arrested and gives him over to the Dark Beast for experiments  however  Jean Grey and Scott escape  Alex tracks them down and knocks his brother and seemingly kills Jean  but this action proves fatal for Alex when Weapon X takes vengeance on Jean s behalf  33   edit  Marvel Zombies Ultimate Fantastic Four In Ultimate Fantastic Four  23  Havok is seen as one of the zombies attacking the surviving humans  34   edit  Mys Tech Wars In the four issue series Mys Tech Wars an alternate universe version of Havok  along with the rest of X Factor  appear in order to assist the mainstream heroes in their battles  An enemy s energy bolt pierces Havok through the neck  killing him instantly  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  New Exiles On the world of the Sons of Iron and Daughters of the Dragon  the New Exiles face a squad of alternate  core X Men  who are loyal to Lilandra  These X Men include an alternate version of Alex who is codenamed  Warshot   Alex is covered from head to toe in battle armor and appears to combine his mutant powers with his weaponry  35   edit  Ultimate Havok In the Ultimate Marvel continuity of Ultimate X Men  Alex Summers  a k a  Havok  is the headstrong  brash field leader of the Academy of Tomorrow  the mutant peacekeeping squad of Emma Frost  In this incarnation  he is the boyfriend and teammate of Polaris  In this incarnation  he also is the brother of Cyclops  As in the mainstream comics  their powers are useless on each other  However  there are several key differences  first  Alex is sometimes called the older brother and other times called the younger brother  second  in this world  Alex and Scott are frequently at odds with each other  both ideologically and physically  and third  neither seems interested in mending this rift  Ideologically  their rift was evidenced by Alex s affiliation with Emma Frost s Academy of Tomorrow  There is also more than one reference to their physical competition over Polaris  volume  amp  issue needed  In one case  Alex even knocked out Scott with a wrench  though he states that this was because Scott let him  volume  amp  issue needed  The two have shown to help each other in great danger  but in general  they have a lot of sibling issues separating them  During the Ultimatum event  Alex wasn t among his team mates of Academy of Tomorrow when all were killed by Madrox  and is listed as missing in action after end of the event  36  Alex is later revealed to be alive and is now a patient in a mental facility  37   edit  X Men  The End In the alternate future X Men  The End  Carter creates an illusion that he is still a child and Havok and Annie are together  Both Havok and Annie are killed prior to the beginning of the series  38   edit  In other media  edit  Television Havok guest starred in the X Men animated series episode  Cold Comfort   He appears as a member of X Factor and revealed to be romantically involved with Iceman s ex girlfriend Lorna Dane  not called Polaris   In the episode X Factor fights against the X Men for a  friendly skirmish   as Forge puts it  When face to face  Cyclops and Havok never acknowledge each other as brothers  They  in fact  express genuine surprise that their powers can t affect the other  a fact carried over from the comics  and it is implied that they do not know they are brothers  They form a quick rivalry  however  In the episode  Orphan s End   a flashback shows a young Alex with his brother and parents  In the episode  Days of Future Past  Part 2   during a montage of Bishop s future  Havok is briefly seen fighting Sentinels alongside Cyclops  Interestingly  Havok s voice actor in the episode  Cold Comfort  is uncredited  Havok also appeared in the X Men  Evolution animated series voiced by Matt Hill  In the series  he was adopted by the Masters family rather than the Blanding family as in the comics and was portrayed as a stereotypical long haired surfer even with the stereotypical surfer accent and vernacular  Though  like in the comics  he was separated from his brother after escaping the plane they were in that was about to crash  Unlike the other X Men animated series  however  in X Men Evolution  Scott and Alex do develop a bond  though Alex still declined full time membership in the X Men to pursue a career as a professional surfer  Alex manifests his powers here as simple red energy blasts rather than as the massively powerful circular power signature from the comics  In the series  he first appeared in the two part Season 1 finale  The Cauldron  and like his brother and other mutants  his mutant powers were fully evolved  as Magneto put it  by the Gem of Cyttorak  which  in the series  had slightly different origins  amp  abilities than in the comics  As a result  both he and his brother were transformed into adult versions with white hair and mastery over their powers  which  beyond taking away the pain Alex felt because of his own powers  also allowed his brother to open his eyes without the need for protective glasses  It was in this same episode that Magneto gave him the codename Havok as one of his Acolytes  though this was a brief position as he realized  as did his brother  that Magneto was using them to achieve his goals  As the result  both of them assisted X Men in his defeat and the destruction of Asteroid M  Afterward  like many mutants affected by the Gem of Cyttorak  the effects wore off  bringing Alex and his brother back to normal returning both their pains caused by their powers  Beyond his first appearance in the series  Havok only appears significantly in one other episode and briefly in four others  the last two of which were the two part series finale where he aided in the defeat of Apocalypse and his Horsemen  citation needed  Havok is mentioned in the Wolverine and the X Men episode  Breakdown   Similar to the comics  Alex and Scott s parents were lost in a plane crash  in which the brothers were the survivors  Scott fell into a coma for two years  while Alex was adopted   edit  Film Actor Lucas Till played Havok in X Men  First Class  39  According to executive producer Bryan Singer  Havok was not portrayed as Cyclops  brother in the film but  somehow  was  related to him in a way that works for the film   40   edit  Video

 He has joined forces with the Brotherhood  much to Cyclops  chagrin  Discovering that mutants are being experimented on in the abandoned Weapon X labs  he contacts his brother to secretly meet up with him to check it out  Cyclops initially fights it out with Havok  until Wolverine  having also come to investigate due to his ties to Weapon X  breaks things up  Together the three attack the labs
