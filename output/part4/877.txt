of Bono  vocals and guitar   The Edge  guitar  keyboards and vocals   Adam Clayton  bass guitar   and Larry Mullen  Jr   drums and percussion   U2 s early sound was rooted in post punk but eventually grew to incorporate influences from many genres of popular music  Throughout the group s musical pursuits  they have maintained a sound built on melodic instrumentals  highlighted by The Edge s textural guitar playing and Bono s expressive vocals  Their lyrics  often embellished with spiritual imagery  focus on personal themes and sociopolitical concerns  U2 formed at Mount Temple Comprehensive School when the members were teenagers with limited musical proficiency  Within four years  they signed with Island Records and released their debut album Boy  By the mid 1980s  they became a top international act  They were more successful as live performers than they were at selling records  until their breakthrough 1987 album The Joshua Tree  1  which  according to Rolling Stone  elevated the band s stature  from heroes to superstars   2  Reacting to musical stagnation and late 1980s criticism of their earnest image and musical direction  the group reinvented themselves with their 1991 hit album Achtung Baby and the accompanying Zoo TV Tour  U2 integrated dance  industrial  and alternative rock influences into their sound and performances  and embraced a more ironic and self deprecating image  Similar experimentation continued for the remainder of the 1990s with mixed levels of success  U2 regained critical and commercial favour after their 2000 record All That You Can t Leave Behind  On it and the group s subsequent releases  they adopted a more conventional sound while maintaining influences from their earlier musical explorations  U2 have released 12 studio albums and are among the all time best selling music artists  having sold more than 150 million records worldwide  They have won 22 Grammy Awards  more than any other band  and in 2005  they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility  Rolling Stone ranked U2 at number 22 in its list of the  100 Greatest Artists of All Time   3  Throughout their career  as a band and as individuals  they have campaigned for human rights and philanthropic causes  including Amnesty International  the ONE DATA campaigns  Product Red  and The Edge s Music Rising

4 Larry Mullen  Jr   then a 14 year old student at Mount Temple Comprehensive School  posted a note on the school s notice board in search of musicians for a new band six people responded  Setting up in his kitchen  Mullen was on drums  with Paul Hewson  Bono  on lead vocals  David Evans  The Edge  and his older brother Dik Evans on guitar  Adam Clayton  a friend of the Evans brothers on bass guitar  and initially Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin  two other friends of Mullen  5  Mullen later described it as   The Larry Mullen Band  for about ten minutes  then Bono walked in and blew any chance I had of being in charge   Soon after  the group settled on the name  Feedback  because it was one of the few technical terms they knew  6  Martin did not return after the first practice  and McCormick left the group within a few weeks  Most of the group s initial material consisted of cover songs  which the band admitted was not their fort   7  Some of the earliest influences on the band were emerging punk rock acts  such as The Jam  The Clash  The Buzzcocks  and The Sex Pistols  The popularity of punk rock convinced the group that musical proficiency was not a prerequisite to being successful  8   We couldn t believe it  I was completely shocked  We weren t of an age to go out partying as such but I don t think anyone slept that night     Really  it was just a great affirmation to win that competition  even though I ve no idea how good we were or what the competition was really like  But to win at that point was incredibly important for morale and everyone s belief in the whole project     The Edge  on winning the CBS competition 9  In March 1977  the band changed their name to The Hype  10  Dik Evans  who was older and by this time at college  was becoming the odd man out  The rest of the band was leaning towards the idea of a four piece ensemble and he was  phased out  in March 1978  During a farewell concert in the Presbyterian Church Hall in Howth  which featured The Hype playing covers  Dik ceremonially walked offstage  The remaining four band members completed the concert playing original material as  U2   11  Steve Averill  a punk rock musician and family friend of Clayton s  had suggested six potential names from which the band chose  U2  for its ambiguity and open ended interpretations  and because it was the name that they disliked the least  12  On Saint Patrick s Day in 1978  U2 won a talent show in Limerick  Ireland  The prize consisted of  500 and studio time to record a demo which would be heard by CBS Ireland  a record label  This win was an important milestone and affirmation for the fledgling band  11  U2 recorded their first demo tape at Keystone Studios in Dublin in May 1978  13 Hot Press magazine was influential in shaping the band s future  in May  Paul McGuinness  who had earlier been introduced to the band by the publication s journalist Bill Graham  agreed to be U2 s manager  14  The group s first release  an Ireland only EP entitled Three  was released in September 1979 and was their first Irish chart success  15  In December 1979  U2 performed in London for their first shows outside Ireland  although they were unable to gain much attention from audiences or critics  16  In February 1980  their second single  Another Day  was released on the CBS label  but again only for the Irish market  17   edit  Boy  October  and War  1980 83  Island Records signed U2 in March 1980  and in May the band released  11 O Clock Tick Tock  as their first international single  18  The band s debut album  Boy  followed in October  Produced by Steve Lillywhite  it received generally positive reviews  19  Although Bono s unfocused lyrics seemed improvised  they expressed a common theme  the dreams and frustrations of adolescence  20  The album included the band s first United States hit single   I Will Follow   Boy s release was followed by the Boy Tour  U2 s first tour of continental Europe and the United States  21  Despite being unpolished  these early live performances demonstrated U2 s potential  as critics noted that Bono was a  charismatic  and  passionate  showman  22  The band s second album  October  was released in 1981 and contained overtly spiritual themes  During the album s recording sessions  Bono and The Edge considered quitting the band due to perceived spiritual conflicts  23  Bono  The Edge  and Mullen had joined a Christian group in Dublin called the  Shalom Fellowship   which led them to question the relationship between the Christian faith and the rock and roll lifestyle  24  Bono and The Edge took time off between tours and decided to leave Shalom in favour of continuing with the band  Recording was further complicated with the theft of a briefcase containing lyrics for several working songs from backstage during the band s performance at a nightclub in Portland  Oregon  25  The album received mixed reviews and limited radio play  Low sales outside the UK put pressure on their contract with Island and focused the band on improvement  26   Sunday Bloody Sunday   1983   Sunday Bloody Sunday  features a martial drumbeat  raw guitar  and lyrically  a bleak emotionally charged response to violence  Problems listening to this file  See media help  Resolving their doubts of the October period  U2 released War in 1983  27  A record where the band  turned pacifism itself into a crusade   28 War s sincerity and  rugged  guitar was intentionally at odds with the  cooler  synthpop of the time  29  The album included the politically charged  Sunday Bloody Sunday   where Bono had lyrically tried to contrast the events of Bloody Sunday with Easter Sunday  30 Rolling Stone magazine wrote that the song showed the band was capable of deep and meaningful songwriting  War was U2 s first album to feature the photography of Anton Corbijn  who remains U2 s principal photographer and has had a major influence on their vision and public image  31  U2 s first commercial success  War debuted at number one in the UK  and its first single   New Year s Day   was the band s first hit outside Ireland or the UK  32  Bono performs in Norway during the War Tour in 1983  On the subsequent War Tour  the band performed sold out concerts in mainland Europe and the US  The sight of Bono waving a white flag during performances of  Sunday Bloody Sunday  became the tour s iconic image  33  U2 recorded the Under a Blood Red Sky live album on this tour  as well as the Live at Red Rocks concert film  both of which received extensive play on the radio and MTV  expanding the band s audience and showcasing their prowess as a live act  34  Their record deal with Island Records was coming to an end  and in 1984 the band signed a more lucrative extension  They negotiated the return of their copyrights  so that they owned the rights to their own songs   an increase in their royalty rate  and a general improvement in terms  at the expense of a larger initial payment  35   edit  The Unforgettable Fire and Live Aid  1984 85   We knew the world was ready to receive the heirs to The Who  All we had to do was to keep doing what we were doing and we would become the biggest band since Led Zeppelin  without a doubt  But something just didn t feel right  We felt we had more dimension than just the next big anything  we had something unique to offer     Bono  on The Unforgettable Fire s new direction  36  The Unforgettable Fire was released in 1984  Ambient and abstract  it was at the time the band s most marked change in direction  37  The band feared that following the overt rock of the War album and tour  they were in danger of becoming another  shrill    sloganeering arena rock band   38  Thus  experimentation was sought  39  as Adam Clayton recalls   We were looking for something that was a bit more serious  more arty   36  The Edge admired the ambient and  weird works  of Brian Eno  who  along with his engineer Daniel Lanois  eventually agreed to produce the record  40  The Unforgettable Fire has a rich and orchestrated sound  Under Lanois  direction  Mullen s drumming became looser  funkier  and more subtle and Clayton s bass became more subliminal  the rhythm section no longer intruded  but flowed in support of the songs  41  Complementing the sonic atmospherics  the album s lyrics are open to many interpretations  providing what the band called a  very visual feel   37  Due to a tight recording schedule  however  Bono felt songs like  Bad  and  Pride  In the Name of Love   were incomplete  sketches   42   Pride  In the Name of Love    about Martin Luther King  Jr   was the album s first single and became the band s biggest hit to that point  including being their first to enter the US top 40  43   The Unforgettable Fire   1984   The Unforgettable Fire  has a rich  symphonic sound built from ambient instrumentation  a driving rhythm  and a lyrical  sketch   44  Much of The Unforgettable Fire Tour moved into indoor arenas as U2 began to win their long battle to build their audience  45  The complex textures of the new studio recorded tracks  such as  The Unforgettable Fire  and  Bad   were problematic to translate to live performances  37  One solution was programmed sequencers  which the band had previously been reluctant to use  but are now used in the majority of the band s performances  37  Songs on the album had been criticised as being  unfinished    fuzzy   and  unfocused   but were better received by critics when played on stage  46  U2 participated in the Live Aid concert for Ethiopian famine relief at Wembley Stadium in July 1985  47  U2 s performance in front of 82 000 fans was a pivotal point in the band s career  48  During a 14 minute performance of the song  Bad   Bono leapt down off the stage to embrace and dance with a fan  showing a television audience of millions the personal connection that Bono could make with audiences  49  In 1985  Rolling Stone magazine called U2 the  Band of the  80s   saying that  for a growing number of rock and roll fans  U2 have become the band that matters most  maybe even the only band that matters   35   edit  The Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum  1986 89   The wild beauty  cultural richness  spiritual vacancy and ferocious violence of America are explored to compelling effect in virtually every aspect of The Joshua Tree in the title and the cover art  the blues and country borrowings evident in the music     Indeed  Bono says that  dismantling the mythology of America  is an important part of The Joshua Tree s artistic objective     Anthony DeCurtis 50  Realising that  U2 had no tradition  and that their knowledge of music from before their childhood was limited  the group delved into American and Irish roots music  51  Friendships with Bob Dylan  Van Morrison  and Keith Richards motivated the band to explore blues  folk  and gospel music and focused Bono on his skills as a songwriter and lyricist  52  For their fifth album  The Joshua Tree  53  the band wanted to build on The Unforgettable Fire s textures  but instead of out of focus experimentation  they sought a harder hitting sound that used the limitation of strict song structures  54  U2 interrupted their 1986 album sessions to serve as a headline act on Amnesty International s A Conspiracy of Hope tour  Rather than being a distraction  the tour added extra intensity and focus to their new material  55  In 1986  Bono travelled to San Salvador and Nicaragua and saw first hand the distress of peasants bullied in internal conflicts that were subject to American political intervention  The experience became a central influence on the new music  56  The tree pictured on The Joshua Tree album sleeve  Adam Clayton said   The desert was immensely inspirational to us as a mental image for this record   57  The Joshua Tree was released in March 1987  The album juxtaposes antipathy towards America against the group s deep fascination with the country  its open spaces  freedom  and ideals  58  The band wanted music with a sense of location and a  cinematic  quality  and the record s music and lyrics draw on imagery created by American writers whose works the band had been reading  59 The Joshua Tree became the fastest selling album in British chart history  and topped the Billboard 200 in the United States for nine consecutive weeks  60  The first two singles   With or Without You  38  and  I Still Haven t Found What I m Looking For   quickly became the group s first number one hits in the US  They became the fourth rock band to be featured on the cover of Time magazine  61  which declared U2  Rock s Hottest Ticket   62  The album won U2 their first two Grammy Awards  63  and it brought the band a new level of success  Many publications  including Rolling Stone  have cited it as one of rock s greatest  64 The Joshua Tree Tour was the first tour on which the band played shows in stadiums  alongside smaller arena shows  65  The documentary Rattle and Hum featured footage recorded from The Joshua Tree Tour  and the accompanying double album of the same name included nine studio tracks and six live U2 performances  Released in October 1988  the album and film were intended as a tribute to American music  66  and included recordings at Sun Studios in Memphis and performances with Bob Dylan and B  B  King  Rattle and Hum performed modestly at the box office and received mixed reviews from both film and music critics  67  one Rolling Stone editor spoke of the album s  excitement   another described it as  bombastic and misguided   68  The film s director  Phil Joanou  described it as  an overly pretentious look at U2   69  Most of the album s new material was played on 1989 s Lovetown Tour  which visited Australia  Japan and Europe  because the band wanted to avoid the American backlash  In addition  they had grown dissatisfied with their live performances  Mullen recalled that  We were the biggest  but we weren t the best   70  With a sense of musical stagnation  Bono said to fans on one of the last dates of the tour that it was  the end of something for U2  and that they had to  go away and       just dream it all up again   71   edit  Achtung Baby  Zoo TV  and Zooropa  1990 93   Buzzwords on this record were trashy  throwaway  dark  sexy  and industrial  all good  and earnest  polite  sweet  righteous  rockist and linear  all bad   It was good if a song took you on a journey or made you think your hifi was broken  bad if it reminded you of recording studios or U2       Brian Eno  on the recording of Achtung Baby 72  Stung by the criticism of Rattle and Hum  the band sought to transform themselves musically  73  Seeking inspiration on the eve of German reunification  they began work on Achtung Baby at Hansa Studios in Berlin in October 1990 with producers Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno  74  The sessions were fraught with conflict  as the band argued over their musical direction and the quality of their material  While Clayton and Mullen preferred a sound similar to U2 s previous work  Bono and The Edge were inspired by European industrial music and electronic dance music and advocated a change  Weeks of tension and slow progress nearly took their toll  as the group considered breaking up  but they made a breakthrough with the improvised writing of the song  One   75  They returned to Dublin in 1991  where morale improved and the majority of the album was completed   The Fly   1991   The Fly  features hip hop beats  distorted vocals  and a hard industrial edge that differed from U2 s typical sound  76  In November 1991  U2 released Achtung Baby  The album represented a calculated change in musical and thematic direction for the group  the shift was one of their most dramatic since The Unforgettable Fire  77  Sonically  the record incorporated influences from alternative rock  dance  and industrial music of the time  and the band referred to its musical departure as  four men chopping down the Joshua Tree   78  Thematically  it was a more introspective and personal record  it was darker  yet at times more flippant than the band s previous work  Commercially and critically  it has been one of the band s most successful albums  It produced five hit singles  including  The Fly    Mysterious Ways   and  One   and it was a crucial part of the band s early 1990s reinvention  79  Like The Joshua Tree  many publications have cited the record as one of rock s greatest  64  The Zoo TV Tour was a multimedia intensive event  featuring a stage that used dozens of video screens  Like Achtung Baby  the 1992 1993 Zoo TV Tour was an unequivocal break with the band s past  In contrast to the austere stage setups of previous U2 tours  Zoo TV was an elaborate multimedia event  It satirised the pervasive nature of television and its blurring of news  entertainment  and home shopping by attempting to instill  sensory overload  in its audience  78  80  81  The stage featured large video screens that showed visual effects  random video clips from pop culture  and flashing text phrases  82  Whereas U2 were known for their earnest performances in the 1980s  the group s Zoo TV performances were intentionally ironic and self deprecating  78  on stage  Bono performed as several over the top characters  including  The Fly   83   Mirror Ball Man   and  MacPhisto   84  Prank phone calls were made to President Bush  the United Nations  and others  Live satellite link ups to war torn Sarajevo caused controversy  85  Quickly recorded during a break in the Zoo TV Tour in mid 1993  the Zooropa album continued many of the themes from Achtung Baby and the Zoo TV Tour  Initially intended as an EP  the band expanded Zooropa into a full length LP album  It was an even greater departure from the style of their earlier recordings  incorporating further dance influences and other electronic effects  86 Johnny Cash sang the lead vocals on  The Wanderer   Most of the songs were played at least once during the 1993 legs of the tour  which visited Europe  Australia  New Zealand and Japan  half the album s tracks became permanent fixtures in the setlist  87  Although the commercially successful  Zooropa  won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album  the band regards the album with mixed feelings  because they felt it was more of  an interlude    edit  Passengers  Pop  and PopMart  1994 99  In 1995  U2 released an experimental album called Original Soundtracks 1  Brian Eno  producer of three previous U2 albums  contributed as a full partner  including writing and performing  For this reason and due to the record s highly experimental nature  the band chose to release it under the moniker  Passengers  to distinguish it from U2 s conventional albums  Mullen said of the album   There s a thin line between interesting music and self indulgence  We crossed it on the Passengers record   88  It was commercially unnoticed by U2 standards and it received generally poor reviews  However  the single  Miss Sarajevo  featuring Luciano Pavarotti  which Bono cites as one of his favourite U2 songs  89  was successful   It s not enough to write a great lyric  it s not enough to have a good idea or a great hook  lots of things have to come together and then you have to have the ability to discipline and screen  We should give this album to a re mixer  go back to what was originally intended       Bono  on Pop 90  On 1997 s Pop  U2 continued experimenting  tape loops  programming  rhythm sequencing  and sampling provided much of the album with heavy  funky dance rhythms  91  Released in March  the album debuted at number one in 35 countries and drew mainly positive reviews  92 Rolling Stone  for example  stated that U2 had  defied the odds and made some of the greatest music of their lives   93  Others felt that the album was a major disappointment and sales were poor compared to previous U2 releases  94  The band was hurried into completing the album in time for the impending pre booked tour  and Bono admitted that the album  didn t communicate the way it was intended to   95  The PopMart Tour stage featured a golden arch  mirrorball lemon  and  at the time  the largest LED screen in the world  The subsequent tour  PopMart  commenced in April 1997  Like Zoo TV  it poked fun at pop culture and was intended to send a sarcastic message to those accusing U2 of commercialism  The stage included a 100 foot  30 m  tall golden yellow arch  reminiscent of the McDonald s logo   a 150 foot  46 m  long video screen  and a 40 foot  12 m  tall mirrorball lemon  U2 s  big shtick  failed  however  to satisfy many who were seemingly confused by the band s new kitsch image and elaborate sets  96  The postponement of Pop s release date in order to complete the album meant rehearsal time for the tour was severely reduced  and performances in early shows suffered  97  A highlight of the tour was the concert in Sarajevo where U2 were the first major group to perform there following the Bosnian War  98  Mullen described the concert as  an experience I will never forget for the rest of my life  and if I had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show  and have done that  I think it would have been worthwhile   99  Bono called the show  one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life   100  One month after the conclusion of the PopMart Tour  U2 appeared on the 200th episode of the animated sitcom The Simpsons   Trash of the Titans   in which Homer Simpson disrupted the band on stage during a PopMart concert  101   edit   Reapplying for the job of the best band in the world   2000 06  U2 perform during the Elevation Tour in Kansas City  2001  Following the relatively disappointing reception of Pop  U2 declared they were  reapplying for the job      of  the best band in the world   102  and they have since pursued a more conventional rock sound mixed with the influences of their 1990s musical explorations  103 All That You Can t Leave Behind was released in October 2000 and was produced by Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois  For many of those not won over by the band s 1990s music  it was considered a return to grace  104 Rolling Stone called it U2 s  third masterpiece  alongside The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby  105  The album debuted at number one in 22 countries 106  and its worldwide hit single   Beautiful Day  earned three Grammy Awards  The album s other three singles also won Grammy Awards  For the Elevation Tour  U2 performed in a scaled down setting  returning to arenas after nearly a decade of stadium productions  A heart shaped stage and ramp permitted greater proximity to the audience  Following the 11 September attacks  the new album gained added resonance  64  107  and in October  U2 performed at Madison Square Garden in New York City  Bono and The Edge later said these New York City shows were among their most memorable and emotional performances  108  In early 2002  U2 performed during halftime of Super Bowl XXXVI  109  which SI com ranked as the best halftime show in Super Bowl history  110   Vertigo   2004   Vertigo   with its aggressive riff  became a hit worldwide and was used in a cross promotion with Apple  The band s next studio album  How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb  was released in November 2004  The band were looking for a harder hitting rock sound than All That You Can t Leave Behind  Thematically  Bono stated that  a lot of the songs are paeans to naivet   a rejection of knowingness   111  The first single   Vertigo   was featured on an internationally aired television commercial for the Apple iPod  and a U2 iPod and an iTunes U2 box set were released as part of a promotion with Apple  The album debuted at number one in the US  where the first week s sales doubled that of All That You Can t Leave Behind and set a record for the band  112  Claiming it as a contender as one of U2 s three best albums  Bono said   There are no weak songs  But as an album  the whole isn t greater than the sum of its parts  and it fucking annoys me   111  The Vertigo Tour featured a setlist that varied more across dates than any U2 tour since the Lovetown Tour  and it included songs not played since the early 1980s  Like the Elevation Tour  the Vertigo Tour was a commercial success  113  The album and its singles won Grammy Awards in all eight categories in which U2 were nominated  In 2005  Bruce Springsteen inducted U2 into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  114  A 3 D concert film  U2 3D  filmed at nine concerts during the Latin American and Australian legs of the Vertigo Tour was released on 23 January 2008  In August 2006  the band incorporated its publishing business in The Netherlands following the capping of Irish artists  tax exemption at  250 000  115  The Edge stated that businesses often seek to minimise their tax burdens  116  The move was criticised in the Irish parliament  116  117  The band said the criticism was unfair  stating that approximately 95  of their business took place outside of Ireland  that they were taxed globally because of this  and that they were all  personal investors and employers in the country   118  In March 2008  U2 signed a 12 year deal with Live Nation worth an estimated  100 million   50 million   119  which includes Live Nation controlling the band s merchandise  sponsoring  and their official website  120   edit  No Line on the Horizon and U2 360  Tour  2007 present  The stage structure from the U2 360  Tour  the largest ever constructed  allowed for a 360 degree seating configuration  Recording for U2 s twelfth album  No Line on the Horizon  began with producer Rick Rubin in 2006  but the sessions were short lived and the material was shelved  In June 2007  the band began new sessions with Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois  who contributed not only as producers  but for the first time with U2  as songwriters as well  121  Recording continued through December 2008 in the US  the UK  Ireland  and Fez  Morocco  where the band explored North African music  Intended as a more experimental work than their previous two albums  122 No Line on the Horizon was released in February 2009 and received generally positive reviews  including their first five star Rolling Stone review  Critics  however  noted it was not as experimental as expected  The album debuted at number one in over 30 countries  123  but the album s sales have been comparatively low by U2 standards and it did not contain a hit single  124  The group commenced the U2 360  Tour in 2009  The shows featured the largest concert stage structure ever  nicknamed  the Claw   and a 360 degree staging audience configuration that allowed fans to surround the stage from all sides  125  The tour visited European and North American stadiums in 2009  At year s end  Rolling Stone named U2 one of eight  Artists of the Decade   126  The group s tours ranked them second in total concert grosses for the decade after The Rolling Stones  although U2 had a significantly higher attendance figure than the Stones  They were the only band in the top 25 touring acts of the 2000s to sell out every show they played  127  U2 resumed the 360  Tour in 2010 with legs in Europe  Australia  and New Zealand  However  their scheduled headline appearance at the Glastonbury Festival 2010 and their North American leg that year were postponed following a serious injury to Bono s back  128  129  130  These appearances were rescheduled for 2011 after the South African and South American legs  131  The tour concluded in July 2011 with a final gross of  736 137 344  and a total attendance of 7 268 430  both record setting figures for a single concert tour  132   edit  Musical style  edit  Instrumentation U2 performing in 2009  The Edge has described U2 as a fundamentally live band  Since their inception  U2 have developed and maintained a distinctly recognisable sound  with emphasis on melodic instrumentals and expressive  larger than life vocals  133  This approach is rooted partly in the early influence of record producer Steve Lillywhite at a time when the band was not known for musical proficiency  134  The Edge has consistently used a rhythmic echo and a signature delay 135  to craft his guitar work  coupled with an Irish influenced drone played against his syncopated melodies 136  that ultimately yields a well defined ambient  chiming sound  Bono has nurtured his falsetto operatic voice 137  and has exhibited a notable lyrical bent towards social  political  and personal subject matter while maintaining a grandiose scale in his songwriting  In addition  The Edge has described U2 as a fundamentally live band  136  Despite these broad consistencies  U2 have introduced brand new elements into their musical repertoire with each new album  U2 s early sound was influenced by bands such as Television and Joy Division  and has been described as containing a  sense of exhilaration  that resulted from The Edge s  radiant chords  and Bono s  ardent vocals   138  U2 s sound began with post punk roots and minimalistic and uncomplicated instrumentals heard on Boy and October  but evolved through War to include aspects of rock anthem  funk  and dance rhythms to become more versatile and aggressive  139 Boy and War were labelled  muscular and assertive  by Rolling Stone  38  influenced in large part by Lillywhite s producing  The Unforgettable Fire  which began with The Edge playing more keyboards than guitars  as well as follow up The Joshua Tree  had Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois at the production helm  With their influence  both albums achieved a  diverse texture   38  The songs from The Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum placed more emphasis on Lanois inspired rhythm as they mixed distinct and varied styles of gospel and blues music  which stemmed from the band s burgeoning fascination with America s culture  people and places  In the 1990s  U2 reinvented themselves as they began using synthesisers  distortion  and electronic beats derived from alternative rock  industrial music  dance  and hip hop on Achtung Baby  140 Zooropa  and Pop  141  The 2000s had U2 returning to a stripped down sound  with a more traditional rhythm and less obvious use of synthesisers and effects  142   edit  Lyrics and themes Social and political commentary  often embellished with Christian and spiritual imagery  143  are a major aspect of U2 s lyrical content  Songs such as  Sunday Bloody Sunday    Silver and Gold   and  Mothers of the Disappeared  were motivated by current events of the time  The former was written about the troubles in Northern Ireland  144  while the latter concerns the struggle of a group of women whose children were killed or  disappeared  by the government during the Salvadoran Civil War  145  The song  Running to Stand Still  from The Joshua Tree was inspired by the heroin addiction that was sweeping through Dublin the lyric  I see seven towers  but I only see one way out  references the Ballymun Towers of Northern Dublin and the imagery throughout the song personifies the struggles of addiction  146  Bono s personal conflicts and turmoil inspired songs like  Mofo    Tomorrow  and  Kite   An emotional yearning or pleading frequently appears as a lyrical theme  133  in tracks such as  Yahweh   147   Peace on Earth   and  Please   Much of U2 s songwriting and music is also motivated by contemplations of loss and anguish  coupled with hopefulness and resiliency  themes that are central to The Joshua Tree  38  Some of these lyrical ideas have been amplified by Bono and the band s personal experiences during their youth in Ireland  as well as Bono s campaigning and activism later in his life  U2 have used tours such as Zoo TV and PopMart to caricature social trends  such as media overload and consumerism  respectively  141  While the band and its fans often affirm the political nature of their music  U2 s lyrics and music have been criticised as apolitical because of their vagueness and  fuzzy imagery   and a lack of any specific references to actual people or characters  148   edit  Influences The band cites The Who  149 The Clash  150 Television  Ramones  151 The Beatles  152 Joy Division  153 Siouxsie and the Banshees  154 Elvis Presley  155  and Patti Smith 156  as influences  Van Morrison has been cited by Bono as an influence 157  and his influence on U2 is pointed out by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  158  U2 have also worked and or had influential relationships with artists including Johnny Cash  Green Day  Leonard Cohen  Bruce Springsteen  B B  King  Lou Reed  Luciano Pavarotti  159 Bob Dylan  Elvis Costello  Wim Wenders  R E M   Salman Rushdie  and Anton Corbijn   edit  Campaigning and activism Bono with then President Luiz In cio Lula da Silva of Brazil  Since the early 1980s  the members of U2 as a band and individually have collaborated with other musicians  artists  celebrities  and politicians to address issues concerning poverty  disease  and social injustice  In 1984  Bono and Adam Clayton participated in Band Aid to raise money for the 1984 1985 famine in Ethiopia  This initiative produced the hit charity single  Do They Know It s Christmas    which would be the first among several collaborations between U2 and Bob Geldof  In July 1985  U2 played Live Aid  a follow up to Band Aid s efforts  Bono and his wife Ali  invited by World Vision  later visited Ethiopia where they witnessed the famine first hand  Bono would later say this laid the groundwork for his Africa campaigning and some of his songwriting  160  In 1986  U2 participated in the A Conspiracy of Hope tour in support of Amnesty International and in Self Aid for unemployment in Ireland  The same year  Bono and Ali Hewson also visited Nicaragua and El Salvador at the invitation of the Sanctuary movement  and saw the effects of the El Salvador Civil War  These 1986 events greatly influenced The Joshua Tree album  which was being recorded at the time  55  161  In 1992  the band participated in the  Stop Sellafield  concert with Greenpeace during their Zoo TV tour  162  Events in Sarajevo during the Bosnian war inspired the song  Miss Sarajevo   which premiered at a September 1995 Pavarotti and Friends show  and which Bono and the Edge performed at War Child  163  A promise made in 1993 was kept when the band played in Sarajevo as part of 1997 s PopMart Tour  164  In 1998  they performed in Belfast days prior to the vote on the Good Friday Agreement  bringing Northern Irish political leaders David Trimble and John Hume on stage to promote the agreement  165  Later that year  all proceeds from the release of the  Sweetest Thing  single went towards supporting the Chernobyl Children s Project  In 2001  the band dedicated  Walk On  to Burma s pro democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi  166  In late 2003  Bono and the Edge participated in the South Africa HIV AIDS awareness 46664 series of concerts hosted by Nelson Mandela  167  The band played 2005 s Live 8 concert in London  The band and manager Paul McGuinness were awarded Amnesty International s Ambassador of Conscience Award for their work in promoting human rights  168  Since 2000  Bono s campaigning has included Jubilee 2000 with Bob Geldof  Muhammad Ali  and others to promote the cancellation of third world debt during the Great Jubilee  In January 2002  Bono co founded the multinational NGO  DATA  with the aim of improving the social  political  and financial state of Africa  He continued his campaigns for debt and HIV AIDS relief into June 2002 by making high profile visits to Africa  169  Product Red  a 2006 for profit brand seeking to raise money for the Global Fund  was founded  in part  by Bono  The ONE Campaign  originally the US counterpart of Make Poverty History  was shaped by his efforts and vision  In late 2005  following Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita  The Edge helped introduce Music Rising  an initiative to raise funds for musicians who lost their instruments in the storm ravaged Gulf Coast  170  In 2006  U2 collaborated with punk pop band Green Day to record a remake of the song  The Saints Are Coming  by The Skids to benefit Music Rising  171  U2 and Bono s social activism have not been without its critics  however  Several authors and activists who publish in politically left journals such as CounterPunch have decried Bono s support of political figures such as Paul Wolfowitz  172  as well as his  essential paternalism   173  Other news sources have more generally questioned the efficacy of Bono s campaign to relieve debt and provide assistance to Africa  174  Tax and development campaigners have also criticised the band s move from Ireland to the Netherlands to reduce its tax bill  175   edit  Other projects The members of U2 have undertaken a number of side projects  sometimes in collaboration with some of their bandmates  In 1985  Bono recorded the song  In a Lifetime  with the Irish band Clannad  The Edge recorded a solo soundtrack album for the film Captive in 1986  176  which included a vocal performance by Sin ad O Connor that predates her own debut album by a year  Bono and The Edge wrote the song  She s a Mystery to Me  for Roy Orbison  which was featured on his 1989 album Mystery Girl  177  In 1990  Bono and The Edge provided the soundtrack to Royal Shakespeare Company London stage version of A Clockwork Orange  only one track was ever released  on the b side to  The Fly  single   That same year  Mullen co wrote and produced a song for the Irish International soccer team in Italia  90  called  Put  Em Under Pressure   which topped the Irish charts  Together with The Edge  Bono wrote the song  GoldenEye  for the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye  which was performed by Tina Turner  178  Clayton and Mullen reworked the title track of the movie Mission  Impossible in 1996  179  Bono loaned his voice to  Joy  on Mick Jagger s 2001 album Goddess in the Doorway  180  Bono also recorded a spare  nearly spoken word version of Leonard Cohen s  Hallelujah  for the Tower of Song compilation in 1995  Additionally  in 1998  Bono collaborated with Kirk Franklin and Crystal Lewis  along with controversial mainstream artists R  Kelly and Mary J  Blige  for a successful gospel song called  Lean on Me   Aside from musical collaborations  U2 have worked with several authors  American author William S  Burroughs had a guest appearance in U2 s video for  Last Night on Earth  shortly before he died  181  His poem  A Thanksgiving Prayer  was used as video footage during the band s Zoo TV Tour  Other collaborators include William Gibson and Allen Ginsberg  182  In early 2000  the band recorded three songs for The Million Dollar Hotel movie soundtrack  including  The Ground Beneath Her Feet   which was co written by Salman Rushdie and motivated by his book of the same name  183  In 2007 Bono appeared in the movie Across the Universe and performed The Beatles songs  Bono and The Edge also wrote the
