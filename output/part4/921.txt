education For more details on this topic  see Martin Luther King  Jr  authorship issues  Martin Luther King  Jr  was born on January 15  1929  in Atlanta  Georgia  the middle child of the Reverend Martin Luther King  Sr  and Alberta Williams King  5  King Jr  had an older sister  Willie Christine King  and a younger brother  Alfred Daniel Williams King  6  76 King sang with his church choir at the 1939 Atlanta premiere of the movie Gone with the Wind  7  King was originally skeptical of many of Christianity s claims  8  Most striking  perhaps  was his initial denial of the bodily resurrection of Jesus during Sunday school at the age of thirteen  From this point  he stated   doubts began to spring forth unrelentingly   9  However  he later concluded that the Bible has  many profound truths which one cannot escape  and decided to enter the seminary  8  Growing up in Atlanta  King attended Booker T  Washington High School  A precocious student  he skipped both the ninth and the twelfth grade and entered Morehouse College at age fifteen without formally graduating from high school  10  In 1948  he graduated from Morehouse with a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology  and enrolled in Crozer Theological Seminary in Chester  Pennsylvania  from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1951  11  12  King married Coretta Scott  on June 18  1953  on the lawn of her parents  house in her hometown of Heiberger  Alabama  13  They became the parents of four children  Yolanda King  Martin Luther King III  Dexter Scott King  and Bernice King  14  King became pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery  Alabama  when he was twenty five years old  in 1954  15  King then began doctoral studies in systematic theology at Boston University and received his Doctor of Philosophy on June 5  1955  with a dissertation on  A Comparison of the Conceptions of God in the Thinking of Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Wieman   A 1980s inquiry concluded portions of his dissertation had been plagiarized and he had acted improperly but that his dissertation still  makes an intelligent contribution to scholarship   16  17  18  Influences Thurman Civil rights leader  theologian  and educator Howard Thurman was an early influence on King  A classmate of King s father at Morehouse College  19  Thurman mentored the young King and his friends  20  Thurman s missionary work had taken him abroad where he had met and conferred with Mahatma Gandhi  21  When he was a student at Boston University  King often visited Thurman  who was the dean of Marsh Chapel  22  Walter Fluker  who has studied Thurman s writings  has stated   I don t believe you d get a Martin Luther King  Jr  without a Howard Thurman   23  Gandhi and Rustin With assistance from the Quaker group the American Friends Service Committee  and inspired by Gandhi s success with non violent activism  King visited Gandhi s birthplace in India in 1959  6  3 The trip to India affected King in a profound way  deepening his understanding of non violent resistance and his commitment to America s struggle for civil rights  In a radio address made during his final evening in India  King reflected   Since being in India  I am more convinced than ever before that the method of nonviolent resistance is the most potent weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for justice and human dignity  In a real sense  Mahatma Gandhi embodied in his life certain universal principles that are inherent in the moral structure of the universe  and these principles are as inescapable as the law of gravitation   6  135 6 African American civil rights activist Bayard Rustin had studied Gandhi s teachings  24  Rustin counseled King to dedicate himself to the principles of non violence  25  served as King s main advisor and mentor throughout his early activism  26  and was the main organizer of the 1963 March on Washington  27  Rustin s open homosexuality  support of democratic socialism  and his former ties to the Communist Party USA caused many white and African American leaders to demand King distance himself from Rustin  28  Public stance on political parties As the leader of the SCLC  King maintained a policy of not publicly endorsing a U S  political party or candidate   I feel someone must remain in the position of non alignment  so that he can look objectively at both parties and be the conscience of both not the servant or master of either   29  In a 1958 interview  he expressed his view that neither party was perfect  saying   I don t think the Republican party is a party full of the almighty God nor is the Democratic party  They both have weaknesses     And I m not inextricably bound to either party   30  King critiqued both parties  performance on promoting racial equality  Actually  the Negro has been betrayed by both the Republican and the Democratic party  The Democrats have betrayed him by capitulating to the whims and caprices of the Southern Dixiecrats  The Republicans have betrayed him by capitulating to the blatant hypocrisy of reactionary right wing northern Republicans  And this coalition of southern Dixiecrats and right wing reactionary northern Republicans defeats every bill and every move towards liberal legislation in the area of civil rights  31  Personal political advocacy Although King never publicly supported a political party or candidate for president  in a letter to a civil rights supporter in October 1956 he said that he was undecided as to whether he would vote for the Adlai Stevenson or Dwight Eisenhower  but that  In the past I always voted the Democratic ticket   32  In his autobiography  King says that in 1960 he privately voted for Democratic candidate John F  Kennedy   I felt that Kennedy would make the best president  I never came out with an endorsement  My father did  but I never made one   King adds that he likely would have made an exception to his non endorsement policy in 1964  saying  Had President Kennedy lived  I would probably have endorsed him in 1964   33  Sermons and speeches Main article  Sermons and speeches of Martin Luther King  Jr   I Have a Dream  30 second sample from  I Have a Dream  speech by Martin Luther King  Jr  Problems listening to this file  See media help  All I m saying is simply this  that all life is interrelated  that somehow we re caught in an inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny  Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly  For some strange reason  I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be  You can never be what you ought to be until I am what I ought to be  This is the interrelated structure of reality   Dr  Martin Luther King Jr  34  Throughout his career of service  King wrote and spoke frequently  drawing on his experience as a preacher  His  Letter from Birmingham Jail   written in 1963  is a  passionate  statement of his crusade for justice  35  His I Have a Dream speech is a 17 minute public speech delivered on August 28  1963  in which he called for racial equality and an end to discrimination  On October 14  1964  King became the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize  which was awarded to him for leading non violent resistance to racial prejudice in the United States  36  Montgomery Bus Boycott  1955 Main articles  Montgomery Bus Boycott  Jim Crow laws Public arena  Claudette Colvin  and Rosa Parks Rosa Parks with King  1955 In March 1955  a fifteen year old school girl  Claudette Colvin  refused to give up her bus seat to a white man in compliance with the Jim Crow laws  King was on the committee from the Birmingham African American community that looked into the case  because Colvin was pregnant and unmarried  E D  Nixon and Clifford Durr decided to wait for a better case to pursue  37  On December 1  1955  Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat  38  The Montgomery Bus Boycott  urged and planned by Nixon and led by King  soon followed  39  The boycott lasted for 385 days  40  and the situation became so tense that King s house was bombed  41  King was arrested during this campaign  which ended with a United States District Court ruling in Browder v  Gayle that ended racial segregation on all Montgomery public buses  6  9 42  53 Southern Christian Leadership Conference In 1957  King  Ralph Abernathy  and other civil rights activists founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference  SCLC   The group was created to harness the moral authority and organizing power of black churches to conduct non violent protests in the service of civil rights reform  King led the SCLC until his death  43  On September 20  1958  while signing copies of his book Stride Toward Freedom in Blumstein s department store on 125th Street  in Harlem  44  45  King was stabbed in the chest with a letter opener by Izola Curry  a deranged black woman  and narrowly escaped death  46  Lyndon Johnson and Robert Kennedy with Civil Rights leaders  June 22  1963 Gandhi s nonviolent techniques were useful to King s campaign to change the civil rights laws implemented in Alabama  47  King applied non violent philosophy to the protests organized by the SCLC  In 1959  he wrote The Measure of A Man  from which the piece What is Man   an attempt to sketch the optimal political  social  and economic structure of society  is derived  48  His SCLC secretary and personal assistant in this period was Dora McDonald  The FBI  under written directive from Attorney General Robert F  Kennedy  began telephone tapping King in the fall of 1963  49  Concerned that allegations  of Communists in the SCLC   if made public  would derail the Administration s civil rights initiatives  Kennedy warned King to discontinue the suspect associations  and later felt compelled to issue the written directive authorizing the FBI to wiretap King and other leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference  50  J Edgar Hoover feared Communists were trying to infiltrate the Civil Rights Movement  but when no such evidence emerged  the bureau used the incidental details caught on tape over the next five years in attempts to force King out of the preeminent leadership position  51  King believed that organized  nonviolent protest against the system of southern segregation known as Jim Crow laws would lead to extensive media coverage of the struggle for black equality and voting rights  Journalistic accounts and televised footage of the daily deprivation and indignities suffered by southern blacks  and of segregationist violence and harassment of civil rights workers and marchers  produced a wave of sympathetic public opinion that convinced the majority of Americans that the Civil Rights Movement was the most important issue in American politics in the early 1960s  52  53  King organized and led marches for blacks  right to vote  desegregation  labor rights and other basic civil rights  42  85 Most of these rights were successfully enacted into the law of the United States with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the 1965 Voting Rights Act  54  55  King and the SCLC put into practice many of the principles of the Christian Left and applied the tactics of nonviolent protest with great success by strategically choosing the method of protest and the places in which protests were carried out  There were often dramatic stand offs with segregationist authorities  Sometimes these confrontations turned violent  56  190 Albany movement Main article  Albany movement The Albany Movement was a desegregation coalition formed in Albany  Georgia in November 1961  In December  King and the SCLC became involved  The movement mobilized thousands of citizens for a broad front nonviolent attack on every aspect of segregation within the city and attracted nationwide attention  When King first visited on December 15  1961  he  had planned to stay a day or so and return home after giving counsel   9  page needed  But the following day he was swept up in a mass arrest of peaceful demonstrators  and he declined bail until the city made concessions   Those agreements   said King   were dishonored and violated by the city   as soon as he left town 9  page needed   King returned in July 1962  and was sentenced to forty five days in jail or a  178 fine  He chose jail  Three days into his sentence  Chief Pritchett discreetly arranged for King s fine to be paid and ordered his release   We had witnessed persons being kicked off lunch counter stools    ejected from churches    and thrown into jail    But for the first time  we witnessed being kicked out of jail   9  page needed  After nearly a year of intense activism with few tangible results  the movement began to deteriorate  King requested a halt to all demonstrations and a  Day of Penance  to promote non violence and maintain the moral high ground  Divisions within the black community and the canny  low key response by local government defeated efforts  56  190 3 However  it was credited as a key lesson in tactics for the national civil rights movement  57  Birmingham campaign Main article  Birmingham campaign The Birmingham campaign was a strategic effort by the SCLC to promote civil rights for African Americans  Many of its tactics of  Project C  were developed by Rev  Wyatt Tee Walker  Executive Director of SCLC from 1960 64  Based on actions in Birmingham  Alabama  its goal was to end the city s segregated civil and discriminatory economic policies  The campaign lasted for more than two months in the spring of 1963  To provoke the police into filling the city s jails to overflowing  King and black citizens of Birmingham employed nonviolent tactics to flout laws they considered unfair  King summarized the philosophy of the Birmingham campaign when he said   The purpose of     direct action is to create a situation so crisis packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation   58  Protests in Birmingham began with a boycott to pressure businesses to offer sales jobs and other employment to people of all races  as well as to end segregated facilities in the stores  When business leaders resisted the boycott  King and the SCLC began what they termed Project C  a series of sit ins and marches intended to provoke arrest  After the campaign ran low on adult volunteers  SCLC s strategist  James Bevel  initiated the action and recruited the children for what became known as the  Children s Crusade   During the protests  the Birmingham Police Department  led by Eugene  Bull  Connor  used high pressure water jets and police dogs to control protesters  including children  Not all of the demonstrators were peaceful  despite the avowed intentions of the SCLC  In some cases  bystanders attacked the police  who responded with force  King and the SCLC were criticized for putting children in harm s way  By the end of the campaign  King s reputation improved immensely  Connor lost his job  the  Jim Crow  signs in Birmingham came down  and public places became more open to blacks  59  St  Augustine  Florida  and Selma  Alabama King and SCLC were also driving forces behind the protest in St  Augustine  Florida  in 1964  60  The movement engaged in nightly marches in the city met by white segregationists who violently assaulted them  Hundreds of the marchers were arrested and jailed  King and the SCLC joined forces with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  SNCC  in Selma  Alabama  in December 1964  where SNCC had been working on voter registration for several months  61  A sweeping injunction issued by a local judge barred any gathering of 3 or more people under sponsorship of SNCC  SCLC  or DCVL  or with the involvement of 41 named civil rights leaders  This injunction temporarily halted civil rights activity until King defied it by speaking at Brown Chapel on January 2  1965  62  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom March on Washington  1963 Main article  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom King  representing SCLC  was among the leaders of the so called  Big Six  civil rights organizations who were instrumental in the organization of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom  which took place on August 28  1963  The other leaders and organizations comprising the Big Six were  Roy Wilkins from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  Whitney Young  National Urban League  A  Philip Randolph  Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters  John Lewis  SNCC  and James L  Farmer  Jr  of the Congress of Racial Equality  63  The primary logistical and strategic organizer was King s colleague Bayard Rustin  64  For King  this role was another which courted controversy  since he was one of the key figures who acceded to the wishes of President John F  Kennedy in changing the focus of the march  65  66  Kennedy initially opposed the march outright  because he was concerned it would negatively impact the drive for passage of civil rights legislation  but the organizers were firm that the march would proceed  67  King is most famous for his  I Have a Dream  speech  given in front of the Lincoln Memorial during the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom  The march originally was conceived as an event to dramatize the desperate condition of blacks in the southern United States and a very public opportunity to place organizers  concerns and grievances squarely before the seat of power in the nation s capital  Organizers intended to denounce and then challenge the federal government for its failure to safeguard the civil rights and physical safety of civil rights workers and blacks  generally  in the South  However  the group acquiesced to presidential pressure and influence  and the event ultimately took on a far less strident tone  68  As a result  some civil rights activists felt it presented an inaccurate  sanitized pageant of racial harmony  Malcolm X called it the  Farce on Washington   and the Nation of Islam forbade its members from attending the march  68  69   I Have a Dream  30 second sample from  I Have a Dream  speech by Martin Luther King  Jr  at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28  1963 Problems listening to this file  See media help  The march did  however  make specific demands  an end to racial segregation in public schools  meaningful civil rights legislation  including a law prohibiting racial discrimination in employment  protection of civil rights workers from police brutality  a  2 minimum wage for all workers  and self government for Washington  D C   then governed by congressional committee  70  71  72  Despite tensions  the march was a resounding success  More than a quarter million people of diverse ethnicities attended the event  sprawling from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial onto the National Mall and around the reflecting pool  At the time  it was the largest gathering of protesters in Washington s history  73  King s  I Have a Dream  speech electrified the crowd  It is regarded  along with Abraham Lincoln s Gettysburg Address and Franklin D  Roosevelt s Infamy Speech  as one of the finest speeches in the history of American oratory  74  The March  and especially King s speech  helped put civil rights at the very top of the liberal political agenda in the United States and facilitated passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964  75  76  Stance on compensation King giving a lecture on March 26  1964 Martin Luther King Jr  expressed a view that black Americans  as well as other disadvantaged Americans  should be compensated for historical wrongs  In an interview conducted for Playboy in 1965  he said that granting black Americans only equality could not realistically close the economic gap between them and whites  King said that he did not seek a full restitution of wages lost to slavery  which he believed impossible  but proposed a government compensatory program of  50 billion over ten years to all disadvantaged groups  He posited that  the money spent would be more than amply justified by the benefits that would accrue to the nation through a spectacular decline in school dropouts  family breakups  crime rates  illegitimacy  swollen relief rolls  rioting and other social evils   77  365 7 He presented this idea as an application of the common law regarding settlement of unpaid labor  but clarified that he felt that the money should not be spent exclusively on blacks  He stated   It should benefit the disadvantaged of all races   77  367 8  Bloody Sunday   1965 Main article  Selma to Montgomery marches The civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery  Alabama in 1965 King  James Bevel  and the SCLC  in partial collaboration with SNCC  attempted to organize a march from Selma to the state capital of Montgomery  for March 7  1965  The first attempt to march on March 7 was aborted because of mob and police violence against the demonstrators  This day has since become known as Bloody Sunday  Bloody Sunday was a major turning point in the effort to gain public support for the Civil Rights Movement  the clearest demonstration up to that time of the dramatic potential of King s nonviolence strategy  King  however  was not present  King met with officials in the Johnson administration on March 5 in order to request an injunction against any prosecution of the demonstrators  He did not attend the march due to church duties  but he later wrote   If I had any idea that the state troopers would use the kind of brutality they did  I would have felt compelled to give up my church duties altogether to lead the line   9  276 9 Footage of police brutality against the protesters was broadcast extensively and aroused national public outrage  42  222 3 King next attempted to organize a march for March 9  The SCLC petitioned for an injunction in federal court against the State of Alabama  this was denied and the judge issued an order blocking the march until after a hearing  Nonetheless  King led marchers on March 9 to the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma  then held a short prayer session before turning the marchers around and asking them to disperse so as not to violate the court order  The unexpected ending of this second march aroused the surprise and anger of many within the local movement  42  223 The march finally went ahead fully on March 25  1965  78  79  At the conclusion of the march and on the steps of the state capitol  King delivered a speech that has become known as  How Long  Not Long   80  Chicago  1966 King with President Lyndon Johnson in 1966 In 1966  after several successes in the South  King and others in the civil rights organizations tried to spread the movement to the North  with Chicago as its first destination  King and Ralph Abernathy  both from the middle class  moved into a building at 1550 S  Hamlin Ave   in the slums of North Lawndale 81  on the West Side of Chicago  as an educational experience and to demonstrate their support and empathy for the poor  82  360 2 The SCLC formed a coalition with CCCO  Coordinating Council of Community Organizations  an organization founded by Albert Raby  and the combined organizations  efforts were fostered under the aegis of The Chicago Freedom Movement  83  1 During that spring  several dual white couple black couple tests on real estate offices uncovered the practice  now banned in the U S   of racial steering  These tests revealed the racially selective processing of housing requests by couples who were exact matches in income  background  number of children  and other attributes  with the only difference being their race  82  347 The needs of the movement for radical change grew  and several larger marches were planned and executed  including those in the following neighborhoods  Bogan  Belmont Cragin  Jefferson Park  Evergreen Park  a suburb southwest of Chicago   Gage Park and Marquette Park among others  82  416 83  1 84  In Chicago  Abernathy later wrote that they received a worse reception than they had in the South  Their marches  especially the one through Marquette Park on August 5  1966  were met by thrown bottles and screaming throngs  and they were truly afraid of starting a riot  85  86  King s beliefs militated against his staging a violent event  and he negotiated an agreement with Mayor Richard J  Daley to cancel a march in order to avoid the violence that he feared would result from the demonstration  87  King  who received death threats throughout his involvement in the civil rights movement  was hit by a brick during one march but continued to lead marches in the face of personal danger  88  When King and his allies returned to the south  they left Jesse Jackson  a seminary student who had previously joined the movement in the South  in charge of their organization  89  Jackson continued their struggle for civil rights by organizing the Operation Breadbasket movement that targeted chain stores that did not deal fairly with blacks  90  Opposition to the Vietnam War See also  Opposition to the U S  involvement in the Vietnam War Starting in 1965  King began to express doubts about the United States  role in the Vietnam War  In an April 4  1967 appearance at the New York City Riverside Church exactly one year before his death King delivered a speech titled  Beyond Vietnam   91  He spoke strongly against the U S  s role in the war  insisting that the U S  was in Vietnam  to occupy it as an American colony  92  107 and calling the U S  government  the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today   92  102 He also argued that the country needed larger and broader moral changes  A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth  With righteous indignation  it will look across the seas and see individual capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia  Africa and South America  only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries  and say   This is not just   92  109 King also was opposed to the Vietnam War on the grounds that the war took money and resources that could have been spent on social welfare services like the War on Poverty  The United States Congress was spending more and more on the military and less and less on anti poverty programs at the same time  He summed up this aspect by saying   A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death   92  109 King s opposition cost him significant support among white allies  including President Johnson  union leaders and powerful publishers   The press is being stacked against me   King complained  93 Life magazine called the speech  demagogic slander that sounded like a script for Radio Hanoi   92  109 and The Washington Post declared that King had  diminished his usefulness to his cause  his country  his people   94  148 King stated that North Vietnam  did not begin to send in any large number of supplies or men until American forces had arrived in the tens of thousands   92  106 King also criticized the United States  resistance to North Vietnam s land reforms  95  He accused the United States of having killed a million Vietnamese   mostly children   96  The speech was a reflection of King s evolving political advocacy in his later years  which paralleled the teachings of the progressive Highlander Research and Education Center  with whom King was affiliated  97  98  King began to speak of the need for fundamental changes in the political and economic life of the nation  Towards the time of his murder  King more frequently expressed his opposition to the war and his desire to see a redistribution of resources to correct racial and economic injustice  99  Though his public language was guarded  so as to avoid being linked to communism by his political enemies  in private he sometimes spoke of his support for democratic socialism  In one speech  he stated that  something is wrong with capitalism  and claimed   There must be a better distribution of wealth  and maybe America must move toward a democratic socialism   100  King had read Marx while at Morehouse  but while he rejected  traditional capitalism   he also rejected Communism because of its  materialistic interpretation of history  that denied religion  its  ethical relativism   and its  political totalitarianism   101  King also stated  in his  Beyond Vietnam   speech that  true compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar     it comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring   102  122 King quoted a United States official who said that  from Vietnam to Latin America  the country was  on the wrong side of a world revolution   102  122 King condemned America s  alliance with the landed gentry of Latin America   and said that the United States should support  the shirtless and barefoot people  in the Third World rather than suppressing their attempts at revolution  102  122 3 King spoke at an Anti Vietnam demonstration where he also brought up issues of civil rights and the draft  I have not urged a mechanical fusion of the civil rights and peace movements  There are people who have come to see the moral imperative of equality  but who cannot yet see the moral imperative of world brotherhood  I would like to see the fervor of the civil rights movement imbued into the peace movement to instill it with greater strength  And I believe everyone has a duty to be in both the civil rights and peace movements  But for those who presently choose but one  I would hope they will finally come to see the moral roots common to both  103  In 1967  King gave another speech  in which he lashed out against what he called the  cruel irony  of American blacks fighting and dying for a country which treated them as second class citizens  We were taking the young black men who had been crippled by our society and sending them eight thousand miles away to guarantee liberties which they had not found in Southwest Georgia and East Harlem      We have been repeatedly faced with the cruel irony of watching Negro and white boys on TV screens as they kill and die together for a nation that has been unable to seat them in the same schools  104  105  On January 13  1968  the day after President Johnson s State of the Union Address  King called for a large march on Washington against  one of history s most cruel and senseless wars   106  107  We need to make clear in this political year  to congressmen on both sides of the aisle and to the president of the United States  that we will no longer tolerate  we will no longer vote for men who continue to see the killings of Vietnamese and Americans as the best way of advancing the goals of freedom and self determination in Southeast Asia  106  107  Poor People s Campaign  1968 Main article  Poor People s Campaign In 1968  King and the SCLC organized the  Poor People s Campaign  to address issues of economic justice  The campaign culminated in a march on Washington  D C   demanding economic aid to the poorest communities of the United States  King traveled the country to assemble  a multiracial army of the poor  that would march on Washington to engage in nonviolent civil disobedience at the Capitol until Congress created a bill of rights for poor Americans  108  109  However  the campaign was not unanimously supported by other leaders of the Civil Rights Movement  Rustin resigned from the march stating that the goals of the campaign were too broad  the demands unrealizable  and thought these campaigns would accelerate the backlash and repression on the poor and the black  110  Throughout his participation in the civil rights movement  King was criticized by many groups  This included opposition by more militant blacks and such prominent critics as Nation of Islam member Malcolm X  111 Stokely Carmichael was a separatist and disagreed with King s plea for racial integration because he considered it an insult to a uniquely African American culture  112 Omali Yeshitela urged Africans to remember the history of violent European colonization and how power was not secured by Europeans through integration  but by violence and force  113  King and the SCLC called on the government to invest in rebuilding America s cities  He felt that Congress had shown  hostility to the poor  by spending  military funds with alacrity and generosity   He contrasted this with the situation faced by poor Americans  claiming that Congress had merely provided  poverty funds with miserliness   109  His vision was for change that was more revolutionary than mere reform  he cited systematic flaws of  racism  poverty  militarism and materialism   and argued that  reconstruction of society itself is the real issue to be faced   94  148 9 Assassination and its aftermath Main article  Assassination of Martin Luther King  Jr  The Lorraine Motel  where King was assassinated  is now the site of the National Civil Rights Museum   I ve Been to the Mountaintop  Final 30 seconds of  I ve Been to the Mountaintop  speech by Martin Luther King  Jr  Problems listening to this file  See media help  On March 29  1968  King went to Memphis  Tennessee  in support of the black sanitary public works employees  represented by AFSCME Local 1733  who had been on strike since March 12 for higher wages and better treatment  In one incident  black street repairmen received pay for two hours when they were sent home because of bad weather  but white employees were paid for the full day  114  115  116  On April 3  King addressed a rally and delivered his  I ve Been to the Mountaintop  address at Mason Temple  the world headquarters of the Church of God in Christ  King s flight to Memphis had been delayed by a bomb threat against his plane  117  In the close of the last speech of his career  in reference to the bomb threat  King said the following  And then I got to Memphis  And some began to say the threats  or talk about the threats that were out  What would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers  Well  I don t know what will happen now  We ve got some difficult days ahead  But it doesn t matter with me now  Because I ve been to the mountaintop  And I don t mind  Like anybody  I would like to live a long life  Longevity has its place  But I m not concerned about that now  I just want to do God s will  And He s allowed me to go up to the mountain  And I ve looked over  And I ve seen the promised land  I may not get there with you  But I want you to know tonight  that we  as a people  will get to the promised land  So I m happy  tonight  I m not worried about anything  I m not fearing any man  Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord  118  King was booked in room 306 at the Lorraine Motel  owned by Walter Bailey  in Memphis  The Reverend Ralph Abernathy  King s close friend and colleague who was present at the assassination  testified under oath to the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations that King and his entourage stayed at room 306 at the Lorraine Motel so often it was known as the  King Abernathy suite   119  According to Jesse Jackson  who was present  King s last words on the balcony prior to his assassination were spoken to musician Ben Branch  who was scheduled to perform that night at an event King was attending   Ben  make sure you play  Take My Hand  Precious Lord  in the meeting tonight  Play it real pretty   120  Then  at 6 01 p m   April 4  1968  a shot rang out as King stood on the motel s second floor balcony  The bullet entered through his right cheek  smashing his jaw  then traveled down his spinal cord before lodging in his shoulder  121  122  Abernathy heard the shot from inside the motel room and ran to the balcony to find King on the floor  123  The events following the shooting have been disputed  as some people have accused Jackson of exaggerating his response  124  After emergency chest surgery  King was pronounced dead at St  Joseph s Hospital at 7 05 p m  125  According to biographer Taylor Branch  King s autopsy revealed that though only 39 years old  he had the heart of a 60 year old man  perhaps a result of the stress of 13 years in the civil rights movement  126  clarification needed  The assassination led to a nationwide wave of race riots in Washington D C   Chicago  Baltimore  Louisville  Kentucky  Kansas City  and dozens of other cities  127  Presidential candidate Robert F  Kennedy was on his way to Indianapolis for a campaign rally when he was informed of King s death  He gave a short speech to the gathering of supporters informing them of the tragedy and urging them to continue King s ideal of non violence  128 James Farmer  Jr  and other civil rights leaders also called for non violent action  129  while the more militant Stokely Carmichael called for a more forceful response  129  President Lyndon B  Johnson declared April 7 a national day of mourning for the civil rights leader  130  Vice President Hubert Humphrey attended King s funeral on behalf of the President  as there were fears that Johnson s presence might incite protests and perhaps violence  131  At his widow s request  King s last sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church was played at the funeral  132  a recording of his  Drum Major  sermon  given on February 4  1968  In that sermon  King made a request that at his funeral no mention of his awards and honors be made  but that it be said that he tried to  feed the hungry    clothe the naked    be right on the  Vietnam  war question   and  love and serve humanity   133  His good friend Mahalia Jackson sang his favorite hymn   Take My Hand  Precious Lord   at the funeral  134  The city of Memphis quickly settled the strike on terms favorable to the sanitation workers  135  136  Two months after King s death  escaped convict James Earl Ray was captured at London Heathrow Airport while trying to leave the United Kingdom on a false Canadian passport in the name of Ramon George Sneyd on his way to white ruled Rhodesia  137  Ray was quickly extradited to Tennessee and charged with King s murder  He confessed to the assassination on March 10  1969  though he recanted this confession three days later  138  On the advice of his attorney Percy Foreman  Ray pleaded guilty to avoid a trial conviction and thus the possibility of receiving the death penalty  Ray was sentenced to a 99 year prison term  138  139  Ray fired Foreman as his attorney  from then on derisively calling him  Percy Fourflusher   140  He claimed a man he met in Montreal  Quebec  with the alias  Raoul  was involved and that the assassination was the result of a conspiracy  141  142  He spent the remainder of his life attempting  unsuccessfully  to withdraw his guilty plea and secure the trial he never had  139  On June 10  1977  shortly after Ray had testified to the House Select Committee on Assassinations that he did not shoot King  he and six other convicts escaped from Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary in Petros  Tennessee  They were recaptured on June 13 and returned to prison  143  Allegations of conspiracy Ray s lawyers maintained he was a scapegoat similar to the way that John F  Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald is seen by conspiracy theorists  144  One of the claims used to support this assertion is that Ray s confession was given under pressure  and he had been threatened with the death penalty  139  145  Ray was a thief and burglar  but he had no record of committing violent crimes with a weapon  142  Those suspecting a conspiracy in the assassination point to the two successive ballistics tests which while proving that a rifle similar to Ray s Remington Gamemaster had been the murder weapon  did not prove that his specific rifle had been the one used  139  146  Moreover  witnesses surrounding King at the moment of his death say the shot came from another location  from behind thick shrubbery near the rooming house which had been inexplicably cut away in the days following the assassination and not from the rooming house window  147  Martin Luther King  amp  Coretta Scott King s tomb  located on the grounds of the Martin Luther King  Jr  National Historic Site in Atlanta  Georgia  In 1997  King s son Dexter Scott King met with Ray  and publicly supported Ray s efforts to obtain a new trial  148  Two years later  Coretta Scott King  King s widow  along with the rest of King s family  won a wrongful death claim against Loyd Jowers and  other unknown co conspirators   Jowers claimed to have received  100 000 to arrange King s assassination  The jury of six whites and six blacks found Jowers guilty and that government agencies were party to the assassination  149 William F  Pepper represented the King family in the trial  150  In 2000  the United States Department of Justice completed the investigation about Jowers  claims but did not find evidence to support allegations about conspiracy  The investigation report recommended no further investigation unless some new reliable facts are presented  151  In 2002  The New York Times reported a church minister  Rev  Ronald Denton Wilson  claimed his father  Henry Clay Wilson not James Earl Ray assassinated Martin Luther King  Jr  He stated   It wasn t a racist thing  he thought Martin Luther King was connected with communism  and he wanted to get him out of the way   Wilson provided no evidence to back up his claims  152  King biographer David Garrow disagrees with William F  Pepper s claims that the government killed King  He is supported by author Gerald Posner who has researched and written about the assassination  153  In 2003  William Pepper published a book about the long investigation and trial  as well as his representation of James Earl Ray in his bid for a trial  laying out the evidence and refuting other accounts  154  King s friend and colleague  James Bevel  disputed the argument that Ray acted alone  stating   There is no way a ten cent white boy could develop a plan to kill a million dollar black man   155  In 2004  Jesse Jackson  who was with King at the time of his death  noted  The fact is there were saboteurs to disrupt the march  And within our own organization  we found a very key person who was on the government payroll  So infiltration within  saboteurs from without and the press attacks      I will never believe that James Earl Ray had the motive  the money and the mobility to have done it himself  Our government was very involved in setting the stage for and I think the escape route for James Earl Ray  156  Personality and public image FBI surveillance and wiretapping J  Edgar Hoover  the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation  for years had been suspicious about potential influence of communists in social movements such as labor unions and civil rights  157  Hoover directed the FBI to track King in 1957  and the SCLC as it was established  it did not have a full time executive director until 1960   51  its investigations were largely superficial until 1962  when it learned that one of King s most trusted advisers was New York City lawyer Stanley Levison  The FBI found Levison had been involved with the Communist Party USA  158   233 The FBI feared Levison was working as an  agent of influence  over King  in spite of its own reports in 1963 that Levison had left the Party and was no longer associated in business dealings with them  158  71 3 158  70 4 Another King lieutenant  Hunter Pitts O Dell  was also linked to the Communist Party by sworn testimony before the House Un American Activities Committee  HUAC   159  However  by 1976 the FBI had acknowledged that it had not obtained any evidence that King himself or the SCLC were actually involved with any communist organizations  160  The Bureau received authorization to proceed with wiretapping from Attorney General Robert F  Kennedy in the fall of 1963 161  and informed President John F  Kennedy  both of whom unsuccessfully tried to persuade King to dissociate himself from Levison  162  Although Robert Kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of King s phones  on a trial basis  for a month or so   163  372 Hoover extended the clearance so his men were  unshackled  to look for evidence in any areas of King s life they deemed worthy  163  372 4 The Bureau placed wiretaps on Levison s and King s home and office phones  and bugged King s rooms in hotels as he traveled across the country  162  164  For his part  King adamantly denied having any connections to Communism  stating in a 1965 Playboy interview that  there are as many Communists in this freedom movement as there are Eskimos in Florida   77  362 and claiming that Hoover was  following the path of appeasement of political powers in the South  and that his concern for communist infiltration of the civil rights movement was meant to  aid and abet the salacious claims of southern racists and the extreme right wing elements   160  Hoover did not believe his pledge of innocence and replied by saying that King was  the most notorious liar in the country   165  After King gave his  I Have A Dream  speech during the March on Washington on August 28  1963  the FBI described King as  the most dangerous and effective Negro leader in the country   164  They alleged that King was  knowingly  willingly and regularly cooperating with and taking guidance from communists   158  83 The attempt to prove that King was a Communist was related to the feeling of many segregationists that blacks in the South were happy with their lot but had been stirred up by  communists  and  outside agitators   166  However  the civil rights movement arose from activism within the black community dating back to before World War I  King said that  the Negro revolution is a genuine revolution  born from the same womb that produces all massive social upheavals the womb of intolerable conditions and unendurable situations   77  363 Martin Luther King  Jr  and Malcolm X  March 26  1964  Allegations of adultery Having concluded that King was dangerous due to communist infiltration  the FBI shifted to attempting to discredit King through revelations regarding his private life  FBI surveillance of King  some of it since made public  attempted to demonstrate that he also engaged in numerous extramarital affairs  164  Lyndon Johnson once said that King was a  hypocritical preacher   167  Ralph Abernathy  a close associate of King s  stated in his 1989 autobiography And the Walls Came Tumbling Down that King had a  weakness for women   168  In a later interview  Abernathy said he only wrote the term  womanizing   did not specifically say King had extramarital sex and that the infidelities King had were emotional rather than sexual  169  170  King s biographer David Garrow wrote about a number of extramarital affairs  including one woman King saw almost daily  According to Garrow   that relationship  rather than his marriage  increasingly became the emotional centerpiece of King s life  but it did not eliminate the incidental couplings   of King s travels   King explained his extramarital affairs as  a form of anxiety reduction   Garrow noted that King s promiscuity was the cause of  painful and overwhelming guilt   171  The FBI distributed reports regarding such affairs to the executive branch  friendly reporters  potential coalition partners and funding sources of the SCLC  and King s family  172  The Bureau also sent anonymous letters to King threatening to reveal information if he did not cease his civil rights work  173  One anonymous letter sent to King just before he received the Nobel Peace Prize read  in part   The American public  the church organizations that have been helping Protestants  Catholics and Jews will know you for what you are an evil beast  So will others who have backed you  You are done  King  there is only one thing left for you to do  You know what it is  You have just 34 days in which to do  this exact number has been selected for a specific reason  it has definite practical significant  sic    You are done  There is but one way out for you  You better take it before your filthy fraudulent self is bared to the nation   174  King interpreted this as encouragement for him to commit suicide  175  although William Sullivan  head of the Domestic Intelligence Division at the time  argued that it may have only been intended to  convince Dr  King to resign from the SCLC   160  King refused to give in to the FBI s threats  176 Judge John Lewis Smith  Jr  in 1977 ordered that all known copies of the recorded audiotapes and written transcripts resulting from the FBI s electronic surveillance of King between 1963 and 1968 to be held in the National Archives and sealed from public access until 2027  177  Across from the Lorraine Motel  next to the boarding house in which James Earl Ray was staying  was a fire station  Police officers were stationed in the fire station to keep King under surveillance  178  Using papered over windows with peepholes cut into them  the agents were watching the scene while Martin Luther King was shot  179  Immediately following the shooting  officers rushed out of the station to the motel  and Marrell McCollough  an undercover police officer  was the first person to administer first aid to King  180  The antagonism between King and the FBI  the lack of an all points bulletin to find the killer  and the police presence nearby have led to speculation that the FBI was involved in the assassination  181  Legacy President Johnson signs the Civil Rights Act of 1964  Among the guests behind him is Martin Luther King  From the Gallery of 20th Century Martyrs at Westminster Abbey l  to r  Mother Elizabeth of Russia  Rev  Martin Luther King  Archbishop Oscar Romero and Pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer King s main legacy was to secure progress on civil rights in the United States  which has enabled more Americans to reach their potential  He is frequently referenced as a human rights icon today  His name and legacy have often been invoked since his death as people have debated his likely position on various modern political issues  On the international scene  King s legacy included influences on the Black Consciousness Movement and Civil Rights Movement in South Africa  182  183  King s work was cited by and served as an inspiration for South African leader Albert Lutuli  another black Nobel Peace prize winner who fought for racial justice in his country  6  307 8 The day following King s assassination  school teacher Jane Elliott conducted her first  Blue Eyes Brown Eyes  exercise with her class of elementary school students in Riceville  Iowa  Her purpose was to help them understand King s death as it related to racism  something they little understood from having lived in a predominately white community  184  King s wife  Coretta Scott King  followed her husband s footsteps and was active in matters of social justice and civil rights until her death in 2006  The same year that Martin Luther King was assassinated  she established the King Center in Atlanta  Georgia  dedicated to preserving his legacy and the work of championing nonviolent conflict resolution and tolerance worldwide  185  Their son  Dexter King  currently serves as the center s chairman  186  187  Daughter Yolanda King  who died in 2007  was a motivational speaker  author and founder of Higher Ground Productions  an organization specializing in diversity training  188  There are opposing views  even within the King family  of the slain civil rights leader s religious and political views about gay  lesbian  bisexual and transgender people  King s widow Coretta said publicly that she believed her husband would have supported gay rights  However  his daughter Bernice believed he would have been opposed to gay marriage  189  The King Center includes discrimination  and lists homophobia as one of its examples  in its list of  The Triple Evils  that should be opposed  190  In 1980  the Department of Interior designated King s boyhood home in Atlanta and several nearby buildings the Martin Luther King  Jr  National Historic Site  In 1996  United States Congress authorized the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity to establish a foundation to manage fund raising and design of a national Martin Luther King  Jr  Memorial on the Mall in Washington  D C  191  King was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity  established by and for African Americans  192  King was the first African American honored with his own memorial in the National Mall area and the first non President to be commemorated in such a way  193  The King Memorial will be administered by the National Park Service  194  King s life and assassination inspired many artistic works  A 1976 Broadway production  I Have a Dream  was directed by Robert Greenwald and starred Billy Dee Williams as King  195  In spring of 2006  a stage play Passages of Martin Luther King about King was produced in Beijing  China with King portrayed by Chinese actor  Cao Li  The play was written by Stanford University professor  Clayborne Carson  196  197  King spoke earlier about what people should remember him for if they are around for his funeral  He said rather than his awards and where he went to school  people should talk about how he fought peacefully for justice  I d like somebody to mention that day that Martin Luther King Jr  tried to give his life serving others  I d like for somebody to say that day that Martin Luther King Jr  tried to love somebody  I want you to say that day that I tried to be right on the war question  I want you to be able to say that day that I did try to feed the hungry  I want you to be able to say that day that I did try in my life to clothe those who were naked  I want you to say on that day that I did try in my life to visit those who were in prison  And I want you to say that I tried to love and serve humanity  Yes  if you want to say that I was a drum major  Say that I was a drum major for justice  Say that I was a drum major for peace  I was a drum major for righteousness  And all of the other shallow things will not matter  129  Martin Luther King  Jr  Day Main article  Martin Luther King  Jr  Day At the White House Rose Garden on November 2  1983  President Ronald Reagan
