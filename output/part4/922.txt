Malcolm Little was born on May 19  1925  in Omaha  Nebraska  the fourth of seven children to Earl Little and Louise Norton  2  His father was an outspoken Baptist lay speaker  He supported Pan African activist Marcus Garvey and was a local leader of the Universal Negro Improvement Association  UNIA   3  Malcolm never forgot the values of black pride and self reliance that his father and other UNIA leaders preached  4  Malcolm X later said that three of Earl Little s brothers  one of whom was lynched  died violently at the hands of white men  5  Because of Ku Klux Klan threats  the family relocated in 1926 to Milwaukee  Wisconsin  and shortly thereafter to Lansing  Michigan  6  Earl Little  who was dark skinned  was born in Reynolds  Georgia  7  He had three children from his first marriage  Ella  Mary  and Earl Jr  and seven with his second wife  Louise  Wilfred  Hilda  Philbert  Malcolm  Reginald  Yvonne  and Wesley  8  Louise Norton Little was born in Grenada  Because her father was Scottish  she was so light skinned that she could have passed for white  Malcolm inherited his light complexion from his mother and maternal grandfather  9  Initially he felt his light skin was a status symbol  but he later said he  hated every drop of that white rapist s blood that is in me   10  Malcolm X later remembered feeling that his father favored him because he was the lightest skinned child in the family  however  he thought his mother treated him harshly for the same reason  11  One of Malcolm s nicknames   Red   derived from the tinge of his hair  According to one biographer  at birth he had  ash blonde hair     tinged with cinnamon   and at age four   reddish blonde hair   12  His hair darkened as he aged  yet he also resembled his paternal grandmother  whose hair  turned reddish in the summer sun   2  The issue of skin and hair color took on very significant implications later in Malcolm s life  7  In December 1924  Louise Little was threatened by klansmen while she was pregnant with Malcolm  She recalled that the klansmen warned the family to leave Omaha  because Earl Little s activities with UNIA were  spreading trouble   13  After they moved to Lansing  their house was burned in 1929  however  the family escaped without physical injury  On September 8  1931  Earl Little was fatally struck by a streetcar in Lansing  Authorities ruled his death an accident  The police reported that Earl Little was conscious when they arrived on the scene  and he told them he had slipped and fallen under the streetcar s wheels  14  The black community in Lansing disputed the cause of death  believing there was circumstantial evidence of assault  His family had frequently been harassed by the Black Legion  a white supremacist group that his father accused of burning down their home in 1929  Some blacks believed the Black Legion was responsible for Earl Little s death  One of the adults at the funeral told eight year old Philbert Little that his father had been hit from behind and shoved under the streetcar  15  Though Earl Little had two life insurance policies  his family received death benefits solely from the smaller policy  The insurance company of the larger policy claimed that his father had committed suicide and refused to issue the benefit  16  The payout from the insurance policy was  1 000  comparable to about  15 000 in 2010 dollars   and the probate court awarded Louise Little a monthly  widow s allowance  of  18  She rented space in the garden to raise more money  and her sons would hunt game for supper  17  In 1935 or 1936  Louise Little began dating an African American man  A marriage proposal seemed a possibility  but the man disappeared from their lives when Louise became pregnant with his child in late 1937  18  In December 1938  Louise Little had a nervous breakdown and was declared legally insane  The Little siblings were split up and sent to different foster homes  The state formally committed Louise Little to the state mental hospital at Kalamazoo  Michigan  where she remained until Malcolm and his siblings secured her release 24 years later  19  20  Malcolm Little was one of the best students in his junior high school  but he dropped out after a white eighth grade teacher told him that his aspirations of being a lawyer were  no realistic goal for a nigger   21  Years later  Malcolm X would laugh about the incident  but at the time it was humiliating  It made him feel that there was no place in the white world for a career oriented black man  no matter how smart he was  21  After living with a series of foster parents  Malcolm moved to Boston in February 1941 to live with his older half sister  Ella Little Collins  22  23  Young adult years Collins lived in Roxbury  a predominantly African American middle class neighborhood of Boston  It was the first time Little had seen so many black people  He was drawn to the cultural and social life of the neighborhood  24  In Boston  Little held a variety of jobs and found intermittent employment with the New Haven Railroad  Between 1943 and 1946  he drifted from city to city and job to job  He left Boston to live for a short time in Flint  Michigan  He moved to New York City in 1943  Living in Harlem  he became involved in drug dealing  gambling  racketeering  robbery  and pimping  25  During this period  Little became known as  Detroit Red  because he came from Michigan and because of the reddish color of his hair  26  According to recent biographies  Little occasionally engaged in sex with other men  usually for money  27  28  In 1943  the U S  draft board ordered Little to register for military service  29  He later recalled that he put on a display to avoid the draft by telling the examining officer that he could not wait to  steal us some guns  and kill us  some  crackers   30  Military physicians classified him as  mentally disqualified for military service   He was issued a 4 F card  relieving him of his service obligations  29  In late 1945  Little returned to Boston  With a group of associates  he began a series of elaborate burglaries targeting the residences of wealthy white families  31  On January 12  1946  Little was arrested for burglary while trying to pick up a stolen watch he had left for repairs at a jewelry shop  32  The shop owner called the police because the watch was very expensive  and the police had alerted all Boston jewelers that it had been stolen  Little told the police that he had a gun on his person and surrendered so the police would treat him more leniently  33  Three days later  Little was indicted for carrying firearms  On January 16  he was charged with larceny and breaking and entering  and eventually sentenced to eight to ten years in prison  34  On February 27  Little began serving his sentence at the Charlestown State Prison in Charlestown  Boston  While in prison  Little earned the nickname of  Satan  for his hostility toward religion  35  Little met a self educated man in prison named John Elton Bembry  referred to as  Bimbi  in The Autobiography of Malcolm X   36  Bembry was a well regarded prisoner at Charlestown  and Malcolm X would later describe him as  the first man I had ever seen command total respect     with words   37  Gradually  the two men became friends and Bembry convinced Little to educate himself  38  Little developed a voracious appetite for reading  and he frequently read after the prison lights had been turned off  39  In 1948  Little s brother Philbert wrote  telling him about the Nation of Islam  Like the UNIA  the Nation preached black self reliance and  ultimately  the unification of members of the African diaspora  free from white American and European domination  40  Little was not interested in joining until his brother Reginald wrote  saying   Malcolm  don t eat any more pork and don t smoke any more cigarettes  I ll show you how to get out of prison   41  Little quit smoking  and the next time pork was served in the prison dining hall  he refused to eat it  42  When Reginald came to visit Little  he described the group s teachings  including the belief that white people are devils  Afterward  Little thought about all the white people he had known  and he realized that he d never had a relationship with a white person or social institution that wasn t based on dishonesty  injustice  greed  and hatred  Little began to reconsider his dismissal of all religion and he became receptive to the message of the Nation of Islam  Other family members who had joined the Nation wrote or visited and encouraged Little to join  43  In February 1948  mostly through his sister s efforts  Little was transferred to the Norfolk Prison Colony  an experimental prison in Norfolk  Massachusetts  that had a much larger library  44  In late 1948  he wrote a letter to Elijah Muhammad  the leader of the Nation of Islam  Muhammad advised him to atone for his crimes by renouncing his past and by humbly bowing in prayer to Allah and promising never to engage in destructive behavior again  Little  who always had been rebellious and deeply skeptical  found it very difficult to bow in prayer  It took him a week to bend his knees  Finally he prayed  and he became a member of the Nation of Islam  45  For the remainder of his incarceration  Little maintained regular correspondence with Muhammad  46  On August 7  1952  Little was paroled and was released from prison  47  He later reflected on the time he spent in prison after his conversion   Between Mr  Muhammad s teachings  my correspondence  my visitors usually Ella and Reginald and my reading of books  months passed without my even thinking about being imprisoned  In fact  up to then  I had never been so truly free in my life   48  Nation of Islam Part of a series on the Nation of Islam Leaders Wallace Fard MuhammadElijah Muhammad   Malcolm XWarith Deen MohammedLouis FarrakhanTynetta

Panther PartyUnited Nation of IslamYour Black Muslim Bakery v t e Further information  Nation of Islam When Little was released from prison in 1952  he had more than a new religion  He also had a new name  In a December 1950 letter to his brother Philbert  Little signed his name as Malcolm X for the first time  49  In his autobiography  he explained why   The Muslim s  X  symbolized the true African family name that he never could know  For me  my  X  replaced the white slavemaster name of  Little  which some blue eyed devil named Little had imposed upon my paternal forebears   50  Shortly after his release from prison  Malcolm X visited Elijah Muhammad in Chicago  Illinois  51  In June 1953  Malcolm X was named assistant minister of the Nation of Islam s Temple Number One in Detroit  52  53  Soon  he became a full time minister  54  By late 1953  Malcolm X established Boston s Temple Number 11  55  In March 1954  he expanded Temple Number 12 in Philadelphia  Pennsylvania  56  Two months later Malcolm X was selected to lead Temple Number Seven in Harlem  57  and he rapidly expanded its membership  58  The FBI had opened a file on Malcolm X in 1950 after he wrote a letter to President Truman stating his opposition to the Korean War and declaring himself to be a communist  59  It began surveillance of him in 1953  and soon the FBI turned its attention from concerns about possible Communist Party association to Malcolm X s rapid ascent in the Nation of Islam  60  During 1955  Malcolm X continued his successful recruitment efforts on behalf of the organization  He established temples in Springfield  Massachusetts  Number 13   Hartford  Connecticut  Number 14   and Atlanta  Georgia  Number 15   Hundreds of African Americans were joining the Nation of Islam every month  61  Beside his skill as a speaker  Malcolm X had an impressive physical presence  He stood 6 feet 3 inches  1 91 m  tall and weighed about 180 pounds  82 kg   62  One writer described him as  powerfully built   63  and another as  mesmerizingly handsome     and always spotlessly well groomed   62  Johnson Hinton incident Malcolm X first came to the attention of the general public after the police beating of a Nation of Islam member named Johnson Hinton  64  65  On April 26  1957  two police officers were beating an African American man with their nightsticks when three passersby who belonged to the Nation of Islam tried to intervene  64  They shouted   You re not in Alabama or Georgia  This is New York   65  One of the officers began to beat one of the passersby  Johnson Hinton  The blows were so severe  a surgeon later determined  that they caused brain contusions  subdural hemorrhaging  and scalp lacerations  All four men were arrested and taken to the police station  64  A woman who had seen the assault ran to the Nation of Islam s restaurant  64  Within a few hours  Malcolm X and a small group of Muslims went to the police station and demanded to see Hinton  The police captain initially said no Muslims were being held there  but as the crowd grew to about 500  he allowed Malcolm X to speak with Hinton  66  After a short talk  Malcolm X demanded that Hinton be taken to the hospital  so an ambulance was called and Hinton was taken to Harlem Hospital  67  Hinton was treated and released into the custody of the police  who returned him to the police station  66  By this point  about 4 000 people had gathered  the police realized there was the potential for a riot and called for backup  Malcolm X went back into the police station with an attorney and made bail arrangements for the other two Muslims  The police said Hinton could not go back to the hospital until he was arraigned the following day  67  Malcolm X realized things were at a stalemate  He stepped outside the station house and gave a hand signal  67  The Nation of Islam members in the crowd silently walked away  The rest of the crowd dispersed minutes later  One police officer told the editor of the New York Amsterdam News   No one man should have that much power   67  68  The following month  the Bureau of Special Services and Investigation of the New York Police Department  NYPD  began its surveillance of Malcolm X  The NYPD s Chief Inspector asked for information from the police department in every city where Malcolm X had lived  and from the prisons where he had served his sentence  69  In October  when a grand jury declined to indict the officers who had beaten Hinton  Malcolm X wrote an angry telegram to the police commissioner  In response  undercover NYPD officers were placed inside the Nation of Islam  70  Marriage and family Malcolm X met Betty Sanders in 1955  She had been invited to listen to his lecture  and she was very impressed by him  They met again at a dinner party  Soon Sanders was attending all of Malcolm X s lectures at Temple Number Seven  In mid 1956  she joined the Nation of Islam  71  Malcolm X and Betty X did not have a conventional courtship  One on one dates were contrary to the teachings of the Nation of Islam  Instead  the couple shared their  dates  with dozens  or even hundreds of other members  Malcolm X frequently took groups to visit New York s museums and libraries  and he always invited Betty X  72  Although they had never discussed the subject  Betty X suspected that Malcolm X was interested in marriage  On January 12  1958  he called from Detroit and asked her to marry him  and they were married two days later in Lansing  Michigan  73  74  The couple had six daughters  Their names were Attallah  born in 1958 and named after Attila the Hun  75  76 Qubilah  born in 1960 and named after Kublai Khan  77 Ilyasah  born in 1962 and named after Elijah Muhammad  78  Gamilah Lumumba  born in 1964 and named after Patrice Lumumba  79  and twins  Malikah and Malaak  born in 1965 after their father s assassination and named for him  80  The Hate That Hate Produced After a 1959 television broadcast in New York City about the Nation of Islam  The Hate That Hate Produced  Malcolm X became known to white Americans  Representatives of the print media  radio  and television frequently asked him for comments on issues  81  By the late 1950s  Malcolm X had acquired a new name  Malcolm Shabazz or Malik el Shabazz  although he was still widely referred to as Malcolm X  82  In September 1960  Fidel Castro arrived in New York to attend the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly  He and his entourage stayed at the Hotel Theresa in Harlem  Malcolm X was a prominent member of a Harlem based welcoming committee made up of community leaders who met with Castro  83  Castro was so impressed by Malcolm X that he requested a private meeting with him  At the end of their two hour meeting  Castro invited Malcolm X to visit him in Cuba  84  During the General Assembly meeting  Malcolm X was also invited to many official embassy functions sponsored by African nations  where he met heads of state and other leaders  including Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt  Ahmed S kou Tour  of Guinea  and Kenneth Kaunda of the Zambian African National Congress  85  From his adoption of the Nation of Islam in 1952 until he broke with it in 1964  Malcolm X promoted the Nation s teachings  including that black people are the original people of the world  86  that white people are  devils   87  that blacks are superior to whites  and that the demise of the white race is imminent  88  While the civil rights movement fought against racial segregation  Malcolm X advocated the complete separation of African Americans from white people  He proposed the establishment of a separate country for black people 89  as an interim measure until African Americans could return to Africa  90  Malcolm X also rejected the civil rights movement s strategy of nonviolence  and instead advocated that black people use any necessary means of self defense to protect themselves  91  Malcolm X s speeches had a powerful effect on his audiences  generally African Americans who lived in the Northern and Western cities  who were tired of being told to wait for freedom  justice  equality and respect  92  Many blacks felt that he articulated their complaints better than the civil rights movement did  93  94  Malcolm X has been widely considered the second most influential leader of the Nation of Islam after Elijah Muhammad  95  He was largely credited with the group s dramatic increase in membership between the early 1950s and early 1960s  from 500 to 25 000 by one author s estimate  96  or from 1 200 to 50 000 or 75 000 by another s   97  98  He inspired the boxer Cassius Clay  later known as Muhammad Ali  to join the Nation of Islam  99   though like Malcolm X himself  Ali later left the group to become a Sunni Muslim   100  Many white people  and even some blacks  were alarmed by Malcolm X and the things he said  He and the Nation of Islam were described as hatemongers  black supremacists  violence seekers  and a threat to improved race relations  Civil rights organizations denounced Malcolm X and the Nation as irresponsible extremists whose views were not representative of African Americans  101  102  Malcolm X was accused of being antisemitic  103  Malcolm X was equally critical of the civil rights movement  104  He described its leaders as  stooges  for the white establishment  and he once described Martin Luther King  Jr  as a  chump   105  106  He criticized the 1963 March on Washington  which he called  the farce on Washington   107  He said he did not know why black people were excited over a demonstration  run by whites in front of a statue of a president who has been dead for a hundred years and who didn t like us when he was alive   108  Leaving the Nation On December 1  1963  when he was asked for a comment about the assassination of President Kennedy  Malcolm X said that it was a case of  chickens coming home to roost   He added that  chickens coming home to roost never did make me sad  they ve always made me glad   109 The New York Times wrote   in further criticism of Mr  Kennedy  the Muslim leader cited the murders of Patrice Lumumba  Congo leader  of Medgar Evers  civil rights leader  and of the Negro girls bombed earlier this year in a Birmingham church  These  he said  were instances of other  chickens coming home to roost    109  The remarks prompted a widespread public outcry  The Nation of Islam  which had issued a message of condolence to the Kennedy family and ordered its ministers not to comment on the assassination  publicly censured their former shining star  110  Although Malcolm X retained his post and rank as minister  he was prohibited from public speaking for 90 days  111  Martin Luther King  Jr   left  and Malcolm X  March 26  1964 On March 8  1964  Malcolm X publicly announced his break from the Nation of Islam  He said that he was still a Muslim  but he felt the Nation of Islam had  gone as far as it can  because of its rigid religious teachings  112  Malcolm X said he was going to organize a black nationalist organization that would try to  heighten the political consciousness  of African Americans  112  He also expressed his desire to work with other civil rights leaders and said that Elijah Muhammad had prevented him from doing so in the past  112  One reason for the separation was growing tension between Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammad because of Malcolm X s dismay about rumors of Muhammad s extramarital affairs with young secretaries  actions that were against the teachings of the Nation  Although at first Malcolm X had ignored the rumors  after speaking with Muhammad s son Wallace and the women making the accusations  he came to believe that they were true  Muhammad confirmed the rumors in 1963 but tried to justify his actions by reference to precedents set by Biblical prophets  113  Another reason for the separation was growing resentment by people within the Nation  As Malcolm X had become a favorite of the media  many in the Nation s Chicago headquarters felt that he was over shadowing Muhammad  Louis Lomax s 1963 book about the Nation of Islam  When the Word Is Given  featured a picture of Malcolm X on its cover and included five of his speeches  but only one of Muhammad s  which greatly upset Muhammad  Muhammad was also envious that a publisher was interested in Malcolm X s autobiography  114  After leaving the Nation of Islam  Malcolm X founded Muslim Mosque  Inc   a religious organization  115  116  and the Organization of Afro American Unity  a secular group that advocated Pan Africanism  117  118  On March 26  1964  he met Martin Luther King  Jr  in Washington  D C   after a press conference held when both men attended the Senate to hear the debate on the Civil Rights bill  This was the only time the two men ever met and their meeting lasted only one minute just long enough for photographers to take a picture  119  120  In April  Malcolm X made a speech titled  The Ballot or the Bullet  in which he advised African Americans to exercise their right to vote wisely  121  122  Several Sunni Muslims encouraged Malcolm X to learn about Islam  Soon he converted to Sunni Islam  and decided to make his pilgrimage to Mecca  hajj   123  International travel Pilgrimage to Mecca On April 13  1964  Malcolm X departed JFK Airport in New York for Jeddah  Saudi Arabia  His status as an authentic Muslim was questioned by Saudi authorities because of his United States passport and his inability to speak Arabic  Since only confessing Muslims are allowed into Mecca  he was separated from his group for about 20 hours  124  125  According to his autobiography  Malcolm X saw a telephone and remembered the book The Eternal Message of Muhammad by Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam  which had been presented to him with his visa approval  He called Azzam s son  who arranged for his release  At the younger Azzam s home  he met Azzam Pasha  who gave Malcolm his suite at the Jeddah Palace Hotel  The next morning  Muhammad Faisal  the son of Prince Faisal  visited and informed Malcolm X that he was to be a state guest  The deputy chief of protocol accompanied Malcolm X to the Hajj Court  where he was allowed to make his pilgrimage  126  On April 19  Malcolm X completed the Hajj  making the seven circuits around the Kaaba  drinking from the Zamzam Well  and running between the hills of Safah and Marwah seven times  127  After completing the Hajj  he was granted an audience with Prince Faisal  128  Malcolm X said the trip allowed him to see Muslims of different races interacting as equals  He came to believe that Islam could be the means by which racial problems could be overcome  129  Africa Malcolm X visited Africa on three separate occasions  once in 1959 and twice in 1964  During his visits  he met officials  gave interviews to newspapers  and spoke on television and radio in Egypt  Ethiopia  Tanganyika  now Tanzania   Nigeria  Ghana  Guinea  Sudan  Senegal  Liberia  Algeria  and Morocco  130 Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana  Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt  and Ahmed Ben Bella of Algeria invited Malcolm X to serve in their governments  131  In 1959  Malcolm X traveled to Egypt  then known as the United Arab Republic   Sudan  Nigeria  and Ghana to arrange a tour for Elijah Muhammad  132  The first of the two trips Malcolm X made to Africa in 1964 lasted from April 13 until May 21  before and after his Hajj  133  On May 8  following his speech at the University of Ibadan  Malcolm X was made an honorary member of the Nigerian Muslim Students  Association  During this reception the students bestowed upon him the name  Omowale   which means  the son who has come home  in the Yoruba language  134  Malcolm X wrote in his autobiography that he  had never received a more treasured honor   135  On July 9  1964  Malcolm X returned to Africa  136  On July 17  he was welcomed to the second meeting of the Organization of African Unity in Cairo as a representative of the Organization of Afro American Unity  By the time he returned to the United States on November 24  1964  Malcolm had met with every prominent African leader and established an international connection between Africans on the continent and those in the diaspora  131  France and the United Kingdom On November 23  1964  on his way home from Africa  Malcolm X stopped in Paris  where he spoke at the Salle de la Mutualit   137  138  A week later  on November 30  Malcolm X flew to the United Kingdom  and on December 3 participated in a debate at the Oxford Union  The topic of the debate was  Extremism in the Defense of Liberty is No Vice  Moderation in the Pursuit of Justice is No Virtue   and Malcolm X argued the affirmative  Interest in the debate was so high that it was televised nationally by the BBC  139  140  On February 5  1965  Malcolm X went to Europe again  141  On February 8  he spoke in London  before the first meeting of the Council of African Organizations  142  The next day  Malcolm X tried to go to France  but he was refused entry  143  On February 12  he visited Smethwick  near Birmingham  which had become a byword for racial division after the 1964 general election  when the Conservative Party won the parliamentary seat after rumors that their candidate s supporters had used the slogan  If you want a nigger for your neighbour  vote Labour   144  Return to United States After leaving the Nation of Islam  Malcolm X spoke before a wide variety of audiences in the United States  He spoke at regular meetings of Muslim Mosque  Inc   and the Organization of Afro American Unity  He was one of the most sought after speakers on college campuses  145  and one of his top aides later wrote that he  welcomed every opportunity to speak to college students   146  Malcolm X also spoke before political groups such as the Militant Labor Forum  147  Tensions increased between Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam  As early as February 1964  a leader of Temple Number Seven ordered a member of the Fruit of Islam to wire explosives to Malcolm X s car  148  In September 1964  Ebony published a photograph of Malcolm X holding an M1 Carbine and peering out a window  The photo was intended to illustrate his determination to defend himself and his family against the death threats he was receiving  149  150  The Nation of Islam and its leaders began making both public and private threats against Malcolm X  On March 23  1964  Elijah Muhammad told Boston minister Louis X  later known as Louis Farrakhan  that  hypocrites like Malcolm should have their heads cut off   151  The April 10 edition of Muhammad Speaks featured a cartoon in which his severed head was shown bouncing  152  On July 9  John Ali  a top aide to Muhammad  answered a question about Malcolm X by saying that  anyone who opposes the Honorable Elijah Muhammad puts their life in jeopardy   153  The December 4 issue of Muhammad Speaks included an article by Louis X that railed against Malcolm X  saying  such a man as Malcolm is worthy of death   154  Some threats were made anonymously  During the month of June 1964  FBI surveillance recorded two such threats  On June 8  a man called Malcolm X s home and told Betty Shabazz to  tell him he s as good as dead   155  On June 12  an FBI informant reported getting an anonymous telephone call from somebody who said  Malcolm X is going to be bumped off   156  In June 1964  the Nation of Islam sued to reclaim Malcolm X s residence in Queens  New York  which they claimed to own  The suit was successful  and Malcolm X was ordered to vacate  157  On February 14  1965  the night before a scheduled hearing to postpone the eviction date  the house burned to the ground  Malcolm X and his family survived  No one was charged with any crime  158  Assassination The Audubon Ballroom stage on which Malcolm X was attacked  Circles on the mural mark bullet holes  On February 21  1965  as Malcolm X prepared to address the Organization of Afro American Unity in Manhattan s Audubon Ballroom  a disturbance broke out in the 400 person audience 159  a man yelled   Nigger  Get your hand outta my pocket   160  161  As Malcolm X and his bodyguards moved to quiet the disturbance  162  a man rushed forward and shot him in the chest with a sawed off shotgun  163  Two other men charged the stage and fired semi automatic handguns  hitting Malcolm X several times  161  He was pronounced dead at 3 30 pm  shortly after he arrived at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital  159  According to the autopsy report  Malcolm X s body had 21 gunshot wounds  ten of them from the initial shotgun blast  164  One gunman  Nation of Islam member Talmadge Hayer  also known as Thomas Hagan  was seized and beaten by the crowd before the police arrived minutes later  165  166  witnesses identified the others as Norman 3X Butler and Thomas 15X Johnson  also Nation members  167  Hayer confessed at trial to have been one of the handgun shooters  but refused to identify the other assailants except to assert that they were not Butler and Johnson  168  All three were convicted  169  Butler  now known as Muhammad Abdul Aziz  was paroled in 1985 and became the head of the Nation s Harlem mosque in 1998  He continues to maintain his innocence  170  Johnson  who changed his name to Khalil Islam  rejected the Nation s teachings while in prison and converted to Sunni Islam  Released in 1987  he maintained his innocence until his death in August 2009  171  172  Hayer  now known as Mujahid Halim  173  was paroled in 2010  174  Funeral A public viewing was held at Harlem s Unity Funeral Home from February 23 through February 26  and it was estimated that between 14 000 and 30 000 mourners attended  175  The funeral was held on February 27 at the Faith Temple Church of God in Christ in Harlem  The church was filled to capacity with more than 1 000 people  176  Loudspeakers were set up outside the Temple so the overflowing crowd could listen 177  and a local television station broadcast the funeral live  178  Among the civil rights leaders attending were John Lewis  Bayard Rustin  James Forman  James Farmer  Jesse Gray  and Andrew Young  176  179  Actor and activist Ossie Davis delivered the eulogy  describing Malcolm X as  our shining black prince   There are those who will consider it their duty  as friends of the Negro people  to tell us to revile him  to flee  even from the presence of his memory  to save ourselves by writing him out of the history of our turbulent times  Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy  controversial and bold young captain and we will smile  Many will say turn away away from this man  for he is not a man but a demon  a monster  a subverter and an enemy of the black man and we will smile  They will say that he is of hate a fanatic  a racist who can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle  And we will answer and say to them  Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm  Did you ever touch him  or have him smile at you  Did you ever really listen to him  Did he ever do a mean thing  Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance  For if you did you would know him  And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him  180  Malcolm X was buried at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale  New York  178  At the gravesite after the ceremony  friends took the shovels from the waiting gravediggers and completed the burial themselves  181  Actor and activist Ruby Dee  wife of Ossie Davis  and Juanita Poitier  wife of Sidney Poitier  established the Committee of Concerned Mothers to raise funds to buy a house and pay educational expenses for Malcolm X s family  182  Responses to assassination Reactions to Malcolm X s assassination were varied  Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr  sent a telegram to Betty Shabazz  expressing his sadness over  the shocking and tragic assassination of your husband   While we did not always see eye to eye on methods to solve the race problem  I always had a deep affection for Malcolm and felt that he had a great ability to put his finger on the existence and root of the problem  He was an eloquent spokesman for his point of view and no one can honestly doubt that Malcolm had a great concern for the problems that we face as a race  183  Elijah Muhammad told the annual Savior s Day convention on February 26   Malcolm X got just what he preached   while denying any involvement with the murder  184   We didn t want to kill Malcolm and didn t try to kill him   Muhammad said   We know such ignorant  foolish teachings would bring him to his own end   185  The New York Times wrote that Malcolm X was  an extraordinary and twisted man  who  turn ed  many true gifts to evil purpose  and that his life was  strangely and pitifully wasted   186  The New York Post wrote that  even his sharpest critics recognized his brilliance often wild  unpredictable and eccentric  but nevertheless possessing promise that must now remain unrealized   187  The international press  particularly that of Africa  was sympathetic  The Daily Times of Nigeria wrote that Malcolm X  will have a place in the palace of martyrs   188  The Ghanaian Times likened him to John Brown and Patrice Lumumba among  a host of Africans and Americans who were martyred in freedom s cause   189 Guangming Daily  published in Beijing  stated that  Malcolm was murdered because he fought for freedom and equal rights   190  while in Cuba  El Mundo described the assassination as  another racist crime to eradicate by violence the struggle against discrimination   191  Allegations of conspiracy Within days of the assassination  questions were raised about who bore ultimate responsibility  On February 23  James Farmer  the leader of the Congress of Racial Equality  announced at a news conference that local drug dealers  and not the Nation of Islam  were to blame  192  Others accused the NYPD  the FBI  or the CIA  citing the lack of police protection  the ease with which the assassins entered the Audubon Ballroom  and the failure of the police to preserve the crime scene  193  194  In the 1970s  the public learned about COINTELPRO and other secret FBI programs directed towards infiltrating and disrupting civil rights organizations during the 1950s and 1960s  195  John Ali  national secretary of the Nation of Islam  was identified as an FBI undercover agent  196  Malcolm X had confided in a reporter that Ali exacerbated tensions between him and Elijah Muhammad  He considered Ali his  archenemy  within the Nation of Islam leadership  196  On February 20  1965  the night before the assassination  Ali met with Talmadge Hayer  one of the men convicted of killing Malcolm X  197  In 1977 and 1978  Talmadge Hayer submitted two sworn affidavits re asserting his claim that Butler and Johnson were not involved in the assassination  In his affidavits Hayer named four men  all members of the Nation of Islam s Newark Temple Number 25  as having participated with him in the crime  Hayer asserted that a man  later identified as Wilbur McKinley  was the one who shouted and threw a smoke bomb to create a diversion  Hayer said that another man  later identified as William Bradley  had a shotgun and was the first to fire on Malcolm X after the diversion  Hayer asserted that he and a man later identified as Leon Davis  both armed with pistols  fired on Malcolm X immediately after the shotgun blast  Hayer also said that a fifth man  later identified as Benjamin Thomas  was involved in the conspiracy  198  199  Hayer s statements failed to convince authorities to reopen their investigation of the murder  200  Some  including the Shabazz family  have accused Louis Farrakhan of being involved in the plot to assassinate Malcolm X  201  202  203  204  In a 1993 speech  Farrakhan seemed to acknowledge the possibility that the Nation of Islam was responsible for the assassination  Was Malcolm your traitor or ours  And if we dealt with him like a nation deals with a traitor  what the hell business is it of yours  A nation has to be able to deal with traitors and cutthroats and turncoats  205  206  In a 60 Minutes interview that aired during May 2000  Farrakhan stated that some of the things he said may have led to the assassination of Malcolm X   I may have been complicit in words that I spoke   he said   I acknowledge that and regret that any word that I have said caused the loss of life of a human being   207  A few days later Farrakhan denied that he  ordered the assassination  of Malcolm X  although he again acknowledged that he  created the atmosphere that ultimately led to Malcolm X s assassination   208  No consensus on who was responsible has been reached  209  Philosophy Except for his autobiography  Malcolm X left no published writings  His philosophy is known almost entirely from the myriad speeches and interviews he gave from 1952 until his death in 1965  210  Many of those speeches  especially from the last year of his life  were recorded and have been published  211  Beliefs of the Nation of Islam Further information  Beliefs and theology of the Nation of Islam Before he left the Nation of Islam in 1964  Malcolm X taught its beliefs in his speeches  His speeches were peppered with the phrase  The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that      212  It is virtually impossible to discern whether Malcolm X s beliefs diverged from the teachings of the Nation of Islam  213  214  Malcolm X once compared himself to a ventriloquist s dummy who could only say what Elijah Muhammad told him  212  Malcolm X taught that black people were the original people of the world  86  and that white people were a race of devils who were created by an evil scientist named Yakub  87  The Nation of Islam believed that black people were superior to white people  and that the demise of the white race was imminent  88  When he was questioned concerning his statements that white people were devils  Malcolm X said that  history proves the white man is a devil   215  He enumerated some of the historical reasons that  he felt  supported his argument   Anybody who rapes  and plunders  and enslaves  and steals  and drops hell bombs on people    anybody who does these things is nothing but a devil   216  Malcolm X said that Islam was the  true religion of black mankind  and that Christianity was  the white man s religion  that had been imposed upon African Americans by their slave masters  217  He said that the Nation of Islam followed Islam as it was practiced around the world  but the Nation s teachings varied from those of other Muslims because they were adapted to the  uniquely pitiful  condition of black people in America  218  He taught that Wallace Fard Muhammad  the founder of the Nation  was Allah incarnate  219  and that Elijah Muhammad was his Messenger  or prophet  220  While the civil rights movement fought against racial segregation  Malcolm X advocated the complete separation of African Americans from white people  The Nation of Islam proposed the establishment of a separate country for black people in the Southern 89  or Southwestern United States 221  as an interim measure until African Americans could return to Africa  90  Malcolm X suggested the United States government owed reparations to black people for the unpaid labor of their enslaved ancestors  222  He also rejected the civil rights movement s strategy of nonviolence and instead advocated that black people should protect themselves by any necessary means  91  Independent views Malcolm X at a 1964 press conference After leaving the Nation of Islam  Malcolm X announced his willingness to work with leaders of the civil rights movement  112  though he felt that it should change its focus to human rights  So long as the movement remained a fight for civil rights  its struggle would remain a domestic issue  but by framing the struggle as a fight for human rights  it would become an international issue  and the movement could bring its complaint before the United Nations  Malcolm X said the emerging nations of the world would add their support to the cause of African Americans  223  Malcolm X declared that he and the other members of the Organization of Afro American Unity were determined to defend themselves from aggressors  and to secure freedom  justice and equality  by whatever means necessary   arguing that if the government was unwilling or unable to protect black people  they should protect themselves  224  Malcolm X stressed the global perspective he gained from his international travels  He emphasized the  direct connection  between the domestic struggle of African Americans for equal rights with the liberation struggles of Third World nations  225  He said that African Americans were wrong when they thought of themselves as a minority  in a global context  black people were a majority  not a minority  226  In his speeches at the Militant Labor Forum  which was sponsored by the Socialist Workers Party  Malcolm X criticized capitalism  147  After one such speech  when he was asked what political and economic system he wanted  he said he didn t know  but that it was no coincidence the newly liberated countries in the Third World were turning toward socialism  227  Malcolm X still was concerned primarily with the freedom struggle of African Americans  When a reporter asked him what he thought about socialism  Malcolm X asked whether it was good for black people  When the reporter told him it seemed to be  Malcolm X told him   Then I m for it   227  228  Although he no longer called for the separation of black people from white people  Malcolm X continued to advocate black nationalism  which he defined as self determination for the African American community  229  In the last months of his life  however  Malcolm X began to reconsider his support of black nationalism after meeting northern African revolutionaries who  to all appearances  were white  230  After his Hajj  Malcolm X articulated a view of white people and racism that represented a deep change from the philosophy he had supported as a minister of the Nation of Islam  In a famous letter from Mecca  he wrote that his experiences with white people during his pilgrimage convinced him to  rearrange  his thinking about race and  toss aside some of  his  previous conclusions   231  In a 1965 conversation with Gordon Parks  two days before his assassination  Malcolm said   L istening to leaders like Nasser  Ben Bella  and Nkrumah awakened me to the dangers of racism  I realized racism isn t just a black and white problem  It s brought bloodbaths to about every nation on earth at one time or another  Brother  remember the time that white college girl came into the restaurant the one who wanted to help the  Black  Muslims and the whites get together and I told her there wasn t a ghost of a chance and she went away crying  Well  I ve lived to regret that incident  In many parts of the African continent I saw white students helping black people  Something like this kills a lot of argument  I did many things as a  Black  Muslim that I m sorry for now  I was a zombie then like all  Black  Muslims I was hypnotized  pointed in a certain direction and told to march  Well  I guess a man s entitled to make a fool of himself if he s ready to pay the cost  It cost me 12 years  That was a bad scene  brother  The sickness and madness of those days I m glad to be free of them  232  Legacy Malcolm X has been described as one of the greatest and most influential African Americans in history  233  234  235  He is credited with raising the self esteem of black Americans and reconnecting them with their African heritage  236  He is largely responsible for the spread of Islam in the black community in the United States  237  238  239  Many African Americans  especially those who lived in cities in the Northern and Western United States  felt that Malcolm X articulated their complaints concerning inequality better than the mainstream civil rights movement did  93  94  One biographer says that by giving expression to their frustration  Malcolm X  made clear the price that white America would have to pay if it did not accede to black America s legitimate demands   240  In the late 1960s  as black activists became more radical  Malcolm X and his teachings were part of the foundation on which they built their movements  The Black Power movement  62  241  the Black Arts Movement  62  242  and the widespread adoption of the slogan  Black is beautiful  243  can all trace their roots to Malcolm X  During the late 1980s and early 1990s  there was a resurgence of interest in Malcolm X among young people  fueled in part by use of him as an icon by hip hop groups such as Public Enemy  244  245  His image was on display in hundreds of thousands of homes  offices  and schools  246  as well as on T shirts and jackets  247  This wave peaked in 1992 with the release of the film Malcolm X  248  an adaptation of the The Autobiography of Malcolm X which Malcolm X began in 1963 in collaboration with Alex Haley on The Autobiography of Malcolm X  114   Malcolm X had told Haley   If I m alive when this book comes out  it will be a miracle   249  indeed Haley completed and published it some months after the assassination   250  In 1998 Time named The Autobiography of Malcolm X one of the ten most influential nonfiction books of the 20th century  251  Portrayals in film and on stage Denzel Washington played the title role in Malcolm X 252  named one of the ten best films of the 1990s by both critic Roger Ebert and director Martin Scorsese  253  Washington had previously played the part of Malcolm X in the 1981 off Broadway play When the Chickens Came Home to Roost  254  Other portrayals include  James Earl Jones  in the 1977 film The Greatest  255  Dick Anthony Williams  in the 1978 television miniseries King 256  and the 1989 American Playhouse production of the Jeff Stetson play The Meeting  257  Al Freeman  Jr   in the 1979 television miniseries Roots  The Next Generations  258  Morgan Freeman  in the 1981 television movie Death of a Prophet  259  Ben Holt  in the 1986 opera X  The Life and Times of Malcolm X at the New York City Opera  260  Gary Dourdan  in the 2000 television movie King of the World  261  Joe Morton  in the 2000 television movie Ali  An American Hero  262  Mario Van Peebles  in the 2001 film Ali  263  Memorials and tributes The Malcolm X House Site  at 3448 Pinkney Street in North Omaha  Nebraska  marks the place where Malcolm Little first lived with his family  The house where the Little family lived was torn down in 1965 by owners who did not know of its connection with Malcolm X  264  The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 and a historic marker identifies the site because of the importance of Malcolm X to American history and national culture  265  266  In 1987 the site was added to the Nebraska register of historic sites and marked with a state plaque  267  Lansing  Michigan  where Malcolm Little spent his early  formative years  is home to a Michigan Historical Marker erected in 1975 marking his homesite  268  The city is also home to El Hajj Malik El Shabazz Academy  a public charter school with an Afrocentric focus  The Academy is located in the building where Little attended elementary school  269  Malcolm X Boulevard in New York City In cities around the world  Malcolm X s birthday  May 19  is commemorated as Malcolm X Day  The first known celebration of Malcolm X Day took place in Washington  D C   in 1971  270  The city of Berkeley  California  has recognized Malcolm X s birthday as a citywide holiday since 1979  271  Many cities have renamed streets after Malcolm X  in 1987  New York mayor Ed Koch proclaimed Lenox Avenue in Harlem to be Malcolm X Boulevard  272  The name of Reid Avenue in Brooklyn  New York  was changed to Malcolm X Boulevard in 1985  273  274  In 1997  Oakland Avenue in Dallas  Texas  was renamed Malcolm X Boulevard  275  Main Street in Lansing  Michigan  was renamed Malcolm X Street in 2010  276  There have been dozens of schools named after Malcolm X  including Malcolm X Shabazz High School in Newark  New Jersey  277 Malcolm Shabazz City High School in Madison  Wisconsin  278  and Malcolm X College in Chicago  Illinois  279  Meanwhile  the Malcolm X Library and Performing Arts Center of the San Diego Public Library system opened in 1996  It is the first library named after Malcolm X  280  The U S  Postal Service issued a Malcolm X postage stamp in 1999  281  In 2005  Columbia University announced the opening of the Malcolm X and Dr  Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center  The memorial is located in the Audubon Ballroom  where Malcolm X was assassinated  282  Collections of Malcolm X s papers are deposited at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and the Robert W  Woodruff Library  283  284  285  Recording found In February 2012  persons attending a Rhode Island Black Heritage Association event will have the opportunity to hear portions of a recording of Malcolm X s May 11  1961 Brown University speech  The recording was stored for 50 years and discovered by Brown student Malcolm Burnley  who saw the recording mentioned in an old student newspaper and searched for it in university archives  Katharine Pierce had written an article about the Black Muslim movement for a Pembroke College class  which Richard Holbrooke  editor of the student newspaper  used to inform people about race relations on the overwhelmingly white campus  The article inspired Malcolm X to visit the campus  where he spoke to a mostly white audience  stating that black people should remain separate and not depend on white people to offer them equality  286  Published works The

Lomax  When the Word Is Given  pp  79 80    Perry  p  203    King expressed mixed feelings toward Malcolm X   He is very articulate      but I totally disagree with many of his political and philosophical views    I don t want to seem to sound self righteous      or that I think I have the only truth  the only way  Maybe he does have some of the answer    I have often wished that he would talk less of violence  because violence is not going to solve our problem  And in his litany of articulating the despair of the Negro without offering any positive  creative alternative  I feel that Malcolm has done himself and our people a great disservice     U rging Negroes to arm themselves and prepare to engage in violence  as he has done  can reap nothing but grief   Haley  Alex  January
