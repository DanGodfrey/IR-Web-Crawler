the late 1920s  broadcasting in the United States was dominated by two companies  CBS and RCA s NBC  Before NBC s 1926 formation  RCA had acquired AT amp T s New York City station WEAF  later WNBC  now CBS owned WFAN   With WEAF came a loosely organized system feeding programming to other stations in the northeastern U S  RCA  before the acquisition of the WEAF group in mid 1926  had previously owned a second such group  with WJZ in Newark as the lead station  purchased by RCA in 1923 from Westinghouse    These were the foundations of RCA s two programming services  the NBC  Red  and NBC  Blue  networks  Legend has it that the color designations originated from the color of the push pins early engineers used to designate affiliates of WEAF  red pins  and WJZ  blue pins   After a three year investigation  the FCC in May 1940 issued a  Report on Chain Broadcasting   Finding that NBC Red  NBC Blue  CBS  and MBS dominated American broadcasting  this report proposed  divorcement   requiring the sale by RCA of one of its chains  NBC Red was the larger radio network  carrying the leading entertainment and music programs  In addition  many Red affiliates were high powered  clear channel stations  heard nationwide  NBC Blue offered most of the company s news and cultural programs  many of them  sustaining  or unsponsored  Among other findings  the FCC claimed RCA used NBC Blue to suppress competition against NBC Red  The FCC did not regulate or license networks directly  but it could influence them by its licensing of individual stations  Consequently  the FCC issued a ruling that  no license shall be issued to a standard broadcast station affiliated with a network which maintains more than one network   NBC argued this indirect style of regulation was illegal and appealed to the courts  However  the FCC won on appeal  and on January 8  1942 NBC decided to separate its Red and Blue networks with the intention of divesting itself of the latter  2  The task of selling of NBC Blue was given to Mark Woods  throughout 1942 and 1943  NBC Red and NBC Blue divided their assets  A price of  8 million was put on the Blue group  and Woods shopped Blue around to potential buyers  One such  investment bank Dillon  Read made an offer of  7 5 million  but Woods and RCA chief David Sarnoff held firm at  8 million  The Blue package contained leases on land lines and on studio facilities in New York  Washington  D C   Chicago and Los Angeles  contracts with talent and with about sixty affiliates  the trademark and  good will  associated with the Blue name  and licenses for three stations  WJZ in New York  San Francisco s KGO  and WENR in Chicago   really a half station  since WENR shared time and a frequency with  Prairie Farmer  station WLS  with which it would later merge under full ABC ownership in 1954   RCA finally found a buyer in Edward Noble  owner of Life Savers candy and the Rexall drugstore chain  In order to complete the station license transfer  Noble had to sell his New York radio station  WMCA  Controversy ensued at FCC hearings over Noble s intention to keep Mark Woods on as president  which led to the suggestion that Woods would continue to work with  and for  his former employers  This had the potential to derail the sale  During the hearings  Woods said the new network would not sell airtime to the American Federation of Labor  Noble evaded questioning on similar points by hiding behind the NAB code  Frustrated  the chairman advised Noble to do some rethinking  Apparently he did  and the sale closed on October 12  1943  The new network  known as  The Blue Network   was owned by the American Broadcasting System  a company Noble formed for the deal  3  It sold airtime to organized labor  In September  1944  Noble acquired the rights to the names  American Broadcasting Company   from the licensee of WOL    American Broadcasting Corporation   from the licensee of WLAP   and  American Network   from a defunct group of FM broadcasters   clearing the way to rename American Broadcasting System to American Broadcasting Company  with the Blue becoming  ABC   4  This set off a flurry of renaming  to avoid confusion  CBS changed the call letters of its New York flagship  WABC 880  to WCBS in 1946  In 1953  WJZ in New York and its sister television station took on the abandoned call letters WABC and WABC TV   Westinghouse later reclaimed the WJZ callsign when it acquired a Baltimore television station in 1959  WJZ TV in Baltimore  and its sister radio station  are now owned by CBS   ABC Radio began slowly  with few hit shows or big name stars  it had to build an audience  Noble acquired more stations  among them Detroit s WXYZ  an NBC  Blue  ABC affiliate since 1935  WXYZ was originator of several daily serials  among them The Lone Ranger  Sergeant Preston and The Green Hornet  although these programs were not included in the sale   Noble also bought KECA  now KABC  in Los Angeles  to give the network a Hollywood production base  Counter programming became an ABC specialty  for example  placing a raucous quiz show like Stop the Music  against more thoughtful fare on NBC and CBS  Industry policy forbade the use of pre recorded programs  adapting the advanced tape recording brought back from conquered Germany  ABC attracted some big name stars who wanted freedom from rigid schedules  among them Bing Crosby  Though still rated fourth  by the late 1940s ABC had begun to close in on the better established networks   edit  1948  Leonard Goldenson and ABC s entry into television Faced with the expenses of building a radio network  ABC was in no position to take on the additional costs demanded by television  Yet to secure a place at the table  in 1947 ABC submitted requests for licenses in the five cities where it owned radio stations  which together represented 25 percent of the entire nationwide viewing audience at the time   All five requests were for each station to broadcast on channel 7  Frank Marx  ABC s vice president in charge of engineering  thought at the time that the low band  channels 2 through 6  TV channels would be reallocated for military use  thus making these five stations broadcasting on VHF channel 7 the lowest on the TV dial and therefore the best channel positions  5   Such a move never occurred  although fortuitously  60 years later the Channel 7 frequency would prove technically favorable for digital television transmission  a technology unanticipated at the dawn of TV broadcasting   The ABC television network went on the air on April 19  1948  The network picked up its first primary affiliates  WFIL TV in Philadelphia  now WPVI TV  and WMAL TV in Washington  now WJLA TV  before its flagship owned and operated station   O amp O    WJZ TV in New York  now WABC TV  signed on in August of that year  The rest of ABC s fleet of owned and operated major market stations  in Detroit  Chicago  San Francisco and Los Angeles  would sign on during the next 13 months  giving it parity with CBS and NBC in the important area of big city presence  as well as a long term advantage in guaranteed reach over the rival DuMont Television Network  by the fall of 1949  For the next few years  ABC was a television network mostly in name  Except for the largest markets  most cities had only one or two stations  The FCC froze applications for new stations in 1948 while it sorted out the thousands of applicants and re thought the technical and allocation standards set down between 1938 and 1946  What was meant to be a six month freeze lasted until the middle of 1952  Until that time there were only 108 stations in the United States  Some large cities where TV development was slow  like Pittsburgh and St  Louis  had only one station on the air for a prolonged period  many more of the largest cities such as Boston only had two  and many sizable cities including Denver  Colorado and Portland  Oregon had no television service at all until the second half of 1952 after the freeze ended  For a late comer like ABC  this meant being relegated to secondary status in many markets and no reach at all in some  ABC commanded little affiliate loyalty  though unlike fellow startup network DuMont  it at least had a radio network on which to draw loyalty and revenue  It also had a full complement of five O amp Os  which included stations in the critical Chicago  WENR TV  now WLS TV  and Los Angeles  KECA TV  now KABC TV  markets  Even then  by 1951 ABC found itself badly overextended and on the verge of bankruptcy  It had only nine full time affiliates to augment its five O amp Os WJZ  WENR  KECA  WXYZ TV in Detroit and KGO TV in San Francisco  ABC TV logo from 1946 Noble finally found a white knight in United Paramount Theaters  Divorced from Paramount Pictures at the end of 1949 by the U S  Supreme Court decision United States v  Paramount Pictures  Inc   UPT was cash rich and controlled much valuable real estate  UPT head Leonard Goldenson set out to find investment opportunities  Barred from the film business  Goldenson saw broadcasting as a possibility  and approached Noble in 1951 about buying ABC  Noble was being approached by other suitors  including Bill Paley s CBS  so he was not in a hurry to accommodate Goldenson  After some tough negotiations  a merger with UPT was eventually agreed to in principle and announced in the late spring of 1951  6  Since the transfer of station licenses was again involved  the FCC set hearings  which proved to be contentious  The FCC focused on the Paramount Pictures UPT divorce  were they truly separate  What role did Paramount s long time investment in DuMont Laboratories  parent of the television network  play  After a year of deliberation the FCC finally approved the purchase by UPT in a 5 2 split decision on February 9  1953  Speaking in favor of the deal  one commissioner pointed out that UPT had the cash to turn ABC into a viable  competitive third network  The corporate name became American Broadcasting Paramount Theatres  Inc  Edward Noble remained on the new ABC s board of directors until his death in 1958  he and Goldenson would disagree at times over the direction ABC would now take  Robert Kintner  the network president originally hired by Noble  was forced out by 1956 despite Noble s vigorous objections  as Goldenson and the executives he brought on board eventually took solid command  Shortly after the ABC UPT merger  Goldenson approached DuMont with a merger offer  DuMont was in financial trouble for a number of reasons  not the least of which was an FCC ruling that barred it from acquiring two additional O amp Os because of two stations owned by Paramount  However  DuMont s pioneering status in television and programming creativity gave it a leg up on ABC  and for a time appeared that DuMont was about to establish itself as the third television network  This all changed with the ABC UPT merger  which effectively placed DuMont on life support  Goldenson and DuMont s managing director  Ted Bergmann  quickly agreed to a deal  Under the proposed merger  the merged network would have been called  ABC DuMont  for at least five years  DuMont would get  5 million in cash and guaranteed advertising time for DuMont television receivers  In return  ABC agreed to honor all of DuMont s network commitments  The merged network would have been a colossus rivaling CBS and NBC  with O amp Os in five of the six largest markets  all except Philadelphia  which would later become an O  amp  O   It would have had to sell either WJZ TV or DuMont flagship WABD TV  now WNYW  as well as two other stations  most likely WXYZ TV and KGO TV  in order to comply with the FCC s five station limit  The merged network would have also acquired the aforementioned monopoly in Pittsburgh with DuMont owned WDTV  now KDKA TV  and ironically now a CBS O amp O  being part of the merger  However  Paramount vetoed the sale  A few months earlier  the FCC ruled that Paramount controlled DuMont  and there were still lingering questions about whether the two companies were truly separate  By 1956  the DuMont network had shut down  After its acquisition by UPT  ABC at last had the means to offer a full time television network service on the scale of CBS and NBC  By mid 1953  Goldenson had begun a two front campaign  calling on his old pals at the Hollywood studios  he had been head of the mighty Paramount theater chain since 1938  to convince them to move into television programming  within a few years shifting television programming from predominantly live shows from New York to films made for television in Hollywood   And he began wooing station owners to convince them that a refurbished ABC was about to burst forth  He also convinced long time NBC and CBS affiliates in several markets to move to ABC  His two part campaign paid off when the  new  ABC hit the air on October 27  1954  Among the shows that brought in record audiences was Disneyland  produced by and starring Walt Disney   the beginning of a relationship between the studio and the network which would eventually  four decades later  transform them both  MGM  Warner Bros  and Twentieth Century Fox were also present that first season  Within two years  Warner Bros  was producing ten hours of programming for ABC each week  mostly interchangeable detective and western series  including Cheyenne  Maverick  77 Sunset Strip  Surfside 6  Bronco  Hawaiian Eye  and Colt  45  The middle 1950s saw ABC finally have shows in the top 10 including Disneyland  Other early hit series on ABC during this period which helped establish the network included The Lone Ranger  ABC s only Top 10 show before Disneyland   The Adventures Of Ozzie And Harriet   starring the real life Nelson family   Leave It To Beaver  which moved over from CBS   The Detectives and The Untouchables  In 1955  the network picked up the national broadcast rights to KTLA s Dodge Dancing Party  which eventually evolved into The Lawrence Welk Show  becoming an ABC fixture throughout the late 1950s and 1960s  However  it still had a long way to go  It was relegated to secondary status in many markets until the late 1960s and  in a few cases  into the 1980s  In 1955  ABC established a recording division  the AmPar Record Corporation  7  which founded and operated the popular label ABC Paramount Records  which became ABC Records in 1965  and the noted jazz label Impulse Records  created in 1961  ABC Paramount subsequently purchased more labels from the Famous Music division of Gulf Western   Dot  Steed  Acta  Blue Thumb  and Paramount  along with legendary Country and R amp B label Duke Peacock in 1974  The entire group was sold to MCA Records in 1979  as a result of subsequent takeovers  the remnants of the ABC music group are now owned by Universal Music Group  After the merger with Disney  ABC became sister company to a record label group once again  the Buena Vista Music Group  which includes such labels as Walt Disney Records and Hollywood Records    edit  1961 1965  Growth and restructuring While ABC TV continued to languish in third place nationally  it often topped local ratings in the larger markets  With the arrival of Hollywood s slickly produced series  ABC began to catch on with younger  urban viewers that advertisers wanted to reach  At the same time  a series of regulatory moves by the FCC opened up the more desirable VHF band for additional full power stations in sizable Eastern and Midwestern mrkets between 1958 and 1963  allowing ABC to acquire full time affiliation agreements with additional full coverage stations in key parts of the country  This would permit the network to build for further nationwide audience growth in the coming decade  As the network gained in the ratings  it became an attractive property  and over the next few years ABC approached  or was approached  by GE  Howard Hughes  Litton Industries  GTE and ITT  ABC and ITT agreed to a merger in late 1965  but this deal was derailed by FCC and Department of Justice questions about ITT s foreign ownership influencing ABC s autonomy and journalistic integrity  ITT s management promised that ABC s autonomy would be preserved  While it was able to convince the FCC  antitrust regulators at the Justice Department refused to sign off on the deal  After numerous delays  the deal was called off on January 1  1968  ABC would remain an independent company for almost another two decades  By 1960  the ABC Radio Network found its audience continuing to gravitate to television  The ABC owned radio stations were not enjoying very large audiences either  with the exception of Detroit s WXYZ  which had reinvented itself as a hit based contemporary music station two years earlier under the guidance of Harold L  Neal and found renewed success  Seeing that WXYZ was the only one of ABC s radio stations making money at the time  and with a decline in listenership and far less network programming at ABC s other stations  Neal  after moving to WABC in New York to become general manager of that station  hired Mike Joseph  later known for developing the Hot Hits format  as Music Consultant to program contemporary Top 40 music on WABC  Neal also hired Dan Ingram to host the afternoon time period and hired Bruce  Cousin Brucie  Morrow to host early evenings on WABC  WABC s immediate success lead to Neal being named President of all 7 ABC owned radio stations  Neal then spread the popular music programming to WLS Chicago and KQV Pittsburgh and they attained very large audiences  ABC s KABC Los Angeles and KGO San Francisco pioneered news talk programming and became quite successful  WXYZ  WABC  WLS and KQV would also later shift to news talk programming some years later   Rick Sklar was hired by Neal in 1963 to program the station  which by the mid 1960s featured hourly newscasts  commentaries and a few long running serials  which were all that remained on the ABC Radio Network schedule  Don McNeill s daily  Breakfast Club  variety show was among the offerings  Romper Room  a children s learning show was featured  both in New York and in ABC subsidiaries  with Nancy Terrell as  Miss Nancy   On September 23  1962  ABC began televising the animated television series The Jetsons in color  Another animated show  The Flintstones  had been filmed in color since its debut in 1960 and was soon shown in color on the network  In the 1965 66 season  ABC joined NBC and CBS in televising most of its shows in color  In 1967  WLS General Manager  Ralph Beaudin  was promoted to head up ABC Radio  Beaudin made the bold move on January 1  1968  when he split the ABC Radio Network into four new  networks   each one with format specific news and features for pop music   news   or talk oriented stations  The  American  Contemporary  Entertainment  Information and FM networks were later joined by two others   Direction and Rock  During 1968  KXYZ and KXYZ FM in Houston were acquired by ABC  giving the network the maximum seven owned and operated AM and FM stations allowed at the time  In 1969  Neal and Beaudin hired former WCFL Chicago programmer  Allen Shaw  to program the seven ABC Owned FM Radio stations  Shaw pioneered the first album oriented rock format on all seven stations and changed their call letters to WPLJ New York  WDAI Chicago  WDVE Pittsburgh  WRIF Detroit  KAUM Houston  KSFX San Francisco and KLOS Los Angeles  By the mid 1970s  the ABC owned AM and FM stations  and the ABC Radio Network were the most successful radio operations in America in terms of audience and profits  Leonard Goldenson often credited ABC Radio for helping fund the development of ABC Television in those early years  During this period of the 1960s  ABC founded an in house production unit  ABC Films  to create new material especially for the network  Shortly after the death of producer David O  Selznick  ABC acquired the rights to a considerable amount of the Selznick theatrical film library  including Rebecca and Portrait of Jennie  but not including Gone with the Wind  which Metro Goldwyn Mayer had acquired outright in the 1940s    edit  1965 1969  Success The 2 D ABC logo designed by Paul Rand and used from 1962 until 2007  Now a secondary logo  it is still used in print advertisements  Wide World of Sports debuted April 29  1961 and was the creation of Edgar J  Scherick through his company  Sports Programs  Inc  After selling his company to the American Broadcasting Company  Scherick hired a young Roone Arledge to produce the show  Arledge would eventually go on to become the executive producer of ABC Sports  as well as president of ABC News   Arledge helped ABC s fortunes with innovations in sports programming  such as the multiple cameras used in Monday Night Football  By doing so  he helped to make sports broadcasting into a multi billion dollar industry  Despite its relatively small size  ABC found increasing success with television programming aimed at the emerging  Baby Boomer  culture  It broadcast American Bandstand and Shindig   two shows that featured new popular and youth oriented records of the day  The network ran science fiction fare  a genre that other networks considered too risky  The Outer Limits  The Invaders  The Time Tunnel and Land of the Giants  It also ran the Quinn Martin action and suspense series The F B I  and The Fugitive  In January 1966  an unheralded mid season replacement show became a national pop culture phenomenon  Batman  starring Adam West as the Caped Crusader and Burt Ward as his youthful sidekick Robin the Boy Wonder  helped establish ABC as a TV force with which to be reckoned  Each week  a two part Batman adventure aired on Wednesday and Thursday nights  blending the exploits of the popular comic book hero with off the wall  camp  humor  The unusual combination made the series an immediate hit with thrill seeking youngsters  and a cult favorite on high school and college campuses  Special guest villains such as Cesar Romero  the Joker   Burgess Meredith  the Penguin   Julie Newmar and Eartha Kitt  Catwoman  and Joan Collins  the Siren  added to the show s mass appeal  A two part episode featuring Liberace in a dual role  as the great pianist Chandel and his criminal twin brother Harry  would prove to be the highest rated Batman tandem of the series  Batman ended its run on March 1968  In 1968  the parent company changed its name from American Broadcasting Paramount Theatres  Inc  to American Broadcasting Companies  Inc   formally dropping the Paramount name from the company and all subsidiaries which bore that name  The network would continue to have an association with Paramount Television in the 1970s  however many of its television programs would come from Paramount  and most of the shows would bring ABC great success in the ratings   edit  1969 1985  Rising to the top Continuing the network s upswing in the 1960s were highly rated primetime sitcoms such as That Girl  Bewitched  The Courtship of Eddie s Father  The Partridge Family and The Brady Bunch  and dramas such as Room 222 and The Mod Squad  Edgar J  Scherick was Vice President of Network Programming and responsible for much of the lineup during this era  ABC s daytime lineup became strong throughout the 1970s and 1980s with the soap operas General Hospital  One Life to Live  The Edge of Night  which had moved to ABC from CBS in late 1975   All My Children  and Ryan s Hope  and the game shows The Dating Game  The Newlywed Game  Let s Make a Deal  Split Second  The  20 000 Pyramid and Family Feud  By the early 1970s  ABC had formed its first theatrical division  ABC Pictures  later renamed ABC Motion Pictures  It made some moneymaking films like Bob Fosse s Cabaret  Woody Allen s Take the Money and Run  and Sydney Pollack s They Shoot Horses  Don t They   while other films like Song of Norway and Candy  were critical and box office disasters upon release despite them both being heavily promoted while still in production  The company s later movies included Silkwood  The Flamingo Kid and SpaceCamp  the latter was the last movie ABC produced for cinemas   They also started an innovation in television  the concept of the ABC Movie of the Week  This series of made for TV films aired once per week on Tuesday nights  Three years later  Wednesday nights were added as well  Palomar Pictures International  the production company created by Scherick after leaving ABC  produced several of the Movies of the Week  The network itself  meanwhile  was showing signs of overtaking CBS and NBC  Broadcasting in color from the mid 1960s  ABC started using the new science of demographics to tweak its programming and ad sales  ABC invested heavily in shows with wide appeal  especially situation comedies such as Happy Days  Barney Miller  Three s Company  Taxi and Soap  Programming head Fred Silverman was credited with reversing the network s fortunes by spinning off shows such as Laverne  amp  Shirley and Mork and Mindy  He also commissioned series from Aaron Spelling such as Charlie s Angels  Starsky and Hutch  S W A T  Hart to Hart  The Love Boat  Family  Vega   and Dynasty  Furthermore  ABC acquired broadcasting rights for telecasting the annual Academy Awards ceremony in 1976  which today is contractually planned to do so until 2014  By 1977  ABC had become the nation s highest rated network  Meanwhile CBS and NBC ranked behind for some time  and due to NBC ranking third place  ABC sought stronger affiliates by having former NBC affiliations swap networks for ABC  ABC also offered big budget  extended length miniseries  among them QB VII  and Rich Man  Poor Man  The most successful  Roots  based on Alex Haley s novel  became one of the biggest hits in television history  Combined with ratings for its regular weekly series  Roots propelled ABC to a first place finish in the national Nielsen ratings for the 1976 1977 season   this was a first in the then thirty year history of the network  In 1983  via its revived theatrical division  ABC Motion Pictures  Silkwood was released in theaters  and The Day After  again produced in house by its by then retitled television unit  ABC Circle Films  was viewed on TV by 100 million people  prompting discussion of nuclear activities taking place at the time  Another ABC Television Movie  Battlestar Galactica  which spawned the 1978 television series of the same name  was seen by 64 million people and at the time was the most expensive TV movie ever made  ABC TV began the transition from coaxial cable microwave delivery to satellite delivery via AT amp T s Telstar 301  ABC maintained a West Coast feed network on Telstar 302 and  in 1991  scrambled feeds on both satellites with the Leitch system  Currently  with the Leitch system abandoned  ABC operates digital feeds on Intelsat Galaxy 16 and Intelsat Galaxy 3C  ABC Radio began using the SEDAT satellite distribution system in the mid 1980s  switching to Starguide in the early 2000s  In 1984  ABC acquired majority control of 24 hour cable sports channel ESPN   edit  1985 1996  The Capital Cities era ABC s dominance carried into the early 1980s  But by 1985  veteran shows like The Love Boat and Benson had run their courses  while Silverman era hits like Three s Company and Laverne  amp  Shirley were gone  As a resurgent NBC was leading in the ratings  ABC shifted its focus to such situation comedies as Webster  Mr  Belvedere  Growing Pains  and Perfect Strangers  During this period  while the network enjoyed huge ratings with shows like Dynasty  Moonlighting  MacGyver  Who s The Boss   The Wonder Years  Hotel  and Thirtysomething  ABC seemed to have lost the momentum that propelled it in the 1970s  there was little offered that was innovative or compelling  Highly hyped shows built around big name stars like Lucille Ball and Dolly Parton were critical and commercial failures during the mid  to late 1980s  Like his counterpart at CBS  William S  Paley  founding father Goldenson had withdrawn to the sidelines  ABC s ratings and the earnings thus generated reflected this loss of drive  Under the circumstances  ABC was a ripe takeover target  However  no one expected the buyer to be a media company only a tenth the size of ABC  Capital Cities Communications  ABC was acquired by Capital Cities in 1986 for  3 5 billion dollars  changing its corporate name to Capital Cities ABC  8  The acquisition was engineered by two Capital Cities executives  Capital Cities Chairman Tom Murphy and Daniel Burke  8  Burke became President and Chief Executive of ABC  running the daily operations of the network until his retirement in 1994  8  Murphy focused on the network s long term goals and strategies  8  Murphy and Burke are credited with streamlining ABC s operations and increasing profitability  8  As the 1990s began  one could conclude the company was more conservative than at other times in its history  The miniseries faded off  Saturday morning cartoons were phased out  But the network did acquire Orion Pictures  television division in the wake of the studio s bankruptcy  after a brief attempt at acquiring the studio itself   later merging it with its in house division ABC Circle Films to create ABC Productions  Shows produced during this era included My So Called Life  The Commish  and American Detective  the last program mentioned was co produced through Orion before the studio s bankruptcy   In an attempt to win viewers on Friday night  the TGIF programming block was created  The lead programs of this time included Full House  Family Matters  and Step by Step  These shows were family oriented  but other shows such as Roseanne were less traditional in their worldview  but were very successful in the ratings  Home Improvement also strengthened ABC s ratings  as it was constantly rated in the top 10 of the Nielsen s Ranking Chart until its finale in 1999   edit  1996 2003  Disney purchase and network decline In 1996  The Walt Disney Company acquired Capital Cities ABC  and renamed the broadcasting group ABC  Inc   although the network continues to also use American Broadcasting Companies  such as on TV productions it owns  ABC s relationship with Disney dates back to 1953  when Leonard Goldenson pledged enough money so that the  Disneyland  theme park could be completed  ABC continued to hold Disney notes and stock until 1960  and also had first call on the  Disneyland  television series in 1954  With this new relationship came an attempt at cross promotion  with attractions based on ABC shows at Disney parks and an annual soap festival at Walt Disney World   The former president of ABC  Inc   Robert Iger  now heads Disney   In 1997  ABC aired a Saturday morning block called One Saturday Morning which changed to ABC Kids in 2002  It featured a 5 hour line up of children s shows  mostly cartoons  for children ages 5 12  but it was changed to a 4 hour line up in 2005  Since then  it was aimed for children more in the 10 16 range  Despite intense micro managing on the part of Disney management  the flagship television network was slow to turn around  In 1999  the network was able to experience a brief bolster in ratings with the hit game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire  A new national phenomenon  Survivor  on CBS persuaded the schedulers at ABC to change Millionaire s slot over to the Wednesday Time slot at 8 00 to kill Survivor before it got a ratings hold  The first results were promising for CBS  they lost by only a few ratings points  ABC tried an unprecedented strategy for Millionaire by airing the show four times a week during the next Fall season  in the process overexposing the show  as it appeared on the network sometimes five or six nights during a week  ABC s ratings fell dramatically as competitors introduced their own game shows and the public grew tired of the format  Alex Wallau took over as president in 2000  Despite the repeated overexposure of Millionaire and its switch to syndication  ABC continued to find some success in dramas such as The Practice  which gave birth to a successful spinoff  Boston Legal  in 2004   Alias  and Once and Again  ABC also had some moderately successful comedies including The Drew Carey Show  Spin City  Dharma  amp  Greg  According to Jim  My Wife and Kids  8 Simple Rules and The George Lopez Show  For the 2001 2002 television season  ABC began airing newer scripted programming in High Definition  in addition  the network also converted all of its existing situation comedies and drama programming to HD  making it the first such American television network to produce its entire slate of scripted programming in that format  CBS became the first television network to produce programming in High Definition a year earlier  In 2002  ABC committed over  35 million to build an automated Network Release  NR  facility in New York to distribute programming to its affiliates  This facility  however  was designed to handle only standard definition broadcasts  not the modern HDTV  so it was obsolete before construction began  NR s biggest error  to date  is the loss of several minutes of the Dancing with the Stars results show live telecast on March 27  2007 to 104 affiliates  The previous biggest blunder was the airing of A Charlie Brown Christmas in December 2006 with several acts in the wrong order  In 2008 ABC committed  70 million to build a new HDTV facility  NR s standard definition operations shut down in the week before the revised digital television transition mandated by the U S  Federal Communications Commission  FCC  on June 12  ABC only has 5 working control rooms for HDTV  and two of them are dual edit control suites  A fifth break studio  HD 5  was put into service in August 2009  Still one asset that ABC lacked in the early 2000s that most other networks had was popularity in reality television  ABC s briefly lived reality shows Are You Hot  and the first American iteration of I m a Celebrity    Get Me Out of Here  proved to be an embarrassment for the network  By end of the 2003 2004 television season  ABC slumped to fourth place  becoming the first of the original  Big Three  networks to fall to such a ranking   edit  2004 2007  Resurgence Determined not to lose its prominence on TV  ABC was able to find success in ratings beginning in 2004  Under new entertainment president Stephen McPherson  in the fall of that year ABC premiered two highly anticipated series Desperate Housewives  and Lost  Immediately  the network s ratings skyrocketed to unprecedented levels thanks in part to the shows  critical praises  high publicity  and heavy marketing over the summer  It followed up its prosperity with the premieres of Grey s Anatomy in 2005  and in 2006  the dramedy Ugly Betty  the last mentioned program is based on a popular international telenovela   which were all popular among viewers and critically acclaimed  ABC finally found reality television prosperity first with Extreme Makeover  Home Edition in 2003 and then with Dancing with the Stars in 2005  In spite of these newfound successes ABC continues to flounder in creating new reality television series  Particularly during the summer months  ABC has repeatedly attempted to launch new unscripted shows such as Shaq s Big Challenge  Fat March  and Brat Camp  One show of note in ABC s attempt to expand its reality TV brand was the rebuttal of Fox s enormously popular American Idol  The One  Making a Music Star  which attempted to combine a talent competition with a traditional reality show  The show came in response to 5 years of utter dominance by American Idol over even ABC s most popular shows  However  The One received unanimously negative reviews  pulled some of the lowest ratings in TV history  and was canceled after only two weeks  Through the early 2000s  the ABC Sports division and ESPN merged operations  ESPN  which had been broadcasting its own popular package of Sunday night games since 1987  took over the Monday Night Football franchise in 2006   NBC began showing its own series of games on Sunday nights in ESPN s old timeslot   Beginning that fall  all sports broadcasts on ABC would be presented under the  ESPN on ABC  banner  with ESPN graphics and announcers  including both the ESPN and ABC logos on screen  ESPN in the presentation graphics with an ABC bug in the corner of the screen   ABC aired the miniseries The Path to 9 11 in September 2006 on the fifth anniversary of the September 11  2001 terrorist attacks  The docudrama was widely criticized  especially from the left  for its alleged inaccuracies  Borrowing a proven Disney formula  there have been attempts to broaden the ABC brand name  In 2004  ABC launched a news channel called ABC News Now  Its aim is to provide round the clock news on over the air digital TV  cable TV  the Internet  and mobile phones  With the Disney merger  Touchstone Television began to produce the bulk of ABC s primetime series  This culminated in the studio s name change to ABC Studios in 2007  as part of a Disney strategy to focus on the 3  core brands   ABC  Disney  and ESPN  Buena Vista Television  the studio s syndication arm also changed their name  to Disney ABC Domestic Television  Also in 2007  ABC unveiled a new  glossier logo and their new imaging campaign  revolving around the slogan ABC  Start Here  which signifies the network s news content and entertainment programming being accessible through not only television  but also the Internet  portable media devices  podcasting  and mobile device specific content from the network  9  But despite all this  and a few more successes such as Brothers  amp  Sisters  Grey s Anatomy spin off Private Practice  and summer game show smash Wipeout  the resurgence would not last  as ABC would fall from second to third place in 2007   edit  2007 present  The writers  strike and loss of steam While the writer s strike of 2007 2008 put a damper on ABC s schedule during this season as with other networks  it was particularly bad on most of the network s new pilots  with many of them  Dirty Sexy Money  Pushing Daisies  and Samantha Who  among others  not living to see a third season after the 2008 2009 season  Although to a lesser extent  the writers  strike continued to affect the network in the 2008 2009 season  as more series such as Boston Legal and the U S  version of Life on Mars suffered from low viewership  despite the former being a once highlighted breakout show on the network  10  In early 2009  Disney ABC Television Group merged ABC Entertainment and ABC Studios into a new division called ABC Entertainment Group  which would be responsible for both production and broadcasting  11  12  13  14  15  Disney ABC Television Group planned to reduce its workforce by 5  during this reorganization  16  The 2009 2010 season would be a season of contrasts for ABC  The network notably made Wednesday nights that fall consist entirely of new programming  out of the five shows premiered  three of them  Cougar Town  The Middle  and Modern Family  the most successful and critically acclaimed of them   would be renewed for a second season  these half hour comedies forming ABC s new  Comedy Wednesday  block  branded  Laugh On  by the network   On the flip side however  by the end of the season  the network ultimately cancelled every single new drama that season except for V  although Castle  a midseason replacement from the previous season and one of ABC s only successful procedurals to date  was also renewed  NBC would nearly tie ABC  thanks to help from the 2010 Winter Olympics  for third place that year in viewings  citation needed  In March 2010  Disney has considered spinning ABC off into an independent broadcasting company because   it doesn t add a lot of value to Disney s other divisions   17  They entered advanced negotiations with two private equity firms to sell ABC  however  the sale was canceled because of an attempted insider trade to the FBI by an ex employee  18  In 2010  Lost finally ended after season six  its lowest rated since its inception in 2004  The once instant hit show Ugly Betty collapsed dramatically in ratings due to its move to the infamous Friday night death slot  Even after an attempt to boost ratings by moving it to Wednesday nights  the show was ultimately cancelled  resulting in negative reactions from the public  and particularly from the show s fanbase  19  With the network s two former hit shows now out of the picture  the network s remaining top two veteran shows Desperate Housewives and Grey s Anatomy  and another hit show Brothers  amp  Sisters  then record their lowest ratings ever  a trademark that still continued into their 2010 2011 television schedule  Similarly  their dramas for 2010 2011 continued to fail  with only Body of Proof being renewed for a second season  20  The network also struggled to establish new comedies to go with the previous year s debuts  with only late season premiere Happy Endings earning a second season  20  Meanwhile  the new lows hit by Brothers  amp  Sisters led to its cancellation  21  and the previous year s only drama renewal  V  also failed to earn another season after a low rated mid season run  21  Despite this and another noticeable ratings decline  ABC would manage to outrate NBC for third by a larger margin than the previous year  22  With the combination of relatively little buzz surrounding its 2010 2011 pilots  compounded by a sexual harassment suit against him  Stephen McPherson resigned as ABC Entertainment Group president on July 27  2010  His replacement  Paul Lee  was announced the same day  23  24  With the cancellation of Supernanny in 2011  Extreme Makeover  Home Edition was the only series to be broadcast in 4 3 standard definition on the network s schedule before ending in series form in January 2012  Since the launch of ABC s gloss logo in September 2008  ABC has suggested network affiliates integrate the ABC logomark within their station logos  with ABC s O amp O s being the first to comply  This is to allow both simpler common branding among affiliates and the network  and to allow ABC to brand their video players on ABC com and Hulu with the local station logo as the digital on screen bug  which is determined by ZIP code and IP address  along with the local affiliate logo after a network commercial break  Philadelphia s WPVI TV was the last O amp O to forgo obvious or non standard ABC branding until December 2010  instead using a red two toned ABC ball to go with their graphics coloring   when the station placed their longtime  6  logo within a Circle 7 esque blue circle with the ABC gloss logo to the bottom right  Some ABC affiliates use their ABC logo forms only to advertise ABC programming  with unbranded station logos for the remainder of their broadcast day  ABC is also unique in the industry for branding their shows as  ABC s  Name of Program   in promotional advertising  in line with parent corporation Disney s  e g  Pixar s  Marvel s  upfront branding on their television shows and films  and for productions by ABC Studios having the words  An ABC Studios Production  placed in the opening credits after a program s title card  before the listing of actors   edit  History with Disney In 1954  the Walt Disney anthology television series  under the title Disneyland  began showing not only programs made exclusively for television by the Disney studio  but also edited versions of some of the studio s theatrical films  such as Alice in Wonderland  Occasionally  a full length film would be shown  such as Treasure Island  but these would be divided into two one hour episodes  Disneyland  which premiered in conjunction with the impending opening of Disney s theme park of the same name  changed its name to Walt Disney Presents in 1958  Walt Disney had long wanted ABC to broadcast his show in color  but the network still cash strapped balked at the idea because of the cost of color broadcasting  In 1961  Walt Disney struck a deal with NBC to move the show to their network  At the time  NBC was owned by RCA  who was promoting color at the time in order to sell their color TV sets  The show moved in the fall of 1961 and was renamed Walt Disney s Wonderful World of Color allowing Disney to broadcast in color  including shows that had previously been run in black and white on ABC  It became one of the longest running TV series of all time  The show was revived twice  once in 1986 and again in 1997  both times on ABC  though the first revival moved to NBC in 1988 where it lasted two more years    edit  Sale of ABC Radio Through the 1980s and 1990s  as radio s music audience continued to drift to FM  many of ABC s heritage AM stations the powerhouse properties upon which the company was founded  like WABC New York and WLS Chicago switched from music to talk  While many of ABC s radio stations and network programs remained strong revenue producers  growth in the radio industry began to slow dramatically after the dot com boom of the early 2000s and the consolidation that followed the Telecommunications Act of 1996  In 2005  Disney CEO Bob Iger sought to sell the ABC Radio division  having declared it a  non core asset   On February 6  2006  Disney announced that all ABC Radio properties  excluding Radio Disney and ESPN Radio  would be spun off and merged with Citadel Broadcasting Corporation  In March 2007 the Federal Communications Commission approved the transfer of ABC s 24 radio station licenses to Citadel  the  2 6 billion merger closed on June 12  2007  ABC News   a unit of the ABC Television Network   continues to produce ABC News Radio  which Citadel has agreed to distribute for at least ten years  With the sale of ABC Radio  ABC became the second heritage American television network to sell its original radio properties  NBC sold its radio network to Westwood One in 1987  and its stations to various companies through 1988  CBS is now the only broadcast television network with its original radio link  though both Fox News  amp  Fox Sports  through Clear Channel Communications  and CNN  via Westwood One  have a significant radio presence  On March 10  2011  Cumulus Media announced that it would purchase Citadel Broadcasting  After receiving conditional regulatory approval from the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission  the deal was approved by Citadel shareholders on September 15  2011  The merger of the two companies closed on September 16  2011  and Citadel became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Cumulus Media   edit  ABC s library Today  ABC owns nearly all its in house television and theatrical productions made from the 1970s forward  with the exception of certain co

the American Broadcasting Company For most of the network s existence  in regards to children s programming  ABC has aired mostly programming from Walt Disney Television or other producers  most notably  Hanna Barbera Productions and DIC Entertainment   The crown jewel of its children s programming lineup was the award winning Schoolhouse Rock  which aired beginning in 1973 and was finally retired in 2001  Following ABC s sale to Disney  the network s content produced by its new owners would increase  this also included the animated and or live action children s programming  On September 13  1997  ABC remodeled its Saturday morning children s programming lineup  renaming it Disney s One Saturday Morning  It featured many programs  mostly animated series  from Walt Disney Television  In 2001  ABC began a deal with sister network Disney Channel to air its original programming  Originally  the lineup aired only a couple of Disney Channel series  Lizzie McGuire and Even Stevens  but has since grown to take up the entire lineup which was rebranded as ABC Kids on September 14  2002  By 2010  Power Rangers was the last program on ABC Kids that did not air on Disney Channel  it was removed on August 29  2010  leaving affiliates with this slot  As of summer 2011  the entire ABC Kids lineup had been in reruns for several years  consisting primarily of reruns of shows that had already ended their runs on Disney Channel  no new episodes were added into rotation after approximately 2007  as a result  shows such as Hannah Montana only had a limited number of

offer full length episodes online from May June 2006  Beginning with the 2006 2007 television season  ABC com has regularly begun airing full length episodes of most of its popular and new shows on its website the day after they aired on ABC  with some advertisements  though less than when broadcast for television   This is assumed to be a response to the popularity of digital recording devices and piracy issues that major network broadcasters are facing  In April 2007 the full episode player began offering full screen viewing  as well as a small  mini  screen that users can position wherever they choose on their desktops  in addition to the two original standard viewing size viewing options  In July 2007  ABC com began presenting content in HD  Launching initially as a beta test
