officially the Republic of Lebanon nb 1   Arabic                                      al Jumh r yah al Lubn n yah   is a country in the East Mediterranean  It is bordered by Syria to the north and east  and Israel to the south  Lebanon s location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterland has dictated its rich history  and shaped a cultural identity of religious and ethnic diversity  6  The earliest evidence of civilization in Lebanon dates back more than 7 000 years predating recorded history  7  Lebanon was the home of the Phoenicians  a maritime culture that flourished for nearly 2 500 years  3000 539 BC   Following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I  the five provinces that comprise modern Lebanon were mandated to France  The French expanded the borders of Mount Lebanon  which was mostly populated by Maronite Catholics and Druze  to include more Muslims  Lebanon gained independence in 1943  and established a unique political system  known as confessionalism  a power sharing mechanism based on religious communities   Bechara El Khoury who became independent Lebanon s first President and Riad El Solh  who became Lebanon s first prime minister  are considered the founders of the modern Republic of Lebanon and are national heroes for having led the country s independence  French troops withdrew from Lebanon in 1946  8  Before the Lebanese Civil War  1975 1990   the country experienced a period of relative calm and prosperity  driven by tourism  agriculture  and banking  9  Because of its financial power and diversity  Lebanon was known in its heyday as the  Switzerland of the East   10  It attracted large numbers of tourists  11  such that the capital Beirut was referred to as  Paris of the Middle East   At the end of the war  there were extensive efforts to revive the economy and rebuild national infrastructure  12  Until July 2006  Lebanon enjoyed considerable stability  Beirut s reconstruction was almost complete  13  and increasing numbers of tourists poured into the nation s resorts  11  Then  the month long 2006 war between Israel and Lebanon caused significant civilian death and heavy damage to Lebanon s civil infrastructure  Due to its tightly regulated financial system and the highest gold reserve in the Middle East  Lebanese banks largely avoided the financial crisis of 2007 2010  In 2009  despite a global recession  Lebanon enjoyed 9  economic growth and hosted the largest number of tourists in its history  however  by 2011  economic growth had slowed to below average for the region  14  Lebanon is known for its unique efforts in the Middle East to guarantee civil rights and freedom to its citizens  ranking first in the Middle East and 26th worldwide  out of 66

around 47 BC  Julius Caesar proclaimed  Lub   Na an   meaning  White Land  in Semitic  16  Occurrences of the name have been found in texts from the library of Ebla  17  which date to the third millennium BC  nearly 70 times in the Hebrew Bible  and three of the twelve tablets of the Epic of Gilgamesh  perhaps as early as 2100 BC   18  The name is recorded in Ancient Egyptian as Rmnn  where R stood for Canaanite L  19   edit  Geography Main article  Geography of Lebanon Lebanon from space  Snow cover can be seen on the western and eastern mountain ranges Lebanon is located in Western Asia between latitudes 33  and 35  N  and longitudes 35  and 37  E  The country s surface area is 10 452 square kilometres  4 036 sq mi  of which 10 230 square kilometres  3 950 sq mi  is land  Lebanon has a coastline and border of 225 kilometres  140 mi  on the Mediterranean sea to the west  a 375 kilometres  233 mi  border shared with Syria to the north and east and a 79 kilometres  49 mi  long border with Israel to the south  20  The border with the Israeli occupied Golan Heights is disputed by Lebanon in a small area called Shebaa Farms  21  Lebanon is divided into four distinct physiographic regions  the coastal plain  the Lebanon mountain range  the Beqaa valley and the Anti Lebanon mountains  Mountain scenery in Barouk The narrow and discontinuous coastal plain stretches from the Syrian border in the north where it widens to form the Akkar plain to Ras al Naqoura at the border with Israel in the south  The fertile coastal plain is formed of marine sediments and river deposited alluvium alternating with sandy bays and rocky beaches  The Lebanon mountains rise steeply parallel to the Mediterranean coast and form a ridge of limestone and sandstone that runs for most of the country s length  The mountain range varies in width between 10km and 56km  it is carved by narrow and deep gorges  The Lebanon mountains peak at 3 088 metres  10 131 ft  above sea level in Qurnat as Sawda  in North Lebanon and gradually slope to the south before rising again to a height of 2 695 metres  8 842 ft  in Mount Sannine  The Beqaa valley sits between the Lebanon mountains in the west and the Anti Lebanon range in the east  it s a part of the Great Rift Valley system  The valley is 180km long and 10 to 26km wide  its fertile soil is formed by alluvial deposits  The Anti Lebanon range runs parallel to the Lebanon mountains  its highest peak is in Mount Hermon at 2 814 metres  9 232 ft   20  The mountains of Lebanon are drained by seasonal torrents and rivers foremost of which is the 145 kilometres  90 mi  long Leontes that rises in the Beqaa Valley to the west of Baalbek and empties into the Mediterranean Sea north of Tyre  20   edit  Climate Main article  Climate of Lebanon Nahr Ibrahim running through the lush Adonis gorge Lebanon has a moderate Mediterranean climate  In coastal areas  winters are generally cool and rainy whilst summers are hot and humid  In more elevated areas  temperatures usually drop below freezing during the winter with heavy snow cover that remains until early summer on the higher mountaintops  22  20  Although most of Lebanon receives a relatively large amount of rainfall annually  compared to its arid surroundings   certain areas in north eastern Lebanon receive little because of rain shadow created by the high peaks of the western mountain range  23   edit  Environment In ancient times  Lebanon was covered by large forests of Cedar  the national emblem of the country  24  As a result of longstanding exploitation  few old Cedar trees remain in pockets of forests in Lebanon  but there is an active program to conserve and regenerate the forests  The Lebanese approach has emphasized natural regeneration over planting  and this by creating the right conditions for germination and growth  The Lebanese state has created several nature reserves that contain cedars  including the Shouf Biosphere Reserve  the Jaj Cedar Reserve  the Tannourine Reserve  the Ammouaa and Karm Shbat Reserves in the Akkar district  and the Forest of the Cedars of God near Bsharri  25  26  27  In 2010  the Environment Ministry set a 10 year plan to increase the national forest coverage by 20  that is equivalent to the planting of two million new trees each year  28  The plan  which was funded the U S  development agency  USAID  and overseen by the U S  Forest Service  and the Lebanon Reforestation Initiative  was inaugurated in 2011 by planting of seedlings  such as cedar  pine  wild almond  juniper  fir and oak  in five regions around Lebanon  28  The forests cover 13 4  of the Lebanese land area  29  they are under constant threat from wildfires caused by the long dry summer season  30   edit  History Main article  History of Lebanon  edit  Ancient history Main article  History of ancient Lebanon Map of Phoenicia and trade routes Evidence of an early settlement in Lebanon was found in Byblos  which is considered to be one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world  7  and date back to earlier than 5000 BC  Archaeologists discovered remnants of prehistoric huts with crushed limestone floors  primitive weapons  and burial jars left by the Neolithic and Chalcolithic fishing communities who lived on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea over 7 000 years ago  31  Lebanon was the homeland of the Phoenicians  a seafaring people that spread across the Mediterranean before the rise of Cyrus the Great  32  After two centuries of Persian rule  Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great attacked and burned Tyre  the most prominent Phoenician city  Throughout the subsequent centuries leading up to recent times  the country became part of numerous succeeding empires  among them Egyptian Empire  Persian  Assyrian  Hellenistic  Roman  Eastern Roman  Arab  Seljuk  Mamluk  Crusader  and the Ottoman Empire   edit  Ottoman Era In 1590  Fakhr al Din II became successor to Korkmaz  He was a skilled politician and described as a pupil of Machiavelli  Fakhr al Din II adjusted to the lifestyles of the Druze  Christianity and Islam  according to his needs  He paid tribute to the Sultanate of the Ottoman Empire and shared the spoils of war with his masters  Eventually  Fakhr al Din II was appointed Sultan of Mt  Lebanon  with full authority  He was considered one of the greatest rulers of the region  also across the Middle of Lebanon  But  his enemies and governors angered the Ottoman Sultanate  Hence  a campaign  calling for the arrest of Fakhr al Din II  found the deposed leader in Istanbul  where he was executed by hanging  33  Shortly afterwards  the Emirate of Mt  Lebanon that lasted more than 500 years was replaced  instead of the emirate meteor   edit  French mandate and

September 1926  France formed the Lebanese Republic  A constitution was adopted on 25 May 1926 establishing a democratic republic with a parliamentary system of government  Lebanon gained independence in 1943  while France was occupied by Germany  36  General Henri Dentz  the Vichy High Commissioner for Syria and Lebanon  played a major role in the independence of the nation  The Vichy authorities in 1941 allowed Germany to move aircraft and supplies through Syria to Iraq where they were used against British forces  The United Kingdom  fearing that Nazi Germany would gain full control of Lebanon and Syria by pressure on the weak Vichy government  sent its army into Syria and Lebanon  After the fighting ended in Lebanon  General Charles de Gaulle visited the area  Under political pressure from both inside and outside Lebanon  de Gaulle recognized the independence of Lebanon  On 26 November 1941 General Georges Catroux announced that Lebanon would become independent under the authority of the Free French government  Elections were held in 1943 and on 8 November 1943 the new Lebanese government unilaterally abolished the mandate  The French reacted by throwing the new government into prison  In the face of international pressure  the French released the government officials on 22 November 1943 and recognized the independence of Lebanon  The allies kept the region under control until the end of World War II  The last French troops withdrew in 1946  Lebanon s unwritten National Pact of 1943 required that its president be Maronite Christian  its speaker of the parliament to be a Shiite Muslim  its prime minister be Sunni Muslim  and the deputy speaker of Parliament and the deputy prime minister be Greek Orthodox  37  Lebanon s history since independence has been marked by alternating periods of political stability and turmoil  including a civil conflict in 1958  interspersed with prosperity built on Beirut s position as a regional center for finance and trade  38   edit  1948 Arab Israeli war Main article  1948 Arab Israeli war In May 1948  Lebanon supported neighbouring Arab countries against Israel  While some irregular forces crossed the border

Minister Ehud Barak  to withdraw because of continuous attacks executed by Hezbollah  and a belief that the violence would diminish and dissolve without the Israeli presence in Lebanon  50  The UN determined that the withdrawal of Israeli troops beyond the blue line was in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 425  although a border region called the Shebaa Farms is still disputed  Hezbollah declared that it would not stop its operations against Israel until this area was liberated  51   edit  Cedar Revolution Main article  Cedar Revolution Part of Rue Minet al Hosn  where Rafik Hariri was assassinated on 14 February 2005 On 14 February 2005  former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was assassinated in a car bomb explosion near the Saint George Hotel in Beirut  52  Leaders of the March 14 Alliance  a pro Western coalition  accused Syria of the attack 53  because of its extensive military and intelligence presence in Lebanon  and the public rift between Hariri and Damascus over the Syrian backed constitutional amendment extending President Lahoud s term in office  Others  namely the March 8 Alliance and Syrian officials  claimed that the assassination may have been executed by the Israeli Mossad in an attempt to destabilize the country  54  This incident triggered a series of demonstrations  dubbed the  Cedar Revolution   which demanded the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon and the establishment of an international commission to investigate the assassination  The United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1559 on 7 April 2005  which called for an investigation into the assassination of Rafik Hariri  55  Preliminary findings of the investigation were officially published on 20 October 2005 in the Mehlis report  which cited indications that high ranking members of the Syrian and Lebanese governments were involved in the assassination  56  Eventually  and under pressure from the West  Syria began withdrawing its 15 000 strong army troops from Lebanon  57  By 26 April 2005  all uniformed Syrian soldiers had already crossed the border back to Syria  58  The Hariri assassination marked the beginning of a series of

three Israeli soldiers and captured a further two  64  Hezbollah claims that the objectives of the operation were to free Lebanese prisoners held in Israel  Israel responded with airstrikes and a ground incursion into Lebanon aimed at halting Hezbollah s rocket fire  reducing Hezbollah s military capacity and rescuing the two abducted Israeli soldiers  The 34 day campaign caused wide spread damage to Lebanon s infrastructure  including Beirut s airport   Beirut s southern suburb was heavily damaged by Israeli airstrikes where Hezbollah military infrastructure was deeply embedded among the civilian population  65  The month long conflict caused significant loss of life  some 1 191 Lebanese 66  and 160 Israelis 67  were killed in the conflict  While figures are vastly debated

to accommodate the Palestinian refugees suffering from the difficult winter conditions in the Beqaa Valley and the suburbs of Tripoli  The Lebanese Army is banned from entering all Palestinian camps under the 1969 Cairo Agreement  Late in the night of Saturday 19 May 2007  a building was surrounded by Lebanese Internal Security Forces  ISF  in which a group of Fatah al Islam militants accused of taking part in a bank robbery earlier that day were hiding  The ISF attacked the building early on Sunday 20 May 2007  unleashing a day long battle between the ISF and Fatah al Islam militants  As a response  members of Fatah al Islam in Nahr al Bared Camp attacked an army checkpoint  killing several soldiers in their sleep  The army immediately responded by shelling the camp and launching rockets bringing down specific buildings  The camp became the center of the fighting between the Lebanese Army and Fatah al Islam  It sustained heavy shelling while under siege  UNRWA estimates the battle between the army and Islamic militant group Fatah al Islam destroyed or rendered uninhabitable as much as 85  of homes in the camp and ruined infrastructure  The camp s up to 40 000 residents were forced to flee  many of them sheltering in the already overcrowded Beddawi camp  10 km to the south  At least 169 soldiers  287 insurgents and 47 civilians were killed in the army s battle with

Lebanese abroad to family members within the country total  8 2 billion 96  and account for one fifth of the country s economy  97  Lebanon has the largest proportion of skilled labor among Arab States  98  Although Lebanon is ideally suited for agricultural activities in terms of water availability and soil fertility  as it possesses the highest proportion of cultivable land in the Arabic speaking world  99  it does not have a large agricultural sector  Attracting only 12  of the total workforce  100  agriculture is the least popular economic sector in Lebanon  It contributes approximately 11 7  of the country s GDP  also placing it in the lowest rank compared to other economic sectors  Major produce includes apples  peaches  oranges  and lemons  9  Industry in Lebanon is mainly limited to small businesses that reassemble and package imported parts  In 2004  industry ranked second in workforce  with 26  of the Lebanese working population  100  and second in GDP contribution  with 21  of Lebanon s GDP  9  Add caption here A combination of beautiful climate  many historic landmarks and World Heritage Sites continues to attract large numbers of tourists to Lebanon  In addition  Lebanon s strict financial secrecy and capitalist economy have given it significant  though no longer dominant  economic status among Arab countries  The thriving tourism and banking activities have naturally made the services sector the most important pillar of the Lebanese economy  The majority of the Lebanese workforce  nearly 65   100  attains employment in the services sector as a result of the abundant job opportunities  The GDP contribution  accordingly  amounts to roughly 67 3  of the annual Lebanese GDP  9  However  dependence on the tourism and banking sectors leaves the economy vulnerable to political instability  101  The 1975 1990 civil war heavily damaged Lebanon s economic infrastructure  cut national output by half  and all but ended Lebanon s position as a West Asian entrep t and banking hub  5  The subsequent period of relative peace enabled the central government to restore control in Beirut  begin collecting taxes  and regain access to key port and government facilities  Economic recovery has been helped by a financially sound banking system and resilient small  and medium scale manufacturers  with family remittances  banking services  manufactured and farm exports  and international aid as the main sources of foreign exchange  102  Until the 2006 Lebanon War  Lebanon s economy witnessed excellent growth  with bank assets reaching over 75 billion US dollars  103  By the end of the first half of 2006  the influx of tourists to Lebanon had already registered a 49 3  increase over 2005 figures  which was a low figure  making the 49 3  increase seem more spectacular than it was   103 Market capitalization was also at an all time high  estimated at  10 9 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2006  just weeks before the fighting started  103  The war severely damaged Lebanon s fragile economy  especially the tourism sector  According to a preliminary report published by the Lebanese Ministry of Finance on 30 August 2006  a major economic decline was expected as a result of the fighting  104  Rafiq Hariri International Airport re opened in September 2006  and the efforts to revive the Lebanese economy have proceeded at a slow pace  Major contributors to the reconstruction of Lebanon include Saudi Arabia  with US  1 5 billion pledged   105  the European Union  with about  1 billion  106  and a few other Persian Gulf countries with contributions of up to  800 million  107  According to the CIA World Factbook  Lebanon s 2010 public debt exceeded 150 7  of GDP  ranking fourth highest in the world as a percentage of GDP  though down from 154 8  in 2009  5  Finance minister Mohammad Chatah stated that the debt reached  47 billion in 2008 and would increase to  49 billion if privatization of two telecoms companies did not occur  108  The Daily Star wrote that exorbitant debt levels have  slowed down the economy and reduced the government s spending on essential development projects   109  Given the frequent security turmoil it has faced  the Lebanese banking system has adopted a conservative approach  with strict regulations imposed by the central bank to protect the economy from political instability  These regulations have generally left Lebanese banks unscathed by the Financial crisis of 2007 2010  Lebanese banks remain  under the current circumstances  high on liquidity and reputed for their security  110  Consequently  Lebanon is one of the only seven countries in the world in which the value of the stock markets increased in 2008  111  Moreover  in 2009  Lebanon hosted the largest number of tourists to date  eclipsing the previous record set before the Lebanese Civil War  112  The Lebanese economy grew 8 5  in 2008 and a revised 9  in 2009 113  despite a

updated outlook on the Lebanese economy  predicting real gross domestic produce  GDP  growth would reach 6 8  in 2010 and 5 8  in 2011  115  Oil has recently been discovered inland and in the seabed between Lebanon  Cyprus  Israel and Egypt and talks are underway between Cyprus and Egypt to reach an agreement regarding the exploration of these resources The seabed separating Lebanon and Cyprus is believed to hold significant quantities of crude oil and natural gas  116  To boost the economy and increase foreign direct investments  the Lebanese government has established a national investment promotion agency  IDAL  the Investment Development Authority of Lebanon in 1994  It was established with the aim of promoting Lebanon as a key investment destination  and attracting facilitating  and retaining investments in the country  In 2001  Investment Law No 360 117  was enacted to reinforce the organisation s mission  providing a framework for regulating investment activities in Lebanon  and providing local and foreign investors alike with a range of incentives and business support services  In addition to its role as an investment promotion agency  IDAL was entrusted with the active promotion and marketing of Lebanese exports including but not limited to agricultural and agro industrial products  IDAL enjoys financial and administrative autonomy and reports to the President of the Council of Ministers who exercises a tutorial authority over it   edit  Tourism Main article  Tourism in Lebanon Baalbek Temple of Jupiter Sunset in Raouche Between 2005 and 2007  Lebanon was in a state of political turmoil  resulting in a sharp fall in tourism  Over the course of 2008 Lebanon rebuilt its infrastructure mainly in the real estate and tourism sectors resulting in a comparatively robust post war economy  In 2009  the New York Times ranked Beirut the No  1 travel destination worldwide due to its Unique Nightlife and Hospitality  118  In January 2010  the Ministry of Tourism announced that 1 851 081 tourists had visited Lebanon in 2009  a 39  increase from 2008  119  Overall  Lebanon has seen an annual increase in tourism since 2006  119  Recently  after the long years of the civil war and reoccurring periods of political unrest in Lebanon  Lebanon has become an increasingly popular destination for tourism  Its rich history  historic sites  mild climate  along with other factors  have all made Lebanon currently one of the most visited countries in the Middle East  Lebanon  even in its post war state  has managed to attract around 1 333 000 tourists in 2008  thus placing it as rank 79 out of 191 participating countries  120  Statistics have shown that Lebanon s tourist attraction rate has been increasing rapidly and the Ministry of Tourism predicts that this ongoing trend will amplify in the coming years  Saudi Arabia and Jordan are the two most popular origin countries of foreign tourists to Lebanon  121   edit  Education Main article  Education in Lebanon  edit  Schools All Lebanese schools are required to follow a prescribed curriculum designed by the Ministry of Education  Some of the 1400 private schools offer IB programs  122  and may also add more courses to their curriculum with approval from the Ministry of Education  The main subjects taught are mathematics  sciences  Arabic  and at least one secondary language  either French or English   The government introduces a mild form of selectivity into the curriculum by giving 11th graders choice between two  concentrations   sciences  humanities  and 12th graders choose between four concentrations  life sciences  general sciences  sociology and economics  and humanities and literature  The choices in concentration do not include major changes in the number of subjects taken  if at all   However  subjects that fall out of the concentration are given less weight in grading and are less rigorous  while subjects that fall within the concentration are more challenging and contribute significantly to the final grade  Students go through three academic phases  Name Number of years Annotations Elementary 6 Intermediate 3 students earn Intermediate Certification  Lebanese Brevet  at completion Secondary 3 students who pass official exams earn a Baccalaureate Certificate  Baccalaur at Libanais  in the concentration they chose in 12th grade  Students studying at French system schools or American system schools may also graduate with a French Baccalaureate that is considered equivalent to the Lebanese Baccalaureate  Students can also graduate with an International Baccalaureate  current in some of the private schools   The first eight years are  by law  compulsory  9  Nevertheless  this requirement currently falls short of being fully enforced   edit  Higher education Following secondary school  Lebanese students may choose to study at a university  a college  or a vocational training institute  The number of years to complete each program varies  While the Lebanese educational system offers a very high quality and international class of education  the local employment market lacks sufficient opportunities  thus encouraging many of the young educated to travel abroad  Lebanon has forty one nationally accredited universities  several of which are internationally recognized  123  124  The American University of Beirut  AUB  and the Universit  Saint Joseph  USJ  were the first Anglophone and the first Francophone universities to open in Lebanon  respectively  125  126  Another prestigious and internationally recognized university is the Lebanese American University citation needed   Universities in Lebanon  both public and private  largely operate in French or English  127  The American University of Beirut is one of the highest ranked and oldest universities in the Middle East  In 1862 American missionaries in Lebanon and Syria  under the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions  asked Dr  Daniel Bliss to establish a college of higher learning that would include medical training  On 24 April 1863  while Dr  Daniel Bliss was raising money for the new college in the United States and England  the State of New York granted a charter for the Syrian Protestant College  The college  which was renamed the American University of Beirut in 1920  opened with a class of 16 students on 3 December 1866  Dr  Bliss served as its first president  from 1866 until 1902  The American University of Beirut  AUB  has been accredited as an institution since 2004 by the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools  3624 Market Street  Philadelphia  PA 19104  Tel  267 284 5000   AUB s accreditation was most recently reaffirmed in June 2009  after the completion of an extensive self study that was reviewed by educational experts chosen in consultation with Middle States  The University s next full accreditation cycle is due in 2018 19  Over the last several years  a number of University programs and faculties have also sought accreditation with more specialized bodies  The Faculty of Health Sciences  Graduate Public Health program became the first such program to be accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health  CEPH  outside of North America  Similarly  the Rafic Hariri School of Nursing became the first nursing school beyond American territories to have BSN and MSN programs accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education  CCNE   In April 2009  undergraduate and graduate programs at the Suliman S  Olayan School of Business were accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business  AACSB   Most recently  in July 2010  four undergraduate Engineering programs at AUB s Faculty of Engineering and Architecture were accredited by ABET Inc   Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology   In general  the accreditation process is intended to strengthen and sustain the quality and integrity of a university  faculty  or program  confirming that it is worthy of public confidence  AUB has been registered with and recognized by the New York State Education Department  NYSED  since 1863  Its degrees are recognized by the Lebanese government through the equivalence committees of the Ministry of Education and Higher Education  At the English universities  students who have graduated from an American style high school program enter at the freshman level to earn their baccalaureate equivalence from the Lebanese Ministry of Higher Education  This qualifies them to continue studying at the higher levels  Such students are required to have already taken the SAT I and the SAT II upon applying to college  in lieu of the official exams  On the other hand  students who have graduated from a school that follows the Lebanese educational system are directly admitted to the sophomore year  These students are still required to take the SAT I  but not the SAT II  The university academic degrees for the first stage are the Bachelor or the Licence  for the second stage are the Master or the DEA and the third stage is the doctorate  The United Nations assigned Lebanon an education index of 0 871 in
