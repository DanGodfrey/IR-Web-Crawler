Kingdom of Denmark  located between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans  east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago  Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America  Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe  specifically Norway and later Denmark  for more than a millennium  Greenland is  by area  the world s largest island that is not a continent  7  With a population of 56 615  January 2011 estimate  it is the least densely populated dependency or country in the world  8  Greenland has been inhabited  though not continuously  by Arctic peoples via Canada for 4500 5000 years  9  10  In the 10th century  Norsemen settled on the uninhabited southern part of Greenland  In the 13th century  the Inuit arrived  and in the late 15th century the Norse colonies were abandoned  In the early 18th century contact between Scandinavia and Greenland was re established and Denmark established rule over Greenland  Greenland became a Danish colony  called Gr nland  in 1814 after being under the rule of Denmark Norway for centuries  With the Constitution of Denmark of 1953  Greenland became a part of the Danish Realm in a relationship known in Danish as Rigsf llesskabet  Commonwealth of the Realm   In 1979 Denmark granted home rule to Greenland  and in 2008 Greenland voted to transfer more power from the Danish royal government to the local Greenlandic government  This became effective the following year  with the Danish royal government in charge of foreign affairs  security  defence police justice   and financial policy  and providing a subsidy of DKK 3 4 billion  or approximately  11 300 per Greenlander  annually  Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 2 1 Early Paleo Eskimo cultures 2 2 Norse settlement 2 3 1500 1814 2 4 Treaty of Kiel

Scandinavian settlers  In the Icelandic sagas  it is said that Norwegian born Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder  He  along with his extended family and thralls  set out in ships to find a land rumoured to lie to the northwest  After settling there  he named the land Gr nland   Greenland    supposedly in the hope that the pleasant name would attract settlers  11  12  13   edit  History Main article  History of Greenland  edit  Early Paleo Eskimo cultures In prehistoric times Greenland was home to several successive Paleo Eskimo cultures known primarily through archaeological findings  The earliest entry of the Paleo Eskimo into Greenland is thought to have occurred about 2500 BC  From around 2500 BC to 800 BC  southern and western Greenland was inhabited by the Saqqaq culture  Most findings of Saqqaq period archaeological remains have been around Disko Bay  From 2400 BC to 1300 BC the Independence I culture existed in northern Greenland  It was a part of the Arctic small tool tradition  Around 800 BC  the Saqqaq culture disappeared and the Early Dorset culture emerged in western Greenland and the Independence II culture in northern Greenland  The Dorset culture was the first culture to extend throughout the Greenlandic coastal areas  both on the west and east coasts  and it lasted until the arrival of the Thule culture in 1500 AD  The Dorset culture population lived primarily from whale hunting  The Thule culture people are the ancestors of the current Greenlandic population  They started migrating from Alaska around 1000 AD  reaching Greenland around 1300 AD  The Thule culture was the first to introduce to Greenland such technological innovations as dog sleds and toggling harpoons   edit  Norse settlement From 986 AD  Greenland s west coast was colonised by Icelanders and Norwegians in two settlements on fjords near the southwestern most tip of the island  14  They shared the island with the late Dorset culture inhabitants who occupied the northern and western parts  and later with the Thule culture arriving from the north  Norse Greenlanders submitted to Norwegian rule in the 13th century  and the kingdom of Norway entered into a personal union with Denmark in 1380 and from 1397 was a part of the Kalmar Union  15  The settlements  such as Brattahl    thrived for centuries but disappeared some time in the 15th century  perhaps at the onset of the Little Ice Age  16  Interpretation of ice core and clam shell data suggests that between 800 and 1300 AD the regions around the fjords of southern Greenland experienced a relatively mild climate several degrees Celsius higher than usual in the North Atlantic  17  with trees and herbaceous plants growing and livestock being farmed  Barley was grown as a crop up to the 70th parallel  18  What is verifiable is that the ice cores indicate Greenland has experienced dramatic temperature shifts many times over the past 100 000 years  19  Similarly the Icelandic Book of Settlements records famines during the winters in which  the old and helpless were killed and thrown over cliffs    Arnold 2010  The last written records of the Norse Greenlanders are of a marriage in 1408 in the church of Hvalsey today the best preserved Nordic ruins in Greenland  These Icelandic settlements vanished during the 14th and 15th centuries  probably as a result of famine and increasing conflicts with the Inuit  20  The condition of human bones from this period indicates that the Norse population was malnourished  probably due to soil erosion resulting from the Norsemen s destruction of natural vegetation in the course of farming  turf cutting  and wood cutting  pandemic plague  a decline in temperatures during the Little Ice Age  and or armed conflicts with the Inuit  16  Jared Diamond suggests that cultural practices  such as rejecting fish as a source of food and relying solely on livestock ill adapted to Greenland s  deteriorating  climate  resulted in recurring famine which led to abandonment of the colony  16  However  isotope analysis of the bones of inhabitants shows that marine food sources supplied more and more of the diet of the Norse Greenlanders  making up between 50  and 80  of their diet by the 14th century  21   edit  1500 1814 In 1500  King Manuel I of Portugal sent Gaspar Corte Real to Greenland in search of a Northwest Passage to Asia which  according to the Treaty of Tordesillas  was part of the Portuguese area of influence  In 1501 Corte Real returned with his brother  Miguel Corte Real  Finding the sea frozen  they headed south and arrived in Labrador and Newfoundland  Upon their return to Portugal the cartographic information supplied by Corte Real was incorporated into a new map of the world which was presented to the Ercole I d Este  Duke of Ferrara by Alberto Cantino in 1502  The Cantino planisphere  made in Lisbon  accurately depicts the southern coastline of Greenland  22  King Christian IV s Expeditions to Greenland was a series of expeditions in the years 1605 1607 to Greenland and Arctic waterways in order to locate the lost Eastern Norse Settlement and assert Danish sovereignty over Greenland  The expeditions were mostly unsuccessful  partly due to leaders lacking experience with the difficult arctic ice and weather conditions  and partly because the expedition leaders were given instructions to search for the Eastern Settlement on the east coast of Greenland just north of Cape Farewell  which is almost inaccessible due to southward drifting ice  The pilot on all three trips was English explorer James Hall  After the Norse settlements died off the area came under the de facto control of various Inuit groups  but the Danish government never forgot or relinquished the claims to Greenland that it had inherited from the Norwegians  and when contact with Greenland was re established in the early 18th century  Denmark asserted its sovereignty over the island  In 1721 a joint mercantile and clerical expedition led by Danish Norwegian missionary Hans Egede was sent to Greenland  not knowing whether a Norse civilisation remained there  The expedition can be seen as part of the Danish colonisation of the Americas  After 15 years in Greenland  Hans Egede left his son Paul Egede in charge of the mission in Greenland and returned to Denmark where he established a Greenland Seminary  This new colony was centred at Godth b   Good Hope   on the southwest coast  Gradually  Greenland was opened up to Danish merchants  and closed to those from other countries   edit  Treaty of Kiel to World War II Eventually  when the union between Denmark and Norway was dissolved in 1814  Treaty of Kiel   the originally officially Norwegian dependencies of Greenland  Iceland and the Faroe Islands became part of the reorganised  Kingdom of Denmark   Norway occupied and claimed parts of the then uninhabited eastern Greenland  also called Erik the Red s Land  in July 1931  claiming that it constituted terra nullius  Norway and Denmark agreed to submit the matter in 1933 to the Permanent Court of International Justice  which decided against Norway  23  Greenland s connection to Denmark was severed on 9 April 1940  early in World War II  when Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany  On April 8  1941  the United States occupied Greenland in order to defend it against a possible invasion by Germany  24  The United States occupation of Greenland continued until 1945  Greenland was able to buy goods from the United States and Canada by selling cryolite from the mine at Ivittuut  During this war  the system of government changed  Governor Eske Brun ruled the island under a law of 1925 that allowed governors to take control under extreme circumstances  Governor Aksel Svane was transferred to the US to lead the commission to supply Greenland  A sledge patrol  in 1942  named the Sirius Patrol   guarding the northeastern shores of Greenland using dog sleds  detected several German weather stations and alerted American troops who then destroyed them  After the collapse of the Third Reich  Albert Speer briefly considered escaping in a small aeroplane to hide out in Greenland  but changed his mind and decided to turn himself in to the United States Armed Forces  25  Greenland had been a protected and very isolated society until 1940  The Danish government  which governed Greenland as its colony  had been convinced that this society would face exploitation from the outside world or even extinction if the country were opened up  Therefore  it maintained a strict monopoly of Greenlandic trade  allowing only small scale troaking with Scottish whalers  Nevertheless  wartime Greenland developed a sense of self reliance through self government and independent communication with the outside world  Despite this change  in 1946 a commission  with the highest Greenlandic council  the Landsr dene  as a participant  recommended patience and no radical reform of the system  Two years later  the first step towards a change of government was initiated when a grand commission was established  A final report  G 50  was presented in 1950  Greenland was to be a modern welfare state with Denmark as sponsor and example  In 1953  Greenland was made an equal part of the Danish Kingdom  Home rule was granted in 1979   edit  Home rule and self rule The orthography and vocabulary of the Greenlandic language is governed by Oqaasileriffik  the Greenlandic language secretariat  located in the Ilimmarfik university Campus in Nuuk  Following World War II  the United States developed a geopolitical interest in Greenland  and in 1946 the United States offered to buy Greenland from Denmark for  100 000 000  but Denmark refused to sell  26  27  However  in 1950 Denmark did agree to allow the United States to establish the Thule Air Base  construction of which was begun in 1951 and completed in 1953  as part of a unified NATO Cold War defense strategy  With the 1953 Danish constitution Greenland s colonial status ended as the island was incorporated into the Danish realm as an amt  county   also extending Danish citizenship to Greenlanders  This also resulted in a change in Danish policies towards Greenland which now came to consist in a strategy of cultural assimilation  or de Greenlandification  During this period the Danish government promoted the exclusive use of Danish in official matters  and required Greenlanders to go to Denmark for their post secondary education  many Greenlandic children grew up on boarding schools in southern Denmark  many losing their cultural ties to Greenland  While the policies  succeeded  in the sense of creating a demographic shift turning Greenlanders from being primarily subsistence hunters into being urbanized wage earners  the policy also backfired to produce a reassertion of Greenlandic cultural identity by the Greenlandic elite  leading to a movement in favor of independence that reached its peak in the 1970s  28  As a consequence of political complications in relation to Denmark s entry into the European Common Market in 1972  a further desire to establish the legality of Greenland s status formed in Denmark  resulting in the Home Rule Act of 1979  which gave Greenland limited autonomy with its own national assembly taking control of some internal policies  while the Parliament of Denmark maintained full control with external policies  security  and natural resources  The law came into effect on 1 May 1979  The Queen of Denmark  Margrethe II  remains Greenland s Head of State  In 1985  Greenland left the European Economic Community  EEC  upon achieving self rule  in view of the EEC s commercial fishing regulations and an EEC ban on seal skin products  29  A referendum on greater autonomy 30  was approved on 25 November 2008  31  On 21 June 2009  Greenland assumed self determination with responsibility for self government of judicial affairs  policing  and natural resources  Also  Greenlanders were recognised as a separate people under international law  32  Denmark maintains control of foreign affairs and defence matters  Denmark upholds the annual block grant of 3 2 billion Danish kroner  but as Greenland begins to collect revenues of its natural resources the grant will gradually be diminished  It is a step toward full independence from Danish rule  Greenlandic became the sole official language of Greenland at the historic ceremony  1  5  33  34  35  36   edit  Politics Main article  Politics of Greenland Kuupik Kleist  Prime Minister of

the leader of the majority party in Parliament  The current Prime Minister is Kuupik Kleist  As part of the realm of the Kingdom of Denmark  Greenlanders elect two representatives who sit in the Parliament of Denmark  In 1985  Greenland left the European Economic Community  EEC   unlike Denmark  which remains a member  The EEC later became the European Union  EU  it was renamed and expanded in scope in 1992   Greenland retains some ties with the EU via Denmark  However  EU law largely does not apply to Greenland except in the area of trade   edit  Economics and business About half of public spending on Greenland is funded by block grants from Denmark which in 2007 totalled over 3 2 billion kr  Additional proceeds from the sale of fishing licences and the annual compensation from the EU represents 280 million DKK per year  Greenland s economy is based on a narrow professional basis with the fishing industry as the dominant sector with some 90  of its exports  In a few years  quarrying and tourism could complement the fisheries that depend on the changing prices of fish and fishing opportunities  The long range divides the domestic market into many small units that have high operating costs  Most of the fish factories are owned by Royal Greenland   edit  Geography and climate Main article  Geography of Greenland See also  Administrative divisions of Greenland

island and the largest dependent territory by area in the world  However  since the 1950s  scientists have postulated that the ice sheet covering the country may actually conceal three separate island land masses that have been bridged by glaciers over the last geologic cooling period  38  39  40  The average clarification needed  annual temperatures of Nuuk  Greenland vary from  9 to 7  C  16 to 45  F  Southeast coast of Greenland  The total area of Greenland is 2 166 086 km2  836 330 sq mi   including other offshore minor islands   of which the Greenland ice sheet covers 1 755 637 km2  677 855 sq mi   81   and has a volume of approximately 2 850 000 km3  680 000 cu mi   41  The highest point on Greenland is Gunnbj rn Fjeld at 3 700 m  12 139 ft   The majority of Greenland  however  is less than 1 500 m  4 921 ft  in elevation  The weight of the massive Greenland ice sheet has depressed the central land area to form a basin lying more than 300 m  984 ft  below sea level  42  43  The ice flows generally to the coast from the centre of the island  All towns and settlements of Greenland are situated along the ice free coast  with the population being concentrated along the west coast  The northeastern part of Greenland is not part of any municipality  but is the site of the world s largest national park  Northeast Greenland National Park  View of mountains on Greenland from

until 1950  the northernmost permanent outpost in the world  Southern Greenland scenery  near Nanortalik  where fjords and mountains dominate the landscape  The extreme north of Greenland  Peary Land  is not covered by an ice sheet  because the air there is too dry to produce snow  which is essential in the production and maintenance of an ice sheet  If the Greenland ice sheet were to melt away completely  the world s sea level would rise by more than 7 m  23 ft   44  Scoresby Sund in eastern Greenland  the longest fjord in the world  Between 1989 and 1993  U S  and European climate researchers drilled into the summit of Greenland s ice sheet  obtaining a pair of 3 km  1 9 mi  long ice cores  Analysis of the layering and chemical composition of the cores has provided a revolutionary new record of climate change in the Northern Hemisphere going back about 100 000 years  and illustrated that the world s weather and temperature have often shifted rapidly from one seemingly stable state to another  with worldwide consequences  45  The glaciers of Greenland are also contributing to a rise in the global sea level at a faster rate than was previously believed  46  Between 1991 and 2004  monitoring of the weather at one location  Swiss Camp  showed that the average winter temperature had risen almost 6  C  11  F   47  Other research has shown that higher snowfalls from the North Atlantic oscillation caused the interior of the ice cap to thicken by an average of 6 cm or 2 36 in yr between 1994 and 2005  48  However  a recent study suggests a much warmer planet in relatively recent geological times  Scientists who probed 2 km  1 2 mi  through a Greenland glacier to recover the oldest plant DNA on record said that the planet was far warmer hundreds of thousands of years ago than is generally believed  DNA of trees  plants and insects including butterflies and spiders from beneath the southern Greenland glacier was estimated to date to 450 000 to 900 000 years ago  according to the remnants retrieved from this long vanished boreal forest  That view contrasts sharply with the prevailing one that a lush forest of this kind could not have existed in Greenland any later than 2 4 million years ago  These DNA samples suggest that the temperature probably reached 10  C  50  F  in the summer and  17  C  1 4  F  in the winter  They also indicate that during the last interglacial period  130 000 116 000 years ago  when temperatures were on average 5  C  9  F  higher than now  the glaciers on Greenland did not completely melt away  49  Greenland bedrock In 1996  the American Top of the World expedition found the world s northernmost island off Greenland  ATOW1996  An even more northerly candidate was spotted during the return from the expedition  but its status is yet to be confirmed  In 2007  the existence of a new island was announced  Named  Uunartoq Qeqertaq   English  Warming Island   this island has always been present off the coast of Greenland  but was covered by a glacier  This glacier was discovered in 2002 to be shrinking rapidly  and by 2007 had completely melted away  leaving the exposed island  50  The island was named Place of the Year by the Oxford Atlas of the World in 2007  51  Ben Keene  the atlas s editor  commented   In the last two or three decades  global warming has reduced the size of glaciers throughout the Arctic and earlier this year  news sources confirmed what climate scientists already knew  water  not rock  lay beneath this ice bridge on the east coast of Greenland  More islets are likely to appear as the sheet of frozen water covering the world s largest island continues to melt   Some controversy surrounds the history of the island  specifically over whether the island might have been revealed during a brief warm period in Greenland during the mid 20th century  52   edit  Topography About 81  of Greenland s surface is covered by the Greenland ice sheet  The weight of the ice has depressed the central land area into a basin shape  whose base lies more than 300 m  984 ft  below the surrounding ocean  43  Elevations rise suddenly and steeply near the coast

include uranium  aluminium  nickel  platinum  tungsten  titanium and copper  The public sector  including publicly owned enterprises and the municipalities  plays a dominant role in Greenland s economy  About half the government revenues come from grants from the Danish government  an important supplement to the gross domestic product  GDP   Gross domestic product per capita is equivalent to that of the average economies of Europe  Greenland suffered an economic contraction in the early 1990s  but since 1993 the economy has improved  The Greenland Home Rule Government  GHRG  has pursued a tight fiscal policy since the late 1980s which has helped create surpluses in the public budget and low inflation  Since 1990  Greenland has registered a foreign trade deficit following the closure of the last remaining lead and zinc mine that year  More recently  new sources of ruby in Greenland have been discovered promising to bring new industry and a new export to the country   See Gemstone

exists both within Greenland and between the island and other nations  There is also scheduled boat traffic  but the long distances lead to long travel times and low frequency  There are no roads between cities because the coast has many fjords that would require ferry service to connect a road network  citation needed  Kangerlussuaq Airport on the west coast is the major airport of Greenland and the hub for domestic flights  Intercontinental flights connect mainly to Copenhagen  In May 2007  Air Greenland initiated a seasonal route to and from Baltimore in the United States  54  but on March 10  2008  the route was cancelled because of financial losses  55 Air Iceland began operating a twice weekly Keflav k Ilulissat route in July 2009  56  In addition to these routes there are

speak both languages  Greenlandic became the sole official language in June 2009  62  In practice  Danish is still widely used in the administration  as a language of higher education  but also as the first or only language for parts of the population in Nuuk and larger towns  A debate about the role of Greenlandic and Danish in future society is ongoing  The country has a 100  literacy rate  57   edit  Greenlandic Main article  Greenlandic language A majority of the population speaks Greenlandic  most of them bilingually  but some are monolingual  The Greenlandic language is spoken by about 50 000 people  It is the most populous of the languages of the Eskimo Aleut language family and has as many speakers as all the other languages of the family combined  Within Greenland  three main dialects exist  Western Greenlandic or Kalaallisut  which serves as the official standard language  the northern dialect Inuktun or Avanersuarmiutut  spoken by around 1 000 Inughuit in the region of Qaanaaq  and the eastern dialect Tunumiisut  spoken by about 3 000 people in eastern Greenland  63  The dialects are hardly mutually intelligible and are considered by some linguists to be separate languages  As the Western Greenlandic standard has become dominant  a UNESCO report has labelled the other dialects as endangered  and measures are now being considered to protect the Eastern

the ice age  In the 10th century  Norwegian Vikings settled in the southern part of the island  while the Thule Inuit culture was introduced in the north of the island and expanded southward  The culture clash between two peoples is attested by the discovery of a fragment of chain mail Viking at high latitude of the island  while a figurine carved from walrus ivory Inuit clear assignment was found in Bergen  Norway  Both objects must be understood as a clear testimony of the trade between the two peoples  Inuit culture dominated the island from the end of the Middle Ages to the recolonisation in the early 18th century  where European culture was reintroduced  Today Greenlandic culture is a blending of traditional Inuit  Kalaallit  and Scandinavian culture  Inuit  or
