Maryland s neighbor West Virginia  is almost twice the size of Maryland  24 229 76 square miles  62 754 8 km2    Maryland possesses a variety of topography  hence its nickname   America in Miniature   9  It ranges from sandy dunes dotted with seagrass in the east  to low marshlands teeming with wildlife and large bald cypress near the bay  to gently rolling hills of oak forest in the Piedmont Region  and pine groves in the mountains to the west  Physical regions of Maryland  Tidal wetlands of the Chesapeake Bay  largest estuary in the United States and the largest water feature in Maryland  Maryland is bounded on its north by Pennsylvania  on its west by West Virginia  on its east by Delaware and the Atlantic Ocean  and on its south  across the Potomac River  by West Virginia and Virginia  The mid portion of this border is interrupted on the Maryland side by Washington  DC  which sits on land that was originally part of Maryland  The Chesapeake Bay nearly bisects the state  and the counties east of the bay are known collectively as the Eastern Shore  Most of the state s waterways are part of the Chesapeake Bay watershed  with the exceptions of a tiny portion of extreme western Garrett County  drained by the Youghiogheny River as part of the watershed of the Mississippi River   the eastern half of Worcester County  which drains into Maryland s Atlantic coastal bays   and a small portion of the state s northeast corner  which drains into the Delaware River watershed   So prominent is the Chesapeake in Maryland s geography and economic life that there has been periodic agitation to change the state s official nickname to the Bay State  a nickname that has actually been used by Massachusetts for a long time  The highest point in Maryland  with an elevation of 3 360 feet  1 020 m   is Hoye Crest on Backbone Mountain  in the southwest corner of Garrett County  near the border with West Virginia and near the headwaters of the North Branch of the Potomac River  Close to the small town of Hancock  in western Maryland  about two thirds of the way across the state  there is only 1 83 miles  2 95 km  between its borders  This geographical curiosity makes Maryland the narrowest state  bordered by the Mason Dixon Line to the north  and the northwards arching Potomac River to the south  Portions of Maryland are included in various official and unofficial geographic regions  For example  the Delmarva Peninsula is composed of the Eastern Shore counties of Maryland  the entire state of Delaware  and the two counties that make up the Eastern Shore of Virginia  whereas the westernmost counties of Maryland are considered part of Appalachia  Much of the Baltimore Washington corridor lies just south of the Piedmont in the Coastal Plain  10  though it straddles the border between the two regions  A quirk of the geography of Maryland is the absence of any natural lakes  11  though there are numerous ponds  During the latter Ice Ages  the glaciers did not reach as far south as Maryland  and therefore they did not carve out the deep natural lakes that exist in states farther north  There are numerous man made lakes  the largest of these being the Deep Creek Lake  a reservoir in Garrett County in westernmost Maryland  The lack of a glacial history also accounts for Maryland s soil  which is sandier and muddier than the rocky soils farther to the north and northeast   edit  Human geography See also  List of counties in Maryland  List of incorporated places in Maryland  and List of census designated places in Maryland Maryland counties The majority of Maryland s population is concentrated in the cities and suburbs surrounding Washington  DC  and also in and around Maryland s most populous city  Baltimore  Historically  these and many other Maryland cities developed along the Fall Line  the line along which rivers  brooks  and streams are interrupted by rapids and or waterfalls  Maryland s capital city  Annapolis  is one exception to this pattern  since it lies along the banks of the Severn River  close to where it empties into the Chesapeake Bay  The other population centers of Maryland include suburban areas of

Northern and Southern regions of the United States  Generally  rural Western Maryland between the West Virginian Panhandle and Pennsylvania has an Appalachian culture  the Southern and Eastern Shore regions of Maryland embody a Southern culture  12  while densely populated Central Maryland radiating outward from Baltimore and Washington  D C  has more in common with that of the Northeast  13  The

protection from colder weather due to downslope winds  The eastern half of Maryland lies on the Atlantic Coastal Plain  with very flat topography and very sandy or muddy soil  This region has a humid subtropical climate  with hot  humid summers and a short  mild to cool winter  This region includes the cities of Salisbury  Annapolis  Ocean City  and southern and eastern greater Baltimore  Sunset

subtropical highland  K ppen Cfb  19  zone  due to elevation  more typical of the Appalachian mountain region  with milder summers and cool  and snowy winters  Precipitation in the state is characteristic of the East Coast  Annual rainfall ranges from 35 to 45 inches  890 to 1 100 mm  with more in higher elevations  20  Nearly every part of Maryland receives 3 5 4 5 inches  89 110 mm

its location near the Atlantic Coast  Maryland is somewhat vulnerable to tropical cyclones  although the Delmarva Peninsula  and the outer banks of North Carolina to the south provide a large buffer  such that a strike from a major hurricane  category 3 or above  is not very likely but is not impossible  More often  Maryland might get the remnants of a tropical system which has already come ashore

edit  History Main article  History of Maryland Cecil Calvert  1st Proprietor of the Maryland colony  In 1629  George Calvert  1st Lord Baltimore in the Irish House of Lords  fresh from his failure further north with Newfoundland s Avalon colony  applied to Charles I for a new royal charter for what was to become the Province of Maryland  Calvert s interest in creating a colony derived from his Catholicism and his desire for the creation of a haven for Catholics in the new world  In addition  he was familiar with the fortunes that had been made in tobacco in Virginia  and hoped to recoup some of the financial losses he had sustained in his earlier colonial venture in Newfoundland  George Calvert died in April 1632  but a charter for  Maryland Colony   in Latin   Terra Maria   was granted to his son  C cilius Calvert  2nd Lord Baltimore  on June 20  1632  The new colony was named in honor of Henrietta Maria of France  wife of Charles I of England  37  The specific name given in the charter was phrased  Terra Mariae  anglice  Maryland   The English name was preferred over the Latin due in part to the undesired association of  Mariae  with the Spanish Jesuit Juan de Mariana  38  39  To try to gain settlers  Maryland used what is known as the headright system  which originated in Jamestown  On March 25  1634  Lord Baltimore sent the first settlers into this area  Although most of the settlers were Protestants  Maryland soon became one of the few regions in the English Empire where Catholics held the highest positions of political authority  Maryland was also one of the key destinations of tens of thousands of English convicts  The royal charter granted Maryland the land north of the entire length of the Potomac River up to the 40th parallel  A problem arose when Charles II granted a charter for Pennsylvania  The grant defined Pennsylvania s southern border as identical to Maryland s northern border  the 40th parallel  But the terms of the grant clearly indicate that Charles II and William Penn assumed the 40th parallel would pass close to New Castle  Delaware when in fact it falls north of Philadelphia  the site of which Penn had already selected for his colony s capital city  Negotiations ensued after the problem was discovered in 1681  A compromise proposed by Charles II in 1682  which might have resolved the issue  was undermined by Penn s receiving the additional grant of what is now Delaware which previously had been part of Maryland  40  The dispute remained unresolved for nearly a century  carried on by the descendants of William Penn and Lord Baltimore the Calvert family  which controlled Maryland  and the Penn family  which controlled Pennsylvania  The conflict led to the Cresap s War  also known as the Conojocular War   a border conflict between Pennsylvania and Maryland  fought in the 1730s  Hostilities erupted in 1730 with a series of violent incidents prompted by disputes over property rights and law enforcement  and escalated through the first half of the decade  culminating in the deployment of military forces by Maryland in 1736 and by Pennsylvania in 1737  The armed phase of the conflict ended in May 1738 with the intervention of King George II  who compelled the negotiation of a cease fire  A provisional agreement had been established in 1732  Negotiations continued until a final agreement was signed in 1760  The agreement defined Maryland s border with what is now Delaware as well as Pennsylvania  The border between Maryland and Pennsylvania was defined as the line of latitude 15 miles  24 km  south of the southernmost house of Philadelphia  a line now known as the Mason Dixon Line  Maryland s border with Delaware was based on a Transpeninsular Line and the Twelve Mile Circle around New Castle  40  An artist s rendering of the bombardment of Fort McHenry in Baltimore  which inspired the composition of the Star Spangled Banner  After Virginia made Anglicanism the established religion of the colony  numerous Puritans migrated from Virginia to Maryland  and were given land for a settlement called Providence  now Annapolis   In 1650  the Puritans revolted against the proprietary government and set up a new government that outlawed both Catholicism and Anglicanism  In March 1654  the 2nd Lord Baltimore sent an army under the command of Governor William Stone to put down the revolt  which was decisively defeated by a Puritan army near Annapolis in what was to be known as the Battle of the Severn 41  42  During the persecution of Catholics by the Puritan revolt  all of the original Catholic churches of southern Maryland were burned down  The Puritan revolt lasted until 1658 when the Calvert family regained control of the colony and re enacted the Toleration Act  However  after England s  Glorious Revolution  of 1688  when William of Orange came to the throne and established the Protestant faith in England  Maryland outlawed Catholicism until after the American Revolutionary War  Many wealthy Catholic planters built chapels on their land to practice their religion in relative secrecy  St  Mary s City was the largest site of the original Maryland colony  and was the seat of the colonial government until 1708  St Mary s is now a historical site  with a small tourist center  In 1708  the seat of government was moved to Providence  which had been renamed Annapolis  The city was renamed in honor of Queen Anne in 1694  Most of the English colonists arrived in Maryland as indentured servants  hiring themselves out as laborers for a fixed period to pay for their passage  43  In the early years the line between indentured servants and African slaves or laborers was fluid  and white and black laborers lived and worked together  Many of the free black families migrated to Delaware  where land was cheaper  44  As the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in England  thousands more slaves were imported and racial caste lines hardened  The economy s growth and prosperity was based on slave labor  devoted first to the production of tobacco  Maryland was one of the thirteen colonies that revolted against British rule in the American Revolution  On February 2  1781  Maryland became the 13th state to approve the ratification of the Articles of Confederation which brought into being the United States as a united  sovereign and national state  It also became the seventh state admitted to the U S  after ratifying the new Constitution  In December 1790  Maryland donated land selected by President George Washington to the federal government for the creation of the new national capital of Washington  D C  The land was provided from Montgomery and Prince George s counties  as well as from Fairfax County and Alexandria in Virginia  however  the land donated by Virginia was later returned to that state by the District of Columbia retrocession  The Battle of Antietam on September 17  1862   the single bloodiest day of the American Civil War and all of American military history  with nearly 23 000 casualties  During the War of 1812  the British military attempted to capture the port of Baltimore  which was protected by Fort McHenry  It was during this bombardment that the Star Spangled Banner was written by Francis Scott Key  As in Delaware  numerous planters in Maryland had freed their slaves in the twenty years after the Revolutionary War  By 1860 Maryland s free black population comprised 49 1  of the total of African Americans in the state  45  This contributed to the state s remaining loyal to the Union during the American Civil War  In addition  Governor Thomas Holliday Hicks temporarily suspended the state legislature  and President Abraham Lincoln had many of its fire eaters arrested prior to its reconvening  Of the 115 000 men who joined the military during the Civil War 85 000  or 77   joined the Union army  while the remainder joined the Confederate Army  To help ensure Maryland s inclusion in the Union  President Lincoln suspended several civil liberties  including the writ of habeas corpus  an act deemed illegal by Maryland native Chief Justice Roger Taney  Lincoln ordered U S  troops to place artillery on Federal Hill to threaten the city of Baltimore  and helped ensure the election of a new pro union governor and legislature  Lincoln went so far as to jail certain pro South members of the state legislature at Fort McHenry  including the Mayor of Baltimore  George William Brown  The grandson of Francis Scott Key was included in those jailed  The constitutionality of these actions is still debated  Because Maryland remained in the Union  it was exempted from the anti slavery provisions of the Emancipation Proclamation  The Emancipation Proclamation only applied to states in rebellion   In 1864 the state held a constitutional convention that culminated in the passage of a new state constitution  Article 24 of that document outlawed the practice of slavery  In 1867 the state extended suffrage to non white males   edit  Demographics Historical populations Census Pop     1790 319 728   1800 341 548 6 8  1810 380

Basilica was the first Roman Catholic cathedral built in the United States  It is considered to be the masterpiece of architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe  Maryland was founded for the purpose of providing religious toleration of England s Roman Catholic minority  Nevertheless  Parliament later reversed that policy and discouraged the practice of Catholicism in Maryland  Due to immigration patterns  Catholics have not been a majority in Maryland since early Colonial times  Nonetheless  Catholicism is the largest single denomination in Maryland  As of the year 2000  the RCMS 54  reported that the second and third largest denominational groups in Maryland are Mainline Protestant  and Evangelical Protestant  The Catholic Church has the highest number of adherents in Maryland  at 952 389   followed by the United Methodist Church with 297 729 members reported  Judaism is the largest non Christian religion with 241 000 adherents  or 4 3  of the total population  55  The Islamic

Maryland has been prominent in U S  Catholic tradition  partially because it was intended by George Calvert as a haven for English Catholics  Baltimore was the seat of the first Catholic bishop in the U S   1789   and Emmitsburg was the home and burial place of the first American born citizen to be canonized  St  Elizabeth Ann Seton  Georgetown University  the first Catholic University  was founded in 1789 in what was then part of Maryland  56  The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary in Baltimore was the first Roman Catholic cathedral built in the United States  and the Archbishop of Baltimore is  albeit without formal primacy  the United States  quasi primate  and often a Cardinal   edit  Economy Port of Baltimore See also  Business in Maryland  List of federal installations in Maryland  and List of shopping malls in Maryland The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that Maryland s gross state product in 2006 was US 257 billion  57  According to the U S  Census Bureau  Maryland households are currently the wealthiest in the country  with a 2009 median household income of  69 272 4  which puts it ahead of New Jersey and Connecticut  which are second and third respectively  Two of Maryland s counties  Howard and Montgomery  are the third and tenth wealthiest counties in the nation respectively  Also  the state s poverty rate of 7 8  is the lowest in the country  58  59  60  Per capita personal income in 2006 was US 43 500  5th in the nation  As of January 2010  the state s unemployment rate was 7 5   61  Maryland s economic activity is strongly concentrated in the tertiary service sector  and this sector  in turn  is strongly influenced by location  One major service activity is transportation  centered on the Port of Baltimore and its related rail and trucking access  The port ranked 17th in the U S  by tonnage in 2008  62  Although the port handles a wide variety of products  the most typical imports are raw materials and bulk commodities  such as iron ore  petroleum  sugar  and fertilizers  often distributed to the relatively close manufacturing centers of the inland Midwest via good overland transportation  The port also receives several different brands of imported motor vehicles and is the number two auto port in the U S  63  A second service activity takes advantage of the close location of the center of government in Washington  D C  and emphasizes technical and administrative tasks for the defense aerospace industry and bio research laboratories  as well as staffing of satellite government headquarters in the suburban or exurban Baltimore Washington area  In addition  many educational and medical research institutions are located in the state  In fact  the various components of The Johns Hopkins University and its medical research facilities are now the largest single employer in the Baltimore area  Altogether  white collar technical and administrative workers comprise 25  of Maryland s labor force  attributable in part to nearby Maryland being a part of the Washington Metro Area where the federal government office employment is relatively high  Maryland has a large food production sector  A large component of this is commercial fishing  centered in Chesapeake Bay  but also including activity off the short Atlantic seacoast  The largest catches by species are the blue crab  oysters  striped bass  and menhaden  The Bay also has uncounted millions of overwintering waterfowl in its many wildlife refuges  While not  strictly speaking  a commercial food resource  the waterfowl support a tourism sector of sportsmen  Agriculture is an important part of the state s economy  Maryland has large areas of fertile agricultural land in its coastal and Piedmont zones  though this land use is being encroached upon by urbanization  Agriculture is oriented to dairy farming  especially in foothill and piedmont areas  for nearby large city milksheads plus specialty perishable horticulture crops  such as cucumbers  watermelons  sweet corn  tomatoes  muskmelons  squash  and peas  Source USDA Crop Profiles   In addition  the southern counties of the western shoreline of Chesapeake Bay are warm enough to support a tobacco cash crop zone  which has existed since early Colonial times but declined greatly after a state government buyout in the 1990s  There is also a large automated chicken farming sector in the state s southeastern part  Salisbury is home to Perdue Farms  Maryland s food processing plants are the most significant type of manufacturing by value in the state  Manufacturing  while large in dollar value  is highly diversified with no sub sector contributing over 20  of the total  Typical forms of manufacturing include electronics  computer equipment  and chemicals  The once mighty primary metals sub sector  which at one time included what was then the largest steel factory in the world at Sparrows Point  still exists  but is pressed with foreign competition  bankruptcies  and company mergers  During World War II the Glenn L  Martin Company  now part of Lockheed Martin  airplane factory near Essex  MD employed some 40 000 people  Mining other than construction materials is virtually limited to coal  which is located in the mountainous western part of the state  The brownstone quarries in the east  which gave Baltimore and Washington much of their characteristic architecture in the mid 19th century  were once a predominant natural resource  Historically  there used to be small gold mining operations in Maryland  some surprisingly near Washington  but these no longer exist  Maryland imposes 5 income tax brackets  ranging from 2  to 6 25  of personal income  64  The city of Baltimore and Maryland s 23 counties levy local  piggyback  income taxes at rates between 1 25  and 3 2  of Maryland taxable income  Local officials set the rates and the revenue is returned to the local governments quarterly  The top income tax bracket of 9 45  is the fifth highest combined state and local income tax rates in the country  behind only New York City s 11 35   California s 10 3   Rhode Island s 9 9   and Vermont s 9 5   65  Maryland s state sales tax is 6   All real property in Maryland is subject to the property tax  Generally  properties that are owned and used by religious  charitable  or educational organizations or property owned by the federal  state or local governments are exempt  Property tax rates vary widely  No restrictions or limitations on property taxes are imposed by the state  meaning cities and counties can set tax rates at the level they deem necessary to fund governmental services  These rates can increase  decrease or remain the same from year to year  If the proposed tax rate increases the total property tax revenues  the governing body must advertise that fact and hold a public hearing on the new tax rate  This is called the Constant Yield Tax Rate process  Baltimore City is the eighth largest port in the nation  and was at the center of the February 2006 controversy over the Dubai Ports World deal because it was considered to be of such strategic importance  The state as a whole is heavily industrialized  with a booming economy and influential technology centers  Its computer industries are some of the most sophisticated in the United States  and the federal government has invested heavily in the area  Maryland is home to several large military bases and scores of high level government jobs   edit  Biotechnology Maryland is a major center for life sciences research and development  With more than 400 biotechnology companies located there  Maryland is the fourth largest nexus in this field in the United States  66  Institutions and government agencies with an

branches of government  executive  legislative  and judicial  The Maryland General Assembly is composed of the Maryland House of Delegates and the Maryland Senate  Maryland s governor is unique in the United States as the office is vested with significant authority in budgeting  The legislature may not increase the governor s proposed budget expenditures  Unlike most other states  significant autonomy is granted to many of Maryland s counties  Most of the business of government is conducted in Annapolis  the state capital  Virtually all state and county elections are held in even numbered years not divisible by four  in which the President of the United States is not elected   this  as in other states  is intended to divide state and federal politics  The judicial branch of state government consists of one united District Court of Maryland that sits in every county and Baltimore City  as well as 24 Circuit Courts sitting in each County and Baltimore City  the latter being courts of general jurisdiction for all civil disputes over  30 000 00  all equitable jurisdiction and major criminal proceedings  The intermediate appellate court is known as the  Court of Special

increased markedly  Results from the annual Bowhunter Survey and the Hunter Mail survey have identified bobcat sightings in 14 of Maryland s 23 counties  Currently  bobcats have dual legal classification in Maryland  In addition to the Species of Special Concern designation  they are also defined as a Game Animal   Furbearer with a closed harvest season       Coyotes in Maryland   Maryland Department of Natural Resources  http   www dnr state md us wildlife Hunt Trap furbearers coyote asp  Retrieved 16 September 2011   Coyotes were historically a western species with core populations found west of the Mississippi River  Alterations and or elimination of competing predators during the post European colonization period facilitated rapid range expansion into eastern North America during the 20th Century  Established populations now occur in every state and province in North America  Coyotes are a relatively new addition to local ecosystems  and were first documented in Maryland during 1972  Initial substantiated sightings occurred in Cecil  Frederick and Washington counties  Since that time population densities and occupied range have expanded incrementally and coyotes now occur statewide       Assateague Island National Seashore Wild Ponies   Assateagueisland com  http   www assateagueisland com wildlife pony htm  Retrieved 2010 10 24     a b  Chesapeake
