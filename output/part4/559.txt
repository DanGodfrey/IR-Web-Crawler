ChamberUnited States CapitolWashington  D C United States Website http   www senate gov The United States Senate is the upper house of the bicameral legislature of the United States  and together with the United States House of Representatives comprises the United States Congress  The composition and powers of the Senate are established in Article One of the U S  Constitution  1  Each U S  state is represented by two senators  regardless of population  Senators serve staggered six year terms  The chamber of the United States Senate is located in the north wing of the Capitol  in Washington  D C   the national capital  The House of Representatives convenes in the south wing of the same building  The Senate has several exclusive powers not granted to the House  including consenting to treaties as a precondition to their ratification and consenting or confirming appointments of Cabinet secretaries  federal judges  other federal executive officials  military officers  regulatory officials  ambassadors  and other federal uniformed officers  2  3  as well as trial of federal officials impeached by the House  The Senate is both a more deliberative 4  and more prestigious 5  body than the House of Representatives  due to its longer terms  smaller size  and statewide constituencies  which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere  6  Contents 1 History 2

States Senate  In England  at this day  if elections were open to all classes of people  the property of landed proprietors would be insecure  An agrarian law would soon take place  If these observations be just  our government ought to secure the permanent interests of the country against innovation  Landholders ought to have a share in the government  to support these invaluable interests  and to balance and check the other  They ought to be so constituted as to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority  The senate  therefore  ought to be this body  and to answer these purposes  they ought to have permanency and stability     James Madison  quoted in Notes of the Secret Debates of the Federal Convention of 1787 by Robert Yates The framers of the Constitution created a bicameral Congress primarily as a compromise between those who felt that each state  since it was sovereign  should be equally represented  and those who felt the Legislature must directly represent the People  as did the House of Commons in Britain  There was also a desire to have two Houses that could act as an internal check on each other  One was intended to be a  People s House  directly elected by the People  and with short terms obliging the representatives to remain close to their constituents  The other was intended to represent the states to such extent as they retained their sovereignty except for the powers expressly delegated to the national government  The Senate was thus not intended to represent the people of the United States equally  The Constitution provides that the approval of both chambers is necessary for the passage of legislation  7  The Senate of the United States was formed on the example of the ancient Roman Senate  The name is derived from the senatus  Latin for council of elders  from senex meaning old man in Latin   8  The Constitution stipulates that no constitutional amendment may be created to deprive a state of its equal suffrage in the Senate without that state s consent  The District of Columbia and all other territories  including territories  protectorates  etc   are not entitled to representation in either House of the Congress  The District of Columbia elects two shadow senators  but they are officials of the D C  city government and not members of the U S  Senate  9  The United States has had 50 states since 1959  10  thus the Senate has had 100 senators since 1959  11  The disparity between the most and least populous states has grown since the Connecticut Compromise  which granted each state two members of the Senate and at least one member of the House of Representatives  for a total minimum of three presidential Electors  regardless of population  In 1787  Virginia had roughly 10 times the population of Rhode Island  whereas today California has roughly 70 times the population of Wyoming  based on the 1790 and 2000 censuses  This means some citizens are effectively an order of magnitude better represented in the Senate than those in other states  Seats in the House of Representatives are approximately proportionate to the population of each state  reducing the disparity of representation  citation needed  Before the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment  senators were elected by the individual state legislatures  12  However  problems with repeated vacant seats due to the inability of a legislature to elect senators  intrastate political struggles  and even bribery and intimidation gradually led to a growing movement to amend the Constitution to allow for the direct election of senators  13   edit  Membership  edit  Qualifications This article is part of a series on the United States Senate History of the United States Senate Members Current members by

buildings Dirksen Hart Russell v t e Article I  Section 3 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for senators  1  each senator must be at least 35 years old  2  must have been a citizen of the United States for at least the past ten years  and 3  must be  at the time of the election  an inhabitant of the state he or she seeks to represent  The age and citizenship qualifications for senators are more stringent than those for representatives  In Federalist No  62  James Madison justified this arrangement by arguing that the  senatorial trust  called for a  greater extent of information and stability of character   The Senate  not the judiciary  is the sole judge of a senator s qualifications  During its early years  however  the Senate did not closely scrutinize the qualifications of members  As a result  three senators who failed to meet the age qualification were nevertheless admitted to the Senate  Henry Clay  aged 29 in 1806   Armistead Thomson Mason  aged 28 in 1816   and John Eaton  aged 28 in 1818   Such an occurrence  however  has not been repeated since  14  In 1934  Rush D  Holt  Sr  was elected to the Senate at the age of 29  he waited until he turned 30 to take the oath of office  Likewise  Joe Biden was elected to the Senate shortly before his 30th birthday in 1972  he had passed his 30th birthday by the time the Senate conducted its swearing in ceremony for that year s incoming senators in January 1973  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution disqualifies from the Senate any federal or state officers who had taken the requisite oath to support the Constitution  but later engaged in rebellion or aided the enemies of the United States  This provision  which came into force soon after the end of the Civil War  was intended to prevent those who sided with the Confederacy from serving  That Amendment  however  also provides a method to remove that disqualification  a two thirds vote of both chambers of Congress   edit  Elections and term See also  List of Current United States Senators and Elections in the United States Originally  senators were selected by the state legislatures  not by popular elections  By the early years of the 20th century  the legislatures of as many as 29 states had provided for popular election of senators by referendums  15  Popular election to the Senate was standardized nationally in 1913 by the ratification of the 17th Amendment   edit  Term Senators serve terms of six years each  the terms are staggered so that approximately one third of the seats are up for election every two years  This was achieved by dividing the senators of the 1st Congress into thirds  called classes   where the terms of one third expired after two years  the terms of another third expired after four  and the terms of the last third expired after six years  This arrangement was also followed after the admission of new states into the union  The staggering of terms has been arranged such that both seats from a given state are not contested in the same general election  except when a mid term vacancy is being filled  Current senators whose six year terms expire on January 3  2013  belong to Class I  A member who has been elected  but not yet seated  is called a  senator elect   a member who has been appointed to a seat  but not yet seated  is called a  senator designate    edit  Elections Elections to the Senate are held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November in even numbered years  Election Day  and coincide with elections for the House of Representatives  16  Senators are elected by their state as a whole  In most states  since 1970   a primary election is held first for the Republican and Democratic parties  with the general election following a few months later  Ballot access rules for independent and minor party candidates vary from state to state  The winner is the candidate who receives a plurality of the popular vote  In some states  runoffs are held if no candidate wins a majority   edit  Mid term vacancies The Seventeenth Amendment allows governors  with the approval of their legislature  to appoint temporary senators until either a special or regular election takes place  The official wording provides that  the legislature of any State may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct   Some states  as stated above  provide for a special election to fill a Senate vacancy  A special election need not be held immediately after the vacancy arises  often  it may wait until the next biennial congressional election  If a special election for one seat happens to coincide with a general election for the state s other seat  then the two elections are not combined  but are instead contested separately  A senator elected in a special election serves until the original six year term expires  not for a full term  Forty six states permit governors to make Senate appointments of varying lengths as of 2009  Oregon and Wisconsin require special elections for vacancies  and Oklahoma permits the governor to appoint only the winner of a special election  17  In September 2009  Massachusetts changed its law to enable the governor to appoint a temporary replacement for the late Senator Kennedy until the special election in January 2010  18  19  In 2004  Alaska enacted legislation and a separate ballot referendum that took effect on the same day  but that conflicted with each other  The effect of the ballot approved law is to withhold from the governor authority to appoint a senator  20  Because the 17th Amendment vests the power to grant that authority to the legislature   not the people or the state generally   it is unclear whether the ballot measure supplants the legislature s statute granting that authority  20  As a result  it is uncertain whether an Alaska governor may appoint an interim senator to serve until a special election is held to fill the vacancy  In 2009  Wisconsin Democratic Senator Russ Feingold announced he would introduce a bill proposing a constitutional amendment to require Senate vacancies be filled by special elections  as the Constitution already requires for vacancies in the House of Representatives  21  22  23   edit  Oath United States This template is part of the series

The Constitution requires that senators take an oath or affirmation to support the Constitution  24  Congress has prescribed the following oath for new senators    I           do solemnly swear  or affirm  that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies  foreign and domestic  that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same  that I take this obligation freely  without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion  and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter  So help me God  25     edit  Salary and benefits The annual salary of each senator  as of 2009  is  174 000  26  the president pro tempore and party leaders receive  193 400  27  In June 2003  at least 40 of the then senators were millionaires  28  Along with earning salaries  senators receive retirement and health benefits that are identical to other federal employees  and are fully vested after five years of service  27  Senators are covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System  FERS  or Civil Service Retirement System  CSRS   As it is for federal employees  congressional retirement is funded through taxes and the participants  contributions  Under FERS  senators contribute 1 3  of their salary into the FERS retirement plan and pay 6 2  of their salary in Social Security taxes  The amount of a senator s pension depends on the years of service and the average of the highest 3 years of their salary  The starting amount of a senator s retirement annuity may not exceed 80  of their final salary  In 2006  the average annual pension for retired senators and representatives under CSRS was  60 972  while those who retired under FERS  or in combination with CSRS  was  35 952  27   edit  Political prominence Senators are regarded as more prominent political figures than members of the House of Representatives because there are fewer of them  and because they serve for longer terms  usually represent larger constituencies  the exception being House at large districts  which similarly comprise entire states   sit on more committees  and have more staffers  Far more senators have been nominees for the presidency than representatives  Furthermore  three senators  Warren Harding  John F  Kennedy  and Barack Obama  have been elected president while serving in the Senate  while only one Representative  James Garfield  has been elected president while serving in the House  though Garfield was also a Senator elect at the time of his election to the Presidency  having been chosen by the Ohio Legislature to fill a Senate vacancy   edit  Seniority Main article  Seniority in the United States Senate According to the convention of Senate seniority  the senator with the longer tenure in each state is known as the  senior senator   the other is the  junior senator   This convention does not have official significance  though it is a factor in the selection of physical offices  29  In the 111th Congress  the most senior  junior senator  is Tom Harkin of Iowa  who was sworn in on January 3  1985 and is currently 11th in seniority  The most junior  senior senator  is Mark Udall of Colorado  who was sworn in on January 3  2009   just two weeks before the state s junior senator  Michael Bennet   and is currently 80th in seniority   edit  Expulsion and other disciplinary actions The Senate may expel a senator by a two thirds vote  Fifteen senators have been expelled in the history of the Senate  William Blount  for treason  in 1797  and fourteen in 1861 and 1862 for supporting the Confederate secession  Although no senator has been expelled since 1862  many senators have chosen to resign when faced with expulsion proceedings   for example  Bob Packwood in 1995  The Senate has also censured and condemned senators  censure requires only a simple majority and does not remove a senator from office  Some senators have opted to withdraw from their re election races rather than face certain censure or expulsion  such as Robert Torricelli in 2002   edit  Majority and minority parties The  Majority party  is the political party that either has a majority of seats or can form a coalition or caucus with a majority of seats  if two or more parties are tied  the vice president s affiliation determines which party is the majority party  The next largest party is known as the minority party  The president pro tempore  committee chairs  and some other officials are generally from the majority party  they have counterparts  for instance  the  ranking members  of committees  in the minority party  Independents and members of third parties  so long as they do not caucus with or support either of the larger parties  are not considered in determining which is the majority party   edit  Seating The Democratic Party always sits to the presiding officer s right  and the Republican Party always sits to the presiding officer s left  regardless which party has a majority of seats  citation needed  In this respect  the Senate differs from the House of Commons of the United Kingdom and other parliamentary bodies in the Commonwealth of Nations and elsewhere   edit  Officers This article needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   January 2011  The Senate side of the United States Capitol in Washington  D C  The Vice President of the United States presides over the Senate  but the party leaders have the real power and they control procedure  Many non member officers are also hired to run the day to day functions of the Senate   edit  Presiding over the Senate The Vice President of the United States is the ex officio President of the Senate  with authority to preside over the Senate s sessions  although he can vote only to break a tie  For decades the task of presiding over Senate sessions was one of the vice president s principal duties  Since the 1950s  vice presidents have presided over few Senate debates  Instead  they have usually presided only on ceremonial occasions  such as joint sessions  or at times when a tie vote on an important issue is anticipated  The Constitution authorizes the Senate to elect a president pro tempore  Latin for  president for a time   to preside in the vice president s absence  the most senior senator of the majority party is customarily chosen to serve in this position  Like the vice president  the president pro tempore does not normally preside over the Senate  but typically delegates the responsibility of presiding to junior senators of the majority party  usually in blocks of one hour on a rotating basis  Frequently  freshmen senators  newly elected members  are asked to preside so that they may become accustomed to the rules and procedures of the body  The presiding officer sits in a chair in the front of the Senate chamber  The powers of the presiding officer of the Senate are far less extensive than those of the Speaker of the House  The presiding officer calls on senators to speak  by the rules of the Senate  the first senator who rises is recognized   ruling on points of order  objections by senators that a rule has been breached  subject to appeal to the whole chamber   and announcing the results of votes   edit  Party leaders Each party elects Senate party leaders  Floor leaders act as the party chief spokespeople  The Senate Majority Leader is responsible for controlling the agenda of the chamber by scheduling debates and votes  Each party elects an assistant leader  whip  who works to ensure that their party s senators vote as the party leadership desires   edit  Non member officers The Senate is served by several officials who are not members  The Senate s chief administrative officer is the Secretary of the Senate  who maintains public records  disburses salaries  monitors the acquisition of stationery and supplies  and oversees clerks  The Assistant Secretary of the Senate aids the secretary in his or her work  Another official is the Sergeant at Arms who  as the Senate s chief law enforcement officer  maintains order and security on the Senate premises  The Capitol Police handle routine police work  with the sergeant at arms primarily responsible for general oversight  Other employees include the Chaplain  who is elected by the Senate  and Pages  who are appointed   edit  Procedure  edit  Daily sessions A typical Senate desk The Senate uses Standing Rules of the Senate for operation  Like the House of Representatives  the Senate meets in the United States Capitol in Washington  D C  At one end of the chamber of the Senate is a dais from which the presiding officer presides  The lower tier of the dais is used by clerks and other officials  One hundred desks are arranged in the chamber in a semicircular pattern and are divided by a wide central aisle  By tradition  Republicans sit to the right of the center aisle and Democrats to the left  facing the presiding officer  30  Each senator chooses a desk based on seniority within the party  By custom  the leader of each party sits in the front row along the center aisle  Sessions of the Senate are opened with a special prayer or invocation and typically convene on weekdays  Sessions of the Senate are generally open to the public and are broadcast live on television  usually by C SPAN 2  Senate procedure depends not only on the rules  but also on a variety of customs and traditions  The Senate commonly waives some of its stricter rules by unanimous consent  Unanimous consent agreements are typically negotiated beforehand by party leaders  A senator may block such an agreement  but in practice  objections are rare  The presiding officer enforces the rules of the Senate  and may warn members who deviate from them  The presiding officer sometimes uses the gavel of the Senate to maintain order  A  hold  is placed when the leader s office is notified that a senator intends to object to a request for unanimous consent from the Senate to consider or pass a measure  A hold may be placed for any reason and can be lifted by a senator at any time  A senator may place a hold simply to review a bill  to negotiate changes to the bill  or to kill the bill  A bill can be held for as long as the senator who objects to the bill wishes to block its consideration  Holds can be overcome  but require time consuming procedures such as filing cloture  Holds are considered private communications between a senator and the Leader  and are sometimes referred to as  secret holds   A senator may disclose that he or she has placed a hold  The Constitution provides that a majority of the Senate constitutes a quorum to do business  Under the rules and customs of the Senate  a quorum is always assumed present unless a quorum call explicitly demonstrates otherwise  A senator may request a quorum call by  suggesting the absence of a quorum   a clerk then calls the roll of the Senate and notes which members are present  In practice  senators rarely request quorum calls to establish the presence of a quorum  Instead  quorum calls are generally used to temporarily delay proceedings  usually such delays are used while waiting for a senator to reach the floor to speak or to give leaders time to negotiate  Once the need for a delay has ended  a senator may request unanimous consent to rescind the quorum call   edit  Debate Debate  like most other matters governing the internal functioning of the Senate  is governed by internal rules adopted by the Senate  During debate  senators may only speak if called upon by the presiding officer  but the presiding officer is required to recognize the first senator who rises to speak  Thus  the presiding officer has little control over the course of debate  Customarily  the Majority Leader and Minority Leader are accorded priority during debates even if another senator rises first  All speeches must be addressed to the presiding officer  who is addressed as  Mr  President  or  Madam President   and not to another member  other Members must be referred to in the third person  In most cases  senators do not refer to each other by name  but by state or position  using forms such as  the senior senator from Virginia    the gentlewoman from California   or  my distinguished friend the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee   Senators address the Senate standing next to their desk  31  Apart from rules governing civility  there are few restrictions on the content of speeches  there is no requirement that speeches be germane to the matter before the Senate  The rules of the Senate provide that no senator may make more than two speeches on a motion or bill on the same legislative day  A legislative day begins when the Senate convenes and ends with adjournment  hence  it does not necessarily coincide with the calendar day  The length of these speeches is not limited by the rules  thus  in most cases  senators may speak for as long as they please  Often  the Senate adopts unanimous consent agreements imposing time limits  In other cases  for example  for the budget process   limits are imposed by statute  However  the right to unlimited debate is generally preserved   edit  Filibuster and cloture Main articles  Filibuster  United States Senate  and Reconciliation  United States Congress  The filibuster is a tactic used to defeat bills and motions by prolonging debate indefinitely  A filibuster may entail long speeches  dilatory motions  and an extensive series of proposed amendments  The Senate may end a filibuster by invoking cloture  In most cases  cloture requires the support of three fifths of the Senate  however  if the matter before the Senate involves changing the rules of the body   this includes amending provisions regarding the filibuster   a two thirds majority is required  In current practice  the threat of filibuster is more important than its use  almost any motion that does not have the support of three fifths of the Senate effectively fails  This means that 41 senators  which could represent as little as 12 3  of the U S  population  can make a filibuster happen  Historically  cloture has rarely been invoked because bipartisan support is usually necessary to obtain the required supermajority  so a bill that already has bipartisan support is rarely subject to threats of filibuster  However  motions for cloture have increased significantly in recent years  If the Senate invokes cloture  debate does not end immediately  instead  it is limited to 30 additional hours unless increased by another three fifths vote  The longest filibuster speech in the history of the Senate was delivered by Strom Thurmond  who spoke for over 24 hours in an unsuccessful attempt to block the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957  32  Under certain circumstances  the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 provides for a process called  reconciliation  by which Congress can pass bills related to the budget without those bills being subject to a filibuster  This is accomplished by limiting all Senate floor debate to 20 hours  33   edit  Voting When debate concludes  the motion in question is put to a vote  The Senate often votes by voice vote  The presiding officer puts the question  and Members respond either  Yea   in favor of the motion  or  Nay   against the motion   The presiding officer then announces the result of the voice vote  A senator  however  may challenge the presiding officer s assessment and request a recorded vote  The request may be granted only if it is seconded by one fifth of the senators present  In practice  however  senators second requests for recorded votes as a matter of courtesy  When a recorded vote is held  the clerk calls the roll of the Senate in alphabetical order  senators respond when their name is called  Senators who were not in the chamber when their name was called may still cast a vote so long as the voting remains open  The vote is closed at the discretion of the presiding officer  but must remain open for a minimum of 15 minutes  If the vote is tied  the vice president  if present  is entitled to a casting vote  If the vice president is not present  the motion fails  34   edit  Closed session Main article  Closed session of the United States Congress On occasion  the Senate may go into what is called a secret or closed session  During a closed session  the chamber doors are closed  cameras are turned off  and the galleries are completely cleared of anyone not sworn to secrecy  not instructed in the rules of the closed session  or not essential to the session  Closed sessions are rare and usually held only when the Senate is discussing sensitive subject matter such as information critical to national security  private communications from the president  or deliberations during impeachment trials  A senator may call for and force a closed session if the motion is seconded by at least one other member  but an agreement usually occurs beforehand  35  If the Senate does not approve release of a secret transcript  the transcript is stored in the Office of Senate Security and ultimately sent to the national archives  The proceedings remain sealed indefinitely until the Senate votes to remove the injunction of secrecy  36   edit  Calendars The Senate maintains a Senate Calendar and an Executive Calendar  37  The former identifies bills and resolutions awaiting Senate floor actions  The latter identifies executive resolutions  treaties  and nominations reported out by Senate committee s  and awaiting Senate floor action  Both are updated each day the Senate is in session   edit  Committees Dirksen Senate Office Building Committee Room 226 is used for hearings by the Senate Judiciary Committee  Main article  U S  Congressional committee See List of United States Senate committees for the full list  The Senate uses committees  and their subcommittees  for a variety of purposes  including the review of bills and the oversight of the executive branch  Formally  the whole Senate appoints committee members  In practice  however  the choice of members is made by the political parties  Generally  each party honors the preferences of individual senators  giving priority based on seniority  Each party is allocated seats on committees in proportion to its overall strength  Most committee work is performed by 16 standing committees  each of which has jurisdiction over a field such as finance or foreign relations  Each standing committee may consider  amend  and report bills that fall under its jurisdiction  Furthermore  each standing committee considers presidential nominations to offices related to its jurisdiction   For instance  the Judiciary Committee considers nominees for judgeships  and the Foreign Relations Committee considers nominees for positions in the Department of State   Committees may block nominees and impede bills from reaching the floor of the Senate  Standing committees also oversee the departments and agencies of the executive branch  In discharging their duties  standing committees have the power to hold hearings and to subpoena witnesses and evidence  The Senate also has several committees that are not considered standing committees  Such bodies are generally known as select or special committees  examples include the Select Committee on Ethics and the Special Committee on Aging  Legislation is referred to some of these committees  although the bulk of legislative work is performed by the standing committees  Committees may be established on an ad hoc basis for specific purposes  for instance  the Senate Watergate Committee was a special committee created to investigate the Watergate scandal  Such temporary committees cease to exist after fulfilling their tasks  The Congress includes joint committees  which include members from both the Senate and the House of Representatives  Some joint committees oversee independent government bodies  for instance  the Joint Committee on the Library oversees the Library of Congress  Other joint committees serve to make advisory reports  for example  there exists a Joint Committee on Taxation  Bills and nominees are not referred to joint committees  Hence  the power of joint committees is considerably lower than those of standing committees  Each Senate committee and subcommittee is led by a chair  usually a member of the majority party   Formerly  committee chairs were determined purely by seniority  as a result  several elderly senators continued to serve as chair despite severe physical infirmity or even senility  38  Committee chairs are elected  but  in practice  seniority is rarely bypassed  The chairs hold extensive powers  they control the committee s agenda  and so decide how much  if any  time to devote to the consideration of a bill  they act with the power of the committee in disapproving or delaying a bill or a nomination by the president  they manage on the floor of the full Senate the consideration of those bills the committee reports  This last role was particularly important in mid century  when floor amendments were thought not to be collegial  They also have considerable influence  senators who cooperate with their committee chairs are likely to accomplish more good for their states than those who do not  The Senate rules and customs were reformed in the twentieth century  largely in the 1970s  Committee chairmen have less power and are generally more moderate and collegial in exercising it  than they were before reform  39  The second highest member  the spokesperson on the committee for the minority party  is known in most cases as the ranking member  40  In the Select Committee on Intelligence and the Select Committee on Ethics  however  the senior minority member is known as the vice chair  Recent criticisms of the Senate s operations object to what the critics argue is obsolescence as a result of partisan paralysis and a preponderance of arcane rules  41  42  43   edit  Functions of the Senate  edit  Legislative functions Further information  Act of Congress Bills may be introduced in either chamber of Congress  However  the Constitution provides that  All bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives   As a result  the Senate does not have the power to initiate bills imposing taxes  Furthermore  the House of Representatives holds that the Senate does not have the power to originate appropriation bills  or bills authorizing the expenditure of federal funds  Historically  the Senate has disputed the interpretation advocated by the House  However  when the Senate originates an appropriations bill  the House simply refuses to consider it  thereby settling the dispute in practice  The constitutional provision barring the Senate from introducing revenue bills is based on the practice of the British Parliament  in which only the House of Commons may originate such measures  Although the Constitution gave the House the power to initiate revenue bills  in practice the Senate is equal to the House in the respects of taxation and spending  As Woodrow Wilson wrote  44    The Senate s right to amend general appropriation bills has been allowed the widest possible scope  The upper house may add to them what it pleases  may go altogether outside of their original provisions and tack to them entirely new features of legislation  altering not only the amounts but even the objects of expenditure  and making out of the materials sent them by the popular chamber measures of an almost totally new character    The approval of both houses is required for any bill  including a revenue bill  to become law  Both Houses must pass the same version of the bill  if there are differences  they may be resolved by sending amendments back and forth or by a conference committee  which includes members of both bodies   edit  Checks and balances The Constitution provides several unique functions for the Senate that form its ability to  check and balance  the powers of other elements of the Federal Government  These include the requirement that the Senate may advise and must consent to some of the president s government appointments  also the Senate must ratify all treaties with foreign governments  it tries all impeachments  and it elects the vice president in the event no person gets a majority of the electoral votes  The Senate has the power to try impeachments  shown above is Theodore R  Davis  drawing of the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson  1868  The president can make certain appointments only with the advice and consent of the Senate  Officials whose appointments require the Senate s approval include members of the Cabinet  heads of most federal executive agencies  ambassadors  Justices of the Supreme Court  and other federal judges  Under Article II  Section 2 of the Constitution  a large number of government appointments are subject to potential confirmation  however  Congress has passed legislation to authorize the appointment of many officials without the Senate s consent  usually  confirmation requirements are reserved for those officials with the most significant final decision making authority   Typically  a nominee is first subject to a hearing before a Senate committee  Thereafter  the nomination is considered by the full Senate  The majority of nominees are confirmed  but in a small number of cases each year  Senate Committees will purposely fail to act on a nomination to block it  In addition  the president sometimes withdraws nominations when they appear unlikely to be confirmed  Because of this  outright rejections of nominees on the Senate floor are infrequent  there have been only nine Cabinet nominees rejected outright in the history of the United States   citation needed  The powers of the Senate concerning nominations are  however  subject to some constraints  For instance  the Constitution provides that the president may make an appointment during a congressional recess without the Senate s advice and consent  The recess appointment remains valid only temporarily  the office becomes vacant again at the end of the next congressional session  Nevertheless  presidents have frequently used recess appointments to circumvent the possibility that the Senate may reject the nominee  Furthermore  as the Supreme Court held in Myers v  United States  although the Senate s advice and consent is required for the appointment of certain executive branch officials  it is not necessary for their removal  45  The Senate also has a role in ratifying treaties  The Constitution provides that the president may only  make Treaties  provided two thirds of the Senators present concur   However  not all international agreements are considered treaties under US domestic law  even if they are considered treaties under international law  Congress has passed laws authorizing the president to conclude executive agreements without action by the Senate  Similarly  the president may make congressional executive agreements with the approval of a simple majority in each House of Congress  rather than a two thirds majority in the Senate  Neither executive agreements nor congressional executive agreements are mentioned in the Constitution  leading some scholars such as Laurence Tribe and John Yoo 46  to suggest that they unconstitutionally circumvent the treaty ratification process  However  courts have upheld the validity of such agreements  47  The Constitution empowers the House of Representatives to impeach federal officials for  Treason  Bribery  or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors  and empowers the Senate to try such impeachments  If the sitting President of the United States is being tried  the Chief Justice of the United States presides over the trial  During an impeachment trial  senators are constitutionally required to sit on oath or affirmation  Conviction requires a two thirds majority of the senators present  A convicted official is automatically removed from office  in addition  the Senate may stipulate that the defendant be banned from holding office  No further punishment is permitted during the impeachment proceedings  however  the party may face criminal penalties in a normal court of law  In the history of the United States  the House of Representatives has impeached sixteen officials  of whom seven were convicted   One resigned before the Senate could complete the trial   48  Only two presidents of the United States have ever been impeached  Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998  Both trials ended in acquittal  in Johnson s case  the Senate fell one vote short of the two thirds majority required for conviction  Under the Twelfth Amendment  the Senate has the power to elect the vice president if no vice presidential candidate receives a majority of votes in the Electoral College  The Twelfth Amendment requires the Senate to choose from the two candidates with the highest numbers of electoral votes  Electoral College deadlocks are rare  In the history of the United States  the Senate has only broken a deadlock once  In 1837  it elected Richard Mentor Johnson  The House elects the president if the Electoral College deadlocks on that choice   edit  Current
