the diversity in attitudes toward LGBT rights  the status of LGBT civil rights in the U S  is at present a patchwork  At the federal level  there is no recognition of same sex unions and no laws forbidding employment discrimination against LGBT persons  Some states have enacted such laws  however   edit  Family law Laws regarding same sex partnerships in the United States   Same sex marriage1

article on same sex marriage in California  v t e See also  Same sex marriage law in the United States by state  edit  Judicial history In 1972  the Supreme Court of Minnesota in Baker v  Nelson ruled that it did not violate the federal Constitution for a state to deny a civil marriage license to a same sex couple  The controversy over same sex marriage was revived in 1993  when the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled that the state constitutional ban on sex discrimination meant that same sex couples were entitled to a civil marriage license unless the state could prove a compelling state interest  3  A lower court in Hawaii then found that the state had failed to show such a compelling interest  4  and same sex marriage was legal in Hawaii for a day  before the judge stayed his ruling and the state constitution was amended in 1998 to allow the legislature to restrict marriage to different sex couples While the events in Hawaii did not actually lead to marriage rights for same sex couples  they helped prompt the United States Congress to enact the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996  which forbade the federal government from recognizing same sex unions and permitted states to decide for themselves whether to recognize same sex unions performed in other jurisdictions  until that point  there had been a controversy over whether states would be required to extend marriage rights to couples married in other states  The rights and responsibilities of marriage granted at the federal level  thus  do not apply to same sex unions  Several states followed Congress and enacted similar laws denying recognition of marriage or other forms of union between two persons of the same sex  The landmark case Braschi v  Stahl  74 N Y 2d 201  1989  redefined  family unit  in the State of New York  Miguel Braschi  brother of the prominent Puerto Rican writer Giannina Braschi  lived in a rent controlled apartment with his gay partner Leslie Blanchard  When Blanchard died  the landlord Stahl  amp  Associates notified Braschi that he was to be evicted because his name was not on the lease  The Trial Court found that that the long term interdependent nature of the 10 year relationship between the two men  fulfills any definitional criteria of the term  family    The Appellate Court reversed  Braschi appealed  The New York Supreme Court reversed the Appellate Court and granted the injunction to Braschi  The New York Supreme Court noted that the term family was not defined in the Statute  and there was no specific reference in the legislative history to the noneviction provision   edit  Legislative history In 1999  the Vermont State Supreme Court ruled in Baker v  Vermont that the state had to offer the benefits and responsibilities of civil marriage to same sex couples  and thus the state legislature enacted a civil unions bill  In 2007  the legislature introduced a bill to legalize same sex marriage  The bill passed in 2009 but was vetoed by the governor  However  the legislature overrode the veto  and the law became effective on September 1  2009  In 2004  the Massachusetts Supreme Court  in Goodridge v  Department of Public Health  legalized same sex marriage in Massachusetts  In 2007 a similar decision in Iowa ruled that restriction of marriage to opposite sex couples was discriminatory  The decision was stayed to allow the state to appeal  although not before one same sex couple had been issued a marriage license  In 2009  the Iowa Supreme Court unanimously upheld the lower court s ruling and marriage licenses to same sex couples became available on April 24  2009  In May 2009  Maine passed a marriage equality law  Same sex marriage opponents placed a referendum to repeal the law on the November ballot and were successful in their repeal bid  In 2010  Washington  D  C  legislatively enacted marriage equality in the district  In June 2011  New York legalized same sex marriages  These state court opinions prompted calls for a Federal Marriage Amendment  along with state amendments to ensure that courts would not change the civil definition of marriage  As of 2007  the legal options available to same sex couples depend on what state they reside in  Hawaii  1997   California  1999   Maine  2004   Connecticut  2005   New Jersey  2007   Washington  2007   Oregon  2008   Maryland  2008   Colorado  2009   Wisconsin  2009   Nevada  2009   Illinois  2011   Rhode Island  2011  5  and Delaware  2012  have either civil unions or more limited domestic partnership options for same sex couples   edit  State constitutional amendments However  a backlash of these efforts was felt during the 2004 election cycle where fourteen states amended their constitution to ban recognition of same sex marriages and often civil unions as well  Mississippi voters amended their constitution  86  to 14    the largest margin in any state 6  7    to ban same sex marriage and to prohibit the state from recognizing same sex marriages that are legal elsewhere  Laws in Virginia  Michigan  Nebraska and Ohio  the most far reaching  forbids recognition of any benefits similar to those of marriage between people of the same sex   edit  State adoption laws Main article  Same sex adoption United States Legal status of adoption by same sex couples in the United States   Gay adoption legal1   Step child adoption   Gay adoption illegal   Unknown Ambiguous 1Maryland s same sex marriage law  which would permit same sex adoption  will not go into effect until January 1  2013  A single gay person or a same sex couple can adopt in some states  8  although there are fewer states where they may adopt children jointly with their partners  8   edit  Public opinion A March 2011 public opinion poll by ABC News Washington Post showed support for gay marriage at 53  among Americans  9  and a May 2011 Gallup opinion poll also showed 53  support for gay marriage among Americans  10  A May 2009 Gallup poll indicated 54  support for gays and lesbians being allowed to adopt children  11  Older polls showed that the nation could be divided into roughly equal thirds  one third supports gay marriage completely  another supports only civil unions  and the last is against any form of union entirely  12  13  However  in terms of attitudes to homosexuality  the United States can hardly be called one country  It is common for polls to show a clear majority support for gay marriage in Northeastern states  and occasionally  but less frequently   Pacific Coast states  States that have consistently shown a majority support for gay marriage for at least the past few years include Massachusetts  Vermont  Connecticut  Rhode Island  New York  14  New Jersey  15  New Hampshire  and the capital  as well as  occasionally  Hawaii  Oregon  and Washington  While the majority of these states do not  currently  have gay marriage  Iowa  which does have gay marriage  does not have majority support  in fact  polls place support in the high thirties or low forties  still slightly higher than the national average   In New York  meanwhile  where there is a pretty clear majority support  consistently reported as at least a four point lead since 2005   marriage only became legal on 24 July  2011  and previously there had been nothing  despite the clear public opinion favoring marriage continuously for at least 6 years   Nonetheless  Iowa falls into a second category of states  where the incoming voting generation overwhelmingly supports gay marriage  those under thirty have support placed in the sixties  16  17   edit  Anti discrimination laws  edit  Military service Prior to 1993  lesbian and gay people were not permitted to serve in the US military  Under the  Don t ask  don t tell  policy enacted that year  they were permitted to do so only if they did not disclose their orientation  However  on December 18  2010  The U  S  Senate voted 65 31 in favor of the Don t Ask  Don t Tell Repeal Act of 2010 permitting homosexual men and women to serve openly in the armed forces  to take effect 60 days after certification by the President  Secretary  and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  President Barack Obama signed the repeal on December 22  2010  18  On July 22  2011  President Obama  Defense Secretary Leon Panetta  and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  Admiral Michael Mullen certified that the military was ready for the repeal and that it would take place in 60 days  Repeal of the ban on gays in the military took effect September 20th  2011  Gays and lesbians are now free to serve openly   19  Transsexual and Intersex service members however are still banned from serving openly  due to Department of Defense medical policies 20    edit  Employment Current U S  LGBT employment discrimination laws All employment    Sexual orientation and gender identity   Sexual orientation only State employment    Sexual orientation and gender identity   Sexual orientation only   No state level protection for LGBT employees Animation showing the evolution of U S  LGBT employment discrimination laws  Employment discrimination refers to discriminatory employment practices such as bias in hiring  promotion  job assignment  termination  and compensation  and various types of harassment  In the United States there is  very little statutory  common law  and case law establishing employment discrimination based upon sexual orientation as a legal wrong   21  Some exceptions and alternative legal strategies are available  President Bill Clinton s Executive Order 13087  1998  prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation in the competitive service of the federal civilian workforce  22  and federal non civil service employees may have recourse under the due process clause of the U S  Constitution  23  Private sector workers may have a Title VII action under a quid pro quo sexual harassment theory  24  a  hostile work environment  theory  25  a sexual stereotyping theory  26  or others  27  Twenty one states  the District of Columbia  and over 140 cities and counties have enacted such bans  The states banning sexual orientation discrimination in employment are California  Colorado  Connecticut  Delaware  Hawaii  Illinois  Iowa  Maine  Maryland  Massachusetts  Minnesota  Nevada  New Hampshire  New Jersey  New Mexico  New York  Oregon  Rhode Island  Vermont  Washington  and Wisconsin  the first state to do so  in 1982   28  Four states have laws prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination in public workplaces only  Indiana  Michigan  Montana  and Pennsylvania  On November 22  2007  Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm issued an order guarding the rights of transgender men and women  She prohibited discrimination of state workers based on gender identity or expression  29  Many of these laws also ban discrimination in other contexts  such as housing or public accommodation  A proposed bill to ban anti gay employment discrimination nationwide  known as the Employment Non Discrimination Act  ENDA   has been introduced in the U S  Congress  but its prospects of passage are not believed to be good under a Republican controlled Congress  Sixteen states plus the District of Columbia 30  have reformed their state civil rights code by legislation or under the force of court decisions to include both sexual orientation and gender identity  while another five states have amended their civil rights code to include sexual orientation  but not gender identity  citation needed  Aside from state law  about a hundred cities in thirty three states have enacted civil rights legislation that includes sexual orientation  citation needed   edit  Housing States that prohibit housing discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity  HUD regulations require all housing providers that receive HUD funding not to discriminate against an individual s sexual orientation or gender identity    Prohibits housing discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity   Prohibits housing discrimination based on sexual orientation only   Does not factor sexual orientation or gender identity unclear Housing discrimination refers to discrimination against potential or current tenants by landlords  In the United States  there is no federal law against such discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity  but at least twenty one states and many major cities have enacted laws prohibiting it  31  See  for example  Washington House Bill 2661  In 2012  The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity issued a regulation to prohibit LGBT discrimination in federally assisted housing programs  The new regulations ensure that the Department s core housing programs are open to all eligible persons  regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity   edit  Medical facilities On April 14  2011  President Barack Obama issued an Executive Order to the Department of Health and Human Services to draft new rules for all hospitals accepting Medicare or Medicaid funds  They would require facilities to grant visitation and medical decision making rights to gay and lesbian partners  as well as designees of others such as widows and widowers  32  Such rights are not institutionalized in law in many states  Obama said he was inspired by the case of a Florida family  where one of the mothers died while her partner and four children were denied visitation by the hospital  32   edit  Hate crime laws Main article  Hate crime laws in the United States Current U S  LGBT hate crimes laws by state  A national hate crimes law encompasses both sexual orientation and gender identity    Sexual orientation and gender identity recognized in state hate crimes law   Sexual orientation recognized in state hate crimes law   Sexual orientation recognized for data collection about hate crimes   State hate crimes law uninclusive of sexual orientation or gender identity Hate crime laws  also known as bias crimes laws  protect against crimes motivated by feelings of enmity against a protected class  Until 2009  statutes permitted federal prosecution of hate crimes committed against a person s race  color  religion  or nation origin when engaging in a federally protected activity  see 1969 hate crime law   On April 2009  the House of Representatives passed H R 1913  the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009  which would define hate crimes in federal law to include gender  sexual orientation  gender identity  and disability  The legislation would also remove the prerequisite that victims of hate crimes be engaging in a federally protected activity  see Matthew Shepard Act   On July 16  2009  the US Senate also passed a Hate Crimes bill  originally S 909  as an amendment to the 2009 Defense Appropriations bill  On October 8  2009  the House of Representatives voted 281 to 146 to approve the Conference Report Department of Defense Authorization  which contained the hate crimes provisions  On October 22  2009  the U S  Senate voted 68 to 29 to approve the Conference Report Department of Defense Authorization  which contained the hate crimes provisions  33  On October 28  2009 President Obama signed the bill into law  34  The DOJ FBI  as well as campus security authorities  are required to collect and publish hate crime statistics  see Hate Crime Statistics Act and Campus Hate Crimes Right to Know Act   Forty five states and the District of Columbia have statutes criminalizing various types of bias motivated violence or intimidation  the exceptions are AR  GA  IN  SC  and WY   Each of these statutes covers bias on the basis of race  religion  and ethnicity  32 cover disability  31 of them cover sexual orientation  28 cover gender  13 cover age  13 cover transgender gender identity  5 cover political affiliation  35  31 states and the District of Columbia have statutes creating a civil cause of action  in addition to the criminal penalty  for similar acts  35  27 states and the District of Columbia have statutes requiring the state to collect hate crime statistics  16 of these cover sexual orientation  35  In Wisconsin v  Mitchell  1993  the Supreme Court unanimously held that state penalty enhancement laws for hate crimes were constitutional and did not violate First Amendment rights to freedom of thought and expression   edit  Reparations Reparations for gays and lesbians in the United States were first proposed by Robert DeKoven  a professor at California Western School of Law in San Diego  36  DeKoven cited the examples of the European Court of Human Rights as a model  New York University Professor and lawyer Jacob Appel was the first pundit to champion such a cause in a mainstream media outlet  37  However  such proposals remain highly controversial   edit  Supreme Court decisions US sodomy laws by the year when they were repealed or struck down  Sodomy laws remaining as of 2003 were struck down by the U S  Supreme Court in Lawrence v  Texas   Laws repealed or struck down before 1970    Laws repealed or struck down from 1970 to 1989    Laws repealed or struck down from 1989 to 2002    Laws struck down by the US Supreme Court in 2003  In March 1956  a Federal District Court ruled that ONE  The Homosexual Magazine  was obscene under the Federal Comstock laws and thus could not be sent through the United States Postal Service  This ruling was upheld by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals  but in 1958  the Supreme Court of the United States issued a landmark ruling in One  Inc  v  Olesen  355 U S  371  which overturned the previous rulings under a new legal precedent that had been established by the landmark case  Roth v  United States  354 U S  476  1957   As a result  gay newspapers  magazines and other publications could be lawfully distributed through the public mail service  On May 22  1967  the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952  which among other things banned homosexuals  as constitutional  This ban remained in effect until 1991  38  In 1972  a Tacoma  Washington teacher of twelve years with a perfect record was terminated after a former student outed him to the vice principal  The Washington Supreme Court found that homosexuality was immoral and impaired his efficiency as a teacher  The court supported its conclusion in various ways  including the definition of homosexuality in the New Catholic Encyclopedia  the criminal nature of homosexual conduct  and finding that an  immoral  person could not be trusted to instruct students as his presence would be inherently disruptive  On October 3  1977  the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari  although Justices Brennan and Marshall would have granted cert  This was the first homosexual discrimination decision to be aired on national network news  In fact  it was simultaneously aired on all three national network evening news shows  reaching approximately 60 million viewers  39  40  41  42  43  In 1985  the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of Gay Student Services v  Texas A amp M University  letting stand an appellate ruling ordering the university to provide official recognition of a student organization for homosexual students  The case set a national precedent by removing legal restrictions against gay rights groups on college campuses  44  On June 30  1986  the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Bowers v  Hardwick  that homosexual sex was not protected under the right to privacy  On May 20  1996  the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Romer v  Evans against an amendment to the Colorado state constitution that would have prevented any city  town or county in the state from taking any legislative  executive  or judicial action to protect homosexual or bisexual citizens from discrimination on the basis of their sexual orientation  On March 4  1998  the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Oncale v  Sundowner Offshore Services that federal laws banning on the job sexual harassment also applied when both parties are the same sex  The lower courts  however  have reached differing conclusions about whether this ruling applies to harassment motivated by anti gay animus  On June 28  2000  the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the Boy Scouts of America had a First Amendment right to exclude people from its organization on the basis of sexual orientation  irrespective of any applicable civil rights laws  On June 26  2003  the United States Supreme Court ruled in Lawrence v  Texas that laws against sodomy or anal sex cannot be directed at homosexuals alone  and furthermore  that intimate consensual sexual conduct is part of the liberty protected by substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment  The majority opinion  written by Justice Anthony Kennedy  explicitly overruled Bowers v  Hardwick  45  Despite this ruling  some states have kept their existing sodomy laws on the books  46  and local police have sometimes used these statutes to harass or arrest gay people  even though charges are later dropped  47  48  49   edit  Opposition The main opponents of gay rights in the U S  have generally been political and religious conservatives  Conservative Christians cite various Bible passages from the Old and New Testaments as their justification for opposing gay rights  50  Regionally  opposition to the gay rights movement has been strongest in the South and in other states with a large rural population  As the movement for same sex marriage has developed  many national and or international organizations have opposed that movement  Those organizations include the American Family Association  the Christian Coalition  Family Research Council  Focus on the Family  Save Our Children  NARTH  the national Republican Party  51  the Roman Catholic Church  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints  LDS Church   52  the Southern Baptist Convention  53 Alliance for Marriage  Alliance Defense Fund  Liberty Counsel  Westboro Baptist Church  and the National Organization for Marriage  A number of these groups have been named as anti gay hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center  54   edit  U S  political parties Among the two major parties  the Democratic Party has endorsed some gay rights legislation in its national party platform since the 1980s  The Republican Party has close ties to the Christian right and thus tends to oppose gay rights legislation  as does its national party platform  However  there are some variations among individual politicians  i e   a Democrat in a more rural district is less likely to support gay rights  while a Republican in a more urban district may be more likely to support gay rights  For example  former senator Barry Goldwater  a conservative Republican  had expressed strong support for gay rights  55  he said gays should be allowed in the military  etc  56  Similarly  Rudy Giuliani  also a noted Republican  does support civil unions 57  58  and other forms of gay rights  Post vice presidency  Dick Cheney who is a conservative has come out in support of same sex marriage  as his daughter Mary Cheney is openly gay  On the other hand  President Barack Obama  a Democrat  supports civil unions while opposing same sex marriage  59  The former chairman of the Democratic Party and former governor of Virginia Tim Kaine banned same sex marriage in Virginia and supported a law that only a married couple could adopt children  On November 15  1989  Democratic Massachusetts Governor Dukakis signed the Gay Rights Bill into law  Massachusetts became the second state  after Wisconsin  to pass such a bill  Today  active minor political parties have wide ranging views on gay rights  The Libertarian Party has endorsed libertarian perspectives on LGBT rights since it was created in 1971  and the Green Party also has endorsed gay rights since it was created in the 1980s  While many American socialist and communist political parties initially preferred to ignore the issue  most support gay rights causes  The Socialist Party USA was the first party to nominate an openly gay man  David McReynolds  as its Presidential candidate in 1980  The Constitution Party strongly opposes gay rights and is tied to Christian Reconstructionism   edit  See also LGBT portal United States portal Civil union in the United States Domestic partnership in the
