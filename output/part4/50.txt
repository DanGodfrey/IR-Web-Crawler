time of publication  Similarly  this article only reflects the team roster for the X Men team whose home is this publication  Professor X is the Headmaster of Xavier s School for Gifted Youngsters and mentor to the X Men  but he is rarely  if ever  a member of the X Men team  In his role as mentor he has typically been present in the book  but he has notable absences including issues  43 64  believed dead  preparing for Z Nox    200 273  with Lilandra Neramani in Shi ar space  replaced as Headmaster by Magneto during most of this absence    340 351  in government custody after the

was a retcon that was only revealed years later  At many times the team roster has been the same as that appearing in X Men  vol  2   and during two periods the two books have even been treated by their writer as a single bi weekly title  issues  289 350 by Scott Lobdell and issues  366 380 by Alan Davis   During issues  370 372 Wolverine was replaced by a Skrull infiltrator  leading to  The Shattering   The Twelve  storylines  and the Astonishing X Men  vol  2  limited series  After moving to San Francisco  many other mutants continually appear as background characters or allies  but apart from during crossovers they are rarely considered part of the team roster  Mutants featured include former X Men such as Iceman and Hepzibah  New X Men students such as Rockslide  Surge  and Hellion  Cannonball s New Mutants squad  and other mutants such as Toad  Frenzy  Diamond Lil  and Meld  After the book was relaunched as Uncanny X Men  1  it started to feature Cyclops s  X Tinction Team   composed of himself  Emma Frost  Namor  Magneto  Storm  Hope Summers  Colossus  Danger and Magik  However  due to Emma s injuries in the first three issues  she was temporarily replaced by Psylocke  who currently works as a reserve team member for the X Tinction Team   edit  Contributors  edit  Writers Years Writer Notes 1963 1966 Stan Lee Issues  1 19  Also series co creator  1966 1968
