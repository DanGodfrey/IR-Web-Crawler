Timeline of United States inventions  before 1890  From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search To view U S  inventions from other historical time periods  please see Timeline of United States inventions  1890 1945   Timeline of United States inventions  1946 1991   and Timeline of United States inventions  after 1991   Eli Whitney  1765 1824  is best known for inventing the cotton gin in October 1793 and patenting it on March 14  1794  1  a key invention of the Industrial Revolution that shaped the economy of the antebellum South  2  Science and technology in the United States African American contributions Discoveries NASA spinoff Native American contributions Puerto Rican scientists and inventors Technological and industrial history Inventions by date  before 1890   1890 1945   1946 1991   after 1991  A timeline of United States inventions  before 1890  encompasses the ingenuity and innovative advancements of the United States within a historical context  dating from the Colonial Period to the Gilded Age  which have been achieved by inventors who are either native born or naturalized citizens of the United States  Copyright protection secures a person s right to his or her first to invent claim of the original invention in question  highlighted in Article I  Section 8  Clause 8 of the United States Constitution which gives the following enumerated power to the United States Congress    To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts  by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries    In 1641  the first patent in North America was issued to Samuel Winslow by the General Court of Massachusetts for a new method of making salt  3  4  5  On April 10  1790  President George Washington signed the Patent Act of 1790  1 Stat  109  into law which proclaimed that patents were to be authorized for  any useful art  manufacture  engine  machine  or device  or any improvement therein not before known or used   6  On July 31  1790  Samuel Hopkins of Pittsford  Vermont became the first person in the United States to file and to be granted a patent for an improved method of  Making Pot and Pearl Ashes   7  The Patent Act of 1836  Ch  357  5 Stat  117  further clarified United States patent law to the extent of establishing a patent office where patent applications are filed  processed  and granted  contingent upon the language and scope of the claimant s invention  for a patent term of 14 years with an extension of up to an additional 7 years  6  However  the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994  URAA  changed the patent term in the United States to a total of 20 years  effective for patent applications filed on or after June 8  1995  thus bringing United States patent law further into conformity with international patent law  8  The modern day provisions of the law applied to inventions are laid out in Title 35 of the United States Code  Ch  950  sec  1  66 Stat  792   From 1836 to 2011  the United States Patent and Trademark Office  USPTO  has granted a total of 7 861 317 patents 9  relating to several well known inventions appearing throughout the timeline below  Some examples of patented inventions before 1890 include Walter Hunt s safety pin  1849   10 Thomas Edison s phonograph  1877   11 Hiram Maxim s machine gun  1884   12  and Nikola Tesla s alternating current motor  1888   13  Contents 1 Colonial Period  1500s 1775  2 Independence and the Federalist Era  1776 1801  3 Manifest Destiny  1802 1860  4 Civil War

swimfins  fins  or flippers  are blade shaped extensions worn on feet or hands for use in water  They aid movement in aquatic sports such as swimming  surfing  and underwater diving  Swim fins are typically made of rubber or plastic  Benjamin Franklin invented wooden swim fins in 1717  14  His original design consisted of 10 inch long  250 mm  and 6 inch wide  150 mm  palettes  Contrary to today s version of rubberized swim fins worn on the feet  Franklin s swim fins were originally intended for use on a person s hands  Shaped like lily pads or an artist s paint palette  they helped attain greater speed with each stroke  15  Franklin has since been posthumously honored by being inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame  16  1731 Octant An example of an octant An octant  also called reflecting quadrant  is a measuring instrument used primarily in navigation  It is a type of reflecting instrument that uses mirrors to reflect the path of light to the observer and  in doing so  doubles the angle measured  This allows the instrument to use a one eighth circle arc to measure a quarter circle or quadrant  The octant was invented in 1731 by Thomas Godfrey  a glazier in Philadelphia  and independently at the same time in England by John Hadley  who began work on a similar version of the octant  Both men have an equal and legitimate claim to the invention of the octant  Originally this instrument was referred to as  Hadley s quadrant   after the English inventor  These days it is now known as an octant  the name given to it by its American inventor  Thomas Godfrey  17  1742 Franklin stove The Franklin Stove  also known as the circulating stove  is a metal lined fireplace with baffles in the rear to improve the airflow  providing more heat and less smoke than an ordinary open fireplace  The stove became very popular throughout the Thirteen Colonies and gradually replaced open fireplaces  The Franklin stove was invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1742  18  1744 Mail order A mail order catalog is a publication containing a list of general merchandise from a company  Those who publish and operate mail order catalogs are referred to as catalogers within the industry  who also buy or manufacture goods and then market those goods to prospective customers  Mail ordering uses the postal system for soliciting and delivering goods  According to The National Mail Order Association  Benjamin Franklin invented and conceptualized mail order cataloging in 1744  19  1749 Lightning rod A lightning rod is one component in a lightning protection system  In addition to rods placed at regular intervals on the highest portions of a structure  a lightning protection system typically includes a rooftop network of conductors  multiple conductive paths from the roof to the ground  bonding connections to metallic objects within the structure and a grounding network  Individual lightning rods are sometimes called finials  air terminals or strike termination devices  In 1749 20  or 1750  15  the pointed lightning rod conductor  also called a  lightning attractor  or  Franklin rod   is generally thought to have been conceived when Benjamin Franklin came to the conclusion that electricity and lightning were identical and of the same  20  By building lightning rods originally intended to be adorned atop church steeples  Franklin set about trying to prove their usefulness of shielding people and buildings from lightning  By 1752  Dr  Franklin tied the string of his  electrical kite  to an insulating silk ribbon for the knuckles of his hand  The kite in turn was attached to a metal key  During a storm  witnessed by his son William Franklin  Dr  Franklin had finally proven that lightning was a form of electricity when the metal key received an electrical charge from a bolt of lightning  Thus  the practical use of lightning rods  attributed to the inventor Benjamin Franklin  was confirmed  21  1752 Flexible urinary catheter In medicine  a catheter is a tube that can be inserted into a body cavity  duct  or vessel  Catheters thereby allow drainage  injection of fluids  or access by surgical instruments  Prior to the mid 18th century  catheters were made of wood or stiffened animal skins which were not conducive to navigating the anatomical curvature of the human urethra  Extending his inventiveness to his family s medical problems  Benjamin Franklin invented the flexible catheter in 1752 when his brother John suffered from bladder stones  Dr  Franklin s flexible catheter was made of metal with segments hinged together in order for a wire enclosed inside to increase rigidity during insertion  14  22  23  24  1761 Armonica Also known as the glass harmonica or glass armonica  Benjamin Franklin invented a musical instrument in 1761  an arrangement of glasses after seeing water filled wine glasses played by Edmund Delaval in Cambridge  England  Dr  Franklin  who called his invention the  armonica  after the Italian word for harmony  worked with London glassblower Charles James to build one  and it had its world premi re in early 1762  played by Marianne Davies  In this version  37 bowls were mounted horizontally nested on an iron spindle  The whole spindle turned by means of a foot operated treadle  The sound was produced by touching the rims of the bowls with moistened fingers  Rims were painted different colors according to the pitch of the note  25   edit  Independence and the Federalist Era  1776 1801  1776 Swivel chair A swivel or revolving chair is a chair with a single central leg that allows the seat to spin around  Swivel chairs can have wheels on the base allowing the user to move the chair around their work area without getting up  This type is common in modern offices and is often also referred to as office chairs  Using an English style Windsor chair of which was possibly made and purchased from Francis Trumble or Philadelphia cabinet maker Benjamin Randolph  Thomas Jefferson invented the swivel chair in 1776  26  Jefferson heavily modified the Windsor chair and incorporated top and bottom parts connected by a central iron spindle  enabling the top half known as the seat  to swivel on casters of the type used in rope hung windows  When the Second Continental Congress convened in Philadelphia  Jefferson s swivel chair is purported to be where he drafted the United States Declaration of Independence  Jefferson later had the swivel chair sent to his Virginia plantation  Monticello  where he later built a  writing paddle  onto its side in 1791  Since 1836  the chair has been in the possession of the American Philosophical Society located in Philadelphia  27  1782 Flatboat A flatboat is a rectangular boat with a flat bottom and square ends generally used for freight and passengers on inland waterways  After serving in the Pennsylvania Line during the American Revolutionary War  Jacob Yoder invented and built a large boat at the Redstone Old Fort on the Monongahela River  which he freighted with flour and carried to New Orleans in May  1782  This was the first attempt to navigate the Ohio and Mississippi rivers for commercial purposes  28  29  1784 Bifocals Bifocals can provide a magnification factor of 10x to read text Bifocals are eyeglasses whose corrective lenses contain regions with two distinct optical powers  Benjamin Franklin is credited with the invention of the first pair of bifocals in the early 1760s  though according to the Library Company of Philadelphia  the first indication of Dr  Franklin wearing his double spectacles comes from a political cartoon printed in 1764  Many publications from that period onward refer to Dr  Franklin s double spectacles  including his first reference to them in a letter written in Paris  France on August 21  1784 that was addressed to his personal friend  English philanthropist George Whatley  30  31  1785 Artificial diffraction grating In optics  a diffraction grating is an optical component with a regular pattern  which diffracts light into several beams  The first man made diffraction grating was invented around 1785 in Philadelphia by David Rittenhouse who strung 50 hairs between two finely threaded screws with an approximate spacing of about 100 lines per inch  32  1787 Automatic flour mill Classical mill designs were generally powered by water or air  In water powered mills  a sluice gate opens a channel  starts the water flowing  and a water wheel turning  In 1787  American inventor Oliver Evans revolutionized this labor intensive process by building the first fully automatic mill using bucket elevators  screw conveyors  and the hopper boy to spread  cool  and dry the meal between grinding and bolting  This was the first time that anyone had conceived and executed a system of continuous  fully automatic production  29  33  1792 Cracker A cracker is a type of biscuit that developed from military hardtack and nautical ship biscuits  Crackers are now usually eaten with soup  or topped with cheese  caviar  or other delicacies  The holes in crackers are called  docking  holes as a means to stop air pockets from forming in the cracker while baking  Crackers trace their origin to the year 1792 when John Pearson of Newburyport  Massachusetts invented a cracker like bread product from just flour and water that he called  pilot bread   An immediate success with sailors because of its shelf life  it also became distinctly known as a hardtack or sea biscuit for long voyages away from home while at sea  34  1793 Cotton gin The cotton gin is a machine that separates cotton fibers from seedpods and sometimes sticky seeds  a job previously done by hand  These seeds are either used again to grow more cotton or  if badly damaged  disposed of  The cotton gin uses a combination of a wire screen and small wire hooks to pull the cotton through the screen  while brushes continuously remove the loose cotton lint to prevent jams  In 1793  Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin and later received a patent on March 14  1794  35  Whitney s cotton gin could have possibly ignited a revolution in the cotton industry and the rise of  King Cotton  as the main cash crop in the South  However  it never made him rich  Instead of buying his machine  farmers built inferior versions of their own which led to the increasing need for African American slave labor  36  1795 Wheel cypher Jefferson s disk The Jefferson disk  or wheel cypher  is a cipher system for encrypting messages and used as a deterrent for codebreaking  Using 26 wheels  each with the letters of the alphabet arranged randomly around them  Thomas Jefferson invented the wheel cypher in 1795  Falling in and out of use and obscurity  the wheel cypher was  re invented  twice  first by a French government official around 1890  and then just prior to World War I by an officer in the United States Army  Designated as M 94  the latter version was used by the United States Army and other military services from 1922 to the beginning of World War II  37  1796 Rumford fireplace The Rumford fireplace created a sensation in 1796 when Benjamin Thompson Rumford introduced the idea of restricting the chimney opening to increase the updraught  Rumford fireplaces were common from 1796  when Benjamin Rumford first wrote about them  until about 1850  Thomas Jefferson had them built at Monticello  and Henry David Thoreau listed them among the modern conveniences that everyone took for granted  Rumford and his workers changed fireplaces by inserting bricks into the hearth to make the side walls angled and added a choke to the chimney to increase the speed of air going up the flue  It produced a streamlined air flow  reducing turbulence so the smoke would go up into the chimney rather than choking the residents  Rumford fireplaces are appreciated for their tall classic elegance and heating efficiency  This simple alteration in the design of fireplaces were copied everywhere in an age when fires were the principal source of heat  The Rumford fireplace is still used in the 21st century  38  1796 Cupcake Two cupcakes iced with the Wikipedia logo on their tops A cupcake  fairy cake  patty cake or cup cake is a small cake designed to serve one person  frequently baked in a small  thin paper or aluminum cup  As with larger cakes  frosting and other cake decorations  such as sprinkles  are common on cupcakes  The earliest reference of cupcakes can be traced as far back as 1796  when a recipe notation of  a cake to be baked in small cups  was written in American Cookery by Amelia Simms  39  However  the first mentioning of the term cupcake was in  Seventy five Receipts for Pastry  Cakes  and Sweetmeats  in 1828 in Eliza Leslie s Receipts cookbook  40  1801 Suspension bridge A suspension bridge is a type of bridge in which the deck  the load bearing portion  is hung below suspension cables on vertical suspenders that carry the weight of the deck below  upon which traffic crosses  Primitive in their earliest form  the ancestor to what is now considered a suspension bridge  the simple suspension bridge  was developed sometime around 2000 B C  in China and India  relying upon ropes thrown across a narrow gorge or river  from which people could hang as they crawled across  With the extreme dangers of swinging back and forth  these simple suspension bridges were deemed impractical as horses as well as carriages later found it difficult to maneuver across their wooden planks  41  The world s first suspension bridge in a modern sense  the Jacob s Creek Bridge at approximately 70 feet in length  was invented by James Finley of Uniontown  Pennsylvania in 1801  42  who designed vertical towers to elevate the curved iron cables and to stiffen trusses in order to make the deck of bridges architecturally sound for passing travelers  Nowadays  suspension bridges use steel cables  However  the suspension bridge and its basic  fundamental design of which Finley is duly accredited to inventing  is still evident today in suspension bridges found throughout the world  43  1801 Fire hydrant A fire hydrant is an active fire protection measure  and a source of water provided in most urban  suburban and rural areas with municipal water service to enable firefighters to tap into the municipal water supply to assist in extinguishing a fire  Before the existence of fire hydrants  a primitive fire suppression system known as  fire plugs  consisted of burying a wooden water pipe  often no more than a hollowed out log  along the streets for teams of bucket brigades to form and fight fires  Wooden pegs would then need to be hammerred over fire plugs in order to stop the flow of water  44  The invention of a post or pillar type fire hydrant is generally credited to Frederick Graff Sr   Chief Engineer of the Philadelphia Water Works around the year 1801  29  It had a combination hose faucet outlet and was of  wet barrel  design with the valve in the top  It is said that Graff held the first patent for a fire hydrant  but this cannot be verified due to the fact that the patent office in Washington D C  was burned to the ground in 1836 where all patent records from that time period were destroyed in the process  45  In 1863  Birdsill Holly invented the modern version of the fire hydrant  While Holly was only one of many involved in the development of the fire hydrant  innovations he introduced are largely responsible for the fire hydrant taken for granted today  In 1869  Holly was issued U S  patent  94749  for an  improved fire hydrant   44   edit  Manifest Destiny  1802 1860  1804 Burr Truss The Burr Arch Truss  Burr Truss  or the Burr Arch  is a combination of an arch and a multiple kingpost truss design typically implemented in the construction of covered bridges  The design principle behind the Burr arch truss was that the arch should be capable of holding the entire load on the bridge while the truss was used to keep the bridge rigid  In 1804  American architect Theodore Burr  a cousin of then Vice President of the United States  Aaron Burr  designed and built the first Burr Truss on a bridge over the Hudson River in Watertown  New York  46  1805 Vapor compression refrigeration Schematic of Gorrie s 1841 ice machine Refrigeration is the process of removing heat from an enclosed space  or from a substance  and moving it to a place where it is unobjectionable  The primary purpose of refrigeration is lowering the temperature of the enclosed space or substance and then maintaining that lower temperature  The American inventor Oliver Evans  acclaimed as the  father of refrigeration   invented the vapor compression refrigeration machine in 1805  Heat would be removed from the environment by recycling vaporized refrigerant  where it would move through a compressor and condenser  where it would eventually revert back to a liquid form in order to repeat the refrigeration process over again  However  no such refrigeration unit was built by Evans  47  In 1834  Jacob Perkins modified Evans  original design  building the world s first refrigerator and filing the first legal patent for refrigeration using vapor compression  48 John Gorrie  an American doctor from Florida  invented the first mechanical refrigeration unit in 1841  based on Evans  original invention to make ice in order to cool the air for yellow fever patients  Gorrie s mechanical refrigeration unit was issued a patent in 1851  49  American professor Alexander C  Twining of Cleveland  Ohio patented an early vapor compression refrigerator in 1853 that was fully capable of producing a ton of ice per day  50  In 1913  refrigerators for home and domestic use were invented by Fred W  Wolf of Fort Wayne  Indiana with models consisting of a unit that was mounted on top of an ice box  51  A self contained refrigerator  with a compressor on the bottom of the cabinet was invented by Alfred Mellowes in 1916  Mellowes produced this refrigerator commercially but was bought out by William C  Durant in 1918  who started the Frigidaire Company in order to begin the first mass production of refrigerators  52  1805 Amphibious vehicle The Oruktor Amphibolos An amphibious vehicle is one which can be used on land or water  The self propelled variant was invented by Oliver Evans who named it the  Orukter Amphibolos   Its steam powered engine drove either wooden wheels or a paddle wheel used as a means of transport  on land and in water  Evans demonstrated his machine in Philadelphia s Center Square in 1805  built on commission from the Philadelphia Board of Health  53  Evans  steam engine differed fundamentally from later models  operating at a high pressure  25 or 30 pounds  Many years later  Evans  invention would be sold off for parts  On July 16  2005  Philadelphia celebrated the 200th anniversary of Oliver Evans s Orukter Amphibolos  Many historians describe Oliver Evans  invention as the United States  first land and water transporter  54  1806 Coffee percolator A coffee percolator is a type of pot used to brew coffee  In the case of coffee brewing the solvent is water  the permeable substance is the coffee grounds  and the soluble constituents are the chemical compounds that give coffee its color  taste  and aroma  In 1806  Benjamin Thompson Rumford invented the percolating coffee pot with a metal sieve to strain away the grounds  29  55  1808 Lobster trap An example of a lobster trap used in Devon  England A lobster trap is a portable trap which traps crustaceans such as lobsters or crayfish and is used in the industry of lobster fishing  A lobster trap can catch multiple lobsters at once  The lobster trap was invented in 1808 by Ebenezer Thorndike of Swampscott  Massachusetts  29  56  1812 Columbiad The Columbiad was a large caliber  smoothbore  muzzle loading cannon able to fire heavy projectiles at both high and low trajectories  This feature enabled the columbiad to fire solid shot or shell to long ranges  making it an excellent seacoast defense weapon for its day  Used as an artillery piece during the War of 1812 by the United States against the British  the Columbiad was invented around the year 1812 by George Bomford  a colonel in the United States Army  57  1813 Circular saw The circular saw is a metal disc or blade with saw teeth on the edge as well as the machine that causes the disk to spin  It may cut wood or other materials and may be hand held or table mounted  Tabitha Babbitt is credited with inventing the first circular saw used in a saw mill in 1813  29  58  1815 Dental floss Dental floss is either a bundle of thin nylon filaments or a plastic ribbon used to remove food and dental plaque from teeth  Levi Spear Parmly  a dentist from New Orleans  is credited with inventing the first form of dental floss  He had been recommending that people should clean their teeth with silk floss since 1815  29  59  1816 Milling machine A milling machine is a machine tool used for the shaping of metal and other solid materials  In contrast to drilling  where the drill is moved exclusively along its axis  the milling operation uses movement of the rotating cutter sideways as well as  in and out   Simeon North is generally credited for inventing and building the earliest  though primitive  milling machine to replace filing operations by about 1816 or even earlier  60  1818 Profile lathe A lathe is an adjustable horizontal metal rail and a tool rest  between the material and the operator which accommodates the positioning of shaping tools  With wood  it is common practice to press and slide sandpaper against the still spinning object after shaping it to smooth the surface  As the first of its kind  Thomas Blanchard of Middlebury  Connecticut  invented the profile lathe in 1818  intended for the mass duplication of woodworking  61  1827 Detachable collar A detachable collar is a collar separate from the shirt  fastened to the shirt by studs  Hannah Lord Montague invented the detachable collar in Troy  New York in 1827  after she snipped the collar off one of her husband s shirts to wash it  and then sewed it back on  62  1829 Graham cracker A stack of graham crackers A graham cracker is cookie or digestive biscuit made with graham flour  a combination of fine ground white flour and coarse ground wheat bran and germ  Graham crackers are often used for making s mores and pie crusts  Graham bread was invented by a Presbyterian minister  Reverend Sylvester Graham in 1829  for his vegetarian diet  The Graham bread was high in fiber  made with non sifted whole wheat flour and cut into little squares now known as graham crackers  63  1830 Platform scale Also known as the Fairbanks Scale  the platform scale is a benched scale for measuring the counter balance weight of loaded objects at ground level  thus eliminating the use of a hoist  After a series of trial and error in his designs  Thaddeus Fairbanks patented his invention in 1830  E  amp  T Fairbanks  amp  Company  a business partnership between Thaddeus and his brother  Erastus Fairbanks  exported their famous scales around the world to exotic locations such as England  China  Cuba  Russia  and India due to the high demand  64  1831 Flanged T rail The flanged T rail is an all iron railway rail that has a flat bottom and requires no chair to hold the rails upright  The flanged  tee  rail was invented in May 1831 by an American named Robert L  Stevens of the Camden  amp  Amboy Railroad and Transportation Company  which he conceived while crossing the Atlantic en route to buy an English locomotive  The first 500 T rails were installed in Philadelphia  They would go on to be employed by railroads across the United States and are still seen today  65  1831 Multiple coil magnet A multiple coil magnet is an electromagnet that has several coils of wire connected in parallel  This increases the total electric current in the electromagnet and therefore generates a stronger magnetic field  It was invented by American scientist Joseph Henry in 1831  66  1831 Doorbell  electric  A doorbell is a signaling device commonly found near a door  It commonly emits a ringing sound to alert the occupant of the building to a visitor s presence  The electric doorbell was invented by Joseph Henry in 1831  29  67  1832 Morse code A typical  straight key  model used for transmitting and transcribing Morse code Morse code is a type of character encoding that transmits telegraphic information using rhythm  Morse code uses a standardized sequence of short and long elements to represent the letters  numerals  punctuation  and special characters of a given message  After many years of development  an electrical telegraph came to exclusively refer to a signaling telegram  as an operator makes and breaks an electrical contact with a telegraph key  resulting in an audible signal at the other end produced by a telegraph sounder which is interpreted and transcribed by an operator  The short and long elements are formed by sounds  marks  or pulses  in on off keying and are commonly known as  dots  and  dashes  or  dits  and  dahs   In 1832  Alfred Vail in collaboration with Samuel Morse  began the process of co inventing the Morse code signalling alphabet  68  After a few minor changes  including the development of International Morse code which is distinct from the original encoding system  American Morse code  Morse code was standardized in 1865 by the International Telegraphy Congress in Paris  France and later made the norm by the International Telecommunication Union  After 160 years of continuous use  international regulations beginning on January 31  1999  no longer required ships at sea to call for help in an emergency using Morse code or the famous SOS signal  69  1833 Sewing machine  lock stitch  Most modern sewing machines use the lockstitch technique of sewing invented by Walter Hunt  which consists of two threads  an upper and a lower  The upper thread runs from a spool kept on a spindle on top of or next to the machine  through a tension mechanism  a take up arm  and finally through the hole in the needle  The lower thread is wound onto a bobbin  which is inserted into a case in the lower section of the machine  Walter Hunt invented the first lock stitch sewing machine in 1833  Hunt lost interest and did not patent his invention  70  In 1846  Elias Howe secured a patent on an original lock stitch machine  and failed to manufacture and market it  Isaac Singer infringed on Howe s patent to make his own machine  making him wealthy  Elias Howe filed a lawsuit  alleging patent infringement  On July 1  1854  a federal commission ruled in favor of Howe  ordering Isaac Singer as well as all sewing machine makers to pay Elias Howe royalties  71  1834 Combine harvester A John Deere combine harvesting corn The combine harvester  or combine  or thresher  is a machine that combines the tasks of harvesting  threshing  and cleaning grain crops  The objective is to complete these three processes  which used to be distinct  in one pass of the machine over a particular part of the field  The waste straw left behind on the field is the remaining dried stems and leaves of the crop with limited nutrients which is either chopped or spread on the field  or baled for livestock feed  The first combine harvester was invented by Hiram Moore in 1834  72  1835 Steam shovel A steam shovel is a large steam powered excavating machine designed for lifting and moving material such as rock and soil  typically in the mining industry  The steam shovel is composed of a bucket  boom and  dipper stick   boiler  water tank and coal bunker  a steam engine  and a winch  The steam shovel was invented in 1835 by William Otis  later receiving a patent for his invention on February 24  1839  73  1835 Wrench The wrench or spanner is a tool used to provide a mechanical advantage in applying torque to turn bolts  nuts or other items designed to interface with a wrench  The first wrench was patented in 1835 by Solymon Merrick  74  who was issued U S  patent  38 on May 7  1842  75  1835 Solar compass William Austin Burt s solar compass A solar compass is a railroad compass with a solar attachment that allows surveyors to determine the north direction by reference to the sun rather than by reference to the magnetic needle  It consists of three arcs  one for setting the latitude of the land to be surveyed  one for setting the declination of the sun  and one for setting the hour of the day  In 1835  the solar compass was invented by William Austin Burt  a U S  Deputy Surveyor who began surveying government lands in the Michigan Territory earlier in 1833  While experiecing great difficulty in using his standard vernier compass in order to detect deposits of iron ore in the Northwest Territory  present day Wisconsin   Burt devised the solar compass so that garbled readings of the Earth s magnetic field and north south survey lines would be easier to find  76  77  A patent was issued to Burt on February 25  1836  78  1835 Relay A relay is an electrical switch that opens and closes under the control of another electrical circuit  In the original form  the switch is operated by an electromagnet to open or close one or many sets of contacts  The relay was invented by the renowned American scientist  Joseph Henry in 1835  79  1836 Gridiron  cooking  A gridiron is a metal grate with parallel bars typically used for grilling meat  fish  vegetables  or combinations of such foods  It may also be two such grids  hinged to fold together  to securely hold food while grilling over an open flame  Gridironing is often performed outdoors  using charcoal  real wood or preformed briquettes   wood  or propane gas  The earliest gridiron was a combination hinged gridiron and spider co invented in 1836 by Amasa and George Sizer of Meriden  Connecticut  80  U S  Patent  78 was issued to them jointly on November 14  1836  81  The next advancement in the gridiron was a steel wire one was invented and patented in 1889 in New Haven  Connecticut  by William C  Perkins  of the New Haven Wire Goods Company  who received U S  Patent  408 136 on July 30  1889 for a hinged gridiron that would hold the meat in place while broiling  82  1836 Circuit breaker 400 kV SF6 live tank circuit breakers A circuit breaker is an automatically operated electrical switch designed to protect an electrical circuit from damage caused by overload or short circuit  Its basic function is to detect a fault condition and  by interrupting continuity  to immediately discontinue electrical flow  Unlike a fuse  which operates once and then has to be replaced  a circuit breaker can be reset  either manually or automatically  to resume normal operation  Circuit breakers are made in varying sizes  from small devices that protect an individual household appliance up to large switchgear designed to protect high voltage circuits feeding an entire city  Inspired by the works of American scientist Joseph Henry and English scientist Michael Faraday  the circuit breaker was invented by an American  Charles Grafton Page  83  1837 Self polishing cast steel plow The plow is a tool used in farming for initial cultivation of soil in preparation for sowing seed or planting  It has been a basic instrument for most of recorded history  and represents one of the major advances in agriculture  In modern use  a plowed field is typically left to dry out  and is harrowed before planting  An American agricultural pioneer named John Deere modernized the plow by shaping steel from an old sawmill blade and joining it to a wrought iron moldboard  Deere polished both parts smooth so the damp soil would no longer stick  After patenting the device in 1837  it became an instant success and a necessity on American farms  84  1839 Corn sheller A corn sheller or maize sheller  is a machine used to shell or shuck ears of sweet corn of their silk  By feeding ears of sweet corn into a concentric cylindrical rest  they are parallel to the axis of the shelling cylinder in a hopper fixed on one side of the machine  As the cylindrical rest revolves  an ear falls into each space between staves  and is kept in contact with the shelling cylinder by the pressure of the segment concave  The grain shelled falls beneath the machine and the ear of sweet corn is delivered at the side opposite to the hopper  after having been in contact with the cylinder during approximately four or five revolutions  The corn sheller was invented by Lester E  Denison of Sayville  Connecticut who received a patent on August 12  1839  85  1839 Sleeping car The sleeping car or sleeper is a railroad passenger car that can accommodate passengers in beds  primarily to make nighttime travel more restful  The first such cars saw sporadic use on American railroads in the 1830s and could be configured for coach seating during the day  The pioneer of this new mode of traveling transcontinental was the Cumberland Valley Railroad which introduced service of the first sleeping car in the spring of 1939  The sleeping car did not become commercially practical until 1857 when George Pullman invented the Pullman sleeping car  86  1839 Vulcanized rubber Vulcanization refers to a specific curing process of rubber involving high heat and the addition of sulfur or other equivalent curatives  It is a chemical process in which polymer molecules are linked to other polymer molecules by atomic bridges composed of sulfur atoms or carbon to carbon bonds  A vast array of products are made with vulcanized rubber including ice hockey pucks  tires  shoe soles  hoses and many more  When  rubber fever  struck Boston in the 1830s  there was a large consumer demand for products made of rubber  aprons  life preservers  hats  carriage tops  and  by 1836  waterproof shoes  But in the heat of summer  rubber goods turned into a gooey  foul smelling mess  in the winter  they froze stiff  In 1839  Charles Goodyear had a breakthrough when he mixed liquid latex with sulfur and heating it in the sun or over a stove top  The leather like form of the stretchable substance resulted in the first vulcanized rubber  Goodyear received a patent on June 15  1844  87  1839 Babbitt  metal  Babbitt  also called Babbitt metal or bearing metal  is any of several alloys characterized by its resistance to galling  Babbitt is most commonly used as a thin surface layer in a complex  multi metal structure  but its original use was as a cast in place bulk bearing material  Babbitt metal was invented in 1839 for use in steam engines by American goldsmith Isaac Babbitt in Taunton  Massachusetts  88  1840 Howe truss A Howe truss is a specialized design of a trussed bridge whereby the vertical trusses are in tension and the diagonal trusses are compressed  Howe trusses slope upwards and towards the center of the bridge  The Howe truss was patented in 1840 by William Howe  89  1842 Anesthesia  ether  Crawford Long  of Jefferson  Georgia  performed the first operation using his development of ether based anesthesia  when he removed a tumor from the neck of Mr  James Venable  Long did not reveal the practicality of using ether anesthesia until 1849  90  1842 Grain elevator Grain elevators are buildings or complexes of buildings for storage and shipment of grain  They were invented in 1842 in Buffalo  New York  by Joseph Dart  who first developed a steam powered mechanism  called a marine leg  for scooping grain out of the hulls of ships directly into storage silos  91  1843 Ice cream maker  hand cranked  An early example of a hand cranked ice cream maker An ice cream maker is a machine used to make small quantities of ice cream at home  Ice cream makers may stir the mixture by hand cranking or with an electric motor  and may chill the ice cream by using a freezing mixture  by pre cooling the machine in a freezer  or by the machine itself refrigerating the mixture  An ice cream maker must freeze the mixture  and must simultaneously stir or churn it to prevent the formation of ice crystals and aerate it to produce smooth and creamy ice cream  In 1843  New England housewife Nancy Johnson invented the hand cranked ice cream churn  She patented her invention but lacked the resources to make and market the churn herself  Johnson sold the patent for  200 to a Philadelphia kitchen wholesaler who  by 1847  made enough ice cream makers to satisfy the high demand  From 1847 to 1877  more than 70 improvements to ice cream makers were patented  92  1843 Multiple effect evaporator A multiple effect evaporator  as defined in chemical engineering  is an apparatus for efficiently using the heat from steam to evaporate water  In 1843  Norbert Rillieux invented and patented the multiple effect evaporator where its first installation and use was in a Louisiana sugar factory  93  1843 Rotary printing press A rotary printing press is a printing press in which the images to be printed are curved around a cylinder  In 1843  Richard Hoe invented a revolution in printing by rolling a cylinder over stationary plates of inked type and using the cylinder to make an impression on paper  This eliminated the need for making impressions directly from the type plates themselves  which were heavy and difficult to maneuver  94  1844 Pratt truss A Pratt truss is a specialized design of a trussed bridge whereby the vertical trusses are compressed and the diagonal trusses are in tension  Sloping downwards and towards the center of the bridge  Pratt trusses therefore create Y and K shaped patterns  As the exact opposite of the Howe truss design  the Pratt truss was co invented and co patented in 1844 by Thomas and Caleb Pratt  95  1845 Pressure sensitive tape Pressure sensitive tape  PSA tape  adhesive tape  self stick tape  or sticky tape consists of a pressure sensitive adhesive coated onto a backing material such as paper  plastic film  cloth  or metal foil  The first pressure sensitive tape took the form of surgical tape  invented by Dr  Horace Day in 1845  96  1845 Maynard tape primer The Maynard tape primer is a system designed to allow for more rapid reloading of muskets which previously relied on small copped caps that were filled with mercury fulminate  Dr  Edward Maynard  a dentist with an interest in firearms  embedded tiny pellets of priming material in thin strips of paper  then glued a second strip of paper on top of the first  creating a  tape  of primer  The tape could be manufactured quickly and cheaply  since paper was much less expensive than copper  In 1845  Edward Maynard patented his new firearm invention which in later years  would be widely used in the American Civil War  97  1845 Baseball A sketch of an early baseball game played at Elysian Fields  Hoboken  New Jersey As the United States  de facto national sport and pastime  baseball is a bat and ball sport played between two teams of nine players each  Many historians attribute baseball s origins to the English sports of stoolball and rounders as well as to the 18th and 19th century North American sports of Old Cat and Town ball  all early precursors to baseball  However  the bat and ball sports played in the United States  Europe  or elsewhere in the world prior to 1845 did not resemble the standard of modern day rules as to which baseball has continuously used ever since the mid 19th century  In 1845  Alexander Cartwright wrote the official and codified set of regulated rules of baseball formally known as the Knickerbocker Rules  Cartwright s original 14 rules were somewhat similar to but not identical to rounders  Three exceptions devised by Cartwright included the stipulations that the playing field had to be laid out in a diamond shape rather than a square used in rounders  foul territories were to be introduced for the first time  and the practice of retiring a runner by hitting him with a thrown ball was forbidden  On June 19  1846  the Knickerbocker Rules were instituted for the first time when Cartwright s New York Knickerbockers competed against the New York Nine  in what is considered by the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown  New York as  the first modern base ball game   98  With the myth of Abner Doubleday inventing baseball debunked and 46 years after his death  Cartwright in 1938  was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in the executive category  99  100  On June 3  1953  the 83rd United States Congress unanimously credited Cartwright with inventing the modern sport of baseball  99  101  1846 Transverse shuttle The transverse shuttle is a method to drive a bobbin on a sewing machine so as to create the lockstitch technique  Transverse shuttles carry the bobbin in a boat shaped shuttle  and reciprocate the shuttle along a straight horizontal shaft  As the earliest of bobbin drivers  the transverse shuttle was patented by Elias Howe on September 10  1846  102  1846 Printing telegraph The printing telegraph is a derivative of the electrical telegraph which links two 28 key piano style keyboards by electrical wire representing a letter of the alphabet and when pressed causing the corresponding letter to print at the receiving end  The receiver would then receive the instantly readable text of the message on a paper strip  This is in contrast to the electrical telegraphs that used Morse Code  dots  and  dashes  which needed to be converted into readable text  After 1850  the printing telegraph was in common use  namely along the United States east coast and in France  The printing telegraph was invented in 1846 by Royal Earl House of Rockland  Vermont  103  1847 Gas mask A gas mask from the Czech Republic A gas mask is a mask worn over the face to protect the wearer from inhaling  airborne pollutants  and toxic gasses  The mask forms a sealed cover over the nose and mouth  but may also cover the eyes and other vulnerable soft tissues of the face  The gas mask was invented in 1847 by Lewis Haslett  a device that contained elements that allowed breathing through a nose and mouthpiece  inhalation of air through a bulb shaped filter  and a vent to exhale air back into the atmosphere  104  According to First Facts  it states that the  gas mask resembling the modern type was patented by Lewis Phectic Haslett of Louisville  Kentucky who received a patent on June 12  1849   105  U S  patent  6 529 issued to Haslett  described the first  Inhaler or Lung Protector  that filtered dust from the air  29  106  1847 Doughnut  ring shaped  A doughnut or donut  is a type of fried dough food popular in many countries and prepared in various forms as a sweet  or occasionally savory  snack that can be homemade or purchased in bakeries  supermarkets  food stalls  and franchised specialty outlets  They are usually sweet  deep fried from a flour dough  and shaped in rings or flattened spheres that sometimes contain fillings  The doughnut has a long history  supposedly a Dutch creation exported to New Amsterdam  present day New York City  in the 1600s under the Dutch name of olykoeks   oily cakes   However  the ring shaped doughnut with a  hole  in the center is thought to be an American creation  supposedly invented in 1847 by Captain Hanson Gregory of Clam Cove  Maine  107  1848 Pin tumbler lock  cylindrical  The pin tumbler lock is a lock mechanism that uses pins of varying lengths to prevent the lock from opening without the correct key  Pin tumblers are most commonly employed in cylinder locks  but may also be found in tubular or radial locks  The earliest pin tumble locks were made over 4 000 years ago by the Egyptians  But due to their large  cumbersome size and since they were made of wood  the locks were not practical to use  108  In 1848  Linus Yale  Sr  invented a pin tumbler lock  109  In 1861  Linus Yale  Jr  was inspired by the original 1840s cylindrical lock designed by his father  thus inventing and patenting a smaller flat key with serrated edges as well as pins of varying lengths within the lock itself  the same design of the pin tumbler lock which still remains in use today  110  1849 Jackhammer Drilling a blast hole with a jackhammer A jackhammer  also known as a pneumatic hammer  is a portable percussive drill powered by compressed air  It is used to drill rock and break up concrete pavement  among other applications  It jabs with its bit  not rotating it  A jackhammer operates by driving an internal hammer up and down  The hammer is first driven down to strike the back of the bit and then back up to return the hammer to the original position to repeat the cycle  The bit usually recovers from the stroke by means of a spring  The earliest form of a jackhammer  a  percussion drill  was invented in 1848 and patented in 1849 by Jonathan J  Couch of Philadelphia  Pennsylvania  In this drill  the drill bit passed through the piston of a steam engine  The piston snagged the drill bit and hurled it against the rock face  It was an experimental model  111  1849 Safety pin The safety pin is a fastening device  a variation of the regular pin which includes a simple spring mechanism and a clasp  The clasp serves two purposes  to form a closed loop thereby properly fastening the pin to whatever it is applied to  and to cover the end of the pin to protect the user from the sharp point  The safety pin was invented by Walter Hunt  and patented in April 1849  The rights to the invention were sold for  400  112  1850 Dishwasher The dishwasher cleans dishes  glassware  and eating utensils  The first dishwasher was a wooden one whereby a person would turn a handle to splash water on the dishware  It was invented in 1850 by Joel Houghton of Ogden  New York  The device was a failure  113  Houghton received U S  patent  7 365 on May 14  1850  114  The first successful and practical dishwasher was invented in 1886 by Josephine Cochrane  The motorized device turned a wheel while soapy water squirted up and rained down on the dishware  113  Cochran received U S  patent  355139 for the  Dish Washing Machine  on December 28  1886  115  1850 Feed dogs Feed dogs are the critical component of a  drop feed  sewing machine  A set of feed dogs typically resembles two or three short  thin metal bars  crosscut with diagonal teeth  which move back and forth in slots in a sewing machine s needle plate  Their purpose is to pull   feed   the fabric through the machine  in discrete steps  in between stitches  Allen B  Wilson invented it during the time period 1850 to 1854  116  U S  patent  12116 was issued on December 18  1854  117  1850 Vibrating shuttle A vibrating shuttle in its carrier A vibrating shuttle is a bobbin driver design used in home lockstitch sewing machines during the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century  It supplanted the earlier transverse shuttle design invented by Elias Howe in 1846  but was itself supplanted by the rotary hook later on  American cabinetmaker Allen B  Wilson of Willet  New York invented the vibrating shuttle design in 1850  The owners of the 1848 Bradshaw patent claimed infringement by Wilson  However  it was without justication  In order to avoid a lawsuit  Wilson relinquished his interest in U S  Patent  7 776 that was issued to him on November 12  1850  A P  Kline and Edward Lee took ownership  118  1850 Inverted microscope An inverted microscope is a microscope with its light source and condenser on the top  above the stage pointing down  while the objectives and turret are below the stage pointing up  The inverted microscope was invented in 1850 by J  Lawrence Smith  a faculty member of Tulane University and the Medical College of Louisiana  29  119  1851 Rotary hook A rotary hook is a bobbin driver design used in lockstitch sewing machines of the 19th and 20th century and beyond  It triumphed over competing designs because it could run at higher speeds with less vibration  Rotary hook machines hold their bobbin stationary  and continuously rotate the thread hook around it  The rotary hook was co invented by American cabinetmaker Allen B  Wilson and Nathaniel Wheeler in 1851  120  U S  Patent   8 296 was issued to Wilson on August 12  1851  121  1851 Fire alarm box A fire alarm box is an outdoor device used for notifying a fire department of a fire  Early boxes used the telegraph system and were the main method of calling the fire department to a neighborhood in the days before people had telephones  When the box is triggered  a spring loaded wheel spins and taps out a signal onto the fire alarm telegraph wire  indicating the box number  The receiver at a fire station then can match the number to the neighborhood  The municipal fire alarm system got its start in Massachusetts  It was invented by Moses G  Farmer  an engineer  and Dr  William Channing  a Harvard educated Bostonian  Their revolutionary creation was installed in 1851 and consisted of 40 miles of wire and 45 boxes in Boston  122  1852 Elevator brake An elevator or lift is a vertical transport vehicle that efficiently moves people or goods between floors of a building  In 1852  Elisha Graves Otis invented the first safety brake for elevators which prevents an elevator from spiralling into a free fall between numerous floors inside a building  123  1853 Burglar alarm A burglar alarm contains sensors which are connected to a control unit via a low voltage hardwire or narrowband RF signal which is used to interact with a response device  The alarm was patented  U S  patent  9 802  on June 21  1853 by the Reverend Augustus Russell Pope of Somerville  Massachusetts  124  125  As the first person to commercialize Pope s invention  Edwin Holmes acquired Pope s patent rights in 1857 for US 1 500  126  1853 Potato chips Potato chips  also known as crisps in British English  are thin slices of potato that are deep fried or baked until crispy  Potato chips serve as an appetizer  side dish  or snack  The basic chips are cooked and salted  and additional varieties are manufactured using various flavorings and ingredients including seasonings  herbs  spices  cheeses  and artificial additives  The original potato chip recipe was invented by chef George Crum at Moon s Lake House near Saratoga Springs  New York  on August 24  1853  127  Fed up with a customer who continued to send his fried potatoes back complaining that they were too thick and soggy  Crum decided to slice the potatoes so thin that they could not be eaten with a fork  As they could not be fried normally in a pan  he decided to stir fry the potato slices  Against Crum s expectation  the guest was ecstatic about the new chips and they soon became a regular item on the lodge s menu  and were known as  Saratoga chips   128  1853 Clothespin A clothespin with metal lever action A clothespin is a fastener with a lever action used to hang up clothes for drying  usually on a clothes line  Clothespins often come in many different designs  This design was invented by David M  Smith of Springfield  Vermont  in 1853  129  1854 Breast pump A breast pump is a mechanical device that extracts milk from the breasts of a lactating woman  Breast pumps may be manual devices powered by hand or foot movements or electrical devices powered by mains electricity or batteries  The first breast pump was patented by O H  Needham on June 20  1854  130  1855 Calliope Also known as a steam organ or steam piano  a calliope is a musical instrument that produces sound by sending a gas  originally steam or more recently compressed air  through large whistles  originally locomotive whistles  It was often played on riverboats and in circuses  where it was sometimes mounted on a carved  painted and gilded horse drawn wagon in a circus parade  The calliope was invented in 1855 by Joshua C  Stoddard of Worcester  Massachusetts  131  U S  patent  13 668 was issued to Stoddard on October 9  1855  132  1856 Condensed milk Condensed milk is cow s milk from which water has been removed and to which sugar has been added  yielding a very thick  sweet product that can last for years without refrigeration if unopened  Gail Borden invented condensed milk in 1856 and was later used by soldiers during the American Civil War  133  1856 Equatorial sextant The equatorial sextant is a navigational instrument that is used to get an accurate bearing and position of a ship at sea  and to take azimuths  altitude  time and declination while making observations  134  Also known as an altitude Instrument  the equatoral sextant was first invented and made by William Austin Burt  He patented it on November 4  1856 in the United States as U S  patent  16 002  135  1857 Toilet paper  mass produced and rolled  Toilet paper is a soft paper product  tissue paper  used to maintain personal hygiene after human defecation or urination  However  it can also be used for other purposes such as absorbing spillages or craft projects  Toilet paper in different forms has been used for centuries  namely in China  The ancient Greeks used clay and stone  the Romans  sponges and salt water  But according to a CNN article  the idea of a commercial product designed solely to wipe a person s buttocks was by New York City entrepreneur Joseph Gayetty  who in 1857  invented aloe infused sheets of manila hemp dispensed from Kleenex like boxes  However  Gayetty s toilet paper was a failure for several reasons  Americans soon grew accustomed to wiping with the Sears Roebuck catalog  they saw no need to spend money on toilet paper when catalogs for their use came in the mail for free  and because during the 19th century  it was a social taboo to openly discuss bathroom hygiene with others  Toilet paper took its next leap forward in 1890  when two brothers named Clarence and E  Irvin Scott of the Scott Paper Company co invented rolled toilet paper  136  1857 Pink lemonade Pink lemonade is a variant of lemonade that uses artificial flavors and colors as well as natural sources of juices  such as grenadine  cherry juice  red grapefruit juice  grape juice  cranberry juice  strawberry juice  and pomegranate  to give it a  pink  coloration  The earliest reference to the invention of pink lemonade according to historian Joe Nickell  was that Pete Conklin invented the drink in 1857 when he used water dyed pink from a horse rider s red tights to make his lemonade  137  1857 Brown Truss A Brown truss is a type of bridge truss  used in covered bridges  It is noted for its economical use of materials  taking the form of a box truss  There may be vertical or almost vertical tension members  but there are no vertical members in compression  In practice  when used in a covered bridge  the most common application  the truss is protected with outside sheathing  The Brown Truss was invented and patented by Josiah Brown Jr  in 1857  138  1858 Pepper shaker A pepper shaker with a screw on cap Salt and pepper shakers are typically placed on tabletops in restaurants and in home kitchens  Used as condiment holders in Western culture  salt and pepper shakers are designed to store and dispense edible salt and ground peppercorns  The first pepper shaker with screw on cap was invented by John Landis Mason who received a patent on November 30  1858  139  1858 Mason jar In home canning  food is packed into a jar  and the steel lid is placed on top of the jar with the integral rubber seal resting on the rim of the jar  The band is screwed loosely over the lid  which will allow air and steam to escape  By far  though  the most popular form of seal was the screw on zinc cap  the precursor to today s screw on lids  The earliest glass jars were called wax sealers  because they used sealing wax  which was poured into a channel around the lip that held on a tin lid  The earliest successful application of this was discovered by John Landis Mason and patented on November 30  1858  a date embossed on millions of jars for food preservation and pickling  140  1858 Pencil eraser An eraser attached to a graphite pencil A pencil eraser is an article of stationery attached to the opposite end of a graphite pencil s sharpened tip  The eraser itself is typically made out of gum like or synthetic rubber that is used for rubbing out pencil mistakes on paper  On March 30  1858  Hymen Lipman received the first patent for the conception and the idea of attaching an eraser to the end of a pencil  141  In 1862 Lipman sold his patent to Joseph Reckendorfer for  100 000  who went to sue the pencil manufacturer Faber Castell for infringement  142  In 1875  the Supreme Court of the United States ruled against Reckendorfer declaring the patent invalid  143  1858 Ironing board An ironing board is a portable and foldable table with a heat resistant top used in the aid of removing wrinkles from clothing with an iron and spray starch  The first ironing board was co patented on February 16  1858 by inventors William Vandenburg and James Harvey of New York City  144  1858 Twine knotter A twine binder is a mechanical device or machine that wraps knotted twine around a bundle or sheave of grain in binded form after it has been reaped  While working at a farm in Whitewater  Wisconsin in 1857  John Appleby invented the twine knotter  Incorporating many of Jacob Behel s innovations as found in his development of the  billhook  knotter in 1864  Appleby later sold the patent around the year 1877 to William Deering who began the manufacturing and exploited the practicability of Appleby s twine knotter into a commercially profitable reaper binder  145  1858 Dustpan A dustpan is a cleaning utensil commonly used in combination with a broom  The dustpan may appear to be a type of flat scoop  The dustpan was invented and patented  U S  patent  20 811  by the American inventor T E  McNeill in 1858  146  1859 Electric stove An electric stove is a large kitchen appliance that converts electricity into heat in order to cook and bake food  In addition to heated coils atop a stovetop range  glass ceramic cooktops and induction stoves using electromagnetic induction have proven to be popular in commercial kitchens as well as for domestic use in homes  Canadian inventor Thomas Ahearn is often credited with inventing the electric cooking range in 1882  However  the first such patent for an electrical stove apparatus was awarded in the United States much earlier to George B  Simpson on September 20  1859  Simpson s patent  US patent  25532 for an  electro heater  surface heated by an platinum wire coil powered by batteries  147  is described in his own words to be useful to  warm rooms  boil water  cook victuals      148  1859 Escalator A typical escalator tube on the London Underground An escalator is a moving staircase  a conveyor transport device for carrying people between floors of a building  Commonly found and used in shopping malls  department stores  airports  an escalator consists of a motor driven chain of individual  linked steps that move up or down on tracks  allowing the step treads to remain horizontal  The escalator was invented in 1859 by Nathan Ames of Saugus  Massachusetts for an invention that he called  Revolving Stairs   29  However  Ames  escalator was never built  The earliest form of a working escalator  patented in 1892 by Jesse W  Reno  was introduced as a new novelty ride at the Old Iron Pier at Coney Island  New York in 1896  149  1860 Vacuum cleaner A vacuum cleaner uses a partial vacuum to suck up dust and dirt  usually from floors  Daniel Hess of West Union  Iowa  invented the first vacuum cleaner in 1860  Calling it a carpet sweeper instead of a vacuum cleaner  his machine did  in fact  have a rotating brush like a traditional vacuum cleaner which also possessed an elaborate bellows mechanism on top of the body to generate suction of dust and dirt  Hess received a patent  U S  patent  29 077  for his invention of the first vacuum cleaner on July 10  1860  150  151  152  Despite credit usually going to English inventor Hubert Cecil Booth for inventing the first electric vacuum cleaner in 1901  his vacuum was actually predated two years by an American  John Thurman of St  Louis  Missouri  who invented the electric vacuum cleaner in 1899  However  neither were practical or useful  The first practical and portable vacuum cleaner was built in 1907  when James Murray Spangler  a janitor from Canton  Ohio  incorporated a rotating brush  an electric fan  a box  and one of his wife s pillowcases to serve as the dust bag  153  1860 Repeating rifle  lever action  A repeating rifle is a single barreled rifle containing multiple rounds of ammunition  Benjamin Tyler Henry  chief designer for Oliver Fisher Winchester s arms company  adapted a breech loading rifle built by Walter Hunt and invented the first practical lever action repeating rifle in 1860  First known as the Henry rifle  it became famously known as the Winchester by Union soldiers in the American Civil War  154   edit  Civil War and the Reconstruction Era  1861 1877  1861 Jelly bean A handful of jelly beans Jelly beans are a small bean shaped type of confectionery with a hard candy shell and a gummy interior which come in a wide variety of flavors  The confection is primarily made of sugar  The Turkish Delight  a Middle Eastern candy made of soft jelly  covered in confectioner s powder  with roots dating to biblical days  was an early precursor to the jelly bean that inspired its gummy interior  However  it is generally thought that jelly beans first surfaced in 1861 when Boston confectioner and inventor William Schrafft urged people to send his jelly beans to soldiers during the American Civil War  It wasn t until July 5  1905 that the mentioning of jelly beans was published in the Chicago Daily News  The advertisement publicized bulk jelly beans sold by volume for nine cents per pound  according to the book   The Century in Food  America s Fads and Favorites   Today  most historians contend that in the United States  they were first linked with Easter in the 1930s  155  1861 Twist drill A twist drill is a bit with two cutted grooves in opposite sides of a round bar  whereby the twisted bar produces a helical flute in order to drill holes in metal  plastic  or wood  The twist drill was invented by Stephen A  Morse in October 1861 and later patented on April 7  1863  156  1861 Kinematoscope The kinematoscope is a device using the principles of stereoscopy in order to present the illusion of a motion picture  Viewed from inside a cabinet  the images with chronologically successive stages of action which were mounted on blades of a spinning paddle  The kinematoscope was invented by Coleman Sellers II of Philadelphia who received U S  patent  31 357 on February 5  1861  157  158  1861 Postcard A postcard or post card is a rectangular piece of material  such as paper  leather or other materials  intended for writing and mailing without an envelope   Postal card  is the term used for a post card issued by a postal authority  generally with postage prepaid  The post card was invented by John P  Charlton of Philadelphia in 1861 for which he obtained the copyright later transferred to Hymen Lipman  The cards were adorned with a small border and labeled  Lipman s Postal Card  Patent Applied For   and later  COPY RIGHT SECURED 1861   They were on the market until 1873 when the first United States issued postcards appeared  159  1861 Machine gun  hand cranked  The machine gun is typically considered to be a fully automatic firearm  usually designed to fire rifle cartridges in quick succession from an ammunition belt or large capacity magazine  The Gatling gun  invented and patented in 1861 by Richard Gatling during the American Civil War  was the earliest precursor to a machine gun in the sense that it had all of the underlying features of reliable loading as well as the ability to fire sustained multiple bursts of rounds  the only drawback being  it had to be manually operated and hand cranked unlike its 1884 successor  the Maxim gun  which was indisputably the world s first true machine gun  160  161  1863 Breakfast cereal A bowl of breakfast cereal filled with milk and topped with raspberries Breakfast cereal is a packaged food product intended to be consumed as part of a breakfast  The first breakfast cereal  Granula was invented in the United States in 1863 by James Caleb Jackson  operator of the Jackson Sanitorium in Dansville  New York  The cereal never became popular since it was inconvenient  as the heavy bran nuggets needed soaking overnight before they were tender enough to eat  162  1863 Ratchet wrench A socket wrench  more commonly referred to as a ratchet  is a type of wrench  or tightening tool  that uses separate  removable sockets to fit many different sizes of fittings and fasteners  most commonly nuts and bolts  The ratchet wrench was invented by J J  Richardson of Woodstock  Vermont  receiving a patent for the ratcher wrench from the Scientific American Patent Agency on June 18  1863  163  1863 Quad skates Quad skates are four wheeled turning roller skates set in two side by side pairs  In 1863  James Leonard Plimpton of Medford  Massachusetts  invented the first four wheeled roller skates arranged in two side by side pairs  Before Plimpton s invention  all wheels on the bottom of roller skates were inline  164  1863 Double barreled cannon The double barreled cannon prototype located in Athens  Georgia The double barreled cannon is an American Civil War era experimental weapon that was intended to fire two cannon balls connected with a chain  While originally built for warfare for the Confederacy  the cannon never saw battle  The prototype is now on display and is a modern landmark located in Athens  Georgia  In 1863  John Gilleland invented the double barreled cannon  165  1864 Spar torpedo The spar torpedo consists of a bomb placed at the end of a long pole  or spar  and attached to a boat  The weapon is used by running the end of the spar into the enemy ship  Spar torpedoes were often equipped with a barbed spear at the end  so it would stick to wooden hulls  A fuse could then be used to detonate it  The spar torpedo was invented in 1864 during the American Civil War by E  C  Singer  a private engineer who worked on secret projects for the benefit of the Confederate States of America  166  1865 Cowboy hat The cowboy hat is a high crowned  wide brimmed hat best known as the defining piece of attire for the North American cowboy  Today it is worn by many people  and is particularly associated with ranch workers in the western and southern United States  western Canada and northern Mexico  with country western singers  and for participants in the North American rodeo circuit  It is recognized around the world as part of Old West cowboy lore  The shape of a cowboy hat s crown and brim are often modified by the wearer for fashion and to protect against weather  The cowboy hat was invented in 1865 by John Batterson Stetson during a hunting trip  showing his companions how he could make fabric out of fur without weaving  Using the fur collected during the trip  his bare hands  and boiling water  Stetson made a piece of felt and then shaping it into a hat with a large brim which could protect he and his hunting party from weather elements such as rain  wind  and snow  167  1865 Rotary printing press  web  In 1865  William Bullock invented a printing press that could feed paper on a continuous roll and print both sides of the paper at once  Used first by the Philadelphia Ledger  the machine would become an American standard  It would also kill its inventor  who died when he accidentally fell into one of his presses  168  1866 Urinal  restroom version  Not to be confused with a urinal in bottle form that is used in health care  a urinal is a specialized toilet for urinating only  generally by men and boys  It has the form of being wall mounted  with drainage and automatic or manual flushing  The urinal was patented by Andrew Rankin on March 27  1866  169  1866 Chuckwagon The chuckwagon is a wagon that carries food and cooking equipment on the prairies of the United States and Canada  They were part of a wagon train of settlers to feed nomadic workers like cowboys or loggers  While mobile kitchens had existed for generations  the invention of the chuckwagon is attributed to Texan rancher Charles Goodnight who introduced the concept in 1866  170  1867 Motorcycle  steam powered  An 1860s drawing of the Roper steam velocipede The motorcycle is a single track  two wheeled motor vehicle powered by an engine  Although the first gasoline petrol motorcycle powered by an internal combustion engine was built in 1885 by a German named Gottlieb Daimler  his may not have been the first motorcycle  Ironically  Daimler s motorcycle used a four stroke internal combustion engine that wasn t of his own creation  instead having to rely upon an engine built by Nicolaus August Otto which he simply mounted onto the frame of a bicycle  Furthermore  if the definition of a motorcycle is inclusive of a steam engine and not exclusive to an internal combustion engine  then the world s first motorcycle may either have been American  a coal powered  two cylinder  steam driven motorcycle known as the Roper steam velocipede invented by Sylvester Howard Roper in 1867  171  172  or perhaps a French one  independently invented by a competing claim by French blacksmith Pierre Michaux and engineer Louis Guillaume Perreaux  who invented the Michaux Perreaux steam velocipede in 1868  173  1867 Paper clip The paper clip attaches sheets of paper together  allowing them to be detached as necessary  The first patent for a bent wire paper clip was awarded to its inventor  Samuel B  Fay  in 1867  174  1867 Barbed wire Barbed wire is a type of fencing wire constructed with sharp edges or points arranged at intervals along the strands  It is used to construct inexpensive fences and is used atop walls surrounding secured property  It is also a major feature of the fortifications in trench warfare  A person or animal trying to pass through or over barbed wire will suffer discomfort and possibly injury  Barbed wire fencing requires only fence posts  wire  and fixing devices such as staples  On June 25  1867  Lucien B  Smith of Kent  Ohio  patented barbed wire  Shortly thereafter  several other inventors  such as Joseph F  Glidden of DeKalb  Illinois  patented inventions for similar products  but Smith patented his first  allowing him to claim that he invented barbed wire  175  1867 Ticker tape Ticker tape is a means of transmitting stock price information over telegraph lines  It consists of a paper strip which ran through a machine called a stock ticker  which printed abbreviated company symbols followed by price and volume information  Ticker tape was invented in 1867 by Edward A  Calahan  an employee of the American Telegraph Company  176  1867 Water tube boiler A water tube boiler is a type of boiler in which water circulates in tubes heated externally by the fire  Water tube boilers are used for high pressure boilers  Fuel is burned inside the furnace  creating hot gas which heats up water in the steam generating tubes  The water tube boiler was co invented and co patented by George Herman Babcock and Stephen Wilcox in 1867  177  1867 Refrigerator car A refrigerator car or  reefer  is a refrigerated boxcar  designed to carry perishable freight at specific temperatures  Refrigerator cars differ from simple insulated boxcars and ventilated boxcars  neither of which are fitted with cooling apparatus  They can be ice cooled  or use one of a variety of mechanical refrigeration systems  or utilize carbon dioxide as a cooling agent  In the 1860s  slaughtered cattle from the Great Plains were preserved in barrels of salt  Regular box cars were loaded with ice in another effort to preserve fresh meat that had limited success  Generally  it was found more economical in the early days of refrigeration to cool the cars with ice or frozen brine which was periodically replenished at icing stations along rail routes  In 1857  the first shipment of refrigerated beef was made from the Chicago stockyards to the East Coast in an ordinary box car packed with ice  Finally in 1867  the first patent  U S  Patent  71 423  for a specialized refrigerator car was issued to its inventor  J B  Sutherland of Detroit  Michigan  178  1868 Paper bag Two paper bags A bag is a non rigid or semi rigid container usually made of paper which is used to hold items or packages  In 1868  Margaret E  Knight while living in Springfield  Massachusetts invented a machine that folded and glued paper to form the brown paper bags familiar to what shoppers know and use today  179  1868 Tape measure A tape measure or measuring tape is a flexible form of ruler  It consists of a ribbon of cloth  plastic  fiber glass  or metal strip with linear measurement markings  The design on which most modern spring tape measures are built was invented and patented by a New Haven  Connecticut resident named Alvin J  Fellows on July 14  1868  180  1869 Vibrator A vibrator is a device intended to vibrate against the body and stimulate the nerves for a relaxing and pleasurable feeling  Some vibrators are designed as sex toys and are inserted inside the vagina or anus for erotic stimulation  The first vibrator was a steam powered massager  which was invented by American physician George Taylor in 1869  181  Dr  Taylor recommended his vibrators for treatment of an illness known at the time as  female hysteria   Hysteria  from the Greek for  suffering uterus   involved anxiety  irritability  sexual fantasies  pelvic heaviness  and excessive vaginal lubrication in other words  sexual arousal  182  183  1869 American football A quarterback preparing to throw a pass American football  known in the United States simply as football  is a spectator sport known for combining strategy with competitive physical play  The objective of the game is to score points by advancing the ball into the opposing team s end zone  The ball can be advanced by carrying it  a running play  or by throwing it to a teammate  a passing play   Points can be scored in a variety of ways  including carrying the ball over the opponent s goal line  catching a pass thrown over that goal line  kicking the ball through the goal posts at the opponent s end zone  or tackling an opposing ball carrier within his end zone  The winner is the team with the most points when the time expires  The very first game of American football  a collegiate one  was held on November 6  1869 between Rutgers University and Princeton University with a final score of Rutgers 6 Princeton 4  184  The first professional game of American football was held on November 12  1892 between the Allegheny Athletic Association and the Pittsburgh Athletic Club ending in a 6 6 tie  185  As a descendant of rugby  the modern sport now known as American football is generally credited to its inventor  Walter Camp  who beginning in the 1880s  devised the play from scrimmage  the numerical assessment of goals and tries  the restriction of play to eleven men per side  set plays  sequences  and strategy features which led to the gradual evolution of the regulated game  Camp also was the leader of the American Football Rules Committee which devised the set of codified and regulated rules as to which American football continuously uses  186  1869 Pipe wrench The pipe wrench  or Stillson wrench  is an adjustable wrench used for turning soft iron pipes and fittings with a rounded surface  The design of the adjustable jaw allows it to rock in the frame  such that any forward pressure on the handle tends to pull the jaws tighter together  Teeth angled in the direction of turn dig into the soft pipe  The pipe wrench was invented by Daniel C  Stillson in 1869  187  1869 Clothes hanger A clothes hanger  or coat hanger  is a device in the shape of human shoulders designed to facilitate the hanging of a coat  jacket  sweater  shirt  blouse  or dress in a manner that prevents wrinkles  with a lower bar for the hanging of trousers or skirts  The shoulder shaped wire hanger  was inspired by a coat hook invented in 1869 by O  A  North of New Britain  Connecticut  188  1870 Bee smoker Firing a bee smoker A bee smoker  usually called simply a smoker  is a device used in beekeeping to calm honey bees  It is designed to generate smoke from the smouldering of various fuels  hence the name  The first bee smoker  which incorporated a bellows with a fire pot  was invented in 1870 by the renowned American beekeeper  Moses Quinby  189  1870 Can opener  rotary  The can opener is a device used to open metal cans  Most non electrical can openers today use the hand cranked rotary version consisting of a wheel with serated edges in order to pierce and cut the top of tin cans  The first rotary can opener with a cutting wheel was invented in 1870 by William W  Lyman  of Meriden  Connecticut  who received a U S  Patent 105 346 on July 12  1870  In 1925 the Star Can Opener Company of San Francisco improved on Lyman s wheel blade by adding a second  serrated or toothed wheel  called a  feed wheel  or  turning gear  to ride below the rim of the can and rotate the can against the cutting wheel  190  1870 Sandblasting Sandblasting or bead blasting is a generic term for the process of smoothing  shaping  and cleaning a hard surface by forcing solid particles across that surface at high speeds  Sandblasting equipment typically consists of a chamber in which sand and air are mixed  The mixture travels through a hand held nozzle to direct the particles toward the surface or workpiece  Nozzles come in a variety of shapes  sizes  and materials  Boron carbide is a popular material for nozzles because it resists abrasive wear well  In 1870  the sandblasting process was invented and patented by Benjamin Chew Tilghman  191  1870 Mixer  hand cranked  A hand mixer is a hand cranked mixing device for whipping  beating  and folding food ingredients  It typically consists of a handle mounted over a piston  which drives one or two beaters  The beaters are immersed in the food to be mixed  In 1870  Turner Williams of Providence  Rhode Island  invented the first hand cranked egg beater  who also obtained the first patent on record  U S  patent  103811 issued on May 30  1870  192  1870 Feather duster A feather duster is an implement used for cleaning  It consists typically of a wooden dowel handle and feathers that are wound onto the handle by a wrapped wire  In 1870  the original idea for the feather duster was conceived in a broom factory in Jones County  Iowa  USA  A farmer brought a bundle of turkey feathers into the factory asking if they could be used to assemble a brush  E E  Hoag used these feathers to invent the first feather duster  Using a short broom stick and splitting the feathers with a pocket knife  the duster was found to be too stiff for use  In 1874  the Hoag Duster Company was founded  which became a pioneer of feather dusters in the U S  state of Iowa  193  1872 Railway air brake A valve on a railway air brake A railway air brake is a conveyance braking system which applies the means of compressed air which modern locomotives use to this day  George Westinghouse  a pioneer of the electrical industry  invented the railroad air brake in 1872  194  1872 Diner A diner is a restaurant characterized by a wide range of foods  a casual and often nostalgic atmosphere  a counter  and late operating hours  The precursor to the fast food eatery began in 1872 when Walter Scott  a myopic pressman for the Providence Journal  became serious about selling food and refreshments in the streets  Scott had a plan  Instead of wearing out the soles of his shoes and roaming the streets of Providence  Rhode Island  he decided to buy a horse drawn delivery van  Rolling on four wagon wheels  he would take his food to the people  195  1873 Earmuffs Earmuffs cover a person s ears for thermal protection  Earmuffs consist of a thermoplastic or metal head band  that fits over the top of the head  and a pad at each end  to cover the external ears  Earmuffs were invented by Chester Greenwood in 1873  196  1873 Silo Two farm silos A silo is a structure for storing bulk materials  Silos are used in agriculture to store grain  see grain elevators  or fermented feed known as silage  Silos are more commonly used for bulk storage of grain  coal  cement  carbon black  woodchips  food products and sawdust  The first modern silo  a wooden and upright one filled with grain  was invented and built in 1873 by Fred Hatch of McHenry County  Illinois  USA  197  198  1873 Jeans Jeans are trousers generally made from denim  Jeans became popular among teenagers starting in the 1950s which remains as a distinct icon of American fashion  In 1873  Levi Strauss and Jacob Davis co invented and co patented the idea of using copper rivets at the stress points of sturdy work pants  After one of Davis  customers kept purchasing cloth to reinforce torn pants  he had an idea to use copper rivets to reinforce the points of strain  such as on the pocket corners and at the top of the button fly  Davis did not have the required money to purchase a patent  so he wrote to Strauss suggesting that they both go into business together  Early Levis  called  waist overalls   came in a brown canvas duck fabric and a heavy blue denim fabric  His business became extremely successful  revolutionizing the apparel industry  199  1873 Knuckle coupler Two railway cars interlocked and joined together by a knuckle coupler Also known as a Janney coupler and the buckeye coupler  the knuckle coupler is the derivative of a coupling device that links and connects rolling railway cars such as passenger  refrigerator  freight  and stock cars together on railroad track  The knuckle coupler have a bifurcated drawhead and a revolving hook  which  when brought in contact with another coupler  automatically interlocks with its mate  Knuckle couplers replaced the much more dangerous link and pin couplers and became the basis for standard coupler design for the rest of the 19th century  The knuckle coupler was invented and patented by Eli H  Janney in 1873  200  201  202  1874 Fire sprinkler  automated  A fire sprinkler is the part of a fire sprinkler system that discharges water when the effects of a fire have been detected  such as when a pre determined temperature has been reached  Henry S  Parmelee of New Haven  Connecticut invented and installed the first closed head or automated fire sprinkler in 1874  203  1874 Spork A spork or a foon is a hybrid form of cutlery taking the form of a spoon like shallow scoop with three or four fork tines  The spork is a portmanteau word combining spoon and fork  The spork was invented in 1874 by Samuel W  Francis  U S  patent  147 119 was filed on January 22  1874 and issued to Francis on February 3  1874  204  1874 Ice cream soda An ice cream soda is a beverage that consists of one or more scoops of ice cream in either a soft drink or a mixture of flavored syrup and carbonated water  Variations of the ice cream soda are as countless as the varieties of soda and flavors of ice cream  An example of ice cream soda is the root beer float  In 1874  the ice cream soda was invented by Robert M  Green of Philadelphia  Green s invention paved the way for the soda fountain industry to flourish and for many new spoon novelties such as ice cream sundaes to be created  205  1874 Quadruplex telegraph A quadruplex telegraph is a type of electrical telegraph which allows a total of four separate signals to be transmitted and received on a single wire at the same time  With two signals in each direction  quadruplex telegraphy thus implements a form of multiplexing  The quadruplex telegraph was invented by Thomas Alva Edison in 1874  which enabled Western Union to save money by greatly increasing the number of messages the company could send without building new lines  It also allowed the company to use its existing lines more efficiently to meet seasonal increases in message traffic and to lease excess capacity for private lines  206  1874 Jockstrap Marpage jockstrap and packaging  circa 1930 A jockstrap  also known as a jock  jock strap  strap  supporter  or athletic supporter  is an undergarment designed for supporting the male genitalia during sports or other vigorous physical activity  A jockstrap consists of a waistband  usually elastic  with a support pouch for the genitalia and two elastic straps affixed to the base of the pouch and to the left and right sides of the waistband at the hip  The jockstrap has been part of men s undergarments since 1874 when it was invented by C F  Bennett of Chicago to protect and support bicycle riders  back then they were known as  jockeys   who were navigating the cobblestone streets common to the era  207  208  1874 Forstner bit Forstner bits  also known as Forstner flange bits or webfoot augers  bore precise  flat bottomed holes in wood  in any orientation with respect to the wood grain  Forstner bits can cut on the edge of a block of wood  and can cut overlapping holes  Because of the flat bottom to the hole  they are useful for drilling through veneer already glued to add an inlay  Forstner bits were invented and patented by Benjamin Forstner in 1874  209  1874 QWERTY QWERTY is the most used modern day keyboard layout on English language computer and typewriter keyboards  It takes its name from the first six characters seen in the far left of the keyboard s top row of letters  The QWERTY design was invented and patented by Christopher Sholes in 1874  210  1875 Biscuit cutter A biscuit cutter a tool to cut out a biscuit from bread dough in a particular shape before they are put into an oven to bake  On May 11  1875  Alexander P  Ashbourne filed the first patent for the biscuit cutter that consisted of a board to roll the biscuits out on and hinged to a metal plate with various biscuit cutter shapes mounted to it  It was later issued on November 30  1875  211  1875 Dental drill  electric  A dental drill is a small  high speed drill used in dentistry to remove decayed tooth material prior to the insertion of a dental filling  George F  Green of Kalamazoo  Michigan invented the first electric powered device to drill teeth in 1875  212  1875 Mimeograph The stencil duplicator or mimeograph machine is a low cost printing press that works by forcing ink through a stencil onto paper  Once prepared  the stencil is wrapped around the ink filled drum of the rotary machine  When a blank sheet of paper is drawn between the rotating drum and a pressure roller  ink is forced through the holes on the stencil onto the paper  Thomas Alva Edison invented the mimeograph in 1875  213  1876 Synthesizer A synthesizer is an electronic instrument capable of producing sounds by generating electrical signals of different frequencies  These electrical signals are played through a loudspeaker or set of headphones  Synthesizers can usually produce a wide range of sounds  which may either imitate other instruments   imitative synthesis   or generate new timbres  The first electric synthesizer was invented in 1876 by Elisha Gray who accidentally discovered that he could control sound from a self vibrating electromagnetic circuit and in doing so  invented a basic single note oscillator  This musical telegraph used steel reeds whose oscillations were created and transmitted  over a telephone line  by electromagnets  Gray also built a simple loudspeaker device in later models consisting of a vibrating diaphragm in a magnetic field to make the oscillator audible  214  215  1876 Airbrush An airbrush is a small  air operated tool that sprays various media including ink and dye  but most often paint by a process of nebulization  Spray guns developed from the airbrush and are still considered a type of airbrush  The first airbrush was invented in 1876 by Francis Edgar Stanley of Newton  Massachusetts  216  1876 Tattoo machine A tattoo machine is a hand held device generally used to create a tattoo  a permanent marking of the skin with ink  The basic machine  which was called Stencil Pens  was invented by Thomas Alva Edison and patented in the United States in 1876  It was originally intended to be used as an engraving device  but in 1891  Sean Casey discovered that Edison s machine could be modified and used to introduce ink into the skin  and later patented it as a tube and needle system serving as an ink reservoir  217  1877 Phonograph Thomas Edison s talking machine The phonograph  record player or gramophone is an instrument for recording  reproducing and playing back sounds  The earliest phonographs used cylinders containing an audio recording engraved on the outside surface which could be reproduced when the cylinder was played  Later  the gramophone record with modulated spiral grooves set atop a rotating turntable  The phonograph was invented in 1877 by Thomas Alva Edison at his laboratory in Menlo Park  New Jersey  USA  218  219  220  221  On February 8  1878  Edison was issued the first patent  U S  patent  200 521  for the phonograph  222  1877 District heating District heating distributes heat generated in a centralized location for residential and commercial heating requirements  The heat is often obtained from a cogeneration plant burning fossil fuels but increasingly biomass  although heat only boiler stations  geothermal heating and central solar heating are also used  as well as nuclear power  The United States Naval Academy in Annapolis  Maryland began steam district heating service in 1853  However  the first commercially successful district heating system was launched in Lockport  New York  in 1877 by American hydraulic engineer Birdsill Holly  considered the founder of modern district heating  223   edit  Gilded Age  1878 1889  1878 Carbon microphone The carbon microphone is a sound to electrical signal transducer consisting of two metal plates separated by granules of carbon  When sound waves strike this plate  the pressure on the granules changes  which in turn changes the electrical resistance between the plates  A direct current is passed from one plate to the other  and the changing resistance results in a changing current  which can be passed through a telephone system  or used in other ways in electronics systems to change the sound into an electrical signal  After a lengthy court battle over patent rights filed in 1877  a United States federal court as well as a British court in 1878 ruled in favor of Thomas Alva Edison over a claim held by Emile Berliner since Edison indisputably preceded Berliner in inventing the transmission of speech as well as the use of carbon in a transmitter  224  1878 Free jet water turbine A free jet water turbine or impulse water turbine  also commonly known as a Pelton s wheel  is a wheel that uses cups  or buckets  that are split down the middle by a metal divider  so that in effect two cups are mounted side by side at each  spoke  in the wheel  A high pressure water jet aimed at the center of each bucket is split by the divider to hit each of cup  one on the left  the other on the right  The design of this water turbine takes advantage of a mechanics principle known as impulse  a force defined as the product of the force and the time during which it acts  In 1878  Lester Pelton invented his prototype known as the Pelton s wheel  first demonstrating it to miners in the Sierra Nevada  In 1880  Lester Pelton received a patent for his invention  225  1878 Bolometer A bolometer measures the energy of incident electromagnetic radiation  It was invented in 1878 by American astronomer Samuel Pierpont Langley  226  1879 Photographic plate Photographic plates preceded photographic film as a means of photography  A light sensitive emulsion of silver salts was applied to a glass plate  This form of photographic material largely faded from the consumer market in the early years of the 20th century  as more convenient and less fragile films were introduced  The wet collodion process was replaced by dry plates  Photographic plates were invented by George Eastman who filed U S  patent  226 503 on September 9  1879 which was issued to him on April 13  1880  157  227  1879 Carton A carton is the name of certain types of containers typically made from paperboard or cardboard  Many types of cartons are used in food packaging  Sometimes a carton is also called a box  The history of the carton goes as far back as 1879 when it was invented in a Brooklyn  New York factory  The inventor of the folded carton was Robert Gair  He cast a die ruled  cut  and scored paperboard into a single impression of a folded carton  By 1896  the National Biscuit Company was the first to use cartons to package crackers  228  1879 Cash register An example of a cash register in Japan The cash register is a device for calculating and recording sales transactions  When a transaction was completed  the first cash registers used a bell that rang and the amount was noted on a large dial on the front of the machine  During each sale  a paper tape was punched with holes so that the merchant could keep track of sales  Known as the  Incorruptible Cashier   the mechanical cash register was invented and patented in 1879 by James Ritty of Dayton  Ohio  John H  Patterson bought Ritty s patent and his cash register company in 1884  229  1880 Oil burner An oil burner is a heating device which burns fuel oil  The oil is directed under pressure through a nozzle to produce a fine spray  which is usually ignited by an electric spark with the air being forced through by an electric fan  In 1880  Amanda Jones invented the oil burner in the oil fields of northern Pennsylvania where Jones completed her trial and error efforts of heating furnaces  230  1880 Candlepin bowling Candlepin bowling is a North American variation of bowling that is played primarily in the Canadian Maritime provinces  Quebec  Maine  Massachusetts  and New Hampshire  A candlepin bowling lane somewhat resembles lanes used in tenpin bowling  However  unlike tenpin bowling lanes that are flat  candlepin lanes are slightly depressed ahead of the pindeck  The candlepins themselves take on a cylindrical shape which are tapered at the tops and bottoms  thus giving them a resemblance to wax candles  In 1880  candlepin bowling was invented by Justin White of Worcester  Massachusetts  231  1881 Electric chair Execution by electrocution is an execution method which the person being put to death is strapped to a specially built wooden chair and electrocuted through electrodes placed on the body  In 1881  Alfred Southwick witnessed an intoxicated man touch a live electric generator  After the man died quickly  Dr  Southwick concluded that electricity could be used as an alternative to hanging for executions  Southwick was a dentist who was accustomed to performing procedures on subjects in chairs  and so he designed an  electric chair   The first electric chair based on Southwick s design was made by Harold P  Brown and the first person to be executed via the electric chair was William Kemmler in New York s Auburn Prison on August 6  1890  232  1881 Metal detector Metal detectors use electromagnetic induction to detect metal  In 1881  the Scots American named Alexander Graham Bell invented the first metal detector as President James Garfield lay dying from a fatal gunshot wound  Despite an effort to locate the lodged bullet  Bell s invention proved to be unsuccessful as the metal detector was confused by the metal framed bed which the assassinated president laid on  233  1881 Iron  electric  An iron is a small appliance used to remove wrinkles from fabric  The electric iron was invented in 1881 and patented in 1882 by Henry W  Seely of New York  A second electric iron  a  cordless  one instead heated on a stand powered by electricity  was developed with his partner Dyer in 1883  234  1882 Fan  electric  An electric fan contains an arrangement of blades usually powered by an electric motor in order to produce airflow for the purpose of creating comfort  particularly in the heat   ventilation  or exhaust  Between the years 1882 and 1886  New Orleans resident Schuyler Skaats Wheeler invented the first electric fan  235  1883 Salt water taffy Salt water taffy is a variety of soft taffy  Despite the name  it does not contain sea water  The legend of how salt water taffy got its name is disputed  The most popular story  although unconfirmed  concerns a candy store owner  David Bradley  whose shop was flooded during a major storm in 1883  His entire stock of taffy was soaked with salty Atlantic Ocean water  When a young girl came into his shop and asked if he had any taffy for sale  he is said to have offered some  salt water taffy   At the time it was a joke  because all his taffy had been soaked with salt water  but the girl was delighted  she bought the candy and proudly walked down to the beach to show her friends  Bradley s mother was in the back and heard the exchange  She loved the name and so Salt Water Taffy was born  236  1883 Solar cell Solar panels at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada generating and absorbing the sun s natural light A solar cell is any device that directly converts the energy in light into electrical energy through the process of photovoltaics  Although French physicist Antoine C sar Becquerel discovered the photovoltaic effect much earlier in 1839  the first solar cell  according to Encyclop dia Britannica  was invented by Charles Fritts in 1883  who used junctions formed by coating selenium with an extremely thin layer of gold  In 1941  the silicon solar cell was invented by another American named Russell Ohl  Drawing upon Ohl s work  three American researchers named Gerald Pearson  Calvin Fuller  and Daryl Chapin essentially introduced the first practical use of solar panels through their improvement of the silicone solar cell in 1954  which by placing them in direct sunlight  free electrons are turned into electrical current enabling a six percent energy conversion efficiency  237  1883 Thermostat A thermostat is a device for regulating the temperature of a system so that the system s temperature is maintained near a desired setpoint temperature  The thermostat does this by switching heating or cooling devices on or off  or regulating the flow of a heat transfer fluid as needed  to maintain the correct temperature  The thermostat was invented in 1883 by Warren S  Johnson  238  1884 Machine gun Maxim s machine gun on display at the Military Museum of Finland The machine gun is defined as a fully automatic firearm  usually designed to fire rifle cartridges in quick succession from an ammunition belt or large capacity magazine  Thus  the world s first true machine gun  the Maxim gun  was invented in 1884 by the American inventor Hiram Stevens Maxim  who devised a recoil power of the previously fired bullet to reload rather than the crude method of a manually operated  hand cranked firearm  161  239  With the ability to fire 750 rounds per minute  Maxim s other great innovation was the use of water cooling to reduce overheating  Maxim s gun was widely adopted and derivative designs manufactured by Vickers were used on all sides during World War I  240  1884 Dissolvable pill A dissolvable pill is any pharmaceutical in tablet form that is ingested orally  which are crushable and able to dissolve in the stomach unlike tablets with hard coatings  The dissolvable pill was invented in 1884 by William E  Upjohn  241  1885 Lap steel guitar The lap steel guitar is a type of steel guitar that are designed to be adapted between lap and conventional playing  Lap steel guitars have strings raised at both the nut and bridge ends of the fingerboard  typically to about half an inch  The lap steel guitar was invented in 1885 by Joseph Kekuku of L  ie  a village on the island of O ahu  Hawaii  242  1885 Popcorn machine A popcorn machine  also called a popcorn maker  is a device used to pop popcorn  Commercial popcorn machines are usually found in movie theaters and carnivals  producing popcorn of the oil popped type  which has approximately 45  of its calories derived from fat  The first commercial popcorn machine was invented by Chicago resident Charles Cretors in 1885  His business that he founded  C  Cretors  amp  Company  still to this day manufactures popcorn machines and other specialty equipment  243  1885 Photographic film Photographic film is a sheet of material coated with a photosensitive emulsion  When the emulsion is sufficiently exposed to light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation such as X rays and is developed it forms an image  George Eastman and his company  Eastman Kodak  invented the first flexible photographic film as well as the invention of roll film in 1885  This original  film  used a paper carrier  The first transparent plastic film was produced in 1889  Before this  glass photographic plates were used  which were far more expensive and cumbersome  although of better quality due to their size  Early film was made from flammable nitrocellulose with camphor as a plasticizer  244  1885 Skyscraper A skyscraper is a tall building that uses a steel frame construction  After the Great Fire of 1871  Chicago had become a magnet for daring experiments in architecture as one of those was the birth of the skyscraper  William Le Baron Jenney completed the 10 story Home Insurance Company Building in 1885  the first to use steel frame construction  245  1885 Fuel dispenser A man using a fuel dispenser by pumping gasoline into plastic fuel containers A fuel dispenser is used to pump gasoline  diesel  or other types of fuel into vehicles or containers  As the automobile was not invented yet  the gas pump was used for kerosene lamps and stoves  Sylvanus F  Bowser of Fort Wayne  Indiana invented the gasoline petrol pump on September 5  1885  246  Coincidentally  the term  bowser  is still often used in countries such as New Zealand and Australia as a reference to the fuel dispenser  247  1886 Filing cabinet  horizontal  A filing cabinet is a piece of office furniture used to store paper documents in file folders  It is an enclosure for drawers in which items are stored  On November 2  1886  Henry Brown patented his invention of a  receptacle for storing and preserving papers   This was a fire and accident safe container made of forged metal  which could be sealed with a lock and key  It was special in that it kept the papers separated  248  1886 Telephone directory A telephone directory is a listing of telephone subscribers in a geographical area or subscribers to services provided by the organization that publishes the directory  R  H  Donnelley created the first official telephone directory which was referred to as the Yellow Pages in 1886  249  1887 Screen door A screen door can refer to a hinged storm door  cold climates  or hinged screen door  warm climates  covering an exterior door  or a screened sliding door used with sliding glass doors  In any case  the screen door incorporates screen mesh to block flying insects from entering and pets and small children from exiting interior spaces  while allowing for air  light  and views  The screen door was invented in 1887 by Hannah Harger  250  1887 Gramophone record A selection of gramophone records and an album A gramophone record  commonly known as a record  or a vinyl record  is an analog sound storage medium consisting of a flat disc with an inscribed  modulated spiral groove  The groove usually starts near the periphery and ends near the center of the disc  Ever since Thomas Edison invented the phonograph in 1877  it produced distorted sound because of gravity s pressure on the playing stylus  In response  Emile Berliner invented a new medium for recording and listening to sound in 1887 in the form of a horizontal disc  originally known as the  platter   251  1887 Slot machine A slot machine is a casino gambling machine  Due to the vast number of possible wins with the original poker card based game  it proved practically impossible to come up with a way to make a machine capable of making an automatic pay out for all possible winning combinations  The first  one armed bandit  was invented in 1887 by Charles Fey of San Francisco  California who devised a simple automatic mechanism with three spinning reels containing a total of five symbols   horseshoes  diamonds  spades  hearts and a Liberty Bell  which also gave the machine its name  252  1887 Softball As a bat and ball team sport  softball is a variant of baseball  The difference between the two sports is that softball uses larger balls and requires a smaller playing field  Beginning as an indoor game in Chicago  softball was invented in 1887 by George Hancock  253  1887 Comptometer A comptometer is a mechanical or electro mechanical adding machine  The comptometer was the first adding device to be driven solely by the action of pressing keys  which are arranged in an array of vertical and horizontal columns  Although the comptometer was designed primarily for adding  it could also do division  multiplication  and subtraction  Special comptometers with varying key arrays were produced for a variety of purposes  including calculating currencies  time and Imperial measures of weight  The original design was invented and patented in 1887 by Dorr Felt  254  1888 AC motor Nikola Tesla s AC induction motor In 1883  Nikola Tesla identified the rotating magnetic induction field principle and pioneered the use of this rotating and inducting electromagnetic field force to generate torque in rotating machines  Thus  Tesla further exploited this principle in his invention of a poly phase induction motor using alternating current in 1888  255  Introduction of Tesla s AC motor from 1888 onwards initiated what is sometimes referred to as the  Second Industrial Revolution   making possible both the efficient generation and long distance distribution of electrical energy using his alternating current system  The rights to Tesla s epoch making invention were bought by George Westinghouse  who demonstrated the system for the first time at the 1893 World s Columbian Exposition in Chicago  Two years later  Tesla s alternating current motors were installed at the Niagara Falls power project  256  On October 12  1887  Tesla filed U S  patent  381 968 for an electro magnetic motor which in the application  claimed to have invented the AC motor as well as a new power distribution system  257  The patent was granted on May 1  1888  258  1888 Kinetoscope The Kinetoscope was an early motion picture exhibition device  It was designed for films to be viewed individually through the window of a cabinet housing its components  The Kinetoscope introduced the basic approach that would become the standard for all cinematic projection before the advent of video  creating the illusion of movement by conveying a strip of perforated film bearing sequential images over a light source with a high speed shutter  First described in conceptual terms by Thomas Alva Edison in 1888  his invention was largely developed by one of his assistants  William Kennedy Laurie Dickson  between 1889 and 1892  259  1888 Trolley pole An example of a trolley pole used in Japan A trolley pole is a tapered cylindrical pole of wood or metal placed in contact with an overhead wire to provide electricity to the trolley car  The trolley pole sits atop a sprung base on the roof of the trolley vehicle  the springs maintaining the tension to keep the trolley wheel or shoe in contact with the wire  Occasionally  a Canadian named John Joseph Wright is credited with inventing the trolley pole when an experimental tramway in Toronto  Ontario was built in 1883  While Wright may have assisted in the installation of railways at the Canadian National Exhibition  CNE   and may even have used a pole system  there s no hard evidence to prove it  Likewise  Wright never filed or was issued a patent  260  Official credit for the invention of the electric trolley pole has gone to an American  Frank J  Sprague  who devised his working system in Richmond  Virginia  in 1888  260  Known as the Richmond Union Passenger Railway  this 12 mile system was the first large scale trolley line in the world  opening to great fanfare on February 12  1888  261  1888 Drinking straw The drinking straw is a tube used for transferring a liquid to the mouth  usually a drink from one location to another  The first crude forms of drinking straws were made of dry  hollow  rye grass  Marvin Stone is the inventor of the drinking straw  Stone  who worked in a factory that made paper cigarette holders  did not like this design because it made beverages taste like grass  As an alternative  on January 3  1888  Stone got a piece of paper from his factory and wrapped it around a pencil  By coating it with wax  his drinking straw became leak proof so that it would not get waterlogged  262  1888 Stepping switch An example of a Strowger type selector assembly In electrical controls  a stepping switch  also known as a stepping relay  is an electromechanical device which allows an input connection to be connected to one of a number of possible output connections  under the control of a series of electrical pulses  The major use for these devices was in early automatic telephone exchanges to route telephone calls  It can step on one axis  called a uniselector   or on two axes  a Strowger switch   As the first automated telephone switch using electromagnets and hat pins  stepping switches were invented by Almon Brown Strowger in 1888  Strowger filed his patent application on March 12  1889  and it was issued on March 10  1891  263  1888 Revolving door A revolving door has three or four doors that hang on a center shaft and rotate around a vertical axis within a round enclosure  In high rise buildings  regular doors are hard to open because of air pressure differentials  In order to address this problem  the revolving door was invented in 1888 by Theophilus Van Kannel of Philadelphia  Pennsylvania  Van Kannel patented the revolving door on August 7  1888  264  1888 Ballpoint pen The tip of a ballpoint pen A ballpoint pen is a writing instrument with an internal ink reservoir and a sphere for a point  The internal chamber is filled with a viscous ink that is dispensed at its tip during use by the rolling action of a small sphere  The first ballpoint pen is the creation of American leather tanner John Loud of Weymouth  Massachusetts in 1888 which contained a reservoir for ink and a roller ball to mark up his leather hides  Despite Loud being the inventor of the ballpoint pen  it wasn t a practical success since the ink often leaked or clogged up  265  266  267  Loud took out a patent  British patent  15630  in the United Kingdom on October 30  1888  268  However  it wasn t until 1935 when Hungarian newspaper editor L szl  B r  offered an improved version of the ballpoint pen that left paper smudge free  267  1888 Telautograph The telautograph  an analog precursor to the modern fax machine  transmits electrical impulses recorded by potentiometers at the sending station to stepping motors attached to a pen at the receiving station  thus reproducing at the receiving station a drawing or signature made by sender  It was the first such device to transmit drawings to a stationary sheet of paper  The telautograph s invention is attributed to Elisha Gray  who patented it in 1888  269  1888 Touch typing Touch typing is typing on a keyboard without using the sense of sight to find the keys  Specifically  a touch typist will know their location on the keyboard through muscle memory  Touch typing typically involves placing the eight fingers in a horizontal row along the middle of the keyboard  the home row  and having them reach for other keys  Touch typing was invented in 1888 by Frank Edward McGurrin  a court stenographer from Salt Lake City  Utah  270  1889 Flexible flyer A boy atop a flexible flyer sled in 1945 A flexible flyer or steel runner sled is a steerable wooden sled with thin metal runners whereby a rider may sit upright on the sled or lie on their stomach  allowing the possibility to descend a snowy slope feet first or head first  To steer the sled  the rider may either push on the wooden cross piece with their hands or feet  or pull on the rope attached to the wooden cross piece  The flexible flyer was invented in 1889 by Philadelphia resident Samuel Leeds Allen  271  U S  patent  408 681 was issued to Allen on August 13  1889  272  1889 Payphone A payphone or pay phone is a public telephone  usually located in a stand alone upright container such as a phone booth  with payment done by inserting money  usually coins   a credit or debit card  or a telephone card before the call is made  Pay telephone stations preceded the invention of the pay phone and existed as early as 1878  These stations were supervised by telephone company attendants or agents who collected the money due after people made their calls  In 1889  the first coin operated telephone was installed by inventor William Gray at a bank in Hartford  Connecticut  However  it was a  postpay  machine that only accepted coins deposited after the call was placed  273  274   edit  See also United States portal Technology portal Timelines of United
