edit  The philanthropist and the founding See also  Johns Hopkins  Philanthropy and Legacy Johns Hopkins On his death in 1873  Johns Hopkins  a Quaker entrepreneur and childless bachelor  bequeathed  7 million to fund a hospital and university in Baltimore  Maryland  11  At that time this fortune  generated primarily from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad  12  was the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the United States  13  The first name of philanthropist Johns Hopkins is the surname of his great grandmother  Margaret Johns  who married Gerard Hopkins  They named their son Johns Hopkins  who named his own son Samuel Hopkins  Samuel named one of his sons after his father and that son would be the university s benefactor  In his 2001 undergraduate commencement address  university president William R  Brody said about the name   In 1888  just 12 years after the university was founded  Mark Twain wrote about this university in a letter to a friend  He said   A few months ago I was told that the Johns Hopkins University had given me a degree  I naturally supposed this constituted me a Member of the Faculty and so I started in to help as I could there  I told them I believed they were perfectly competent to run a college as far as the higher branches of education are concerned  but what they needed was a little help here and there from a practical commercial man  I said the public is sensitive to little things and they wouldn t have full confidence in a college that didn t know how to spell the name John   More than a century later  we continue to bestow diplomas upon individuals of outstanding capabilities and great talent  And we continue to spell Johns with an s   14  Milton Eisenhower  once the university  president  once spoke to a convention in Pittsburgh  Making a common mistake  the Master of Ceremonies introduced him as  President of John Hopkins   Eisenhower retorted that he was  glad to be here in Pittburgh   15   edit  Early years and Daniel Coit Gilman The original board opted for an entirely novel university model dedicated to the discovery of knowledge at an advanced level  extending that of contemporary Germany  Johns Hopkins thereby became the model of the modern research university in the United States  Its success eventually shifted higher education in the United States from a focus on teaching revealed and or applied knowledge to the scientific discovery of new knowledge  The founders intended the university to be national in scope to strengthen ties across a divided country in the aftermath of the American Civil War  Therefore  the university s official inauguration took on great significance  1876 was the nation s centennial year and February 22 was George Washington s birthday  Wikisource has the text of a 1911 Encyclop dia Britannica article about the Early History  The University s viability depended on its first president  Daniel Coit Gilman  recruited from the presidency of the University of California  Gilman launched what many at the time considered an audacious and unprecedented academic experiment to merge teaching and research  He dismissed the idea that the two were mutually exclusive   The best teachers are usually those who are free  competent and willing to make original researches in the library and the laboratory   he stated  To implement his plan  Gilman recruited internationally known luminaries such as the biologist H  Newell Martin  the physicist Henry A  Rowland  the first president of the American Physical Society   the classical scholars Basil Gildersleeve and Charles D  Morris  16  the economist Richard T  Ely  and the chemist Ira Remsen  who became the second president of the university in 1901  Daniel Coit Gilman Gilman focused on the expansion of knowledge  graduate education and support of faculty research  To Gilman  Johns Hopkins existed not for the sake of God  the state  the community  the board  the parents  or even the students  but for knowledge  Faculty who added to such knowledge were rewarded  A complementary focus on graduate education fused advanced scholarship with such professional schools as medicine and engineering  Hopkins became the national trendsetter in doctoral programs and the host for numerous scholarly journals and associations with the founding of the first university press in 1878  With the completion of Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1889 and the medical school in 1893  the university s research focused mode of instruction soon began attracting world renowned faculty members who would become major figures in the emerging field of academic medicine  including William Osler  William Halsted  Howard Kelly  and William Welch  During this period Hopkins made more history by becoming the first medical school to admit women on an equal basis with men and to require a Bachelors degree  based on the efforts of Mary E  Garrett  who had endowed the school at Gilman s request  In his will and in his instructions to the trustees of the university and the hospital  Hopkins requested that both institutions be built upon the vast grounds of his Baltimore estate  Clifton  When Gilman assumed the presidency  he decided that it would be best to use the university s endowment for recruiting faculty and students  deciding to  build men  not buildings   In his will Hopkins stipulated that none of his endowment should be used for construction  only interest on the principal could be used for this purpose  Unfortunately  stocks in The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad  which would have generated most of the interest  became virtually worthless soon after Hopkins s death  The university s first home was thus in Downtown Baltimore delaying plans to site the university in Clifton  This decision became the only major criticism of Gilman s presidency  In the early 20th century the university outgrew its buildings and the trustees began to search for a new home  Developing Clifton for the university was too costly  and so the estate became a public park  In the end  the 140 acres  57 ha  estate in north Baltimore known as Homewood was purchased as the university s new campus with assistance from prominent Baltimore citizens  Since the 1910s  Johns Hopkins University has famously been a  fertile cradle  to Arthur Lovejoy s history of ideas  17  Presidents of the university Name

established one of the nation s oldest schools of nursing in 1889  The school of medicine was America s first coeducational  graduate level medical school  and was a prototype for academic medicine that emphasized bedside learning  research projects  and laboratory training  In 1909  the university was among the first to start adult continuing education programs and in 1916 it founded the US  first school of public health  Programs in international studies and the performing arts were established in 1950 and 1977 when the Paul H  Nitze School of Advanced International Studies in Washington D C and the Peabody Institute in Baltimore became divisions of the university   edit  Civil rights  edit  African Americans Hopkins was a prominent abolitionist who supported Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War  After his death  reports said his conviction was a decisive factor in enrolling Hopkins  first African American student  Kelly Miller  a graduate student in physics  astronomy and mathematics  and in admitting Harvard trained physician Whitfield Winsey and two other African American physicians to Maryland s Medical and Chirurgical Society MedChi  18  These physicians could attend meetings only because they were held on campus  As the memory of Hopkins faded and trustees like King died  Hopkins became like other Baltimore institutions  particularly in terms of race  The Johns Hopkins University chronology stated that on March 15  1892  an administrator hired by Gilman recommended that the hospital should have a   separate ward for colored patients   19  Johns Hopkins Hospital subsequently became segregated  Johns Hopkins   separate but equal  stance was evident when it came to these segregated wards   Special care will be taken to see that the heating and ventilation apparatus is as perfect as possible  A sun balcony will be erected on each floor on the east side  for convalescents  while a sun bay window will be constructed at the south end of the south wing  On each floor there will be a dining room  kitchen  lavatory and bath rooms   The building will be fireproof throughout   19  As segregation grew within Johns Hopkins institutions  it affected pay  hiring and promotions  Staff in segregated wards and those employed in the lower rungs of the service industries had the longest history within the Johns Hopkins Institutions  Johns Hopkins  students  physicians  administrators and staff of African descent had a much shorter history within these institutions  The first black undergraduate was Frederick Scott who entered the school in 1945  In 1967 the first black students earned graduate degrees  Dr  James Nabwangu a British trained Kenyan  was the first black graduate of the medical school  A second was earned by Robert Gamble  20  The first African American instructor was laboratory supervisor Vivien Thomas  who also invented and developed research instruments  served as an assistant in surgery to surgeon Alfred Blalock and worked closely with Blalock and Helen Taussig in developing and conducting the first successful blue baby operation  Black students and professionals were rare at Johns Hopkins Institutions and Maryland s state medical societies until after the 1940s  Diversity increased only in the 1960s and 1970s  African Americans and women were labeled  The Uninvited  in the second major history of the university  citation needed   edit  Women Hopkins  most well known battle for women s rights was the one led by daughters of trustees of the university  Mary E  Garrett  M  Carey Thomas  Mamie Gwinn  Elizabeth King  and Julia Rogers  21  They donated and raised the funds needed to open the medical school  and required Hopkins  officials to agree to their stipulation that women would be admitted  Unfortunately  this stipulation applied only to the medical school  Other graduate schools were opened to women by president Ira Remsen only in 1907  Christine Ladd Franklin was the first woman to earn a PhD at Hopkins  in mathematics in 1882  The trustees denied her the degree and refused to change the policy about admitting women  she finally received her degree 44 years later  In 1893 Florence Bascomb became the university s first female PhD  21  The nursing school opened in 1889 and accepted women and men as students  The decision to admit women at undergraduate level was not considered until the late 1960s and was eventually adopted in October 1969  in the fall of 1970  90 females  five of them African American  became undergraduates  In the academic year 1970 1971  4 7  of students in the Arts and Sciences programs were women  In the year 1985 1986 the proportion of female students in the Arts and Sciences programs had increased to around 38   As of 2009 2010  the undergraduate population was 47  female and 53  male  22   edit  Campuses Main Campuses  amp  Divisions Homewood East Baltimore  Medical Institutions Campus  Downtown Baltimore Washington D C  Laurel

serving Johns Hopkins academic programs worldwide  The library was named for Milton S  Eisenhower  former president of the university and brother of former U S  president Dwight D  Eisenhower  JHU s library was previously housed in Gilman Hall  and other smaller departmental libraries throughout the Homewood campus  80  Only two of the Eisenhower library s six stories are above ground  though the architects designed the building so that every level has windows and natural light  The design accords with a bit of traditional campus lore that no structure can be taller than Gilman Hall  the oldest academic building   although no written rule limits building height   In December 2008  an addition directly to the south of the library was announced  The six and a half story expansion will be named the Brody Learning Commons in honor of University President William R  Brody and will function as a   collaborative learning space   It is scheduled to be completed by 2012  81   edit
