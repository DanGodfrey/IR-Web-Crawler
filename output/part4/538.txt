Space Race From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search For a discussion of all spaceflight programs to date  see History of spaceflight  For a list of key events  see Timeline of space exploration  For other uses of the term  see Space Race  disambiguation   A replica of Sputnik 1  the world s first artificial satellite  launched in 1957 Neil Armstrong  one of the first two men to land on the Moon  and the first to walk on it  in 1969 The Space Race was a mid to late 20th century competition between the Soviet Union  USSR  and the United States  US  for supremacy in space exploration  Between 1957 and 1975  Cold War rivalry between the two nations focused on attaining firsts in space exploration  which were seen as necessary for national security and symbolic of technological and ideological superiority  The Space Race involved pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites  sub orbital and orbital human spaceflight around the Earth  and piloted voyages to the Moon  It effectively began with the Soviet launch of the Sputnik 1 artificial satellite on 4 October 1957  and concluded with the co operative Apollo Soyuz Test Project human spaceflight mission in July 1975  The Apollo Soyuz Test Project came to symbolize d tente  a partial easing of strained relations between the USSR and the US  The Space Race had its origins in the missile based arms race that occurred just after the end of the World War II  when both the Soviet Union and the United States captured advanced German rocket technology and personnel  The Space Race sparked unprecedented increases in spending on education and pure research  which accelerated scientific advancements and led to beneficial spin off technologies  An unforeseen effect was that the Space Race contributed to the birth of the environmental movement  the first color pictures of Earth taken from deep space were used as icons by the movement to show the planet as a fragile  blue marble  surrounded by the blackness of space  Some famous probes and missions include Sputnik 1  Explorer 1  Vostok 1  Mariner 2  Ranger 7  Luna 9  Apollo 8  and Apollo 11  Contents 1 Origins 1 1 World War II

operational ballistic missiles  Starting in the early 1930s  German aerospace engineers experimented with liquid fueled rockets  with the goal that one day they would be capable of reaching high altitudes and traversing long distances  1  The head of the German Army s Ballistics and Munitions Branch  Lieutenant Colonel Karl Emil Becker  gathered a small team of engineers that included Walter Dornberger and Leo Zanssen  to figure out how to use rockets as long range artillery in order to get around the Treaty of Versailles  ban on research and development of long range cannons  2 Wernher von Braun  a young engineering prodigy  was recruited by Becker and Dornberger to join their secret army program at Kummersdorf West in 1932  3  Von Braun had romantic dreams about conquering outer space with rockets  and did not initially see the military value in missile technology  4  During the Second World War  General Dornberger was the military head of the army s rocket program  Zanssen became the commandant of the Peenem nde army rocket centre  and von Braun was the technical director of the ballistic missile program  5  They would lead the team that built the Aggregate 4  A 4  rocket  which became the first vehicle to reach outer space during its test flight program in 1942 and 1943  6  By 1943  Germany began mass producing the A 4 as the Vergeltungswaffe 2   Vengeance Weapon  2  or more commonly  V2   a ballistic missile with a 320 kilometres  200 mi  range carrying a 1 130 kilograms  2 500 lb  warhead at 4 000 kilometres per hour  2 500 mph   7  Its supersonic speed meant there was no defense against it  and radar detection provided little warning  8  Germany used the weapon to bombard southern England and parts of Allied liberated western Europe from 1944 until 1945  9  After the war  the V 2 became the basis of early American and Soviet rocket designs  10  11  At war s end  American  British  and Soviet scientific intelligence teams competed to capture Germany s rocket engineers along with the German rockets themselves and the designs they were based on  12  Each of the Allies captured a share of the available members of the German rocket team  but the United States benefited the most with Operation Paperclip  recruiting von Braun and most of his engineering team  who later helped develop the American missile and space exploration programs  The United States also acquired a large number of complete V2 rockets  10   edit  Rocket teams assembled The German rocket center at Peenem nde was located in the eastern part of Germany  which became the Soviet zone of occupation  On Stalin s orders  the Soviet Union sent its best rocket engineers to this region to see what they could salvage for future weapons systems  13  The Soviet rocket engineers were led by Sergei Korolev  13  He had been involved in space clubs and early Soviet rocket design in the 1930s  but was arrested in 1938 during Joseph Stalin s Great Purge and imprisoned for six years in Siberia  14  After the war  he became the USSR s chief rocket and spacecraft engineer  essentially the Soviets  counterpart to Von Braun  15  His identity was kept a state secret throughout the Cold War  and he was identified publicly only as  the Chief Designer   15  In the West  his name was only officially revealed when he died in 1966  15  After almost a year in the area around Peenem nde  Soviet officials moved most of the captured German rocket specialists to Gorodomlya Island on Lake Seliger  about 240 kilometres  150 mi  northwest of Moscow  16  They were not allowed to participate in Soviet missile design  but were used as problem solving consultants to the Soviet engineers  17  They helped in the following areas  the creation of a Soviet version of the A 4  work on  organizational schemes   research in improving the A 4 main engine  development of a 100 ton engine  assistance in the  layout  of plant production rooms  and preparation of rocket assembly using German components  16  With their help  particularly Helmut Groettrup s group  Korolev reverse engineered the A 4 and built his own version of the rocket  the R 1  in 1948  18  Later  he developed his own distinct designs  though many of these designs were influenced by the Groettrup Group s G4 R10 design from 1949  18  The Germans were eventually repatriated in 1951 53  18  In America  Von Braun and his team were sent to the United States Army s White Sands Proving Ground  located in New Mexico  in 1945  19  They set about assembling the captured V2s and began a program of launching them and instructing American engineers in their operation  20  These tests led to the first rocket to take photos from outer space  and the first two stage rocket  the WAC Corporal V2 combination  in 1949  20  The German rocket team was moved from Fort Bliss to the Army s new Redstone Arsenal  located in Huntsville  Alabama  in 1950  21  From here  Von Braun and his team would develop the Army s first operational medium range ballistic missile  the Redstone rocket  that would  in slightly modified versions  launch both America s first satellite  and the first piloted Mercury space missions  21  It became the basis for both the Jupiter and Saturn family of rockets  21   edit  Cold War arms race The cold war would become the great engine  the supreme catalyst  that sent rockets and their cargoes far above Earth and worlds away  If Tsiolkovsky  Oberth  Goddard  and others were the fathers of rocketry  the competition between capitalism and communism was its midwife  William E  Burrows This New Ocean   The Other World Series   p  147 The Cold War  1947 1991  developed between two former allies  the Soviet Union and the United States  soon after the end of the Second World War  It involved a continuing state of political conflict  military tension  proxy wars  and economic competition  primarily between the Soviet Union and its satellite states  and the powers of the Western world  particularly the United States  22  Although the primary participants  military forces never clashed directly  they expressed this conflict through military coalitions  strategic conventional force deployments  extensive aid to states deemed vulnerable  proxy wars  espionage  propaganda  a nuclear arms race  and economic and technological competitions  such as the Space Race  22  In simple terms  the Cold War can be viewed as an expression of the ideological struggle between communism and democracy  23  The United States faced a new uncertainty beginning in September 1949  when it lost its monopoly on the atomic bomb   23  American intelligence agencies discovered that the Soviet Union had exploded its first atomic bomb  with the consequence that the United States potentially could face a future nuclear war that  for the first time  might devastate its cities  23  Given this new danger  the United States participated in an arms race with the Soviet Union that included development of the hydrogen bomb  as well as intercontinental strategic bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles  ICBMs  capable of delivering nuclear weapons  23  A new fear of communism and its sympathizers swept the United States during the 1950s  which devolved into paranoid McCarthyism  23  With communism spreading in China  Korea  and Eastern Europe  Americans came to feel so threatened that popular and political culture condoned extensive  witch hunts  to expose communist spies  23  Part of the American reaction to the Soviet atomic and hydrogen bomb tests included maintaining a large Air Force  under the control of the Strategic Air Command  SAC   SAC employed intercontinental strategic bombers  as well as medium bombers based close to Soviet airspace  in western Europe and in Turkey  that were capable of delivering nuclear payloads  24  For its part  the Soviet Union harbored fears of invasion  Having suffered at least 27 million casualties during World War II after being invaded by Nazi Germany in 1941  25  the Soviet Union was wary of its former ally  the United States  which until late 1949 was the sole possessor of atomic weapons  The United States had used these weapons operationally during World War II  and it could use them again against the Soviet Union  laying waste its cities and military centers  25  Since the Americans had a much larger air force than the Soviet Union  and the United States maintained advance air bases near Soviet territory  in 1947 Stalin ordered the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles  ICBMs  in order to counter the perceived American threat  17  In 1953  Korolev was given the go ahead to develop the R 7 Semyorka rocket  which represented a major advance from the German design  Although some of its components  notably boosters  still resembled the German G 4  the new rocket incorporated staged design  a completely new control system  and a new fuel  It was successfully tested on 21 August 1957 and became the world s first fully operational ICBM the following month  26  It would later be used to launch the first satellite into space  and derivatives would launch all piloted Soviet spacecraft  27  The United States had multiple rocket programs divided among the different branches of the American armed services  which meant that each force developed its own ICBM program  The Air Force initiated ICBM research in 1945 with the MX 774  28  However  its funding was cancelled and only three partially successful launches were conducted in 1947  28  In 1951  the Air Force began a new ICBM program called MX 1593  and by 1955 this program was receiving top priority funding  28  The MX 1593 program evolved to become the Atlas A  with its maiden launch occurring on 11 June 1957  becoming the first successful American ICBM  28  Its upgraded version  the Atlas D rocket  would later serve as an operational nuclear ICBM and be used as the orbital launch vehicle for Project Mercury and the remote controlled Agena Target Vehicle used in Project Gemini  28  With the Cold War as an engine for change in the ideological competition between the United States and the Soviet Union  a coherent space policy began to take shape in the United States during the late 1950s  29  Korolev would take much inspiration from the competition as well  achieving many firsts to counter the possibility that the United States might prevail  30   edit  Early Space Race  1950s  edit  Beginnings In 1955  with both the United States and the Soviet Union building ballistic missiles that could be utilized to launch objects into space  the  starting line  was drawn for the Space Race  31  In separate announcements  just four days apart  both nations publicly announced that they would launch artificial Earth satellites by 1957 or 1958  31  On 29 July 1955  James C  Hagerty  president Dwight D  Eisenhower s press secretary  announced that the United States intended to launch  small Earth circling satellites  between 1 July 1957 and 31 December 1958 as part of their contribution to the International Geophysical Year  IGY   31  Four days later  at the Sixth Congress of International Astronautical Federation in Copenhagen  scientist Leonid I  Sedov spoke to international reporters at the Soviet embassy  and announced his country s intention to launch a satellite as well  in the  near future   31  On 30 August 1955  Korolev managed to get the Soviet Academy of Sciences to create a commission whose purpose was to beat the Americans into Earth orbit  this was the defacto start date for the Space Race  31  Initially  President Eisenhower was worried that a satellite passing above a nation at over 100 kilometres  62 mi   might be construed as violating that nation s sovereign airspace  32  He was concerned that the Soviet Union would accuse the Americans of an illegal overflight  thereby scoring a propaganda victory at his expense  33  Eisenhower and his advisors believed that a nation s airspace sovereignty did not extend into outer space  acknowledged as the K rm n line  and he used the 1957 58 International Geophysical Year launches to establish this principle in international law  32  Eisenhower also feared that he might cause an international incident and be called a  Warmonger  if he were to use military missiles as launchers  Therefore he selected the untried Naval Research Laboratory s Vanguard rocket  which was a research only booster  34  This meant that von Braun s team was not allowed to put a satellite into orbit with their Jupiter C rocket  because of its intended use as a future military vehicle  34  On 20 September 1956  von Braun and his team did launch a Jupiter C that was capable of putting a satellite into orbit  however the launch was used only as a suborbital test of nose cone reentry technology  34  Had von Braun s team been allowed to orbit a satellite in 1956  the Space Race might have been over before it gained sufficient momentum to yield real benefits  citation needed   edit  First artificial satellites The signals of Sputnik 1 continued for 22 days  Korolev received word about von Braun s 1956 Jupiter C test  but thinking it was a satellite mission that failed  he expedited plans to get his own satellite in orbit  Since his R 7 was substantially more powerful than any of the American boosters  he made sure to take full advantage of this capability by designing Object D as his primary satellite  35  It was given the designation  D   to distinguish it from other R 7 payload designations  A    B    G   and  V  which were nuclear weapon payloads  36  Object D would dwarf the proposed American satellites  by having a weight of 1 400 kilograms  3 100 lb   of which 300 kilograms  660 lb  would be composed of scientific instruments that would photograph the Earth  take readings on radiation levels  and check on the planet s magnetic field  36  However  things were not going along well with the design and manufacturing of the satellite  so in February 1957  Korolev sought and received permission from the USSR Council of Ministers to create a prosteishy sputnik  PS 1   or simple satellite  35  The Council also decreed that Object D be postponed until April 1958  37  The new sputnik was a shiny spherical ball that would be a much lighter craft  weighing 83 8 kilograms  185 lb  and having a 58 centimetre  23 in  diameter   38  The satellite would not contain the complex instrumentation that Object D had  but it did have two radio transmitters operating on different short wave radio frequencies  the ability to detect if a meteoroid were to penetrate its pressure hull  and the ability to detect the density of the Earth s thermosphere  39  Korolev was buoyed by the first successful launches of his R 7 rocket in August and September  paving the way for him to launch his sputnik  40  Word came that the Americans were planning to announce a major breakthrough at an International Geophysical Year conference at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington D C   with a paper entitled  Satellite Over the Planet   on 6 October 1957  41  Korolev s fear was that von Braun might launch a Jupiter C with a satellite payload  on  or around  the fourth or fifth of October  in conjunction with the paper  41  The fear of being beaten made him hasten the launch  moving it to the fourth of October  41  The launch vehicle for PS 1  was a modified R 7   vehicle 8K71PS number M1 PS  without much of the test equipment and radio gear that was present in the previous launches  40  It arrived at the Soviet missile base Tyura Tam in September and was prepared for its mission at launch site number one  40  On Friday  4 October 1957  at exactly 10 28 34 p m  Moscow time  the R 7  with the now named Sputnik 1 satellite  lifted off the launch pad  and placed this artificial  moon  into an orbit a few minutes later  42  But the celebrations were muted at the launch control centre until the down range far east tracking station at Kamchatka received the first distinctive beep   beep   beep sounds from Sputnik 1 s radio transmitters  indicating that it was on its way to completing its first orbit  42  About 95 minutes after launch  the satellite flew over its launch site  and its radio signals were picked up by the engineers and military personnel at Tyura Tam  that s when Korolev and his team celebrated the first successful artificial satellite placed into Earth orbit  43  Launch rocket family of Sputnik  Laika  Gagarin  and more   R7 Soyuz The Soviet success caused public controversy in the United States  and Eisenhower ordered the civilian rocket and satellite project  Vanguard  to move up its timetable and launch its satellite much sooner than originally planned  44  The 6 December 1957 Project Vanguard launch failure occurred at Cape Canaveral in front of a live broadcast television audience in the United States  44  Only in the wake of this very public failure did von Braun s Redstone team get the go ahead to launch their Jupiter C rocket as soon as they could  Nearly four months after the launch of Sputnik 1  von Braun and the United States successfully launched its first satellite  on a modified Redstone booster  under the  civilian  name Juno 1 to differentiate it from the army s Redstone missile  The Juno 1 carried the Explorer 1 satellite  44  and the Explorer 1 s flight data confirmed the existence of an Earth encompassing radiation belt  previously theorized by James Van Allen  Confirmation of the Van Allen radiation belt was considered one of the outstanding discoveries of the International Geophysical Year  44   edit  Space Race in the 1960s  edit  First humans in space The first human to travel into orbit  Yuri Gagarin  launched in 1961  On 12 April 1961  the Soviet Union won the race with the United States to get a human into space  when Yuri Gagarin was launched into orbit around the Earth on Vostok 1  45  They dubbed Gagarin the first cosmonaut  roughly translated from Russian and Greek as  sailor of the universe   Although he had the ability to take over manual control of his spacecraft in an emergency  it was flown in an automatic mode as a precaution  medical science at that time did not know what would happen to a human in the weightlessness of space  45  Vostok 1 orbited the Earth for 108 minutes and made its reentry over the Soviet Union  with Gagarin ejecting from the spacecraft at 7 000 metres  23 000 ft   and landing by parachute  45  Under F d ration A ronautique Internationale  International Federation of Aeronautics  FAI qualifying rules for aeronautical records  pilots must both take off and land with their craft  so the Soviets kept the landing procedures secret until 1978  when they finally admitted that Gagarin did not land with his spacecraft  45  When the flight was publicly announced  it was celebrated around the world as a great triumph  not just for the Soviet Union  but for the world itself  though it once again shocked and embarrassed the United States  46  The United States called their space travelers astronauts   star sailors  from the Greek   and it was 3 weeks later  on 5 May 1961  when Alan Shepard became the first one in space  launched on a suborbital mission Mercury Redstone 3  in a spacecraft named Freedom 7  47  Though he did not achieve orbit  unlike Gagarin he was the first person to exercise manual control over his spacecraft s attitude and retro rocket firing  48  The first Soviet cosmonaut to exercise manual control was Gherman Titov in Vostok 2 on 6 August 1961  49  Almost a year after the Soviets put a human into orbit  astronaut John Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth  on 20 February 1962  50  His Mercury Atlas 6 mission completed three orbits in the Friendship 7 spacecraft  and splashed down safely in the Atlantic Ocean  after a tense reentry  due to what falsely appeared from the telemetry data to be a loose heat shield  50   edit  Kennedy launches the Moon race We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things  not because they are easy  but because they are hard  because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills  because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept  one we are unwilling to postpone  and one which we intend to win  and the others  too  It is for these reasons that I regard the decision last year to shift our efforts in space from low to high gear as among the most important decisions that will be made during my incumbency in the office of the Presidency  John F  Kennedy  Speech at Rice University  Houston  12 September 1962 51  On 20 April 1961  about one week after Gagarin s flight  American President John F  Kennedy sent a memo to Vice President Lyndon B  Johnson  asking him to look into the state of America s space program  and into programs that could offer NASA the opportunity to catch up  52  Johnson responded about one week later  concluding that the United States needed to do much more to reach a position of leadership  Johnson recommended that a piloted moon landing was far enough in the future that it was likely that the United States could achieve it first  53  On 25 May  Kennedy announced his support for the Apollo program and redefined the ultimate goal of the Space Race in an address to a special joint session of Congress  I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal  before this decade is out  of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth   54  His justification for the Moon Race  was that it was both vital to national security and it would focus the nation s energies in other scientific and social fields  51  He expressed his reasoning in the famous  We choose the Moon speech   on 12 September 1962  before a large crowd at Rice University Stadium  in Houston  Texas  near the site of the future Johnson Space Center  51   edit  Proposed Joint U S  U S S R  Moon Program On 20 September 1963  in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly  President Kennedy proposed that the United States and the Soviet Union join forces in their efforts to reach the moon  Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev initially rejected Kennedy s proposal  however during the next few weeks he concluded that both nations might realize cost benefits and technological gains from a joint venture  Khrushchev was poised to accept Kennedy s proposal at the time of Kennedy s assassination in November 1963   55  Khrushchev and Kennedy had developed a measure of rapport during their years as leaders of the world s two superpowers  especially during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis  That trust was lacking with Vice President Johnson  when Johnson assumed the Presidency after Kennedy s assassination  Khrushchev dropped the idea of a joint U S  U S S R  moon program  55   edit  Vostoks and Voskhods Vostok rocket displayed at Ostankino The Soviet Union achieved another first  with the first dual piloted flights  Vostok 3 and Vostok 4 on 11 15 August 1962  56  The two spacecraft came within approximately 6 5 kilometres  4 0 mi  of one another  close enough for radio communication  57  The launching of two spacecraft from the same pad during a very short period of time represented a significant technical accomplishment  however there was no capability for the spacecraft to maneuver closer to each other  and over the course of the mission they continued to drift as far as 2 850 kilometres  1 770 mi  apart  58  The Soviet Union achieved yet another first when it launched not only the first woman  but also the first civilian  in space   Valentina Tereshkova  on 16 June 1963  in Vostok 6  59  Launching a woman was reportedly Korolev s idea  and it was accomplished purely for propaganda value  59  Tereshkova was one of a small corps of female cosmonauts who were amateur parachutists  but Tereshkova was the only one to fly  59  The USSR didn t again open its cosmonaut corps to women until 1980  two years after the United States opened its astronaut corps to women  Korolev had planned further  long term missions for the Vostok spacecraft  and had four Vostoks in various stages of fabrication in late 1963 at his OKB 1 facilities  60  At that time  the Americans announced their ambitious plans for the Project Gemini flight schedule  These plans included major advancements in spacecraft capabilities  including a two person spacecraft  the ability to change orbits  the capacity to perform an extravehicular activity  EVA   and the goal of docking with another spacecraft  30  These represented major advances over the previous Mercury or Vostok spaceships  and Korolev felt the need to try to beat the Americans to many of these innovations  60  Korolev already had begun designing the Vostok s replacement  the next generation Soyuz spacecraft  a multi cosmonaut spacecraft that had at least the same capabilities as the Gemini spacecraft  61  However  Soyuz would not be available for at least three years  and it could not be called upon to deal with this new American challenge in 1964 or 1965  62  Political pressure in early 1964 which some sources claim was from Khrushchev while other sources claim was from other Communist Party officials pushed him to modify his four remaining Vostoks to beat the Americans to new space firsts in the size of flight crews  and the duration of missions  60  On 12 October 1964  the Chief Designer delivered another Soviet space first when Voskhod 1 launched the first multi person spacecraft  with three cosmonauts in a modified Vostok spacecraft  63  The USSR touted another technological achievement during this mission  it was the first space flight during which cosmonauts performed in a shirt sleeve environment  64  However  flying without spacesuits was not due to safety improvements in the Soviet spacecraft s environmental systems  rather this innovation was accomplished because the craft s limited cabin space did not allow for spacesuits  Flying without spacesuits exposed the cosmonauts to significant risk in the event of potentially fatal cabin depressurization  64  This feat would not be repeated until the US Apollo Command Module flew in 1968  this later mission was designed from the outset to safely transport three astronauts in a shirt sleeve environment while in space  Between 14 16 October 1964  Leonid Brezhnev and a small cadre of high ranking Communist Party officials  deposed Premier Khrushchev as Soviet government leader a day after Voskhod 1 landed  in what was called the  Wednesday conspiracy   65  The new political leaders  along with Korolev  ended the technologically troublesome Voskhod program  cancelling Voskhod 3 and 4  which were in the planning stages  and started concentrating on the race to the moon  66  Voskhod 2 would end up being Korolev s final achievement before his death  as it would become the last of the many space firsts that demonstrated the USSR s domination in spacecraft technology during the early 1960s  According to historian Asif Siddiqi  Korolev s accomplishments marked  the absolute zenith of the Soviet space program  one never  ever attained since   67  There would be a two year pause in Soviet piloted space flights while Voskhod s replacement  the Soyuz spacecraft  was designed and developed  68  The unmanned Zond 3 probe images the far side of the Moon in 1965 On 18 March 1965  about a week before the first American piloted Project Gemini space flight  the USSR accelerated the Space Race competition  by launching the two cosmonaut Voskhod 2 mission with Pavel Belyayev and Alexey Leonov  69  Voskhod 2 s design modifications included the first airlock to allow for extravehicular activity  EVA   also known as a spacewalk  70  Leonov performed the first ever EVA as part of the mission  69  A fatality was narrowly avoided when Leonov s spacesuit expanded in the vacuum of space  preventing him from re entering the spacecraft  71  He had to improvise  and perform the potentially fatal partial depressurization of his spacesuit in order to re enter the airlock  71  He succeeded in safely re entering the ship  but he and Belyayev faced further challenges when the spacecraft s atmospheric controls flooded the cabin with 45  pure oxygen  which had to be lowered to acceptable levels before re entry  72  The reentry involved two more challenges  an improperly timed retrorocket firing caused the Voskhod 2 to land 386 kilometres  240 mi  off its designated target area  the town of Perm  and the instrument compartment s failure to detach from the descent apparatus caused the spacecraft to become unstable during reentry  72   edit  Project Gemini Main article  Project Gemini Gemini 12 lifts off Focused by the commitment to a moon landing  in January 1962 the US introduced Project Gemini  a two crew member spacecraft that would support Apollo by developing the key spaceflight technologies of space rendezvous and docking of two craft  flight durations of sufficient length to simulate going to the Moon and back  Extra vehicular Activity for extended periods  and accomplishing useful work rather than just  walking in space   Although Gemini took a year longer than planned to accomplish its first flight  Gemini took advantage of the USSR s two year hiatus after Voskhod  which enabled the US to catch up and surpass the previous Soviet lead in piloted spaceflight  Gemini achieved several significant firsts during the course of ten piloted missions  On Gemini 3  March 1965   astronauts Virgil  Gus  Grissom and John W  Young became the first to demonstrate their ability to change their craft s orbit  On Gemini 5  August 1965   astronauts L  Gordon Cooper and Charles  Pete  Conrad set a record of almost eight days in space  long enough for a piloted lunar mission  On Gemini 6A  December 1965   Command Pilot Wally Schirra achieved the first space rendezvous with Gemini 7  accurately matching his orbit to that of the other craft  station keeping at distances as close as1 foot  0 30 m   and keeping station for three consecutive orbits  73  Gemini 7 also set a human spaceflight endurance record of fourteen days for Frank Borman and James A  Lovell  which stood until both nations started launching space laboratories in the early 1970s  On Gemini 8  March 1966   Command Pilot Neil Armstrong achieved the first docking between two spacecraft  his Gemini craft and an Agena target vehicle  Gemini 11  September 1966   commanded by Conrad  achieved the first direct ascent rendezvous with its Agena target on the first orbit  and used the Agena s rocket to achieve an apogee of 742 nautical miles  1 374 km   an earth orbit record never broken as of 23 March 2012 T 12 13 UTC   On Gemini 12  November 1966   Edwin E   Buzz  Aldrin spent over five hours working comfortably during three  EVA  sessions  finally proving that humans could perform productive tasks outside their spacecraft   This proved to be the most difficult goal to achieve   Most of the novice pilots on the early missions would command the later missions  In this way  Project Gemini built up spaceflight experience for the pool of astronauts who would be chosen to fly the Apollo lunar missions   edit  Soviet Moon program Main article  Soviet Moonshot Lunniy Korabl  LK  The Soviet Union had planned to divide their lunar program into two separate manned programs  circumlunar flights in 1967 and lunar landings from 1968  The circumlunar missions were to be launched by a UR 500 rocket  later known as the Proton  The cosmonauts would be flown to the Moon in the Soyuz 7K L1  Zond   which made four unsuccessful unmanned flights from 1967 1970  One flight of the Zond was  however  successful and returned its non human passengers  tortoises  to earth  had it been used for a manned circumlunar mission  the flight would have carried two cosmonauts  The Soviet lunar landing missions would use spacecraft derived from the Soyuz 7K L1  The orbital module  Soyuz 7K L3   the  Lunniy Orbitalny Korabl   LOK   had a crew of two  The LOK and a separate lunar lander  the  Lunniy Korabl   LK   had 40  of the mass of the Apollo CSM LM due to the launch vehicle s capabilities  The launch vehicle would have been the N1 rocket  which was roughly the same height and takeoff mass as the American Saturn V  exceeded its takeoff thrust by 28   yet had roughly half the TLI payload capability  The N1 was unsuccessfully tested four times  exploding each time due to problems with the first stage s thirty engines  The Soviet leadership cancelled the program in 1970 after the first two successful American Moon landings   edit  Fatalities and disasters of the 1960s Likely the worst disaster during the Space Race was the Soviet Union s Nedelin catastrophe in 1960  74  It happened on 24 October 1960  when Chief Marshal Mitrofan Nedelin gave orders to use improper shutdown and control procedures on an experimental R 16 rocket  74  The hasty on pad repairs caused the missile s second stage engine to fire straight onto the full propellant tanks of the still attached first stage  74  The resulting explosion  toxic fuel spill and fire  killed anywhere from 92 to 150 top Soviet military and technical personnel  74  Marshal Nedelin was vaporized  and his only identifiable remains were his war medals  especially the Gold Star of the Soviet Union  74  His death was officially explained as an airplane crash  74  It was also a huge set back for the rocket s chief designer  Mikhail Yangel  who was trying to unseat Korolev as the person responsible for the Soviet human spaceflight program  74  75  Yangel survived only because he went for a cigarette break in a bunker that was removed from the launch pad  but he would not rival Korolev during the rest of this period  74  The Nedelin catastrophe would remain an official secret until 1989  and the survivors of the incident were not allowed to discuss it until 1990  thirty one years after it occurred  76  In 1986  in a series of newspaper articles in Izvestia  it was disclosed for the first time that the USSR had officially covered up the 23 March 1961 death of Soviet cosmonaut Valentin Bondarenko from massive third degree burns from a fire in a high oxygen isolation test chamber  77  This revelation subsequently caused some speculation as to whether the Apollo 1 disaster might have been averted had NASA been aware of the incident  78  Bondarenko  at age 24  was the youngest of the early Vostok cosmonauts  79  The Soviet government literally erased all traces of Bondarenko s existence in the cosmonaut corps upon his death  80  In 1967  both nations faced serious challenges that brought their programs to a halt  Both nations had been rushing at full speed on the Apollo and Soyuz programs  without paying due diligence to growing design and manufacturing problems  The results proved fatal to both pioneering crews  In the United States  the first Apollo mission crew  Command Pilot  Gus  Grissom  Senior Pilot Ed White  and Pilot Roger Chaffee  were killed by suffocation in a cabin fire that swept through their Apollo 1 spacecraft during a ground test on 27 January 1967  The fire was probably caused by an electrical spark  and it grew out of control  fed by the spacecraft s pure oxygen atmosphere maintained at greater than normal atmospheric pressure  81  An investigative board detailed design and construction flaws in the spacecraft  and procedural failings including failure to appreciate the hazard of the pure oxygen atmosphere as well as inadequate safety procedures  81  All these flaws had to be corrected over the next twenty two months until the first piloted flight could be made  81  Mercury and Gemini veteran Gus Grissom had been a favored choice of Deke Slayton  the grounded Mercury astronaut who became NASA s Director of Flight Crew Operations  to make the first piloted landing  Meanwhile  the Soviet Union was having its own problems with Soyuz development  Engineers reported 200 design faults to party leaders  but their concerns  were overruled by political pressures for a series of space feats to mark the anniversary of Lenin s birthday   On April 24  1967  the USSR suffered the death of its first cosmonaut  Colonel Vladimir Komarov  the single pilot of Soyuz 1  This was planned to be a three day mission to include the first Soviet docking with an unpiloted Soyuz 2  but his mission was plagued with problems  Early on his craft lacked sufficient electrical power because only one of two solar panels had deployed  Then the automatic attitude control system began malfunctioning and eventually failed completely  resulting in the craft spinning wildly  Komarov was able to stop the spin with the manual system  which was only partially effective  The flight controllers aborted his mission after only one day  and he made an emergency re entry  During re entry a fault in the landing parachute system caused the primary chutes to fail  and the reserve chutes tangled together  Komarov was killed on impact  Fixing these  and other  spacecraft faults caused an eighteen month delay before piloted Soyuz flights could resume  similar to the US experience with Apollo  This  combined with Korolev s death  led to the quick unraveling of the Soviet Moon landing program  Other astronauts died while training for space flight  including four Americans  Ted Freeman  Elliot See  Charlie Bassett  Clifton Williams   who all died in crashes of T 38 aircraft  Yuri Gagarin  the first man in space  met a similar fate in 1968  when he crashed in a MiG 15 jet while training for a Soyuz mission  During the Apollo 15 mission in August 1971  the astronauts left behind a memorial in honor of all the people  both from the Soviet Union and the United States  who had perished during efforts to reach the moon  This included the Apollo 1 and Soyuz 1 crews  as well as astronauts and cosmonauts killed while in training  In 1971  Soyuz 11 cosmonauts Georgi Dobrovolski  Viktor Patsayev  and Vladislav Volkov asphyxiated during reentry  Since 1971  the Soviet Russian space program has suffered no additional losses   edit  To the Moon The United States recovered from the Apollo 1 fire  fixing the fatal flaws in an improved version of the Block II command module  The US proceeded with unpiloted test launches of the Saturn V launch vehicle  Apollo 4 and Apollo 6  and the Lunar Module  Apollo 5  during the latter half of 1967 and early 1968  82  Apollo 1 s mission to check out the Apollo Command Service Module in Earth orbit was accomplished by Grissom s backup crew commanded by Walter Schirra on Apollo 7  launched on 11 October 1968  83  The eleven day mission was a total success  as the spacecraft performed a virtually flawless mission  paving the way for the United States to continue with its lunar mission schedule  84  The Soviet Union also fixed the parachute and control problems with Soyuz  and the next piloted mission Soyuz 3 was launched on 26 October 1968  85  The goal was to complete Komarov s rendezvous and docking mission with the un piloted Soyuz 2  85  Ground controllers brought the two craft to within 200 metres  660 ft  of each other  then cosmonaut Georgy Beregovoy took control  85  He got within 40 metres  130 ft  of his target  but was unable to dock before expending 90 percent of his maneuvering fuel  due to a piloting error that put his spacecraft into the wrong orientation and forced Soyuz 2 to automatically turn away from his approaching craft  85  The Soviet Zond spacecraft was almost ready for piloted circumlunar missions in 1968  although testing was not yet complete  At the time  the Soyuz 7K L1 Zond spacecraft was not yet ready for piloted missions after five unsuccessful and partially successful automated test launches  Cosmos 146 on 10 March 1967  Cosmos 154 on 8 April 1967  Zond 1967A 27 September 1967  Zond 1967B on 22 November 1967  86 Zond 4 was launched on 2 March 1968  and successfully made a circumlunar flight  87  After its successful flight around the Moon  Zond 4 encountered problems with its Earth reentry on 9 March  and was ordered destroyed by an explosive charge 15 000 metres  49 000 ft  over the Gulf of Guinea  88  The Soviet official announcement said that Zond 4 was an automated test flight which ended with its intentional destruction  due to its recovery trajectory positioning it over the Atlantic Ocean instead of over the USSR  87  Earthrise  as seen from Apollo 8  December 24  1968  NASA  During the summer of 1968  the Apollo program hit another snag  the first pilot rated Lunar Module  LM  was not ready for orbital tests in time for a December 1968 launch  NASA planners overcame this challenge by changing the mission flight order  delaying the first LM flight until early 1969  and sending Apollo 8 into lunar orbit without the LM in December on a new  C prime  mission  89  This mission was in part motivated by intelligence rumors the Soviet Union might fly a piloted circumlunar Zond flight during late 1968  90  In September 1968  Zond 5  a Soyuz 7K L1 spacecraft  with tortoises on board  made a circumlunar flight and returned to Earth  accomplishing the first successful splashdown of the Soviet space program  in the Indian Ocean  91  It also scared NASA planners  as it took them several days to figure out that it was only an automated flight  not a piloted flight with cosmonauts  because voice recordings were transmitted from the craft en route to the Moon  92  On 10 November 1968 another automated test flight of the 7K L1 spacecraft   Zond 6   was launched  but this time  it encountered difficulties in its Earth reentry  and depressurized and deployed its parachute too early  causing it to crash land only 16 kilometres  10 mi  from where it had been launched six days earlier  93  Apollo 8 launched on 21 December 1968  and became the first human crewed spacecraft to leave low Earth orbit and go to another celestial body  the Moon  94  On 24 December Frank Borman  Jim Lovell  and Bill Anders became the first humans to enter into orbit around the Moon  94  They orbited ten times  and transmitted one of the most watched TV broadcasts in history  with their Christmas Eve program from lunar orbit  that concluded with a reading from the King James Bible s Book of Genesis  94  A few hours later  the crew performed the first ever Trans Earth injection  TEI  burn  to blast the Apollo 8 spacecraft out of lunar orbit and on to a trajectory back to the Earth  94  Just over two days later  on 27 December  Apollo 8 safely splashed down in the Pacific  completing another first  NASA s first dawn splashdown and recovery  94  It turned out there was no chance of a piloted Soviet circumlunar flight during 1968  due to the unreliability of the Zonds  95  After the successive launch failures of the N1 rocket in 1969  Soviet plans for a piloted landing suffered first delay and ultimately cancellation  96  The launch pad explosion of the N 1 on 3 July 1969 was a significant setback  97  The rocket hit the pad after an engine shutdown  destroying itself and the launch facility  97   edit  Apollo 11 Main article  Apollo 11 American Buzz Aldrin during the first moonwalk in 1969 1969 saw the final leg of the Moon Race  with the United States leading it after the flight of Apollo 8  95  Unbeknownst to the Americans  the Soviet moon program was in deep trouble  95  Without the N 1 rocket  the Soviets had no way to land on the Moon  98  The next two Apollo missions proved that the Lunar Module worked well  both in low Earth orbit and in lunar orbit  It was time to proceed to an actual landing mission  99  Under this backdrop  Apollo 11 was being prepared for a July encounter with the Moon  100  The Apollo 11 crew consisted of commander  CDR  Neil Armstrong  command module pilot  CMP  Michael Collins  and lunar module pilot  LMP  Edwin  Buzz  Aldrin  101  They were selected as the crew in January 1969  and they trained for the mission until just before the actual launch day  102  On 16 July 1969  at exactly 9 32 a m  EDT  the Saturn V rocket   serial number SA 506   lifted off from Launch Complex 39A  with Apollo 11 on board  103  The lunar trip took just over three days  104  After achieving orbit  Armstrong and Aldrin transferred into the Lunar Module  named Eagle  and began their descent  After overcoming several computer malfunctions  Armstrong took over manual flight control at about 180 metres  590 ft   and guided the Lunar Module to a landing on the Moon s Sea of Tranquility at 4 17 p m  EDT  20 July 1969  The first humans on the Moon would wait another six hours before they ventured out of their craft  At 10 56 15 p m  EDT  Armstrong became the first human to set foot on the Moon  105  Neil Armstrong s historic first words on the Moon  File Neil Armstrong small step wav  That s one small step for man  one giant leap for mankind   Problems listening to this file  See media help  The first step was witnessed by at least 500 million TV viewers back on Earth  106  His first words when he stepped off the LM s landing pad were   That s one small step for  a  man  one giant leap for mankind   105  Aldrin joined him on the surface almost 20 minutes later  107  Altogether  they spent just under two and one quarter hours outside their craft  108  The next day  they performed the first launch from another celestial body  and rendezvoused with the Columbia Command Module  109  Apollo 11 safely blasted out of Moon orbit on its way back to a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean on 24 July 1969  110  When the spacecraft splashed down  2 982 days had passed since Kennedy committed the United States to landing a man on the moon and bringing him back safely to the Earth before the end of the decade  the mission was completed with just 161 days to spare  111  With the safe completion of the Apollo 11 mission  the Americans won the race to the Moon  112  Additional landing included Apollo 12  Apollo 14  Apollo 15  Apollo 16  and Apollo 17   edit  The 1970s Apollo 17 s Saturn V in 1972 Moonwalk  December 13  1972  The early 1970s were rounded out by several more U S  manned Moon landings  which featured expanded tasks including more sample returns  experiments  and extended EVAs with a lunar rover  The USSR continued for time with their N1 rocket  as well as more Soyuz flights to their Salyut stations  Unmanned spacecraft were in the limelight as well  with the USSR launching unmanned lunar sample return missions and probes to Mars and Venus  The US launched probes to Mars  Venus  Mercury  Jupiter  Saturn  and beyond  as well as launching Skylab  a orbital space station  Together  the US and Soviet conducted an orbital rendezvous by manned spacecraft in 1975  By the end of the 1970s  both were working on Space Shuttles and launching science missions at a fever pitch   edit  Salyuts and Skylab Having lost the race to the moon  the USSR decided to concentrate on orbital space stations  During 1969 and 1970  they launched six more Soyuz flights after Soyuz 3  then launched the first space station  the Salyut 1 laboratory designed by Kerim Kerimov  on 19 April 1971  Three days later  the Soyuz 10 crew attempted to dock with it  but failed to achieve a secure enough connection to safely enter the station  The Soyuz 11 crew of Vladislav Volkov  Georgi Dobrovolski and Viktor Patsayev successfully docked on 7 June and completed a record 22 day stay  The crew became the second in flight space fatality during their reentry on 30 June  They were asphyxiated when their spacecraft s cabin lost all pressure  shortly after undocking  The disaster was blamed on a faulty cabin pressure valve  that allowed all the air to vent into space  The crew were not wearing pressure suits and had no chance of survival once the leak occurred  Salyut 1 s orbit was increased to prevent premature reentry  but further piloted flights were delayed while the Soyuz was redesigned to fix the new safety problem  The station re entered the Earth s atmosphere on 11 October  after 175 days in orbit  The USSR attempted to launch a second Salyut class station designated Durable Orbital Station 2  DOS 2  on 29 July 1972  but a rocket failure caused it to fail to achieve orbit  After the DOS 2 failure  the USSR attempted to launch four more Salyut class stations through 1975  with another failure due to an explosion of the final rocket stage  which punctured the station with shrapnel so that it wouldn t hold pressure  While all of the Salyuts were presented to the public as non military scientific laboratories  some of them were actually covers for the military Almaz reconnaissance stations  The United States also had plans to launch a piloted space laboratory as part of the Apollo Applications Program  using Apollo hardware  The original plans called for constructing the space laboratory using a spent Saturn S IVB rocket stage  used to launch the Apollo craft into earth orbit   however the space laboratory was ultimately pre fabricated on Earth and launched by the modified first two stages of the Saturn V lunar launch vehicle  known as the Saturn INT 21  The orbital workstation Skylab  weighed 169 950 pounds  77 090 kg   was 58 feet  18 m  long by 21 7 feet  6 6 m  in diameter  with a habitable volume of 10 000 cubic feet  280 m3   Skylab 1  the mission to actually launch the space station  was launched on 14 May 1973  but was damaged during the flight  losing one of its solar panels and a meteoroid thermal shield  Subsequent human crewed missions repaired the station  and the final mission s crew  Skylab 4  set the Space Race endurance record with 84 days in orbit  when the mission ended on 8 February 1974  Skylab stayed in orbit another five years before reentering the Earth s atmosphere over the Indian Ocean and Western Australia on 11 July 1979   edit  Apollo Soyuz Test Mission Apollo Soyuz crew  From left to right  Donald  Deke  Slayton  Thomas Patten Stafford  Vance Brand  Alexey Leonov  and Valeri Kubasov  While the Sputnik 1 launch can be called the start of the Space Race  its end is harder to pinpoint  In May 1972  President Richard M  Nixon and Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev negotiated an easing of relations known as detente  creating a temporary  thaw  in the Cold War  In the spirit of good sportsmanship  the time seemed right for cooperation rather than competition  and the notion of a continuing  race  began to subside  The two nations planned a joint mission to dock the last US Apollo craft with a Soyuz  known as the Apollo Soyuz Test Project  ASTP   To prepare  the US designed a docking module for the Apollo 11 that was compatible with the Soviet docking system  which allowed any of their craft to dock with any other  e g  Soyuz Soyuz as well as Soyuz Salyut   The module was also necessary as an airlock to allow the men to visit each other s craft  which had incompatible cabin atmospheres  The USSR used the Soyuz 16 mission in December 1974 to prepare for ASTP  The joint mission began when Soyuz 19 was first launched on 15 July 1975 at 12 20 UTC  and the Apollo craft was launched with the docking module six and a half hours later  The two craft rendezvoused and docked on July 17 at 16 19 UTC  The three astronauts conducted joint experiments with the two cosmonauts  and the crew shook hands  exchanged gifts  and visited each other s craft   edit  After Apollo In the 1970s  the United States began developing a new generation of reusable orbital spacecraft known as the Space Shuttle  and launched a range of unmanned probes  The USSR continued to develop space station technology with the Salyut program and Mir   Peace  or  Earth   space station  supported by Soyuz spacecraft  They developed their own large space shuttle under the Buran program  However  the USSR ended around 1991 and the remains of its space program were distributed to various Eastern European countries  The United States and Russia would work together in space with the Shuttle Mir Program  and again with the International Space Station   edit  Retrospectives Mir  amp  Atlantis    1995 The meaning and nature of the space race are subject to periodic retrospectives in American and other cultures  One such occurrence was in 2003 when Columbia was lost with crew during re entry  113  Some more retrospectives took place with retirement of the U S  Space Shuttle program in 2011 and the cancellation of Project Constellation in 2010  114  115   edit  Legacy  edit  Advances in technology and education Technology especially in aerospace engineering  electronics and telecommunication fields advanced greatly during this period  However  the effects of the Space Race went far beyond rocketry  physics  and astronomy   Space age technology  extended to fields as diverse as home economics citation needed  and forest defoliation studies  and the push to win the race changed the very nature of science education  American concerns that they had fallen behind the Soviet Union in the race to space led quickly to a push by legislators and educators for greater emphasis on mathematics and the physical sciences in American schools  The United States  National Defense Education Act of 1958 increased funding for these goals from childhood education through the post graduate level  To this day over 1 200 American high schools retain their own planetarium installations  a situation unparalleled in any other country citation needed  and a direct consequence of the Space Race citation needed   The scientists educated through these efforts helped develop technologies that have been adapted for use in the kitchen  in transportation systems  in athletics  and in many other areas of modern life  Dried fruits and ready to eat foods  in

crews to and from the station   edit  The Environment An unintended consequence of the Space Race is that it facilitated the environmental movement  as this was the first time in history that humans could see their home world as it really appears  the first color pictures from space showed a fragile blue planet bordered by the blackness of space  116  Pictures such as Apollo 8 s Earthrise  which showed a crescent Earth peeking over the lunar surface  and Apollo 17 s The Blue Marble  which for the first time ever showed a full circular earth  became iconic to the environmental movement  116  The first Earth Day was partially triggered by the Apollo 8 photo  117  Astronauts returning from space missions also commented on how fragile the Earth looked from space  further fueling calls for better stewardship of the only home humans have for now  118   edit  See also Spaceflight portal Moon Shot List of space exploration milestones  1957 1969 Spaceflight records Timeline of space
