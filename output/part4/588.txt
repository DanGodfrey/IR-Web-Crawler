Census Bureau The Midwestern United States as defined by the United States Census Bureau  is one of the four U S  geographic regions  1  Though it is geographically in the north  and more eastern than western  the term refers to the fact that the region is midway to the opposite coast when heading directly west from New England and New York  where the term originated  The area is now called the Midwest throughout the English speaking world  The region consists of 12 states in the north central and north eastern United States  Illinois  Indiana  Iowa  Kansas  Michigan  Minnesota  Missouri  Nebraska  North Dakota  Ohio  South Dakota and Wisconsin  1  A 2010 United States Census put the population at 66 927 001  Both the population center and the geographic center of the contiguous United States are in the Midwest  in Missouri and Kansas  respectively  Chicago is the largest city in the region  followed by Indianapolis  Columbus  Detroit  and Milwaukee  Chicago and its suburbs form the largest metropolitan statistical area  followed by Metro Detroit  the Twin Cities  Greater Cleveland  Metro St  Louis and Kansas City area  2 Sault Ste  Marie  Michigan  is the oldest city in the region  having been founded by French missionaries and explorers in 1668  The term Midwestern has been in use since the 1880s to refer to portions of the central U S  3  A variant term   Middle West   has been in use since the 19th century and remains relatively common  4  Another term sometimes applied to the same general region is  the heartland   5  Other designations for the region have fallen out of use  such as the  Northwest  or  Old Northwest   from  Northwest Territory   and  Mid America   The four westernmost states of the Midwest the Dakotas  Kansas and Nebraska were in the late 19th century very much part of the  Old West   Since the book Middletown appeared in 1929  sociologists once used Midwestern cities  and the Midwest generally  as  typical  of the entire nation  however coastal cities are now considered the epicenter of American culture often portrayed in the media  6  7  The region has a higher employment to population ratio  the percentage of employed people at least 16 years old  than the Northeast  the West  the South  or the Sun Belt states  most probably due to the region s relatively smaller populations  8  The U S  Census Bureau further divides the Midwest into two distinct regions  the East North Central  Great Lakes States   which include Michigan  Ohio  Indiana  Illinois  and Wisconsin  Midwestern states that come in contact with a Great Lake   and the West North Central  Great Plains States   which include Iowa  Minnesota  Missouri  North Dakota  South Dakota  Nebraska  and Kansas  states that are located within the Great Plains region of

unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Traditional definitions of the Midwest include the Northwest Ordinance  Old Northwest  states and many states that were part of the Louisiana Purchase  The states of the Old Northwest are also known as  Great Lakes states   Many of the Louisiana Purchase states are also known as  Great Plains states   The Midwest Region is defined by the U S  Census Bureau as these 12 states  Illinois  Old Northwest  Ohio River  and Great Lakes state  Indiana  Old Northwest  Ohio River  and Great Lakes state  Iowa  Louisiana Purchase  Kansas

Wisconsin  Old Northwest and Great Lakes state  The Midwest Region of the National Park Service consists of these twelve states as well as Arkansas   edit  Physical geography Typical terrain of the Driftless Area as viewed from Wildcat Mountain State Park in Vernon County  Wisconsin  The vast central area of the U S   into Canada  is a landscape of low  flat to rolling terrain in the Interior Plains  Most of its eastern two thirds form the Interior Lowlands  The Lowlands gradually rise westward  from a line passing through eastern Kansas  up to 5 000  feet in the unit known as the Great Plains   Much of the Plains are now converted land use wise to farming  9  While these states are for the most part relatively flat  consisting either of plains or of rolling and small hills  there is a measure of geographical variation  In particular  the eastern Midwest near the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains  the Great Lakes Basin  the Ozark Mountains of southern Missouri  the rugged topography of Southern Indiana and far Southern Illinois  and the Driftless Area of northwest Illinois  southwest Wisconsin  southeast Minnesota  and northeast Iowa exhibit a high degree of topographical variety  Proceeding westward  the Appalachian Plateau topography gradually gives way to gently rolling hills and then  in central Ohio  to flat lands converted principally to farms and urban areas  This is the beginning of the vast Interior Plains of North America  As a result  prairies cover most of the states west of the Mississippi River with the exception of taiga clad northern Minnesota  Illinois lies within an area called the  prairie peninsula   an eastward extension of prairies that borders deciduous forests to the north  east  and south  Prairie in Effigy Mounds National Monument  Iowa  Geographers subdivide the Interior Plains into the Interior Lowlands and the Great Plains on the basis of elevation  The Lowlands are mostly below 1 500 feet above sealevel whereas the Great Plains to the west are higher  rising in Colorado to around 5 000 feet  The Lowlands  then  are confined to parts of Minnesota  Iowa  Michigan  Ohio  Indiana  Tennessee  and Kentucky  Missouri and Arkansas have regions of Lowlands elevations but in the Ozarks  within the Interior Highlands  are higher  Those familiar with the topography of eastern Ohio may be confused by this  that region is hilly but its rocks are horizontal and are an extension of the Appalachian Plateau  The Interior Plains are largely coincident with the vast Mississippi River Drainage System  other major components are the Missouri and Ohio Rivers   These rivers have for tens of millions of years been eroding downward into the mostly horizontal sedimentary rocks of Paleozoic  Mesozoic  and Cenozoic ages  The modern Mississippi River system has developed during the Pleistocen Epoch of the Cenozoic Eraut its rocks are horizontal and are an extension of the Appalachian Plateau  9  Rainfall decreases from east to west  resulting in different types of prairies  with the tallgrass prairie in the wetter eastern region  mixed grass prairie in the central Great Plains  and shortgrass prairie towards the rain shadow of the Rockies  Today  these three prairie types largely correspond to the corn soybean area  the wheat belt  and the western rangelands  respectively  Although hardwood forests in the northern Midwest were clear cut in the late 19th century  they were replaced by new growth  Ohio and Michigan s forests are still growing  The majority of the Midwest can now be categorized as urbanized areas or pastoral agricultural areas   edit  Prehistory American Indians came to North America through the Beringia land bridge between Asia and North America anywhere from 12 000 to 100 000 years ago  According to the study of ancient Indian skulls by scientists  these people display affinities with populations as diverse as the Ainu of Japan  peoples of central Asia  Australasia  India  southwest Asia  and the Neandertals of Europe  Prior to European colonization in North America  Native Americans had developed a large population in this vast land  estimated as between 1 million to 18 million  scattered across all of North America  There were many different tribes which belong to several main cultures and societies  In Midwestern America  the American Indians had experienced three main periods before the arrival of Europeans in the 17th century  Paleoindian cultures was the earliest one  occupied North America  with some restricted to the Great Plains and Great Lakes of the modern United States and Canada  as well as adjacent areas to the west and southwest from about 12 000 B C  to around 8 000 B C  These people moved into North America when the continental glaciers of the last great ice age  the Wisconsin glacier period  began to melt  Following the Paleo Indian period is the Archaic period  8 000 B C  to 1 000 B C    the Woodland Tradition  1 000 B C  to 100 A D    and the Mississippi Period  900 to 1600 A D    Archeological evidence indicates that Mississippi culture probably began in the St  Louis  Missouri area and spread northwest along the Mississippi and Illinois rivers and entered the state along the Kankakee River system  It also spread northward into Indiana along the Wabash  Tippecanoe  and White Rivers  10  Monks Mound  located at the Cahokia Mounds UNESCO World Heritage Site near Collinsville  Illinois  is the largest Pre Columbian earthwork in America north of Mesoamerica  The Mississippi period was characterized by a mound building culture  The namesake cultural trait of the mound builders was their construction of large  truncated earthwork pyramid mounds  or platform mounds  and other earthworks  These burial and ceremonial structures were typically flat topped pyramids or platform mounds  flat topped or rounded cones  elongated ridges  and sometimes a variety of other forms  Domestic houses  temples  burial buildings were usually constructed on the tops of such mounds  Prehistoric mounds are common from the plains of the Midwest to the Atlantic seaboard  but only in this general area was there a culture that regularly constructed mounds in the shape of mammals  birds  or reptiles  Among the most well known are found at Effigy Mounds National Monument in northeastern Iowa  the largest known collection of mounds in the United States  11  The monument contains 2 526 acres  10 22 km2  with 206 mounds of which 31 are effigies  The others are conical  linear and compound  Woodland period Indians built mounds from about 500 BC until the early European contact period  When the American prairies were plowed under by European settlers for agriculture  many mound sites were lost  They were built as part of complex villages that attracted more dense populations  with a specialization of skills and knowledge  The best known  flat topped pyramidal structure  which at over 100 feet  30 m  tall is the largest pre Columbian earthwork north of Mexico  is Monks Mound at Cahokia Indian Mounds in Collinsville  Illinois  The mound builders included many different tribal groups and chiefdoms  involving an array of beliefs and unique cultures over thousands of years  The general term covered their shared architectural practice of earthwork mound construction  This practice  believed to be associated with a cosmology that had a cross cultural appeal  may indicate common cultural antecedents  Mississippi Mound tribes in the Midwest were mostly farmers who followed the rich  flat floodplains of Midwestern rivers  They brought with them a well developed agricultural complex based on three major crops   maize  beans  and squash  Maize  or corn  was the primary crop of Mississippi farmers  They gathered a wide variety of seeds  nuts  and berries  and fished and hunted for fowl to supplement their diets  With such an intensive form of agriculture  Mississippi Mound culture supported a large Indian population   edit  History  edit  American Indian  edit  Great Lakes Indians The Great Lakes region  stretching from New York to Minnesota   has played a vital role in the lives and histories of Native American peoples who have resided along their shores for millennia  Tribes living around the Great Lakes area included the Hurons  Ottawa  Chippewas or Ojibwas  Potawatomis  Winnebago  Ho chunk   Menominees  Sacs  Neutrals  Fox  and the Miami  Most numerous were the Hurons and Chippewas  Fighting and battle were often launched between tribes  with some tribes forced to move around  Most Indian groups living in the Great Lakes region for the last five centuries are of the Algonquian language family  Some tribes such as the Stockbridge Munsee and the Brothertown  are also Algonkian speaking tribes who relocated from the eastern seaboard to the Great Lakes region in the 19th century  The Oneida belong to the Iroquois language group and the Ho Chunk of Wisconsin are one of the few Great Lakes tribes to speak a Siouan language  12  American Indians in this area did not develop a written form of language  Winnebago family  1852  In the 16th century  American Indians used projectiles and tools of stone  bone  and wood to hunt and farm  They could made canoes for fishing  Most of them lived in oval or conical wigwams that could be easily moved away  Various tribes had different ways of living  The Ojibwas were primarily hunters and fishing was also important in the Ojibwas economy  Other tribes such as Sac  Fox  and Miami  who wandered in the south and southwestern section of the Great Lakes region  both hunted and farmed to make their living  They were oriented toward the open prairies where they engaged in communal hunts for buffalo  In the northern forests  the Ottawas and Potawatomis separated into small family groups for hunting  The Winnebagos and Menominees used both hunting methods interchangeably and built up widespread trade networks extending as far west as the Rockies  north to the Great Lakes  south to the Gulf of Mexico  and east to the Atlantic Ocean  The Hurons reckoned descent through the female line  while the others favored the patrilineal method  All tribes were governed under chiefdoms or complex chiefdoms  For example  Hurons were divided into matrilineal clans  each represented by a chief in the town council  where they met with a town chief on civic matters  But Chippewa people s social and political life was simpler than that of settled tribes  The religious beliefs varied among tribes  Hurons believed in Yoscaha  a supernatural being who lived in the sky and was believed to have created the world and the Huron people  At death  Hurons thought the soul left the body to live in a village in the sky  Chippewas were a deeply religious people who believed in the Great Spirit  They worshipped the Great Spirit through all their seasonal activities and viewed religion as a private matter  each person s relation with his personal guardian spirit was part of his thinking every day of life  Ottawa and Potawatomi people had very similar religious beliefs to that of the Chippewas  10   edit  Great Plains Indians Young Oglala Lakota girl in front of tipi with puppy beside her  probably on or near Pine Ridge Indian Reservation  South Dakota  The Plains Indians are the indigenous peoples who live on the plains and rolling hills of the Great Plains of North America  Their colorful equestrian culture and resistance to white domination have made the Plains Indians archetypical in literature and art for American Indians everywhere  Plains Indians are usually divided into two broad classifications which overlap to some degree  The first group were fully nomadic  following the vast herds of buffalo  Some tribes occasionally engaged in agriculture  growing tobacco and corn primarily  These included the Blackfoot  Arapaho  Assiniboine  Cheyenne  Comanche  Crow  Gros Ventre  Kiowa  Lakota  Lipan  Plains Apache  or Kiowa Apache   Plains Cree  Plains Ojibwe  Sarsi  Shoshone  Stoney  and Tonkawa  The second group of Plains Indians  sometimes referred to as Prairie Indians  were the semi sedentary tribes who  in addition to hunting buffalo  lived in villages and raised crops  These included the Arikara  Hidatsa  Iowa  Kaw  or Kansa   Kitsai  Mandan  Missouria  Nez Perce  Omaha  Osage  Otoe  Pawnee  Ponca  Quapaw  Santee  Wichita  and Yankton  The nomadic tribes of the Great Plains survived on hunting  and the bison was their main source of food  Some tribes are described as part of the  Buffalo Culture   sometimes called  for the American Bison   Although the Plains Indians hunted other animals  such as elk or antelope  bison was the primary game food source and the chief source for items which Plains Indians made from their flesh  hide and bones  such as food  cups  decorations  crafting tools  knives  and clothing   See Bison hunting   The tribes followed the seasonal grazing and migration of bison  The Plains Indians lived in teepees because they were easily disassembled and allowed the nomadic life of following game  When Spanish horses were obtained  the Plains tribes rapidly integrated them into their daily lives  By the early 18th century  many tribes had fully adopted a horse culture  Before their adoption of guns  the Plains Indians hunted with spears  bows  and bows and arrows  and various forms of clubs  The use of horses by the Plains Indians made hunting  and warfare  much easier  13  Among the most powerful and dominant tribes were the Dakota or Sioux  who occupied large amounts of territory in the Great Plains of the Midwest  The area of the Great Sioux Nation spread throughout the South and Midwest  up into the areas of Minnesota and stretching out west into the Rocky Mountains  At the same time  they occupied the heart of prime buffalo range and also an excellent region for furs which could be sold to French and American traders for goods such as guns  The Sioux  Dakota  became the most powerful of the Plains tribes and the greatest threat to American expansion  14  15  The Sioux comprise three major divisions based on Siouan dialect and subculture  Is  yathi or Is  athi   Knife   originating from the name of a lake in present day Minnesota   residing in the extreme east of the Dakotas  Minnesota and northern Iowa  and are often referred to as the Santee or Eastern Dakota  Ih  kt u wa  and Ih  kt u wa na   Village at the end  and  little village at the end    residing in the Minnesota River area  they are considered to be the middle Sioux  and are often referred to as the Yankton and the Yanktonai  or  collectively  as the Wi h yena  endonym  or the Western Dakota  and have been erroneously classified as  Nakota  16    Th t u wa  or Teton  uncertain  perhaps  Dwellers on the Prairie   this name is archaic among the natives  who prefer to call themselves Lak  ta 17    the westernmost Sioux  known for their hunting and warrior culture  are often referred to as the Lakota  The Plains Indians followed no single religion  Animist religion was an important part of a Great Plains Indians  life  as they believed that all things possessed spirits  Their worship was centered on one main god  in the Sioux language Wakan Tanka  the Great Spirit   The Great Spirit had power over everything that had ever existed  and the Plains Indians believed that by worshiping him they would become stronger  Earth was also quite important  as she was the mother of all spirits  Spirits were worshiped daily  People sometimes prayed alone  while other times there were group gatherings  The most important group ceremony was the Sun Dance  in which participants danced for four days around a sacred object  and some would inflict harm upon themselves on purpose  all while staring at the sun  They believed this self sacrifice would encourage powerful spirits to support and defend them  Today  the Sioux maintain many separate tribal governments scattered across several reservations  communities  and reserves in the Dakotas  Nebraska  Minnesota  and Montana in the United States  and Manitoba and southern Saskatchewan in Canada   edit  Exploration and early settlement  edit  New France European settlement of the area began in the 17th century following French exploration of the region and became known as New France  the area colonized by France in North America during a period beginning with the exploration of the Saint Lawrence River by Jacques Cartier in 1534 and ending with the cession of New France to Spain and Great Britain in 1763  Map of North America  1750   Great Britain  pink   France  blue   and Spain  orange   At its peak in 1712  before the Treaty of Utrecht   the territory of New France extended from Newfoundland to the Rocky Mountains and from Hudson Bay to the Gulf of Mexico  The territory was then divided in five colonies  each with its own administration  Canada  Acadia  Hudson Bay  Newfoundland  Plaisance   18  and Louisiana  The Treaty of Utrecht resulted in the relinquishing of French claims to mainland Acadia  the Hudson Bay and Newfoundland colonies  and the establishment of the colony of  le Royale  Cape Breton Island  as the successor to Acadia  19  20   edit  Marquette and Jolliet Ca  1681 map of Marquette and Jolliet s 1673 expedition Many governors of settlements and kings of nations were hoping to be the first to find the Northwest Passage  a shortcut through the New World to the Indies of southeast Asia  The discovery of a Northwest Passage would result in great wealth for the founding nation because it would be able to directly import goods from the Asian markets while controlling the passage itself  In 1673  the governor of New France  Quebec  the French settlement started by Samuel de Champlain   sent Jacques Marquette  a Catholic priest and missionary  and Louis Jolliet  a French Canadian fur trader  along with seven other explorers  on a mission to find the Northwest Passage  The team began their trip in Quebec and traveled through Michigan s upper peninsula to the northern tip of Lake Michigan  On canoes  they crossed the massive lake and landed at present day Green Bay  Wisconsin at the mouth of the Fox River  They met native American Indians who described various rivers they would encounter  After portaging their canoes to the Wisconsin River  they entered the Mississippi River on June 17  1673  21  Marquette and Jolliet soon realized that the Mississippi couldn t possibly be the Northwest Passage they were hoping for because it flowed south  Nevertheless  the journey continued  They recorded much of the wildlife they encountered  They described the catfish as a monster with the head of a tiger  the nose of a wildcat  and with whiskers  They encountered herds of buffalo which they described as cattle  The pair rowed south past the junction of the Mississippi River and the Ohio River at present day St  Louis  Missouri  and turned around at the junction of the Mississippi River and Arkansas River  They believed that the Mississippi River flowed into the Gulf of Mexico and were wary of being captured by Spaniards who controlled the area  The Marquette and Jolliet party returned to Illinois Territory in late 1674  becoming the first Europeans to winter in what would become the city of Chicago  As welcomed guests of the Illinois Confederation  the explorers were feasted en route and fed ceremonial foods such as sagamite  22  Upon journey s end  Father Marquette and Louis Jolliet became the first Europeans to see and map the northern portion of the Mississippi River  Marquette and Jolliet did not discover the Mississippi  American Indians had been using it for thousands of years  and Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto had crossed it more than a century before them  They did confirm  however  that it was possible to travel easily from the Great Lakes all the way to the Gulf of Mexico by water  that the native peoples who lived along the route were generally friendly  and that the natural resources of the lands in between were extraordinary  Equipped with this information  French officials led by LaSalle would erect a 4 000 mile network of trading posts to systematically exploit those riches over the next century and a half  23  During the next century  the French established a network of fur trading posts and Jesuit missions along the Mississippi River system and the upper Great Lakes   edit  British American colonization Early Beaver Hunting Grounds French control over the area east of the Mississippi River ended in 1763 with the conclusion of the French and Indian War  British colonists began to expand into the Ohio Country during the 1750s  The Royal Proclamation of 1763 temporarily restrained expansion west of the Appalachian Mountains  but did not stop it completely  West of the Mississippi River  French settlers flourished in towns such as St  Louis and Ste  Genevieve until the mid 18th century  France ceded the rest of New France to Great Britain and Spain at the Treaty of Paris  which ended the Seven Years War  the French and Indian War   Britain received all lands east of the Mississippi River  including Canada  Acadia  and parts of Louisiana  while Spain received the territory to the west   the larger portion of Louisiana  Spain returned its portion of Louisiana to France in 1800  but French leader Napoleon Bonaparte sold it to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803  permanently ending French colonial efforts on the North American mainland  British American settlement began either via routes over the Appalachian Mountains  such as Braddock Road  or through the waterways of the Great Lakes  Fort Pitt  now Pittsburgh  at the source of the Ohio River was an early outpost of the overland routes  The first settlements in the Midwest via the waterways of the Great Lakes were centered around military forts and trading posts such as Green Bay  Sault Ste  Marie  and Detroit  The first inland settlements via the overland routes were in southern Ohio or northern Kentucky  on either side of the Ohio River  and early such pioneers included Daniel Boone and Spencer Records  The region s fertile soil made it possible for farmers to produce abundant harvests of cereal crops such as corn  oats  and  most importantly  wheat  The region soon became known as the nation s  breadbasket    edit  Development of transportation  edit  Waterways Lake Michigan is shared by four Midwestern states  Michigan  Indiana  Illinois  and Wisconsin  Two waterways have been important to the development of the Midwest  The first and foremost was the Ohio River  which flowed into the Mississippi River  Development of the region was halted until 1795 due to Spain s control of the southern part of the Mississippi and its refusal to allow the shipment of American crops down the river and into the Atlantic Ocean  The second waterway is the network of routes within the Great Lakes  The opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 completed an all water shipping route  more direct than the Mississippi  to New York and the seaport of New York City  In 1848  The Illinois and Michigan Canal breached the continental divide spanning the Chicago Portage and linking the waters of the Great Lakes with those of the Mississippi Valley and the Gulf of Mexico  Lakeport and river cities grew up to handle these new shipping routes  During the Industrial Revolution  the lakes became a conduit for iron ore from the Mesabi Range of Minnesota to steel mills in the Mid Atlantic States  The Saint Lawrence Seaway  1862  widened 1959  opened the Midwest to the Atlantic Ocean  The Upper Mississippi River near Harpers Ferry  Iowa  In the 1870s and 1880s  the Mississippi River inspired two classic books   Life on the Mississippi and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn   written by native Missourian Samuel Clemens  who used the pseudonym Mark Twain  His stories became staples of Midwestern lore  Twain s hometown of Hannibal  Missouri is a tourist attraction offering a glimpse into the Midwest of his time  Inland canals in Ohio and Indiana constituted another important waterway  which connected with Great Lakes and Ohio River traffic  The commodities that the Midwest funneled into the Erie Canal down the Ohio River contributed to the wealth of New York City  which overtook Boston and Philadelphia   edit  Railroads and the automobile During the mid 19th century the region got its first railroads  and the railroad junction in Chicago grew to be the world s largest  Even today  a century after Henry Ford  six Class I railroads meet in Chicago  In the period from 1890 to 1930 many Midwestern cities  towns  villages  and even farms were connected by interurbans  or electrical streetcars  The Midwest had more interurbans than any other region  citation needed  In 1916  Ohio led all states with 2 798 miles  4 503 km   Indiana followed with 1 825 miles  2 937 km   These two states alone had almost a third of the country s interurban trackage  24  The nation s largest interurban junction was in Indianapolis  During the first decade of the 20th century the city s 38  growth in population was attributed largely to the interurban  25  Competition with a growing population of automobiles and buses traveling on paved highways led to a decline in the interurban and other railroad passenger business  Henry Ford and Charles Kettering  the inventor of the electrical starting motor and leaded gasoline  were both products of the Midwest  as were the Wright Brothers   edit  Civil War  edit  Slavery prohibition and the underground railroad Map of various Underground Railroad routes The Northwest Ordinance region  comprising the heart of the Midwest  was the first large region of the United States that prohibited slavery  the Northeastern United States emancipated slaves in the 1830s   The regional southern boundary was the Ohio River  the border of freedom and slavery in American history and literature  see Uncle Tom s Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe and Beloved by Toni Morrison   The Midwest  particularly Ohio  provided the primary routes for the  Underground Railroad   whereby Midwesterners assisted slaves to freedom from their crossing of the Ohio River through their departure on Lake Erie to Canada  Created in the early 19th century  the Underground Railroad was at its height between 1850 and 1860  One estimate suggests that by 1850  100 000 slaves had escaped via the  Railroad   26  The Underground Railroad consisted of meeting points  secret routes  transportation  and safe houses and assistance provided by abolitionist sympathizers  Individuals were often organized in small  independent groups  this helped to maintain secrecy because individuals knew some connecting  stations  along the route but knew few details of their immediate area  Escaped slaves would move north along the route from one way station to the next  Although the fugitives sometimes traveled on boat or train  they usually traveled on foot or by wagon  27  The region was shaped by the relative absence of slavery  except for Missouri   pioneer settlement  education in one room free public schools  democratic notions brought by American Revolutionary War veterans  Protestant faiths and experimentation  and agricultural wealth transported on the Ohio River riverboats  flatboats  canal boats  and railroads  citation needed   edit  Bleeding Kansas The first violent conflicts leading up to the Civil War occurred between two neighboring Midwestern states  Kansas and Missouri  involving anti slavery Free Staters and pro slavery  Border Ruffian  elements  that took place in the Kansas Territory and the western frontier towns of Missouri roughly between 1854 and 1858  At the heart of the conflict was the question of whether Kansas would enter the Union as a free state or slave state  As such  Bleeding Kansas was a proxy war between Northerners and Southerners over the issue of slavery  The term  Bleeding Kansas  was coined by Horace Greeley of the New York Tribune  the events it encompasses directly presaged the Civil War  1855 Free State poster Setting in motion the events later known as  Bleeding Kansas   was the Kansas Nebraska Act  The Act created the territories of Kansas and Nebraska  opened new lands that would help settlement in them  repealed the Missouri Compromise  and allowed settlers in those territories to determine through popular sovereignty whether to allow slavery within their boundaries  It was hoped the Act would ease relations between the North and the South  because the South could expand slavery to new territories but the North still had the right to abolish slavery in its states  Instead  opponents denounced the law as a concession to the slave power of the South  The new Republican Party  born in the Midwest  Ripon  Wisconsin  1854  and created in opposition to the Act  aimed to stop the expansion of slavery and soon emerged as the dominant force throughout the North  28  An ostensibly democratic idea  popular sovereignty stated that the inhabitants of each territory or state should decide whether it would be a free or slave state  however  this resulted in immigration en masse to Kansas by activists from both sides  At one point  Kansas had two separate governments  each with its own constitution  although only one was federally recognized  On January 29  1861  Kansas was admitted to the Union as a free state  less than three months before the Battle of Fort Sumter officially began the Civil War  29  The calm in Kansas was shattered in May 1856 by two events that are often regarded as the opening shots of the Civil War  On May 21  the Free Soil town of Lawrence  Kansas was sacked by an armed pro slavery force from Missouri  A few days later  the Sacking of Lawrence led abolitionist John Brown and six of his followers to execute five men along the Pottawatomie Creek in Franklin County  Kansas  in retaliation  30  The so called  Border War  lasted for another four months  from May through October  between armed bands of pro slavery and Free Soil men  The U S  Army had two garrisons in Kansas  the First Cavalry Regiment at Fort Leavenworth and the Second Dragoons and Sixth Infantry at Fort Riley  31  The skirmishes endured until a new governor  John W  Geary  managed to prevail upon the Missourians to return home in late 1856  A fragile peace followed  but violent outbreaks continued intermittently for several more years  National reaction to the events in Kansas demonstrated how deeply divided the country had become  The Border Ruffians were widely applauded in the South  even though their actions had cost the lives of numerous people  In the North  the murders committed by Brown and his followers were ignored by most and lauded by a few  32  The civil conflict in Kansas was a product of the political fight over slavery  Federal troops were not used to decide a political question  but they were used by successive territorial governors to pacify the territory so that the political question of slavery in Kansas could finally be decided by peaceful  legal  and political means  An animation depicting when United States territories and states forbade or allowed slavery  1789 1861  The election of Abraham Lincoln in November 1860 was the final trigger for secession by the Southern states  33  Efforts at compromise  including the  Corwin Amendment  and the  Crittenden Compromise   failed  Southern leaders feared that Lincoln would stop the expansion of slavery and put it on a course toward extinction  The U S  federal government was supported by 20 mostly Northern free states in which slavery already had been abolished  and by five slave states that became known as the border states  All of the Midwestern states but one  Missouri  banned slavery  Though most battles were fought in the South  skirmishes between Kansas and Missouri continued until culmination with the Lawrence Massacre on August 21  1863  Also known as Quantrill s Raid  the massacre was a rebel guerrilla attack by Quantrill s Raiders  led by William Clarke Quantrill  on pro Union Lawrence  Kansas  Lawrence was targeted due to the town s long support of abolition and its reputation as a center for Redlegs and Jayhawkers  which were free state militia and vigilante groups known for attacking and destroying farms and plantations in Missouri s pro slavery western counties  The Lawrence Massacre was one of the bloodiest events in the history of Kansas and the nation  Quantrill s band of 448 Missouri guerrillas raided and plundered Lawrence  killing more than 150 and burning all the business buildings and most of the dwellings  Pursued by federal troops  the band escaped to Missouri  34  General Robert E  Lee surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia on April 9  1865  at the McLean House in the village of Appomattox Court House  35  On April 14  1865  President Lincoln was shot by John Wilkes Booth  a Southern sympathizer  Lincoln died early the next morning  and Andrew Johnson became president   edit  Industrialization and immigration By the time of the American Civil War  European immigrants bypassed the East Coast of the United States to settle directly in the interior  German immigrants to Ohio  Wisconsin  Minnesota  Illinois  and Missouri  Irish immigrants to port cities on the Great Lakes  especially Chicago  Danes  Swedes  and Norwegians to Iowa  Wisconsin  Minnesota  and the Dakotas  and Finns to Upper Michigan and northern central Minnesota  Poles  Hungarians  and Jews settled in Midwestern cities  The U S  was predominantly rural at the time of the Civil War  The Midwest was no exception  dotted with small farms all across the region  The late 19th century saw industrialization  immigration  and urbanization that fed the Industrial Revolution  and the heart of industrial domination and innovation was in the Great Lakes states of the Midwest  which only began its slow decline by the late 20th century  In the 20th century  African American migration from the Southern United States into the Midwestern states changed Chicago  St  Louis  Cleveland  Milwaukee  Kansas City  Cincinnati  Detroit  Minneapolis  and many other cities in the Midwest dramatically  as factories and schools enticed families by the thousands to new opportunities  Chicago alone gained hundreds of thousands of black citizens from the Great Migration and the Second Great Migration   edit  History of the term Midwest Theodore Roosevelt National Park is located in the Badlands of North Dakota  The term West was applied to the region in the early years of the country  In 1789  the Northwest Ordinance was enacted  creating the Northwest Territory  which was bounded by the Great Lakes and the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers  Because the Northwest Territory lay between the East Coast and the then far West  the states carved out of it were called the  Northwest   In the early 19th century  anything west of the Mississippi River was considered the West  The first recorded use of the term  Midwestern  to refer to a region of the central U S  occurred in 1886   Midwest  appeared in 1894  and  Midwesterner  in 1916  3  With the settlement of the western prairie  the new term Great Plains States was used for the row of states from North Dakota to Kansas  Later  these states also came to be considered Midwest by some  The states of the  old Northwest  are now called the  East North Central States  by the United States Census Bureau and the  Great Lakes  region by some of its inhabitants  whereas the states just west of the Mississippi and the Great Plains states are called the  West North Central States  by the Census Bureau  Today people as far west as eastern Colorado  Wyoming  and Montana  sometimes identify themselves with the term Midwest  36  Some parts of the Midwest are still referred to as  Northwest  for historical reasons   for example  Northwestern University in Illinois   so the Northwest region of the country is called the  Pacific Northwest  to make a clear distinction   edit  Farming and agriculture A pastoral farm scene near Traverse City  Michigan  with a classic American red barn  Rural farm road in Champaign County  Illinois amidst corn fields  Farming covers a large area of the American Midwest  The very dense soil of the Midwest plagued the first settlers who were using wooden plows  which were more suitable for loose forest soil  On the prairie  the plows bounced around and the soil stuck to them  This problem was solved in 1837 by an Illinois blacksmith named John Deere who developed a steel moldboard plow that was stronger and cut the roots  making the fertile soils of the prairie ready for farming  The tallgrass prairie has been converted into one of the most intensive crop producing areas in North America  Less than one tenth of one percent   lt 0 09   of the original landcover of the tallgrass prairie biome remains  37  States formerly with landcover in native tallgrass prairie such as Iowa  Illinois  Minnesota  Wisconsin  Nebraska  and Missouri have become valued for their highly productive soils and are included in the Corn Belt  As an example of this land use intensity  Illinois and Iowa rank 49th and 50th out of 50 states in total uncultivated land remaining  The region s fertile soil combined with the steel plow has made it possible for farmers to produce abundant harvests of cereal crops  such as corn  wheat  and oats  The region was soon known as the nation s  breadbasket   38   edit  Religion Religiously  like most of the United States  the Midwest is predominantly Christian  39  Roman Catholicism is the largest religious denomination in the Midwest  varying between 19 and 29  of the state populations  40 Southern Baptists compose 15 42  of Missouri s population  41  and a small percentage in other Midwestern states  Lutherans are prevalent in the Upper Midwest  especially in Minnesota and the Dakotas with their large Scandinavian and German populations  Judaism is practised by 2 5  and Islam is practised by 1  or less of the population  with higher concentrations in major urban areas  People with no religious affiliation make up 13 16  of the Midwest s population  Surveys show 54  of Midwesterners regularly attend church  42   edit  Music The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland with Lake Erie in the foreground  Because of 20th century African American migration from the South  a large African American urban population lives in most of the region s major cities  although the concentration is not generally as large as that of the Southern United States  The combination of industry and cultures  blues  and rock and roll led to an outpouring of musical creativity in the midwest during the post Civil Rights movement years  including major contributions to jazz  funk  and R amp B  and even new sub genres such as the Motown Sound and techno from Detroit or house music from Chicago  Additionally  the electrified Chicago blues sound exemplifies the genre  as popularized by record labels Chess and Alligator and portrayed in such films as The Blues Brothers  Godfathers and Sons  and Adventures in Babysitting  Rock and roll music was first identified as a new genre in 1951 by Cleveland  Ohio  disc jockey Alan Freed who began playing this music style while popularizing the term  rock and roll  to describe it  43  By the mid 1950s  rock and roll emerged as a defined musical style in the United States  deriving most directly from the rhythm and blues music of the 1940s  which itself developed from earlier blues  boogie woogie  jazz  and swing music  and was also influenced by gospel  country and western  and traditional folk music  Freed s contribution in identifying rock as a new genre helped establish the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to be located in Cleveland   edit  Cultural overlap This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources

cities of the Great Lakes   with their histories of 19th  and early 20th century immigration  manufacturing base  and strong Catholic influence   are more representative of the Midwestern experience  Certain areas of the traditionally defined Midwest are often cited as not being representative of the region  while other areas traditionally outside of the Midwest are often claimed to be part of the Midwest  These claims often embody historical  cultural  economic or demographic arguments for inclusion or exclusion  Perceptions of the proper classification of the Midwest also vary within the

challenged and removed   December 2010  The Midwest has always been a critical region in national elections  with highly contested elections in closely divided states  Especially in the late 19th and early 20th century both parties typically selected either their president or vice president from the region  The Little White Schoolhouse of Ripon  Wisconsin is listed on the List of Registered Historic Places  One of the two major political parties in the United States  the Republican Party  originated in Ripon  in east central Wisconsin  in the 1850s  although the fellow midwestern city of Jackson  Michigan also claims to be the birthplace of the Republican Party   It included opposition to the spread of slavery into new states as one of its agendas  The party stressed the Protestant ideals of thrift  hard work ethic  self reliance  democratic decision making and religious tolerance influenced both parties  In the early 1890s the wheat growing regions were strongholds of the Populist movement in the Plains states  It died out after 1896  Starting in the 1890s the middle class urban Progressive movement became influential in the region  as it was in other regions   with Wisconsin a major center  It fought against corruption and for efficiency  modernization and the use of experts to solve social  economic and political problems  Theodore Roosevelt s 1912 Progressive Party had the best showing in this region  carrying the states of Michigan  Minnesota  and South Dakota  Robert M  La Follette  Sr  s 1924 Progressive Party also showed a similar trend as he carried his home state of Wisconsin  The Midwest especially the areas west of Chicago has always been a stronghold of isolationism  a belief that America should not involve itself in foreign entanglements  This position gained much support from German  and Swedish American communities  with leaders such as Robert M  La Follette  Sr   Robert A  Taft  and Colonel Robert McCormick  publisher of the Chicago Tribune  51  52  Midwestern political caution is sometimes peppered with protest  especially in minority communities or those associated with agrarian  labor  or populist roots  This was especially true in the early 20th century  when Milwaukee was a hub of the Socialist movement in the United States  electing three Socialist mayors and the only Socialist Congressional representative  Victor L  Berger  during that time  The metropolis strewn Great Lakes region tends to be the most liberal area of the Midwest  and liberal presence diminishes gradually as one moves south and west from that region into the less populated rural areas  citation needed  The Great Lakes region has spawned politicians such as the La Follette political family  labor leader and five time Socialist Party of America presidential candidate Eugene V  Debs  and Communist Party leader Gus Hall  Minnesota has produced liberal national politicians Paul Wellstone  Walter Mondale  Eugene McCarthy  and Hubert Humphrey  and protest musician Bob Dylan   edit  Recent trends The region is now home to many critical swing states that do not have strong allegiance to either the Democratic or Republican party  Upper Midwestern states  such as Illinois  Minnesota  Wisconsin  and Michigan tend to vote Democratic  but the 2010 elections proved they can sometimes swing to either party  Indiana is usually considered a Republican stronghold  except in 2008  when the state voted for the Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama for the first time in 44 years  Prior to the 2008 presidential election  Missouri had supported the winning candidate all but once since the beginning of the 20th century  citation needed  As a result of the 2010 midterm elections  Republicans now control the governors  office in every Midwestern state  except Illinois  Minnesota  and Missouri  Republicans control every partisan state legislature in the Midwest  except Illinois and the Iowa Senate   The unicameral Nebraska Legislature is officially nonpartisan   The state government of Illinois is currently dominated by the Democratic Party  The state currently has one Republican senator  one Democratic senator  and an 11 8 Republican majority House delegation  Illinois voters have preferred the Democratic presidential candidate by a significantly large margin in the past five elections  1992  1996  2000  2004  2008   Iowa is considered by many analysts to be the most evenly divided state in the country  but it has leaned Democratic for the past fifteen years or more  Iowa had a Democratic governor from 1999 until Terry Branstad was re elected in the mid term elections in 2010  has had both a Democratic and Republican Senator since the early 1980s  currently has three Democratic Congressmen out of five  and has voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in four out of the last five elections   1992  1996  2000  2008   As a result of the 2010 elections  Republicans hold a significant majority in the Iowa House of Representatives  while Democrats hold a majority in the Iowa Senate  Minnesota voters have chosen the Democratic candidate for president longer than any other state  Minnesota was the only U S  state  along with Washington  D C   to vote for Walter Mondale over Ronald Reagan in 1984  Minnesota is Mondale s home state   In Iowa and Minnesota  however  the recent Democratic pluralities have often been fairly narrow  Minnesota has elected and re elected a Republican governor  as well as supported some of the strongest gun concealment laws in the nation  As a result of the 2010 elections  Republicans now control both houses of the Minnesota state legislature  Consistently  Ohio is a battle ground state in presidential elections   no Republican has won the office without winning Ohio  This trend has contributed to Ohio s reputation as a quintessential swing state  At the state level  however  Republicans are currently dominant  With the exception of one justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio  all statewide elected officials are Republicans  and Republicans have a majority in the Ohio House of Representatives and a supermajority in the Ohio Senate  Ohio has one Democratic and one Republican U S  Senator  As a result of the 2010 elections  13 of Ohio s 18 members of the U S  House of Representatives are Republicans  The Great Plains states of North Dakota  South Dakota  Nebraska  and Kansas have been strongholds for the Republicans for many decades  These four states have gone for the Republican candidate in every presidential election since 1940  except for Lyndon B  Johnson s landslide over Barry Goldwater in 1964  Although North Dakota and South Dakota have often elected Democrats to Congress  after the 2010 election both states  congressional delegations are majority Republicans  Nebraska has elected Democrats to the Senate and as Governor in recent years  but the state s House delegation has been all Republican since 1995  Kansas has elected a majority of Democrats as governor since 1956 but has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1932  Both of Kansas s U S  Seantors and all four of its U S  House members are Republican  Missouri is considered a  bellwether state   Only twice since 1904 has the Show Me State not voted for the winner in the presidential election  in 1956 and in 2008  when the state broke for Republican John McCain  Missouri s House delegation has generally been evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans  with the Democrats holding sway in the large cities at the opposite ends of the state  Kansas City and St  Louis  and the Republicans controlling the rest of the state  However  as a result of the 2010 elections  Republicans now have a 6 3 majority in the state s House delegation  Missouri s Senate seats were mostly controlled by Democrats until the latter part of the 20th century  but the Republicans have held one or both Senate seats continuously since the 1976 elections   edit  Iowa caucuses Main article  Iowa Caucuses The Iowa caucuses are an electoral event in which residents of Iowa meet in precinct caucuses in all of the state s 1 784 precincts and elect delegates to the corresponding county conventions  There are 99 counties in Iowa and thus 99 conventions  These county conventions then select delegates for both Iowa s Congressional District Convention and the State Convention  which eventually choose the delegates for the presidential nominating conventions  the national conventions   The 2012 Iowa Caucuses are scheduled to take place on February 6  2012  53  The caucuses are noteworthy for the amount of media attention they receive during U S  presidential election years  Since 1972  the Iowa caucuses have been the first major electoral event of the nominating process for President of the United States  Although only about one percent of the nation s delegates are chosen by the Iowa State Convention  the Iowa caucuses have served as an early indication of which candidates for president might win the nomination of their political party at that party s national convention  The Iowa caucuses are commonly recognized as the first step in the U S  presidential nomination process for both the Democratic and the Republican Parties   edit  See also Cuisine of the Midwestern United States Islands of the Midwest Western
