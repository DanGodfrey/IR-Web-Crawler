began during the early 1960s and lasted through the late 1990s  1  Whereas first wave feminism focused mainly on overturning legal obstacles to gender equality  i e  voting rights  property rights   second wave feminism broadened the debate to a wide range of issues  sexuality  family  the workplace  reproductive rights  de facto inequalities  and official legal inequalities  2  Second Wave Feminism radically changed the face of western culture  leading to marital rape laws  establishment of rape crisis and battered women s shelters  significant changes in custody and divorce law  and widespread integration of women into sports activities and the workplace  It also tried and failed to add the Equal Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution  Many feminists view the second

after World War II  8  The late 1940s post war boom  an era characterized by an unprecedented economic growth  a baby boom  and a move to the suburbs encouraged companionate marriages  This life was clearly illustrated by the media of the time  for example television shows such as Father Knows Best and Leave It to Beaver idealized domesticity  9  French writer Simone de Beauvoir had in the 1940s examined the notion of women being perceived as  other  in the patriarchal society  She went on to conclude that male centered ideology was being accepted as a norm and enforced by the ongoing development of myths  and that the fact that women are capable of getting pregnant  lactating  and menstruating is in no way a valid cause or explanation to place them as the  second sex   10  Beauvoir s book influenced Betty Friedan  who in her 1963 bestselling book The Feminine Mystique explicitly objected to the mainstream media image of women  stating that placing women at home limited their possibilities  and wasted talent and potential  The perfect nuclear family image depicted and strongly marketed at the time  she wrote  did not reflect happiness and was rather degrading for women  11  This book is widely credited with having begun second wave feminism  12  Though it is widely accepted that the movement lasted from the 1960s into the late 1990s  the exact years of the movement are more difficult to pinpoint and are often disputed  The movement is usually believed to have begun in 1963  when  Mother of the Movement  Betty Friedan published The Feminine Mystique  and President John F  Kennedy s Presidential Commission on the Status of Women released its report on gender inequality  The report  which revealed great discrimination against women in American life  along with Friedan s book  which spoke to the discontent of many women  especially housewives   led to the formation of many local  state  and federal government women s groups as well as many independent women s liberation organizations  Friedan was referencing a  movement  as early as 1964  13  The movement grew with legal victories such as the Equal Pay Act of 1963  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964  and the Griswold v  Connecticut Supreme Court ruling of 1965  in 1966 Friedan joined other women and men to found the National Organization for Women  Amongst the most significant legal victories of the movement after the formation of NOW were a 1967 Executive Order extending full Affirmative Action rights to women  Title IX and the Women s Educational Equity Act  1972 and 1974  respectively  educational equality   Title X  1970  health and family planning   the Equal Credit Opportunity Act  1974   the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978  the illegalization of marital rape  although not illegalized in all states until 1993 14    the legalization of no fault divorce  although not allowed in all states until 2010 15    a 1975 law requiring the U S  Military Academies to admit women  and many Supreme Court cases  perhaps most notably Reed v  Reed of 1971 and Roe v  Wade of 1973  However  the changing of social attitudes towards women is usually considered the greatest success of the women s movement  By the early 1980s  it was largely perceived that women had met their goals and succeeded in changing social attitudes towards gender roles  repealing oppressive laws that were based on sex  integrating the  boys  clubs  such as Military academies  the United States armed forces  NASA  single sex colleges  men s clubs  and the Supreme Court  and illegalizing gender discrimination  However  in 1982 adding the Equal Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution failed  three states short of ratification  Second wave feminism was largely successful  with the failure of the ratification of the ERA the only major legislative defeat  Efforts to ratify it have continued  and twenty one states now have ERAs in their state constitutions  Furthermore  many women s groups are still active and are major political forces  As of 2011 update   more women earn bachelor s degrees than men  16  half of the Ivy League presidents are women  the numbers of women in government and traditionally male dominated fields have dramatically increased  and in 2009 the percentage of women in the American workforce temporarily surpassed that of men  17  The salary of the average American woman has also increased over time  although as of 2008 it is only 77  of the average man s salary  a phenomenon often referred to as the Gender Pay Gap  18  Whether this is due to discrimination is very hotly disputed  however economists and sociologists have provided evidence to that effect  19  20  21   edit  View on popular culture Second wave feminists viewed popular culture as sexist  and created pop culture of their own to counteract this  Artist Helen Reddy s song  I Am Woman  played a large role in popular culture and became a feminist anthem  Reddy came to be known as a  feminist poster girl  or a  feminist icon   22  23  24  25  26  27  28   One project of second wave feminism was to create  positive  images of women  to act as a counterweight

gender  Mississippi University for Women  the first public or government institution for women in the United States  changed its admissions policies and became coeducational after the ruling  99  In what was her first opinion written for the Supreme Court  Justice Sandra Day O Connor stated   In limited circumstances  a gender based classification favoring one sex can be justified if it intentionally and directly assists members of the sex that is disproportionately burdened   She went on to point out that there are a disproportionate number of women who are nurses  and that denying admission to men  lends credibility to the old view that women  not men  should become nurses  and makes the assumption that nursing is a field for women a self fulfilling prophecy   100  In the dissenting opinions  Justices Harry A  Blackmun  Warren E  Burger  Lewis F  Powell  Jr   and William H  Rehnquist suggested that the result of this ruling would be the elimination of publicly supported single sex educational opportunities  This suggestion has proven to be accurate as there are no public women s colleges in the United States today and  as a result of United States v  Virginia  the last all male public university in the United States  Virginia Military Institute  was required to admit women  The ruling did not require the university to change its name to reflect
