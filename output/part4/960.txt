carried out  Fleming was also involved in the planning and overseeing of two active service units  30 Assault Unit and T Force  His experiences of the people he met during his wartime service provided much of the background and detail of the Bond novels and his career as a journalist added colour and depth to the stories  In 2008  The Times ranked Fleming fourteenth on its list of  The 50 greatest

brothers  Michael  1913 1940  and Richard Fleming  1911 1977  and an illegitimate younger maternal half sister  cellist Amaryllis Fleming  1925 1999  whose father was artist Augustus John  6   edit  Education and early career In 1914 Fleming was sent to Durnford School  a preparatory school on the Isle of Purbeck in Dorset  7  The school was near to the estate of the Bond family  who could trace their ancestry back to an Elizabethan spy called John Bond and whose motto was Non Sufficit Orbis The World Is Not Enough  8  Fleming did not enjoy his time at Durnford  his life included unpalatable food  physical hardship and bullying  7  It was during his stay at Durnford that Fleming received the news of his father s death  9  Dear Mum  My coff has grown to a whoping coff now  Don t tell Mr Pellatt  the headmaster  cause just this morning he said that nun of us had coffs  I am afraid that I do not like school very much  Ian Fleming  aged 7  writing to his mother from Durnford school  10  Eton College  Fleming s alma mater from 1921 to 1927  From 1921 Fleming followed his brother Peter to Eton College  Although not one of the academic stars of the school  he excelled at athletics and was Victor Ludorum for two years running  in 1925 and 1926  only the second person to accomplish this  11  Fleming also became involved in editing a magazine  The Wyvern  1  Fleming s lifestyle at Eton brought him into conflict with his housemaster  E  V  Slater  who disapproved of Fleming s attitude  his hair oil  his ownership of a car and the fact he had a mistress  7  Slater persuaded Fleming s mother to remove Fleming from Eton a term early for a crammer course to gain entry to the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst  7  Fleming spent less than a year at Sandhurst  leaving in 1927  without gaining a commission after he picked up a case of gonorrhea  11  His mother sent him to a small private school  the Tennerhof  in the town of Kitzb hel  Austria  run by the Adlerian disciple Ernan Forbes Dennis  a former British spy  and his American wife  the novelist Phyllis Bottome  12  His language skills developed well and from the Tennerhof he studied briefly at Munich University and the University of Geneva  1  Whilst in Geneva Fleming became engaged to a French Swiss woman Monique Panchaud de Bottomes in 1931  13  Fleming s mother disapproved and made him break off the relationship  14  He applied for entry to the Foreign Office  but failed the examinations and his mother intervened in his affairs to lobby Sir Roderick Jones  head of Reuters News Agency  and in October 1931 he was eventually given a position as a sub editor and journalist for the Reuters news service  1  In 1933 Fleming spent time in Moscow covering the Stalinist show trial of six engineers from the British company Metropolitan Vickers  15  Whilst there he applied for an interview with Soviet premier Joseph Stalin and was amazed to receive a personally signed note apologising for not being able to attend  16  Fleming bowed to family pressure in October 1933 and moved into the banking world with a position at Cull  amp  Co  15  He was not a good banker and  in October 1935  became a stockbroker with Rowe and Pitman  headquartered on Bishopsgate  London  16  a position in which he also struggled to become a success  17   edit  World War II On 24 May 1939 Fleming had lunch with Rear Admiral John Godfrey  Director of Naval Intelligence of the Royal Navy  at the Grill of the Carlton Hotel on Haymarket where he was recruited to become Godfrey s personal assistant  Fleming joined the organisation full time in August 1939  18  with the codename  17F   19  working out of Room 39 at The Admiralty  20  His biographer  Andrew Lycett  notes that Fleming had  no obvious qualifications  for the appointment  1  As part of his appointment  Fleming was commissioned into the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in July 1939  18  initially as lieutenant  20  but promoted to Commander by September 1939  21  Fleming proved to be an excellent PA for Godfrey  with a talent for administration  1  As Godfrey was a prickly character who made a number of enemies within government circles  he used Fleming as a liaison with other sections of the government wartime administration  such as the Secret Intelligence Service  the Political Warfare Executive  the Special Operations Executive  the Joint Intelligence Committee and the Prime Minister s staff  22  On 29 September 1939 only 29 days after the start of World War II Godfrey published a memorandum largely written by Fleming  The trout memo  23  The memo contained a number of schemes to be considered for use against the Axis powers  in order to lure U boats and German surface ships towards minefields  24  Number 28 on the list was an idea to use a corpse  carrying misleading papers  which the enemy could find  this suggestion formed the basis of Operation Mincemeat  the successful 1943 deception plan to cover the intended invasion of Italy from North Africa  25  A Suggestion  not a very nice one  The following suggestion is used in a book by Basil Thomson  a corpse dressed as an airman  with despatches in his pockets  could be dropped on the coast  supposedly from a parachute that has failed  I understand there is no difficulty in obtaining corpses at the Naval Hospital  but  of course  it would have to be a fresh one John Godfrey and Ian Fleming  The trout memo  29 September 1939  25  In 1940  Fleming and Godfrey contacted Kenneth Mason  Professor of Geography at Oxford University  about the preparation of reports on the geography of countries involved in military operations  These reports were the precursors of the Naval Intelligence Division Geographical Handbook Series produced between 1941 and 1946  26  On 12 September 1940 Fleming wrote a memo to Godfrey that instigated a plan named Operation Ruthless  aimed at obtaining details of the Enigma codes used by the German Navy  The memo read  1  Obtain from the Air Ministry an air worthy German Bomber 2  Pick a tough crew of five  including a pilot  W T  wireless telegraph  operator and word perfect German speaker  Dress them in German Air Force uniform  add blood and bandages to suit  3  Crash plane in the Channel after making SOS to rescue service in P L  plain language  4  Once aboard rescue boat  shoot German crew  dump overboard  bring rescue boat back to England Ian Fleming  memo to John Godfrey  12 September 1940  27  Much to the annoyance of Alan Turing and Peter Twinn at Bletchley Park  the mission was never carried out  Fleming s niece  Lucy Fleming  stated that the reason given was that an official at the Royal Air Force pointed out that if they were to drop a downed Heinkel bomber in the English Channel  it would probably sink rather quickly  28  Fleming also worked with Colonel  Wild Bill  Donovan  President Franklin D  Roosevelt s special representative on intelligence co operation between London and Washington  29  In May 1941 Fleming accompanied Godfrey to the United States and assisted in writing a blueprint for the Office of the Coordinator of Information  the department which turned into the Office of Strategic Services and eventually became the CIA  30   edit  Operation Golden Eye In 1941 42 Admiral Godfrey put Fleming in charge of Operation Golden Eye  a plan to maintain an intelligence framework in Spain in the event of a German takeover of the territory  31  The plan  drawn up by Fleming  involved maintaining communication with Gibraltar and launching sabotage operations against the Nazis  32  Again Fleming liaised with Donovan over American involvement in ensuring the Germans did not dominate the seaways  33   edit  30 Assault Unit 30 commando Assault Unit badge In 1942 Fleming had formed a specialist unit of commandos  known as No  30 Commando  or 30 Assault Unit  30AU   a group of specialist intelligence commandos  34  30 AU s job was to be near the front line of an advance sometimes in front of it  to seize enemy documents from HQs previously targeted  35  The unit was based on a similar German group headed by Otto Skorzeny  who had undertaken similar activities in the Battle of Crete in May 1941  36  Fleming thought the German unit was  one of the most outstanding innovations in German intelligence   37  Fleming did not fight in the field with the unit  but selected targets and directed operations from the rear  36  On formation the unit was only thirty strong  but grew to five times that size  37  The unit was filled with men from other commando units and trained in unarmed combat  safe cracking lock picking at the Special Operations Executive  SOE  facilities  36  In late 1942 Captain  later Rear admiral  Edmund Rushbrooke replaced Godfrey as head of the Naval Intelligence Division and Fleming s influence in the organisation declined  although he still retained control over 30AU  1  Fleming called the unit his  Red Indians   38  although this annoyed some of the unit s members who had little time for Fleming  37  Prior to the Normandy landings  most of the operations were in the Mediterranean  However  because of their successes in Sicily and Italy  30AU  based at the Marine Hotel  Littlehampton  West Sussex  became greatly trusted by naval intelligence  39  40  In March 1944  Fleming oversaw the distribution of intelligence through to Royal Navy units in preparation for Operation Overlord 41  and he subsequently followed the unit into Germany after they located the German naval archives from 1870  located in Tambach Castle  42  Fleming visited 30AU in the field during and after Operation Overlord  especially following an attack on Cherbourg  He was concerned that the unit had been incorrectly used as a regular commando force  rather than as an intelligence gathering unit  This wasted the men s specialist skills  risked their safety on operations that did not justify the use of such skilled operatives and threatened the vital gathering of intelligence  Following this  the management of these units was revised  39  Fleming was replaced as head of 30AU on 6 June 1944  36   edit  T Force In August 1944  following the success of 30AU  it was decided to establish a  Target Force   which became known as T Force  The official memorandum  held at The National Archives in London described their primary role  T Force   Target Force  to guard and secure documents  persons  equipment  with combat and Intelligence personnel  after capture of large towns  ports etc  in liberated and enemy territory  National Archives document WO219 551  Special Force to Seize Intelligence  43  Fleming sat on the committee that selected the targets for this unit  helping to create what were known as the  Black Books  which were issued to the officers of this unit  44  The infantry component of T Force was in part made up of the 5th Battalion  King s Regiment  which supported the Second Army  45  It was responsible for securing targets of interest to the British military  These included nuclear laboratories  gas research centres and individual rocket scientists  The unit s most notable coup was during the advance on the German port of Kiel  where it captured the research centre for German engines used for the V 2 rocket  Messerschmitt Me 163 fighters and high speed U boats  46  Fleming was to use elements of the activities of T Force  particularly in his 1955 Bond novel Moonraker  47   edit  1945 1953 Fleming was a bibliophile who  from 1929 onwards and with the assistance of bookseller Percy Muir  collected a library of over one thousand copies of what Fleming described as  books that made things happen   48  These books represented  milestones in modern science  technology and Western civilization   49  He concentrated on science and technology  had a copy of Charles Darwin s On the Origin of Species but also owned other significant works ranging from Adolf Hitler s Mein Kampf to Scouting for Boys  50  He was a major lender to the 1963 exhibition Printing and the Mind of Man  Fleming served on the board of The Book Collector journal  and owned the small publishing firm Queen Anne Press  51  In 1970 the collection was acquired by the Lilly Library at Indiana University for  150 000   897 686 in 2012 dollars 52   53  Goldeneye  where Fleming wrote all the Bond stories  In 1942 Fleming attended an Anglo American intelligence summit in Jamaica  despite the constant heavy rain during his visit Fleming decided to live on the island once the war was over  54  His friend Ivar Bryce helped find a plot of land in Saint Mary Parish and  in 1945  Fleming had a house built there  which he named Goldeneye  55  The name of the house and estate where he wrote his novels has many possible sources  Ian Fleming himself cited both his wartime Operation Golden Eye  56  but also the 1941 novel  Reflections in a Golden Eye by Carson McCullers  55  When Fleming was demobbed in May 1945  he joined the Kemsley newspaper group  who at the time owned The Sunday Times  Fleming became Foreign Manager  overseeing the work of the worldwide network of the paper s correspondents  His contract with Kemsley contained a clause that allowed him to take three months  holiday every winter in Jamaica  1  Fleming married Anne Charteris on 24 March 1952 in Jamaica  The ceremony was witnessed by his friend and neighbour  the playwright No l Coward  57  She and Fleming had been having an affair since some point in the 1930s  although at the time she was married to the third Baron O Neill  58  He was killed in action on the Italian front in 1944 and she expected that she and Fleming would marry afterwards  but Fleming decided to remain a bachelor  1  Instead  on 28 June 1945  she married the second Viscount Rothermere  59  Despite her marriage to Rothermere  she continued to see Fleming and visited him in Jamaica having told her husband that she was visiting No l Coward  In 1948 she gave birth to a daughter by Fleming  Mary  although the child lived for only a few hours  In 1951 Rothermere divorced her because of her relationship with Fleming  59  Both Fleming and Ann had affairs during their marriage  she  most notably  with Hugh Gaitskell  the Leader of the Labour Party and Leader of the Opposition  60  Fleming had a long term affair in Jamaica with one of his neighbours  Blanche Blackwell  mother of Chris Blackwell of Island Records  61   edit  Writing career Casino Royale was published in 1953  all 4 728 copies were sold in the first month  Although during the war Fleming had mentioned to friends that he wanted to write a spy novel  1  it was not until 1952 that he began to write his first novel  Casino Royale  He started writing his book at his Jamaican home Goldeneye  on 17 February 1952  typing out 2 000 words in the morning  directly from his own experiences and imagination  62  he finished work on the script in just over two months  63  completing it on 18 March 1952  64  He afterwards claimed that he started to write to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials to his pregnant girlfriend  Ann Charteris  65  Fleming described the work as his  dreadful oafish opus  66  and showed it to an ex girlfriend  Clare Blanchard  who advised him not to publish it at all  but that if he did so  it should be under another name  67  On 12 May 1952 Fleming had lunch at The Ivy with his friend William Plomer and after prompting from Plomer admitted he had written a book  Plomer asked to see a copy and Fleming obliged  but was diffident about it  saying  so far as I can see the element of suspense is completely absent   68  Plomer thought the book had sufficient promise to forward a copy to a reader at Jonathan Cape  Although Cape were initially unenthusiastic about the novel  Fleming s brother Peter whose book Cape had published persuaded the company to publish Fleming s book  68  On 13 April 1953 Casino Royale was released in the UK in hardcover  priced at 10s  6d  69  with a cover that had been devised by Fleming himself  70  4 728 copies of Casino Royale were printed  selling out in less than a month  70  a second print run the same month also sold out  69  as did a third run of more than 8 000 books published in May 1954  71  The novel centred on the exploits of James Bond  an intelligence officer in the Secret Intelligence Service  commonly known as MI6  Bond was also known by his code number  007  and was a Royal Naval Reserve Commander  Fleming took the name for his character from that of the American ornithologist James Bond  a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies  Fleming  a keen birdwatcher himself  had a copy of Bond s guide and he later explained to the ornithologist s wife that  It struck me that this brief  unromantic  Anglo Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed  and so a second James Bond was born   72  He further explained that  When I wrote the first one in 1953  I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull  uninteresting man to whom things happened  I wanted him to be a blunt instrument   when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God   James Bond  is the dullest name I ever heard  Ian Fleming  The New Yorker  21 April 1962 73  Fleming based his creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II  admitting that Bond  was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war   74  Amongst those types were his brother  Peter  who Fleming worshipped  74  and who had been involved in behind the lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war  5  Aside from Fleming s brother  a number of others also provided some aspects of Bond s make up  including Conrad O Brien ffrench  a spy whom Fleming had met whilst skiing in Kitzb hel in the 1930s  Patrick Dalzel Job  who served with distinction in 30 AU during the war  and Bill  Biffy  Dunderdale  station head of MI6 in Paris  who wore cufflinks and handmade suits and was chauffeured around Paris in a Rolls Royce  74  75 Sir Fitzroy MacLean was another figure mentioned as a possibility  based on his wartime work behind enemy lines in the Balkans  as was the MI6 double agent Du an Popov  76  One of the biggest influence on the Bond character was Fleming himself  who endowed Bond with many of his own traits  including sharing the same golf handicap  the taste for scrambled eggs and using the same brand of toiletries  37  Bond s tastes are also often taken from Fleming s own as was his behaviour  with Bond s love of golf and gambling mirroring Fleming s own  77  James Bond is the culmination of an important but much maligned tradition in English literature  As a boy  Fleming devoured the Bulldog Drummond tales of Lieutenant Colonel Herman Cyril McNeile  aka  Sapper   and the Richard Hannay stories of John Buchan  His genius was to repackage these antiquated adventures to fit the fashion of postwar Britain     In Bond  he created a Bulldog Drummond for the jet age  William Cook in New Statesman 77  After the publication of Casino Royale  Fleming used his annual holiday at his house in Jamaica to write another Bond story  1  in total  between 1953 and 1966  two years after his death  twelve Bond novels and two short story collections were published  with the last two books The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylights published posthumously  78  Much of the background to the stories came from Fleming s previous work in the Naval Intelligence Division or to events he knew of from the Cold War  79 From Russia  with Love uses the lure of a fictional Soviet Spektor decoding machine  which had its roots in the German World War II Enigma machine  80  The novel also used the plot device of spies on the Orient Express  Fleming knew of the story of Eugene Karp  a US naval attach  and intelligence agent based in Budapest who  in February 1950  took the Orient Express from Budapest to Paris  carrying a number of papers about blown US spy networks in the Eastern Bloc  Soviet assassins were already on the train  The conductor was drugged and Karp s body was found shortly afterwards in a railway tunnel south of Salzburg  81  Many of the names used in the Bond works are from people Fleming knew  Scaramanga was a fellow schoolboy at Eton  with whom Fleming fought  79 Goldfinger was named after British architect Ern  Goldfinger  whose work Fleming abhorred  79  Sir Hugo Drax was named after an acquaintance of Fleming s  Admiral Sir Reginald Aylmer Ranfurly Plunkett Ernle Erle Drax 82   his assistant  Krebbs  bears the same name as Hitler s last Chief of Staff  83  whilst one of the homosexual villains from Diamonds Are Forever   Boofy  Kidd  was named after one of Fleming s close friends and a relative of his wife Arthur Gore  8th Earl of Arran  79  In 1957 Fleming published his first work of non fiction  The Diamond Smugglers  based on background research for his fourth Bond novel  Diamonds Are Forever  84  Much of the material had been published in The Sunday Times and was based on Fleming s interviews with Sir Percy Sillitoe  the ex Director General of MI5  who had headed up the International Diamond Security Organisation after leaving MI5  85  The book received mixed reviews in the UK and US markets  86    I have just finished what is  without doubt  the nastiest book I have ever read     Paul Johnson   New Statesman  5 April 1958 For the first five books Casino Royale  Live and Let Die  Moonraker  Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia  with Love Fleming received broadly positive reviews from the critics  87  that began to change in March 1958 when Bernard Bergonzi  in Twentieth Century  attacked Fleming s work  saying that it contained  a strongly marked streak of voyeurism and sado masochism  88  and that the books showed  the total lack of any ethical frame of reference   88  The article also compared Fleming unfavourably to John Buchan and Raymond Chandler in both moral and literary measures  89  A month later Dr  No was published and Fleming received harsh criticism from a number of reviewers who  in the words of author and historian Ben Macintyre   rounded on Fleming  almost as a pack   90  The most infamous of the critiques and the most strongly worded came from Paul Johnson of the New Statesman who opened his review   Sex  Snobbery and Sadism   91  with   I have just finished what is  without doubt  the nastiest book I have ever read   91  Johnson went on to say that  by the time I was a third of the way through  I had to suppress a strong impulse to throw the thing away   91  Although Johnson recognised that in Bond there  was a social phenomenon of some importance   91  this was as a negative element  as the phenomenon concerned  three basic ingredients in Dr No  all unhealthy  all thoroughly English  the sadism of a schoolboy bully  the mechanical  two dimensional sex longings of a frustrated adolescent  and the crude  snob cravings of a suburban adult   91  Johnson saw no positives in Dr  No  saying that  Mr Fleming has no literary skill  the construction of the book is chaotic  and entire incidents and situations are inserted  and then forgotten  in a haphazard manner   91  Biographer Andrew Lycett noted that following the attacks on his work  allied with marital problems  Fleming  went into a personal and creative decline   1 Goldfinger had already been written before Dr  No s publication  so the next book Fleming produced after the criticism was a collection of short stories  For Your Eyes Only  which were adaptations of outlines written for a television series which did not come to fruition  92  Lycett noted that at the time Fleming was writing both the television scripts  and the short story collection   Ian s mood of weariness and self doubt was beginning to affect his writing  and this can be seen in Bond s internal monologue of thoughts  93  Fleming followed up the book by novelizing a film script that he had worked on with others  the resulting novel being Thunderball  The work had started in 1958 when Fleming s friend  Ivar Bryce  introduced him to a young Irish writer and director  Kevin McClory  and the three of them  together with Fleming and Bryce s friend Ernest Cuneo worked on a script  86  In October McClory introduced experienced screenwriter Jack Whittingham to the writing process 94  and by December 1959 McClory and Whittingham sent Fleming a script  95  Fleming had been having second thoughts on McClory s involvement and  in January 1960  Fleming explained his intention of delivering the screenplay to MCA  with a recommendation from him and Bryce that McClory act as producer  96  Additionally  Fleming told McClory that if MCA rejected the film because of McClory s involvement  then McClory should either sell himself to MCA  back out of the deal  or file suit in court  96  Fleming then wrote the novel Thunderball at Goldeneye over the period January to March 1960  based on the screenplay written by himself  Whittingham and McClory  97  In March 1961 McClory read an advance copy of the book and he and Whittingham immediately petitioned the High Court in London for an injunction to stop publication  98  After two court actions the second in November 1961 99  Fleming offered a deal to McClory  settling out of court  McClory gained the literary and film rights for the screenplay  while Fleming was given the rights to the novel  although it had to be recognised as being  based on a screen treatment by Kevin McClory  Jack Whittingham and the Author   100  Fleming s books had always sold well  but in 1961 sales increased dramatically  On 17 March 1961 four years after it had been published and three years after the heavy criticism of Dr  No From Russia  with Love was listed as one of US President John F  Kennedy s ten favourite books  in an article in Life Magazine  101  Kennedy and Fleming had previously met in Washington  73  this accolade  and its associated publicity  led to a surge in sales that made Fleming the biggest selling crime writer in the US  102  103  Personally I think from Russia  with Love was  in many respects  my best book  but the great thing is that each one of the books seems to have been a favourite with one or other section of the public and none has yet been completely damned  Ian Fleming 80  In April 1961  between the two court cases surrounding Thunderball  and because of his concerns over the forthcoming  second case  1  Fleming suffered a heart attack during a regular weekly meeting at The Sunday Times  104  During his convalescence he began working on a children s novel  Chitty Chitty Bang Bang  104  which was published in October 1964  two months after Fleming s death  105  In June 1961  Fleming sold a six month option on the film rights to his already published as well as future James Bond novels and short stories to Harry Saltzman  98  Saltzman was subsequently introduced to Albert R   Cubby  Broccoli and the pair co produced Dr  No  which was released in 1962 through their joint production vehicle  Eon Productions  106  After an extensive search Broccoli and Saltzman hired Sean Connery on a five film deal  107 Sean Connery s depiction of Bond in Dr  No affected the literary character  in You Only Live Twice  the first book written after Dr  No was released  Fleming gave Bond a sense of humour and Scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories  108  In November 1963  a second non fiction book was published  Thrilling Cities  109  The book is a re print of a series of articles first published in The Sunday Times based on Fleming s impressions of a number of world cities  110  in trips Fleming had taken in 1959 and 1960  111  In 1964 Fleming was approached by producer Norman Felton to write a spy series for television  Fleming agreed and provided Felton with a number of ideas  including the names of characters  Napoleon Solo and April Dancer for the series The Man from U N C L E   112  After Eon Productions heard of the project they asked Fleming to withdraw to avoid any legal problems that may occur if the project overlapped with Bond  Fleming agreed and withdrew from The Man from U N C L E   113  In January 1964 Fleming went to Goldeneye for his last holiday  writing the first draft of The Man with the Golden Gun  114  He was dissatisfied with the result and wrote to the copy editor of all his novels  William Plomer  saying it needed a lot of re writing  115  As time went on Fleming became increasingly unhappy with the book and thought about re working it in the spring of 1965  but was persuaded against it by Plomer  who considered the novel viable for publication  116  Five months after returning from Jamaica  on the morning of 12 August 1964  Fleming died of a heart attack  117  Fleming s last two books The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylights were published posthumously  78 The Man with the Golden Gun was published eight months after Fleming s death and had not been through the full editing process by Fleming  118  As a result the novel was thought by publishers Jonathan Cape to be thin and  feeble   119  Cape had passed the manuscript to Kingsley Amis to read on holiday  paying him  35 15 shillings for his thoughts and advice  although Amis  subsequent suggestions were not used by the publishing house  119  Fleming biographer Henry Chandler noted that the novel  received polite and rather sad reviews  recognizing that the book had effectively been left half finished  and as such did not represent Fleming at the top of his game   120  The final Bond book Octopussy and The Living Daylights was published in Britain on 23 June 1966  121  it was a collection of two short stories  121   edit  Death and legacy Ian Fleming s grave and memorial at Sevenhampton  Fleming was a heavy smoker and heavy drinker and suffered from

128  and Raymond Benson  129  In observance of what would have been Fleming s 100th birthday in 2008  Ian Fleming Publications commissioned Sebastian Faulks to write a new Bond novel entitled Devil
