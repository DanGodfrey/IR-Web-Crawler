the Canadian Broadcasting Centre  in Toronto Main article  Timeline of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation In 1929  the Aird Commission on public broadcasting recommended the creation of a national radio broadcast network  A major concern was the growing influence of American radio broadcasting as U S  based networks began to expand into Canada  Meanwhile  Canadian National Railways was making a radio network to keep its passengers entertained and give it an advantage over its rival  CP  This  the CNR Radio  is the forerunner of the CBC  Graham Spry and Alan Plaunt lobbied intensely for the project on behalf of the Canadian Radio League  In 1932 the government of R B  Bennett established the CBC s predecessor  the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission  CRBC   The CRBC took over a network of radio stations formerly set up by a federal Crown corporation  the Canadian National Railway  The network was used to broadcast programming to riders aboard its passenger trains  with coverage primarily in central and eastern Canada  On November 2  1936  the CRBC was reorganized under its present name  While the CRBC was a state owned company  the CBC was a Crown corporation on the model of the BBC  Leonard Brockington was the CBC s first chairman  For the next few decades  the CBC was responsible for all broadcasting innovation in Canada  This was in part because  until 1958  it was not only a broadcaster  but the chief regulator of Canadian broadcasting  It used this dual role to snap up most of the clear channel licences in Canada  It began a separate French language radio network in 1937  It introduced FM radio to Canada in 1946  though a distinct FM service wasn t launched until 1960  Television broadcasts from the CBC began on September 6  1952  with the opening of a station in Montreal  Quebec  CBFT   and a station in Toronto  Ontario  CBLT  opening two days later  The CBC s first privately owned affiliate television station  CKSO in Sudbury  Ontario  launched in October 1953   At the time  all private stations were expected to affiliate with the CBC  a condition that relaxed in 1960 61 with the launch of CTV   From 1944 to 1962  the CBC split its English language radio network into two services known as the Trans Canada Network and the Dominion Network  The latter  carrying lighter programs including American radio shows  was dissolved in 1962  while the former became known as CBC Radio   In the late 1990s  CBC Radio was rebranded as CBC Radio One and CBC Stereo as CBC Radio Two  The latter was re branded slightly in 2007 as CBC Radio 2   On July 1  1958  CBC s television signal was extended from coast to coast  The first Canadian television show shot in colour was the CBC s own The Forest Rangers in 1963  However  colour television broadcasts did not begin until July 1  1966  and full colour service began in 1974  In 1978  CBC became the first broadcaster in the world to use an orbiting satellite for television service  linking Canada  from east to west to north    edit  Frontier Coverage Package Starting in 1967 and continuing until the mid 1970s  the CBC provided limited television service to remote and northern communities  Transmitters were built in a few locations and carried a four hour selection of black and white videotaped programs each day  The tapes were flown into communities to be shown  then transported to other communities  often by the  bicycle  method used in television syndication  Transportation delays ranged from one week for larger centres to almost a month for small communities  The first FCP station was started in Yellowknife in 1967  the second in Whitehorse in 1968  Additional stations were added from 1969 to 1972  Most stations were fitted for the Anik satellite signal during 1973  carrying 12 hours of colour programming  Broadcasts were geared to either the Atlantic time zone  UTC 4 or  3  or the Pacific time zone  UTC 8 or  7  even though the audience resided in communities in time zones varying from UTC 5 to UTC 8  Some of these stations used non CBC callsigns such as CFWH TV in Whitehorse  while some others used the standard CB T callsign  It would be many years before television programs originated in the north without the help of the south  starting with one half hour per week in the 1980s with Focus North and graduating to a daily half hour newscast

the CBC  designed by  cole des Beaux Arts student Hortense Binette 2  and used between 1940 and 1958  featured a map of Canada and a thunderbolt design used to symbolize broadcasting  In 1958  the CBC adopted a new logo for use at the end of network programs  Designed by scale model artist Jean Paul Boileau  it consisted of the legends  CBC  and  Radio Canada  overlaid on a map of Canada  For French programming  the  Radio Canada  was placed on top  The  Butterfly  logo was designed for the CBC by Hubert Tison in 1966 to mark the network s progressing transition from black and white to colour television  much in the manner of the NBC peacock logo  It was used at the beginning of programs broadcast in colour  and was used until all CBC television programs had successfully switched to colour  A sketch on the CBC Television program Wayne  amp  Shuster once referred to this as the logo of the  Cosmic Butterfly Corporation   3  The logo officially known internally as  the gem   was designed for the CBC by graphic artist Burton Kramer in 1974  and it is the most widely recognized symbol of the corporation  The main on air identification featured the logo kaleidoscopically morphing into its form while radiating outward from the centre of the screen on a blue background  Some refer to this animated version as  The Exploding Pizza   The appearance of this logo marked the arrival of full colour network television service  The large shape in the middle is the letter C  which stands for Canada  and the radiating parts of the C symbolize broadcasting  The original theme music for the 1974 CBC ident was a three note woodwind orchestral fanfare accompanied by the voiceover  This is CBC  or  Ici Radio Canada   4  This was later replaced by the more familiar 11 note synthesized jingle  which was used until December 31  1985  5  6  The updated one colour version of the gem logo was introduced on January 1  1986  and with it was introduced a new series of computer graphic generated television idents for CBC and Radio Canada  These idents consisted of different background colours corresponding to the time of day behind a translucent CBC gem logo  accompanied by different arrangements of the CBC s new  orchestrated five note jingle  The logo was officially changed to one colour  generally dark blue on white  or white on dark blue in 1986  Print ads and most television promos  however  have always used a single colour version of this logo since 1974  In 1992  CBC updated its logo design to make it simpler and more red  or white on a red background   The new logo design reduces the number of geometric sections in the logo to 13 instead of the previous logo s 25  and the  C  in the center of the logo became a simple red circle  Also  new television idents were introduced in November that year  also using CGI  Since the early 2000s  it has also appeared in white  sometimes red  on a textured or coloured background  It is now CBC Radio Canada s longest used logo  surpassing the original incarnation of the Gem logo and the CBC s 1940 logo   edit  Nicknames As the oldest currently operating Canadian broadcaster  and still the largest in terms of national availability of its various networks  the nickname  Mother Corp  and variants thereof are sometimes used in reference to the CBC  7  A popular satirical nickname for the CBC  commonly used in the pages of Frank  is  the Corpse   There is an urban legend that a CBC announcer once referred to the network on the air as the  Canadian Broadcorping Castration   which also sometimes remains in use as a satirical nickname  Quotations of the supposed spoonerism are wildly variable in detail on what was said  when it was said or even who the announcer was  but there is no evidence to confirm the truth of the story  The only known recording of this phrase being spoken was created by American radio producer Kermit Schaefer for one of his best selling Pardon My Blooper record albums in the 1950s  and is not in fact a real recording of a CBC broadcast  Some have referred to the CBC as the  Corporate Broadcasting Corporation  for an alleged free market bias  though the CBC is largely publicly funded  8  The CBC has also been mistakenly referred to as the Canadian Broadcasting Company  9   edit  Corporation Main article  List of assets owned by Canadian Broadcasting Corporation  edit  Mandate The 1991 Broadcasting Act states that       the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation  as the national public broadcaster  should provide radio and television services incorporating a wide range of programming that informs  enlightens and entertains     the programming provided by the Corporation should  be predominantly and distinctively Canadian  reflect Canada and its regions to national and regional audiences  while serving the special needs of those regions  actively contribute to the flow and exchange of cultural expression  be in English and in French  reflecting the different needs and circumstances of each official language community  including the particular needs and circumstances of English and French linguistic minorities  strive to be of equivalent quality in English and French  contribute to shared national consciousness and identity  be made available throughout Canada by the most appropriate and efficient means and as resources become available for the purpose  and reflect the multicultural and multiracial nature of Canada   edit  Management As a crown corporation  the CBC operates at arm s length  autonomously  from the government in its day to day business  The corporation is governed by the Broadcasting Act of 1991  under a Board of Directors and is directly responsible to Parliament through the Department of Canadian Heritage  General management of the organization is in the hands of a president  who is appointed by the Governor General of Canada in Council  on the advice of the prime minister   edit  Board of Directors In accordance with the Broadcasting Act  the Board of Directors is responsible for the management of the Corporation  The Board is made up of 12 members  including the Chair and the President and CEO  As

53 billion from all revenue sources  including government funding via taxpayers  subscription fees  advertising revenue  and other revenue  e g  real estate   Expenditures for the year included  616 million for English television   402 million for French television   126 million for specialty channels  a total of  348 million for radio services in both languages   88 million for management and technical costs  and  124 million for  amortization of property and equipment   Some of this spending was derived from amortization of funding from previous years  12  Among its revenue sources for the year ending March 31  2006  the CBC received  946 million in its annual funding from the federal government  as well as  60 million in  one time  supplementary funding for programming  However  this supplementary funding has been repeated annually for a number of years  This combined total is just over a billion dollars annually and is a source of heated debate  To supplement this funding  the CBC s television networks and websites sell advertising  while cable satellite only services such as CBC News Network additionally collect subscriber fees  in line with their privately owned counterparts  CBC s radio services do not sell advertising except when required by law  for example  to political parties during federal elections   CBC s funding differs from that of the public broadcasters of many European nations  which collect a licence fee  or those in the United States  such as PBS and NPR  which receive some public funding but rely to a large extent on voluntary contributions from individual viewers and listeners  An Abacus poll from August 2011 showed that approximately one out of two Canadians would like to see the CBC s funding switched to the PBS NPR model  while one out of three Canadians want Parliament to sell off or privatize the CBC  On the other hand  one out of four Canadians want the CBC s annual subsidy to be increased  13  The network s defenders note that the CBC s mandate differs from private media s  particularly in its focus on Canadian content  that much of the public funding actually goes to the radio networks  and that the CBC is responsible for the full cost of most of its prime time programming  while private networks can fill up most of their prime time schedules with American series acquired for a fraction of their production cost  CBC supporters also claim that additional  long term funding is required to provide better Canadian dramas and improved local programming   edit  Services  edit  News Main article

Cha ne and Espace musique  CBC Radio One and Premi re Cha ne focus on news and information programming  but they air some music programs  variety shows  comedy  and sports programming  Historically  CBC Radio One has broadcast primarily on the AM band  but many stations have moved over to FM  Over the years  a number of CBC radio transmitters with a majority of them on the AM band have either moved to FM or had shutdown completely  Further information  List of defunct CBC radio transmitters in Canada CBC Radio 2 and Espace musique  found exclusively on FM  air arts and cultural programming  with a focus on music  CBC Radio 3  found only online and on satellite radio  airs exclusively independent Canadian music  CBC Radio also operates two shortwave services  One  Radio Nord Qu bec  broadcasts domestically to Northern Quebec on a static frequency of 9625 kHz  and the other  Radio Canada International  provides broadcasts to the United States and around the world in eight languages  Additionally  the Radio One stations in St  John s and Vancouver operate shortwave relay transmitters  broadcasting at 6160 kHz  Some have suggested 14  that CBC Radio Canada create a new high power shortwave digital radio service for more effective coverage of isolated areas  In November 2004  the CBC  in partnership with Standard Broadcasting and Sirius Satellite Radio  applied to the CRTC for a license to introduce satellite radio service to Canada  The CRTC approved the subscription radio application  as well as two others for satellite radio service  on June 16  2005  Sirius Canada launched on December 1  2005  with a number of CBC Radio channels  including the new services CBC Radio 3 and Bande   part  In some areas  especially national or provincial parks  the CBC also operates an AM or FM transmitter rebroadcasting weather alerts from the Meteorological Service of Canada s Weatheradio Canada service   edit  Television Further information  CBC Television  T l vision de Radio Canada The CBC operates two national broadcast television networks  CBC Television in English  and la T l vision de Radio Canada in French  Like private broadcasters  both those networks sell advertising  but offer more Canadian produced programming  Most CBC television stations  including those in the major cities  are owned and operated by the CBC itself and carry a common schedule  aside from local programming  Some stations that broadcast from smaller cities are private affiliates of the CBC  that is  stations which are owned by commercial broadcasters and air a predominantly CBC schedule  However  most affiliates of the English network opt out of some network programs to air local programming or more popular foreign programs acquired from other broadcasters  Private affiliates of the French network  all of which are located in Quebec  rarely have the means to provide alternate programming  Such private affiliates are becoming increasingly rare  and there have been indications that the CBC plans to discontinue all affiliation agreements with non CBC owned television stations in the 2010s  CBC television stations in Nunavut  the Northwest Territories and Yukon tailor their programming mostly to the local native population  and broadcast in many native languages  such as Inuktitut  Gwich in  and Dene  One of the most popular shows is the weekly Saturday night broadcast of NHL hockey games  In English  the program is known as Hockey Night in Canada  and in French  it was called La Soir e du hockey  Both shows began in 1952  The French edition was discontinued in 2004  though Radio Canada stations outside of Quebec simulcast some Saturday night games produced by RDS until 2006  The network suffered considerable public embarrassment when it lost the rights to the show s theme music following a protracted lawsuit launched by the song s composer and publishers  15  Ratings for CBC Television have declined in recent years  In Quebec  where the majority speaks French  la T l vision de Radio Canada is popular and garners some of the highest ratings in the province  Both terrestrial networks have also begun to roll out high definition television feeds  with selected NHL and CFL games produced in HD for the English network  After the digital switchover  CBC chose to use the 720p format on CBC and Radio Canada  16  The CBC also operates three specialty television channels   CBC News Network  an English language news channel  RDI  a French language news channel  and Bold  a Category 1 digital service  It owns a managing interest in the Francophone arts service ARTV  and  82   of the digital channel  Documentary  edit  Online Further information  CBC ca  Radio Canada ca The CBC has two main websites  One is in English  at CBC ca  which was established in 1996  17  the other is in French  18  The website allows the CBC to produce sections which complement the various programs on television and radio  In 2012  the corporation launched CBC Music  a digital music service which produces and distributes 40 music related webstreams  including the existing audio streams of both CBC Radio 2 and CBC Radio 3  19  In 2012  the CBC announced its plans for a new local news service in Hamilton  Ontario  20  With the Hamilton area already within the broadcast range of CBC Radio and CBC Television s services in Toronto  it was not financially or technically feasible for the public broadcaster to launch new conventional radio or television stations in Hamilton  accordingly  the corporation has developed a new model  with Hamilton as its test project  to launch a local digital service that would be accessible on the Internet and telecommunications devices such as tablets and smartphones  20  The project is scheduled to launch in spring 2012  20   edit  Merchandising Established in 2002  the CBC Radio Canada merchandising business operates retail locations and cbcshop ca  21  its educational sales

label which distributes CBC programming  including live concert performances and album transcripts of news and information programming such as the Massey Lectures  in album format  Music albums on the label  predominantly in the classical and jazz genres  are distributed across Canada in commercial record stores  while albums containing spoken word programming are predominantly distributed by the

the summer of 1981 there was a major disruption of CBC programming as the technicians union  N A B E T   National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians  went on strike  Local newscasts were cut back to the bare minimum  This had the effect of delaying the debut of The Journal  which had to wait until January 1982  On August 15  2005  5 500 employees of the CBC  about 90   were locked out by CBC CEO Robert Rabinovitch in a dispute over future hiring practices  At issue were the rules governing the hiring of contract workers in preference to full time hires  The locked out employees were members of the Canadian Media Guild  representing all production  journalistic and on air personnel outside Quebec and Moncton  including several foreign correspondents  While CBC services continued during the lockout  they were primarily made up of repeats  with news programming from the BBC and newswires  Major CBC programs such as The National and Royal Canadian Air Farce were not produced during the lockout  some non CBC owned programs seen on the network  such as The Red Green Show  shifted to other studios  Meanwhile  the locked out employees produced podcasts and websites such as CBCunplugged com  which many credited with swaying public opinion to the union s side  citation needed  After a hiatus  talks re opened  In addition  the Canadian public was becoming irritated with the loss of quality of their publicly funded service  citation needed  On September 23  the federal minister of labour called Robert Rabinovitch and Arnold Amber  the president of the CBC branch of the Canadian Media Guild  to his office for talks aimed at ending the dispute  Late in the evening of October 2  2005  it was announced that the CBC management and staff had reached a tentative deal which resulted in the CBC returning to normal operations on October 11  Some speculated that the looming October 8 start date for the network s most important television property  Hockey Night in Canada  had acted as an additional incentive to resolve the dispute  The CBC has been affected by a number of other labour disputes since the late 1990s  In early 1999  CBC English  and French network technicians in all locations outside Quebec and Moncton  members of the Communications  Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada  went on strike  The Canadian Media Guild was set to strike as well  but the CBC settled with both unions  A similar dispute  again involving all technicians outside Quebec and Moncton  occurred in late 2001 and concluded by the end of the year  In spring 2002  on air staff in Quebec and Moncton  again  on both English and French networks  were locked out by local management  leaving  among other things  NHL playoff games without commentary on French television  While all labour disputes resulted in cut back programming and numerous repeat airings  the 2005 lockout may have been the most damaging to CBC  All local programming in the affected regions was cancelled and replaced by abbreviated national newscasts and national radio morning shows  BBC World  television  and World Service  radio  and Broadcast News feeds were used to provide the remainder of original news content  and the CBC website consisted mainly of rewritten wire copy  Some BBC staff protested against their material being used during the CBC lockout   The NUJ and BECTU will not tolerate their members  work being used against colleagues in Canada   said a joint statement by BBC unions  The CMG questioned whether  with its limited Canadian news content  the CBC was meeting its legal requirements under the Broadcasting Act and its CRTC licences  Galaxie  which CBC owned at the time  supplied some music content for the radio networks  Tapes of previously aired or produced documentaries  interviews and entertainment programs were also aired widely  Selected television sports coverage  including that of the Canadian Football League  continued  but without commentary  As before  French language staff outside of Quebec were also affected by the 2005 lockout  although with Quebec producing the bulk of the French networks  programming  those networks were not as visibly affected by the dispute apart from local programs   edit  Cultural significance Since the 1970s  the CBC has not maintained the dominance in broadcasting it formerly had  says who   but it still plays an important role  The CBC s cultural influence  like that of many public broadcasters  has waned in recent decades  This is partly due to severe budget cuts by the Canadian federal government  which began in the late 1980s and levelled off in the late 1990s  It is also due to industry wide fragmentation of television audiences  the decline of network television generally  due to the rise in specialty channel viewership  as well as the increase of non television entertainment options such as video games  the Internet  etc    Private networks in Canada face the same competition  but their viewership is declining more slowly than CBC Television s  In English speaking Canada  the decline in CBC viewership can be partly attributed to the fact that private television networks primarily rebroadcast popular American programming with substituted Canadian advertising  American programs appear to attract higher audiences than do much of the made in Canada programming that is a CBC specialty  Viewership on the CBC s French television network has also declined  mostly because of stiff competition from private French language networks  Audience fragmentation is another issue  French Canadians prefer home grown television programming  a vibrant Quebec star system is in place  and little American or foreign content airs on French language networks  public or private  On the other hand  the CBC s French language radio channel is sometimes the top rated network  In the case of breaking news  including federal elections  the CBC may still hold a slight edge  For instance  after election night 2006  CBC Television took out full page newspaper ads claiming that 2 2 million Canadians watched their coverage  more than any other broadcaster  However  in similar ads  CTV also claimed to be number one  stating there was a CBC audience of only 1 2 million  In both cases  the methodologies were not clear from the ads  such as whether simulcasts on one or both of the networks  news channels  Newsworld for CBC  Newsnet for CTV  were counted  The CBC was the only television network broadcasting in Canada until the creation of ITO  a short lived predecessor of today s CTV  in 1960  even then  large parts of Canada did not receive CTV service until the late 1960s or early 1970s  The CBC also had the only national radio network  Its cultural impact was therefore significant since many Canadians had little or no choice for their information and entertainment other than from these two powerful media  Even after the advent of commercial television and radio  the CBC has remained one of the main elements in Canadian popular culture through its obligation to produce Canadian television and radio programming  The CBC has made programs for mass audiences and for smaller audiences interested in drama  performance arts  documentaries  current affairs  entertainment and sport  The 1950s saw the CBC providing hands on training and employment for actors  writers  and directors in the developing field of its television dramatic services  and later saw much of the talent heading south to seek fame and fortune in New York and Hollywood  Competition from private broadcasters like CTV  Global  and other broadcast television stations and specialty channels has lessened the CBC s reach  but nevertheless it remains a major influence on Canadian popular culture  According to the corporation s research  92  of Canadians consider the CBC an essential service  24   edit  International Broadcasts  edit  Newsworld International From 1994 to 2000  the CBC  in a venture with Power Broadcasting  former owner of CKWS in Kingston   jointly owned two networks  Newsworld International  NWI   an American cable channel that rebroadcast much of the programming of CBC Newsworld  now known as CBC News Network   Trio  an arts and entertainment channel  In 2000  CBC and Power Broadcasting sold these channels to Barry Diller s USA Networks  Diller s company was later acquired by Vivendi Universal  which in turn was partially acquired by NBC to form NBC Universal  NBC Universal still owns the Trio brand  which no longer has any association with the CBC  and  as of the end of 2005  became an Internet only broadband channel   However  the CBC continued to program NWI  with much of its programming simulcast on the domestic Newsworld service  In late 2004  as a result of a further change in NWI s ownership to the INdTV consortium  including Joel Hyatt and former Vice President of the United States Al Gore   NWI ceased airing CBC programming on August 1  2005  when it was renamed Current TV   edit  U S  border audiences In U S  border communities such as Bellingham  Seattle  Buffalo  Detroit and Burlington  CBC radio and television stations can be received over the air and have a significant audience  citation needed  Some CBC programming is also rebroadcast on local radio  such as New Hampshire Public Radio  CBC television channels are available on cable systems located near the Canadian border  For example  CBET Windsor is available on cable systems in the Detroit  Michigan  and Toledo  Ohio  areas  CBUT is broadcast on Comcast in the Seattle  Washington  area  At night  the AM radio transmissions of both CBC and SRC services can be received over much of the northern portion of the United States  from stations such as CBW in Winnipeg and CBK in Saskatchewan   edit  Carriage of CBC News On September 11  2001  several American broadcasters without their own news operations  including C SPAN  carried the CBC s coverage of the September 11  2001  attacks in New York City and Washington  D C  In the days after September 11  C SPAN carried CBC s nightly newscast  The National  anchored by Peter Mansbridge  The quality of this coverage was recognized specifically by the Canadian Journalism Foundation  editor in chief Tony Burman later accepted the Excellence in Journalism Award  2004   for  rigorous professional practice  accuracy  originality and public accountability   on behalf of the service  C SPAN has also carried CBC s coverage of major events affecting Canadians  including  Canadian federal elections  key proceedings in Canadian Parliament  Six days in September 2000 that marked the death and state funeral of Pierre Elliott Trudeau  the power outage crisis in summer 2003  U S  presidential elections  e g  in 2004  C SPAN picked up The National the day after the election for the view from Canadians   state visits and official visits of American presidents to Canada  and Barack Obama inauguration in 2009  Several PBS stations also air some CBC programming However  these programs are syndicated by independent distributors and are not governed by the PBS  common carriage  policy  Other American broadcast networks sometimes air CBC reports  especially for Canadian events of international significance  For example  in the early hours after the Swissair Flight 111 disaster  CNN aired CBC s live coverage of the event  Also in the late 1990s  CNN Headline News aired a few CBC reports of events that were not significant outside Canada   edit  CBC Radio Some CBC Radio One programs  such as Definitely Not the Opera and As It Happens  also air on some stations associated with American Public Media or Public Radio International  With the launch of Sirius Canada in December 2005  some of the CBC s radio networks  including Radio Canada International and Sirius exclusive Radio Three and Bande   part channels  are available to Sirius subscribers in the United States   edit  Caribbean and Bermuda Several Caribbean nations carry feeds of CBC TV  Bahamas  on the CoralWave  Cable Bahamas  television system in the Northern Bahamas  Channel 8   Barbados  on the Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation Multi Choice TV Cable system  Channel 703   Bermuda  on the CableVision digital cable service  Grenada  carried on Columbus Communications owned cable system Flow Grenada  Jamaica  distributed in areas served by Flow Jamaica  Trinidad and Tobago  on the Columbus Communications Trinidad Ltd   CCTL  television system   edit  Availability of CBC Channels and Programming The CBC channel  Radio Canada  CBC Newsworld and all other CBC channels like CBC Bold and Galaxie can be received through cable and satellite TV channel providers across Canada  like through Bell Expressvu  Rogers Cable  Videotron  Cogeco  and other smaller TV providers  The CBC  amp  SRC channel signals can also be obtained free of charge  over the air  through antenna receivers in Canada or in border states along the Canada U S  border  however CBC is not obtainable as a  free to air   FTA  channel on FTA satellites  signals are encrypted on the Anik space satellites    edit  Controversies  edit  Allegations of liberal bias In 2009  CBC President Hubert Lacroix commissioned a study to determine whether its news was biased  and if so  to what extent  He said   Our job   and we take it seriously   is to ensure that the information that we put out is fair and unbiased in everything that we do   25  The study  the methodology of which was not specified  is due to report results in the fall of 2010  25 Krista Erickson  a reporter for CBC  was transferred following an investigation by CBC officials at the behest of a formal complaint made by the Conservative Party  The move was intended to end debate after a leak to the media over CBC feeding questions to a Parliamentary committee in an effort to embarrass the Conservative government  In April 2010  the Conservatives accused pollster Frank Graves of giving partisan advice to the Liberal Party of Canada  noting his donations to the party since 2003  Graves directed a number of public opinion research projects on behalf of the CBC as well as other media organizations  and also appeared on a number of CBC television programs relating to politics  An investigation conducted by the CBC ombudsman found no evidence to support these allegations  stating that personal donor history is not relevant to one s objectivity as a pollster  26   edit  Closed captioning CBC Television was an early leader in broadcasting programming with closed captioning for the hearing impaired  airing its first captioned programming in 1981  27  Captioned programming in Canada began with the airing of Clown White in English language and French language versions on CBC Television and Radio Canada  respectively  Most sources list that event as occurring in 1981  28  while others list the year as 1982  29  In 1997  Henry Vlug  a deaf lawyer in Vancouver  filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission alleging that an absence of captioning on some programming on CBC Television and Newsworld infringed on his rights as a person with a disability  A ruling in 2000 by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal  which later heard the case  sided with Vlug and found that an absence of captioning constituted discrimination on the basis of disability  30  The Tribunal ordered CBC Television and Newsworld to caption the entirety of their broadcast days   including television shows  commercials  promos and unscheduled news flashes  from sign on until sign off   The ruling recognized that  there will inevitably be glitches with respect to the delivery of captioning  but that  the rule should be full captioning   In a negotiated settlement to avoid appealing the ruling to the Federal Court of Canada  CBC agreed to commence 100  captioning on CBC Television and Newsworld beginning November 1  2002  31  CBC Television and Newsworld are apparently the only broadcasters in the world required to caption the entire broadcast day  However  published evidence asserts that CBC is not providing the 100  captioning ordered by the Tribunal  32  In 2004  retired Canadian Senator Jean Robert Gauthier  a hard of hearing person  filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission against Radio Canada concerning captioning  particularly the absence of real time captioning on newscasts and other live programming  As part of the settlement process  Radio Canada agreed to submit a report on the state of captioning  especially real time captioning  on Radio Canada and RDI  33  The report  which was the subject of some criticism  proposed an arrangement with Cit  Coll giale  a community college in Ottawa  to train more French language real time captioners  34  35  English language specialty networks owned or co owned by CBC  including Bold and Documentary  have the lower captioning requirements typical of larger Canadian broadcasters  90  of the broadcast day by the end of both networks  licence terms 36  37    ARTV  the French language specialty network co owned by CBC  has a maximum captioning requirement of 53   38   edit  Beyond the Red Wall In November 2007  the CBC replaced their documentary Beyond the Red Wall  Persecution of Falun Gong  about persecution of Falun Gong members in China  at the last minute with a rerun episode regarding President Pervez Musharaf in Pakistan  Originally  the broadcaster had said to the press that  the crisis in Pakistan was considered more urgent and much more newsworthy   but sources from within the network itself had stated that the Chinese government had called the Canadian Embassy and demanded repeatedly that the program be taken off the air  The documentary in question was to air on Tuesday  November 6  2007 on CBC Newsworld  but was replaced  39  The documentary aired two weeks later on November 20  2007  40  after editing  41   edit  Over the air digital television transition See also  Digital television in Canada Status of Digital Television Transition The CRTC has ordered that in 28  mandatory markets   full power over the air analog television transmitters must cease transmitting by August 31  2011  Broadcasters can either continue serving those markets by transitioning analog transmitters to digital or cease broadcasting over the air  Cable  IPTV  and satellite services are not involved or affected by this digital transition deadline  While its fellow Canadian broadcasters plan to convert most of their transmitters to digital by the Canadian digital television transition deadline of August 31  2011  CBC plans to serve only about half of the mandatory markets with each of its digital over the air television  15 of 28 markets with CBC TV  and 14 of 28 markets with SRC   Due to financial difficulties reported by the corporation  the corporation has published digital transition plans that will result in none of its analog re transmitters in mandatory markets being converted to digital by the deadline  Under this plan  communities that receive analog signals by re broadcast transmitters in mandatory markets will lose their over the air  OTA  signals as of the deadline  Rebroadcast transmitters account for 23 of the 48 CBC and SRC transmitters in mandatory markets  Mandatory markets losing both CBC and SRC over the air signals include London  Ontario  metropolitan area population 457 000  and Saskatoon  Saskatchewan  metro area 257 000   In both of those markets  the corporation s television transmitters are the only ones that are not planned to be converted to digital by the deadline  In addition  many of the cities where a digital transmitter is planned have CBC and Radio Canada over the air in analogue  but in only 7 markets across the country will both CBC and Radio Canada be available digital  The 13 other markets having digital transmitters installed will only have one CBC service over the air once the analogue signals are required to be shut off  For instance  Moncton  New Brunswick will have Radio Canada in digital  but not CBC  In markets where a digital transmitter is being installed  existing coverage areas are not necessarily being maintained  For instance  the CBC plans to implement a digital transmitter covering Fredericton  New Brunswick in the place of the existing transmitter covering Saint John  New Brunswick and Fredericton  and will continue analog service to Saint John  According to CBC s application for this transmitter to the CRTC  the population served by the digital transmitter would be 113 930 people versus 303 465 served by the existing analog transmitter  In Victoria  the replacement of the Vancouver analogue transmitters with digital ones will allow only some northeastern parts of the metropolitan area  total population 330 000  to receive either CBC or SRC  The CBC has also stated that the  useful life of CBC Radio Canada s satellite distribution backbone for analogue transmission ends in 2013  and that it  will not reinvest in that infrastructure given the inevitability of analogue obsolescence   42   edit  CBC and affiliate transmitters in mandatory markets See also  List of television stations in Canada CBC Television

 Yukon  edit  History In 2006  the CBC submitted a plan to the CRTC for transitioning over the air television signals from analog to digital  In this submission  the CBC stated that its 654 analog transmitters reached 98  of the population  and that it planned on installing 44 digital transmitters  reaching 80  of Canadians  43  The CRTC decided to impose a mandatory transition date switching over the air television signals from analog to digital  following consultation with CBC and the public  CBC had requested during this consultation that broadcasters be given 4 years to transition  Following the consultation  on May 17  2007  the CRTC imposed a transition timeline of 4 years  resulting in a transition deadline of August 31  2011 and requiring that over the air analog transmitters be shut off by that date  On July 6  2009  the CRTC limited the August 31  2011 transition deadline to certain mandatory markets  greatly reducing the number of transmitters needing to be transitioned  In CBC s 2009 2010 Corporate Plan  the corporation stated that it planned on having 30 transmitters broadcasting in digital by the deadline  costing  30 million  On August 6  2010  the CBC issued a press release stating that due to financial reasons  the CBC and Radio Canada would only transition 27 transmitters total  one in each market where there was an originating station  i e  a CBC or Radio Canada television station located in that market   Further  the CBC stated in the release  that only 15 of the transmitters would be in place by August 31  2011 due to lack of available funds  and that the remainder would not be on the air until as late as August 31  2012  44  Additionally  the CBC stated in the release that it was asking the CRTC for permission to continue broadcasting in analog until the identified transmitters for transition were up and running  At the time of the press release  only 8 of the corporation s transmitters  4 CBC and 4 Radio Canada  were broadcasting in digital  On November 30  2010  CBC s Senior Director  Regulatory Affairs  issued a letter to the CRTC regarding CBC s plans for transitioning to digital  The letter states   CBC Radio Canada will not be converting its analog re transmitters in mandatory markets to digital after August 31  2011    45  On December 16  2010  some months after the CRTC issued a bulletin reminding broadcasters that analog transmitters had to be shut off by the deadline in mandatory markets  the CBC revised the documents accompanying its August 6  2010 press release to state that it had the money for and is striving to transition all 27 transmitters by August 31  2011  On March 23  2011  the CRTC rejected an application by the CBC to install a digital transmitter serving Fredricton  New Brunswick in place of the analog transmitter serving Fredericton and Saint John  NB  which would have served only 62 5  of the population served by the existing analog transmitter  46  The CBC issued a press release stating  CBC Radio Canada intends to re file its application with the CRTC to provide more detailed cost estimates that will allow the Commission to better understand the unfeasibility of replicating the Corporation s current analogue coverage   47  The press release further adds that the CBC suggests coverage could be maintained if the CRTC were to  allow CBC Television to continue providing the analogue service it offers today   much in the same way the Commission permitted recently in the case of Yellowknife  Whitehorse and Iqaluit   On March 29  2011  the CRTC added the following condition of license to over the air stations owned by CBC   Unless otherwise authorized by the Commission  the licensee shall not transmit analog television signals after 31 August 2011 in mandatory markets designated as such by the Commission in Broadcasting Regulatory Policy 2011 184 or transmit television signals on channels 52 to 69    48  On August 18  2011  the CRTC issued a decision that allows CBC s mandatory market rebroadcasting transmitters in analog to remain on air until August 31  2012  49  Before that deadline  CBC s license renewal process will take place and CBC s digital transition plans will be examined as part of that process  The requirement remains for all of CBC s full power transmitters occupying channels 52 to 69 to either relocate to channels 2 to 51 or become low power transmitters  In some cases  CBC has opted to reduce the power of existing transmitters to low power transmitters  which will result in signal loss for some viewers   edit
