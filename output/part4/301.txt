American author and humorist  He is most noted for his novels  The Adventures of Tom Sawyer  1876   and its sequel  Adventures of Huckleberry Finn  1885   2  the latter often called  the Great American Novel   Twain grew up in Hannibal  Missouri  which would later provide the setting for Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer  He apprenticed with a printer  He also worked as a typesetter and contributed articles to his older brother Orion s newspaper  After toiling as a printer in various cities  he became a master riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River  before heading west to join Orion  He was a failure at gold mining  so he next turned to journalism  While a reporter  he wrote a humorous story   The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County   which became very popular and brought nationwide attention  His travelogues were also well received  Twain had found his calling  He achieved great success as a writer and public speaker  His wit and satire earned praise from critics and peers  and he was a friend to presidents  artists  industrialists  and European royalty  He lacked financial acumen  and  though he made a great deal of money from his writings and lectures  he squandered it on various ventures  in particular the Paige Compositor  and was forced to declare bankruptcy  With the help of Henry Huttleston Rogers he eventually overcame his financial troubles  Twain worked hard to ensure that all of his creditors were paid in full  even though his bankruptcy had relieved him of the legal responsibility  Twain was born during a visit by Halley s Comet  and he predicted that he would  go out with it  as well  He died the day following the comet s subsequent return  He was lauded as the  greatest American humorist of his age   3  and William

Langhorne Clemens was born in Florida  Missouri on November 30  1835  He was the son of Jane  n e Lampton  1803 1890   a native of Kentucky  and John Marshall Clemens  1798 1847   a Virginian by birth  His parents met when his father moved to Missouri and were married several years later  in 1823  5  6  He was the sixth of seven children but only three of his siblings survived childhood  his brother Orion  1825 1897   Henry  who died in a riverboat explosion  1838 1858   and Pamela  1827 1904   His sister Margaret  1833 1839  died when he was three  and his brother Benjamin  1832 1842  died three years later  Another brother  Pleasant  1828 1829   died at six months  7  Twain was born two weeks after the closest approach to Earth of Halley s Comet  When he was four  Twain s family moved to Hannibal  Missouri  8  a port town on the Mississippi River that inspired the fictional town of St  Petersburg in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn  9  Missouri was a slave state and young Twain became familiar with the institution of slavery  a theme he would later explore in his writing  Twain s father was an attorney and judge  10  The Hannibal and St  Joseph Railroad was organized in his office in 1846  The railroad connected the second and third largest cities in the state and was the westernmost United States railroad until the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad  It delivered mail to and from the Pony Express  11  Samuel Clemens  age 15 In 1847  when Twain was 11  his father died of pneumonia  12  The next year  he became a printer s apprentice  In 1851  he began working as a typesetter and contributor of articles and humorous sketches for the Hannibal Journal  a newspaper owned by his brother Orion  When he was 18  he left Hannibal and worked as a printer in New York City  Philadelphia  St  Louis  and Cincinnati  He joined the newly formed International Typographical Union  the printers union and educated himself in public libraries in the evenings  finding wider information than at a conventional school  13  Clemens came from St  Louis on the packet Keokuk in 1854  14  and lived in Muscatine during part of the summer of 1855  The Muscatine newspaper published eight stories which amounted to almost 6 000 words  15  On a voyage to New Orleans down the Mississippi  steamboat pilot Horace E  Bixby inspired Twain to become a pilot himself  As Twain observed in Life on the Mississippi  the pilot surpassed a steamboat s captain in prestige and authority  it was a rewarding occupation with wages set at  250 per month  16  A steamboat pilot needed to know the ever changing river to be able to stop at the hundreds of ports and wood lots  Twain studied 2 000 miles  3 200 km  of the Mississippi for more than two years before he received his steamboat pilot license in 1859  This occupation gave him his pen name  Mark Twain  from  mark twain   the cry for a measured river depth of two fathoms  While training  Samuel convinced his younger brother Henry to work with him  Henry was killed on June 21  1858  when the steamboat he was working on  the Pennsylvania  exploded  Twain had foreseen this death in a dream a month earlier  17  which inspired his interest in parapsychology  he was an early member of the Society for Psychical Research  18  Twain was guilt stricken and held himself responsible for the rest of his life  He continued to work on the river and was a river pilot until the American Civil War broke out in 1861 and traffic along the Mississippi was curtailed  During the Civil War  Missouri was considered by many to be part of the South and was represented in both the Confederate and Federal governments  Twain wrote a sketch   The Private History of a Campaign That Failed   which claimed he and his friends had been Confederate volunteers for two weeks before disbanding their company  19  Travels Library of Twain House  with hand stenciled paneling  fireplaces from India  embossed wallpapers  and hand carved mantel purchased in Scotland Twain joined Orion  who in 1861 became secretary to James W  Nye  the governor of Nevada Territory  and headed west  Twain and his brother traveled more than two weeks on a stagecoach across the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains  visiting the Mormon community in Salt Lake City  The experiences inspired Roughing It and provided material for The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County  Twain s journey ended in the silver mining town of Virginia City  Nevada  where he became a miner  19  Twain failed as a miner and worked at a Virginia City newspaper  the Territorial Enterprise  20  Here he first used his pen name  On February 3  1863  he signed a humorous travel account  Letter From Carson   re  Joe Goodman  party at Gov  Johnson s  music  with  Mark Twain   21  Twain moved to San Francisco  California in 1864  still as a journalist  He met writers such as Bret Harte  Artemus Ward  and Dan DeQuille  The young poet Ina Coolbrith may have romanced him  22  His first success as a writer came when his humorous tall tale   The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County   was published in a New York weekly  The Saturday Press  on November 18  1865  It brought him national attention  A year later  he traveled to the Sandwich Islands  present day Hawaii  as a reporter for the Sacramento Union  His travelogues were popular and became the basis for his first lectures  23  In 1867  a local newspaper funded a trip to the Mediterranean  During his tour of Europe and the Middle East  he wrote a popular collection of travel letters  which were later compiled as The Innocents Abroad in 1869  It was on this trip that he met his future brother in law  Charles Langdon  Both were passengers aboard the Quaker City on their way to the Holy Land  Langdon showed a picture of his sister Olivia to Twain  Twain claimed to have fallen in love at first sight  Upon returning to the United States  Twain was offered honorary membership in the secret society Scroll and Key of Yale University in 1868  24  Its devotion to  fellowship  moral and literary self improvement  and charity  suited him well  Marriage and children Twain in 1867 Throughout 1868  Twain and Olivia Langdon corresponded but she rejected his first marriage proposal  Two months later  they were engaged  In February 1870  Twain and Langdon were married in Elmira  New York  23  where he had courted her  She came from a  wealthy but liberal family   and through her he met abolitionists   socialists  principled atheists and activists for women s rights and social equality   including Harriet Beecher Stowe  his next door neighbor in Hartford  Connecticut   Frederick Douglass  and the writer and utopian socialist William Dean Howells  25  who became a long time friend  The couple lived in Buffalo  New York from 1869 to 1871  Twain owned a stake in the Buffalo Express newspaper and worked as an editor and writer  While living in Buffalo  their son Langdon died of diphtheria at 19 months  They had three daughters  Susy  1872 1896   Clara  1874 1962  26  and Jean  1880 1909   The couple s marriage lasted 34 years  until Olivia s death in 1904  All of the Clemens family are buried in Elmira s Woodlawn Cemetery  Twain moved his family to Hartford  Connecticut  where starting in 1873  he arranged the building of a home  local admirers saved it from demolition in 1927 and eventually turned it into a museum focused on him   In the 1870s and 1880s  Twain and his family summered at Quarry Farm  the home of Olivia s sister  Susan Crane  27  28  In 1874  27  Susan had a study built apart from the main house so that her brother in law would have a quiet place in which to write  Also  Twain smoked pipes constantly  and Susan Crane did not wish him to do so in her house  During his seventeen years in Hartford  1874 1891  and over twenty summers at Quarry Farm  Twain wrote many of his classic novels  among them The Adventures of Tom Sawyer  1876   The Prince and the Pauper  1881   Life on the Mississippi  1883   Adventures of Huckleberry Finn  1885  and A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur s Court  1889   Twain made a second tour of Europe  described in the 1880 book A Tramp Abroad  His tour included a stay in Heidelberg from May 6 until July 23  1878  and a visit to London  Love of science and technology Twain in the lab of Nikola Tesla  early 1894 Twain was fascinated with science and scientific inquiry  He developed a close and lasting friendship with Nikola Tesla  and the two spent much time together in Tesla s laboratory  Twain patented three inventions  including an  Improvement in Adjustable and Detachable Straps for Garments   to replace suspenders  and a history trivia game  29  Most commercially successful was a self pasting scrapbook  a dried adhesive on the pages only needed to be moistened before use  His book A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur s Court features a time traveler from contemporary America  using his knowledge of science to introduce modern technology to Arthurian England  This type of storyline would later become a common feature of a science fiction sub genre  alternate history  In 1909  Thomas Edison visited Twain at his home in Redding  Connecticut and filmed him  Part of the footage was used in The Prince and the Pauper  1909   a two reel short film  Financial troubles Twain made a substantial amount of money through his writing  but he lost a great deal through investments  mostly in new inventions and technology  particularly the Paige typesetting machine  It was a beautifully engineered mechanical marvel that amazed viewers when it worked  but was prone to breakdowns  Twain spent  300 000  equal to  8 058 462 today 30   on it between 1880 and 1894  31  but before it could be perfected  it was made obsolete by the Linotype  He lost not only the bulk of his book profits but also a substantial portion of his wife s inheritance  32  Twain also lost money through his publishing house  which enjoyed initial success selling the memoirs of Ulysses S  Grant  but went broke soon after  losing money on a biography of Pope Leo XIII  fewer than two hundred copies were sold  32  Twain s writings and lectures  combined with the help of a new friend  enabled him to recover financially  33  In 1893  he began a 15 year long friendship with financier Henry Huttleston Rogers  a principal of Standard Oil  Rogers first made Twain file for bankruptcy  Then Rogers had Twain transfer the copyrights on his written works to his wife  Olivia  to prevent creditors from gaining possession of them  Finally  Rogers took absolute charge of Twain s money until all the creditors were paid  Twain embarked on a year long  around the world lecture tour in July 1895 34  to pay off his creditors in full  although he was no longer under any legal obligation to do so  35  It would be a long  arduous journey and he was sick much of the time  mostly from a cold and a carbuncle  The itinerary took him to Hawaii  Fiji  Australia  New Zealand  Sri Lanka  India  Mauritius  South Africa and England  Twain s three months in India became the centerpiece of his 712 page book Following the Equator  In mid 1900  he was the guest of newspaper proprietor Hugh Gilzean Reid at Dollis Hill House  Twain wrote of Dollis Hill that he had  never seen any place that was so satisfactorily situated  with its noble trees and stretch of country  and everything that went to make life delightful  and all within a biscuit s throw of the metropolis of the world   36  He then returned to America in 1900  having earned enough to pay off his debts  Speaking engagements Twain was in demand as a featured speaker  performing solo humorous talks similar to what would become stand up comedy  37  He gave paid talks to many men s clubs  including the Authors  Club  Beefsteak Club  Vagabonds  White Friars  and Monday Evening Club of Hartford  He was made an honorary member of the Bohemian Club in San Francisco  In the late 1890s  he spoke to the Savage Club in London and was elected honorary member  When told that only three men had been so honored  including the Prince of Wales  he replied  Well  it must make the Prince feel mighty fine   38  In 1897  Twain spoke to the Concordia Press Club in Vienna as a special guest  following diplomat Charlemagne Tower  Jr   In German  to the great amusement of the assemblage  Twain delivered the speech  Die Schrecken der deutschen Sprache    The Horrors of the German Language    39  Later life and death Twain passed through a period of deep depression  which began in 1896 when his daughter Susy died of meningitis  Olivia s death in 1904 and Jean s on December 24  1909  deepened his gloom  40  On May 20  1909  his close friend Henry Rogers died suddenly  In 1906  Twain began his autobiography in the North American Review  In April  Twain heard that his friend Ina Coolbrith had lost nearly all she owned in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake  and he volunteered a few autographed portrait photographs to be sold for her benefit  To further aid Coolbrith  George Wharton James visited Twain in New York and arranged for a new portrait session  Initially resistant  Twain admitted that four of the resulting images were the finest ones ever taken of him  41  Twain formed a club in 1906 for girls he viewed as surrogate granddaughters  the Angel Fish and Aquarium Club  The dozen or so members ranged in age from 10 to 16  Twain exchanged letters with his  Angel Fish  girls and invited them to concerts and the theatre and to play games  Twain wrote in 1908 that the club was his  life s chief delight   42  Oxford University awarded Twain an honorary doctorate in letters  D Litt   in 1907  Mark Twain headstone in Woodlawn Cemetery  In 1909  Twain is quoted as saying  43   I came in with Halley s Comet in 1835  It is coming again next year  and I expect to go out with it  It will be the greatest disappointment of my life if I don t go out with Halley s Comet  The Almighty has said  no doubt   Now here are these two unaccountable freaks  they came in together  they must go out together   His prediction was accurate   Twain died of a heart attack on April 21  1910  in Redding  Connecticut  one day after the comet s closest approach to Earth  Upon hearing of Twain s death  President William Howard Taft said  44  45   Mark Twain gave pleasure   real intellectual enjoyment   to millions  and his works will continue to give such pleasure to millions yet to come    His humor was American  but he was nearly as much appreciated by Englishmen and people of other countries as by his own countrymen  He has made an enduring part of American literature   Twain s funeral was at the  Old Brick  Presbyterian Church in New York  46  He is buried in his wife s family plot at Woodlawn Cemetery in Elmira  New York  His grave is marked by a 12 foot  i e   two fathoms  or  mark twain   monument  placed there by his surviving daughter  Clara  47  There is also a smaller headstone  Writing Overview Mark Twain in his gown  scarlet with grey sleeves and facings  for his D Litt  degree  awarded to him by Oxford University Twain began his career writing light  humorous verse  but evolved into a chronicler of the vanities  hypocrisies and murderous acts of mankind  At mid career  with Huckleberry Finn  he combined rich humor  sturdy narrative and social criticism  Twain was a master at rendering colloquial speech and helped to create and popularize a distinctive American literature built on American themes and language  Many of Twain s works have been suppressed at times for various reasons  Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has been repeatedly restricted in American high schools  not least for its frequent use of the word  nigger   which was in common usage in the pre Civil War period in which the novel was set  A complete bibliography of his works is nearly impossible to compile because of the vast number of pieces written by Twain  often in obscure newspapers  and his use of several different pen names  Additionally  a large portion of his speeches and lectures have been lost or were not written down  thus  the collection of Twain s works is an ongoing process  Researchers rediscovered published material by Twain as recently as 1995  32  Early journalism and travelogues Cabin where Twain wrote  Jumping Frog of Calaveras County   Jackass Hill  Tuolumne County  Click on historical marker and interior view  While writing for the Virginia City newspaper  the Territorial Enterprise in 1863  Clemens met lawyer Tom Fitch  editor of the competing newspaper Virginia Daily Union and known as the  silver tongued orator of the Pacific   48  51 He credited Fitch with giving him his  first really profitable lesson  in writing  In 1866  Clemens presented his lecture on the Sandwich Islands to a crowd in Washoe City  Nevada  49  Clemens commented that   When I first began to lecture  and in my earlier writings  my sole idea was to make comic capital out of everything I saw and heard   Fitch told him   Clemens  your lecture was magnificent  It was eloquent  moving  sincere  Never in my entire life have I listened to such a magnificent piece of descriptive narration  But you committed one unpardonable sin the unpardonable sin  It is a sin you must never commit again  You closed a most eloquent description  by which you had keyed your audience up to a pitch of the intensest interest  with a piece of atrocious anti climax which nullified all the really fine effect you had produced   50  It was in these days that Twain became a writer of the Sagebrush School  and was known later as the most notable within this literary genre  51  Twain s first important work   The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County   was first published in the New York Saturday Press on November 18  1865  The only reason it was published there was that his story arrived too late to be included in a book Artemus Ward was compiling featuring sketches of the wild American West  After this burst of popularity  the Sacramento Union commissioned Twain to write letters about his travel experiences  The first journey he took for this job was to ride the steamer Ajax in its maiden voyage to Hawaii  referred to at the time as the Sandwich Islands  These humorous letters proved the genesis to his work with the San Francisco Alta California newspaper  which designated him a traveling correspondent for a trip from San Francisco to New York City via the Panama isthmus  All the while  Twain was writing letters meant for publishing back and forth  chronicling his experiences with his burlesque humor  On June 8  1867  Twain set sail on the pleasure cruiser Quaker City for five months  This trip resulted in The Innocents Abroad or The New Pilgrims  Progress  This book is a record of a pleasure trip  If it were a record of a solemn scientific expedition it would have about it the gravity  that profundity  and that impressive incomprehensibility which are so proper to works of that kind  and withal so attractive  Yet not withstanding it is only a record of a picnic  it has a purpose  which is  to suggest to the reader how he would be likely to see Europe and the East if he looked at them with his own eyes instead of the eyes of those who traveled in those countries before him  I make small pretense of showing anyone how he ought to look at objects of interest beyond the sea   other books do that  and therefore  even if I were competent to do it  there is no need  In 1872  Twain published a second piece of travel literature  Roughing It  as a semi sequel to Innocents  Roughing It is a semi autobiographical account of Twain s journey to Nevada and his subsequent life in the American West  The book lampoons American and Western society in the same way that Innocents critiqued the various countries of Europe and the Middle East  Twain s next work kept Roughing It s focus on American society but focused more on the events of the day  Entitled The Gilded Age  A Tale of Today  it was not a travel piece  as his previous two books had been  and it was his first attempt at writing a novel  The book is also notable because it is Twain s only collaboration  it was written with his neighbor Charles Dudley Warner  Twain s next two works drew on his experiences on the Mississippi River  Old Times on the Mississippi  a series of sketches published in the Atlantic Monthly in 1875  featured Twain s disillusionment with Romanticism  52 Old Times eventually became the starting point for Life on the Mississippi  Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn Twain s next major publication was The Adventures of Tom Sawyer  which drew on his youth in Hannibal  Tom Sawyer was modeled on Twain as a child  with traces of two schoolmates  John Briggs and Will Bowen  The book also introduced in a supporting role Huckleberry Finn  based on Twain s boyhood friend Tom Blankenship  The Prince and the Pauper  despite a storyline that is omnipresent in film and literature today  was not as well received  Telling the story of two boys born on the same day who are physically identical  the book acts as a social commentary as the prince and pauper switch places  Pauper was Twain s first attempt at historical fiction  and blame for its shortcomings is usually put on Twain for having not been experienced enough in English society  and also on the fact that it was produced after a massive hit  In between the writing of Pauper  Twain had started Adventures of Huckleberry Finn  which he consistently had problems completing 53   and started and completed another travel book  A Tramp Abroad  which follows Twain as he traveled through central and southern Europe  Twain s next major published work  Adventures of Huckleberry Finn  solidified him as a noteworthy American writer  Some have called it the first Great American Novel  and the book has become required reading in many schools throughout the United States  Huckleberry Finn was an offshoot from Tom Sawyer and had a more serious tone than its predecessor  The main premise behind Huckleberry Finn is the young boy s belief in the right thing to do though most believed that it was wrong  Four hundred manuscript pages of Huckleberry Finn were written in mid 1876  right after the publication of Tom Sawyer  Some accounts have Twain taking seven years off after his first burst of creativity  eventually finishing the book in 1883  Other accounts have Twain working on Huckleberry Finn in tandem with The Prince and the Pauper and other works in 1880 and other years  The last fifth of Huckleberry Finn is subject to much controversy  Some say that Twain experienced  as critic Leo Marx puts it  a  failure of nerve   Ernest Hemingway once said of Huckleberry Finn  If you read it  you must stop where the Nigger Jim is stolen from the boys  That is the real end  The rest is just cheating  Hemingway also wrote in the same essay  All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn  54  Near the completion of Huckleberry Finn  Twain wrote Life on the Mississippi  which is said to have heavily influenced the former book  32  The work recounts Twain s memories and new experiences after a 22 year absence from the Mississippi  In it  he also states that  Mark Twain  was the call made when the boat was in safe water   two fathoms  12 ft 3 7 m   Later writing After his great work  Twain began turning to his business endeavors to keep them afloat and to stave off the increasing difficulties he had been having from his writing projects  Twain focused on President Ulysses S  Grant s Memoirs for his fledgling publishing company  finding time in between to write  The Private History of a Campaign That Failed  for The Century Magazine  This piece detailed his two week stint in a Confederate militia during the Civil War  The name of his publishing company was Charles L  Webster  amp  Company  which he owned with Charles L  Webster  his nephew by marriage  55  Twain in his later years Twain next focused on A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur s Court  which featured him making his first big pronouncement of disappointment with politics  Written with the same  historical fiction  style of The Prince and the Pauper  A Connecticut Yankee showed the absurdities of political and social norms by setting them in the court of King Arthur  The book was started in December 1885  then shelved a few months later until the summer of 1887  and eventually finished in the spring of 1889  Twain had begun to furiously write articles and commentary with diminishing returns to pay the bills and keep his business projects afloat  but it was not enough  He filed for bankruptcy in 1894  His next large scale work  Pudd nhead Wilson  was written rapidly  as Twain was desperately trying to stave off the bankruptcy  From November 12 to December 14  1893  Twain wrote 60 000 words for the novel  32  Critics have pointed to this rushed completion as the cause of the novel s rough organization and constant disruption of continuous plot  There were parallels between this work and Twain s financial failings  notably his desire to escape his current constraints and become a different person  Like The Prince and the Pauper  this novel also contains the tale of two boys born on the same day who switch positions in life  Considering the circumstances of Twain s birth and Halley s Comet  and his strong belief in the paranormal  it is not surprising that these  mystic  connections recur throughout his writing  The actual title is not clearly established  It was first published serially in Century Magazine  and when it was finally published in book form  Pudd nhead Wilson appeared as the main title  however  the disputed  subtitles  make the entire title read  The Tragedy of Pudd nhead Wilson and the Comedy of The Extraordinary Twins  32  Twain s next venture was a work of straight fiction that he called Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc and dedicated to his wife  Twain had long said that this was the work he was most proud of  despite the criticism he received for it  The book had been a dream of his since childhood  He claimed he had found a manuscript detailing the life of Joan of Arc when he was an adolescent  32  This was another piece Twain was convinced would save his publishing company  His financial adviser  Henry Huttleston Rogers  quashed that idea and got Twain out of that business altogether  but the book was published nonetheless  During this time of dire financial straits  Twain published several literary reviews in newspapers to help make ends meet  He famously derided James Fenimore Cooper in his article detailing Cooper s  Literary Offenses   He became an extremely outspoken critic not only of other authors  but also of other critics  suggesting that before praising Cooper s work  Professors Loundsbury  Brander Matthes  and Wilkie Collins  ought to have read some of it   56  Other authors to fall under Twain s attack during this time period  beginning around 1890 until his death  were George Eliot  Jane Austen  and Robert Louis Stevenson  57  In addition to providing a source for the  tooth and claw  style of literary criticism  Twain outlines in several letters and essays what he considers to be  quality writing   He places emphasis on concision  utility of word choice  and realism  he complains that Cooper s Deerslayer purports to be realistic but has several shortcomings   Ironically  several of his works were later criticized for lack of continuity  Adventures of Huckleberry Finn  and organization  Pudd nhead Wilson   Twain s wife died in 1904 while the couple were staying at the Villa di Quarto in Florence  and after an appropriate time Twain allowed himself to publish some works that his wife  a de facto editor and censor throughout his life  had looked down upon  Of these works  The Mysterious Stranger  depicting various visits of Satan to the Earth  is perhaps the best known  This particular work was not published in Twain s lifetime  There were three versions found in his manuscripts made between 1897 and 1905  the Hannibal  Eseldorf  and Print Shop versions  Confusion between the versions led to an extensive publication of a jumbled version  and only recently have the original versions as Twain wrote them become available  Twain s last work was his autobiography  which he dictated and thought would be most entertaining if he went off on whims and tangents in non chronological order  Some archivists and compilers have rearranged the biography into more conventional forms  thereby eliminating some of Twain s humor and the flow of the book  The first volume of autobiography  over 736 pages  was published by the University of California in November 2010  100 years after his death as Twain wished  58  59  It soon became an unexpected 60  best selling book  61  making Twain one of very few authors publishing new best selling volumes in all 3 of the 19th  20th  and 21st centuries  Friendship with Henry H  Rogers A late life friendship for each  Mark Twain and Henry Huttleston Rogers in 1908 While Twain credited Henry H  Rogers  a Standard Oil executive  with saving him from financial ruin  their close friendship in their later years was mutually beneficial  When Twain lost three of his four children and his beloved wife  the Rogers family increasingly became a surrogate family for him  He became a frequent guest at their townhouse in New York City  their 48 room summer home in Fairhaven  Massachusetts  and aboard their steam yacht  the Kanawha  The two men introduced each other to their acquaintances  Twain was an admirer of the remarkable deafblind girl Helen Keller  He first met Keller and her teacher Anne Sullivan at a party in the home of Laurence Hutton in New York City in the winter of 1894  Twain introduced them to Rogers  who  with his wife  paid for Keller s education at Radcliffe College  Twain is credited with labeling Sullivan  Keller s governess and companion  a  miracle worker   His choice of words later became inspiration for the title of William Gibson s play and film adaptation  The Miracle Worker  Twain also introduced Rogers to journalist Ida M  Tarbell  who interviewed him for a muckraking expose that led indirectly to the breakup of the Standard Oil Trust  On cruises aboard the Kanawha  Twain and Rogers were joined at frequent intervals by Booker T  Washington  the famed former slave who had become a leading educator  While the two famous old men were widely regarded as drinking and poker buddies  they also exchanged letters when apart  and this was often since each traveled a great deal  Unlike Rogers  personal files  which have never become public  these insightful letters were published  62  The written exchanges between the two men demonstrate Twain s well known sense of humor and  more surprisingly  Rogers  sense of fun  providing a rare insight into the private side of the robber baron  In April 1907  Twain and Rogers cruised to the opening of the Jamestown Exposition in Virginia  Twain s public popularity was such that many fans took boats out to the Kanawha at anchor in hopes of getting a glimpse of him  As the gathering of boats around the yacht became a safety hazard  he finally obliged by coming on deck and waving to the crowds  Because of poor weather conditions  the steam yacht was delayed for several days from venturing into the Atlantic Ocean  Rogers and some of the others in his party returned to New York by rail  Twain disliked train travel and so elected to wait and return on the Kanawha  However  reporters lost track of his whereabouts  when he failed to return to New York City as scheduled  The New York Times speculated that he might have been  lost at sea   Upon arriving safely in New York and learning of this  the humorist wrote a satirical article about the episode  offering to     make an exhaustive investigation of this report that I have been lost at sea  If there is any foundation for the report  I will at once apprise the anxious public   63  This bore similarities to an earlier event in 1897 when he made his famous remark  The report of my death was an exaggeration   after a reporter was sent to investigate whether he had died  In fact  it was his cousin who was seriously ill  Later that year  Twain and Rogers s son  Henry Jr   returned to the Jamestown Exposition aboard the Kanawha  The humorist helped host Robert Fulton Day on September 23  1907  celebrating the centennial of Fulton s invention of the steamboat  Twain  filling in for ailing former U S  President Grover Cleveland  introduced Rear Admiral Purnell Harrington  Twain was met with a five minute standing ovation  members of the audience cheered and waved their hats and umbrellas  Deeply touched  Twain said   When you appeal to my head  I don t feel it  but when you appeal to my heart  I do feel it   64  In April 1909  the two old friends returned to Norfolk  Virginia for the banquet in honor of Rogers and his newly completed Virginian Railway  Twain was the keynote speaker in one of his last public appearances  and was widely quoted in newspapers across the country  65  A month later  Twain was en route from Connecticut to visit his friend in New York City when Rogers died suddenly on May 20  1909  Twain arrived at Grand Central Station to be met by his daughter with the news  Stricken with grief  he uncustomarily avoided news reporters who had gathered  saying only  This is terrible   I cannot talk about it   Two days later  he served as an honorary pallbearer at the funeral in New York City  However  he declined to join the funeral party on the train ride for the interment at Fairhaven  He said  I cannot bear to travel with my friend and not converse   Views Twain s views became more radical as he grew older  He acknowledged that his views changed and developed over his life  referring to one of his favorite works  When I finished Carlyle s French Revolution in 1871  I was a Girondin  every time I have read it since  I have read it differently   being influenced and changed  little by little  by life and environment     and now I lay the book down once more  and recognize that I am a Sansculotte    And not a pale  characterless Sansculotte  but a Marat  66  Anti imperialist In the New York Herald  October 15  1900  he describes his transformation and political awakening  in the context of the Philippine American War  from being  a red hot imperialist   I wanted the American eagle to go screaming into the Pacific    Why not spread its wings over the Philippines  I asked myself      I said to myself  Here are a people who have suffered for three centuries  We can make them as free as ourselves  give them a government and country of their own  put a miniature of the American Constitution afloat in the Pacific  start a brand new republic to take its place among the free nations of the world  It seemed to me a great task to which we had addressed ourselves  But I have thought some more  since then  and I have read carefully the treaty of Paris  which ended the Spanish American War   and I have seen that we do not intend to free  but to subjugate the people of the Philippines  We have gone there to conquer  not to redeem  It should  it seems to me  be our pleasure and duty to make those people free  and let them deal with their own domestic questions in their own way  And so I am an anti imperialist  I am opposed to having the eagle put its talons on any other land  67  Before 1899 Twain was an ardent imperialist  In the late 1860s and early 1870s he spoke out strongly in favor of American interests in the Hawaiian Islands  68  In the mid 1890s he explained later  he was  a red hot imperialist  I wanted the American eagle to go screaming over the Pacific   69  He said the war with Spain in 1898 was  the worthiest  war ever fought  70  In 1899 he reversed course  and from 1901  soon after his return from Europe  until his death in 1910  Twain was vice president of the American Anti Imperialist League  71  which opposed the annexation of the Philippines by the United States and had  tens of thousands of members   25  He wrote many political pamphlets for the organization  The Incident in the Philippines  posthumously published in 1924  was in response to the Moro Crater Massacre  in which six hundred Moros were killed  Many of his neglected and previously uncollected writings on anti imperialism appeared for the first time in book form in 1992  71  Twain was critical of imperialism in other countries as well  In Following the Equator  Twain expresses  hatred and condemnation of imperialism of all stripes   25  He was highly critical of European imperialism  notably of Cecil Rhodes  who greatly expanded the British Empire  and of Leopold II  King of the Belgians  25 King Leopold s Soliloquy is a stinging political satire about his private colony  the Congo Free State  Reports of outrageous exploitation and grotesque abuses led to widespread international protest in the early 1900s  arguably the first large scale human rights movement  In the soliloquy  the King argues that bringing Christianity to the country outweighs a little starvation  Leopold s rubber gatherers were tortured  maimed and slaughtered  until the movement forced Brussels to call a halt  72  73  During the Philippine American War  Twain wrote a short pacifist story entitled The War Prayer  which makes the point that humanism and Christianity s preaching of love are incompatible with the conduct of war  It was submitted to Harper s Bazaar for publication  but on March 22  1905 the magazine rejected the story as  not quite suited to a woman s magazine   Eight days later  Twain wrote to his friend Daniel Carter Beard  to whom he had read the story   I don t think the prayer will be published in my time  None but the dead are permitted to tell the truth   Because he had an exclusive contract with Harper  amp  Brothers  Twain could not publish The War Prayer elsewhere  it remained unpublished until 1923  It was republished as campaigning material by Vietnam War protesters  25  Twain acknowledged he originally sympathized with the more moderate Girondins of the French Revolution and then shifted his sympathies to the more radical Sansculottes  indeed identifying as  a Marat   Twain supported the revolutionaries in Russia against the reformists  arguing that the Tsar must be got rid of  by violent means  because peaceful ones would not work  74  He summed up his views of revolutions in the following statement  I am said to be a revolutionist in my sympathies  by birth  by breeding and by principle  I am always on the side of the revolutionists  because there never was a revolution unless there were some oppressive and intolerable conditions against which to revolute  75  Civil rights Twain was an adamant supporter of abolition and emancipation  even going so far to say  Lincoln s Proclamation     not only set the black slaves free  but set the white man free also   76  He argued that non whites did not receive justice in the United States  once saying  I have seen Chinamen abused and maltreated in all the mean  cowardly ways possible to the invention of a degraded nature    but I never saw a Chinaman righted in a court of justice for wrongs thus done to him   77  He paid for at least one black person to attend Yale University Law School and for another black person to attend a southern university to become a minister  78  Mark Twain was a staunch supporter of women s rights and an active campaigner for women s suffrage  His  Votes for Women  speech  in which he pressed for the granting of voting rights to women  is considered one of the most famous in history  79  Helen Keller benefited from Twain s support  as she pursued her college education and publishing  despite her disabilities and financial limitations  Twain s views on race were not reflected in his early sketches of Native Americans  Of them  Twain wrote in 1870  His heart is a cesspool of falsehood  of treachery  and of low and devilish instincts  With him  gratitude is an unknown emotion  and when one does him a kindness  it is safest to keep the face toward him  lest the reward be an arrow in the back  To accept of a favor from him is to assume a debt which you can never repay to his satisfaction  though you bankrupt yourself trying  The scum of the earth  80  As counterpoint  Twain s essay on  The Literary Offenses of Fenimore Cooper  offers a much kinder view of Indians  56   No  other Indians would have noticed these things  but Cooper s Indians never notice anything  Cooper thinks they are marvelous creatures for noticing  but he was almost always in error about his Indians  There was seldom a sane one among them   81  In his later travelogue Following the Equator  1897   Twain observes that in colonized lands all over the world   savages  have always been wronged by  whites  in the most merciless ways  such as  robbery  humiliation  and slow  slow murder  through poverty and the white man s whiskey   his conclusion is that  there are many humorous things in this world  among them the white man s notion that he is less savage than the other savages   82  Labor Twain wrote glowingly about unions in the riverboating industry in Life on the Mississippi  which was read in union halls decades later  83  He supported the labor movement  especially one of the most important unions  the Knights of Labor  25  In a speech to them  he said  Who are the oppressors  The few  the King  the capitalist  and a handful of other overseers and superintendents  Who are the oppressed  The many  the nations of the earth  the valuable personages  the workers  they that make the bread that the soft handed and idle eat  84  Vivisection Twain was opposed to the vivisection practices of his day  His objection was not on a scientific basis but rather an ethical one  He specifically cited the pain caused to the animal as his basis of his opposition  85  I am not interested to know whether vivisection produces results that are profitable to the human race or doesn t      The pain which it inflicts upon unconsenting animals is the basis of my enmity toward it  and it is to me sufficient justification of the enmity without looking further  Religion Although Twain was a Presbyterian  he was sometimes critical of organized religion and certain elements of Christianity through his later life  He wrote  for example   Faith is believing what you know ain t so   and  If Christ were here now there is one thing he would not be   a Christian   86  Nonetheless  as a mature adult he engaged in religious discussions and attended services  his theology developing as he wrestled with the deaths of loved ones and his own mortality  87  His own experiences and suffering of his family made him particularly critical of  faith healing   such as espoused by Mary Baker Eddy and Christian Science  His more inflammatory works on religion require a nuanced understanding of his theological arguments and criticism  87  Twain generally avoided publishing his most heretical opinions on religion in his lifetime  and they are known from essays and stories that were published later  In the essay Three Statements of the Eighties in the 1880s  Twain stated that he believed in an almighty God  but not in any messages  revelations  holy scriptures such as the Bible  Providence  or retribution in the afterlife  He did state that  the goodness  the justice  and the mercy of God are manifested in His works   but also that  the universe is governed by strict and immutable laws   which determine  small matters   such as who dies in a pestilence  88  At other times he wrote or spoke in ways that contradicted a strict deist view  for example  plainly professing a belief in Providence  89  In some later writings in the 1890s  he was less optimistic about the goodness of God  observing that  if our Maker is all powerful for good or evil  He is not in His right mind   At other times  he conjectured sardonically that perhaps God had created the world with all its tortures for some purpose of His own  but was otherwise indifferent to humanity  which was too petty and insignificant to deserve His attention anyway  90  Main article  Twain Ament Indemnities Controversy In 1901 Twain criticized the actions of missionary Dr  William Scott Ament  1851 1909  because Ament and other missionaries had collected indemnities from Chinese subjects in the aftermath of the Boxer Uprising of 1900  Twain s response to hearing of Ament s methods was published in the North American Review in February 1901  To the Person Sitting in Darkness  and deals with examples of imperialism in China  South Africa  and with the U S  occupation of the Philippines  91  A subsequent article   To My Missionary Critics  published in The North American Review in April 1901  unapologetically continues his attack  but with the focus shifted from Ament to his missionary superiors  the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions  92  After his death  Twain s family suppressed some of his work that was especially irreverent toward conventional religion  notably Letters from the Earth  which was not published until his daughter Clara reversed her position in 1962 in response to Soviet propaganda about the withholding  93  The anti religious The Mysterious Stranger was published in 1916  Little Bessie  a story ridiculing Christianity  was first published in the 1972 collection Mark Twain s Fables of Man  94  Despite these views  he raised money to build a Presbyterian Church in Nevada in 1864  although it has been argued that it was only by his association with his Presbyterian brother that he did that  95  Twain created a reverent portrayal of Joan of Arc  a subject over which he had obsessed for forty years  studied for a dozen years and spent two years writing  96  In 1900 and again in 1908  he stated   I like Joan of Arc best of all my books  it is the best    96  97  Those who knew Twain well late in life recount that he dwelt on the subject of the afterlife  his daughter Clara saying   Sometimes he believed death ended everything  but most of the time he felt sure of a life beyond   98  Mark Twain s frankest views on religion appeared in his final Autobiography  which was published 100 years after his death  in November 2010  In it  he said  99  There is one notable thing about our Christianity  bad  bloody  merciless  money grabbing  and predatory as it is  in our country particularly and in all other Christian countries in a somewhat modified degree  it is still a hundred times better than the Christianity of the Bible  with its prodigious crime  the invention of Hell  Measured by our Christianity of to day  bad as it is  hypocritical as it is  empty and hollow as it is  neither the Deity nor his Son is a Christian  nor qualified for that moderately high place  Ours is a terrible religion  The fleets of the world could swim in spacious comfort in the innocent blood it has spilled  Twain was a Freemason  100  101  He belonged to Polar Star Lodge No  79 A F  amp A M   based in St  Louis  He was initiated an Entered Apprentice on May 22  1861  passed to the degree of Fellow Craft on June 12  and raised to the degree of Master Mason on July 10  Pen names Twain used different pen names before deciding on   Mark Twain   He signed humorous and imaginative sketches as  Josh  until 1863  Additionally  he used the pen name  Thomas Jefferson Snodgrass  for a series of humorous letters  102  He maintained that his primary pen name came from his years working on Mississippi riverboats  where two fathoms  a depth indicating safe water for passage of boat  was measured on the sounding line  Twain is an archaic term for  two   The riverboatman s cry was  mark twain  or  more fully   by the mark twain   meaning  according to the mark  on the line    the depth is  two  fathoms    that is   The water is 12 feet  3 7 m  deep and it is safe to pass   Twain claimed that his famous pen name was not entirely his invention  In Life on the Mississippi  he wrote  Captain Isaiah Sellers was not of literary turn or capacity  but he used to jot down brief paragraphs of plain practical information about the river  and sign them  MARK TWAIN   and give them to the New Orleans Picayune  They related to the stage and condition of the river  and were accurate and valuable      At the time that the telegraph brought the news of his death  I was on the Pacific coast  I was a fresh new journalist  and needed a nom de guerre  so I confiscated the ancient mariner s discarded one  and have done my best to make it remain what it was in his hands   a sign and symbol and warrant that whatever is found in its company may be gambled on as being the petrified truth  how I have succeeded  it would not be modest in me to say  103  Twain s story about his pen name has been questioned by biographer George Williams III  104  the Territorial Enterprise newspaper  105  and Purdue University s Paul Fatout  106  The claim is that  mark twain  refers to a running bar tab that Twain would regularly incur while drinking at John Piper s saloon in Virginia City  Nevada  Honors Twain statue at Finney County Public Library in Garden City  Kansas Twain s legacy lives on today as his namesakes continue to multiply  Several schools are named after him  including Mark Twain Elementary School in Houston  Texas  which has a statue of Twain sitting on a bench  and Mark Twain Intermediate School in New York  There are several schools named Mark Twain Middle School in different states  as well as Samuel Clemens High School in Schertz  near San Antonio  Texas  There are also other structures  such as the Mark Twain Memorial Bridge  Mark Twain Village is a United States Army installation located in the S dstadt district of Heidelberg  Germany  It is one of two American bases in the United States Army Garrison Heidelberg that house American soldiers and their families  the other being Patrick Henry Village   Awards in his name proliferate  In 1998  The John F  Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts created the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor  awarded annually  The Mark Twain Award is an award given annually to a book for children in grades four through eight by the Missouri Association of School Librarians

stamped envelope for  Mark Twain and Halley s Comet   noting the connection with Twain s birth  his death  and the comet  109  On June 25  2011  the Postal Service released a Forever stamp in his honor  110  Depictions Main article  Mark Twain in popular culture Twain is often depicted wearing a white suit  While there is evidence that suggests that  after Livy s death in 1904  Twain began wearing white suits on the lecture circuit  modern representations suggesting that he wore them throughout his life are unfounded  However  there is evidence of him wearing a white suit before 1904  In 1882  he sent a photograph of himself in a white suit to 18 year old Edward W  Bok  later publisher of the Ladies Home Journal  with a handwritten dated note on verso  It did eventually become his trademark  as illustrated in anecdotes about this eccentricity  such as the time he wore a white summer suit to a Congressional hearing during the winter   32  McMasters  The Mark Twain Encyclopedia states that Twain did not wear a white suit in his last three years  except at one banquet speech  111  Actor Hal Holbrook created a one man show called Mark Twain Tonight  which he has performed regularly for about 57 years  112  The broadcast by CBS in 1967 won him an Emmy Award  Of the three runs on Broadway  1966  1977  and 2005   the first won him a Tony Award  Twain was portrayed by Fredric March in the 1944 film The Adventures of Mark Twain  Bibliography Main article  Mark Twain bibliography See also American Literary Regionalism American realism Christian Science  essay
