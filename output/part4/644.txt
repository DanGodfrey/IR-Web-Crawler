Same sex marriage in the United States From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search Civil same sex marriage ceremony being performed in San Francisco City Hall Same sex marriage in the United States is not recognized by the federal government  but such marriages are recognized by some individual states  The lack of federal recognition was codified in 1996 by the Defense of Marriage Act  before Massachusetts became the first state to grant marriage licenses to same sex couples in 2004  Such licenses are granted by six states  Connecticut  Iowa  Massachusetts  New Hampshire  New York  and Vermont  plus Washington  D C  and Oregon s Coquille and Washington state s Suquamish Indian tribes  The states of Washington 1  and Maryland have passed laws to begin granting same sex marriage licenses during 2012  but each may be delayed or derailed by November 2012 voter referenda  Same sex marriages could be legally performed in California between June 16  2008  and November 4  2008  after which voters passed Proposition 8 prohibiting same sex marriages  California also recognizes any same sex marriage from around the world that took place before that end date  while Maryland recognizes all same sex marriages from other jurisdictions  2  3  The legalization of same sex marriage has been achieved by court rulings and legislative action  but not through voter referendums  4  5  6  7  As of June 2011 update   12 states prohibit same sex marriage via statute and 29 via the state s constitution  8  The movement to obtain marriage rights and benefits for same sex couples in the United States began in the early 1970s  9  The issue became more prominent in U S  politics in 1993 when the Hawaii Supreme Court decided Baehr v  Lewin  holding that the state s ban probably violated the state s Constitution   which prompted the U S  Congress to pass the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996  Through the first decade of the 21st century  public support for its legalization grew considerably  10  and contemporary polls show that a majority of Americans support same sex marriage  11  12  13  14  Legal recognition of same sex relationships Marriage

marriage in the United States are complicated by the nation s federal system of government  Prior to 1996  the federal government did not define marriage  any marriage recognized by a state was recognized by the federal government  even if that marriage was not recognized by one or more other states  as was the case with interracial marriage before 1967 due to anti miscegenation laws   With the passage of the Defense of Marriage Act  DOMA  in 1996  however  a marriage was explicitly defined in federal law as a union of one man and one woman   See 1 U S C    7   DOMA has been under challenge in the federal courts  and on July 8  2010  Judge Joseph Tauro of the District Court of Massachusetts held that the denial of federal rights and benefits to lawfully married Massachusetts same sex couples under the DOMA is unconstitutional  under the Tenth Amendment to the US Constitution  15  16  This ruling is currently under a stay  but would affect residents residing within the federal district that covers Massachusetts if the stay is lifted  If this decision is appealed and affirmed  the ruling could apply elsewhere in the U S  For now  no act or agency of the federal government except within the state of Massachusetts if the stay is lifted may recognize same sex marriage  According to the federal government s Government Accountability Office  GAO   more than 1 138 rights and protections are conferred to U S  citizens upon marriage by the federal government  areas affected include Social Security benefits  veterans  benefits  health insurance  Medicaid  hospital visitation  estate taxes  retirement savings  pensions  family leave  and immigration law  17  However  many aspects of marriage law affecting the day to day lives of inhabitants of the United States are determined by the states  not the federal government  and the Defense of Marriage Act does not prevent individual states from defining marriage as they see fit  The United States Supreme Court in 1972 dismissed Baker v  Nelson  a case originating in Minnesota   for want of a substantial federal question   The Defense of Marriage Act  as well as marriage laws in 44 states  could be affected by the outcome of Perry v  Brown  a case challenging the validity of California s Proposition 8 under the United States Constitution  18  State law Further information  Same sex marriage law in the

state level  as the federal Defense of Marriage Act explicitly bars federal recognition of such marriages  Six state governments  along with the District of Columbia  the Coquille Indian Tribe  and the Suquamish tribe  have passed laws offering same sex marriage and currently offer same sex marriages  New York  Massachusetts  Connecticut  Iowa  Vermont  and New Hampshire  In all six states  same sex marriage has been legalized through legislation or court ruling  19  Same sex marriage has been legal in Massachusetts since May 17  2004  in Connecticut since November 12  2008  20  in Iowa since April 27  2009  21  22  in Vermont since September 1  2009  New Hampshire since January 1  2010  and New York since July 24  2011  23  In 2009  New England became the center of an organized push to legalize same sex marriage  24  with four of the six states in that region granting same sex couples the legal right to marry  Out of 28 states where constitutional amendments or initiatives that define marriage as the union of a man and a woman were put on the ballot in a voter referendum  voters in all 28 states voted to approve such amendments  25  Arizonans voted down one such amendment in 2006  26  but approved a different amendment to that effect in 2008  27  In 1998  Hawaiian voters approved language allowing their legislature to ban same sex marriage  28  In 2009  Maine voters prevented legislation permitting same sex marriage from going into effect  29  19  As of January 2010 update   29 states had constitutional provisions restricting marriage to one man and one woman  while 12 others had laws  restricting marriage to one man and one woman   30  Nineteen states ban any legal recognition of same sex unions that would be equivalent to civil marriage  31  Opponents of same sex marriage have worked to prevent individual states from recognizing same sex unions by attempting to amend the United States Constitution to define marriage as a union between one man and one woman  In 2006  the Federal Marriage Amendment  which would prohibit states from recognizing same sex marriages  was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on a party line vote and was debated by the full United States Senate  but was ultimately defeated in both houses of Congress  32  The right to marry was first extended to same sex couples by a United States jurisdiction on November 18  2003  by a state Supreme Judicial Court ruling in Massachusetts  33  On May 15  2008  the Supreme Court of California issued a decision in which it effectively legalized same sex marriage in California  holding that California s existing opposite sex definition of marriage violated the constitutional rights of same sex couples  34  35  Same sex marriage opponents in California placed a state constitutional amendment known as Proposition 8 on the November 2008 ballot for the purpose of restoring an opposite sex definition of marriage  36  Proposition 8 was passed on Election Day 2008  as were proposed marriage limiting amendments in Florida and Arizona  37  On August 4  2010  a decision by the U S  District Court in Perry v  Schwarzenegger ruled Proposition 8 unconstitutional  38  The decision in that case is currently being appealed and the case is ultimately expected to be decided by the U S  Supreme Court  39  On October 10  2008  the Connecticut Supreme Court overturned the state s civil unions statute  2005   as unconstitutionally discriminating against same sex couples  and required the state to recognize same sex marriages  Same sex marriage was legalized in Iowa following the unanimous ruling of the Iowa Supreme Court in Varnum v  Brien on April 3  2009  40  This decision was initially scheduled to take effect on April 24  but the date was changed to April 27 for administrative reasons  22  On April 7  2009  Vermont legalized same sex marriage through legislation  The Governor of Vermont had previously vetoed the measure  but the veto was overridden by the Legislature  Vermont became the first state in the United States to legalize same sex marriage through legislative means rather than litigation  On May 6  2009  Maine Governor John Baldacci signed a law legalizing same sex marriage  becoming the first state governor to do so  41  However  the legislation was stayed pending a vote and never went into effect  It was repealed by referendum in November 2009  19  On June 3  2009  New Hampshire became the sixth state to legalize same sex marriage  42  On December 18  2009  a same sex marriage bill was signed into law by the Mayor of the District of Columbia  43  same sex marriage licenses became available in Washington  D C  on March 3  2010  44  California  Colorado  Delaware  Hawaii  Maine  Maryland  Nevada  Oregon  Rhode Island  Wisconsin  Illinois  and Washington have created legal unions for same sex couples that offer varying subsets of the rights and responsibilities of marriage under the laws of those jurisdictions  As of 1 June 2009  2009  06 01  update   New Jersey has created legal unions that  while not called marriages  are explicitly defined as offering all the rights and responsibilities of marriage under state  though not federal  law to same sex couples  Maryland recognizes same sex marriages formed in other jurisdictions  but does not allow forming such marriages within their own borders  2  3  New York had been in a similar situation as its courts had held that same sex marriages conducted in states where they are legal must be recognized by those states  but that the state statutes did not allow the issuance of same sex marriage licenses  45  a situation which changed when its legislature legalized granting licenses to same sex couples in 2011  On February 13  2012  Washington Governor Chris Gregoire signed legislation into law that would institute same sex marriage in the state  effective June 2012  unless forced to a November 2012 voter referendum  46  The laws of New Mexico are largely silent on the subject of same sex marriage  as they do not specifically allow nor prohibit same sex marriages or other types of same sex unions  Debate President Barack Obama has stated that he supports the idea of legalizing same sex marriage 47  although at a personal level his beliefs place him in opposition to it  48  he has recently stated that his current position is  evolving   49  Obama remains sympathetic to the rights of individuals who identify as gay or lesbian  50  In a 1996 newspaper interview  Obama stated  I favor legalizing same sex marriages  and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages   47  However  during the 2008 presidential campaign  Obama stated   I believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman  For me as a Christian  it is a sacred union  You know  God is in the mix   51  One report indicates that Obama may have made comments in support of same sex marriage during his Illinois Senate race in the 1990s  52  The president  supports full civil unions and federal rights for LGBT couples and opposes a constitutional ban on same sex marriage   50  but stated in December 2010 that these civil unions from the perspective of same sex couples are  not enough   49  Obama opposes a federal mandate for same sex marriage  and also opposes the Defense of Marriage Act  53  stating that individual states should decide the issue  54  55  Obama opposed Proposition 8  California s constitutional ban on same sex marriage  in 2008  56  He has stated that he continues to personally wrestle with the issue of same sex marriage  49  Many high profile politicians and commentators have expressed their views on same sex marriage  Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh are two of the most prominent conservative commentators based on recent listenership ratings  57  In an O Reilly Factor interview in August 2010  when Beck was asked if he  believe s  that gay marriage is a threat to  this  country in any way   he stated   No I don t I believe that Thomas Jefferson said   If it neither breaks my leg nor picks my pocket what difference is it to me    58  On his radio show in August 2010  Rush Limbaugh made the following comments on the then recent decision by U S  District Court Judge Vaughn Walker regarding Proposition 8 in California   Marriage  There s a definition of it  for it  It means something  Marriage is a union of a man and woman  It s always been that  If you want to get married and you re a man  marry a woman  Nobody s stopping you  This is about tearing apart an institution   59  Commenting on the same court decision  former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich issued a statement in opposition to same sex marriage  which read  in part  as follows   Judge Walker s ruling overturning Prop 8 is an outrageous disrespect for our Constitution and for the majority of people of the United States who believe marriage is the union of husband and wife    Congress now has the responsibility to act immediately to reaffirm marriage as a union of one man and one woman as our national policy   60  Then Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi expressed her support for Judge Walker s decision   I am extremely encouraged by the ruling today  which found that Proposition 8 violated both the due process and equal protection clauses of the U S  Constitution  Proposition 8 has taken away individual rights and freedoms  and is a stain upon the California Constitution  We must continue to fight against discriminatory marriage amendments and work toward the day when all American families are treated equally   61  In 2009  Pelosi described the difficulty in repealing the Defense of Marriage Act   I would like to get rid of all of it  But the fact is we have to make decisions on what we can pass at a given time  It doesn t mean the other issues are not important  It is a matter of getting the votes and the legislative floor time to do it   62  Congressman Barney Frank voiced his concern in September 2009 with regard to the ability to obtain sufficient votes to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act   If we had a chance to pass that  it would be a different story  but I don t think it s a good idea to rekindle that debate when there s no chance of passage in the near term   63  During the 2008 presidential election campaign  then Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin stated   I have voted along with the vast majority of Alaskans who had the opportunity to vote to amend our Constitution defining marriage as between one man and one woman  I wish on a federal level that that s where we would go because I don t support gay marriage   64  MSNBC commentator Rachel Maddow expressed her frustration with the Obama Administration position on same sex marriage in August 2010  In response to Senior White House Advisor David Axelrod s statement on President Obama s position   The president does oppose same sex marriage but he supports equality for gay and lesbian couples in benefits and other issues   Maddow said   Got that  So the line from the administration is that Barack Obama does not want gay people to be allowed to be married  but when gay people can be married and other people are trying to take away that right like in California  he doesn t want the right to be taken away  But  he s not in favor of that right in the first place  You got it  The president is against gay marriage but he is also against constitutional amendments to ban gay marriage  which means that he d apparently prefer that gay marriage be banned through flimsier tactical means  That s the president s position  Clear as mud  Ripe for criticism much   65  Advocacy groups have entered the same sex marriage debate in recent years  including the National Organization for Marriage  NOM  and the Family Research Council  FRC   which has been designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center  66  NOM lists strategies on its website for supporters to use  including the following statement   Strong majorities of Americans oppose gay marriage  Supporters of SSM therefore seek to change the subject to just about anything  discrimination  benefits  homosexuality  gay rights  federalism  our sacred constitution  Our goal is simple  Shift the conversation rapidly back to marriage  Don t get sidetracked  Marriage is the issue  Marriage is what we care about  Marriage really matters  It s just common sense   67  According to its website  the FRC opposes  the vigorous efforts of homosexual activists to demand that homosexuality be accepted as equivalent to heterosexuality in law  in the media  and in schools  Attempts to join two men or two women in  marriage  constitute a radical redefinition and falsification of the institution  and FRC supports state and federal constitutional amendments to prevent such redefinition by courts or legislatures   68  The Human Rights Campaign  HRC  is one of the leading advocacy groups in support of same sex marriage  According to the HRC s website   Many same sex couples want the right to legally marry because they are in love   many  in fact  have spent the last 10  20 or 50 years with that person   and they want to honor their relationship in the greatest way our society has to offer  by making a public commitment to stand together in good times and bad  through all the joys and challenges family life brings   69  Support See also  List of supporters of same sex marriage in the United States Rally for same sex marriage  May 2009  San Francisco  California  Same sex marriage supporters make several arguments in support of their position  Gail Mathabane likens prohibitions on same sex marriage to past U S  prohibitions on interracial marriage  70  Fernando Espuelas argues that same sex marriage should be allowed because same sex marriage extends a civil right to a minority group  71  According to an American history scholar Nancy Cott  there really is no comparison  because there is nothing that is like marriage except marriage   72  According to the leading associations of psychological  psychiatric  medical  and social work professionals in the United States the claim that legal recognition of marriage for same sex couples undermines the institution of marriage and harms their children is inconsistent with the scientific evidence which supports the conclusion that homosexuality is a normal expression of human sexuality that is not chosen  that gay and lesbian people form stable  committed relationships that are equivalent to heterosexual relationships in essential respects  and that same sex couples are no less fit than heterosexual parents to raise children and their children are no less psychologically healthy and well adjusted than children of opposite sex parents  The body of research strongly supports the conclusion that discrimination by the federal government between married same sex couples and married opposite sex couples in awarding benefits unfairly stigmatizes same sex couples  The research also contravenes the stereotype based rationales that were advanced to support passage of DOMA and that the Equal Protection Clause was designed to prohibit  73  Opposition See also  Opponents of same sex marriage in the United States Rally for Prop 8 in Fresno  California  October 2008  Opponents of same sex marriage in the United States ground their arguments on parenting concerns  religious concerns  and concerns that changes to the definition of marriage would lead to the inclusion of polygamy or incest  The Southern Baptist Convention says that extending marriage rights to same sex couples would undercut the conventional purpose of marriage  74 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints  the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops  the Southern Baptist Convention  and National Organization for Marriage argue that children do best when raised by a mother and father  and that legalizing same sex marriage is  therefore  contrary to the best interests of children  75  76  77  78   Maggie Gallagher of the National Organization for Marriage has raised concerns about the impact of same sex marriage upon religious liberty and upon faith based charities in the United States  79  Other arguments against same sex marriage are based upon concerns that the process of redefining the institution would be a Pandora s box  Stanley Kurtz of the Weekly Standard has written that same sex marriage would eventually lead to the legalization of polygamy and polyamory  or group marriage  in the United States  80  The most successful tactic to prevent gay marriage has been to implement constitutional referendums against same sex marriages  Another has been to reverse or revoke gay marriage after it was granted as in California  Proposition 8   The funding of such election campaigns has been an issue of great dispute  Both judges 81  82  and the IRS 83  have ruled that it is either questionable or illegal for campaign contributions to be shielded by anonymity  In February 2012  the National Organization for Marriage vowed to spend  250 000 in Washington legislative races to defeat the Republican state senators who voted for same sex marriage  84  Public opinion Main article  Public opinion of same sex marriage in the United States Public support for same sex marriage has grown since the 1990s  In 1996  just 25  of Americans supported legalization  Today  public opinion polls show that Americans are either equally split on the issue or a slim majority are in support  Polling trends in 2010 and 2011 show support for same sex marriage gaining a majority  although the difference is within the error limit of the analysis  85  On May 20  2011  Gallup reported majority support for gay marriage by a margin that exceeded the poll s margin of error  11  In June 2011  two prominent polling organizations released an analysis of the changing trend in public opinion about same sex marriage in the United States  concluding that  public support for the freedom to marry has increased  at an accelerating rate  with most polls showing that a majority of Americans now support full marriage rights for all Americans   86  Effects of same sex marriage Economic impact on same sex couples Dr  M  V  Lee Badgett  an economist and associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst  has studied the impact of same sex legal marriage on same sex couples  According to a 1997 General Accounting Office study requested by Rep  Henry Hyde  R   at least 1 049 U S  federal laws and regulations include reference to marital status  87  A later 2004 study by the Congressional Budget Office finds 1 138 statutory provisions  in which marital status is a factor in determining or receiving  benefits  rights  and privileges    88  Many of these laws govern property rights  benefits  and taxation  Same sex couples  whose marriages are not recognized by the state  are ineligible for spousal and survivor Social Security benefits  88  Badgett s research finds the resulting difference in Social Security income for same sex couples compared to opposite sex married couples is US 5 588 per year  The federal ban on same sex marriage and benefits through the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act  DOMA  extends to federal government employee benefits  88  According to Badgett s work  same sex couples face the following other financial challenges against which legal marriage at least partially shields opposite sex couples  89  Potential loss of couple s home from medical expenses of one partner caring for another gravely ill one 89  Costs of supporting two households  travel  or emigration out of the U S  for an American citizen unable to legally marry a non U S  citizen 89  Higher cost of purchasing private insurance for partner and children if company is not one of 18  that offer domestic partner benefits 89  Higher taxes  unlike a company s contribution to an employee s spouse s health insurance  domestic partner benefits are taxed as additional compensation 88  Legal costs associated with obtaining domestic partner documents to gain some of the power of attorney  health care decision making  and inheritance rights granted through legal marriage 89  Higher health costs associated with lack of insurance and preventative care  20  of same sex couples have a member who is uninsured compared to 10  of married opposite sex couples 89  Current tax law allows a spouse to inherit an unlimited amount from the deceased without incurring an estate tax but an unmarried partner would have to pay the estate tax on the inheritance from her his partner 88  Same sex couples are not eligible to file jointly or separately as a married couple and thus cannot take the advantages of lower tax rates when the individual income of the partners differs significantly 88  While state laws grant full marriage rights  Connecticut  Iowa  Massachusetts  New Hampshire  New York and Vermont  or some or all of the benefits under another name  New Jersey  Washington  California  etc    these state laws do not extend the benefits of marriage on the Federal level  and most states do not currently recognize same sex marriages  domestic partnerships  or civil unions from other states  Potential economic disadvantages While the legal benefits of marriage are numerous  same sex couples could face the same financial constraints of legal marriage as opposite sex married couples  Such potential effects include the marriage penalty in taxation  if the federal government were to recognize same sex marriage   88  Similarly  while social service providers usually do not count one partner s assets toward the income means test for welfare and disability assistance for the other partner  a legally married couple s joint assets are normally used in calculating whether a married individual qualifies for assistance  88  Economic impact on the federal government The 2004 Congressional Budget Office study  working from an assumption  that about 0 6 percent of adults would enter into same sex marriages if they had the opportunity   an assumption in which they admitted  significant uncertainty   estimated that legalizing same sex marriage throughout the United States  would improve the budget s bottom line to a small extent  by less than  1 billion in each of the next 10 years   This result reflects an increase in net government revenues  increased income taxes due to marriage penalties more than offsetting decreased tax revenues arising from postponed estate taxes   Marriage recognition would increase the government expenses for Social Security and Federal Employee Health Benefits but that increase would be more than made up for by decreased expenses for Medicaid  Medicare  and Supplemental Security Income  88  Mental health Based in part on empirical research that has been conducted on the adverse effects of stigmatization  numerous prominent social science organizations have issued position statements supporting same sex marriage and opposing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation  these organizations include the American Psychoanalytic Association and the American Psychological Association  73  Several psychological studies 90  91  92  have shown that an increase in exposure to negative conversations and media messages about same sex marriage creates a harmful environment for the LGBT population that may affect their health and well being  One study surveyed more than 1 500 lesbian  gay and bisexual adults across the nation and found that respondents from the 25 states that have outlawed same sex marriage had the highest reports of  minority stress    the chronic social stress that results from minority group stigmatization   as well as general psychological distress  According to the study  the negative campaigning that comes with a ban is directly responsible for the increased stress  Past research has shown that minority stress is linked to health risks such as risky sexual behavior and substance abuse  93  Two other studies examined personal reports from LGBT adults and their families living in Memphis  Tennessee  immediately after a successful 2006 ballot campaign banned same sex marriage  Most respondents reported feeling alienated from their communities  afraid that they would lose custody of their children and that they might become victims of violence  The studies also found that families experienced a kind of secondary minority stress  says Jennifer Arm  a counseling graduate student at the University of Memphis  94  Dr  Ilan H  Meyer  Williams Senior Scholar of Public Policy at the UCLA School of Law and expert on minority stress  has found through several empirical studies that gays and lesbians encounter a disproportionate level of stress and mental health difficulties because of discrimination and oppressive laws  and that these stresses amplify the social stigma that makes them more susceptible to depression  suicide and substance abuse  95  In his testimony during the Perry v  Schwarzenegger trial  he stated that the mental health outcomes for gays and lesbians would improve if laws such as Proposition 8 did not exist because  when people are exposed to more stress   they are more likely to get sick     and that particular situation is consistent with laws that say to gay people  you are not welcome here  your relationships are not valued   Such laws   have  significant power   he says  95  96  Physical health In 2009  a pair of economists at Emory University tied the passage of state bans on same sex marriage in the US to an increase in the rates of HIV infection  97  98  The study linked the passage of same sex marriage ban in a state to an increase in the annual HIV rate within that state of roughly 4 cases per 100 000 population  A study by the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health found that gay men in Massachusetts visited health clinics significantly less often following the legalization of same sex marriage in that state  99  Timeline of major events 1970 1999 October 10  1972  The United States Supreme Court dismisses appeal in Baker v  Nelson  for want of a substantial federal question   100  May 5  1993  The Supreme Court of Hawaii rules that statute limiting marriage to opposite sex couples is presumed to be unconstitutional unless the state can show that it is  1  justified by compelling state interests and  2  narrowly drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgements of rights under the Hawaii Constitution  The case is sent back to the lower courts for a trial on these two issues  101  September 21  1996  President Bill Clinton signs into law the Defense of Marriage Act  denying
