gov Kansas  i  k nz s   is a U S  state located in the Midwestern United States  5  It is named after the Kansas River which flows through it  which in turn was named after the Kansa Native American tribe  which inhabited the area  6  The tribe s name  natively kk  ze  is often said to mean  people of the wind  or  people of the south wind   although this was probably not the term s original meaning  7  8  Residents of Kansas are called  Kansans   For thousands of years what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes  Tribes in the Eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys  Tribes in the Western part of the state were semi nomadic and hunted large herds of bison  Kansas was first settled by European Americans in the 1830s  but the pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s  in the midst of political wars over the slavery issue  When officially opened to settlement by the U S  government in 1854  abolitionist Free Staters from New England and pro slavery settlers from neighboring Missouri rushed to the territory to determine if Kansas would become a free state or a slave state  Thus  the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided  and was known as Bleeding Kansas  The abolitionists eventually prevailed and on January 29  1861  9  10  Kansas entered the Union as a free state  After the Civil War  the population of Kansas grew rapidly  when waves of immigrants turned the prairie into farmland  Today  Kansas is one of the most productive agricultural states  producing high yields of wheat  sorghum and sunflowers  11  Kansas is the 15th most extensive and the 33rd most populous of the 50 United States  Contents 1 History 2 Geography 2 1 Geology 2 2

of Kansas and Kansas in the American Civil War For millennia  the land that is currently Kansas was inhabited by Native Americans  The first European to set foot in present day Kansas was Francisco V squez de Coronado  who explored the area in 1541  In 1803  most of modern Kansas was secured by the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase  Southwest Kansas  however  was still a part of Spain  Mexico  and the Republic of Texas until the conclusion of the Mexican American War in 1848  From 1812 to 1821  Kansas was part of the Missouri Territory  The Santa Fe Trail traversed Kansas from 1821 to 1880  transporting manufactured goods from Missouri and silver and furs from Santa Fe  New Mexico  Wagon ruts from the trail are still visible in the prairie today  In 1827  Fort Leavenworth became the first permanent settlement of white Americans in the future state  The Kansas Nebraska Act became law on May 30  1854  establishing the U S  territories of Nebraska and Kansas  and opening the area to broader settlement by whites  Kansas Territory stretched all the way to the Continental Divide and included the sites of present day Denver  Colorado Springs  and Pueblo  Quantrill s Raid on Lawrence  Kansas Missouri and Arkansas sent settlers into Kansas all along its eastern border  These settlers attempted to sway votes in favor of slavery  The secondary settlement of Americans in Kansas Territory were abolitionists from Massachusetts and other Free Staters  who attempted to stop the spread of slavery from neighboring Missouri  Directly presaging the American Civil War  these forces collided  entering into skirmishes that earned the territory the name of Bleeding Kansas  Kansas was admitted to the United States as a slave free state on January 29  1861  making it the 34th state to enter the Union  By that time the violence in Kansas had largely subsided  But  during the Civil War  on August 21  1863  William Quantrill led several hundred men on a raid into Lawrence  destroying much of the city and killing nearly 200 people  He was roundly condemned by both the conventional Confederate military and the partisan rangers commissioned by the Missouri legislature  His application to that body for a commission was flatly rejected due to his pre war criminal record  12  After the Civil War  many veterans constructed homesteads in Kansas  Many African Americans also looked to Kansas as the land of  John Brown  and  led by freedmen like Benjamin  Pap  Singleton  began establishing black colonies in the state  Leaving southern states in the late 1870s because of increasing discrimination  they became known as Exodusters  At the same time  the Chisholm Trail was opened and the Wild West era commenced in Kansas  Wild Bill Hickok was a deputy marshal at Fort Riley and a marshal at Hays and Abilene  Dodge City was another wild cowboy town  and both Bat Masterson and Wyatt Earp worked as lawmen in the town  In one year alone  8 million head of cattle from Texas boarded trains in Dodge City bound for the East  earning Dodge the nickname  Queen of the Cowtowns   In part as a response to the violence perpetrated by cowboys  on February 19  1881 Kansas became the first U S  state to adopt a Constitutional amendment prohibiting all alcoholic beverages   edit  Geography Kansas is bordered by Nebraska on the north  Missouri on the east  Oklahoma on the south  and Colorado on the west  The state is divided into 105 counties with 628 cities  and is located equidistant from the Pacific and Atlantic oceans  The geographic center of the 48 contiguous states is located in Smith County near Lebanon  The geodetic center of North America was located in Meades Ranch  Kansas  Osborne County until 1983  This spot was used until that date as the central reference point for all maps of North America produced by the U S  government  The geographic center of Kansas is located in Barton County   edit  Geology Main article  Geology of Kansas Kansas is underlain by a sequence of horizontal to gently westward dipping sedimentary rocks  A sequence of Mississippian  Pennsylvanian and Permian rocks underlie the eastern and southern part of the state  The western half of the state consists of Cretaceous through Tertiary sediments derived from the erosion of the uplifted Rocky Mountains to the west  The northeastern corner of the state was subjected to glaciation in the Pleistocene and is covered by glacial drift and loess   edit  Topography The western two thirds of the state  lying in the great central plain of the United States  has a generally flat or undulating surface  while the eastern third has many hills and forests  The land gradually rises from east to west  its altitude ranges from 684 ft  208 m  along the Verdigris River at Coffeyville in Montgomery County  to 4 039 ft  1 231 m  at Mount Sunflower  one half mile from the Colorado border  in Wallace County  It is a popular belief that Kansas is the flattest state in the nation  reinforced by a well known 2003 study 13  stating that Kansas was indeed  flatter than a pancake   14  This has since been called into question  with most scientists ranking Kansas somewhere between 20th and 30th flattest state  depending on measurement method  Its average elevation is 2 000 feet  higher than 36 states  15   edit  Rivers Spring River  Kansas The Missouri River forms nearly 75 mi  121 km  of the state s northeastern boundary  The Kansas River  locally known as the Kaw   formed by the junction of the Smoky Hill and Republican rivers at appropriately named Junction City  joins the Missouri at Kansas City  after a course of 170 mi  270 km  across the northeastern part of the state  The Arkansas River  pronunciation varies   rising in Colorado  flows with a bending course for nearly 500 mi  800 km  across the western and southern parts of the state  It forms  with its tributaries  the Little Arkansas  Ninnescah  Walnut  Cow Creek  Cimarron  Verdigris  and the Neosho   the southern drainage system of the state  Other important rivers are the Saline and Solomon Rivers  tributaries of the Smoky Hill River  the Big Blue  Delaware  and Wakarusa  which flow into the Kansas River  and the Marais des Cygnes  a tributary of the Missouri River  Spring River is located between Riverton  Fuglies   Kansas and Baxter Springs

three climatic types  according to the K ppen climate classification  it has humid continental  semi arid steppe  and humid subtropical  The eastern two thirds of the state  especially the northeastern portion  has a humid continental climate  with cool to cold winters and hot  often humid summers  Most of the precipitation falls in the summer and spring  The western third of the state   from about the U S  Route 183 corridor westward   has a semiarid steppe climate  Summers are hot  often very hot  and generally less humid  Winters are highly changeable between warm and very cold  The western region receives an average of about 16 inches  410 mm  of precipitation per year  Chinook winds in the winter can warm western Kansas all the way into the 80  F  27  C  range  The far south central and southeastern reaches of the state have a humid subtropical climate with hot  humid summers  milder winters and more precipitation than the rest of the state  Although not strictly falling in all of the zones  some features of all three climates can be found in most of the state  with droughts and changeable weather between dry and humid not uncommon  and both warm and cold spells in the winter  Precipitation ranges from about 47 inches  1200 mm  annually in the southeast of the state  to about 16 inches  400 mm  in the southwest  Snowfall ranges from around 5 inches  130 mm  in the fringes of the south  to 35 inches  900 mm  in the far northwest  Frost free days range from more than 200 days in the south  to 130 days in the northwest  Thus  Kansas is the 9th or 10th sunniest state in the country  depending on the source  Western Kansas is as sunny as California and Arizona  Kansas is prone to severe weather  especially in the spring and early summer  In spite of the frequent sunshine throughout much of the state  due to its location at a climatic boundary prone to multiple air masses the state is vulnerable to strong and severe thunderstorms   Many of these storms become Supercell thunderstorms  These can spawn tornadoes  often of EF3 strength or higher  According to statistics from the National Climatic Data Center  Kansas has reported more tornadoes  for the period January 1  1950 through October 31  2006  than any state except for Texas   marginally even more than Oklahoma  It has also   along with Alabama   reported more F5 or EF5 tornadoes than any other state  These are the most powerful of all tornadoes  Kansas averages over 50 tornadoes annually  17  Severe thunderstorms sometimes drop very large Hail over Kansas as well as bringing flash flooding and damaging straight line winds  According to NOAA  the all time highest temperature recorded in Kansas is 121  F  49 4  C  on July 24  1936  near Alton  and the all time low is  40  F   40  C  on February 13  1905  near Lebanon  Kansas s record high of 121  F  49 4  C  ties with North Dakota for the fifth highest record high in an American state  behind California  134  F

Rural flight Main article  Rural flight Kansas is one of the slowest growing states in the nation  Known as a rural flight  the last few decades have been marked by a migratory pattern out of the countryside into cities  Out of all the cities in these Midwestern states  89  have fewer than 3 000 people  and hundreds of those have fewer than 1 000  In Kansas alone  there are more than 6 000 ghost towns and dwindling communities  26  according to one Kansas historian  Daniel C  Fitzgerald  At the same time  some of the communities in Johnson County  metropolitan Kansas City  are among the fastest growing in the country   edit  Economy The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that the total GDP in 2008 was  122 7 billion  making it the United States s 32nd highest state by GDP  27  Per

decline as it becomes increasingly difficult to extract oil over time  Since oil prices bottomed in 1999  oil production in Kansas has remained fairly constant  with an average monthly rate of about 2 8 million barrels  450 000 m3  in 2004  The recent higher prices have made carbon dioxide sequestration and other oil recovery techniques more economical  Kansas ranks 8th in U S  natural gas production  Production has steadily declined since the mid 1990s with the gradual depletion of the Hugoton Natural Gas Field the state s largest field which extends into Oklahoma and Texas  In 2004  slower declines in the Hugoton gas fields and increased coalbed methane production contributed to a smaller overall decline  Average monthly production was over 32 billion cubic feet  0 9 km    The Kansas economy is also heavily influenced by the aerospace industry  Several large aircraft corporations have manufacturing facilities in Wichita and Kansas City  including Spirit AeroSystems  Boeing

Kansas have an additional local sales tax  Except during the 2001 recession  March November 2001  when monthly sales tax collections were flat  collections have trended higher as the economy has grown and two rate increases have been enacted  Total sales tax collections for 2003 amounted to  1 63 billion  compared to  805 3 million in 1990  Revenue shortfalls resulting from lower than expected tax collections and slower growth in personal income following a 1998 permanent tax reduction has contributed to the substantial growth in the state s debt level as bonded debt increased from  1 16 billion in 1998 to  3 83 billion in 2006  Some increase in debt was expected as the state continues with its 10 year Comprehensive Transportation Program enacted in 1999  As of June 2004  Moody s Investors Service ranked the state 14th for net tax supported debt per capita  As a percentage of personal income  it was at 3 8  above the median value of 2 5  for all rated states and having risen from a value of less than 1  in 1992  The state has a statutory requirement to maintain cash reserves of at least 7 5  of expenses at the end of each fiscal year  however  lawmakers can vote to

Fort Scott  Frontenac  Pittsburg  and Baxter Springs before entering Oklahoma  Map of the Kansas road system  Kansas also has the second largest state highway system in the country after California  This is because of the high number of counties and county seats  105  and the intertwining of them all  In January 2004  the Kansas Department of Transportation  KDOT  announced the new Kansas 511 traveler information service  30  By dialing 511  callers will get access to information about road conditions  construction  closures  detours and weather conditions for the state highway system

city  Manhattan Regional Airport in Manhattan offers daily flights to Dallas Fort Worth International Airport and Chicago s O Hare International Airport  making it the second largest commercial airport in the state  31  Most air travelers in northeastern Kansas fly out of Kansas City International Airport  located in Platte County  Missouri  For those in the far western part of the state  Denver International Airport is a popular option  Connecting flights are also available from smaller Kansas airports in Dodge City  Garden City  Great Bend  Hays  Hutchinson  and Salina  Forbes Field

the state over Kansas governor Alfred M  Landon during the landslide of 1936  The state backed Republicans Wendell Willkie and Thomas E  Dewey in 1940 and 1944  respectively  Kansas also supported Dewey in 1948 despite the presence of incumbent president Harry S  Truman  who hailed from Independence  Missouri  approximately 15 miles east of the Kansas Missouri state line  Since FDR carried Kansas in 1932 and 1936  only one Democrat has won Kansas  electoral votes  Lyndon B  Johnson in 1964  Over the past four decades  Kansas has remained more socially conservative than many parts of the

the state teaching standards  a decision that was later reversed  32  In 2005  voters accepted a constitutional amendment to ban same sex marriage  The next year  the state passed a law setting a minimum age for marriage at 15 years  33  In 2008  Governor Sebelius vetoed permits for the construction of new coal fired energy plants in Kansas  saying   We know that greenhouse gases contribute to climate change  As an agricultural state  Kansas is particularly vulnerable  Therefore  reducing pollutants benefits our state not only in the short term   but also for generations of Kansans to come   34  However  shortly after Mark Parkinson became governor in 2009 upon Sebelius s resignation  Parkinson announced a compromise plan to allow construction of a coal fired plant  In 2010  Sam

Increase in the percentage of high school graduates who are college or career ready  Decrease in the percentage of Kansas  children who live in poverty  For the 2012 legislative session  Brownback has identified five major objectives  Major reform of the taxation system as a way to reduce Kansas  unemployment  Reduction in the ever increasing amounts paid for Medicaid  Revision of the school finance formula  which has become outdated and ineffective  Structural government reform to reduce the cost of government to keep the budget in balance  Elimination of over  8 billion in unfunded liabilities of the state employee pension program  KPERS   which is one of the most financial unstable in the nation  Brownback had established himself as a very conservative member of the U S  Senate in years prior  but since becoming governor has made several controversial decisions  In May 2011  much to the opposition of art leaders and enthusiasts in the state  Brownback eliminated the Kansas Arts Commission  making Kansas the first state without an arts agency  35  In July 2011  Brownback announced plans to close the Lawrence branch of the Kansas Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services as a cost saving measure  Hundreds rallied against the decision  36  Lawrence City Commission later voted to provide the funding needed to keep the branch open  37   edit  Federal politics

third full term in 2010  but he was elected Governor in that year s general election  Moran defeated Tiahrt for the Republican nomination for Brownback s seat in the August 2010 primary  then won a landslide general election victory over Democrat Lisa Johnston  The only non Republican presidential candidates Kansas has given its electoral vote to are Populist James Weaver and Democrats Woodrow Wilson  Franklin Roosevelt  twice   and Lyndon Johnson  In 2004  George W  Bush won the state s six electoral votes by an overwhelming margin of 25 percentage points with 62  of the vote  The only two counties to support Democrat John Kerry in that election were Wyandotte  which contains Kansas City  and Douglas  home to the University of Kansas  located in Lawrence  The 2008 election brought similar results as John McCain won the state with 57  of the votes  Douglas  Wyandotte  and Crawford County were the only counties in support of President Barack Obama  38  In 1996  when Kansas Republican Senator Bob Dole failed in his bid to become President on the party s national ticket  the state became the second in the nation  following Minnesota and preceding Arizona by identical twelve year intervals  to produce two losing major party presidential candidates  and the first in which the said candidates ran on the GOP ticket  following Alfred Landon s loss to FDR in 1936
