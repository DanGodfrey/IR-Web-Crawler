Homelessness in the United States From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search Homeless American Homelessness in the United States has continued to remain a focus area of concern of social service providers  government officials  and policy professionals since its resurgence among many types of individuals and families  1  The number of homeless people further grew in the 1980s  as housing and social service cuts increased and the economy deteriorated  The United States government determined that somewhere between 200 000 and 500 000 Americans were then homeless  2  Over the past decade or so  the availability and quality of data on homelessness has improved considerably  due in part to initiatives by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD   the US Department of Health and Human Services  the US Department of Veterans Affairs  and several nongovernmental organizations working with homeless populations  Since 2007  the US Department of Housing and Urban Development has issued an Annual Homeless Assessment Report  which reports to Congress the number of individuals and families who are homeless in the previous year  both sheltered and unsheltered  in order to standardize data and collection processes for government officials and service providers  3  According to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development  there were 643 067 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons nationwide as of January 2009  Additionally  about 1 56 million people used an emergency shelter or a transitional housing program during the 12 month period between October 1  2008 and September 30  2009  This number suggests that roughly 1 in every 200 persons in the US used the shelter system at some point in that period  4  According to the United States Conference of Mayors  5  the main cause is the lack of affordable housing  The three next primary causes are  mental illness or the lack of needed services substance abuse and lack of needed services low paying jobs The minor causes cited by the mayors were  Prisoner release Unemployment Domestic violence Poverty Contents 1 Overview 1 1 Definition 1 2 Causes 2 Statistics and

originally developed as part of the McKinney Vento Act of 1987 federal legislation  6  describes a  homeless  person as being  An individual who lacks a fixed  regular  and adequate nighttime residence  An individual who has a primary nighttime residence that is   A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary living accommodations  including welfare hotels  congregate shelters  and transitional housing for the mentally ill   An institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to be institutionalized  or A public or private place not designed for  or ordinarily used as  a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings   edit  Causes The major causes of homelessness include  5  7  8  9  The deinstitutionalization movement from the 1950s onwards in state mental health systems  to shift towards  community based  treatment of the mentally ill  as opposed to long term commitment in institutions  Redevelopment and gentrification activities instituted by cities across the country through which low income neighborhoods are declared blighted and demolished to make way for projects that generate higher property taxes and other revenue  creating a shortage of housing affordable to low income working families  the elderly poor  and the disabled  citation needed  The failure of urban housing projects to provide safe  secure  and affordable housing to the poor  The economic crises and  stagflation  of the 1970s  citation needed  which caused high unemployment  citation needed  Unlike European countries  US unemployment insurance does not allow unemployed insurance recipients to obtain job training education while receiving benefits except under very limited situations  citation needed  The failure of the U S  Department of Veterans Affairs to provide effective mental health care citation needed  and meaningful job training for many homeless veterans  citation needed  particularly those of the Vietnam War  Deprived of normal childhoods  nearly half of foster children in the United States become homeless when they are released from foster care at age 18  10  11  citation needed  Natural disasters that destroy homes  hurricanes  floods  earthquakes  etc  Places of employment are often destroyed too  causing unemployment and transience  citation needed  People who have served time in prison  have abused drugs and alcohol  or have a history of mental illness find it difficult to impossible to find employment for years at a time because of the use of computer background checks by potential employers  12  According to the Institution of Housing in 2005  the U S  Government has focused 42  more on foreign countries rather than homeless Americans  including homeless veterans  People who are hiding in order to evade law enforcement  Teenagers who flee or are thrown out by parents who disapprove of their child s sexual orientation  A 2010 study by the Center for American Progress shows that a disproportionately high number of homeless youth  between 20 40   identify as LGBTQ  13  According to the U S  Conference of Mayors  the demand for emergency shelter in 270 U S  cities increased 13  in 2001 and 25  in 2005  5  7  22 percent of those requesting emergency shelter were turned away  Traditionally single men have constituted the majority of the homeless  In the 1980s there was a sharp rise in the number of homeless families in certain parts of the United States  notably New York City  citation needed  Most homeless families consist of a single mother and children  A significant number of homeless people are teenagers and young adults  mostly runaways or street children  A 1960 survey by Temple University of Philadelphia s poor neighborhoods found that 75  of the homeless were over 45 years old  and 87  were white  14  In 1986  86  were under age 45  and 87  were minorities  According to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development s 2008 Annual Homeless Assessment Report  the most common demographic features of all sheltered homeless people are  male  members of minority groups  older than age 31  and alone  More than two fifths of sheltered homeless people have a disability  At the same time  sizable segments of the sheltered homeless population are white  non Hispanic  38 percent   children  20 percent   or part of multi person households  33 percent   Approximately 68 percent of the 1 6 million sheltered homeless people were homeless as individuals and 32 percent were persons in families  15  In 2008 more than two thirds of all sheltered homeless people were located in principal cities  with 32 percent located in suburban or rural jurisdictions  About two fifths of people entering an emergency shelter or transitional housing program during 2008 came from another homeless situation  sheltered or unsheltered   two fifths came from a housed situation  in their own or someone else s home   and the remaining one fifth were split between institutional settings or other situations such as hotels or motels  Most people had relatively short lengths of stay in emergency shelters  three fifths stayed less than a month  and a third stayed a week or less  15   edit  Statistics and demographics Completely accurate and comprehensive statistics are difficult to acquire for any social study  but especially so when measuring the ambiguous hidden  and erratic reality of homelessness  All figures given are estimates  In addition  these estimates represent overall national averages  the proportions of specific homeless communities can vary substantially depending on local geography  16   edit  2009 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress Perhaps the most accurate  comprehensive  and current data on homelessness in the United States is reported annually by the Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  in the Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress  AHAR   released in June of every year since 2007  The AHAR report relies on data from two sources  single night  point in time counts of both sheltered and unsheltered homeless populations reported on the Continuum of Care applications to HUD  and counts of the sheltered homeless population over a full year provided by a sample of communities based on data in their local Homeless Management Information Systems  HMIS   15   edit  International context The United States has estimated 750 000 homeless in a population of approximately 300 million  or 2 5 homeless per 1000 people  Canada has much higher rate with estimated 200 000 400 000 homeless in a population of approximately 35 million  or around 5 10 homeless per 1000 people  17  Australia has estimated 105 000 homeless each night 18  in a population of approximately 20 million  or around 5 homeless per 1000 people   edit  Other statistics Some estimates from various sources on the characteristics and number of homeless people  Total

or affordable housing as responsible for the delay  10  are so called  chronic  and remain without housing for extended periods of time on a frequent basis  They typically struggle with mental illness  substance abuse  or both   edit  Historical background  edit  Pre 1960s Many towns and cities had an area which contained the poor  transients  and afflicted  such as a  skid row   In New York City  for example  there was an area known as  the Bowery   traditionally  where alcoholics were to be found sleeping on the streets  bottle in hand  Rescue missions offering  soup  soap  and salvation   a phrase introduced by The Salvation Army  24  sprang up along the Bowery thoroughfare  including the oldest one  The Bowery Mission  The mission was founded in 1879 by the Rev  and Mrs  A G  Ruliffson  25  The Bowery Mission at 36 Bowery in New York City in the 1880s The mission s parent organization  Christian Herald  once published Christian Herald And Signs Of Our Times  In relating the formation and origin of the mission in its March 27  1895 edition a chronology is given   Fifteen years ago  Rev  A G  Ruliffson and Mrs  Ruliffson  long engaged in mission work in New York  decided to open an eastside mission for men   Thus  based on this chronology  the time frame is 1880 rather than 1879  At the time the Bowery Mission was established it was located at 36 Bowery  a location that in an earlier time in New York City  played a role in the New York City Draft Riots  when the building was used as a saloon  An examination of the Annual Reports for the first decade of the mission  and period New York City newspapers starting in 1881  suggest that an 1880 date for the mission is more likely than 1879  To cite examples from period newspapers  The New York Tribune s article   The Bowery Mission  A Sketch of its Career   dated March 14  1898 opens with  The Bowery Mission was started in 1880 at No 36 Bowery by a number of men who were interested in mission work   An even earlier article appearing in The New York Tribune on November 8  1880   A Bright Spot In The Darkness   declared  The Bowery Evangelical Mission  at No 36 Bowery  was opened yesterday afternoon with a prayer meeting  at which some 150 persons were present   The present location of the Bowery Mission at 227 229 Bowery dates to 1909 when an abandoned coffin factory was converted to a mission  In smaller towns  there were hobos  who temporarily lived near train tracks and hopped onto trains to various destinations  Especially following the American Civil War  a large number of homeless men formed part of a counterculture known as  hobohemia  all over America  This phenomenon re surged in the 1930s during and after the Great Depression  26  27  Jacob Riis wrote about  documented  and photographed the poor and destitute  although not specifically the homeless  in New York City tenements in the late 19th century  His ground breaking book  How the Other Half Lives  published in 1890  raised public awareness of living conditions in the slums  causing some changes in building codes and some social conditions   edit  1960s  1970s In the United States  during the late 1970s  the deinstitutionalization of patients from state psychiatric hospitals was a precipitating factor which seeded the homeless population  especially in urban areas such as New York City  28  The Community Mental Health Act of 1963 was a pre disposing factor in setting the stage for homelessness in the United States  29  Long term psychiatric patients were released from state hospitals into Single Room Occupancies and sent to community health centers for treatment and follow up  It never quite worked out properly and this population largely was found living in the streets soon thereafter with no sustainable support system  30  31  In 1965  The Diggers  a community action group dedicated to the concept of everything being free of charge  established soup kitchens and free health care facilities in the Haight Ashbury district of San Francisco  32  This also began a movement of people that began to travel for political reasons as well as for personal choices  This is where the beginnings of the American nomadic caravans became popular  living homelessly  but happily  In 1969 the Pine Street Inn was founded by Paul Sullivan on Pine Street in Boston s Chinatown district and began caring for homeless destitute alcoholics  In 1980  it moved to larger facilities on Harrison Avenue in Boston due to growing needs of the homeless population  33  34  In 1974  Kip Tiernan founded Rosie s Place in Boston  the first drop in and emergency shelter for women in the United States  in response to the increasing numbers of needy women throughout the country  In 1979  a New York City lawyer  Robert Hayes  brought a class action suit before the courts  Callahan v  Carey  against the City and State  arguing for a person s state constitutional  right to shelter   It was settled as a consent decree in August 1981  The City and State agreed to provide board and shelter to all homeless men who met the need standard for welfare or who were homeless by certain other standards  By 1983 this right was extended to homeless women   edit  1980s The History of the United States  1980 1991  illustrates that this was a time when there was economic distress  high unemployment  and was the period when chronic homelessness became a modern problem on a larger scale  In 1980 federal funds accounted for 22  of big city budgets  but by 1989 the same such aid composed only 6  of urban revenue  part of a larger 60  decrease in federal spending to support local governments   35  It is largely  although not exclusively  in these urban areas that homelessness became widespread and reached unprecedented numbers  Most notable were cuts to federal low income housing programs  An advocacy group claims that Congress halved the budget for public housing and Section 8  the government s housing voucher subsidization program  and that between the years of 1980 and 1989 HUD s budget authority was reduced from  74 billion to  19 billion  35  Such alleged changes is claimed to have resulted in an inadequate supply of affordable housing to meet the growing demand of low income populations  In 1970 there were 300 000 more low cost rental units  6 5 million  than low income renter households  6 2 million   By 1985 the advocacy group claimed that the number of low cost units had fallen to 5 6 million  and the number of low income renter households had grown to 8 9 million  a disparity of 3 3 million units 36  The 1980s also saw a continuing trend of deinstitutionalizing mental health hospitals  It is believed who   that a large percentage of these released patients ended up in the homeless system  Many existing shelters and soup kitchens had to expand their facilities to accommodate the larger number of homeless  For example  in 1980  the Pine Street Inn had to move to larger facilities on Harrison Avenue in Boston 33  34  and in 1984  Saint Francis House had to move its operation from the St  Anthony Shrine on Arch Street to an entire ten floor building on Boylston Street  37  In response to the ensuing homelessness crisis of the 1980s  concerned citizens across the country who   demanded that the federal government provide assistance  After many years of advocacy and numerous revisions  President Reagan signed into law the McKinney Vento Homeless Assistance Act in 1987 this remains the only piece of federal legislation that allocates funding to the direct service of homeless people  By the mid 1980s  there was also a dramatic increase in family homelessness  Tied into this was an increasing number of impoverished and runaway children  teenagers  and young adults  which created a new sub stratum of the homeless population   edit  1990s The  McKinney Vento Act  paved the way for service providers in the coming years  During the 1990s homeless shelters  soup kitchens  and other supportive services sprouted up in cities and towns across the nation  However  despite these efforts and the dramatic economic growth marked by this decade  homeless numbers remained stubbornly high  It became increasingly apparent that simply providing services to alleviate the symptoms of homelessness  i e  shelter beds  hot meals  psychiatric counseling  etc    although needed  were not successful at solving the root causes of homelessness   edit  2000s Throughout this decade  homeless service providers and the Federal government have been able to reduce chronic homelessness and homelessness among Veterans with targeted efforts and interagency cooperation on initiatives like the HUD VASH program  38  The 2000s  however  saw a new population of those experiencing homelessness  families with children  While an emerging problem at the beginning of the decade  39  the problem continued to persist through 2010  At the close of the decade the trend continued unabated  with the number of individuals in homeless families increasing from 431 541 in 2007 to 535 447 in 2009  38  Another emerging concern at the onset of this decade was the disproportionate representation of the LGBTQ community among the population of unaccompanied youth experiencing homelessness  In 2002  activist and youth advocate Carl Siciliano founded the Ali Forney Center a homeless shelter in New York City that is dedicated specifically to providing aid and shelter to homeless and at risk LGBTQ youth  The center takes its name from a homosexual teenager who lived on the streets for much of the 1990s  While homeless  Ali Forney protected other LGBTQ homeless youth by performing HIV prevention and awareness work  He also urged the NYPD to investigate the murders of several homosexual homeless youth whom he had befriended during his time on the street  In 1997  Ali Forney was himself murdered by an as of yet unidentified attacker  However  Ali s outreach and advocacy work inspired Carl Siciliano to found an organization dedicated to improving the lives of LGBTQ homeless youth in New York  The Ali Forney Center provides both emergency and transitional housing for homosexual homeless youth  whose numbers account for anywhere between 20 40  of the 2 1 million homeless youth in America  The percentage of LGBTQ homeless youth is much higher than that of the general population  which runs between 5 10   13  The work of the Ali Forney Center is one example of the ways that the social service community has responded to the needs of growing sub populations of those experiencing homelessness  In 2001  the NAEH along with the U S  ICH encouraged communities to create and implement state and local strategic plans to prevent and end homelessness  focusing on Housing First initiatives to house the chronically homeless population who have many barriers to stability  a cost benefit analysis of state  and local level resources  best practice engagement and service innovations  and prevention  40  Many communities and states across the country have created these plans and have set up measurable goals and targets for the short  and long term  41  In February 2009  President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009  which was part of the President s effort to save or create 3 5 million jobs in the United States to mitigate the effects of the economic recession begun in 2008  Part of the Act addressed homelessness prevention  in which he allocated an additional  1 5 billion to HUD for the  Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Rehousing Program  HPRP    The purpose of HPRP was to assist individuals and families who are otherwise healthy and not chronically homeless in escaping homelessness or preventing homelessness of the vulnerable population  HPRP grant monies were distributed to localities in the same formula used for Emergency Shelter Grants  ESG  in amounts not to exceed  500 000 and must be used within three years  Primary grantee activities include short term and medium term rental assistance and housing relocation and stabilization services  including mediation  credit counseling  security or utility deposits  utility payments  moving cost assistance  and case management  42  43  On May 20  2009  President Obama signed the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing  HEARTH  Act into Public Law  Public Law 111 22 or  PL 111 22    reauthorizing HUD s Homeless Assistance programs  It was part of the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009  The HEARTH act allows for the prevention of homelessness  rapid re housing  consolidation of housing programs  and new homeless categories  In the eighteen months after the bill s signing  HUD had to begin implementing the new McKinney compliant programs  44  45  In late 2009  some homeless advocacy organizations  such as the National Coalition for the Homeless  reported and published perceived problems with the HEARTH Act of 2009 as a HUD McKinney Vento Reauthorization bill  especially with regard to privacy  definitional ineligibility  community roles  and restrictions on eligibile activities  46  However  at the close of 2010 HUD reported that many communities had successfully used HPRP funds to assist those in need in their communities  and reported that the program prevented homelessness for nearly 750 000 Americans  47  The Federal government contains one agency that focuses on the issue of homelessness in America  and it has had a much greater role in the policy community since its revitalization at the beginning of the decade and its continued appropriations in the HEARTH Act  The United States Interagency Council on Homelessness  USICH  a federal agency contained in the Executive Branch  was established in 1987 as a requirement of the McKinney Vento Act of 1987  Since its revitalization in 2001 as an agency independent from the Executive Office of the President and reauthorization in 2009  USICH serves as the coordinating body of all 19 federal agencies and their programs and initiatives to serve the homeless population  48  Its mission is to   coordinate the Federal response to homelessness and to create a national partnership at every lever of government and with the private sector to reduce and end homelessness in the nation while maximizing the effectiveness of the Federal Government in contributing to the end of homelessness   49  USICH has taken on a much greater role in Federal level initiatives to end homelessness in the United States since exiting the Executive Office of the President and notably since the enactment of the HEARTH Act  in which it was mandated that USICH provide leadership in developing a national strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness  50  Since its authorization as an independent agency  USICH been able to work with stakeholders across all government sectors and at all levels to promote collaboration and best practices within the homeless service provider community   edit  2010s Homeless man soliciting employment  Ypsilanti  Michigan The first year of the new decade saw a renewed commitment from the Federal government in its efforts to prevent and end homelessness with the creation and release of Opening Doors  The Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness  51 Opening Doors is a publication of the U S  Interagency Council on Homelessness  which worked with all Federal agencies and many state and local stakeholders on its creation and vision  setting a ten year path for the nation on preventing and ending all types of homelessness  This Plan was presented to the President and Congress in a White House Ceremony on June 22  2010  52  The Vision of the Plan is   No one should experience homelessness   no one should be without a safe  stable place to call home   This document focuses on four main goals  Finish the job of ending chronic homelessness in the next five years  2015  Prevent and end homelessness among Veterans in five years  2015  Prevent and end homelessness for families  children and youth in ten years  2020  Set a path to ending all types of homelessness The most recent Point In Time Count by HUD took place the second two weeks of January 2011  53  and data reported at that time and gathered from Continuum of Care providers in local communities will be used to compile the 2010 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report to be released in the middle of 2011   edit  Causes  In 2004 the United States Conference of Mayors    surveyed the mayors of major cities on the extent and causes of urban homelessness and most of the mayors named the lack of affordable housing as a cause of homelessness     The next three causes identified by mayors  in rank order  were mental illness or the lack of needed services  substance abuse and lack of needed services  and low paying jobs  The lowest ranking cause  cited by five mayors  was prisoner reentry  Other causes cited were unemployment  domestic violence  and poverty   54  Housing opportunities Many workers cannot afford to live where they work  and even in moderately priced communities housing costs require a large portion of household income  55   edit  Personal factors Street sleeper in New York City  2006  Untreated mental illness  and disability can cause individuals to become paranoid  anxious  or depressed  making it difficult or impossible to maintain employment  pay bills  or keep supportive social relationships  Substance abuse can drain financial resources  cause job or housing loss  and erode supportive social relationships  Substance abuse is quite prevalent in the homeless population  56  Many people  especially women and often with children  who flee from domestic violence often must quickly adapt to massive life changes  Many find it extremely difficult to secure a new place of residence and or a job  Institutional release  Most individuals being discharged from prison have few resources to  get back on their feet  and have eroded personal contacts that may provide support  Youths who  age out  of systems such as foster care often find themselves without needed support networks  Lastly  it should be mentioned that some people find themselves homeless due to unexpected extenuating circumstances  Natural disasters  Many people lose their homes to any variety of natural catastrophes including but not limited to  floods  forest fires  storms  and earthquakes  In 2005 hurricanes Katrina and Rita displaced over 1 million Americans  Tornadoes destroyed entire towns in Tennessee in 2006  Unexpected emergencies  A variety of people find themselves unable to cope with any number of the following sudden tragedies  being laid off from a long term place of employment  losing their place of residence to an accidental fire  serious bodily injuries  discovery of terminal illnesses or diseases  loss of family member s   These situations usually result not only in significant monetary expenses  but also in severe psychological and emotional hardships  More affordable housing Homeless individuals report a lack of affordable housing as the number one reason for becoming homeless  57  This inadequacy must be remedied in order to get people off the streets and out of shelters  Many non profit organizations are in operation to serve this need for example  the National Low Income Housing Coalition but most lack the funding necessary to create enough housing  Several proposed policy measures are designed to secure such funding  such as the National Housing Trust Fund  but these have not been signed into law  Comprehensive health care Homeless individuals report mental illness as being the number three reason for becoming or staying homeless  57  Such illnesses are often closely linked with the fourth reason substance abuse and therefore it is generally accepted that both of these issues should be treated simultaneously  Although many medical  psychiatric  and counseling services exist to address these needs  it is commonly believed that without the support of reliable and stable housing such treatments remain ineffective  Furthermore  in the absence of a universal health care plan  many of those in need cannot afford such services  Legislation such as the Bringing America Home Act  if enacted  would provide comprehensive and available treatment for all  Paradigm shift A significant paradigm has occurred in homeless services over the past five years which has begun to shift the emphasis from  managing the problem of homelessness  with emergency shelters  soup kitchens and health clinic to ending homelessness by housing individuals who are experiencing homelessness  In 2000  the National Alliance to End Homelessness  13  released  A Plan  Not a Dream  How to End Homelessness in Ten Years  which encouraged communities to develop and implement 10 year plans to end homelessness in their communities  Key effective programs include  Shelter Plus Care   a federal program that provides housing subsidies and are matched by local funds to provide long term supportive services  typically case management   Experience demonstrated that many individuals who have been homeless for a significant time often lose their housing shortly after placement  The Shelter Plus Care program provides long term supports including working with the landlord to keep the individual housed  Housing First   a service paradigm that assumes that individuals who are homeless are  ready  to be housed immediately and with appropriate supports can retain their housing  The Pathways to Housing project in New York demonstrated a five year housing retention rate of 88 percent among formerly homeless individuals with serious mental illness  Homeless people seeking help are often required to participate in substance abuse  mental health  and life skills programs of a year or more regardless of whether those are factors in their case  Many people only need decent housing to get back on their feet  Central City Concern s  Portland  Oregon  Shoreline Project allows homeless unemployed men to move into SRO type single person studios and find a job within 70 days  it s been a great success with expected expansion of the program in 2007  Assertive Outreach   a form of engagement and outreach that emphasizes building a bond of trust between the case worker and the individual  Engagement is highly individualized with the pace dictated by the individual in need  Case workers do not force rules  regulations or program services until they are requested  Typically used to engage homeless  mentally ill individuals  In Boston  Massachusetts  in September 2007  an outreach to the homeless was initiated in the Boston Common  after some arrests and shootings  and in anticipation of the cold winter ahead  This outreach targets homeless people who would normally spend their sleeping time on the Boston Common  and tries to get them into housing  trying to skip the step of an emergency shelter  Applications for Boston Housing Authority were being handed out and filled out and submitted  This is an attempt to enact by outreach the Housing First initiative  federally mandated  Boston s Mayor  Thomas Menino  was quoted as saying  The solution to homelessness is permanent housing   Still  this is a very controversial strategy  especially if the people are not able to sustain a house with proper community  health  substance counseling  and mental health supportive programs  58   edit  Effects on education homeless students Homelessness has a tremendous effect on a child s education  Education of homeless youth is thought to be essential in breaking the cycle of poverty   The McKinney Vento Homeless Assistance Act mandates equal opportunity to a free public education to homeless students  This act is supposed to break down the barriers homeless students have to receiving an education  These barriers include residency restriction  medical record verification  and transportation issues  Once a student surpasses these barriers  they are still subject to the stigma of being homeless  and the humiliation they feel because of their situation  Some families do not report their homelessness  while others are unaware of the opportunities available to them  Many report that maintaining a stable school environment helps the students because it s the only thing that remains normal  59  Many homeless students fall behind their peers in school due to behavioral disorders  and lack of attendance in school  60  Since the housing market fall out there has been a rise in the number of homeless students  NAEHCY or the National Association for the Education of Homeless for Children and Youth  has reported a 99  increase in homeless students within a three month period  San Diego   61  Of 1 636 schools  330 reported no increase  847 reported an increase of half  and 459 reported an increase of 25  or more  Due to the provisions of the McKinney Vento Act many school districts are struggling to provide the necessary services  such as rising transportation needs and the greater severity of services  One of the biggest challenges our district faces is providing transportation to students who are experiencing homelessness  There are few approaches that our district can utilize to provide transportation for these students  Our city has only one taxi cab service and no public bus system  Our cab company is small and simply cannot fulfill all of our transportation requests  When it s possible  we add students to existing bus routes or set up a contractual agreement with the student s parent guardian  However  there have been many situations where none of these options have worked  Another challenge our district faces is providing proper outer wear for students who are homeless  Being that we live in central Wisconsin and have long  cold winters  all students need proper outerwear to go outside  Proper outerwear includes snow boots  hat  mittens  snow pants  and a winter jacket that has a working zipper or buttons on it  This expense adds up quickly and is hard to provide to the increasing number of homeless students  61  This is especially worrisome since homeless students are 1  1 5 times more likely to perform below grade level in reading  2 1 5 times more likely to perform below grade level in spelling  and 3  2 5 times more likely to perform below grade level in math  61  There are a few worries that there will be false reports of homeless students  but mostly it s not an issue  59   edit  Public attitudes Many advocates for the homeless contend that a key difficulty is the social stigma surrounding homelessness  There is anecdotal evidence that many Americans complain about the presence of homeless people  blame them for their situation  and feel that their requests for money or support  usually via begging  are unjustified  In the 1990s  particularly  many observers and media articles spoke of  compassion fatigue  a belief that the public had grown weary of this seemingly intractable problem  Public opinion surveys show relatively little support for this view  however  A 1995 paper in the American Journal of Community Psychology concluded that  although the homeless are clearly stigmatized  there is little evidence to suggest that the public has lost compassion and is unwilling to support policies to help homeless people   62  A Penn State study in 2004 concluded that  familiarity breeds sympathy  and greater support for addressing the problem  63  A 2007 survey of New Yorkers found 67 percent said most homeless people were without shelter because of  circumstances beyond their control   More than one third  36 percent  said they worried about becoming homeless themselves  with 15 percent saying they were  very worried   The survey by the nonpartisan group Public Agenda found support for investments in prevention  rental assistance and permanent housing  64  Public Agenda has also concluded  however  that the public s sympathy has limits  In a 2002 national survey  the organization found 74 percent say the police should leave a homeless person alone if he or she is not bothering anyone  Yet 71 percent say the police should move the homeless if they are keeping customers away from a shopping area and 51 percent say the homeless should be moved if they are driving other people away from a public park  65   edit  Homeless assistance programs The homeless community of the United States is aided in many ways from governmental and non governmental oraganizations  Non governmental organizations help the homeless by advocating or by physical and financial aid  Organizations like the  National Alliance to End homelessness  go to government officials and offices to speak on behalf of the homeless community calling for policy changes or for the creation of policy to help end homelessness  Government agencies respond  The following programs and policies attack the phenomenon of homelessness  provide help to the homeless  and prevent further growth of the homeless population   edit  Programs Many programs that are designed to assist the homeless population have incorporated some type of housing program for their clients  Whether it is a transitional  permanent or even emergency housing program  the assistance is often provided for a very low cost and maybe even free  In the United States each year  there are around 3 5 million people who live their lives without shelter or a stable occupation  For 2006 alone   28 5 billion was allotted to homeless programs ran through HUD  Housing and Urban Development    1 billion was given for Section 8 housing  and  1 4 billion was used for Homeless Assistance Grants  As one example  Volunteers of America is an agency that believes preventing family homelessness is a critical part of their organization  Through them  transitional housing and emergency shelters are available to those who are in desperate need   edit  Housing The two main types of housing programs provided for homeless people are  Transitional Transitional housing programs are operated with one goal in mind   to help individuals and families obtain permanent housing as quickly as possible  Transitional housing programs assist homeless for a fixed amount of time or until they are able to obtain housing on their own and function successfully in the community  or whichever comes first  66  67  68  Permanent For a significant number of homeless Americans with mental or physical impairments  often coupled with drug and or alcohol use issues  long term homelessness can only be ended by providing permanent housing coupled with intensive supportive services  Permanent housing provides a  base  for people to move out of poverty  Some shelters and associated charitable foundations have bought buildings and real estate to develop into permanent housing for the homeless in lieu of transitional Housing  69  The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and Veterans Administration have a special Section 8 housing voucher program called VASH  Veterans Administration Supported Housing   or HUD VASH  which gives out a certain number of Section 8 subsidized housing vouchers to eligible homeless and otherwise vulnerable US armed forces veterans  70  Substance abuse prevention Without supportive services  housing is not often enough to end homelessness  Various agencies  in fact all homeless prevention agencies and programs include substance abuse recovery and prevention programs  Objectives are to provide substance abuse counseling and access to treatment centers  Self sufficiency For a significant number of homeless Americans with mental or physical impairments  often coupled with drug and or alcohol use issues  long term homelessness can only be ended by providing permanent housing coupled with intensive supportive services   edit  Policies There are several policies dealing with homelessness  In 1980 the government decided to start sending funding to the homeless  but it was not until 1984 that shelters were built to accommodate and feed them  As it was shown though seventy percent required the homeless to attend a religious ceremony and spend only a couple of nights there  In the 1987 McKinney Act the problem with homelessness became known as a huge social problem  Later on  the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001  P L  107 110  amended the program explicitly to prohibit states that receive McKinney Vento funds from segregating homeless students from non homeless students  except for short periods of time for health and safety emergencies or to provide temporary  special  supplementary services  The Chronic Homelessness Initiative  The Bush Administration established a national goal of ending chronic homelessness in ten years  by 2012  The idea of a 10 year plan to end chronic homelessness began as a part of a 10 year plan to end homelessness in general adopted by the National Alliance to End Homelessness  NAEH  in 2000  The following year  then Secretary Martinez announced HUD s commitment to ending chronic homelessness at the NAEH annual conference  In 2002  as a part of his FY2003 budget  President Bush made  ending chronic homelessness in the next decade a top objective   The bi partisan  congressionally mandated  Millennial Housing Commission  in its Report to Congress in 2002  included ending chronic homelessness in 10 years among its principal recommendations  By 2003  the Interagency Council on Homelessness had been re engaged and charged with pursuing the President s 10 year plan  The Administration has recently undertaken some collaborative efforts to reach its goal of ending chronic homelessness in 10 years  On October 1  2003  the Administration announced the award of over  48 million in grants aimed at serving the needs of the chronically homeless through two initiatives  The  Ending Chronic Homelessness through Employment and Housing   14  initiative was a collaborative grant offered jointly by HUD  15  and the Department of Labor  DOL   16   The initiative offered  10 million from HUD and  3 5 million from DOL to help the chronically homeless in five communities gain access to employment and permanent housing  Section 8 is the core housing program that helps extremely low income families accommodate the gap between their incomes below 30 percent of the median income for each community  The government assists homeless families by awarding grants and vouchers  Vouchers are available to the families who are most needy and they are used to pay for housing found in the private market  Currently there are policy changes in who receives vouchers and there will be a reduction in the amount of vouchers granted to the homeless population  On May 20  2009  President Barack Obama signed the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing  HEARTH  Act of 2009  The HEARTH Act amends and reauthorizes the McKinney Vento Homeless Assistance Act with substantial changes  The HEARTH Act of 2009 consolidated HUD s competitive grant programs  created a Rural Housing Stability Program  changed HUD s definition of homelessness and chronic homelessness  supplied a simplified match requirement  increased prevention resources and increased in the emphasis on performance The primary purpose of the legislation was to provide principle definitions regarding homelessness  The following terms   homeless    homeless individual    homeless person   and  homeless individual with a disability    edit  Housing First Housing First is a relatively recent innovation that has met with success in providing housing to homeless people with substance abuse problems or mental health issues  Housing First allows homeless men and women to be taken directly off the street into private community based apartments  without requiring treatment first  This allows the homeless to return to some sense of normalcy  from which it is believed that they are better poised to tackle their addictions or sicknesses  The relapse rate through these types of programs is lower than that of conventional homeless programs  It was initiated by the federal government s Interagency Council on Homelessness  It asks cities to come up with a plan to end chronic homelessness  In this direction  there is the belief that if homeless people are given independent housing to start off with  with some proper social supports  then there would be no need for emergency homeless shelters  which it considers a good outcome  This is a very controversial position  71  72  There are many complications of this kind of program and these must be dealt with to make such an initiative work successfully in the middle to long term  73  74   edit  Criminalization of homelessness  Practices that criminalize homelessness do nothing to address the underlying causes of homelessness  Instead  they exacerbate the problem   75   edit  Vagrancy Measures passed  prohibit activities such as sleeping camping  eating  sitting  and begging in public spaces  usually including criminal penalties for violation of these laws   75  Violators of such laws typically incur criminal penalties  which result in fines and or incarceration  In April 2006 the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that  making it a crime to be homeless by charging them with a crime is in violation of the 8th and 14th Amendments   76  77  However  on October 15  2007  the Court vacated its Opinion when  on appeal the parties settled the case out of court  78  The City could not expressly criminalize the status of homelessness by making it a crime to be homeless without violating the Eighth Amendment  nor can it criminalize acts that are an integral aspect of that status  Because there is substantial and undisputed evidence that the number of homeless persons in Los Angeles far exceeds the number of available shelter beds at all times  including on the nights of their arrest or citation  Los Angeles has encroached upon Appellants  Eighth Amendment protections by criminalizing the unavoidable act of sitting  lying or sleeping at night while being involuntarily homeless    the Eighth Amendment prohibits the City from punishing involuntary sitting  lying  or sleeping on public sidewalks that is an unavoidable consequence of being human and homeless without shelter in the City of Los Angeles    By our decision  we in no way dictate to the City that it must provide sufficient shelter for the homeless  or allow anyone who wishes to sit  lie  or sleep on the streets of Los Angeles at any time and at any place within the City  All we hold is that  so long as there is a greater number of homeless individuals in Los Angeles than the number of available beds  the City may not enforce section 41 18 d  at all times and places throughout the City against homeless individuals for involuntarily sitting  lying  and sleeping in public  In August 2007  in Boston  Massachusetts  the city took action to keep loiterers  including the homeless  off the Boston Common overnight  after a series of violent crimes and drug arrests  79   edit  Sex offender registration Sex offender registration has been noted for its effect on homeless sex offenders  Georgia s sex offender registration law  which declared that the homeless could not register and was punishable by life imprisonment  was invalidated by the Georgia Supreme Court in October 2008 for not giving homeless fair notice of how they could comply with the statute s registration requirement   edit  Crimes against homeless people Recent years have seen a growing number of violent acts committed upon people experiencing homelessness the rate of such documented crimes in 2005 was 30  higher than of those in 1999  75  75  of all perpetrators are under the age of 25  In recent years  largely due to the efforts of the National Coalition for the Homeless  NCH  and academic researchers  the problem of violence against the homeless has gained national attention  In their report  Hate  Violence  and Death on Mainstreet USA  the NCH reported 386 violent acts committed against homeless persons over the period  among which 155 were lethal  The NCH called those acts hate crimes  they retain the definition of the American Congress   They insist that so called bumfight videos disseminate hate against the homeless and dehumanize them  The Center for the Study of Hate  amp  Extremism  CSHE  at California State University  San Bernardino in conjunction with the NCH found that 155 homeless people were killed by non homeless people in  hate killings   while 76 people were killed in all the other traditional hate crime homicide categories such as race and religion  combined  80  The CSHE contends that negative and degrading portrayals of the homeless contribute to a climate where violence takes place  Various studies and surveys indicate that homeless people have a much higher criminal victimization rate than the non homeless  but that most incidents never get reported to authorities  On October 1  2006 CBS News 60 Minutes telecast a story on  thrill  violence against the homeless and  Bumfights  videos  A 2007 study found that the number of violent crimes against the homeless is increasing  80  81   edit  Situations in specific U S  cities  edit  Los Angeles The Los Angeles region is thought to have the largest concentration of homeless persons in the country and is considered the homelessness capital of the USA 82  83   together with San Francisco  In its biennual census of 2011  the County counted more than 51 000 homeless persons living in the county at any given night  84  One hundred thousands persons are expected to be homeless at least one night during the year  85  A 50 block area in downtown Los Angeles called Skid Row  4 316  86  has a homeless population nearly as large as the homeless population of San Francisco  6 455   87 Hollywood and the city of Santa Monica also suffer from visible homelessness  Los Angeles  of course  has approximately 3 6 times the population of San Francisco  88  this means that even in proportions Los Angeles has more homeless than San Francisco  In 2009  the author Geoffrey Neil wrote a novel  Dire Means  whose underlying premise was about the homeless situation in Santa Monica  California  89   edit  San Francisco The city of San Francisco  California  due to its mild climate and its social programs that have provided cash payments for homeless individuals  is often considered the homelessness capital of the United States 90   together with Los Angeles  The city s homeless population has been estimated at 7 000 10 000 people  of which approximately 3 000 5 000 refuse shelter  The city spends  200 million a year on homelessness related programs  91  On May 3  2004  17   San Francisco officially began an attempt to scale back the scope of its homelessness problem by changing its strategy from cash payments to the  Care Not Cash  plan  At the same time  grassroots organizations within the Bay Area such as the Suitcase Clinic work to provide referrals for housing and employment to the homeless population  In 2010  a city ordinance was passed which will disallow sitting and lying down on public sidewalks for most of the day  from 7am until 11pm  92   edit  Chicago The city of Chicago  Illinois is also noted for its number of homeless people  Over the years  Chicago has gained a reputation as the city with the most homeless people  rivaling Los Angeles and New York  although no statistical data has backed this up  The reputation stems primarily from the subjective number of beggars found on the streets rather than any sort of objective statistical census data  Indeed  from statistical data  Chicago has far less homeless per capita than peers New York  and Los Angeles  or other major cities such as Philadelphia  San Francisco  and Boston  among others  with only 5 922 homeless recorded in a one night count taken in 2007  93   edit  Denver  Colorado In Denver  Colorado  Mayor John Hickenlooper has made dealing with the issues that underlie homelessness a top priority on his Mayoral agenda  speaking heavily on the issue during his first  State of the City  address in 2003  While Denver s homeless population is much lower than other major cities  the homeless residents have often suffered when without shelter during Denver s infamously cold winters  Now officials have said that this number has risen over the past few years  18   edit  Indianapolis  Indiana In  19  Indianapolis  Indiana  as many as 2 200 people are homeless on any given night  and as many as 15 000 individuals over the course of a year  Indianapolis is notable among cities of similar size for having only faith based shelters  such as the century old  20  Wheeler Mission  In 2001  Mayor Bart Peterson endorsed a 10 year plan  called the  21  Blueprint to End Homelessness  and made it one of his administration s top priorities  The plan s main goals are for more affordable housing units  employment opportunities  and support services  The Blueprint notwithstanding  Indianapolis has criminalized aspects of homelessness  such as making panhandling a misdemeanor  and the  22  City County Council has twice  in April 2002  and August 2005  denied the zoning necessary to open a new shelter for homeless women   edit  Boston  amp  Massachusetts In December 2007  Mayor Thomas M  Menino of Boston  announced that the one night homeless count had revealed that the actual number of homeless living in the streets was down  94  A nightly inhabitant of an MBTA bus shelter at Porter Square in Cambridge  Massachusetts  2010  In October 2008  Connie Paige of The Boston Globe reported that the number of homeless in Massachusetts had reached an all time high  mostly due to mortgage foreclosures and the national economic crisis  95  In October 2009  as part of the city s Leading the Way initiative  Mayor Thomas Menino of Boston dedicated and opened the Weintraub Day Center which is the first city operated day center for chronically homeless persons  It is a multi service center  providing shelter  counseling  health care  housing assistance  and other support services  It is a 3 400 square foot  320 m2  facility located in the Woods Mullen Shelter  It is also meant to reduce the strain on the city s hospital emergency rooms by providing services and identifying health problems before they escalate into emergencies  It was funded by  3 million in grants from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009  Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development  DHCD   the Massachusetts Medical Society and Alliance Charitable Foundation  96  and the United States Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  SAMHSA   97  In 2010  there was a continued crackdown on panhandling  especially the aggressive type  in downtown Boston  Summonses were being handed out  with scheduled court appearances  The results were mixed and in one upscale neighborhood  Beacon Hill  the resolve of the Beacon Hill Civic Association  which has received only one complaint about panhandlers  was to try to solve the bigger problem not by criminal actions  98  Due to economic constraints in 2010  Governor Deval Patrick had to cut the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 2011 budget so dental care for the majority of adults  including most homeless people  covered by MassHealth  Medicaid  would no longer be provided except for cleaning and extractions  with no fillings  dentures  or restorative care  99  100  This does not affect dental care for children  The measure took effect in July 2010 and affects an estimated 700 000 adults  including 130 000 seniors  101  In September 2010  it was reported that the Housing First Initiative had significantly reduced the chronic homeless single person population in Boston  Massachusetts  although homeless families were still increasing in number  Some shelters were reducing the number of beds due to lowered numbers of homeless  and some emergency shelter facilities were closing  especially the emergency Boston Night Center  102  There is sometimes corruption and theft by the employees of a shelter as evidenced by a 2011 investigative report by FOX 25 TV in Boston wherein a number of Boston public shelter employees were found stealing large amounts of food over a period of time from the shelter s kitchen for their private use and catering  103  104   edit  New York City On June 22  2010  the New York City Department of Homeless Services reported that the sheltered homeless population consisted of  105  8 243 Families with children 1 271 Adult Families 7 725 Single Adults 35 537 Total Individuals According to the Coalition for the Homeless  the homeless population of New York rose to an all time high in 2011  A reported 113 552 people slept in the city s emergency shelters last year  including over 40 000 children  marking an 8 percent increase from the previous year and a 37 percent increase from 2002  There was also a rise in the number of families relying on shelters  approximately 29 000  That is an increase of 80  from 2002  About half of the people who slept in shelter in 2010 returned for housing in 2011  23  87  According to the NYC Department of Homeless Services  64 percent of those applying for emergency shelter in 2010 were denied  Several were denied because they were said to have family who could house them when in actuality this might not have been the case  Applicants may have faced overcrowding  unsafe conditions  or may have had relatives unwilling to house them  According to Mary Brosnaham  spokeswoman for Coalition for the Homeless  the administration of Mayor Michael Bloomberg employs a deliberate policy of  active deterrence   Part of the problem lies with long term joblessness that characterizes the United States  economic crisis  According to the Center for an Urban Future about a third of the adult workers in New York City are low wage earners  making under  11 54 an hour  Affordable rent rates considered to be no more than a third of the renter s wages  A family in New York City must earn at least over  54 000 to find an affordable home  The median household income for renters in the Bronx and Brooklyn is barely  30 000 and 35 000 respectively  According to the Community Service Society   Two thirds of poor New Yorkers and over one third of near poor households up to twice the poverty level spend at least half of their incomes on rent and place millions of low income New Yorkers at risk of housing hardships and displacement   The New York City Housing Authority is experiencing record demand for subsidized housing assistance  However  just 13 000 of the 29 000 families who applied were admitted into the public housing system or received federal housing vouchers known as  Section 8  in 2010  Due to budget cuts there have been no new applicants accepted to receive Section 8  24  In March 2010  there were protests about the Governor s proposed cut of  65 million in annual funding to the homeless adult services system  106  The Bloomberg administration announced an immediate halt to the Advantage program  threatening to cast 15 000 families back into the shelters or onto the streets  A court has delayed the cut until May 2011 because there was doubt over the legality of cancelling the city s commitment  However  the Advantage program  25  itself was consciously advanced by the Bloomberg administration as an alternative to providing long term affordable housing opportunities for the poor and working class  The result  as the  Coalition for the Homeless  report points out  is that  Thousands of formerly homeless children and families have been forced back into homelessness  In addition  Mayor Bloomberg proposed  37 million in cuts to the city s budget for homeless services this year  26   edit  Florida Homeless advocate and urban designer Michael E  Arth proposed building a Pedestrian village for the adult homeless in Volusia County near Daytona Beach  Florida in 2007  107  108  109  As of 2009  Arth was still working toward trying to consolidate most of the scattered 19 local agencies into an attractive community that would be designed to more effectively address the needs of the chronically adult homeless and the temporarily adult homeless  as well as others who may be having difficulty fitting into the pervasive  automobile dominated culture  He writes that the current  piecemeal approach  inefficiently spreads out services and work opportunities  and aggravates the problem by polarizing citizens who might otherwise be inclined to help  In response to critics who say that such a village would be like a concentration camp  Arth points out that the U S  already concentrates their citizens into prisons at 7 8 times the rate of Canada or Europe   There should be alternative between living on the street and being locked up that addresses the needs of the chronically and temporarily adult homeless   His proposed  Tiger Bay Village  would have a community garden and orchard  a place to hire certified workers  and a work crew to help build and maintain the village   Little shops in the village center could process and rehabilitate donated clothes and furnishings to be sold to the public   Housing would range from multi bed barracks to small Katrina cottages depending on a person s contributions to the village  special needs  and income  Arth claims that this would cost less and be far more effective than any of the other solutions tried elsewhere  110   edit  Income sources Many are employed intermittently  Begging and panhandling is another important income source for some  but not most  homeless people  111   edit  Internet begging Cyberbegging or Internet begging is reported to be a new and effective way to beg without feeling shame  112   edit  Health concerns There has been concern about the transmission of diseases in the homeless population housed in shelters  and the people who work there  especially with tuberculosis  113  A 2011 study led by Dr  Rebecca T  Brown in Boston  Massachusetts conducted by the Institute for Aging Research  an affiliate of Harvard Medical School   Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center  and the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program found the elderly homeless population had  higher rates of geriatric syndromes  including functional decline  falls  frailty and depression  than seniors in the general population and that many of these conditions may be easily treated if detected   The report was published in the Journal of Geriatric Internal Medicine  114   edit  Women Main article  Homeless women in the United States A woman sleeping in Rockefeller Center s subway station  In the last decades of the 20th century  the number of women in the homeless population had increased dramatically and grown faster than the number of men  115  In the early 21st century  the numbers of homeless women continued to grow  116  In 2008 in one sample  women represented 26  of the respondents surveyed  compared to 24  in 2007  117  Homeless women between the ages of 18 and 44 are between 5 and 31 times more at risk of dying than those women who have homes  Homeless women over the age of 44  however  are healthier than homeless men of the same age  and are negligibly more at risk of dying than housed women  118  119  Psychologically  however  homeless women in their fifties suffer from troubles and chronic diseases from which their housed counterparts only begin to suffer in their seventies  Despite their comparable psychological condition  elderly housing assistance is not available to these homeless women  116  Between 3 1 and 4 4   of homeless women in the United States are veterans of the armed services  57  of these have availed of the Veterans Affairs  healthcare services  120  Adult partner abuse  foster care  and childhood sexual abuse are all more likely to have been experienced by homeless women than by their male counterparts  121  Domestic violence is the direct cause of homelessness for over half of all homeless women in the United States  122  Approximately three quarters of the women who attempt to avail of domestic violence shelter beds are turned away in major American cities  123  These victims of domestic violence are often excluded from homelessness studies  despite the lack of livable conditions in their homes  124  125  126  127  It Was a Wonderful Life  a 1993 documentary film narrated by Jodie Foster  chronicles the lives of

on dated information  For all of the reasons discussed above  none of these estimates is the definitive representation of  how many people are homeless   In a recent approximation USA Today estimated 1 6 million people unduplicated persons used transitional housing or emergency shelters  Of these people  approximately 1 3 are members of households with children  a nine percent increase since 2007  Another approximation is from a study done by the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty which states that approximately 3 5 million people  1 35 million of them children  are likely to experience homelessness in a given year  National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty  2007    Retrieved 02AUG2011    a b c d National Coalition for the Homeless Who is homeless   Published by the
