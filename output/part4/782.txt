Kirby  the character first appeared in Fantastic Four  1 in November 1961  and was the first female superhero created by Marvel in the Silver Age of Comics  Like the other founding members of the

Franklin and Valeria Richards   and her close friend Ben Grimm  An object of infatuation for Doctor Doom and  most notably  Namor the Sub Mariner  Sue s passive invisibility power translated into her frequent deployment as a damsel in distress during the team s early adventures  However  upon developing the ability to project powerful fields of energy  Sue Storm became a more powerful member of the Fantastic Four  and the team s second in command  While Sue operated somewhat in the shadow of her hot headed brother  Johnny Storm  and her brilliant husband Reed Richards in the early years  she

requires expansion  Stan Lee s original 2 page plot summary for the first issue of The Fantastic Four  reprinted in the Marvel Masterworks edition of the first ten issues  handled Susan s powers similarly to the Universal Pictures s  Invisible  series  which required her to take off her clothes  but noting concern that that might be  too sexy  for a comic book  Sue was initially presented as the sole reason for Ben Grimm  a bad guy  remaining on the group  which was significantly toned down in the published series  citation needed  Invisible Woman has primarily appeared in issues of Fantastic Four  Susan s initial power of invisibility proved to be of minor consequence in the team s early missions  especially compared to the abilities of the others in the group  Eventually  the creators expanded Sue s abilities  giving her the power to render other objects and people invisible and create strong force fields and psionic blasts  Despite her enhanced abilities  Susan served primarily as an assistant and second in command to Reed in the early years of the series  This changed when John Byrne began his run on the title  Under his authorship  Sue became more confident and assertive in her abilities which became more versatile and impressive  For instance  she found she could use her force field abilities to manipulate matter through the air  immobilize enemies  or administer long range attacks  Susan changed her nom de guerre to Invisible Woman  and is now recognized as one of the more powerful characters in the Marvel Universe   edit  Fictional character biography As detailed in The Marvel Saga  Official History of The Marvel Universe  16  Susan Storm  and her younger brother  Jonathan grew up in the town of Glenville  Long Island  children of a physician named Franklin Storm and a woman named Mary  The parents left their kids alone one night to travel to a dinner honoring Dr  Storm  On the way  a tire blew out but only Mary was injured  Franklin escaped injury and insisted on operating on his wife  He was unable to save her and she died  After his wife s death  Dr  Franklin Storm became a gambler and a drunk  losing his medical practice  which led him to the accidental killing of a loan shark  Franklin did not defend himself in court  because he still felt guilty over Mary s death  With their father in prison  Susan had to become a mother figure for her younger brother  While living with her aunt  Susan  at the young age of 17  met her future husband  Reed Richards  a house guest who was attending college  When she graduated high school as the award winning captain of her Girls  Varsity Swim Team  she moved to California to attend college  where she pursued an acting career and encountered Richards again  They began to become romantically involved with each other  Reed Richards  working in the field of Aerospace engineering  was designing a spacecraft for interstellar travel  Everything was going well until the government stopped the funding of his project  Richards  wanting to see his project through  decided to make an unscheduled test flight  Originally  it was only going to be Reed and his best friend  Ben Grimm  involved  but Susan was instrumental in persuading Reed in letting her brother and herself join them on the dangerous space mission  In space  the quartet was exposed to massive amounts of cosmic radiation  As a result  they had to abort the mission and return to Earth  After the crash landing  they realized that they gained superhuman powers  hers was the ability to become invisible at will  Realizing the potential use of their abilities  the four of them became the Fantastic Four  for the benefit of mankind  1  Susan adopted the code name  Invisible Girl   1   edit  Invisible Girl One of the Sub Mariner s many attempts to win Sue s affections  Art by Jack Kirby  As the Fantastic Four  the team found themselves setting up their first headquarters in the Baxter Building in Manhattan  The first supervillain they battled was the Mole Man  2  followed soon after that by the Skrulls  2  The Fantastic Four encountered many villains in the early part of their career  but none of them contended for Susan s affections more than Namor the Sub Mariner  Sue felt an amount of attraction to Namor  but her heart belonged with Reed  3  Soon after that  the Fantastic Four encountered Doctor Doom for the first time  4  Initially  her powers were limited to making herself invisible  However  before long Sue discovered she could make other things invisible as well as create force fields of invisible energy  5  After Susan is injured in battle with the Mole Man  her father escaped from prison and operated on her to save her life  Franklin made amends with his children before returning to prison  however  the Super Skrull found a way to kidnap Dr  Storm  mimic his appearance  and then fight the Fantastic Four as the Invincible Man  In the process of defeating the Super Skrull  Dr  Storm sacrificed his own life to protect the Fantastic Four from a Skrull booby trap  Reed and Sue s relationship progressed  with the two of them deciding to get married  The wedding was the event of the century  with several of New York City s preeminent superheroes in attendance  Even several supervillains wanted to attend  if only for the chance to attack the Fantastic Four  6  Not long after that  Susan and the Fantastic Four encountered Galactus and the Silver Surfer for the first time  7  Sue later became pregnant with her first child  8  As a result  she took time off as an active member of the team  Johnny s then girlfriend  the Inhuman elementalist known simply as Crystal  joined the team  taking over Susan s roster spot  9  10  Susan s cosmic ray irradiated blood cells served as an obstacle for her in carrying the unborn child to term  Knowing this  Reed  Johnny  and Ben journeyed into the Negative Zone to acquire the Cosmic Control Rod from Annihilus  Effectively utilizing the device  the baby was safely delivered and was named Franklin  in memory of Susan s father  11  Due to the genetically altered structure of his parents  Franklin was born a mutant  possessing vast powers of the highest possible potential  Seeking to use the boy s talents for his own sadistic purposes  Annihilus returned and successfully triggered a premature full release of Franklin s latent abilities  which were already in the process of gradual emergence  Fearing that his son could very well release enough psionic energy to eliminate all life on Earth  Reed was forced to shut Franklin s mind down  feeling there was no immediate alternative  Angry with Reed for not seeking her input in the matter  Susan left the Fantastic Four and had a marital separation from Reed  12  Taking her roster spot was Medusa  of the Inhumans  With the help of Namor  Susan reconciled with Reed and returned to the Fantastic Four accompanied by Franklin  13   edit  Invisible Woman Sue possessed by Malice  Art by John Byrne  Susan eventually became pregnant for a second time  However  the trauma of her first pregnancy paled in comparison to that of her second for several reasons  This second child was stillborn due to Susan having been exposed to radiation inside the Negative Zone on a previous trip  14  A depressed Susan was later manipulated by events set into motion by Psycho Man into becoming Malice  As Malice  Susan attacked her friends and family in the Fantastic Four  utilizing her abilities at power levels she had never displayed previously  She effortlessly defeated She Hulk and Human Torch  luckily  Reed was able to save Susan by forcing her to hate him legitimately  15  Freed of Psycho Man s influence  Susan  off panel  did something to Psycho Man  causing him to let out a terrifying scream  16  After she rejoined her teammates  Susan stated that Psycho Man would never hurt anyone ever again  Susan found herself profoundly affected by the entire episode  and decided to change her code name from  Invisible Girl  to  Invisible Woman   17  Along with Reed  she briefly left the Fantastic Four  18  Finding a life outside the Fantastic Four  Reed and Sue were invited into the membership of the Avengers  19  The two of them were Avengers briefly  but rejoined the Fantastic Four before long  20  During the Infinity War  Susan was forced to face off against Malice  who had reemerged in Sue s subconscious  After defeating Malice  Susan absorbed Malice into her own consciousness  Subsequently  Susan s personality was influenced by Malice  causing her to become more aggressive in battle  even creating invisible razor like force fields she used to slice enemies  She also took to wearing a more revealing costume  which included a cut out  4  in the chest  showing her cleavage  Her son Franklin  who had traveled forward and back in time  had become the adult hero Psi Lord  and he was able to free his mother and absorb the influence of Malice into himself  He eventually defeated Malice by projecting her into the mind of the Dark Raider  an insane alternate universe counterpart of Reed Richards who later died in the Negative Zone  After the apparent death of Reed  Susan found herself becoming a capable leader  Around this time  Susan  who felt Reed was still alive  kept searching for him  despite romantic advances from her old flame  Namor the Sub Mariner  The Fantastic Four eventually rescued the time displaced Reed  who found himself temporarily losing confidence in his leadership skills  since Susan was also a capable leader  Following their return to their Earth of origin  the Fantastic Four encountered Valeria von Doom  This new Marvel Girl came from an alternate future  where she was the child of Susan and Doctor Doom  Susan eventually came to accept the young girl as a friend  During a conflict with Abraxas  Franklin revealed that he used his abilities to save Susan s original stillborn child and placed it in another alternate future  After the ordeal involving Abraxas  Marvel Girl was restored to a baby again inside Susan s womb  This time around  Susan  yet again  had a difficult birthing  Due to the help of Doctor Doom  Susan was able to give birth to a healthy baby girl  which Doom named Valeria  his price for helping Sue     or so she thought  Doom placed a spell on the baby  which made her his familiar spirit  to be used against the Fantastic Four  The Fantastic Four wrestled Valeria free from Doom s control and defeated him   edit  Sue  the Human Torch Zius  leader of a group of Galactus refugees  kidnaps Susan  His intent was to use her powers to hide planets from Galactus  Reed finds a way to fool Zius  by switching Susan and Johnny s powers  Susan assists in an adventure where Johnny becomes a herald of Galactus  Wielding a cosmic version of her powers  Johnny is able to see through people to the very cores of their personality  Both Sue and Johnny gain a newfound respect for each other and how they deal with their powers  Soon  Reed tries to switch the powers back  The entire FF s powers are granted to four random civilians before being restored to their rightful wielders  This parallels an earlier torture by Doom  where Sue was given an extremely painful version of Johnny s pyrokinetic ability   edit  Anti Registration Movement Sue s brother Johnny  enjoying a night on the town with a date  is beaten up in front of a nightclub by locals angered because his superhero celebrity status affords him easy entry into the club while they are forced to wait in line  along with thinking he isn t worthy of his status anymore in the aftermath of the Stamford incident  Although Sue was initially part of the Pro Registration force supporting the Superhuman Registration Act  she defects after the Thor Clone  created by her husband Mister Fantastic and Tony Stark  kills famed superhero Bill Foster  In the midst of the battle  Sue arrives and creates an invisible force shield around Captain America s Secret Avengers  protecting them from Thor s lightning blasts and allowing them to escape whilst she held him off   developing a nose bleed in the process  Later that night  Sue leaves the Baxter Building and meets Johnny  She has left a note for the sleeping Reed  informing him that the children are entirely in his care  since she intends to go underground and join Captain America s resistance forces  Her final injunction to her husband is a heartfelt request   Please fix this   The Storm siblings narrowly escape a team of S H I E L D  agents bent on capturing them in Civil War  5  The two further elude detection by operating under fake husband and wife identities provided by Nick Fury  becoming members of Captain America s Secret Avengers  Before storming the Negative Zone prison  Sue visits Namor to plead for assistance  He refuses and indicates she is still attracted to him  an accusation she does not deny  During the final battle depicted in Civil War  7  as Susan is about to be shot by Taskmaster  Reed Richards jumps in front of her and takes the brunt of the attack  sustaining a major injury  Outraged  Susan beats Taskmaster into the ground  leaving a large circular indentation in the Earth  Following the end of the war  Susan helps with the clean up of New York City  She  along with the other Secret Avengers  has been granted amnesty  and she returns home to Reed  Seeking to repair the damage done to their marriage as a result of the war  Sue and Reed take

Madison Square Garden into a gladiatorial arena  Sue and the other defeated heroes are held captive in a lower level  The heroes are outfitted with the same obedience disks that were used to suppress

nanny for their kids  Tabitha Deneuve  At the same time  a mysterious new group  calling themselves the New Defenders  commits robberies  and one of their members  Psionics  starts a relationship with Johnny  After a bad break up  Johnny is kidnapped by the Defenders  along with Doctor Doom and Galactus  to power a massive machine that is designed to apparently save the people of the future 500 years from now  a plan orchestrated by Tabitha  who is revealed to be Susan Richards from 500 years in the future  21  Eventually  the present Fantastic Four are able to save both the present Earth and the future Earth by sending the future inhabitants to the Earth Trust s private duplicate Nu Earth  but after freeing Doctor Doom  the future Sue goes to apologize to him  and is electrocuted by Doom  21   edit  Secret Invasion  Fantastic Four While Susan is on a lecture tour in Vancouver  B C   a Skrull posing as Mister Fantastic ambushes her  applying pressure to her skull with an invisible force field and knocking her out cold  Then  a Skrull infiltrates the Baxter Building disguised as Susan and opens a portal into the Negative Zone  forcing the top three floors of the building into the Negative Zone  and in turn trapping herself  Johnny  Ben  and the two Richards children there  The Skrull impersonating her is later revealed to be Johnny s ex wife Lyja  22  who once infiltrated the Fantastic Four by impersonating Ben Grimm s love interest Alicia Masters  23  The real Susan Richards is recovered alive from a downed Skrull ship after the final battle of the invasion  24   edit  Powers and abilities As the Invisible Woman  Susan can render herself wholly or partially invisible at will  She can also render other people or objects invisible  affecting up to forty thousand cubic feet of volume  She achieves these feats by mentally bending all wavelengths of light in the vicinity around herself or the target in question  and she does this without causing any visible distortion effects  she also directs enough undistorted light to her eyes to retain her full range of vision while invisible  She can also use her powers to turn objects of similar size that are invisible by other means visible  Sue can also mentally generate a psionic field of invisible force apparently drawn from hyperspace  which she manipulates for a variety of effects  Most commonly  Sue generates near indestructible invisible force fields around herself or other targets  She can vary the texture and tensile strength of her field to some extent  rendering it highly rigid or as soft and yielding as foam  softer variations on the field enable her to cushion impacts more gently  and are less likely to result in a psionic backlash against Sue herself  in rare cases  sufficiently powerful attacks on her psionic fields can cause her mental or physical pain   She is also able to make her shields opaque or translucent like Milk glass to effectively block variations of light such as laser beams  or make them semipermeable to filter oxygen from water though the latter is mentally taxing  Sue can shape her psionic force fields into invisible constructs  usually simple shapes such as barriers  columns  cones  cylinders  darts  discs  domes  platforms  rams  ramps  slides and spheres  By generating additional force behind her psionic constructs  Sue can turn them into offensive weapons  ranging from massive invisible battering rams to small projectiles such as spheres and darts  She can generate solid force constructs as small as a marble or as large as 100 feet  30 m  in diameter  and her hollow projections such as domes can extend up to several miles in area  By forming one of her force fields within an object and expanding the field  Sue can cause her target to explode  She can also travel atop animated constructs such as ramps  stairs  slides  columns and stepping discs  enabling her to fly  She can manipulate the energy of her force fields around other objects to simulate telekinetic abilities  It has been said on numerous occasions  including by the Fantastic Four s greatest opponent  Doctor Doom  that Sue is the single most powerful member of the quartet and she is one of the only beings able to rupture the shell of a Celestial  25  She is capable of generating and manipulating multiple force fields simultaneously  This power is only limited by her concentration  once she stops concentrating on a field  it simply ceases to exist  Susan is also a competent hand to hand combatant and martial artist  having been trained by Iron Fist  26  and having received additional coaching from both the Thing and She Hulk  Her unparalleled sense of compassion and common sense makes her a natural born leader  and she usually acts as the Fantastic Four s second in command  usually taking over complete leadership of the team during Mr  Fantastic s absence   edit  Other versions  edit  1602 In the miniseries Marvel 1602  Susan Storm is

the island  The ship was full of a contingent of human refugees  however  a mutant sabotaged the launch and both Reed and Johnny sacrificed themselves to let the others blast off safely  27  Susie and Ben joined the Human High Council as hired muscle  They were sent to the Eurasian Security Field Command Center to retrieve Bruce Banner  the scientist who worked on the nuclear warhead project that made the Council s pre emptive nuclear strike possible  But they found the facilities barraged and run over by a Thing  The two were able to defeat the monster and retrieve Banner so that they could board Mikhail Rasputin s mothership as one of a few select representatives allowed to board the Horseman s vessel as part of a false peace convoy  The humans were hoodwinked and held captive on the ship until Tony Stark  another captive on Mikhail s vessel  short circuited the craft with his mechanized heart  After they were freed  Ben and Susan helped with the evacuation of the humans  piloting
