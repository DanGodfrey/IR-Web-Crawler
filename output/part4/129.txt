Government owned corporation From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search This article needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   February 2010  A government owned corporation  state owned company  state owned entity  state enterprise  publicly owned corporation  government business enterprise  or parastatal is a legal entity created by a government to undertake commercial activities on behalf of an owner government  Their legal status varies from being a part of government into stock companies with a state as a regular stockholder  There is no standard definition of a government owned corporation  GOC  or state owned enterprise  SOE   although the two terms can be used interchangeably  The defining characteristics are that they have a distinct legal form and they are established to operate in commercial affairs  While they may also have public policy objectives  GOCs should be differentiated from other forms of government agencies or state entities established to pursue purely non financial objectives  1  Contents 1

Definitions GOCs can be fully owned or partially owned by Government  As a definitional issue  it is difficult to determine categorically what level of state ownership would qualify an entity to be considered as  state owned   since governments can also own regular stock  without implying any special interference  As an example  the Chinese Investment Corporation agreed in 2007 to acquire a 9 9  interest in the global investment bank Morgan Stanley  but it is unlikely that this would qualify the latter as a government owned corporation  Government owned or state run enterprises are often the result of corporatization  a process in which government agencies and departments are re organized as semi autonomous corporate entities  sometimes with partial shares listed on stock exchanges  The term government linked company  GLC  is sometimes used to refer to corporate entities that may be private or public  listed on a stock exchange  where an existing government owns a stake using a holding company  There are two main definitions of GLCs are dependent on the proportion of the corporate entity a government owns  One definition purports that a company is classified as a GLC if a government owns an effective controlling interest   gt 50    while the second definition suggests that any corporate entity that has a government as a shareholder is a GLC  A quasi governmental organization  corporation  business  or agency  parastatal  or a  quasi autonomous national government organisation   Quango  is an entity that is treated by national laws and regulations to be under the guidance of the government  but also separate and autonomous from the government  While the entity may receive some revenue from charging customers for its services  these organizations are often partially or majorly funded by the government  They are usually considered highly important to smooth running of society  and are sometimes propped up with cash infusions in times of crisis to help surmount situations that would bankrupt a normal privately owned business  They may also possess law enforcement authority  usually related to their functions   edit  Economic sectors Government owned corporations often operate in sectors where there is a natural monopoly  or where the government has strategic interest  However  government ownership of industry corporations is common  Nationalization also forcibly converts a private corporation into a government owned corporation  In most OPEC countries  the governments own the oil companies operating on their soil  A notable example is the Saudi national oil company  Saudi Aramco  which the Saudi government bought in 1988 and changed its name from Arabian American Oil Company to Saudi Arabian Oil Company  The Saudi government also owns and operates Saudi Arabian Airlines  and owns 70  of SABIC  as well as many other companies  They are  however  being privatized gradually   edit  Commonwealth In monarchical Commonwealth countries  particularly Australia  Canada and New Zealand  country wide government corporations often use the style  Crown corporation   Equivalent terms include  State owned enterprises  and  Crown entities  in New Zealand  and Government Business Enterprise  GBE  in Australia  Examples of Crown corporations include the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and Air Canada before the latter underwent privatization  Cabinet ministers  Ministers of the Crown  often control the shares in such public corporations  At the level of local government  territorial or other authorities may set up government corporations such as  Local Authority Trading Enterprises   LATEs   Many local authorities establish services such as water supply as separate corporations or as a business unit of the authority   edit  Australia In Australia the predominant term used for Commonwealth government owned companies is  government business enterprise   GBE   Various States also have GBEs  especially with respect to the provision of water and sewerage  however many State based GBEs have been privatised in some States during the last decade of the twentieth century  Four prominent Commonwealth GBEs include  Australian Broadcasting Corporation   fully owned and funded Special Broadcasting Service   fully owned and combines government funding and commercial funding Australia Post   Australian Postal Service NBNCo   fully owned and responsible for the rollout of the National Broadband Network These corporations are a part of the Department of Broadband  Communications and the Digital Economy and currently report to Senator Stephen Conroy   edit  Privatisation Former Commonwealth government owned corporations include Telstra  established in the 1970s as Telecom Australia  This company is Australia s leading telecommunications company  and was privatised in 1997 by former Prime Minister of Australia  John Howard  As of June 2010 Telstra owned a majority of the copper wire infrastructure in Australia  the rest owned by Optus  and is pending sale to its former parent  the Australian Government for a non binding amount of  11 Billion AUD  as ducts in the copper wire tunnels are needed to install the Fibre Optic cable  In Victoria many GBEs were sold off in the 1990s to reduce the then significant State deficit  most notably the retail operations of utilities such as public transport  electricity and gas  whilst the associated infrastructure was retained in State ownership   edit  Canada Main article  Crown corporations of Canada In Canada  state owned corporations often use the style Crown corporation  indicating that an organization is established by law  owned by the sovereign  and overseen by parliament and the Cabinet  Examples of crown corporations include the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation  Canada Post  and ViaRail  Former crown corporations before their privatization include Air Canada  St  Lawrence Seaway Authority  and Petro Canada  Ministers of the Crown often control the shares in such public corporations  while parliament both sets out the laws that create and bind Crown corporations and sets their annual budgets  Crown Corporations also exist at the provincial level in Canada  Saskatchewan has maintained the largest number of crown corporations  including SaskEnergy  SaskPower  SaskTel  SaskWater  and Saskatchewan Government Insurance  Crown corporations of British Columbia include BC Hydro  BC Ferries  and the British Columbia Lottery Corporation  Privatization  or the selling of crown corporations to private interests  is very common throughout Canada  Petro Canada  Canadian National Railway  and Air Canada are examples of former federal crown corporations that have been privatized  At the provincial level  privatized former crown corporations include Alberta Government Telephones  which merged with privately owned BC Tel to form Telus   BCRIC  Manitoba Telecom Services  and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan which retained its name and has become the world s largest producer of potash   edit  New Zealand In New Zealand  the terms used for government owned companies include  state owned enterprises  and  crown entities   Local government councils and similar authorities also set up government corporations  such as water supply companies and  local authority trading enterprises   LATEs   New Zealand   as separate corporations or business unit of the councils concerned   edit  Europe In Western Europe there was a massive nationalization throughout the 20th century  especially after World War II to ensure Government control over natural monopolies and to some extent industry  Typical sectors included telecommunications  power  petroleum  railways  airports  airlines  public transport  health care  postal services and sometimes banks  Many large industrial corporations were also nationalized or created as Government corporations  including among many British Steel  Statoil and Irish Sugar  Starting in the late 1970s and accelerating through the 1980s and 1990s many of these corporations were privatized  though many still remain wholly or partially owned by the respective governments  A state run enterprise needs to be distinguished from an ordinary limited liability corporation owned by the state  For example  in Finland  state run enterprises  liikelaitos  are governed by a separate act  Even though responsible for their own finances  they cannot be declared bankrupt  the state answers for the liabilities  Stocks of the corporation are not sold and loans have to be government approved  as they are government liabilities  In contrast  the state also owns controlling interest in ordinary limited liability corporations  A state run enterprise is technically not always a corporation  it might also be a separate state entity  or simply a governmental agency acting as an enterprise  perhaps having its own budget  Conversely  the state can directly fund unprofitable business  such as railway services to remote areas  regardless of whether the operator is a private corporation   edit  Russia In Russia and some other post Soviet states  unitary enterprises are commercial organizations that have no ownership rights to the assets they use in their operations  This form is possible only for state and municipal enterprises  operating with state or municipal property  respectively  The owners of the property of a unitary enterprise have no responsibility for its operation and vice versa  The assets of unitary enterprises belong to the Federal government  a Russian region  or a municipality  A unitary enterprise holds assets under the right of economic management  for both state and municipal unitary enterprises  or operative management  for state unitary enterprises only   and that such assets may not be distributed among the participants  nor otherwise divided  A unitary enterprise is independent in economic issues and obliged only to give its profits to the state  Unitary enterprises would have no right to set up subsidiaries  but  with the owner s consent  can open branches and representation offices  An example of such an enterprise is Mashpriborintorg  By contrast  a state corporation  Russian                              is a non profit organization which manages its assets as described in its charter  State Corporations are not obliged to submit to public authorities documents accounting for activities  except for a number of documents submitted to the Russian government  and  as a rule  are subordinate not to the government  but to the Russian president  and act to accomplish some important goal  Control of the Government is implemented on the basis of annual corporation  annual report on the audit opinion of accounting and financial reporting  accounting   as well as the conclusion of the auditing commission on the results of verification of financial  accounting  statements and other corporation documents  Any other federal government departments  organs of state power of subjects of the Russian Federation  the local governments have no right to interfere in the activities of the State corporation   edit  Asia  edit  Afghanistan In 2009  the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan formed the Afghan Public Protection Force  APPF  as a  state owned enterprise  subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior  By Presidential Decree  the APPF is mandated to replace all non diplomatic private security companies by 20 March 2013 to become the sole provider of pay for service security contracts within Afghanistan  2   edit  India In India  a government owned corporation is termed as a public sector undertaking  PSU   This term

Tobacco  JT  were formerly owned by the government   edit  People s Republic of China After 1949  all business entities in the People s Republic of China were created and owned by the government  In the late 1980s  the government began to reform the state owned enterprise  and during the 1990s and 2000s  many mid sized and small sized state owned enterprises were privatized and went public  There are a number of different corporate forms which result in a mixture of public and private capital  In PRC terminology  a state owned enterprise refers to a particular corporate form  which is increasingly being replaced by the listed company  State owned enterprises are governed by both local governments and  in the central government  the national State owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission   edit  Republic of China  Taiwan  The founding father of the Republic of China and of the Kuomintang  Sun Yat sen  was heavily influenced by the economic ideas of Henry George  who believed that the rents extracted from natural monopolies or the usage of land belonged to the public  Sun argued for Georgism and emphasized the importance of a mixed economy  which he termed  The Principle of Minsheng  in his Three Principles of the People   The railroads  public utilities  canals  and forests should be nationalized  and all income from the land and mines should be in the hands of the State  With this money in hand  the State can therefore finance the social welfare programs   4  Kuomintang leader  and later President of the Republic of China on the mainland and Taiwan  Chiang Kai shek  crushed pro communist worker and peasant organizations  and the rich Shanghai capitalists at the same time  Chiang continued Sun Yat sen s anti capitalist ideology  Kuomintang media openly attacked the capitalists and capitalism  demanding government controlled industry instead  5  The Kuomintang Muslim Governor of Ningxia  Ma Hongkui promoted state owned monopoly companies  His government had a company  Fu Ning Company  which had a monopoly over commercial and industry in Ningxia  6  Under the Kuomintang Muslim General Ma Bufang in Qinghai  Industries and projects such as educational  medical  agricultural  and sanitation schemes were controlled by the state  7  The Chinese Muslim 36th Division  National Revolutionary Army  governed southern Xinjiang from 1934 to

 Americas  edit  United States The government sponsored enterprises  GSEs  are a group of financial services corporations created by the United States Congress  The United States GSEs are private corporations owned by their stockholders  rather than government owned corporations  Their primary function is to generate profits for their stockholders  but they are structured and regulated by the US government to enhance the availability and reduce the cost of credit to targeted borrowing sectors  Congress created the first GSE in 1916 with the creation of the Farm Credit System  it initiated GSEs in the home finance segment of the economy with the creation of the Federal Home Loan Banks in 1932  and it targeted education when it chartered Sallie Mae in 1972  although Congress allowed Sallie Mae to relinquish its government sponsorship and become a fully private institution via legislation in 1995   The residential mortgage borrowing segment is by far the largest of the borrowing segments in which the GSEs operate  Together  the three mortgage finance GSEs  Fannie Mae  Freddie Mac and the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks  have several quantify trillion dollars of on balance sheet

exercised these warrants  government sponsored enterprises include  Fannie Mae Farmer Mac Federal Home Loan Banks Freddie Mac The federal government chartered and owned corporations are a separate set of corporations chartered and owned by the federal government  which operate to provide public services  but unlike the federal agencies  Environmental Protection Agency  Bureau of Indian Affairs   or the federal independent commissions  e g  the Federal Communications Commission  the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  etc    they have a separate legal personality from the federal government  providing

that were not chartered or created by the federal government  but the federal government has come into possession of and operates  These are corporations temporarily in possession of the Government as a result of a seizure of property of a debtor to the Government  such as a delinquent taxpayer  Usually these are awaiting auction  and most are too small to note  There exists a second level of sovereign government in the United States after the federal government  those of the several states of which compose the United States  State governments are bodies sovereign  like the federal government  and other sovereigns  they have sovereign existence deriving from the consent of the sovereign people of their territories who created them and wrote their state constitution  they are not bodies corporate  as they are not created by the acquis of the federal government and exist with or without that Government s consent  As sovereigns  they have the power to hold radical title to land  to exercise the four fundamental powers  taxation  eminent domain  police power  and escheat  as well as numerous other powers  including the power to grant charters  and implicit in that power to charter is the power to charter corporations  which they do  extensively  The very vast majority of non governmental corporations in the United States are chartered by the states of the US  and not the federal government  this includes most charitable corporations  though some charities of national repute are chartered by the federal government  and not by a state government   non profit corporations  and for profit corporations  States  as sovereigns  also have the power to charter corporations that they own  control  or are responsible for the regulation and finance of  These include municipal corporations and state chartered and owned corporations  Municipal corporations are public corporations that have devolved  democratic control over local matters within a geographic region  they are often styled villages  towns  townships  cities  or counties  Though these municipal corporations are often regulated and sometimes financed by the state government  and often can collect taxes  they are arms length  non sovereign  devolved public entities  and a State government which charters them is not legally responsible for their debts in the event of a municipal bankruptcy  State government chartered and owned corporations are numerous and provide public services  Examples include North Dakota Mill and Elevator or South Dakota Public Broadcasting  Generally speaking  a statute passed by a state legislature specifically sets up a government owned company in order to undertake a specific public purpose with public funds or public property  Lotteries in the United States are also run by government corporations  such as the Georgia Lottery Corporation and many others  There exists a third level of sovereign government in the United States as well  the sovereignty of the Native American tribal governments  Native American tribes are comprehended as ancient sovereigns  established by their sovereign people since time immemorial  and recognized as sovereign by the federal government of the United States as well as the several states  and as such  the Native American  and Alaska Native  tribal governments have rights appertaining to sovereigns  including the power to hold radical title to land  to exercise the four fundamental powers  taxation  eminent domain  police power  and escheat  as well as other powers  for instance  the power to charter corporations and undertake public undertakings that might benefit their tribal citizens  Native Americans and Alaska Natives also being citizens of their respective US state  and also citizens of the United States  For example  a tribal council could establish a public service broadcaster along the lines of RTE and partially fund it with a television licence on tribal land and partially through advertising as a means of uniting the tribe and giving it a voice as well as a commercial venture  The Alaska Natives are particularly advanced in using their tribal sovereignty to incorporate corporations that are owned by and for the benefit of their tribal citizens and often compete in highly competitive economic sectors through the Alaska Native Regional Corporations  The Native American tribes in the lower 48 states often use their sovereignty and their ability to charter to compete using regulatory easements  for instance  Native American tribal corporations often trade in goods that are highly taxed in surrounding states  such as tobacco   or engage in activities that surrounding states have  for reasons of public policy  forbidden  such as the operation of casinos or gaming establishments  Most of these endeavors have proven very successful for Native American tribal sovereigns and their tribal corporations  bringing wealth into the hands of Native Americans   edit  Uruguay Uruguay had the first welfare state of Latin America under the presidency of Jos  Batlle y Ordo ez in 1904  Government owned corporations monopolize services such as electricity  UTE   land line communications  Antel  and water  OSE   Antel competes with private corporations in the cell phone lines and international telephony markets  citation needed  In 1992  under the presidency of Luis Alberto Lacalle  the government attempted to privatize all its companies  following the neoliberal Washington Consensus  However  a referendum won by 75  of the population kept the companies in the hands of the government  By the end of his term  president Lacalle alleged that he had achieved a successful modernisation of the companies  which had made them more efficient   edit  Summary This list is incomplete  you can help by expanding it  In this list  government owned corporations are classified on their legal status  silver color represents legal monopolies  where no competition is permitted  light green represents a corporation that has private competitors  yellow means that although competition is legally permitted  there are no other corporations de facto  and uncolored
