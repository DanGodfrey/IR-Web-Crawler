Croatia derives from Medieval Latin Cro tia  from Dux Croatorum   Duke of Croatians   attested in the Branimir Inscription  itself a derivation of North West Slavic  Xrovat   by liquid metathesis from proposed Common Slavic  Xorvat   from proposed Proto Slavic  Xarw t    X rvat   or  X rvat    x rvat    6  The origin of the name is uncertain  but is thought to be a Gothic or Indo Aryan term assigned to a Slavic tribe  7  The oldest preserved record of the Croatian ethnonym  x rvat  is of variable stem  attested in the Ba ka tablet in style zv n mir  kral  xr vat sk    Zvonimir  Croatian king    8  The first attestation of the Latin term is attributed to a charter of duke Trpimir from the year 852  The original is lost  and just a 1568 copy is preserved leading to doubts on the authenticity of the claim  9  The oldest preserved stone inscription is the 9th century Branimir Inscription  found near Benkovac   where Duke Branimir is styled as Dux Cruatorvm  The inscription is not dated accurately  however  Branimir ruled Croatia in 879 892  10  Prehistory and antiquity Main articles  Prehistoric Croatia  Illyria  and Dalmatia  Roman province  Tanais Tablet B  name Khoro thos highlighted  The area known as Croatia today was inhabited throughout the prehistoric period  Fossils of Neanderthals dating to the middle Palaeolithic period have been unearthed in northern Croatia  with the most famous and the best presented site in Krapina  11  Remnants of several Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultures were found in all regions of the country  12  The largest proportion of the sites is in the northern Croatia river valleys  and the most significant cultures whose presence was discovered include Star evo  Vu edol and Baden cultures  13  14  The Iron Age left traces of the early Illyrian Hallstatt culture and the Celtic La T ne culture  15  Much later  the region was settled by Liburnians and Illyrians  while the first Greek colonies were established on the Vis and Hvar  16  In 9 AD the territory of today s Croatia became part of the Roman Empire  Emperor Diocletian built a large palace in Split when he retired in AD 305  17  During the 5th century  one of the last Emperors of the Western Roman Empire  Julius Nepos  ruled his small empire from the palace  18  The period ends with Avar and Croat invasions in the first half of the 7th century and destruction of almost all Roman towns  Roman survivors retreated to more favourable sites on the coast  islands and mountains  The city of Dubrovnik was founded by such survivors from Epidaurum  19  The ethnogenesis of Croats is uncertain and there are several competing theories  Slavic and Iranian being the most frequently put forward  The most widely accepted of these  the Slavic theory  proposes migration of White Croats from the territory of White Croatia during the Migration Period  Conversely  the Iranian theory proposes Iranian origin  based on Tanais Tablets containing Greek inscription of given names                       and           Khoro athos  Khoro thos  and Khor athos  and their interpretation as anthroponyms of Croatian people  20  Middle Ages Main articles  Kingdom of Croatia  medieval  and Republic of Ragusa Ba ka tablet  the oldest evidence of the glagolitic script  According to the work De Administrando Imperio written by the 10th century Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII  the Croats had arrived in what is today Croatia in the early 7th century  however that claim is disputed and competing hypotheses date the event between the 6th and the 9th centuries  21  Eventually two dukedoms were formed Duchy of Pannonia and Duchy of Dalmatia  ruled by Ljudevit Posavski and Borna  as attested by chronicles of Einhard starting in the year 818  The record represents the first document of Croatian realms  vassal states of Francia at the time  22  The Frankish overlordship ended during the reign of Mislav two decades later  23  According to the Constantine VII christianization of Croats began in the 7th century  but the claim is disputed and generally christianization is associated with the 9th century  24  The first native Croatian ruler recognised by the Pope was duke Branimir  whom Pope John VIII referred to as Dux Croatorum   Duke of Croats   in 879  10  The walls of Dubrovnik  which helped the defence of Dubrovnik in the Middle Ages and the 1991 1992 siege Tomislav was the first ruler of Croatia who was styled a king in a letter from the Pope John X  dating kingdom of Croatia to year 925  Tomislav defeated Hungarian and Bulgarian invasions  spreading the influence of Croatian kings  25  The medieval Croatian kingdom reached its peak in the 11th century during the reigns of Petar Kre imir IV  1058 1074  and Dmitar Zvonimir  1075 1089   26  When Stjepan II died in 1091 ending the Trpimirovi  dynasty  Ladislaus I of Hungary claimed Croatian crown  Opposition to the claim led to a war and personal union of Croatia and Hungary in 1102  ruled by Coloman  27  For the next four centuries  the Kingdom of Croatia was ruled by the Sabor  parliament  and a Ban  viceroy  appointed by the king  28  The period saw increasing threat of Ottoman conquest and struggle against the Republic of Venice for control of coastal areas  The Venetians gained control over most of Dalmatia by 1428  with exception of the city state of Dubrovnik which became independent  Ottoman conquests led to the 1493 Battle of Krbava field and 1526 Battle of Moh cs  both ending in decisive Ottoman victories  King Louis II died at Moh cs  and in 1527  the Parliament on Cetin chose Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg as new ruler of Croatia  under the condition that he provide protection to Croatia against the Ottoman Empire while respecting its political rights  28  29  The period saw rise of native nobility such as the Frankopans and the  ubi s to prominence and ultimately numerous Bans from the two families  30  Habsburg Monarchy and Austria Hungary Main articles  Kingdom of Croatia  Habsburg   Croatian Ottoman Wars  and Austria Hungary Ban Josip Jela i  fought Hungarians in 1848 and 1849 Following the decisive Ottoman victories  Croatia was split into civilian and military territories  with the partition formed in 1538  The military territories would become known as the Croatian Military Frontier and were directly controlled by the Austrian emperor  Ottoman advances in the Croatian territory continued until the 1593 Battle of Sisak  the first decisive Ottoman defeat  and stabilisation of borders  During the Great Turkish War  1667 1698   Slavonia was regained but western Bosnia  which had been part of Croatia before the Ottoman conquest  remained outside Croatian control  29  The present day border between the two countries is a remnant of this outcome  Dalmatia  the southern part of the border  was similarly defined by the Fifth and the Seventh Ottoman Venetian Wars  31  The Ottoman wars instigated great demographic changes  Croats migrated towards Austria and the present day Burgenland Croats are direct descendants of these settlers  32  To replace the fleeing Croats the Habsburgs called on the Orthodox populations of Bosnia and Serbia to provide military service in the Croatian Military Frontier  Serb migration into this region peaked during the Great Serb Migrations of 1690 and 1737 39  33  Between 1797 and 1809 the First French Empire gradually occupied the entire eastern Adriatic coastline and a substantial part of its hinterland  ending the Venetian and the Ragusan republics  establishing the Illyrian Provinces  29  In response the Royal Navy started the blockade of the Adriatic Sea leading to the Battle of Vis in 1811  34  The Illyrian Provinces were captured by the Austrians in 1813  and absorbed by the Austrian Empire following the Congress of Vienna in 1815  This led to formation of the Kingdom of Dalmatia and restoration of the Croatian Littoral to the Kingdom of Croatia  now both under the same crown  35  The 1830s and 1840s saw romantic nationalism inspired the Croatian National Revival  a political and cultural campaign advocating unity of all South Slavs in the empire  Its primary focus was establishment of a standard language as a counterweight to Hungarian  along with promotion of Croatian literature and culture  36  During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 Croatia sided with the Austrians  Ban Josip Jela i  helping defeat the Hungarian forces in 1849  and ushering a period of Germanization policy  37  By the 1860s  failure of the policy became apparent  leading to the Austro Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and creation of a personal union between the crowns of the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary  The treaty left the issue of Croatia s status to Hungary  and the status was resolved by the Croatian Hungarian Settlement of 1868  when kingdoms of Croatia and Slavonia were united  38  The Kingdom of Dalmatia remained under de facto Austrian control  while Rijeka retained the status of Corpus separatum introduced in 1779  27  After Austria Hungary occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina following the 1878 Treaty of Berlin  the Croatian Military Frontier was abolished and the territory returned to Croatia in 1881  29  Renewed efforts to reform Austria Hungary  entailing federalisation with Croatia as a federal unit  were stopped by advent of World War I  39  Kingdom of Yugoslavia and World War II Main articles  Creation of Yugoslavia  Kingdom of Yugoslavia  Banovina of Croatia  Independent State of Croatia  and Yugoslav Front HSS leader Stjepan Radi  On 29 October 1918 the Croatian Sabor declared independence and decided to join the newly formed State of Slovenes  Croats and Serbs  28  which in turn entered into union with the Kingdom of Serbia on 4 December 1918 to form the Kingdom of Serbs  Croats  and Slovenes  40  The 1921 constitution defining the country as a unitary state and abolition of historical administrative divisions effectively ended Croatian autonomy  The new constitution was opposed by the most widely supported national political party the Croatian Peasant Party  HSS  led by Stjepan Radi   41  The political situation deteriorated further as Radi  was assassinated in National Assembly in 1928  leading to the dictatorship of King Alexander in January 1929  42  The dictatorship formally ended in 1931 when the king imposed a more unitarian constitution  and changed the name of the country to Yugoslavia  43  The HSS  now led by Vladko Ma ek  continued to advocate federalization of Yugoslavia  resulting in the Cvetkovi  Ma ek Agreement of August 1939 and the autonomous Banovina of Croatia  The Yugoslav government retained control of defence  internal security  foreign affairs  trade  and transport while other matters were left to the Croatian Sabor and a crown appointed Ban  44  Resistance leader and Yugoslav president Marshal Josip Broz Tito In April 1941  Yugoslavia was occupied by Germany and Italy  Following the invasion the territory  parts of Croatia  Bosnia and Herzegovina  and the region of Syrmia were incorporated into the Independent State of Croatia  NDH   a Nazi backed puppet state  Parts of Dalmatia were annexed by Italy and the northern Croatian regions of Baranja and Me imurje were annexed by Hungary  45  The NDH regime was led by Ante Paveli  and ultranationalist Usta e  The regime introduced anti semitic laws and conducted a campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide against Serb and Roma inhabitants of the NDH  exemplified by the Jasenovac and Stara Gradi ka concentration camps  46  It is estimated that out of 39 000 Jews in the country only 9 000 survived  the rest were either killed or deported to Germany  both by the local authorities and the German Army itself  47  Croatian and Serbian sources disagree on the exact figures  48  Furthermore a total of around 320 000 to 334 000 Serbs were estimated to have been killed in the territory of present day Croatia and Bosnia Herzegovina roughly corresponding to NDH territory  of all causes   either by the regime  as members of armed resistance  or as Axis collaborators  49  In total the estimated number of Serb casualties throughout Yugoslavia in the war was around 537 000  49  At the same time  around 200 000 Croats were estimated to have been killed during World War II  likewise in various roles  48  49  clarification needed  A resistance movement soon emerged  On 22 June 1941 50  the 1st Sisak Partisan Detachment was formed near Sisak  as the first military unit formed by a resistance movement in occupied Europe  51  This sparked the beginning of the Yugoslav Partisan movement  a communist multi ethnic anti fascist resistance group led by Josip Broz Tito  52  The movement grew rapidly and at the Tehran Conference in December 1943 the Partisans gained recognition from the Allies  53  With Allied support in logistics  equipment  training and air power  and with the assistance of Soviet troops taking part in the 1944 Belgrade Offensive  Partisans gained control of Yugoslavia and border regions of Italy and Austria by May 1945  Political aspirations of the movement were reflected in the ZAVNOH  National Anti Fascist Council of the People s Liberation of Croatia   which developed in 1943 as the bearer of Croatian statehood and later transformed into the Parliament of Croatia in 1945  and AVNOJ its counterpart at Yugoslav level  54  55  Federal Yugoslavia and independence Main articles  Socialist Republic of Croatia and Croatian War of Independence A Yugoslav tank destroyed during the Battle of Vukovar After the World War II  Croatia became a single party Socialist federal unit of the SFR Yugoslavia  ruled by the Communists  but enjoying a degree of autonomy within the federation  In 1967  Croatian authors and linguists published a Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Standard Language demanding greater autonomy for Croatian language  56  The declaration contributed to a national movement seeking greater civil rights and decentralization of the Yugoslav economy  culminating in the Croatian Spring of 1971  suppressed by Yugoslav leadership  57  Still  the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution gave increased autonomy to federal units  basically fulfilling a goal of the Croatian Spring  and providing a legal basis for independence of the federative constituents  58  In the 1980s the political situation in Yugoslavia deteriorated with national tension fanned by the 1986 Serbian SANU Memorandum and the 1989 coups in Vojvodina  Kosovo and Montenegro  59  60  In January 1990  the Communist Party fragmented along national lines  with the Croatian faction demanding a looser federation  61  In the same year  the first multi party elections were held in Croatia  with Franjo Tu man s win raising nationalist tensions further  62 Serbs in Croatia left Sabor and declared the autonomy of areas that would soon become the unrecognized Republic of Serbian Krajina  intent on achieving independence from Croatia  63  64  As tensions rose  Croatia declared independence in June 1991  however the declaration came into effect on 8 October 1991  65  66  The tensions escalated into the Croatian War of Independence when the Yugoslav National Army and various Serb paramilitaries attacked Croatia  67  By the end of 1991  a high intensity war fought along a wide front reduced Croatia to control of about two thirds of its territory  68  69  On 15 January 1992  Croatia gained diplomatic recognition by the European Economic Community members  and subsequently the United Nations  70  71  The war effectively ended in 1995 with a decisive victory by Croatia in August 1995  72  The remaining occupied areas were restored to Croatia pursuant to the Erdut Agreement of November 1995  with the process concluded in January 1998  73  Geography Main article  Geography of Croatia Topographic map of Croatia Croatia is located in Central and Southeast Europe  bordering Hungary to the northeast  Serbia to the east  Bosnia and Herzegovina to the south east  Montenegro to the south east  the Adriatic Sea to the south west and Slovenia to the northwest  It lies mostly between latitudes 42  and 47  N and longitudes 13  and 20  E  Part of the territory in the extreme south surrounding Dubrovnik is a practical exclave connected to the rest of the mainland by territorial waters  but separated on land by a short coastline strip belonging to Bosnia and Herzegovina around Neum  74  The territory covers 56 594 square kilometres  21 851 square miles   consisting of 56 414 square kilometres  21 782 square miles  of land and 128 square kilometres  49 square miles  of water  It is the 127th largest country in the world  1  Elevation ranges from the mountains of the Dinaric Alps with the highest point of the Dinara peak at 1 831 metres  6 007 feet  near the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina in the south 1  to the shore of the Adriatic Sea which makes up its entire south west border  Insular Croatia consists of over a thousand islands and islets varying in size  48 of which are permanently inhabited  The largest islands are Cres and Krk  1  each of them having an area of around 405 km2  The hilly northern parts of Hrvatsko Zagorje and the flat plains of Slavonia in the east  which is part of the Pannonian Basin  are traversed by major rivers such as Sava  Drava  Kupa and Danube  The Danube  Europe s second longest river  runs through the city of Vukovar in the extreme east and forms part of the border with Serbia  The central and southern regions near the Adriatic coastline and islands consist of low mountains and forested highlands  Natural resources found in the country in quantities significant enough for production include oil  coal  bauxite  low grade iron ore  calcium  gypsum  natural asphalt  silica  mica  clays  salt and hydropower  1  Karst topography makes up about half of Croatia and is especially prominent in the Dinaric Alps  75  There are a number of deep caves in Croatia  49 of which are deeper than 250 m  820 21 ft   14 of them deeper than 500 m  1 640 42 ft  and three deeper than 1 000 m  3 280 84 ft   Croatia s most famous lakes are the Plitvice lakes  a system of 16 lakes with waterfalls connecting them over dolomite and limestone cascades  The lakes are renowned for their distinctive colours  ranging from turquoise to mint green  grey or blue  76  Climate Plitvice Lakes National Park  a UNESCO World Heritage Site Most of Croatia has a moderately warm and rainy continental climate as defined by the K ppen climate classification  Mean monthly temperature ranges between  3  C  27  F   in January  and 18  C  64  F   in July   The coldest parts of the country are Lika and Gorski Kotar where snowy forested climate is found at elevations above 1 200 metres  3 900 feet   The warmest areas of Croatia are at the Adriatic coast and especially in its immediate hinterland characterized by the Mediterranean climate  as the temperature highs are moderated by the sea  Consequently  temperature peaks are more pronounced in the continental areas the lowest temperature of  35 5  C   31 9  F  was recorded on 3 February 1919 in  akovec  and the highest temperature of 42 4  C  108 3  F  was recorded on 5 July 1950 in Karlovac  74  Mean annual precipitation ranges between 600 millimetres  24 inches  and 3 500 millimetres  140 inches  depending on geographic region and prevailing climate type  The least precipitation is recorded in the outer islands  Vis  Lastovo  Bi evo  Svetac  and in the eastern parts of Slavonia  however in the latter case  it is mostly occurring during the growing season  The maximum precipitation levels are observed on the Dinara mountain range and in Gorski kotar  Prevailing winds in the interior are light to moderate northeast or southwest  and in the coastal area prevailing winds are determined by local area features  Higher wind velocities are more often recorded in cooler months along the coast  generally as bura or less frequently as sirocco  The sunniest parts of the country are the outer islands  Hvar and Kor ula  where more than 2700 hours of sunshine are recorded per year  followed by the southern Adriatic Sea area in general  northern Adriatic coast  and Slavonia  all with more than 2000 hours of sunshine per year  74  Biodiversity Main article  Protected areas of Croatia Kopa ki Rit nature park  one of the largest wetlands in Europe Croatia can be subdivided between a number of ecoregions because of its climate and geomorphology  and the country is consequently one of the richest in Europe in terms of biodiversity  There are four types of biogeographical regions in Croatia Mediterranean along the coast and in its immediate hinterland  Alpine in most of Lika and Gorski Kotar  Pannonian along Drava and Danube  and continental in the remaining areas  One of the most significant are karst habitats which include submerged karst  such as Zrmanja and Krka canyons and tufa barriers  as well as underground habitats  The karst geology harbours approximately 7 000 caves and pits  some of which are habitat of the only known aquatic cave vertebrate the olm  Forests are also significantly present in the country  as they cover 2 490 000 hectares  6 200 000 acres  representing 44  of Croatian land surface  The other habitat types include wetlands  grasslands  bogs  fens  scrub habitats  coastal and marine habitats  77  In terms of phytogeography  Croatia is a part of the Boreal Kingdom and is a part of Illyrian and Central European provinces of the Circumboreal Region and the Adriatic province of the Mediterranean Region  The World Wide Fund for Nature divides Croatia between three ecoregions Pannonian mixed forests  Dinaric Mountains mixed forests and Illyrian deciduous forests  78  Karst in National Park Sjeverni Velebit There are 37 000 known species in Croatia  but their actual number is estimated to be between 50 000 and 100 000  77  The claim is supported by nearly 400 new taxa of invertebrates discovered in Croatia in the first half of the 2000s  decade  alone  77  There are more than a thousand endemic species  especially in Velebit and Biokovo mountains  Adriatic islands and karst rivers  Legislation protects 1 131 species  77  The most serious threat to them is loss and degradation of habitats  A further problem is presented by appearance of invasive alien species  especially Caulerpa taxifolia algae  The invasive algae are regularly monitored and removed to protect the benthic habitat  Indigenous sorts of cultivated plants and breeds of domesticated animals are also numerous  Those include five breeds of horses  five breeds of cattle  eight breeds of sheep  two breeds of pigs and a poultry breed  Even the indigenous breeds include nine endangered or critically endangered ones  77  There are 444 protected areas of Croatia  encompassing 9  of the country  Those include 8 national parks in Croatia  2 strict reserves and 10 nature parks  The most famous protected area and the oldest national park in Croatia is the Plitvice Lakes National Park  a UNESCO World Heritage Site  Velebit Nature Park is a part of the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme  The strict and special reserves  as well as the national and nature parks  are managed and protected by the central government  while other protected areas are managed by counties  In 2005  the National Ecological Network was set up  as the first step in preparation of the EU accession and joining of the Natura 2000 network  77  Politics Main articles  Politics of Croatia  List of political parties in Croatia
