figure in the history of both the poetry and visual arts of the Romantic Age  His prophetic poetry has been said to form  what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language   1  His visual artistry has led one contemporary art critic to proclaim him  far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced   2  Although he lived in London his entire life except for three years spent in Felpham 3  he produced a diverse and symbolically rich corpus  which embraced the imagination as  the body of God   4  or  Human existence itself   5  Considered mad by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic views  Blake is held in high regard by later critics for his expressiveness and creativity  and for the philosophical and mystical undercurrents within his work  His paintings and poetry have been characterised as part of both the Romantic movement and  Pre Romantic   6  for its large appearance in the 18th century  Reverent of the Bible but hostile to the Church of England   indeed  to all forms of organised religion   Blake was influenced by the ideals and ambitions of the French and American revolutions  7  as well as by such thinkers as Jakob B hme and Emanuel Swedenborg  8  Despite these known influences  the singularity of Blake s work makes him difficult to classify  The 19th century scholar William Rossetti characterised Blake as a  glorious luminary   9  and as  a man not forestalled by predecessors  nor to be classed with contemporaries  nor to be replaced by known or readily surmisable successors   10  Contents 1 Early life 1

plaque at William Blake House  a modern block of flats at 28 Broadwick St where Blake was born and lived until he was 25  William Blake was born on 28 November 1757 at 28 Broad Street  now Broadwick St  in the Soho district of London  He was the third of seven children  11  12  two of whom died in infancy  Blake s father  James  was a hosier  12  William attended school only long enough to learn reading and writing  leaving at the age of ten  and was otherwise educated at home by his mother Catherine Wright Armitage Blake  13  The Blakes were Dissenters  and are believed to have belonged to the Moravian Church  The Bible was an early and profound influence on Blake  and would remain a source of inspiration throughout his life  Blake started engraving copies of drawings of Greek antiquities purchased for him by his father  a practice that was then preferred to actual drawing  Within these drawings Blake found his first exposure to classical forms through the work of Raphael  Michelangelo  Marten Heemskerk and Albrecht D rer  His parents knew enough of his headstrong temperament that he was not sent to school but was instead enrolled in drawing classes  He read avidly on subjects of his own choosing  During this period  Blake was also making explorations into poetry  his early work displays knowledge of Ben Jonson and Edmund Spenser   edit  Apprenticeship to Basire The archetype of the Creator is a familiar image in Blake s work  Here  the demiurgic figure Urizen prays before the world he has forged  The Song of Los is the third in a series of illuminated books painted by Blake and his wife  collectively known as the Continental Prophecies  On 4 August 1772  Blake became apprenticed to engraver James Basire of Great Queen Street  for the term of seven years  12  At the end of this period  at the age of 21  he was to become a professional engraver  No record survives of any serious disagreement or conflict between the two during the period of Blake s apprenticeship  However  Peter Ackroyd s biography notes that Blake was later to add Basire s name to a list of artistic adversaries and then cross it out  14  This aside  Basire s style of engraving was of a kind held to be old fashioned at the time  15  and Blake s instruction in this outmoded form may have been detrimental to his acquiring of work or recognition in later life  After two years  Basire sent his apprentice to copy images from the Gothic churches in London  perhaps to settle a quarrel between Blake and James Parker  his fellow apprentice   His experiences in Westminster Abbey helped form his artistic style and ideas  The Abbey of his day was decorated with suits of armour  painted funeral effigies  and varicoloured waxworks  Ackroyd notes that     the most immediate  impression  would have been of faded brightness and colour   16  In the long afternoons Blake spent sketching in the Abbey  he was occasionally interrupted by the boys of Westminster School  one of whom  tormented  Blake so much one afternoon that he knocked the boy off a scaffold to the ground   upon which he fell with terrific Violence   17  Blake beheld more visions in the Abbey  of a great procession of monks and priests  while he heard  the chant of plain song and chorale    edit  Royal Academy On 8 October 1779  Blake became a student at the Royal Academy in Old Somerset House  near the Strand  While the terms of his study required no payment  he was expected to supply his own materials throughout the six year period  There  he rebelled against what he regarded as the unfinished style of fashionable painters such as Rubens  championed by the school s first president  Joshua Reynolds  Over time  Blake came to detest Reynolds  attitude towards art  especially his pursuit of  general truth  and  general beauty   Reynolds wrote in his Discourses that the  disposition to abstractions  to generalising and classification  is the great glory of the human mind   Blake responded  in marginalia to his personal copy  that  To Generalize is to be an Idiot  To Particularize is the Alone Distinction of Merit   18  Blake also disliked Reynolds  apparent humility  which he held to be a form of hypocrisy  Against Reynolds  fashionable oil painting  Blake preferred the Classical precision of his early influences  Michelangelo and Raphael  David Bindman suggests that Blake s antagonism towards Reynolds arose not so much from the president s opinions  like Blake  Reynolds held history painting to be of greater value than landscape and portraiture   but rather  against his hypocrisy in not putting his ideals into practice   19  Certainly Blake was not averse to exhibiting at the Royal Academy  submitting works on six occasions between 1780 and 1808  Blake became friends with John Flaxman  Thomas Stothard and George Cumberland during his first year at the Royal Academy  They shared radical views  with Stothard and Cumberland joining the Society for Constitutional Information  20   edit  Gordon Riots Blake s first biographer  Alexander Gilchrist  records that in June 1780 Blake was walking towards Basire s shop in Great Queen Street when he was swept up by a rampaging mob that stormed Newgate Prison in London  21  They attacked the prison gates with shovels and pickaxes  set the building ablaze  and released the prisoners inside  Blake was reportedly in the front rank of the mob during this attack  These riots  in response to a parliamentary bill revoking sanctions against Roman Catholicism  later came to be known as the Gordon Riots  They provoked a flurry of legislation from the government of George III  as well as the creation of the first police force  Despite Gilchrist s insistence that Blake was  forced  to accompany the crowd  some biographers have argued that he accompanied it impulsively  or supported it as a revolutionary act  22  In contrast  Jerome McGann argues that the riots were reactionary  and that events would have provoked  disgust  in Blake  23  Oberon  Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing  1786   edit  Marriage and early career Blake met Catherine Boucher in 1782  At the time  Blake was recovering from a relationship that had culminated in a refusal of his marriage proposal  He recounted the story of his heartbreak for Catherine and her parents  after which he asked Catherine   Do you pity me   When she responded affirmatively  he declared   Then I love you   Blake married Catherine   who was five years his junior   on 18 August 1782 in St  Mary s Church  Battersea  Illiterate  Catherine signed her wedding contract with an  X   The original wedding certificate may still be viewed at the church  where a commemorative stained glass window was installed between 1976 and 1982  24  Later  in addition to teaching Catherine to read and write  Blake trained her as an engraver  Throughout his life she would prove an invaluable aid to him  helping to print his illuminated works and maintaining his spirits throughout numerous misfortunes  Blake s first collection of poems  Poetical Sketches  was printed around 1783  25  After his father s death  William and former fellow apprentice James Parker opened a print shop in 1784  and began working with radical publisher Joseph Johnson  26  Johnson s house was a meeting place for some of the leading English intellectual dissidents of the time  theologian and scientist Joseph Priestley  philosopher Richard Price  artist John Henry Fuseli  27  early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft and Anglo American revolutionary Thomas Paine  Along with William Wordsworth and William Godwin  Blake had great hopes for the French revolution and American revolutions and wore a Phrygian cap in solidarity with the French revolutionaries  but despaired with the rise of Robespierre and the Reign of Terror in France  In 1784 Blake also composed his unfinished manuscript An Island in the Moon  Blake illustrated Original Stories from Real Life  1788  1791  by Mary Wollstonecraft  They seem to have shared some views on sexual equality and the institution of marriage  but there is no evidence proving without doubt that they actually met  In 1793 s Visions of the Daughters of Albion  Blake condemned the cruel absurdity of enforced chastity and marriage without love and defended the right of women to complete self fulfillment   edit  Relief etching In 1788  at the age of 31  Blake began to experiment with relief etching  a method he would use to produce most of his books  paintings  pamphlets and poems  The process is also referred to as illuminated printing  and final products as illuminated books or prints  Illuminated printing involved writing the text of the poems on copper plates with pens and brushes  using an acid resistant medium  Illustrations could appear alongside words in the manner of earlier illuminated manuscripts  He then etched the plates in acid to dissolve the untreated copper and leave the design standing in relief  hence the name   This is a reversal of the normal method of etching  where the lines of the design are exposed to the acid  and the plate printed by the intaglio method  Relief etching  which Blake also referred to as  stereotype  in The Ghost of Abel  was intended as a means for producing his illuminated books more quickly than via intaglio  Stereotype  a process invented in 1725  consisted of making a metal cast from a wood engraving  but Blake s innovation was  as described above  very different  The pages printed from these plates then had to be hand coloured in water colours and stitched together to make up a volume  Blake used illuminated printing for most of his well known works  including Songs of Innocence and Experience  The Book of Thel  The Marriage of Heaven and Hell  and Jerusalem  28   edit  Engravings Although Blake has become most famous for his relief etching  his commercial work largely consisted of intaglio engraving  the standard process of engraving in the eighteenth century in which the artist would incise an image into the copper plate  This was a complex and laborious process  with plates taking months or years to complete  but as Blake s contemporary  John Boydell  realised  such engraving offered a  missing link with commerce   enabling artists to connect with a mass audience and so becoming an immensely important activity by the end of the eighteenth century  29  Blake also employed intaglio engraving in his own work  most notably for the illustrations of the Book of Job  completed just before his death  Most critical work has tended to concentrate on Blake s relief etching as a technique because it is the most innovative aspect of his art  but a 2009 study draws attention to Blake s surviving plates  including those for the Book of Job  these demonstrate that he made frequent use of a technique known as  repoussage   a means of obliterating mistakes by hammering them out by hitting the back of the plate  Such techniques  typical of engraving work of the time  are very different to the much faster and fluid way of drawing on a plate that Blake employed for his relief etching  and indicates why the engravings took so long to complete  30   edit  Later life and career The cottage in Felpham where Blake lived from 1800 till 1803  Blake s marriage to Catherine remained a close and devoted one until his death  Blake taught Catherine to write  and she helped him to colour his printed poems  31  Gilchrist refers to  stormy times  in the early years of the marriage  32  Some biographers have suggested that Blake tried to bring a concubine into the marriage bed in accordance with the beliefs of the more radical branches of the Swedenborgian Society  33  but other scholars have dismissed these theories as conjecture  34  William and Catherine s first daughter and last child might be Thel described in The Book of Thel who was conceived as dead  35  The Night of Enitharmon s Joy  1795  Blake s vision of Hecate  Greek goddess of black magic and the underworld  edit  Felpham In 1800  Blake moved to a cottage at Felpham in Sussex  now West Sussex  to take up a job illustrating the works of William Hayley  a minor poet  It was in this cottage that Blake began Milton  a Poem  the title page is dated 1804 but Blake continued to work on it until 1808   The preface to this work includes a poem beginning  And did those feet in ancient time   which became the words for the anthem   Jerusalem   Over time  Blake came to resent his new patron  coming to believe that Hayley was uninterested in true artistry  and preoccupied with  the meer drudgery of business   E724   Blake s disenchantment with Hayley has been speculated to have influenced Milton  a Poem  in which Blake wrote that  Corporeal Friends are Spiritual Enemies    4 26  E98  Blake s trouble with authority came to a head in August 1803  when he was involved in a physical altercation with a soldier called John Schofield  36  Blake was charged not only with assault  but also with uttering seditious and treasonable expressions against the King  Schofield claimed that Blake had exclaimed   Damn the king  The soldiers are all slaves   37  Blake would be cleared in the Chichester assizes of the charges  According to a report in the Sussex county paper   The invented character of  the evidence  was     so obvious that an acquittal resulted   38  Schofield was later depicted wearing  mind forged manacles  in an illustration to Jerusalem  39   edit  Return to London Blake s The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with Sun  1805  is one of a series of illustrations of Revelation 12  Blake returned to London in 1804 and began to write and illustrate Jerusalem  1804 1820   his most ambitious work  Having conceived the idea of portraying the characters in Chaucer s Canterbury Tales  Blake approached the dealer Robert Cromek  with a view to marketing an engraving  Knowing that Blake was too eccentric to produce a popular work  Cromek promptly commissioned Blake s friend Thomas Stothard to execute the concept  When Blake learned that he had been cheated  he broke off contact with Stothard  He also set up an independent exhibition in his brother s haberdashery shop at 27 Broad Street in the Soho district of London  The exhibition was designed to market his own version of the Canterbury illustration  titled The Canterbury Pilgrims   along with other works  As a result he wrote his Descriptive Catalogue  1809   which contains what Anthony Blunt has called a  brilliant analysis  of Chaucer  It is regularly anthologised as a classic of Chaucer criticism  40  It also contained detailed explanations of his other paintings  The exhibition itself  however  was very poorly attended  selling none of the temperas or watercolours  Its only review  in The Examiner  was hostile  41  Also around this time  circa 1808  Blake gave vigorous expression of views on art in an extensive series of polemical annotations to the Discourses of Sir Joshua Reynolds  denouncing the British Academy as a fraud and proclaiming   To Generalize is to be an Idiot   42  In 1818 he was introduced by George Cumberland s son to a young artist named John Linnell  43  Through Linnell he met Samuel Palmer  who belonged to a group of artists who called themselves the Shoreham Ancients  This group shared Blake s rejection of modern trends and his belief in a spiritual and artistic New Age  At the age of 65 Blake began work on illustrations for the Book of Job  These works were later admired by Ruskin  who compared Blake favourably to Rembrandt  and by Vaughan Williams  who based his ballet Job  A Masque for Dancing on a selection of the illustrations  Later in his life Blake began to sell a great number of his works  particularly his Bible illustrations  to Thomas Butts  a patron who saw Blake more as a friend than a man whose work held artistic merit  this was typical of the opinions held of Blake throughout his life   edit  Dante s Divine Comedy William Blake s image of the Minotaur to illustrate Inferno  Canto XII 12 28  The Minotaur XII The commission for Dante s Divine Comedy came to Blake in 1826 through Linnell  with the ultimate aim of producing a series of engravings  Blake s death in 1827 would cut short the enterprise  and only a handful of the watercolours were completed  with only seven of the engravings arriving at proof form  Even so  they have evoked praise    T he Dante watercolours are among Blake s richest achievements  engaging fully with the problem of illustrating a poem of this complexity  The mastery of watercolour has reached an even higher level than before  and is used to extraordinary effect in differentiating the atmosphere of the three states of being in the poem   44  Blake s The Lovers  Whirlwind illustrates Hell in Canto V of Dante s Inferno Blake s illustrations of the poem are not merely accompanying works  but rather seem to critically revise  or furnish commentary on  certain spiritual or moral aspects of the text  Because the project was never completed  Blake s intent may itself be obscured  Some indicators  however  bolster the impression that Blake s illustrations in their totality would themselves take issue with the text they accompany  In the margin of Homer Bearing the Sword and His Companions  Blake notes   Every thing in Dantes Comedia shews That for Tyrannical Purposes he has made This World the Foundation of All  amp  the Goddess Nature  amp  not the Holy Ghost   Blake seems to dissent from Dante s admiration of the poetic works of ancient Greece  and from the apparent glee with which Dante allots punishments in Hell  as evidenced by the grim humour of the cantos   At the same time  Blake shared Dante s distrust of materialism and the corruptive nature of power  and clearly relished the opportunity to represent the atmosphere and imagery of Dante s work pictorially  Even as he seemed to near death  Blake s central preoccupation was his feverish work on the illustrations to Dante s Inferno  he is said to have spent one of the very last shillings he possessed on a pencil to continue sketching  45   edit  Death Monument near Blake s unmarked grave at Bunhill Fields in London On the day of his death  Blake worked relentlessly on his Dante series  Eventually  it is reported  he ceased working and turned to his wife  who was in tears by his bedside  Beholding her  Blake is said to have cried   Stay Kate  Keep just as you are   I will draw your portrait   for you have ever been an angel to me   Having completed this portrait  now lost   Blake laid down his tools and began to sing hymns and verses  46  At six that evening  after promising his wife that he would be with her always  Blake died  Gilchrist reports that a female lodger in the same house  present at his expiration  said   I have been at the death  not of a man  but of a blessed angel   47  George Richmond gives the following account of Blake s death in a letter to Samuel Palmer  He died     in a most glorious manner  He said He was going to that Country he had all His life wished to see  amp  expressed Himself Happy  hoping for Salvation through Jesus Christ   Just before he died His Countenance became fair  His eyes Brighten d and he burst out Singing of the things he saw in Heaven  48  Catherine paid for Blake s funeral with money lent to her by Linnell  He was buried five days after his death   on the eve of his forty fifth wedding anniversary   at the Dissenter s burial ground in Bunhill Fields  where his parents were also interred  Present at the ceremonies were Catherine  Edward Calvert  George Richmond  Frederick Tatham and John Linnell  Following Blake s death  Catherine moved into Tatham s house as a housekeeper  During this period  she believed she was regularly visited by Blake s spirit  She continued selling his illuminated works and paintings  but would entertain no business transaction without first  consulting Mr  Blake   49  On the day of her own death  in October 1831  she was as calm and cheerful as her husband  and called out to him  as if he were only in the next room  to say she was coming to him  and it would not be long now   50  On her death  Blake s manuscripts were inherited by Frederick Tatham  who burned several he deemed heretical or politically radical  Tatham was an Irvingite  one of the many fundamentalist movements of the 19th century  and was severely opposed to any work that smacked of blasphemy  51  Also  John Linnell erased sexual imagery from a number of Blake s drawings  52  Since 1965  the exact location of William Blake s grave had been lost and forgotten  while gravestones were taken away to create a new lawn  Nowadays  Blake s grave is commemorated by a stone that reads  Near by lie the remains of the poet painter William Blake 1757 1827 and his wife Catherine Sophia 1762 1831   This memorial stone is situated approximately 20 metres away from the actual spot of Blake s grave  which is not marked  However  members of the group Friends of William Blake have rediscovered the location of Blake s grave and intend to place a permanent memorial at the site  53  54  Blake is now recognised as a saint in the Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica  The Blake Prize for Religious Art was established in his honour in Australia in 1949  In 1957 a memorial was erected in Westminster Abbey  in memory of him and his wife  55   edit  Politics Blake was not active in any well established political party  His poetry consistently embodies an attitude of rebellion against the abuse of class power as documented in David Erdman s large study Blake  Prophet Against Empire  A Poet s Interpretation of the History of His Own Times  Blake was both concerned about senseless wars of kingdoms  and the blighting effects of the industrial revolution  Much of his poetry recounts in symbolic allegory the effects of the French and American revolutions  Erdman claims that Blake was disillusioned with these revolutions  believing they had simply replaced monarchy with irresponsible mercantilism  Erdman also notes that Blake was deeply opposed to slavery  and believes that some poems of Blake read primarily as championing  free love  have had their anti slavery implications short changed  56  One of the more recent  and very short  studies of Blake  William Blake  Visionary Anarchist by Peter Marshall  1988   has classified Blake as one of the forerunners of modern anarchism  along with Blake s contemporary William Godwin  57  The British Marxist historian E P  Thompson s last finished work was a study on William Blake  Witness Against the Beast  William Blake and the Moral Law  1993   and it shows how far Blake was inspired by dissident religious ideas rooted in the thinking of the most radical opponents of the monarchy during the English Civil War   edit  Development of Blake s views Because Blake s later poetry contains a private mythology with complex symbolism  his late work has been less published than his earlier more accessible work  The recent Vintage anthology of Blake edited by Patti Smith focuses heavily on the earlier work  as do many critical studies such as William Blake by D  G  Gillham  The earlier work is primarily rebellious in character and can be seen as a protestation against dogmatic religion  This is especially notable in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell in which the figure represented by Satan is virtually the hero rebelling against an imposter authoritarian deity  In the later works such as Milton and Jerusalem  Blake carves a distinctive vision of a humanity redeemed by self sacrifice and forgiveness  while retaining his earlier negative attitude towards what he felt was the rigid and morbid authoritarianism of traditional religion  Not all readers of Blake agree upon how much continuity exists between Blake s earlier and later works  Psychoanalyst June Singer has written that Blake s late work displayed a development of the ideas that were first introduced in his earlier works  namely  the humanitarian goal of achieving personal wholeness of body and spirit  The final section of the expanded edition of her Blake study The Unholy Bible suggests that the later works are in fact the  Bible of Hell  promised in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell  Regarding Blake s final poem  Jerusalem   she writes    T he promise of the divine in man  made in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell  is at last fulfilled   58  However  John Middleton Murry notes discontinuity between Marriage and the late works  in that while the early Blake focused on a  sheer negative opposition between Energy and Reason   the later Blake emphasised the notions of self sacrifice and forgiveness as the road to interior wholeness  This renunciation of the sharper dualism of Marriage of Heaven and Hell is evidenced in particular by the humanisation of the character of Urizen in the later works  Middleton characterises the later Blake as having found  mutual understanding  and  mutual forgiveness   59   edit  Sexuality  edit  19th century  free love  movement Since his death  William Blake has been claimed by various movements who apply his complex and often elusive use of symbolism and allegory to the issues that concern them  60  In particular  Blake is sometimes considered  along with Mary Wollstonecraft and her husband William Godwin  a forerunner of the subsequent 19th century  free love  movement  a broad reform tradition starting in the 1820s that held that marriage is slavery  and advocated for removal of all state restrictions on sexual activity such as homosexuality  prostitution  and adultery  culminating in the birth control movement of the early 20th century  Blake scholarship was more focused on this theme in the earlier 20th century than today  although it is still mentioned today notably by the Blake scholar Magnus Ankarsj  who moderately challenges this interpretation  The 19th century  free love  movement was not particularly focused on the idea of multiple partners  but did agree with Wollstonecraft that state sanctioned marriage was  legal prostitution  and was monopolistic in character  It has somewhat more in common with early feminist movements 61   particularly with regard to the writings of Mary Wollstonecraft  whom Blake admired   Blake was critical of the marriage laws of his day  and generally railed against traditional Christian notions of chastity as a virtue  At a time of tremendous strain in his marriage  in part due to Catherine s apparent inability to bear children  he directly advocated bringing a second wife into the house  His poetry suggests that external demands for marital fidelity reduce love to mere duty rather than authentic affection  and decries jealousy and egotism as a motive for marriage laws  Poems such as  Why should I be bound to thee  O my lovely Myrtle tree   and  Earth s Answer  seem to advocate multiple sexual partners  His poem  London  speaks of  the Marriage Hearse   Visions of the Daughters of Albion is widely  though not universally  read as a tribute to free love since the relationship between Bromion and Oothoon is held together only by laws and not by love  For Blake  law and love are opposed  and he castigates the  frozen marriage bed   In Visions  Blake writes Till she who burns with youth  and knows no fixed lot  is bound In spells of law to one she loathes  and must she drag the chain Of life in weary lust   5 21 3  E49  In the 19th century famed poet and free love advocate Algernon Charles Swinburne wrote a full length book on Blake drawing attention to the above motifs in which Blake praises  sacred natural love  that is not bound by another s possessive jealousy  the latter characterised by Blake as a  creeping skeleton   62  Swinburne also notes how Blake s Marriage of Heaven and Hell condemns the hypocrisy of the  pale religious letchery  of advocates of traditional norms  63  Another 19th century free love advocate  Edward Carpenter  1844 1929   was also influenced by Blake s mystical emphasis on energy free from external restrictions  64  In the early 20th century Pierre Berger described how Blake s views echo that of Mary Wollstonecraft celebrating joyful authentic love rather than love born of duty  65  the former being the true measure of purity  66  Irene Langridge notes that  in Blake s mysterious and unorthodox creed the doctrine of free love was something Blake wanted for the edification of  the soul    67  Michael Davis  1977 book William Blake a New Kind of Man suggests that Blake thought jealousy separates man from the divine unity  condemning him to a frozen death  68  As a theological writer  Blake has a sense of human  fallenness   S  Foster Damon has noted that for Blake the major impediments to a free love society were corrupt human nature  not merely the intolerance of society and the jealousy of men  but the inauthentic hypocritical nature of human communication  69  Thomas Wright s 1928 book Life of William Blake  entirely devoted to Blake s doctrine of free love  notes that Blake thinks marriage should in practice afford the joy of love  but notes that in reality it often does not  70  as a couple s knowledge of being chained often diminishes their joy  Pierre Berger also analyses Blake s early mythological poems such as Ahania as declaring marriage laws to be a consequence of the fallenness of humanity  as these are born from pride and jealousy  71  Some scholars have noted both that Blake s views on  free love  are both qualified and may have undergone shifts and modifications in his late years  Some poems from this period warn of dangers of predatory sexuality such as The Sick Rose  Magnus Ankarsj  notes that while the hero of Visions of the Daughters of Albion is a strong advocate of free love  by the end of the poem she has become more circumspect as her awareness of the dark side of sexuality has grown  crying  Can this be love which drinks another as a sponge drinks water   72  Ankarsj  also notes that a major inspiration to Blake  Mary Wollstonecraft  similarly developed more circumspect views of sexual freedom late in life  In light of Blake s aforementioned sense of human  fallenness  Ankarsj  thinks Blake does not fully approve of sensual indulgence merely in defiance of law as exemplified by the female character of Leutha  73  since in the fallen world of experience all love is enchained  74  Ankarsj  records Blake as having supported a commune with some sharing of partners  though David Worrall has recently read The Book of Thel as a rejection of the proposal to take concubines espoused by some members of the Swedenborgian church  75  Blake s later writings show a renewed interest in Christianity  and although he radically reinterprets Christian morality in a way that embraces sensual pleasure  there is little of the emphasis on sexual libertarianism found in several of his early poems  and there is advocacy of  self denial   though such abnegation must be inspired by love rather than through authoritarian compulsion  76  Berger  moreso than Swinburne  is especially sensitive to a shift in sensibility between the early Blake and the later Blake  Berger believes the young Blake placed too much emphasis on following impulses  77  and that the older Blake had a better formed ideal of a true love that sacrifices self  Some celebration of mystical sensuality remains in the late poems  most notably in Blake s denial of the virginity of Jesus  mother   However  the late poems also place a greater emphasis on forgiveness  redemption  and emotional authenticity as a foundation for relationships   edit  Religious views Blake s Ancient of Days  The  Ancient of Days  is described in Chapter 7 of the Book of Daniel  Although Blake s attacks on conventional religion were shocking in his own day  his rejection of religiosity was not a rejection of religion per se  His view of orthodoxy is evident in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell  a series of texts written in imitation of Biblical prophecy  Therein  Blake lists several Proverbs of Hell  amongst which are the following  Prisons are built with stones of Law  Brothels with bricks of Religion  As the catterpillar  sic  chooses the fairest leaves to lay her eggs on  so the priest lays his curse on the fairest joys   8 21  9 55  E36  In The Everlasting Gospel  Blake does not present Jesus as a philosopher or traditional messianic figure but as a supremely creative being  above dogma  logic and even morality  If he had been Antichrist Creeping Jesus  He d have done anything to please us  Gone sneaking into Synagogues And not us d the Elders  amp  Priests like Dogs  But humble as a Lamb or Ass  Obey d himself to Caiaphas  God wants not Man to Humble himself  55 61  E519 20  Jesus  for Blake  symbolises the vital relationship and unity between divinity and humanity   All had originally one language  and one religion  this was the religion of Jesus  the everlasting Gospel  Antiquity preaches the Gospel of Jesus    Descriptive Catalogue  Plate 39  E543  Blake designed his own mythology  which appears largely in his prophetic books  Within these Blake describes a number of characters  including  Urizen    Enitharmon    Bromion  and  Luvah   This mythology seems to have a basis in the Bible and in Greek mythology  78  and it accompanies his ideas about the everlasting Gospel   I must Create a System  or be enslav d by another Man s  I will not Reason  amp  Compare  my business is to Create   Words uttered by Los in Blake s Jerusalem  The Emanation of the Giant Albion  One of Blake s strongest objections to orthodox Christianity is that he felt it encouraged the suppression of natural desires and discouraged earthly joy  In A Vision of the Last Judgement  Blake says that  Men are admitted into Heaven not because they have  lt curbed  amp  gt  governd their Passions or have No Passions but because they have Cultivated their Understandings  The Treasures of Heaven are not Negations of Passion but Realities of Intellect from which All the Passions Emanate  lt Uncurbed gt  in their Eternal Glory   E564  One may also note his words concerning religion in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell  All Bibles or sacred codes have been the causes of the following Errors  1  That Man has two real existing principles Viz  a Body  amp  a Soul  2  That Energy  calld Evil  is alone from the Body   amp  that Reason  calld Good  is alone from the Soul  3  That God will torment Man in Eternity for following his Energies  But the following Contraries to these are True 1  Man has no Body distinct from his Soul for that calld Body is a portion of Soul discernd by the five Senses  the chief inlets of Soul in this age  2  Energy is the only life and is from the Body and Reason is the bound or outward circumference of Energy  3  Energy is Eternal Delight   Plate 4  E34  The Body of Abel Found by Adam and Eve  c  1825  Watercolour on wood  Blake does not subscribe to the notion of a body distinct from the soul that must submit to the rule of the soul  but sees the body as an extension of the soul  derived from the  discernment  of the senses  Thus  the emphasis orthodoxy places upon the denial of bodily urges is a dualistic error born of misapprehension of the relationship between body and soul  Elsewhere  he describes Satan as the  state of error   and as beyond salvation  79  Blake opposed the sophistry of theological thought that excuses pain  admits evil and apologises for injustice  He abhorred self denial  80  which he associated with religious repression and particularly sexual repression  81   Prudence is a rich ugly old maid courted by Incapacity    He who desires but acts not  breeds pestilence    7 4 5  E35  He saw the concept of  sin  as a trap to bind men s desires  the briars of Garden of Love   and believed that restraint in obedience to a moral code imposed from the outside was against the spirit of life  Abstinence sows sand all over The ruddy limbs  amp  flaming hair But Desire Gratified Plants fruits  amp  beauty there   E474  He did not hold with the doctrine of God as Lord  an entity separate from and superior to mankind  82  this is shown clearly in his words about Jesus Christ   He is the only God     and so am I  and so are you   A telling phrase in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell is  men forgot that All deities reside in the human breast   This is very much in line with his belief in liberty and social equality in society and between the sexes   edit  Enlightenment philosophy Blake had a complex relationship with Enlightenment philosophy  Due to his visionary religious beliefs  Blake opposed the Newtonian view of the universe  This mindset is reflected in an excerpt from Blake s Jerusalem  Blake s Newton  1795  demonstrates his opposition to the  single vision  of scientific materialism  Newton fixes his eye on a compass  recalling Proverbs 8 27  an important passage for Milton  83  to write upon a scroll that seems to project from his own head  84  I turn my eyes to the Schools  amp  Universities of Europe And there behold the Loom of Locke whose Woof rages dire Washd by the Water wheels of Newton  black the cloth In heavy wreathes folds over every Nation  cruel Works Of many Wheels I view  wheel without wheel  with cogs tyrannic Moving by compulsion each other  not as those in Eden  which Wheel within Wheel in freedom revolve in harmony  amp  peace   15 14 20  E159  Blake also believed that the paintings of Sir Joshua Reynolds  which depict the naturalistic fall of light upon objects  were products entirely of the  vegetative eye   and he saw Locke and Newton as  the true progenitors of Sir Joshua Reynolds  aesthetic   85  The popular taste in the England of that time for such paintings was satisfied with mezzotints  prints produced by a process that created an image from thousands of tiny dots upon the page  Blake saw an analogy between this and Newton s particle theory of light  86  Accordingly  Blake never used the technique  opting rather to develop a method of engraving purely in fluid line  insisting that  a Line or Lineament is not formed by Chance a Line is a Line in its Minutest Subdivision s  Strait or Crooked It is Itself  amp  Not Intermeasurable with or by any Thing Else Such is Job   E784  Despite his opposition to Enlightenment principles  Blake thus arrived at a linear aesthetic that was in many ways more similar to the Neoclassical engravings of John Flaxman than to the works of the Romantics  with whom he is often classified  Therefore Blake has also been viewed as an enlightenment poet and artist  in the sense that he was in accord with that movement s rejection of received ideas  systems  authorities and traditions  On the other hand  he was critical of what he perceived as the elevation of reason to the status of an oppressive authority  In his criticism of reason  law and uniformity Blake has been taken to be opposed to the enlightenment  but it has also been argued that  in a dialectical sense  he used the enlightenment spirit of rejection of external authority to criticise narrow conceptions of the enlightenment  87   edit  Assessment  edit  Creative mindset Northrop Frye  commenting on Blake s consistency in strongly held views  notes that Blake  himself says that his notes on  Joshua  Reynolds  written at fifty  are  exactly Similar  to those on Locke and Bacon  written when he was  very Young   Even phrases and lines of verse will reappear as much as forty years later  Consistency in maintaining what he believed to be true was itself one of his leading principles     Consistency  then  foolish or otherwise  is one of Blake s chief preoccupations  just as  self contradiction  is always one of his most contemptuous comments   88  Blake s  A Negro Hung Alive by the Ribs to a Gallows   an illustration to J  G  Stedman s Narrative  of a Five Years  Expedition  against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam  1796   Blake abhorred slavery and believed in racial and sexual equality  Several of his poems and paintings express a notion of universal humanity   As all men are alike  tho  infinitely various    In one poem  narrated by a black child  white and black bodies alike are described as shaded groves or clouds  which exist only until one learns  to bear the beams of love   When I from black and he from white cloud free  And round the tent of God like lambs we joy  Ill shade him from the heat till he can bear  To lean in joy upon our fathers knee  And then I ll stand and stroke his silver hair  And be like him and he will then love me   23 8  E9  Blake retained an active interest in social and political events for all his life  and social and political statements are often present in his mystical symbolism  His views on what he saw as oppression and restriction of rightful freedom extended to the Church  His spiritual beliefs are evident in Songs of Experience  1794   in which he distinguishes between the Old Testament God  whose restrictions he rejected  and the New Testament God whom he saw as a positive influence   edit  Visions From a young age  William Blake claimed to have seen visions  The first of these visions may have occurred as early as the age of four when  according to one anecdote  the young artist  saw God  when God  put his head to the window   causing Blake to break into screaming  89  At the age of eight or ten in Peckham Rye  London  Blake claimed to have seen  a tree filled with angels  bright angelic wings bespangling every bough like stars   89  According to Blake s Victorian biographer Gilchrist  he returned home and reported this vision  and he only escaped being thrashed by his father for telling a lie through the intervention of his mother  Though all evidence suggests that his parents were largely supportive  his mother seems to have been especially so  and several of Blake s early drawings and poems decorated the walls of her chamber  On another occasion  Blake watched haymakers at work  and thought he saw angelic figures walking among them  89  The Ghost of a Flea  1819 1820  Having informed painter astrologer John Varley of his visions of apparitions  Blake was subsequently persuaded to paint one of them  90  Varley s anecdote of Blake and his vision of the flea s ghost became well known  90  Blake claimed to experience visions throughout his life  They were often associated with beautiful religious themes and imagery  and therefore may have inspired him further with spiritual works and pursuits  Certainly  religious concepts and imagery figure centrally in Blake s works  God and Christianity constituted the intellectual centre of his writings  from which he drew inspiration  In addition  Blake believed that he was personally instructed and encouraged by Archangels to create his artistic works  which he claimed were actively read and enjoyed by those same Archangels  In a letter of condolence to William Hayley  dated 6 May 1800  four days after the death of Hayley s son  91  Blake writes  I know that our deceased friends are more really with us than when they were apparent to our mortal part  Thirteen years ago I lost a brother  and with his spirit I converse daily and hourly in the spirit  and see him in my remembrance  in the region of my imagination  I hear his advice  and even now write from his dictate  In a letter to John Flaxman  dated 21 September 1800  Blake writes   The town of  Felpham is a sweet place for Study  because it is more spiritual than London  Heaven opens here on all sides her golden Gates  her windows are not obstructed by vapours  voices of Celestial inhabitants are more distinctly heard   amp  their forms more distinctly seen   amp  my Cottage is also a Shadow of their houses  My Wife  amp  Sister are both well  courting Neptune for an embrace    I am more famed in Heaven for my works than I could well conceive  In my Brain are studies  amp  Chambers filled with books  amp  pictures of old  which I wrote  amp  painted in ages of Eternity before my mortal life   amp  those works are the delight  amp  Study of Archangels   E710  In a letter to Thomas Butts  dated 25 April 1803  Blake writes  Now I may say to you  what perhaps I should not dare to say to anyone else  That I can alone carry on my visionary studies in London unannoy d   amp  that I may converse with my friends in Eternity  See Visions  Dream Dreams  amp  prophecy  amp  speak Parables unobserv d  amp  at liberty from the Doubts of other Mortals  perhaps Doubts proceeding from Kindness  but Doubts are always pernicious  Especially when we Doubt our Friends  In A Vision of the Last Judgement Blake writes  Error is Created Truth is Eternal Error or Creation will be Burned Up  amp  then  amp  not till then Truth or Eternity will appear It is Burnt up the Moment Men cease to behold it I assert for My self that I do not behold the Outward Creation  amp  that to me it is hindrance  amp  not Action it is as the Dirt upon my feet No part of Me  What it will be Questiond When the Sun rises do you not see a round Disk of fire somewhat like a Guinea O no no I see an Innumerable company of the Heavenly host crying Holy Holy Holy is the Lord God Almighty I question not my Corporeal or Vegetative Eye any more than I would Question a Window concerning a Sight I look thro it  amp  not with it   E565 6  Aware of Blake s visions  William Wordsworth commented   There was no doubt that this poor man was mad  but there is something in the madness of this man which interests me more than the sanity of Lord Byron and Walter Scott   92  In a more deferential vein  writing in his A short biographical dictionary of English literature  John William Cousins wrote that Blake was  a truly pious and loving soul  neglected and misunderstood by the world  but appreciated by an elect few   who  led a cheerful and contented life of poverty illumined by visions and celestial inspirations   93   edit  Bibliography  edit  Illuminated books c 1788  All Religions are One There is No Natural Religion 1789  Songs of Innocence The Book of Thel
