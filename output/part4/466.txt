British Overseas Territories From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search British Overseas Territories British Overseas Territories  red   the United Kingdom  green   and Crown Dependencies  blue  The British Overseas Territories are fourteen territories of the United Kingdom that  although they do not form part of the United Kingdom itself  fall under its jurisdiction  1  They are remnants of the British Empire that have not acquired independence or have voted to remain British territories  The name  British Overseas Territory  was introduced by the British Overseas Territories Act 2002  and replaced the name British Dependent Territory  which was introduced by the British Nationality Act 1981  Before 1981  the territories were known as Crown colonies  Apart from the British Antarctic Territory  which contains only research stations  and the Sovereign Base Areas on Cyprus and the British Indian Ocean Territory  which are military bases  the overseas territories all have permanent populations  Collectively they encompass an approximate land area of 667 018 square miles  1 727 570 km2   of which the vast majority  660 000 square miles  is British Antarctic Territory  and a population of approximately 260 000 people  2  3  The British Antarctic Territory is part of a mutual recognition agreement with 4 other sovereign nations and their

edit  History Main article  British Empire The original English colonies in the New World were plantations of English subjects in lands hitherto outside the dominions of the Crown  The first such plantation was in Newfoundland  where English fishermen routinely set up seasonal camps in the 16th century  29  The colonisation of North America by England began in 1607 with the settlement of Jamestown  the first successful permanent colony in  Virginia   a term that was then applied generally to North America   Its off shoot  Bermuda  was settled inadvertantly in 1609  with the Virginia Company s charter extended to officially include the archipelago in 1612  St  George s town  founded in Bermuda in that year  remains the oldest continuously inhabited English settlement in the New World  with some historians stating that   its formation predating the 1619 conversion of  James Fort  into  Jamestown    St  George s was actually the first successful town the English established in the New World   Bermuda and Bermudians have played important  sometimes pivotal  but generally underestimated or unacknowledged roles in the shaping of the English and British trans Atlantic Empires  These include maritime commerce  settlement of the continent and of the West Indies  and the projection of naval power via the colony s privateers  among other areas  30  31  The growth of the British Empire in the 19th century  to its territorial peak in the 1920s  saw Britain acquire over one quarter of the world s land mass  including territories with large indigenous populations in Asia and Africa  The late nineteenth century and early twentieth centuries saw the larger settler colonies   in Canada  Australia  New Zealand and South Africa   becoming self governing colonies and achieving independence in all matters except foreign policy  defence and trade  Separate self governing colonies federated to become Canada  in 1867  and Australia  in 1901   These and other large self governing colonies had become known as Dominions by the 1920s  The Dominions achieved almost full independence with the Statute of Westminster  1931   During the second half of the twentieth century most of the British colonies in Africa  Asia and the Caribbean were granted independence  Some colonies became Commonwealth Realms  retaining the British monarch as head of state  citation needed  St  George s town  in the Islands of Bermuda  or  The Somers Isles   The colony was founded by the wrecking of the flagship of the Virginia Company in 1609  The Company s charter was extended to include Bermuda in 1612  and it has remained an English  since 1707  British  colony ever since  Since the independence of Virginia  it has been the oldest remaining British colony  and the town of St  George s is the oldest continuously inhabited English settlement in the New World  32  After the independence of Southern Rhodesia  now Zimbabwe  in Africa in 1980 and British Honduras  now Belize  in Central America in 1981  the last major colony that remained was Hong Kong  with a population of over 5 million  citation needed  With 1997 approaching  the United Kingdom and China negotiated the Sino British Joint Declaration  which led to the whole of Hong Kong becoming a  special administrative region  of China in 1997  subject to various conditions intended to guarantee the preservation of Hong Kong s capitalist economy and its way of life under British rule for at least 50 years after the handover  citation needed  Following the return of Hong Kong  the remaining British overseas possessions are mostly small island territories with small populations   the only territory of significant area being the uninhabited British Antarctic Territory  In 2002  the British Parliament passed the British Overseas Territories Act 2002  This reclassified the UK s dependent territories as overseas territories and  with the exception of those people solely connected with the Sovereign Base Areas of Cyprus  restored full British citizenship to their inhabitants  33   edit  Government  edit  Head of State This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  The head of state in the overseas territories is the British monarch  currently Queen Elizabeth II  The Queen s role in the territories is in her role as Queen of the United Kingdom  and not in right of each territory  The Queen appoints a representative in each territory to exercise her executive power  In territories with a permanent population  a Governor is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the British Government  usually a retired senior military officer  or a senior civil servant  In territories without a permanent population  a Commissioner is usually appointed to represent the Queen  Exceptionally  in the overseas territory of Saint Helena  Ascension and Tristan da Cunha  an Administrator is appointed to be the Governor s representative in each of the two distant parts of the territory  namely Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha  The role of the Governor is to act as the de facto head of state  and they are usually responsible for appointing the head of government  and senior political positions in the territory  The Governor is also responsible for liaising with the UK Government  and carrying out any ceremonial duties  A Commissioner has the same powers as a Governor  but also acts as the head of government  v t e Governors  Civil Commissioners and Administrators of British dependencies Overseas territories Governor of Anguilla   Governor of Bermuda

of Dependent Commonwealth Territories  amp  UK constituent countries All the overseas territories have their own system of government  and localised laws  The structure of the government appears to be closely correlated to the size and political development of the territory  citation needed  Territories Government British Antarctic Territory South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands No native or permanent population  therefore there is no elected government  The Commissioner  supported by an Administrator run the affairs of the territory  British Indian Ocean Territory There is no elected government  and currently has no native settled population  However  the Chagos Islanders   who were forcibly evicted from the territory in 1971   are currently defending an appeal against an English High Court judgment which quashed an Order in Council preventing them from returning  Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia There is no elected government  however the British military authorities try to ensure convergence of laws with those of the Republic of Cyprus where possible  Pitcairn Islands There is an elected Mayor and Island Council  who have the power to propose and administer local legislation  However  their decisions are subject to approval by the Governor  who retains near unlimited powers of plenary legislation on behalf of the United Kingdom Government

deals mostly with foreign affairs and economic issues  while the elected government controls most  domestic  concerns  citation needed  Gibraltar Under the Gibraltar Constitution Order 2006 which was approved in Gibraltar by a referendum  Gibraltar now has a Parliament  The Government of Gibraltar  headed by the Chief Minister is elected  Defence  external affairs and internal security vest in the Governor as a matter of distribution of powers  36  Bermuda Turks and Caicos Islands  Bermuda  settled in 1609  is the oldest and most populous of the Overseas Territories  The bi cameral Parliament consists of a Senate and a House of Assembly  and most executive powers have been devolved to the head of government  known as the Premier  citation needed The Turks and Caicos Islands adopted a new constitution effective 9 August 2006  their head of government now also has the title Premier  their legislature is called the House of Assembly  and their autonomy has been greatly increased  citation needed    On 16 March 2009 the British parliament voted to suspend self government in the territory for a period of up to 2 years  A subsequent legal judgement was upheld by three member British Court of Appeal on 12 August 2009  thus allowing the process to be implemented  37  38   edit  Legal system Each overseas territory has its own legal system independent of the United Kingdom  The legal system is generally based on English common law  with some distinctions for local circumstances  Each territory has its own attorney general  and court system  For the smaller territories  the UK may appoint a UK based lawyer or judge to work on legal cases  This is particularly important for cases involving serious crimes and where it is impossible to find a jury who will not know the defendant in a small population island  citation needed  The Pitcairn rape trial of 2004 is an example of how the UK may choose to provide the legal framework for particular cases where the territory cannot do so alone   edit  Relations with the United Kingdom The Foreign and Commonwealth Office  FCO  has the responsibility of looking after the interests of all overseas territories except the Sovereign Base Areas territory  which comes under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defence  39  40  Within the FCO  the general responsibility for the territories is handled by the Overseas Territories Directorate  41  which is headed by the Minister for the Overseas Territories  As of September 2011 update  the Minister is Henry Bellingham  a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State  42  In 1999  the FCO published the Partnership for Progress and Prosperity  Britain and the Overseas Territories report which set out Britain s policy for the Overseas Territories  covering four main areas  43  dead link  Self determination Responsibilities of Britain and the territories Democratic autonomy Provision for help and assistance Britain and the overseas territories do not have diplomatic representations  although the governments of the overseas territories with indigenous populations all retain a representative office in London  The United Kingdom Overseas Territories Association  UKOTA  also represents the interests of the territories in London  The governments in both London and territories occasionally meet to mitigate or resolve disagreements over the process of governance in the territories and levels of autonomy  44  dead link  Britain provides financial assistance to the overseas territories via the Department for International Development  Currently when   only Montserrat and Saint Helena receive budgetary aid  i e  financial contribution to recurrent funding   citation needed  Several specialist funds are made available by the UK  including  The Good Government Fund which provides assistance on government administration  The Economic Diversification Programme Budget which aim to diversify and enhance the economic bases of the territories

Management Agency  and the Association of Caribbean States  The territories are members of the Commonwealth of Nations through the United Kingdom  The inhabited territories compete in their own right at the Commonwealth Games  and three of the territories  Bermuda  the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands  sent teams to the 2008 Summer Olympics  Gibraltar is the only overseas territory that is part of the European Union  EU   although it is not part of the customs union and is not a member in its own right  None of the other Overseas Territories are members of the EU  and the main body of EU law does not apply and  although certain slices of EU law are applied to those territories as part of the EU s Association of Overseas Countries and Territories  OCT Association   they are not commonly enforceable in local courts  The OCT Association also provides overseas territories with structural funding for regeneration projects  Since the return of full British citizenship 45  to most  belongers  of overseas territories  mainly since the British Overseas Territories Act 2002   the citizens of those territories hold concurrent European Union citizenship  giving them rights of free movement across all EU member states  Several nations dispute the UK s sovereignty in the following overseas territories  British Antarctic Territory   Territory overlaps Antarctic claims made by Chile and Argentina British Indian Ocean Territory   claimed by Mauritius and Seychelles Falkland Islands   claimed by Argentina Gibraltar   claimed by Spain South Georgia and the South Sandwich

own nationality status  and all citizens are classed as British Overseas Territories citizens  BOTC   They do however  have legislative independence over immigration  and holding the status of a BOTC does not automatically give a person a right to abode in any of the territories  as it depends on the territory s immigration laws  A territory may issue Belonger status to allow a person classed as a BOTC to reside in the territory that they have close links with  Non BOTC citizens may acquire Belonger status in order to reside in a particular territory  and may subsequently become naturalised BOTC if they wish   Historically  most inhabitants of the British Empire held the status of British subject  which was usually lost upon independence  From 1949  British subjects in the United Kingdom and the remaining colonies became citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies  However changes in British immigration and nationality law between 1962 and 1983 saw the creation of a separate British Dependent Territories citizenship with effect from January  1983  Citizens in most territories were stripped of full British citizenship  This was mainly to prevent a mass exodus of the citizens of Hong Kong to the UK before the agreed handover to China in 1997  Exception was made for the Falkland Islands  which had been invaded in 1982 by Argentina  Full British citizenship was soon returned to the people of Gibraltar due to their friction with Spain  However  the British Overseas Territories Act 2002 replaced dependent territory citizenship with British Overseas Territories citizenship  and restored full British citizenship to all BOTCs except those from the Sovereign Base Areas of Cyprus  This restored to BOTCs the right to reside in the UK  British citizens however  do not have an automatic right to reside in any of the Overseas Territories  Some territories prohibit immigration  and any visitors are required to seek the permission of the territory s government to live in the territory  As they are used primarily as military bases  Ascension Island and the British Indian Ocean Territory do not allow visitors to the territory unless on official business   edit  Military Defence of the Overseas Territories is the responsibility of the UK  Many of the overseas territories are used as military bases by the UK and its allies  Ascension Island  part of Saint Helena  Ascension and Tristan da Cunha    the Base known as RAF Ascension Island is used by both the Royal Air Force and the United States Air Force  Bermuda   became the primary Royal Navy base in the Western Hemisphere  following US independence  The Naval establishment included an admiralty  a dockyard  and a naval squadron  A considerable military garrison was built up to protect it  and Bermuda

by the British monarch  Traditionally  the flags follow the Blue Ensign design  with the Union Flag in the canton  and the territory s coat of arms in the fly  Exceptions to this are Bermuda which uses a Red Ensign  British Antarctic Territory which uses a White Ensign  British Indian Ocean Territory which uses a Blue Ensign with wavy lines to symbolise the sea  and Gibraltar which uses a banner of its coat of arms  the flag of the city of Gibraltar   The Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia are the only British overseas territories without an official flag of their own  The Union Flag is used in this territory and is also used for Ascension Island   edit  Further reading Harry Ritchie  The Last Pink Bits  Travels Through the Remnants of the British Empire  London  Hodder
