culturally related groups of Native Americans in the United States originally from the Southwest United States  These indigenous peoples of North America speak a Southern Athabaskan  Apachean  language  which is related linguistically to the languages of Athabaskan speakers of Alaska and western Canada  The modern term Apache excludes the related Navajo people  Since the Navajo and the other Apache groups are clearly related through culture and language  they are all considered Apachean  Apachean peoples formerly ranged over eastern Arizona  northern Mexico  New Mexico  west and southwest Texas and southern Colorado  The Apacher a  consisted of high mountains  sheltered and watered valleys  deep canyons  deserts and the southern Great Plains  The Apachean groups had little political unity  the major groups spoke seven different languages and developed distinct and competitive cultures  The current division of Apachean groups includes the Navajo  Western Apache  Chiricahua  Mescalero  Jicarilla  Lipan  and Plains Apache  formerly Kiowa Apache   Apache groups live in Oklahoma and Texas and on reservations in Arizona and New Mexico  Some Apacheans have moved to large metropolitan areas  The largest Apache urban communities are in Oklahoma City  Kansas City  Phoenix  Denver  San Diego and Los Angeles  citation needed  Some Apacheans were employed in migrant farm labor and relocated to the central agricultural regions of Southern California  such as the Coachella  Imperial and Colorado River valleys  where now tens of thousands of Apacheans live  citation needed  The Apachean tribes were historically very powerful  opposing the Spanish and Mexican peoples for centuries  The first Apache raids on Sonora appear to have taken place during the late 17th century  In 19th century confrontations  the U S  Army found the Apache to be fierce warriors and skillful strategists  2  Contents 1 Contemporary Apache groups 2 Name and synonyms 2 1 Difficulties in

is uncertain  Most Apacheans prefer to call themselves Inde  their autonym  meaning  Apache  person  in their language of Mescalero  The first known written record in Spanish is by Juan de O ate in 1598  The most widely accepted origin theory suggests Apache was borrowed and transliterated from the Zuni word  a pa u meaning  Navajos   the plural of pa u  Navajo    7  Another theory suggests the term comes from Yavapai  pa   meaning  enemy   8  The Zuni and Yavapai sources are less certain because O ate used the term before he had encountered any Zuni or Yavapai  9  A less likely origin may be from Spanish mapache  meaning  raccoon   9  The Spanish first used the term  Apachu de Nabajo   Navajo  in the 1620s  referring to people in the Chama region east of the San Juan River  By the 1640s  they applied the term to southern Athabaskan peoples from the Chama on the east to the San Juan on the west  The fame of the tribes  tenacity and fighting skills  probably bolstered by dime novels  was widely known among Europeans  In early 20th century Parisian society  the word Apache was adopted into French  essentially meaning an outlaw   edit  Difficulties in naming Essa queta  Plains Apache chief Many of the historical names of Apache groups that were recorded by non Apache are difficult to match to modern day tribes or their subgroups  Over the centuries  many Spanish  French and or English speaking authors did not differentiate between Apache and other seminomadic non Apache peoples who might pass through the same area  Most commonly  Europeans learned to identify the tribes by translating their exonym  what another group whom the Europeans encountered first called the Apachean peoples  Europeans often did not learn what the peoples called themselves  their autonyms  While anthropologists agree on some traditional major subgrouping of Apaches  they have often used different criteria to name finer divisions  and these do not always match modern Apache groupings  Some scholars do not consider groups residing in what is now Mexico to be Apache  In addition  an Apache individual has different ways of identification with a group  such as a band or clan  as well as the larger tribe or language grouping  which can add to the difficulties in an outsider comprehending the distinctions  In 1900  the U S  government classified the members of the Apache tribe in the United States as Pinal Coyotero  Jicarilla  Mescalero  San Carlos  Tonto  and White Mountain Apache  The different groups were located in Arizona  New Mexico  and Oklahoma  In the 1930s  the anthropologist Grenville Goodwin classified the Western Apache into five groups  based on his informants  views of dialect and cultural differences   White Mountain  Cibecue  San Carlos  North Tonto  and South Tonto  Since then  other anthropologists  e g  Albert Schroeder  consider Goodwin s classification inconsistent with pre reservation cultural divisions  Willem de Reuse finds linguistic evidence supporting only three major groupings  White Mountain  San Carlos  and Dilzhe e  Tonto   He believes San Carlos is the most divergent dialect  and that Dilzhe e is a remnant  intermediate member of a dialect continuum that previously spanned from the Western Apache language to the Navajo  John Upton Terrell classifies the Apache into western and eastern groups  In the western group  he includes Toboso  Cholome  Jocome  Sibolo or Cibola  Pelone  Manso  and Kiva or Kofa  He includes Chicame  the earlier term for Hispanized Chicano or New Mexicans of Spanish Hispanic and Apache descent  among them as having definite Apache connections or names which the Spanish associated with the Apache  In a detailed study of New Mexico Catholic Church records  David M  Brugge identifies 15 tribal names which the Spanish used to refer to the Apache  These were drawn from records of about 1000 baptisms from 1704 to 1862   edit  List of names The list below is based on Foster and McCollough  2001   Opler  1983b  1983c  2001   and de Reuse  1983   Apache  current usage generally includes six of the seven major  traditional  Apachean speaking groups  Chiricahua  Jicarilla  Lipan  Mescalero  Plains Apache  and Western Apache  Historically  the term has also been used for Comanches  Mohaves  Hualapais  and Yavapais  Arivaipa  also Aravaipa  is a band of the San Carlos local group of the Western Apache  Schroeder believes the Arivaipa were a separate people in pre reservation times  Arivaipa is a borrowing  via Spanish  from the O odham language  The Arivaipa are known as Ts zhin    Black Rock   in the Western Apache language  Carlana  also Carlanes  is an Apache group in southeastern Colorado on Raton Mesa  In 1726  they had joined with the Cuartelejo and Paloma  and by the 1730s  they were living with the Jicarilla  It has been suggested that either the Llanero band of the modern Jicarilla or James Mooney s D chizh   zhn Jicarilla division are descendants of the Carlana  Cuartelejo  and Paloma  The Carlana as a whole were also called Sierra Blanca  parts of the group were called Lipiyanes or Llaneros  Otherwise  in 1812  the term was used synonymously with Jicarilla  The Flechas de Palo might have been a part of or absorbed by the Carlana  or Cuartelejo   Chiricahua are one of the seven major Apachean groups  ranging in southeastern Arizona  Ch sh   also Tchishi  is a Navajo word meaning  Chiricahua  southern Apaches in general   10  Ch   k an n  also    k  n        k an n  Chokonni  Cho kon nen  Cho K n    Chokonen  refers to the Eastern Chiricahua band identified by Morris Opler  The name is an autonym from the Chiricahua language  Cibecue is one of Goodwin s Western Apache groups  living to the north of the Salt River between the Tonto and White Mountain groups  consisting of Ceder Creek  Carrizo  and Cibecue  proper  bands  Coyotero usually refers to a southern division of the pre reservation White Mountain local group of the Western Apache  But  the name has also been used more widely to refer to the Apache in general  Western Apache  or an Apachean band in the high plains of southern Colorado to Kansas  Faraones  also Paraonez  Pharaones  Taraones  Taracones  Apaches Faraone  is derived from Spanish Fara n  Pharaoh   Before 1700  the name was vague without a specific referent  Between 1720 and 1726  it referred to the Apache between the Rio Grande in the east  the Pecos River in the west  the area around Santa Fe in the north  and the Conchos River in the south  After 1726  Faraones was used only to refer to the peoples of the north and central parts of this region  The Faraones were probably part of the modern day Mescalero or had merged with the Mescalero  After 1814  the term Faraones disappeared and was replaced by Mescalero  Gile o  also Apaches de Gila  Apaches de Xila  Apaches de la Sierra de Gila  Xile os  Gilenas  Gilans  Gilanians  Gila Apache  Gille os  was used to refer to several different Apachean and non Apachean groups at different times  Gila refers to either the Gila River or the Gila Mountains  Some of the Gila Apaches were probably later known as the Mogollon Apaches  a subdivision of the Chiricahua  while others probably coalesced into the Chiricahua proper  But  since the term was used indiscriminately for all Apachean groups west of the Rio Grande  i e  in southeast Arizona and western New Mexico   the reference in historical documents is often unclear  After 1722  Spanish documents start to distinguish between these different groups  in which case Apaches de Gila refers to the Western Apache living along the Gila River  and thus synonymous with Coyotero   United States writers first used the term to refer to the Mimbres  another subdivision of the Chiricahua   Later they used the term to refer to the Coyotero  Mogollon  Tonto  Mimbre o  Pinale o  and Chiricahua  as well as the non Apachean Yavapai  then also known as Garroteros or Yabipais Gile os   The Spanish also used Apaches de Gila to refer to the non Apachean Pima living on the Gila River  whom they sometimes called Pimas Gile os and Pimas Cile os   Jicarilla  from Spanish meaning  little gourd    One of the 7 major Apachean groups  the Jicarilla Apache live in northern New Mexico  southern Colorado  and the Texas Panhandle  Kiowa Apache  See Plains Apache  Llanero is a borrowing from Spanish meaning  plains dweller   The name was historically used to refer to several different groups who hunted buffalo seasonally on the Great Plains  also referenced in eastern New Mexico and western Texas   See also Carlanas   Lipiy nes  also Lipiy n  Lipillanes   An uncertain term  probably of Athabascan origin  that may have been a synonym of Llanero or Natag s  This term is not to be confused with Lipan  Lipan  also Ypandis  Ypandes  Ipandes  Ipandi  Lipanes  Lipanos  Lipaines  Lapane  Lipanis  etc    One of the 7 major Apachean peoples  They once lived in eastern New

newly established town of San Antonio  Texas  Mescalero  The Mescalero are one of the 7 major Apachean groups  generally living in what is now eastern New Mexico and western Texas  Mimbre os is an older name that refers to a section of Opler s Eastern Chiricahua band and to Albert Schroeder s Mimbres and Warm Springs Chiricahua bands 11  in southwestern New Mexico  Mogollon was considered by Schroeder to be a separate pre reservation Chiricahua band  while Opler considered the Mogollon to be part of his Eastern Chiricahua band in New Mexico  N    sha  also N   sha  Na isha  Na ishandine

to have consisted of the Mescalero  around El Paso and the Organ Mountains  and the Salinero  around Rio Salado   but these were probably the same group  After 1749  the term was used synonymously with Mescalero  which eventually replaced it  Navajo  The most numerous of the 7 major Apachean speaking groups  General modern usage separates the Navajo people culturally from the Apache  Pinal  also Pinale os   One of the bands of the Goodwin s San Carlos group of Western Apache  Also used along with Coyotero to refer more generally to one of two major Western Apache divisions  Some Pinale o were referred to as the Gila Apache  Plains Apache  The Plains Apache  also called Kiowa Apache  Naisha  Na ishandine  are one of the 7 major Apachean groups  generally living in what is now Oklahoma  In historic times  they were found living among the  unrelated  Kiowa  The term has also been used to refer to any supposed Apachean tribe found on or associated  usually culturally  with the North American Plains  Ramah  A group of Navajos currently living in the Ramah Navajo Indian Reservation in New Mexico   The Navajo name for Ramah  New Mexico is T  ohchin  meaning  wild onion place    Querechos referred to by Coronado in 1541  possibly Plains Apaches  at times maybe Navajo  Other early Spanish might have also called them Vaquereo or Llanero  San Carlos  A Western Apache group that ranged closest to Tucson according to Goodwin  This group consisted of the Apache Peaks  Arivaipa  Pinal  San Carlos  proper  bands  Tonto  Goodwin divided into Northern Tonto and Southern Tonto groups  living in the north and west areas of the Western Apache groups according to Goodwin  This is north of Phoenix  north of the Verde River  Schroeder has suggested that the Tonto are originally Yavapais who assimilated Western Apache culture  Tonto is one of the major dialects of the Western Apache language  Tonto Apache speakers are traditionally bilingual in Western Apache and Yavapai  Goodwin s Northern Tonto consisted of Bald Mountain  Fossil Creek  Mormon Lake  and Oak Creek bands  Southern Tonto consisted of the Mazatzal band and unidentified  semi bands   Warm Springs were located on upper reaches of Gila River  New Mexico   See also Gile o and Mimbre os   Western Apache  In the most common sense  includes Northern Tonto  Southern Tonto  Cibecue  White Mountain and San Carlos groups  While these subgroups spoke the same language and had kinship ties  Western Apaches considered themselves as separate from each other  according to Goodwin  Other writers have used this term to refer to all non Navajo Apachean peoples living west of the Rio Grande  thus failing to distinguish the Chiricahua from the other Apacheans   Goodwin s formulation   all those Apache peoples who have lived within the present boundaries of the state of Arizona during historic times with the exception of the Chiricahua  Warm Springs  and allied Apache  and a small band of Apaches known as the Apache Mansos  who lived in the vicinity of Tucson   12  White Mountain  The easternmost group of the Western Apache according to Goodwin  Consisted of Eastern White Mountain and Western White Mountain   edit  History  edit  Entry into the Southwest The Apache and Navajo tribal groups of the North American Southwest speak related languages of the Athabaskan language family  Other Athabaskan speaking people in North America reside in a northern range from Alaska through west central Canada  and some groups are found along the Northwest Pacific Coast  Linguistic similarities indicate the Navajo and Apache were once a single ethnic group  Archaeological and historical evidence seems to suggest the Southern Athabaskan entry into the American Southwest was sometime after 1000 AD  Their nomadic way of life complicates accurate dating  primarily because they constructed less substantial dwellings than other Southwestern groups  13  Since the early twenty first century  substantial progress has been made in dating and distinguishing their dwellings and other forms of material culture  14  They left behind a more austere set of tools and material goods than other Southwestern cultures  The Athabaskan speaking group probably moved into areas that were concurrently occupied or recently abandoned by other cultures  Other Athabaskan speakers  perhaps including the Southern Athabaskan  adapted many of their neighbors  technology and practices in their own cultures  Thus sites where early Southern Athabaskans may have lived are difficult to locate and even more difficult to firmly identify as culturally Southern Athabaskan  Recent advances have been made in the regard in the far southern portion of the American Southwest  There are several hypotheses concerning Apachean migrations  One posits that they moved into the Southwest from the Great Plains  In the early 16th century  these mobile groups lived in tents  hunted bison and other game  and used dogs to pull travois loaded with their possessions  Substantial numbers of the people and a wide range were recorded by the Spanish in the 16th century  The Coronado Expedition 1540 1542 In April 1541  while traveling on the plains east of the Pueblo region  Francisco Coronado referred to the people  dog nomads   He wrote   After seventeen days of travel  I came upon a  rancheria  of the Indians who follow these cattle  bison   These natives are called Querechos  They do not cultivate the land  but eat raw meat and drink the blood of the cattle they kill  They dress in the skins of the cattle  with which all the people in this land clothe themselves  and they have very well constructed tents  made with tanned and greased cowhides  in which they live and which they take along as they follow the cattle  They have dogs which they load to carry their tents  poles  and belongings   15  The Spanish described Plains dogs as very white  with black spots  and  not much larger than water spaniels   16  Plains dogs were slightly smaller than those used for hauling loads by modern Inuit and northern First Nations people in Canada  Recent experiments show these dogs may have pulled loads up to 50 lb  20 kg  on long trips  at rates as high as two or three miles per hour  3 to 5 km h   16  The Plains migration theory associates the Apachean peoples with the Dismal River culture  an archaeological culture known primarily from ceramics and house remains  dated 1675 1725  which has been excavated in Nebraska  eastern Colorado  and western Kansas  Although the first documentary sources mention the Apache  and historians have suggested some passages indicate a 16th century entry from the north  archaeological data indicate they were present on the plains long before this first reported contact  A competing theory posits their migration south  through the Rocky Mountains  ultimately reaching the American Southwest by the 14th century or perhaps earlier  An archaeological material culture assemblage identified in this mountainous zone as ancestral Apachean has been referred to as the  Cerro Rojo complex   17  This theory does not preclude arrival via a plains route as well  perhaps concurrently  but to date the earliest evidence has been found in the mountainous Southwest  Only the Plains Apache have any significant Plains cultural influence  while all tribes have distinct Athabaskan characteristics  The descriptions of peoples such as the Mountain Querecho and the Apache Vaquero are vague and could apply to many other Plains tribes  The specific traits of these groups do not seem particularly Apachean  Additionally  Harry Hoijer s classification of Plains Apache as an Apachean language has been disputed  When the Spanish arrived in the area  trade between the long established Pueblo peoples and the Southern Athabaskan was well established  They reported the Pueblo exchanged maize and woven cotton goods for bison meat  and hides and materials for stone tools  Coronado observed the Plains people wintering near the Pueblo in established camps  Later Spanish sovereignty over the area disrupted trade between the Pueblo and the diverging Apache and Navajo groups  The Apache quickly acquired horses  improving their mobility for quick raids on settlements  In addition  the Pueblo were forced to work Spanish mission lands and care for mission flocks  they had fewer surplus goods to trade with their neighbors  18  In 1540 Coronado reported that the modern Western Apache area was uninhabited  although some scholars have argued that he simply did not see the American Indians  Other Spanish explorers first mention  Querechos  living west of the Rio Grande in the 1580s  To some historians  this implies the Apaches moved into their current Southwestern homelands in the late 16th and early 17th centuries  Other historians note that Coronado reported that Pueblo women and children had often been evacuated by the time his party attacked their dwellings  and that he saw some dwellings had been recently abandoned as he moved up the Rio Grande  This might indicate the semi nomadic Southern Athabaskan had advance warning about his hostile approach and evaded encounter with the Spanish  Archaeologists are finding ample evidence of an early proto Apache presence in the Southwestern mountain zone in the 15th century and perhaps earlier  The Apache presence on both the Plains and in the mountainous Southwest indicate that the people took multiple early migration routes   edit  Conflict with Mexico and the United States Further information  Apache Wars In general  the recently arrived Spanish colonists  who settled in villages  and Apache bands developed a pattern of interaction over a few centuries  Both raided and traded with each other  Records of the period seem to indicate that relationships depended upon the specific villages and specific bands that were involved with each other  For example  one band might be friends with one village and raid another  When war happened between the two  the Spanish would send troops  after a battle both sides would  sign a treaty   and both sides would go home  The traditional and sometimes treacherous relationships continued between the villages and bands with the independence of Mexico in 1821  By 1835 Mexico had placed a bounty on Apache scalps  see scalping  but certain villages were still trading with some bands  When Juan Jos  Compas  the leader of the Mimbre o Apaches  was killed for bounty money in 1837  Mangas Coloradas or Dasoda hae  Red Sleeves  became the principal chief and war leader  He conducted a series of retaliatory raids against the Mexicans  By 1856  authorities in horse rich Durango would claim that Indian raids  mostly Comanche and Apache  in their state had taken nearly 6 000 lives  abducted 748 people  and forced the abandonment of 358 settlements over the previous 20 years  19  Geronimo When the United States went to war against Mexico in 1846  many Apache bands promised U S  soldiers safe passage through their lands  When the U S  claimed former territories of Mexico in 1846  Mangas Coloradas signed a peace treaty with the nation  respecting them as conquerors of the Mexicans  land  An uneasy peace  a centuries old tradition  between the Apache and the new citizens of the United States held until the 1850s  An influx of gold miners into the Santa Rita Mountains led to conflict with the Apache  This period is sometimes called the Apache Wars  The United States  concept of a reservation had not been used by the Spanish  Mexicans or other Apache neighbors before  Reservations were often badly managed  and bands that had no kinship relationships were forced to live together  No fences existed to keep people in or out  It was not uncommon for a band to be given permission to leave for a short period of time  Other times a band would leave without permission  to raid  return to their homeland to forage  or to simply get away  The military usually had forts nearby  Their job was keeping the various bands on the reservations by finding and returning those who left  The reservation policies of the United States produced conflict and war with the various Apache bands who left the reservations for almost another quarter century  The warfare between the Apachean peoples and Euro Americans has led to a stereotypical focus on certain aspects of Apachean cultures  These have often been distorted through misunderstanding of their cultures  as noted by anthropologist Keith Basso   Of the hundreds of peoples that lived and flourished in native North America  few have been so consistently misrepresented as the Apacheans of Arizona and New Mexico  Glorified by novelists  sensationalized by historians  and distorted beyond credulity by commercial film makers  the popular image of  the Apache    a brutish  terrifying semi human bent upon wanton death and destruction   is almost entirely a product of irresponsible caricature and exaggeration  Indeed  there can be little doubt that the Apache has been transformed from a native American into an American legend  the fanciful and fallacious creation of a non Indian citizenry whose inability to recognize the massive treachery of ethnic and cultural stereotypes has been matched only by its willingness to sustain and inflate them   20   edit  Forced removal In 1875  United States military forced the removal of an estimated 1 500 Yavapai and Dilzhe e Apache  better known as Tonto Apache  from the Rio Verde Indian Reserve and its several thousand acres of treaty lands promised to them by the United States government  At the orders of the Indian Commissioner  L E  Dudley  U S  Army troops made the people  young and old  walk through winter flooded rivers  mountain passes and narrow canyon trails to get to the Indian Agency at San Carlos  180 miles  290 km  away  The trek resulted in the loss of several hundred lives  The peoples were held there in internment for 25 years while white settlers took over their land  Only a few hundred ever returned to their lands   edit  Defeat Most United States  histories of this era report that the final defeat of an Apache band took place when 5 000 US troops forced Geronimo s group of 30 to 50 men  women and children to surrender on September 4  1886 at Skeleton Canyon  Arizona  21  The Army sent this band and the Chiricahua scouts who had tracked them to military confinement in Florida at Fort Pickens and  subsequently  Ft  Sill  Oklahoma  Many books were written on the stories of hunting and trapping during the late 19th century  Many of these stories involve Apache raids and the failure of agreements with Americans and Mexicans  In the post war era  the US government arranged for Apache children to be taken from their families for adoption by white Americans in assimilation programs  citation needed  These were similar in nature to those involving the Stolen Generations of Australia   edit  Pre reservation culture  edit  Social organization Apache bride All Apachean peoples lived in extended family units  or family clusters   they usually lived close together  with each nuclear family in separate dwellings  An extended family generally consisted of a husband and wife  their unmarried children  their married daughters  their married daughters  husbands  and their married daughters  children  Thus  the extended family is connected through a lineage of women who live together  that is  matrilocal residence   into which men may enter upon marriage  leaving behind his parents  family   When a daughter was married  a new dwelling was built nearby for her and her husband  Among the Navajo  residence rights are ultimately derived from a head mother  Although the Western Apache usually practiced matrilocal residence  sometimes the eldest son chose to bring his wife to live with his parents after marriage  All tribes practiced sororate and levirate marriages  All Apachean men practiced varying degrees of  avoidance  of his wife s close relatives  a practice often most strictly observed by distance between mother in law and son in law  The degree of avoidance differed in different Apachean groups  The most elaborate system was among the Chiricahua  where men had to use indirect polite speech toward and were not allowed to be within visual sight of the wife s female relatives  whom he had to avoid  His female Chiricahua relatives through marriage also avoided him  Several extended families worked together as a  local group   which carried out certain ceremonies  and economic and military activities  Political control was mostly present at the local group level  Local groups were headed by a chief  a male who had considerable influence over others in the group due to his effectiveness and reputation  The chief was the closest societal role to a leader in Apachean cultures  The office was not hereditary  and the position was often filled by members of different extended families  The chief s leadership was only as strong as he was evaluated to be no group member was ever obliged to follow the chief  The Western Apache criteria for evaluating a good chief included  industriousness  generosity  impartiality  forbearance  conscientiousness  and eloquence in language  Many Apachean peoples joined together several local groups into  bands   Band organization was strongest among the Chiricahua and Western Apache  while among the Lipan and Mescalero  it was weak  The Navajo did not organize local groups into bands  perhaps because of the requirements of the sheepherding economy  However  the Navajo did have  the outfit   a group of relatives that was larger than the extended family  but not as large as a local group community or a band  On the larger level  the Western Apache organized bands into what Grenville Goodwin called  groups   He reported five groups for the Western Apache  Northern Tonto  Southern Tonto  Cibecue  San Carlos  and White Mountain  The Jicarilla grouped their bands into  moieties   perhaps influenced by the example of the northeastern Pueblo  The Western Apache and Navajo also had a system of matrilineal  clans  that were organized further into phratries  perhaps influenced by the western Pueblo   The notion of  tribe  in Apachean cultures is very weakly developed  essentially it was only a recognition  that one owed a modicum of hospitality to those of the same speech  dress  and customs   22  The seven Apachean tribes had no political unity  despite such portrayals in common perception  23  and often were enemies of each other for example  the Lipan fought against the Mescalero just as they did against the Comanche   edit  Kinship systems The Apachean tribes have two distinctly different kinship term systems  a Chiricahua type and a Jicarilla type  24  The Chiricahua type system is used by the Chiricahua  Mescalero  and Western Apache  The Western Apache system differs slightly from the other two systems  and it has some similarities to the Navajo system  The Jicarilla type  which is similar to the Dakota Iroquois kinship systems  is used by the Jicarilla  Navajo  Lipan  and Plains Apache  The Navajo system is more divergent among the four  having similarities with the Chiricahua type system  The Lipan and Plains Apache systems are very similar   edit  Chiricahua Hide painting depicting Apache girl s puberty ceremony  by Naiche  Chiricahua Apache   ca  1900  Oklahoma History Center The Chiricahua language has four different words for grandparent   ch  25   maternal grandmother    ts y   maternal grandfather    ch in   paternal grandmother    n l   paternal grandfather   Additionally  a grandparent s siblings are identified by the same word  thus  one s maternal grandmother  one s maternal grandmother s sisters  and one s maternal grandmother s brothers are all called  ch   Furthermore  the grandparent terms are reciprocal  that is  a grandparent will use the same term to refer to their grandchild in that relationship  For example  a person s maternal grandmother will be called  ch  and that maternal grandmother will also call that person  ch  as well  i e   ch  can mean the child of either your own daughter or your sibling s daughter   Chiricahua cousins are not distinguished from siblings through kinship terms  Thus  the same word will refer to either a sibling or a cousin  there are not separate terms for parallel cousin and cross cousin   Additionally  the terms are used according to the sex of the speaker  unlike the English terms brother and sister    k is  same sex sibling or same sex cousin      l h  opposite sex sibling or opposite sex cousin   This means if one is a male  then one s brother is called  k is and one s sister is called    l h  If one is a female  then one s brother is called    l h and one s sister is called  k is  Chiricahuas in a    l h relationship observed great restraint and respect toward that relative  cousins  but not siblings  in a    l h relationship may practice total avoidance  Two different words are used for each parent according to sex   m     mother    taa  father   Likewise  there are two words for a parent s child according to sex   y ch e   daughter    ghe   son   A parent s siblings are classified

grandparent grandchild terms  Thus   gh y  also refers to one s opposite sex sibling s son or daughter  that is  a person will call their maternal aunt  gh y  and that aunt will call them  gh y  in return    edit  Jicarilla Unlike the Chiricahua system  the Jicarilla have only two terms for grandparents according to sex   ch    grandmother    ts y    grandfather   They do not have separate terms for maternal or paternal grandparents  The terms are also used of a grandparent s siblings according to sex  Thus   ch   refers to one s grandmother or one s grand aunt  either maternal or paternal    ts y   refers to one s grandfather or one s grand uncle  These terms are not reciprocal  There is a single word for grandchild  regardless of sex    ts y      There are two terms for each parent

types of houses  The first of which is the teepee  for those who lived in the plains  Another type of housing is the wickiup  an 8 foot tall  2 4 m  frame of wood held together with yucca fibers and covered in brush usually in the Apache groups in the highlands  If a family member lived in a wickiup and they died  the wickiup would be burned  The final housing is the hogan  an earthen structure in the desert area that was good for cool keeping in the hot weather of northern Mexico  Below is a description of Chiricahua wickiups recorded by anthropologist Morris Opler   The home in which the family lives is made by the women and is ordinarily a circular  dome shaped brush dwelling  with the floor at ground level  It is seven feet high at the center and approximately eight feet in diameter  To build it  long fresh poles of oak or willow are driven into the ground or placed in holes made with a digging stick  These poles  which form the framework  are arranged at one foot intervals and are bound together at the top with yucca leaf strands  Over them a thatching of bundles of big bluestem grass or bear grass is tied  shingle style  with yucca strings  A smoke hole opens above a central fireplace  A hide  suspended at the entrance  is fixed on a cross beam so that it may be swung forward or backward  The doorway may face in any direction  For waterproofing  pieces of hide are thrown over the outer hatching  and in rainy weather  if a fire is not needed  even the smoke hole is covered  In warm  dry weather much of the outer roofing is stripped off  It takes approximately three days to erect a sturdy dwelling of this type  These houses are  warm and comfortable  even though there is a big snow   The interior is lined with brush and grass beds over which robes are spread    Chiricahua medicine man in wickiup with family  The woman not only makes the furnishings of the home but is responsible for the construction  maintenance  and repair of the dwelling itself and for the arrangement of everything in it  She provides the grass and brush beds and replaces them when they become too old and dry     However  formerly  they had no permanent homes  so they didn t bother with cleaning   The dome shaped dwelling or wickiup  the usual home type for all the Chiricahua bands  has already been described     Said a Central Chiricahua informant  Both the tepee and the oval shaped house were used when I was a boy  The oval hut was covered with hide and was the best house  The more well to do had this kind  The tepee type was just made of brush  It had a place for a fire in the center  It was just thrown together  Both types were common even before my time      A house form that departs from the more common dome shaped variety is recorded for the Southern Chiricahua as well     When we settled down  we used the wickiup  when we were moving around a great deal  we used this other kind     26  Recent research has documented the archaeological remains of Chiricahua Apache wickiups as found on protohistoric and at historical sites  such as Canon de los Embudos where C S  Fly photographed Geronimo  his people  and dwellings during surrender negotiations in 1886  demonstrating their unobtrusive and improvised nature   27   edit  Food Various Apache containers  baskets  bowls and jars  The women made baskets could hold heavy loads and were made mainly from yucca or willow leaves or juniper bark  28  Apache people obtained food from four main sources  29  hunting wild animals  gathering wild plants  growing domesticated plants trading with or raiding neighboring tribes for livestock and agricultural products  The Western Apache diet consisted of 35 40  meat and 60 65  plant foods  As the different Apachean tribes lived in different environments  the particular types of foods eaten varied according to their respective environment   edit  Hunting Hunting was done primarily by men  although there were sometimes exceptions depending on animal and culture  e g  Lipan women could help in hunting rabbits and Chiricahua boys were also allowed to hunt rabbits   An Apache jug  Hunting often had elaborate preparations  such as fasting and religious rituals performed by medicine men before and after the hunt  In Lipan culture  since deer were protected by Mountain Spirits  great care was taken in Mountain Spirit rituals in order to ensure smooth deer hunting  Also the slaughter of animals must be performed following certain religious guidelines  many of which are recorded in religious stories  from prescribing how to cut the animals  what prayers to recite  and proper disposal of bones  A common practice among Southern Athabascan hunters was the distribution of successfully slaughtered game  For example  among the Mescalero a hunter was expected to share as much as one half of his kill with a fellow hunter and with needy people back at the camp  Feelings of individuals concerning this practice spoke of social obligation and spontaneous generosity  The most common hunting weapon before the introduction of European guns was the bow and arrow  Various hunting strategies were used  Some techniques involved using animal head masks worn as a disguise  Whistles were sometimes used to lure animals closer  Another technique was the relay method where hunters positioned at various points would chase the prey in turns in order to tire the animal  A similar method involved chasing the prey down a steep cliff  Eating certain animals was taboo  Although different cultures had different taboos  some common examples of taboo animals included bears  peccaries  turkeys  fish  snakes  insects  owls  and coyotes  An example of taboo differences  the black bear was a part of the Lipan diet  although not as common as buffalo  deer  or antelope   but the Jicarilla never ate bear because it was considered an evil animal  Some taboos were a regional phenomena  such as of eating fish  which was taboo throughout the southwest  e g  in certain Pueblo cultures like the Hopi and Zuni  and considered to be snake like  an evil animal  in physical appearance  30  31  The Western Apache hunted deer and pronghorns mostly in the ideal late fall season  After the meat was smoked into jerky around November  a migration from the farm sites along the stream banks in the mountains to winter camps in the Salt  Black  Gila river and even the Colorado River valleys  The primary game of the Chiricahua was the deer followed by pronghorn  Lesser game included  cottontail rabbits  but not jack rabbits   opossums  squirrels  surplus horses  surplus mules  wapiti  elk   wild cattle  wood rats  The Mescalero primarily hunted deer  Other animals hunted include  bighorn sheep  buffalo  for those living closer to the plains   cottontail rabbits  elk  horses  mules  opossums  pronghorn  wild steers and wood rats  Beavers  minks  muskrats  and weasels were also hunted for their hides and body parts but were not eaten  The principal quarry animals of the Jicarilla were bighorn sheep  buffalo  deer  elk and pronghorn  Other game animals included beaver  bighorn sheep  chief hares  chipmunks  doves  ground hogs  grouse  peccaries  porcupines  prairie dogs  quail  rabbits  skunks  snow birds  squirrels  turkeys and wood rats  Burros and horses were only eaten in emergencies  Minks  weasels  wildcats and wolves were not eaten but hunted for their body parts  The main food of the Lipan was the buffalo with a three week hunt during the fall and smaller scale hunts continuing until the spring  The second most utilized animal was deer  Fresh deer blood was drunk for good health  Other animals included beavers  bighorns  black bears  burros  ducks  elk  fish  horses  mountain lions  mourning doves  mules  prairie dogs  pronghorns  quail  rabbits  squirrels  turkeys  turtles and wood rats  Skunks were eaten only in emergencies  Plains Apache hunters pursued primarily buffalo and deer  Other hunted animals were badgers  bears  beavers  fowls  geese  opossums  otters  rabbits and turtles   edit  Clothing Influenced by the Plains Indians  Western Apaches wore animal hide decorated with seed beads for clothing  These beaded designs historically resembled that of the Great Basin Paiute and is characterized by linear patterning  Apache beaded clothing was bordered with narrow bands of glass seed beads in diagonal stripes of alternating colors  32  They made buckskin shirts  ponchos  skirts and moccasins and decorated them with colorful beadwork   edit  Undomesticated plants and other food sources Apache girl with basket  1902 The gathering of plants and other foods was primarily a female chore  However  in certain activities  such as the gathering of heavy agave crowns  men helped  Numerous plants were used for medicine and religious ceremonies in addition their nutritional usage  Other plants were utilized for only their religious or medicinal value  In May  the Western Apache baked and dried agave crowns that were pounded into pulp and formed into rectangular cakes  At the end of June and beginning of July  saguaro  prickly pear  and cholla fruits were gathered  In July and August  mesquite beans  Spanish bayonet fruit  and Emory oak acorns were gathered  In late September  gathering was stopped as attention moved toward harvesting cultivated crops  In late fall  juniper berries and pinyon nuts were gathered  The most important plant food used by the Chiricahua was the Century plant  also known as mescal or agave   The crowns  the tuberous base portion  of this plant  which were baked in large underground ovens and sun dried  and also the shoots were used  Other plants utilized by the Chiricahua include  agarita

within agave  sotol  and narrowleaf yucca plants  The abundant agave  mescal  was also important to the Mescalero  33  who gathered the crowns in late spring after reddish flower stalks appeared  The smaller sotol crowns were also important  Both crowns of both plants were baked and dried  Other plants include  acorns  agarita berries  amole stalks  roasted and peeled   aspen inner bark  used as a

Plants utilized by the Plains Apache include  chokecherries  blackberries  grapes  prairie turnips  wild onions  and wild plums  Numerous other fruits  vegetables  and tuberous roots were also used   edit  Crop cultivation The Navajo practiced the most crop cultivation  the Western Apache  Jicarilla  and Lipan less  The one Chiricahua band  of Opler s  and Mescalero practiced very little cultivation  The other two Chiricahua bands and the Plains Apache did not grow any crops   edit  Trading  raiding and war Some interchanges between the Apache and European descended explorers and settlers were based on trading  The Apache found they could use European and American goods  They also believed in taking what they needed  for instance  horses  Although the following activities were not distinguished by Europeans or Euro Americans  all Apachean tribes made clear distinctions between raiding  for profit  and war  Raiding was done with small parties with a specific economic target  The Apache waged war with large parties  often using clan members   usually to achieve retribution  Though raiding had been a traditional way of life for the Apache  Mexican settlers objected to their stock being stolen  As tensions between the Apache and settlers increased  the Mexican government passed laws offering cash rewards for Apache scalps  34   edit  Religion Apachean religious stories relate two culture heroes  one of the Sun fire  Killer Of Enemies Monster Slayer   and one of Water Moon thunder   Child Of The Water Born For Water   that destroy a number of creatures which are harmful to humankind  35  Another story is of a hidden ball game  where good and evil animals decide whether or not the world should be forever dark  Coyote  the trickster  is an important being that often has inappropriate behavior  such as marrying his own daughter  etc   in which he overturns social convention  The Navajo  Western Apache  Jicarilla  and Lipan have an emergence or Creation Story  while this is lacking in the Chiricahua and Mescalero  35  Most Southern Athabascan  gods  are personified natural forces that run through the universe  They may be used for human purposes through ritual ceremonies  The following is a formulation by the anthropologist Keith Basso of the Western Apache s concept of diy    The term diy   refers to one or all of a set of abstract and invisible forces which are said to derive from certain classes of animals  plants  minerals  meteorological phenomena  and mythological figures within the Western Apache universe  Any of the various powers may be acquired by man and  if properly handled  used for a variety of purposes  36  Medicine men  shamans  learn the ceremonies  which can also be acquired by direct revelation to the individual  see also mysticism   Different Apachean cultures had different views of ceremonial practice  Most Chiricahua and Mescalero ceremonies were learned through the transmission of personal religious visions  while the Jicarilla and Western Apache used standardized rituals as the more central ceremonial practice  Important standardized ceremonies include the puberty ceremony  Sunrise Dance  of young women  Navajo chants  Jicarilla  long life  ceremonies  and Plains Apache  sacred bundle  ceremonies  Certain animals are considered spiritually evil and prone to cause sickness to humans  owls  snakes  bears  and coyotes  Many Apachean ceremonies use masked representations of religious spirits  Sandpainting is an important ceremony in the Navajo  Western Apache  and Jicarilla traditions  in which shamans create temporary  sacred art from colored sands  Anthropologists believe the use of masks and sandpainting are examples of cultural diffusion from neighboring Pueblo cultures  37  The Apaches participate in many spiritual dances  including the rain dance  dances for the crop and harvest  and a spirit dance  These dances were mostly for influencing the weather and enriching their food resources   edit  Languages For more details on this topic  see Southern Athabascan languages  Apachean peoples speak one or more of seven Southern Athabascan languages  which have relatively similar grammatical structures and sound systems  Southern Athabascan  or Apachean  is sub family of the larger Athabascan family  which is a branch of Nadene  Navajo is notable for being the indigenous language of the United States with the largest number of native speakers  However  all Apachean languages are endangered  including Navajo  Lipan is reported extinct  The Southern Athabascan branch was defined by Harry Hoijer primarily according to its merger of stem initial consonants of the Proto Athabascan series  k  and  c into  c  in addition to the widespread merger of    and     into    also found in many Northern Athabascan languages   Proto  Athabascan Navajo Western Apache Chiricahua Mescalero Jicarilla Lipan Plains Apache  k u s  handle fabric like object   tsooz  tsooz  tsuuz  tsuudz  tsoos  tsoos  tsoos  ce   stone  ts  ts   ts  ts  ts  ts  ts   Hoijer  1938  divided the Apachean sub family into an Eastern branch consisting of Jicarilla  Lipan  and Plains Apache and a Western branch consisting of Navajo  Western Apache  San Carlos   Chiricahua  and Mescalero based on the merger of Proto Apachean  t and  k to k in the Eastern branch  Thus  as can be seen in the example below  when the Western languages have noun or verb stems that start with t  the related forms in the Eastern languages will start with a k  Western Eastern Navajo Western Apache Chiricahua Mescalero Jicarilla Lipan Plains Apache  water  t  t  t  t  k  k  k    fire  k   k   k   k  ko   k    k   He later revised his proposal in 1971 when he found that Plains Apache did not participate in the  k   c merger to consider Plains Apache as a language equidistant from the other languages  now called Southwestern Apachean  Thus  some stems that originally started with  k  in Proto Athabascan start with ch in Plains Apache while the other languages start with ts  Proto  Athabascan Navajo Chiricahua Mescalero Jicarilla Plains Apache  k a x    big   tsaa  tsaa  tsaa  tsaa  cha Morris Opler  1975  has suggested that Hoijer s original formulation that Jicarilla and Lipan in an Eastern branch was more in agreement with the cultural similarities between these two and the differences from the other Western Apachean groups  Other linguists  particularly Michael Krauss  1973   have noted that a classification based only on the initial consonants of noun and verb stems is arbitrary and when other sound correspondences are considered the relationships between the languages appear to be more complex  Additionally  it has been pointed out by Martin Huld  1983  that since Plains Apache does not merge Proto Athabascan  k   c  Plains Apache cannot be considered an Apachean language as defined by Hoijer  Apachean languages are tonal languages  Regarding tonal development  all Apachean languages are low marked languages  which means that stems with a  constricted  syllable rime in the proto language developed low tone while all other rimes developed high tone  Other Northern Athabascan languages are high marked languages in which the tonal development is the reverse  In the example below  if low marked Navajo and Chiricahua have a low tone  then the high marked Northern Athabascan languages  Slavey and Chilcotin  have a high tone  and if Navajo and Chiricahua have a high tone  then Slavey and Chilcotin have a low tone  Low Marked High Marked Proto  Athabascan Navajo
