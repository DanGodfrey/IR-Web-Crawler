Reconstruction Era of the United States From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search In the history of the United States  the term Reconstruction Era has two senses  the first covers the entire nation in the period 1865 1877 following the Civil War  the second one  used in this article  covers the transformation of the Southern United States from 1863 to 1877  with the reconstruction of state and society in the former Confederacy  In battles between the president and Congress  the president prevailed until the election of 1866  which enabled the Radical Republicans to take control of policy  remove from power the ex Confederates  and enfranchise the Freedmen  freed slaves   A Republican coalition came to power in the southern states and set out to radically transform the society  with support from the Army and the Freedman s Bureau  Conservative white Democrats  alleging widespread corruption  counterattacked and regained power in each state by 1877  often with violence  The Freedmen became second class citizens  while most Southern whites became embittered toward the North and formed a Democratic  Solid South   The deployment of the U S  military was central to the establishment of Southern Reconstructed state governments and the suppression of violence against black and white voters  1  Reconstruction was a remarkable chapter in the story of American freedom  but most historians consider it a failure because the region became a poverty stricken backwater and the Freedmen in the end were at best second class citizens  Historian Eric Foner argues   What remains certain is that Reconstruction failed  and that for blacks its failure was a disaster whose magnitude cannot be obscured by the genuine accomplishments that did endure   2

Reconstruction policies were debated in the North when the war began  and commenced in earnest after the Emancipation Proclamation  issued on January 1  1863   edit  Overview Reconstruction policies were implemented when a Confederate state came under the control of the Union Army  President Abraham Lincoln set up reconstructed governments in several southern states during the war  including Tennessee  Arkansas  and Louisiana  He experimented with giving land to ex slaves in South Carolina  Following Lincoln s assassination in April 1865  president Andrew Johnson tried to follow Lincoln s policies and appointed new governors in the summer of 1865  Johnson quickly declared that the war goals of national unity and the ending of slavery had been achieved  so that reconstruction was completed  Republicans in Congress refused to accept Johnson s terms  rejected the new members of Congress elected by the South  and in 1865 66 broke with the president  A sweeping Republican victory in the 1866 Congressional elections in the North gave the Radical Republicans enough control of Congress that they overrode Johnson s vetoes and began what is called  Radical Reconstruction  in 1867  4  Congress removed the civilian governments in the South 5  in 1867 and put the former Confederacy under the rule of the U S  Army  The army conducted new elections in which the freed slaves could vote  while whites who held leading positions under the Confederacy were temporarily denied the vote and could not run for office  In ten states  6  coalitions of freedmen  recent black and white arrivals from the North  carpetbaggers   and white Southerners who supported Reconstruction  scalawags  cooperated to form Republican biracial state governments  They introduced various reconstruction programs  including the founding of public schools in most states for the first time  and the establishment of charitable institutions  They raised taxes  which historically had been low as planters preferred to make private investments for their own purposes  offered massive aid to support railroads to improve transportation and shipping  Conservative opponents charged that Republican regimes were marred by widespread corruption  Violent opposition towards freedmen and whites who supported Reconstruction emerged in numerous localities under the name of the Ku Klux Klan  KKK   a secret vigilante organization  which led to federal intervention by President Ulysses S  Grant in 1871 that closed down the Klan  Conservative white Democrats calling themselves  Redeemers  regained control state by state  sometimes using fraud and violence to control state elections  A deep national economic depression following the Panic of 1873 led to major Democratic gains in the North  the collapse of many railroad schemes in the South  and a growing sense of frustration in the North  The end of Reconstruction was a staggered process  and the period of Republican control ended at different times in different states  With the Compromise of 1877  Army intervention in the South ceased and Republican control collapsed in the last three state governments in the South  This was followed by a period that white Southerners labeled Redemption  in which white dominated state legislatures enacted Jim Crow laws and  after 1890  disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites through a combination of constitutional amendments and electoral laws  The white Democrat Southerners  memory of Reconstruction played a major role in imposing the system of white supremacy and second class citizenship for blacks  known as the age of Jim Crow  7   edit  Purpose Reconstruction addressed how the eleven seceding states would regain self government and be reseated in Congress  the civil status of the former leaders of the Confederacy  and the Constitutional and legal status of freedmen  especially their civil rights and whether they should be given the right to vote  Violent controversy erupted throughout the South over these issues  8  The laws and constitutional amendments that laid the foundation for the most radical phase of Reconstruction were adopted from 1866 to 1871  By the 1870s  Reconstruction had officially provided freedmen with equal rights under the constitution  and blacks were voting and taking political office  Republican legislatures  coalitions of whites and blacks  established the first public school systems and numerous charitable institutions in the South  Beginning in 1874  however  there was a rise in white paramilitary organizations  such as the White League and Red Shirts in the Deep South  whose political aim was to drive out the Republicans  They also disrupted political organizing and terrorized blacks to bar them from the polls in Louisiana  Mississippi  North and South Carolina  9  From 1873 to 1877  conservative white Democrats  calling themselves  Redeemers   regained power in the states  In the 1860s and 1870s the terms  radical  and  conservative  had distinctive meanings   Conservatism  in this context generally indicates the mindset of the ruling elite of the planter class  Many leaders had been Whigs and were committed to modernization  10  Most of the  radical  Republicans in the North were men who believed in free enterprise and industrialization  most were also modernizers and ex Whigs  11  The  Liberal Republicans  of 1872 shared the same outlook except they were especially opposed to the corruption they saw around President Grant  and believed that the goals had been achieved so that the federal intervention could now end  Passage of the 13th  14th  and 15th Amendments are constitutional legacies of Reconstruction  These Reconstruction Amendments established the rights which  through extensive litigation  led to Supreme Court rulings starting in the early 20th century that struck down discriminatory state laws  A  Second Reconstruction   sparked by the Civil Rights Movement  led to civil rights laws in 1964 and 1965 that protected and enforced full civic rights of African Americans   edit  Material devastation of the South in 1865 The southern economy had been ruined by the war  Charleston  South Carolina  Broad Street  1865 Further information  History of the Southern United States Reconstruction played out against a backdrop of a once prosperous economy in ruins  The Confederacy in 1861 had 297 towns and cities with a combined population of 835 000  of these  162 locations with 681 000 total residents were at one point occupied by Union forces  Eleven were destroyed or severely damaged by war action  including Atlanta  Georgia  Charleston  South Carolina  Columbia  South Carolina  and Richmond  Virginia  these eleven contained 115 900 people in the 1860 census  or 14  of the urban South  The number of people who lived in the destroyed towns represented just over 1  of the Confederacy s combined urban and rural populations  In addition  45 courthouses were burned  out of 830   destroying the documentation for the legal relationships in the affected communities  12  Farms were in disrepair  and the prewar stock of horses  mules and cattle was much depleted  The South s farms were not highly mechanized  but the value of farm implements and machinery in the 1860 Census was  81 million and was reduced by 40  by 1870  13  The transportation infrastructure lay in ruins  with little railroad or riverboat service available to move crops and animals to market  14  Railroad mileage was located mostly in rural areas and over two thirds of the South s rails  bridges  rail yards  repair shops and rolling stock were in areas reached by Union armies  which systematically destroyed what they could  Even in untouched areas  the lack of maintenance and repair  the absence of new equipment  the heavy over use  and the deliberate relocation of equipment by the Confederates from remote areas to the war zone ensured the system would be ruined at war s end  12  Restoring the infrastructure especially the railroad system became a high priority for Reconstruction state governments  The enormous cost of the Confederate war effort took a high toll on the South s economic infrastructure  The direct costs to the Confederacy in human capital  government expenditures  and physical destruction from the war totaled  3 3 billion  By 1865  the Confederate dollar was worthless due to massive inflation  and people in the South had to resort to bartering services for goods  or else use scarce Union dollars  With the emancipation of the southern slaves  the entire economy of the South had to be rebuilt  Having lost their enormous investment in slaves  white planters had minimal capital to pay freedmen workers to bring in crops  As a result  a system of sharecropping was developed where landowners broke up large plantations and rented small lots to the freedmen and their families  The South was transformed from a prosperous minority of landed gentry slaveholders into a tenant farming agriculture system  The end of the Civil War was accompanied by a large migration of new freedpeople to the cities  15  In the cities  African Americans were relegated to the lowest paying jobs such as unskilled and service labor  Men worked as rail workers  rolling and lumber mills workers  and hotels workers  The large population of slave artisans during antebellum had not translated into a large number of freemen artisans during the Reconstruction  16  Black women were largely confined to domestic work employed as cooks  maids  and child nurses  Others worked in hotels  A large number became laundresses  Per capita income for white southerners declined from  125 in 1857 to a low of  80 in 1879  By the end of the 19th century and well into the 20th century  the South was locked into a system of poverty  How much of this failure was caused by the war and by previous reliance on agriculture remains the subject of debate among economists and historians  17   edit  Restoring the South to the Union A political cartoon of Andrew Johnson and Abraham Lincoln  1865  entitled  The Rail Splitter At Work Repairing the Union   The caption reads  Johnson   Take it quietly Uncle Abe and I will draw it closer than ever   Lincoln   A few more stitches Andy and the good old Union will be mended  During the Civil War  the Radical Republican leaders argued that slavery and the Slave Power had to be permanently destroyed  and that all forms of Confederate nationalism had to be suppressed  Moderates said this could be easily accomplished as soon as Confederate armies surrendered and the Southern states repealed secession and accepted the 13th Amendment   most of which happened by December 1865  18  President Lincoln was the leader of the moderate Republicans and wanted to speed up Reconstruction and reunite the nation painlessly and quickly  Lincoln formally began Reconstruction in late 1863 with his Ten percent plan  which went into operation in several states but which Radical Republicans opposed  Lincoln vetoed the Radical plan  the Wade Davis Bill of 1864  which was much more strict than the Ten Percent Plan  19  The opposing faction of Radical Republicans were skeptical of Southern intentions and demanded more stringent federal action  Congressman Thaddeus Stevens and Senator Charles Sumner led the Radicals  Sumner argued that secession had destroyed statehood but the Constitution still extended its authority and its protection over individuals  as in the territories  Thaddeus Stevens and his followers viewed secession as having left the states in a status like new territories  The Republicans sought to prevent Southern politicians from  restoring the historic subordination of Negroes   Since slavery was abolished  the three fifths compromise no longer applied to counting the population of blacks  After the 1870 census  the South would gain numerous additional representatives in Congress  based on the population of freedmen  20  One Illinois Republican expressed a common fear that if the South were allowed to simply restore its previous established powers  that the  reward of treason will be an increased representation   21  Upon Lincoln s assassination in April 1865  Andrew Johnson of Tennessee  who had been elected with Lincoln in 1864 on the ticket of the National Union Party as the latter s vice president  became president  Johnson rejected the Radical program of harsh  lengthy Reconstruction and instead appointed his own governors and tried to finish reconstruction by the end of 1865  By early 1866  full scale political warfare existed between Johnson  now allied with the Democrats  and the Radical Republicans  he vetoed laws and issued orders that contradicted Congressional legislation  22  Congress rejected Johnson s argument that he had the war power to decide what to do  since the war was over  Congress decided it had the primary authority to decide how Reconstruction should proceed  because the Constitution stated the United States had to guarantee each state a republican form of government  The Radicals insisted that meant Congress decided how Reconstruction should be achieved  The issues were multiple  who should decide  Congress or the president  How should republicanism operate in the South  What was the status of the Confederate states  What was the citizenship status of men who had supported the Confederacy  What was the citizenship and suffrage status of freedmen  23  The election of 1866 decisively changed the balance of power  giving the Republicans two thirds majorities in both houses of Congress  and enough votes to overcome Johnson s vetoes  They moved to impeach Johnson because of his constant attempts to thwart Radical Reconstruction measures  by using the Tenure of Office Act  Johnson was acquitted by one vote  but he lost the influence to shape Reconstruction policy  24  See Impeachment of Andrew Johnson The Republican Congress established military districts in the South and used Army personnel to administer the region until new governments loyal to the Union could be established  While Congress temporarily suspended the ability to vote of approximately 10 000 to 15 000 white men who had been Confederate officials or senior officers  constitutional amendments gave full citizenship and suffrage to former slaves  25  With the power to vote  freedmen started participating in politics  While many slaves were illiterate  educated blacks  including escaped slaves  moved down from the North to aid them  and natural leaders also stepped forward  They elected white and black men to represent them in constitutional conventions  A Republican coalition of freedmen  southerners supportive of the Union  derisively called scalawags by white Democrats   and northerners who had migrated to the South  derisively called carpetbaggers some of whom were returning natives  but were mostly Union veterans   organized to create constitutional conventions  They created new state constitutions to set new directions for southern states  26   edit  Loyalty The issue of loyalty emerged in the debates over the Wade Davis Bill of 1864  The bill required voters to take the  ironclad oath   swearing they had never supported the Confederacy or been one of its soldiers  Pursuing a policy of  malice toward none  announced in his second inaugural address  Lincoln asked voters only to support the Union  27  The Radicals lost support following Lincoln s veto of the Wade Davis Bill but regained strength after Lincoln s assassination in April 1865   edit  Suffrage Monument in honor of the Grand Army of the Republic  organized after the war Congress had to consider how to restore to full status and representation within the Union those southern states that had declared their independence from the United States and had withdrawn their representation  Suffrage for former Confederates was one of two main concerns  A decision needed to be made whether to allow just some or all former Confederates to vote  and to hold office   The moderates wanted virtually all of them to vote  but the Radicals resisted  They repeatedly tried to impose the ironclad oath  which would effectively have allowed no former Confederates to vote  Representative Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania proposed  unsuccessfully  that all former Confederates lose the right to vote for five years  The compromise that was reached disfranchised many former Confederate civil and military leaders  No one knows how many temporarily lost the vote  but one estimate was 10 000 to 15 000  28  Second  and closely related  was the issue of whether freedmen should be allowed to vote  The issue was how to receive the four million former slaves as citizens  If they were to be fully counted as citizens  some sort of representation for apportionment of seats in Congress had to be determined  Before the war  the population of slaves had been counted as three fifths of a comparable number of free whites  By having four million freedmen counted as full citizens  the South would gain additional seats in Congress  If blacks were denied the vote and the right to hold office  then only whites would represent them  Many conservatives  including most white southerners  northern Democrats  and some northern Republicans  opposed black voting  Some northern states that had referendums on the subject limited the ability of their own small populations of blacks to vote  Lincoln had supported a middle position to allow some black men to vote  especially army veterans  Johnson also believed that such service should be rewarded with citizenship  Lincoln proposed giving the vote to  the very intelligent  and especially those who have fought gallantly in our ranks   29  In 1864  Governor Johnson said   The better class of them will go to work and sustain themselves  and that class ought to be allowed to vote  on the ground that a loyal negro is more worthy than a disloyal white man   30  As President in 1865  Johnson wrote to the man he appointed as governor of Mississippi  recommending   If you could extend the elective franchise to all persons of color who can read the Constitution in English and write their names  and to all persons of color who own real estate valued at at least two hundred and fifty dollars  and pay taxes thereon  you would completely disarm the adversary  Radicals in Congress   and set an example the other states will follow   31  Senators Charles Sumner of Massachusetts and Thaddeus Stevens  leaders of the Radical Republicans  were initially hesitant to enfranchise the largely illiterate former slave population  Sumner preferred at first impartial requirements that would have imposed literacy restrictions on blacks and whites  He believed that he would not succeed in passing legislation to disfranchise illiterate whites who already had the vote  32  In the South  many poor whites were illiterate as there was almost no public education before the war  In 1880  for example  the white illiteracy rate was about 25  in Tennessee  Kentucky  Alabama  South Carolina  and Georgia  and as high as 33  in North Carolina  This compares with the 9  national rate  and a black rate of illiteracy that was over 70  in the South  33  By 1900  however  with emphasis within the black community on education  the majority of blacks had achieved literacy  34  Sumner soon concluded that  there was no substantial protection for the freedman except in the franchise   This was necessary  he stated    1  For his own protection   2  For the protection of the white Unionist  and  3  For the peace of the country  We put the musket in his hands because it was necessary  for the same reason we must give him the franchise   The support for voting rights was a compromise between moderate and Radical Republicans  35  The Republicans believed that the best way for men to get political experience was to be able to vote and to participate in the political system  They passed laws allowing all male freedmen to vote  In 1867  black men voted for the first time  Over the course of Reconstruction  more than 1 500 African Americans held public office in the South  some of them were men who had escaped to the North and gained educations  and returned to the South  They did not hold office in numbers representative of their proportion in the population  but often elected whites to represent them  36  The question of women s suffrage was also debated but was rejected  37  From 1890 to 1908  southern states passed new constitutions and laws that disfranchised most blacks and tens of thousands of poor whites with new voter registration and electoral rules  When establishing new requirements such as subjectively administered literacy tests  in some states  they used  grandfather clauses  to enable illiterate whites to vote  38   edit  Southern Treaty Commission The Five Civilized Tribes that had been relocated to Indian Territory  now part of Oklahoma  held black slaves and signed treaties supporting the Confederacy  During the war a civil war among pro  and anti Union Indians raged  Congress passed a statute that gave the President the authority to suspend the appropriations of any tribe if the tribe is  in a state of actual hostility to the government of the United States  and  by proclamation  to declare all treaties with such tribe to be abrogated by such tribe  25 USC Sec  72   39  As a component of Reconstruction  the Interior Department ordered a meeting of representatives from all Indian tribes which had affiliated with the Confederacy  40  The Council  the Southern Treaty Commission  was first held in Ft  Smith  Arkansas in September 1865  was attended by hundreds of Indians representing dozens of tribes  Over the next several years the commission negotiated treaties with tribes that resulted in additional relocations to Indian Territory and the de facto creation  initially by treaty  of an unorganized Oklahoma Territory   edit  Lincoln s Presidential Reconstruction President Abraham Lincoln 16th President of the United States 1861 1865  edit  Preliminary events President Lincoln signed two Confiscation Acts into law  the first on August 6  1861  and the second on July 17  1862  safeguarding fugitive slaves from the Confederacy that came over into Union lines and giving them indirect emancipation if their masters continued insurrection against the United States  The laws allowed the confiscation of lands for colonization from those who aided and supported the rebellion  However  these laws had limited effect as they were poorly funded by Congress and poorly enforced by Attorney General Edward Bates  41  42  43  In August 1861  Maj  Gen  John C  Fr mont  Union commander of the Western Department  declared martial law in Missouri  confiscated Confederate property  and emancipated their slaves  President Lincoln immediately ordered Fr mont to rescind his emancipation declaration stating   I think there is great danger that       the liberating slaves of traitorous owners  will alarm our Southern Union friends  and turn them against us   perhaps ruin our fair prospect for Kentucky   After Fr mont refused to rescind the emancipation order  President Lincoln terminated him from active duty on November 2  1861  Lincoln was concerned that border states would bolt from the Union if slaves were given their freedom  On May 26  1862  Union Maj  Gen  David Hunter emancipated slaves in South Carolina  Georgia  and Florida stated all  persons     heretofore held as slaves     forever free   Lincoln  embarrassed by the order  rescinded Hunter s declaration and cancelled the emancipations  44  On April 16  1862 Lincoln signed a bill into law outlawing slavery in Washington D C  and freeing the estimated 3 500 slaves in the city and on June 19  1862 he signed legislation outlawing slavery in all U S  territories  In July 1862  under the authority of the Confiscation Acts and an amended Force Bill of 1795  he authorized the recruitment of freed slaves into the Union army and seizure of any Confederate property for military purposes  43  45  46   edit  Gradual emancipation and compensation In an effort to keep border states in the Union  President Lincoln as early as 1861 designed gradual compensated emancipation programs paid for by government bonds  Lincoln desired Delaware  Maryland  Kentucky  and Missouri to  adopt a system of gradual emancipation which should work the extinction of slavery in twenty years   On March 26  1862 Lincoln met with Senator Charles Sumner and recommended that a special joint session of Congress be conveyed to discuss giving financial aid to any border states who initiated a gradual emancipation plan  In April 1862  the joint session of Congress met  however  the border states were not interested and did not make any response to Lincoln or any Congressional emancipation proposal  47  Lincoln advocated compensated emancipation during the 1865 River Queen steamer conference   edit  Colonization In August 1862  President Lincoln met with African American leaders and urged them to colonize some place in Central America  Lincoln planned to free the slaves in the Emancipation Proclamation and he was concerned that freedmen would not be well treated in the United States by Whites both in the North and South  Although Lincoln gave assurances that the United States government would support and protect any colonies  the leaders declined the offer of colonization  Many free blacks had been opposed to colonization plans in the past and wanted to remain in the United States  President Lincoln persisted in his colonization plan believing that emancipation and colonization were part of the same program  Lincoln was successful by April 1863 at sending black colonists to Haiti and 453 to Chiriqui in Central America  however  none of the colonies was able to remain self sufficient  Frederick Douglass  a prominent 19th century American civil rights activist  criticized that Lincoln was  showing all his inconsistencies  his pride of race and blood  his contempt for Negroes and his canting hypocrisy   African Americans  according to Douglas  wanted citizen rights rather than to be colonized  By the end of 1863 President Lincoln gave up on African American colonization  43  47  48   edit  Military governors installed Starting in March 1862  in an effort to forestall Reconstruction by the Radicals in Congress  President Lincoln installed military governors in certain rebellious states under Union military control  49  Although the states would not be recognized by the Radicals until an undetermined time  installation of military governors kept the administration of Reconstruction under Presidential control  rather than that of the increasingly unsympathetic Radical Congress  On March 3  1862  Lincoln installed a loyalist Democrat Senator Andrew Johnson  as Military Governor with the rank of Brigadier General in his home state of Tennessee  50  In May 1862  Lincoln appointed Edward Stanly Military Governor of the coastal region of North Carolina with the rank of Brigadier General  Stanly resigned almost a year later when he angered Lincoln by closing two schools for black children in New Bern  After Lincoln installed Brigadier General George F  Sheply as Military Governor of Louisiana in May 1862  Sheply sent two anti slavery representatives  Benjamin Flanders and Michael Hahn  elected in December 1862  to the House which capitulated and voted to seat them  In July 1862  Lincoln installed Colonel John S  Phelps as Military Governor of Arkansas  though he resigned soon after due to poor health   edit  Emancipation Proclamation Main article  Emancipation Proclamation In July 1862  President Lincoln became convinced that  a military necessity  was needed to strike at slavery in order to win the Civil War for the Union  The Confiscation Acts were only having a minimal effect to end slavery  On July 22  he wrote a first draft of the Emancipation Proclamation that freed the slaves in states in rebellion  Lincoln decided not to release the document until there was a Union victory in the battlefield  After he showed his cabinet the document  slight alterations were made in the wording  Then on September 22  1862  George McClellan defeated Robert E  Lee at Antietam  the second draft of the Emancipation Proclamation was issued to the public the following day  On January 1  1863  the second part of the Emancipation Proclamation was issued  specifically naming ten states in which slaves would be  forever free   The proclamation did not name the states of Tennessee  Kentucky  Missouri  Maryland  and Delaware  and specifically excluded numerous counties in some other states  Eventually  as the Union Armies advanced into the Confederacy millions of slaves were set free  Many of these freedmen joined the Union army and fought in battles against the Confederate forces  43  48  51   edit  Louisiana 10  electorate plan President Abraham Lincoln was concerned to effect a speedy restoration of the Confederate states to the Union after the Civil War  In 1863  President Lincoln proposed a moderate plan for the Reconstruction of the captured Confederate State of Louisiana  The plan granted amnesty to Rebels who took an oath of loyalty to the Union  Black Freedmen workers were tied to labor on plantations for one year at  10 a month pay  52  Only 10  of the state s electorate had to take the loyalty oath in order for the state to be readmitted into U S  Congress  The state was required to abolish slavery in its new constitution  Identical Reconstruction plans would be adopted in Arkansas and Tennessee  By December 1864  the Lincoln plan of Reconstruction had been enacted in Louisiana and the legislature sent two Senators and five Representatives to take their seats in Washington  However  Congress refused to count any of the votes from Louisiana  Arkansas  and Tennessee  in essence rejecting Lincoln s moderate Reconstruction plan  Congress  at this time controlled by the Radicals  proposed the Wade Davis Bill that required a majority of the state electorates to take the oath of loyalty to be admitted to Congress  Lincoln pocket vetoed the bill and the rift widened between the moderates  who wanted to save the Union and win the war  and the Radicals  who wanted to effect a more complete change within Southern society  53  54  Frederick Douglass denounced Lincoln s 10  electorate plan undemocratic since state admission and loyalty only depended on a minority vote  55   edit  Legalization of slave unions Prior to 1864  slave marriages were not legally recognized  emancipation did not affect them  56  When freed  many former slaves made official marriages  Before emancipation  slaves could not enter into contracts  including the marriage contract  After emancipation  former slaves and whites both began to view the lack of officially recognized marriage for their unions as problematic  Not all free people formalized their unions  Some continued to have common law marriages or community recognized relationships  57  The acknowledgement of marriage by the state increased the state s recognition of freedpeople as legal actors and eventually helped make the case for parental rights for freedpeople against the practice of apprenticeship of black children  58  These children were legally taken away from their families under the guise of  providing the with guardianship and  good  homes until they reached the age of consent at twenty one  under acts such as the Georgia 1866 Apprentice Act  59  Such children were generally used as sources of unpaid labor   edit  Freedmen s Bureau Main article  Freedmen s Bureau On March 3  1865 the Freedmen s Bureau Bill became law  sponsored by the Republicans to aid freedmen and white refugees  A federal Bureau was created to provide food  clothing  fuel  and advice on negotiating labor contracts  It attempted to oversee new relations between freedmen and their former masters in a free labor market  The Act  without deference to a person s color  authorized the Bureau to lease confiscated land for a period of three years and to sell it in portions of up to 40 acres per buyer  The Bureau was to expire one year after the termination of the War  Lincoln was assassinated before he could appoint a commissioner of the Bureau  A popular myth was that the Act offered 40 acres and a mule  or that slaves had been promised this  60  61  62   edit  Bans color discrimination Other legislation was signed that broadened equality and rights for African Americans  Lincoln outlawed discrimination on account of color  in carrying U S  mail  in riding on public street cars in Washington D C   and in pay for soldiers  63   edit  February 1865 peace conference Lincoln and Secretary of State William H  Seward met with three southern representatives to discuss the peaceful reconstruction of the Union and the Confederacy on February 3  1865 in Hampton Roads  Virginia  The southern delegation included Confederate vice president  Alexander H  Stephens  John A  Campbell  and Robert M T  Hunter  The southerners proposed the Union recognition of the Confederacy  a joint Union Confederate attack on Mexico to oust dictator Maximillian  and an alternative subordinate status of servitude for blacks rather than slavery  Lincoln flatly denied recognition of the Confederacy  and said that the slaves covered by his Emancipation Proclamation would not be re enslaved  He said that the Union States were about to pass the Thirteenth Amendment outlawing slavery  Lincoln urged the governor of Georgia to remove Confederate troops and  ratify this Constitutional Amendment prospectively  so as to take effect say in five years   Slavery is doomed   Lincoln also urged compensated emancipation for the slaves as he thought the North should be willing to share the costs of freedom  Although the meeting was cordial  the parties did not settle on agreements  64   edit  Historical legacy debated Lincoln continued to advocate his Louisiana Plan as a model for all states up until his assassination on April 14  1865  The plan successfully started the Reconstruction process of ratifying the Thirteenth Amendment in all states  Lincoln is typically portrayed as taking the moderate position and fighting the Radical positions  There is considerable debate on how well Lincoln  had he lived  would have handled Congress during the Reconstruction process that took place after the Civil War ended  One historical camp argues that Lincoln s flexibility  pragmatism  and superior political skills with Congress would have solved Reconstruction with far less difficulty  The other camp believes the Radicals would have attempted to impeach Lincoln  just as they did to his successor  Andrew Johnson  in 1868  53  65   edit  Johnson s presidential Reconstruction President Andrew Johnson 17th President of the United States 1865 1869 Northern anger over the assassination of Lincoln and the immense human cost of the war led to vengeful demands for harsh policies  Vice President Andrew Johnson had taken a hard line and spoke of hanging rebel Confederates  but when he succeeded Lincoln as President  Johnson took a much softer line  pardoning many Confederate leaders and former Confederates  66 Jefferson Davis was held in prison for two years  but other Confederate leaders were not  There were no treason trials  Only one person Captain Henry Wirz  the commandant of the prison camp in Andersonville  Georgia was executed for war crimes  According historian Eric Foner  Andrew Johnson s conservative view of Reconstruction did not include blacks or former slaves involvement in government and he refused to heed Northern concerns when southern state legislatures implemented Black Codes that lowered the status of the freedmen similar to slavery  67  Andrew Johnson s presidency would be known primarily for the non enforcement and defiance of Reconstruction laws passed by the U S  Congress and would be in constant conflict constitutionally with the Radicals in Congress over the status of freedmen and whites in the defeated South  68  Although resigned to the abolition of slavery  many former Confederates were not willing to accept the social changes nor political domination by former slaves  The defeated were unwilling to acknowledge that their society had changed  In the words of Benjamin F  Perry  President Johnson s choice as the provisional governor of South Carolina   First  the Negro is to be invested with all political power  and then the antagonism of interest between capital and labor is to work out the result   69  The fears  however  of the mostly conservative planter elite and other leading white citizens were partly assuaged by the actions of President Johnson  who ensured that a wholesale land redistribution from the planters to the freedman did not occur  President Johnson ordered that confiscated or abandoned lands administered by the Freedman s Bureau would not be redistributed to the freedmen but be returned to pardoned owners  Land was returned that would have been forfeited under the Confiscation Acts passed by Congress in 1861 and 1862   edit  Freedmen and the enactment of Black Codes A Harper s Magazine political cartoon alleging Ku Klux Klan and White League opposition to Reconstruction Southern state governments quickly enacted the restrictive  black codes   However  they were abolished in 1866 and seldom had effect  because the Freedman s Bureau  not the local courts  handled the legal affairs of freedmen  The Black Codes indicated the plans of the southern whites for the former slaves  70  The freedmen would have more rights than did free blacks before the war  but they still had only a limited set of second class civil rights  no voting rights  and  since they were not citizens  they could not own firearms  serve on a jury in a lawsuit involving whites or move about without employment  71  The Black Codes would limit blacks  ability to control their own employment  The Black Codes outraged northern opinion  They were overthrown by the Civil Rights Act of 1866 that gave the freedmen full legal equality  except for the right to vote   72  The freedmen rejected gang labor work patterns that had been used in slavery  with the strong backing of the Freedman s Bureau  Instead of gang labor  freedpeople preferred family based labor groups  56  They forced planters to bargain for their labor  Such bargaining soon led to the establishment of the system of sharecropping  which gave the freedmen greater economic independence and social autonomy than gang labor  However  because they lacked capital and the planters continued to own the means of production  tools  draft animals and land   the freedmen were forced into producing cash crops  mainly cotton  for the land owners and merchants  and they entered into a crop lien system  Widespread poverty  disruption to an agricultural economy too dependent on cotton  and the falling price of cotton  led within decades to the routine indebtedness of the majority of the freedmen  and poverty by many planters  73  Northern officials gave varying reports on conditions for the freedmen in the South  One harsh assessment came from Carl Schurz  who reported on the situation in the states along the Gulf Coast  His report documented dozens of extra judicial killings and claimed that hundreds or thousands more African Americans were killed  74  The number of murders and assaults perpetrated upon Negroes is very great  we can form only an approximative estimate of what is going on in those parts of the South which are not closely garrisoned  and from which no regular reports are received  by what occurs under the very eyes of our military authorities  As to my personal experience  I will only mention that during my two days sojourn at Atlanta  one Negro was stabbed with fatal effect on the street  and three were poisoned  one of whom died  While I was at Montgomery  one negro was cut across the throat evidently with intent to kill  and another was shot  but both escaped with their lives  Several papers attached to this report give an account of the number of capital cases that occurred at certain places during a certain period of time  It is a sad fact that the perpetration of those acts is not confined to that class of people which might be called the rabble  Carl Schurz   Report on the Condition of the South   December 1865  U S  Senate Exec  Doc  No  2  39th Congress  1st session   The report included sworn testimony from soldiers and officials of the Freedman s Bureau  In Selma  Alabama  Major J P  Houston noted that whites who killed 12 African Americans in his district never came to trial  Many more killings never became official cases  Captain Poillon described white patrols in southwestern Alabama who board some of the boats  after the boats leave they hang  shoot  or drown the victims they may find on them  and all those found on the roads or coming down the rivers are almost invariably murdered  The bewildered and terrified freedmen know not what to do to leave is death  to remain is to suffer the increased burden imposed upon them by the cruel taskmaster  whose only interest is their labor  wrung from them by every device an inhuman ingenuity can devise  hence the lash and murder is resorted to intimidate those whom fear of an awful death alone cause to remain  while patrols  Negro dogs and spies  disguised as Yankees  keep constant guard over these unfortunate people  citation needed  Much of the violence that was perpetrated against African Americans was shaped by gendered prejudices regarding African Americans  Black women were in a particularly vulnerable situation  To convict a white man of sexually assaulting black women in this period was exceedingly difficult  59  Black women were socially constructed as sexually avaricious and since they were portrayed as having little virtue  society held that they could not be raped  58  This contributed to numerous sexual crimes against black women in this period  For example  two freedwomen  Frances Thompson and Lucy Smith  describe their violent sexual assault during the Memphis Riots of 1866  75  However  black women were vulnerable even in times of relative normalcy  Sexual assaults on African American women were so pervasive  particularly on the part of their white employers  that black men sought to reduce the contact between white males and black females by having the women in their family avoid doing work that was closely overseen by whites  56  Black men were construed as being extremely sexually aggressive and their supposed or rumored threats to white women were often used as a pretext for lynching and castrations  59   edit  Moderate responses During fall 1865  out of response to the Black codes and worrisome signs of Southern recalcitrance  the Radical Republicans blocked the readmission of the former rebellious states to the Congress  Johnson  however  was content with allowing former Confederate states into the Union as long as their state governments adopted the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery  By December 6  1865  the amendment was ratified and Johnson considered Reconstruction over  Johnson was following the moderate Lincoln Presidential Reconstruction policy to get the states readmitted as soon as possible  76  Congress  however  controlled by the Radicals  had other plans  The Radicals were led by Charles Sumner in the Senate and Thaddeus Stevens in the House of Representatives  Congress  on December 4  1865  rejected Johnson s moderate Presidential Reconstruction  and organized the Joint Committee on Reconstruction  a 15 member panel to devise reconstruction requirements for the Southern states to be restored to the Union  76  In January 1866  Congress renewed the Freedman s Bureau  however  Johnson vetoed the Freedmen s Bureau Bill in February 1866  Although Johnson had sympathies for the plights of the freedmen  he was against federal assistance  An attempt to override the veto failed on February 20  1866  This veto shocked the Congressional Radicals  In response  both the Senate and House passed a joint resolution not to allow any Senator or Representative seat admittance until Congress decided when Reconstruction was finished  76  Senator Lyman Trumbull of Illinois  leader of the moderate Republicans  took affront at the black codes  He proposed the first Civil Rights Law  because the abolition of slavery was empty if laws are to be enacted and enforced depriving persons of African descent of privileges which are essential to freemen    A law that does not allow a colored person to go from one county to another  and one that does not allow him to hold property  to teach  to preach  are certainly laws in violation of the rights of a freeman    The purpose of this bill is to destroy all these discriminations  77  The key to the bill was the opening section  All persons born in the United States     are hereby declared to be citizens of the United States  and such citizens of every race and color  without regard to any previous condition of slavery     shall have the same right in every State    to make and enforce contracts  to sue  be parties  and give evidence  to inherit  purchase  lease  sell  hold  and convey real and personal property  and to full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property  as is enjoyed by white citizens  and shall be subject to like punishment  pains  and penalties and to none other  any law  statute  ordinance  regulation  or custom to the Contrary notwithstanding  Congress quickly passed the Civil Rights bill  the Senate on February 2 voted 33 12  the House on March 13 voted 111 38   edit  Johnson s vetoes Although strongly urged by moderates in Congress to sign the Civil Rights bill  Johnson broke decisively with them by vetoing it on March 27  1866  His veto message objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when eleven out of thirty six states were unrepresented and attempted to fix by Federal law  a perfect equality of the white and black races in every State of the Union   Johnson said it was an invasion by Federal authority of the rights of the States  it had no warrant in the Constitution and was contrary to all precedents  It was a  stride toward centralization and the concentration of all legislative power in the national government   78  The debate over reconstruction and the Freedman s Bureau was nationwide  This 1866 Pennsylvania election poster alleged that the Bureau kept the Negro in idleness at the expense of the hard working white taxpayer  A racist caricature of an African American is depicted  79  The Democratic Party  proclaiming itself the party of white men  north and south  supported Johnson  80  However the Republicans in Congress overrode his veto  the Senate by the close vote of 33 15  the House by 122 41  and the Civil Rights bill became law  Congress also passed a toned down Freedmen s Bureau Bill  Johnson quickly vetoed as he had done to the previous bill  This time  however  Congress had enough support and overrode Johnson s veto  The last moderate proposal was the Fourteenth Amendment  whose principal drafter was Representative John Bingham  It was designed to put the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act into the Constitution  but it went much further  It extended citizenship to everyone born in the United States  except visitors and Indians on reservations   penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen  and most importantly  created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts  It guaranteed the Federal war debt would be paid  and promised the Confederate debt would never be paid   Johnson used his influence to block the amendment in the states since three fourths of the states were required for ratification  the amendment was later ratified    The moderate effort to compromise with Johnson had failed  and a political fight broke out between the Republicans  both Radical and moderate  on one side  and on the other side  Johnson and his allies in the Democratic party in the North  and the conservative groupings  which used different names  in each southern state   edit  Congress imposes Radical Reconstruction Concerned that President Johnson viewed Congress as an  illegal body  and was attempting to overthrow the government  Republicans in Congress took control of Reconstruction policies after the election of 1866  81  Johnson ignored the policy mandate  and he openly encouraged southern states to deny to ratify the 14th Amendment  except for Tennessee  all former Confederate states did refuse to ratify  as did the border states of Delaware  Maryland and Kentucky   Radical Republicans in Congress  led by Stevens and Sumner  opened the way to suffrage for male freedmen  They were generally in control  although they had to compromise with the moderate Republicans  the Democrats in Congress had almost no power   Historians generally refer to this period as Radical Reconstruction  82  The South s white leaders  who held power in the immediate postwar era before the vote was granted to the freedmen  renounced secession and slavery  but not white supremacy  People who had previously held power were angered in 1867 when new elections were held  New Republican lawmakers were elected by a coalition of white Unionists  freedmen and northerners who had settled in the South  Some leaders in the South tried to accommodate to new conditions   edit  Constitutional amendments Three Constitutional amendments  known as the Reconstruction Amendments  were adopted  The 13th Amendment abolishing slavery was ratified in 1865  The 14th Amendment was proposed in 1866 and ratified in 1868  guaranteeing United States citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States and granting them federal civil rights  The 15th Amendment  proposed in late February 1869 and passed in early February 1870  decreed that the right to vote could not be denied because of  race  color  or previous condition of servitude   The amendment did not declare the vote an unconditional right  it prohibited these types of discrimination  States would still determine voter registration and electoral laws  The amendments were directed at ending slavery and providing full citizenship to freedmen  Northern Congressmen believed that providing black men with the right to vote would be the most rapid means of political education and training  While many blacks took an active part in voting and political life  and rapidly continued to build churches and community organizations  following Reconstruction white Democrats and insurgent groups used force to regain power in the state legislatures  and pass laws that effectively disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites in the South  Early Supreme Court rulings around the turn of the 19th to 20th century upheld many of these new southern constitutions and laws  and most blacks were prevented from voting in the South until the 1960s  Full federal enforcement of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments did not occur until passage of legislation in the mid 1960s as a result of the African American Civil Rights Movement  1955 1968   For details  see  Redemption  United States history  Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era  United States  Jim Crow laws United States v  Cruikshank  1875   which was

2254    edit  Military reconstruction With the Radicals in control  Congress passed the Reconstruction Acts on July 19  1867  The first Reconstruction Act placed ten Confederate states under military control  grouping them into five military districts  83  First Military District  Virginia  under General John Schofield Second Military District  North Carolina and South Carolina  under General Daniel Sickles Third Military District  Georgia  Alabama and Florida  under General John Pope and George Meade Fourth Military District  Arkansas and Mississippi  under General Edward Ord Fifth Military District  Texas and Louisiana  under Generals Philip Sheridan and Winfield Scott Hancock 20 000 U S  troops were deployed to enforce the Act  Tennessee was not made part of a military district  having already been readmitted to the Union   and therefore federal controls did not apply  The ten Southern state governments were re constituted under the direct control of the United States Army  One major purpose was to recognize and protect the right of African Americans to vote  84  There was little or no combat  but rather a state of martial law in which the military closely supervised local government  supervised elections  and tried to protect office holders and freedmen from violence  85  Blacks were enrolled as voters  former Confederate leaders were excluded for a limited period  Foner 1988 p 274 5  No one state was entirely representative  Randolph Campbell describes what happened in Texas  86  The first critical step     was the registration of voters according to guidelines established by Congress and interpreted by Generals Sheridan and Charles Griffin  The Reconstruction Acts called for registering all adult males  white and black  except those who had ever sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States and then engaged in rebellion     Sheridan interpreted these restrictions stringently  barring from registration not only all pre 1861 officials of state and local governments who had supported the Confederacy but also all city officeholders and even minor functionaries such as sextons of cemeteries  In May Griffin     appointed a three man board of registrars for each county  making his choices on the advice of known scalawags and local Freedman s Bureau agents  In every county where practicable a freedman served as one of the three registrars     Final registration amounted to approximately 59 633 whites and 49 479 blacks  It is impossible to say how many whites were rejected or refused to register  estimates vary from 7 500 to 12 000   but blacks  who constituted only about 30 percent of the state s population  were significantly overrepresented at 45 percent of all voters  87  All Southern states were readmitted to representation in Congress by the end of 1870  the last being Georgia  All but 500 top Confederate leaders were pardoned when President Grant signed the Amnesty Act of 1872   edit  Grant  the Radical President Main article  Presidency of Ulysses S  Grant President Ulysses S  Grant 18th President of the United States 1869 1877 During the Civil War  many in the North believed that fighting for the Union was a noble cause   for the preservation of the Union and the end of slavery  After the war ended  with the North victorious  the fear among Radicals was that President Johnson too quickly assumed that slavery and Confederate nationalism were dead and that the southern states could return  The Radicals sought out a candidate for President who represented their viewpoint  88  In 1868  the Republicans unanimously chose Ulysses S  Grant to be the Republican Presidential candidate  Grant won favor with the Radicals after he allowed Edwin M  Stanton  a Radical  to be reinstated as Secretary of War  As early as 1862  during the Civil War  Grant had appointed the Ohio military chaplain John Eaton to protect and gradually incorporate refugee slaves in west Tennessee and northern Mississippi into the Union War effort  and pay them for their labor  It was the beginning of his vision for the Freedmen s Bureau  89  Grant opposed President Johnson by supporting the Reconstruction Acts passed by the Radicals  90  91  Immediately upon Inauguration in 1869  Grant bolstered Reconstruction by prodding Congress to readmit Virginia  Mississippi  and Texas into the Union  while ensuring their constitutions protected every citizens voting rights  92  Grant met with prominent black leaders for consultation  and signed a bill into law that guaranteed equal rights to both blacks and whites in Washington D C  92  In Grant s two terms he strengthened Washington s legal capabilities  He worked with Congress to create the Department of Justice and Office of Solicitor General  led by Attorney General Amos Akerman and the first Solicitor General Benjamin Bristow  who both prosecuted thousands of Klansmen under the Force Acts  Grant sent additional federal troops to nine South Carolina counties to suppress Klan violence in 1871  Grant also used military pressure to ensure that African Americans could maintain their new electoral status  won passage of the Fifteenth Amendment giving African Americans the right to vote  and signed the Civil Rights Act of 1875 giving people access to public facilities regardless of race  To counter vote fraud in the Democratic stronghold of New York City  Grant sent in tens of thousands of armed  uniformed federal marshals and other election officials to regulate the 1870 and subsequent elections  Democrats across the North then mobilized to defend their base and attacked Grant s entire set of policies  93  On October 21  1876 President Grant deployed troops to protect black and white Republican voters in Petersburg  Virginia  94  Grant s support from Congress and the nation declined due to presidential scandals during his administration and the political resurgence of the Democrats in the North and South  Furthermore most Republicans felt the war goals had been achieved by 1870 and turned their attention to other issues such as financial and monetary policies  95   edit  Congressional investigation  1871 1872  On April 20  1871  the U S  Congress launched a 21 member investigation committee on the status of the Southern Reconstruction states  North Carolina  South Carolina  Georgia  Mississippi  Alabama  and Florida  Congressional members on the committee included Rep  Benjamin Butler  Sen  Zachariah Chandler  and Sen  Francis P  Blair  Subcommittee members traveled into the South to interview the people living in their respective states  Those interviewed included top ranking officials  such as Wade Hampton  former South Carolina Gov  James L  Orr  and Nathan B  Forrest  a former Confederate general and prominent Ku Klux Klan leader  Others southerners interviewed included farmers  doctors  merchants  teachers  and clergymen  The committee heard numerous reports of white violence against blacks  while many whites denied Klan membership or knowledge of violent activities  The majority report by Republicans concluded that the government would not tolerate any Southern  conspiracy  to resist violently the Congressional Reconstruction  The committee completed its 13 volume report in February 1872  While Grant had been able to suppress the KKK through the Force Acts  other paramilitary insurgents organized  including the White League in 1874  active in Louisiana  and the Red Shirts  with chapters active in Mississippi and the Carolinas  They used intimidation and outright attacks to run Republicans out of office and repress voting by blacks  leading to white Democrats regaining power by the elections of the mid to late 1870s  96   edit

help the South advance in the postwar era  Others were free blacks before the war  who had achieved education and positions of leadership elsewhere  Other African American men who served were already

argued that the freedmen had a deep commitment to education and that African Americans in the Republican coalition played a critical role in establishing the principal of universal public education in state constitutions during congressional Reconstruction  103  Some slaves learned to read from white playmates although formal education was not allowed by law  African Americans started  native schools  before the end of the war  Sabbath schools were another widespread means freedmen created for teaching literacy  104  When they gained suffrage  black politicians took this commitment to public education to state constitutional conventions  African Americans and white Republicans joined to build education at the state level  They created a system of public schools  which were segregated by race everywhere except New Orleans  Generally  elementary and a few secondary schools were built in most cities  and occasionally in the countryside  but the South had few cities  In the rural areas the public school was often a one room affair that attracted about half the younger children  The teachers were poorly paid  and their pay was often in arrears  105  Conservatives contended the rural schools were too expensive and unnecessary for a region where the vast majority of people were cotton or tobacco farmers  They had no vision of a better future for their residents  One historian found that the schools were less effective than they might have been because  poverty  the inability of the states to collect taxes  and inefficiency and corruption in many places prevented successful operation of the schools   106  1868 Republican cartoon identifies Democratic candidate Horatio Seymour  right panel  with KKK violence and with Confederate soldiers Numerous private academies and colleges for freedmen were established by northern missionaries  Every state created state colleges for freedmen  such as Alcorn State University in Mississippi  The state colleges created generations of teachers who were critical in the education of African American children  In 1890  the black state colleges started receiving federal funds as land grant schools  They received state funds after Reconstruction ended because  as Lynch explains   there are very many liberal  fair minded and influential Democrats in the State who are strongly in favor of having the State provide for the liberal education of both races   107  108   edit  Railroad subsidies and payoffs Atlanta s railyard and roundhouse in ruins shortly after the end of the Civil War  Every Southern state subsidized railroads  which modernizers felt could haul the South out of isolation and poverty  Millions of dollars in bonds and subsidies were fraudulently pocketed  One ring in North Carolina spent  200 000 in bribing the legislature and obtained millions in state money for its railroads  Instead of building new track  however  it used the funds to speculate in bonds  reward friends with extravagant fees  and enjoy lavish trips to Europe  109  Taxes were quadrupled across the South to pay off the railroad bonds and the school costs  There were complaints among taxpayers  because taxes had historically been low  since there was so little commitment to public works or public education  Taxes historically had been much lower than in the North  reflecting a lack of public investment in the communities  110  Nevertheless thousands of miles of lines were built as the Southern system expanded from 11 000 miles  17 700 km  in 1870 to 29 000 miles  46 700 km  in 1890  The lines were owned and directed overwhelmingly by Northerners  Railroads helped create a mechanically skilled group of craftsmen and broke the isolation of much of the region  Passengers were few  however  and apart from hauling the cotton crop when it was harvested  there was little freight traffic  111  As Franklin explains   numerous railroads fed at the public trough by bribing legislators   and through the use and misuse of state funds   The effect  according to one businessman   was to drive capital from the State  paralyze industry  and demoralize labor   112   edit  Taxation during Reconstruction Reconstruction changed the tax structure of the South  In the U S  from the earliest days until today  a major source of state revenue was the property tax  In the South  wealthy landowners were allowed to self assess the value of their own land  These fraudulent assessments were almost valueless  and pre war property tax collections were lacking due to property value misrepresentation  State revenues came from fees and from sales taxes on slave auctions  113  Some states assessed property owners by a combination of land value and a capitation tax  a tax on each worker employed  This tax was often assessed in a way to discourage a free labor market  where a slave was assessed at 75 cents  while a free white was assessed at a dollar or more  and a free African American at  3 or more  Some revenue also came from poll taxes  These taxes were more than poor people could pay  with the designed and inevitable consequence that they did not vote  During Reconstruction  new spending on schools and infrastructure  combined with fraudulent spending and a collapse in state credit because of huge deficits  forced the states to dramatically increase property tax rates  In places  the rate went up to ten times higher despite the poverty of the region  The infrastructure of much of the South roads  bridges  and railroads scarce and deficient even before the war had been destroyed during the war  In addition  there were other new expenditures  because pre war southern states did not educate their citizens or build and maintain much infrastructure  In part  the new tax system was designed to force owners of large estates with huge tracts of uncultivated land either to sell or to have it confiscated for failure to pay taxes  114  The taxes would serve as a market based system for redistributing the land to the landless freedmen and white poor  Here is a table of property tax rates for South Carolina and Mississippi  Note that many local town and county assessments effectively doubled the tax rates reported in the table  These taxes were still levied upon the landowners  own sworn testimony as to the value of their land

concluded  The argument made by the taxpayers  however  was plausible and it may be conceded that  upon the whole  they were about right  for no doubt it would have been much easier upon the taxpayers to have increased at that time the interest bearing debt of the State than to have increased the tax rate  The latter course  however  had been adopted and could not then be changed  107   edit  Conservative Democrat reaction The fact that their former slaves now held political and military power angered many whites  They self consciously defended their own actions within the framework of an Anglo American discourse of resistance against tyrannical government  and they broadly succeeded in convincing fellow  white  citizens  116  They formed new political parties  often with the intention to contest elections   and supported or tolerated violent activist groups that intimidated both black and white Republican leaders at election time  By the mid 1870s  the Conservative Democrats had aligned with the national Democratic Party  which enthusiastically supported their cause even as the national Republican Party was losing interest in Southern affairs  Historian Walter Lynwood Fleming describes mounting anger of Southern whites  The Negro troops  even at their best  were everywhere considered offensive by the native whites    The Negro soldier  impudent by reason of his new freedom  his new uniform  and his new gun  was more than Southern temper could tranquilly bear  and race conflicts were frequent  117  Most  white  members of both the planter business class and common farmer class of the South opposed black power  Carpetbaggers and military rule  and sought white supremacy  Democrats nominated blacks for political office and tried to steal other blacks from the Republican side  When these attempts to combine with the blacks failed  the planters joined the common farmers in simply trying to displace the Republican governments  The planters and their business allies dominated the self styled  conservative  coalition that finally took control in the South  They were paternalistic toward the blacks but feared they would use power to raise taxes and slow business development  118  Fleming is a typical example of the conservative interpretation of Reconstruction  His work defended some roles in opposing military oppression by the white supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan  KKK  but denounced the Klan s violence  Fleming accepted as necessary the disenfranchisement of African Americans because he thought their votes were bought and sold by Carpetbaggers  Fleming described the first results of the movement as  good  and the later ones as  both good and bad   According to Fleming  1907  the KKK  quieted the Negroes  made life and property safer  gave protection to women  stopped burnings  forced the Radical leaders to be more moderate  made the Negroes work better  drove the worst of the Radical leaders from the country and started the whites on the way to gain political supremacy   The evil result  Fleming said  was that lawless elements  made use of the organization as a cloak to cover their misdeeds    the lynching habits of today  1907  are largely to conditions  social and legal  growing out of Reconstruction   119  Ellis Paxson Oberholtzer  a northern scholar  in 1917 explained  Outrages upon the former slaves in the South there were in plenty  Their sufferings were many  But white men  too  were victims of lawless violence  and in all portions of the North and the late  rebel  states  Not a political campaign passed without the exchange of bullets  the breaking of skulls with sticks and stones  the firing of rival club houses  Republican clubs marched the streets of Philadelphia  amid revolver shots and brickbats  to save the negroes from the  rebel  savages in Alabama    The project to make voters out of black men was not so much for their social elevation as for the further punishment of the Southern white people for the capture of offices for Radical scamps and the entrenchment of the Radical party in power for a long time to come in the South and in the country at large  120  Reaction by the angry whites included the formation of violent secret societies  especially the KKK  Violence occurred in cities with Democrats  Conservatives and other angry whites on one side and Republicans  African Americans  federal government representatives  and Republican organized armed Loyal Leagues on the other  The victims of this violence were overwhelmingly African American  The Klan and other such groups were careful to avoid federal legal intervention or military conflict  Their election time tactics included violent intimidation of African American and Republican voters prior to elections while avoiding conflict with the U S  Army or the state militias and then withdrawing completely on election day  Conservative reaction continued in both the north and south  the  white liners  movement to elect candidates dedicated to white supremacy reached as far as Ohio in 1875  121  122   edit  Redemption 1873 77  edit  Republicans split nationally  election of 1872 As early as 1868 Supreme Court Chief Justice Salmon P  Chase  a leading Radical during the war  concluded that  Congress was right in not limiting  by its reconstruction acts  the right of suffrage to whites  but wrong in the exclusion from suffrage of certain classes of citizens and all unable to take its prescribed retrospective oath  and wrong also in the establishment of despotic military governments for the States and in authorizing military commissions for the trial of civilians in time of peace  There should have been as little military government as possible  no military commissions  no classes excluded from suffrage  and no oath except one of faithful obedience and support to the Constitution and laws  and of sincere attachment to the constitutional Government of the United States  123  By 1872  President Ulysses S  Grant had alienated large numbers of leading Republicans  including many Radicals by the corruption of his administration and his use of federal soldiers to prop up Radical state regimes in the South  The opponents  called  Liberal Republicans   included founders of the party who expressed dismay that the party had succumbed to corruption  They were further wearied by the continued insurgent violence of whites against blacks in the South  especially around every election cycle  which demonstrated the war was not over and changes were fragile  Leaders included editors of some of the nation s most powerful newspapers  Charles Sumner  embittered by the corruption of the Grant administration  joined the new party  which nominated editor Horace Greeley  The badly organized Democratic party also supported Greeley  Grant made up for the defections by new gains among Union veterans and by strong support from the  Stalwart  faction of his party  which depended on his patronage   and the Southern Republican parties  Grant won with 55 6  of the vote to Greeley s 43 8   The Liberal Republican party vanished and many former supporters even former abolitionists abandoned the cause of Reconstruction  124   edit  Republican coalition splinters in South In the South  political racial tensions built up inside the Republican party as they were attacked by the Democrats  In 1868  Georgia Democrats  with support from some Republicans  expelled all 28 black Republican members clarification needed   arguing blacks were eligible to vote but not to hold office  In several states  the more conservative scalawags fought for control with the more radical carpetbaggers and usually lost  Thus  in Mississippi  the conservative faction led by scalawag James Lusk Alcorn was decisively defeated by the radical faction led by carpetbagger Adelbert Ames  The party lost support steadily as many scalawags left it  few recruits were acquired  Meanwhile  the freedmen were demanding a bigger share of the offices and patronage  thus squeezing out their carpetbagger allies  125  Finally  some of the more prosperous freedmen were joining the Democrats  as they were angered at the failure of the Republicans to help them acquire land  126  Although historians such as W  E  B  Du Bois looked for and celebrated a cross racial coalition of poor whites and blacks  such coalitions rarely formed in these years  Writing in 1915  former Congressman Lynch  recalling his experience as a black leader in Mississippi  explained that  While the colored men did not look with favor upon a political alliance with the poor whites  it must be admitted that  with very few exceptions  that class of whites did not seek  and did not seem to desire such an alliance  127  Lynch reported that poor whites resented the job competition from freedmen  Furthermore  the poor whites with a few exceptions  were less efficient  less capable  and knew less about matters of state and governmental administration than many of the former slaves   As a rule  therefore  the whites that came into the leadership of the Republican party between 1872 and 1875 were representatives of the most substantial families of the land  127   edit  Democrats try a  New Departure  A Republican Form of Government and No Domestic Violence by Thomas Nast A political cartoon about the  Wheeler  Compromise in Louisiana published in Harper s Weekly March 6  1875 By 1870  the Democratic Conservative leadership across the South decided it had to end its opposition to Reconstruction and black suffrage to survive and move on to new issues  The Grant administration had proven by its crackdown on the Ku Klux Klan that it would use as much federal power as necessary to suppress open anti black violence  The Democrats in the North concurred  They wanted to fight the Republican Party on economic grounds rather than race  The New Departure offered the chance for a clean slate without having to re fight the Civil War every election  Furthermore  many wealthy landowners thought they could control part of the newly enfranchised black electorate to their own advantage  Not all Democrats agreed  an insurgent element continued to resist Reconstruction no matter what  Eventually  a group called  Redeemers  took control of the party in the Southern states  128  They formed coalitions with conservative Republicans  including scalawags and carpetbaggers  emphasizing the need for economic modernization  Railroad building was seen as a panacea since northern capital was needed  The new tactics were a success in Virginia where William Mahone built a winning coalition  In Tennessee  the Redeemers formed a coalition with Republican governor DeWitt Senter  Across the South  some Democrats switched from the race issue to taxes and corruption  charging that Republican governments were corrupt and inefficient  With continuing decrease in cotton prices  taxes squeezed cash poor farmers who rarely saw  20 in currency a year but had to pay taxes in currency or lose their farm  In North Carolina  Republican Governor William Woods Holden used state troops against the Klan  but the prisoners were released by federal judges  Holden became the first governor in American history to be impeached and removed from office  Republican political disputes in Georgia split the party and enabled the Redeemers to take over  129  In the lower South  violence continued and new insurgent groups arose  The disputed election in Louisiana in 1872 found both Republican and Democratic candidates holding inaugural balls while returns were reviewed  Both certified their own slates for local parish offices in many places  causing local tensions to rise  Finally  Federal support helped certify the Republican as governor  but the Democrat Samuel D  McEnery in March 1873 brought his own militia to bear in New Orleans  the seat of government  Slates for local offices were certified by each candidate  In rural Grant Parish in the Red River Valley  freedmen fearing a Democratic attempt to take over the parish government reinforced defenses at the Colfax courthouse in late March  White militias gathered from the area a few miles outside the settlement  Rumors and fears abounded on both sides  William Ward  an African American Union veteran and militia captain  mustered his company in Colfax and went to the courthouse  On Easter Sunday  April 13  1873  the whites attacked the defenders at the courthouse  There was confusion about who shot one of the white leaders after an offer by the defenders to surrender  It was a catalyst to mayhem  In the end  three whites died and 120 150 blacks were killed  some 50 were held as prisoners  The disproportionate numbers of black to white fatalities and documentation of brutalized bodies are why contemporary historians call it the Colfax Massacre rather than the Colfax Riot  as it is known locally  130  This marked the beginning of heightened insurgency and attacks on Republican officeholders and freedmen in Louisiana and other Deep South states  In Louisiana  Judge T S  Crawford and District Attorney P H  Harris of the 12th Judicial District were shot off their horses and killed from ambush October 8  1873  while going to court  One widow wrote to the Department of Justice that her husband was killed because he was a Union man and     of the efforts made to screen those who committed a crime      131  In the North  a live and let live attitude made elections more like a sporting contest  But in the Deep South  many white citizens had not reconciled with the defeat of the war or the granting of citizenship to freedmen  As an Alabama scalawag explained  Our contest here is for life  for the right to earn our bread    for a decent and respectful consideration as human beings and members of society  132   edit  Panic of 1873 The Panic of 1873  a depression  hit the Southern economy hard and disillusioned many Republicans who had gambled that railroads would pull the South out of its poverty  The price of cotton fell by half  many small landowners  local merchants and cotton factors  wholesalers  went bankrupt  Sharecropping for black and white farmers became more common as a way to spread the risk of owning land  The old abolitionist element in the North was aging away  or had lost interest  and was not replenished  Many carpetbaggers returned to the North or joined the Redeemers  Blacks had an increased voice in the Republican Party  but across the South it was divided by internal bickering and was rapidly losing its cohesion  Many local black leaders started emphasizing individual economic progress in cooperation with white elites  rather than racial political progress in opposition to them  a conservative attitude that foreshadowed Booker T  Washington  133  Nationally  President Grant was blamed for the depression  the Republican Party lost 96 seats in all parts of the country in the 1874 elections  The Bourbon Democrats took control of the House and were confident of electing Samuel J  Tilden president in 1876  President Grant was not running for re election and seemed to be losing interest in the South  States fell to the Redeemers  with only four in Republican hands in 1873  Arkansas  Louisiana  Mississippi and South Carolina  Arkansas then fell after the violent Brooks Baxter War in 1874 ripped apart the Republican party there   edit  Paramilitary groups allied with Democratic Party In wide area of the South  secret societies sprang up with the aim of preventing blacks from voting and destroying the organization of the Republican party by assassinating local leaders and public officials  the most notorious such organization was the Ku Klux Klan  which in effect served as the military arm of the Democratic party in the south  it was led by planters  merchants and democratic politicians  men who liked to style themselves the South s  respectable citizens   Foner Give me liberty 504  Political violence had been endemic in Louisiana  but in 1874 the white militias coalesced into paramilitary organizations such as the White League  first in parishes of the Red River Valley  A new organization operated openly and had political goals  the violent overthrow of Republican rule and suppression of black voting  White League chapters soon rose in many rural parishes  receiving financing for advanced weaponry from wealthy men  In one example of local violence  the White League assassinated six white Republican officeholders and five to twenty black witnesses outside Coushatta  Red River Parish in 1874  Four of the white men were related to the Republican representative of the parish  134  Later in 1874 the White League mounted a serious attempt to unseat the Republican governor of Louisiana  in a dispute that had simmered since the 1872 election  It brought 5000 troops to New Orleans to engage and overwhelm forces of the Metropolitan Police and state militia to turn Republican Governor William P  Kellogg out of office and seat McEnery  The White League took over and held the state house and city hall  but they retreated before the arrival of reinforcing Federal troops  Kellogg had asked for reinforcements before  and Grant finally responded  sending additional troops to try to quell violence throughout plantation areas of the Red River Valley  although 2 000 troops were already in the state  135  Similarly  the Red Shirts  another paramilitary group  arose in 1875 in Mississippi and the Carolinas  Like the White League and White Liner rifle clubs  these groups operated as a  military arm of the Democratic Party   to restore white supremacy  136  Democrats and many northern Republicans agreed that Confederate nationalism and slavery were dead the war goals were achieved and further federal military interference was an undemocratic violation of historic Republican values  The victory of Rutherford Hayes in the hotly contested Ohio gubernatorial election of 1875 indicated his  let alone  policy toward the South would become Republican policy  as happened when he won the 1876 Republican nomination for president  An explosion of violence accompanied the campaign for the Mississippi s 1875 election  in which Red Shirts and Democratic rifle clubs  operating in the open and without disguise  threatened or shot enough Republicans to decide the election for the Democrats  Republican Governor Adelbert Ames asked Grant for federal troops to fight back  Grant initially refused  saying public opinion was  tired out  of the perpetual troubles in the South  Ames fled the state as the Democrats took over Mississippi  137  This was not the end of the violence  however  as the campaigns and elections of 1876 were marked by additional murders and attacks on Republicans in Louisiana  North and South Carolina  and Florida  In South Carolina the campaign season of 1876 was marked by murderous outbreaks and fraud against freedmen  Red Shirts paraded with arms behind Democratic candidates  they killed blacks in the Hamburg and Ellenton SC massacres  and one historian estimated 150 blacks were killed in the weeks before the 1876 election across South Carolina  Red Shirts prevented almost all black voting in two majority black counties  138  The Red Shirts were also active in North Carolina   edit  Election of 1876 Reconstruction continued in South Carolina  Louisiana and Florida until 1877  The elections of 1876 were accompanied by heightened violence across the Deep South  A combination of ballot stuffing and intimidating blacks suppressed their vote even in majority black counties  The White League was active in Louisiana  After Republican Rutherford Hayes won the disputed 1876 presidential election  the national Compromise of 1877 was reached  The white Democrats in the South agreed to accept Hayes s victory if he withdrew the last Federal troops  By this point  the North was weary of insurgency  White Democrats controlled most of the Southern legislatures and armed militias controlled small towns and rural areas  Blacks considered Reconstruction a failure because the Federal government withdrew from enforcing their ability to exercise their rights as citizens  139   edit  Hayes  the last Reconstruction President President Rutherford B  Hayes 19th President of the United States 1877 1881 On January 29  1877 President Ulysses S  Grant signed the Electoral Commission Act that set up a 15 member commission to settle the disputed 1876 election of 8 Republicans and 7 Democrats  The Electoral Commission awarded Rutherford B  Hayes the electoral votes he needed  Congress certified he had won by one electoral vote  The Democrats had little leverage they could not block Hayes  election  but they were mollified by the implicit   back room  deal that federal troops would be removed on the condition that the Southern states pledged to protect the lives of African Americans  Hayes s friends also let it be known that he would promote Federal aid for internal improvements  including help for a railroad in Texas  and name a Southerner to his cabinet  With the removal of Northern troops  the President had no method to enforce Reconstruction  thus this  back room  deal signaled the end of American Reconstruction  140  After assuming office on March 4  1877  President Hayes removed troops from the capitals of the remaining Reconstruction states  Louisiana and South Carolina  allowing the Redeemers to have full control of these states  President Grant had already removed troops from Florida  before Hayes was inaugurated  and troops from the other Reconstruction states had long since been withdrawn  Hayes also appointed David M  Key from Tennessee  a Southern Democrat  to the position of Postmaster General  By 1879  thousands of African American  exodusters  packed up and headed to new opportunities in Kansas  141  The Democrats gained control of the Senate  and now had complete control of Congress having already taken over the House in 1875  Hayes vetoed bills from the Democrats that outlawed the Republican Force Acts  however  with the military underfunded  Hayes could not adequately enforce these laws  Blacks remained involved in Southern politics  particularly in Virginia  which was run by the biracial Readjuster Party  142   edit  Legacy and historiography The interpretation of Reconstruction has swung back and forth several times  Nearly all historians hold that Reconstruction ended in failure  It is hard to see Reconstruction  as concluding in anything but failure  says Etcheson  2009  143  Etcheson adds   W  E  B  DuBois captured that failure well when he wrote in Black Reconstruction in America  1935    The slave went free  stood a brief moment in the sun  then moved back again toward slavery    Likewise Eric Foner concludes that from the black point of view   Reconstruction must be judged a failure   144  Foner stated Reconstruction was  a noble if flawed experiment  the first attempt to introduce a genuine inter racial democracy in the United States   67  The many factors contributing to Reconstruction failure include  lack of a permanent federal agency specifically designed for the enforcement of civil rights  the Morrison R  Waite Supreme Court decisions that dismantled previous congressional civil rights legislation  and the economic reestablishment of conservative white planters in the South by 1877  Historian William McFeely explained that although the constitutional amendments and civil rights legislation on their own merit were remarkable achievements no permanent government agency whose specific purpose was civil rights enforcement had been created  145  The first generation of Northern historians believed that the former Confederates were traitors and Johnson was their ally who threatened to undo the Union s constitutional achievements  By the 1880s  however  Northern historians argued that Johnson and his allies were not traitors but blundered badly in rejecting the 14th Amendment and setting the stage for Radical Reconstruction  146  The black leader Booker T  Washington  who grew up in West Virginia during Reconstruction  concluded that   the Reconstruction experiment in racial democracy failed because it began at the wrong end  emphasizing political means and civil rights acts rather than economic means and self determination   147  His solution was to concentrate on building the economic infrastructure of the black community  in part by his leadership of Tuskegee Institute  In popular literature two novels by Thomas Dixon The Clansman  1905  and The Leopard s Spots  A Romance of the White Man s Burden   1865 1900  1902  romanticized white resistance to Northern black coercion  hailing vigilante action by the KKK  Other authors romanticized the benevolence of slavery and the happy world of the antebellum plantation  These sentiments were expressed on the screen in D W  Griffith s anti Republican 1915 movie The Birth of a Nation  Joel Chandler Harris was particularly instrumental in swaying southern opinion to support the Union  His literary works  as well as his role as the editor of the Atlanta Constitution  helped persuade other southerners that they should embrace Reconstruction and Northern influence and infrastructures  Ultimately  it was these sorts of ideas  in conjunction with popular literature  that spawned several romantic stories about Lincoln s role as a hero in the south  This lost hero  separated by death from the realities of slavery in the Confederacy and the stark truths faced by the South following the end of the Civil War  was made out by some to be exactly what the south needed  Through this logic  white supremacists could both embrace the positive changes offered by the north as well as continue to believe that had Lincoln survived  he would have permitted the oppression of African Americans  148  The Dunning School of scholars based at the history department of Columbia University analyzed Reconstruction as a failure  at least after 1866  for different reasons  They claimed that it took freedoms and rights from qualified whites and gave them to unqualified blacks who were being duped by corrupt carpetbaggers and scalawags  As T  Harry Williams  who was not a member of the Dunning school  notes  the Dunningites portrayed the era in stark terms   Reconstruction was a battle between two extremes  the Democrats  as the group which included the vast majority of the whites  standing for decent government and racial supremacy  versus the Republicans  the Negroes  alien carpetbaggers  and renegade scalawags  standing for dishonest government and alien ideals  These historians wrote literally in terms of white and black   149  In the 1930s  revisionism became popular among scholars  As disciples of Charles A  Beard  revisionists focused on economics  downplaying politics and constitutional issues  They argued that the Radical rhetoric of equal rights was mostly a smokescreen hiding the true motivation of Reconstruction s real backers  Howard K  Beale argued that Reconstruction was primarily a successful attempt by financiers  railroad builders and industrialists in the Northeast  using the Republican Party  to control the national government for their own selfish economic ends  Those ends were to continue the wartime high protective tariff  the new network of national banks and to guarantee a sound currency  To succeed  the business class had to remove the old ruling agrarian class of Southern planters and Midwestern farmers  This it did by inaugurating Reconstruction  which made the South Republican  and by selling its policies to the voters wrapped up in such attractive vote getting packages as Northern patriotism or the bloody shirt  Historian William Hesseltine added the point that the Northeastern businessmen wanted to control the South economically  which they did through ownership of the railroads  150  However  historians in the 1950s and 1960s refuted Beale s economic causation by demonstrating that Northern businessmen were widely divergent on monetary or tariff policy  and seldom paid attention to Reconstruction issues  151  The black scholar W  E  B  Du Bois  in his Black Reconstruction in America  1860 1880  published in 1935  compared results across the states to show achievements by the Reconstruction legislatures and to refute claims about wholesale African American control of governments  He showed black contributions  as in the establishment of universal public education  charitable and social institutions and universal suffrage as important results  and he noted their collaboration with whites  He also pointed out that whites benefited most by the financial deals made  and he put excesses in the perspective of the war s aftermath  He noted that despite complaints  several states kept their Reconstruction constitutions for nearly a quarter of a century  Despite receiving favorable reviews  his work was largely ignored by white historians  In the 1960s neoabolitionist historians emerged  led by John Hope Franklin  Kenneth Stampp and Eric Foner  Influenced by the Civil Rights Movement  they rejected the Dunning school and found a great deal to praise in Radical Reconstruction  Foner  the primary advocate of this view  argued that it was never truly completed  and that a Second Reconstruction was needed in the late 20th century to complete the goal of full equality for African Americans  The neo abolitionists followed the revisionists in minimizing the corruption and waste created by Republican state governments  saying it was no worse than Boss Tweed s ring in New York City  152  Instead  they emphasized that suppression of the rights of African Americans was a worse scandal and a grave corruption of America s republican ideals  They argued that the tragedy of Reconstruction was not that it failed because blacks were incapable of governing  especially as they did not dominate any state government  but that it failed because whites raised an insurgent movement to restore white supremacy  White elite dominated state legislatures passed disfranchising constitutions from 1890 to 1908 that effectively barred most blacks and many poor whites from voting  This disfranchisement affected millions of people for decades into the 20th century  and closed African Americans and poor whites out of the political process in the South  153  154  Re establishment of white supremacy meant that within a decade white people forgot that blacks were creating thriving middle classes in many states of the South  African Americans  lack of representation meant that they were treated as second class citizens  with schools and services consistently underfunded in segregated societies  no representation on juries or in law enforcement  and bias in other legislation  It was not until the Civil Rights Movement and the passage of Federal legislation that African Americans regained their suffrage and civil rights in the South  under what is sometimes referred to as the  Second Reconstruction   More recent work by Nina Silber  David W  Blight  Cecelia O Leary  Laura Edwards  LeeAnn Whites and Edward J  Blum  has encouraged greater attention to race  religion and issues of gender while at the same time pushing the end of Reconstruction to the end of the 19th century  while monographs by Charles Reagan Wilson  Gaines Foster  W  Scott Poole and Bruce Baker have offered new views of the Southern  Lost Cause   155  While 1877 is the usual date given for the end of Reconstruction  some historians extend the era to the 1890s  156  Reconstruction is unanimously considered a failure  though the reason for this is a matter of controversy  The Dunning School considered failure inevitable because they felt that taking the power away from Southern whites was a violation of republicanism  A second school sees the reason for failure as Northern Republicans  lack of effectiveness in guaranteeing political rights to blacks  A third school blames the failure of not giving land to the freedmen so they could have their own economic base of power  A fourth school sees the major reason for failure of reconstruction as the states  inability to suppress the violence of Southern whites when they sought reversal for blacks  gains  Etcheson  2009  points to the  violence that crushed black aspirations and the abandonment by Northern whites of Southern Republicans   157  Other historians emphasize the failure to fully incorporate Southern Unionists in the Republican coalition  158   edit  Reconstruction state by state   significant dates Only Georgia has a separate article about its experiences under Reconstruction  The other state names below link to
