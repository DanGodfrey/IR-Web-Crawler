 4 Gilbertese    ki ibas    officially the Republic of Kiribati  is an island nation located in the central tropical Pacific Ocean  The permanent population is just over 100 000  2011   5  and the island nation is composed of 32 atolls and one raised coral island  dispersed over 3 5 million square kilometres   1 351 000 square miles  straddling the equator  and bordering the International Date Line at its easternmost point  The name Kiribati is the local pronunciation of  Gilberts   derived from the main island chain  the Gilbert Islands  The capital of South Tarawa consists of a number of islets connected through a series of causeways  located in the Tarawa archipelago  Kiribati became independent from the United Kingdom in 1979  It is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations  the IMF and the World Bank  and became a full member of the United Nations in 1999  Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 2 1 Early history 2 2 Colonial era 2 3 Independence to present day 3 Politics 4 Island groups

European name the  Gilbert Islands   Although the indigenous Gilbertese language name for the Gilbert Islands proper is Tungaru  the new state chose the name  Kiribati   the Gilbertese rendition of  Gilberts   as an equivalent of the former colony to acknowledge the inclusion of islands which were never considered part of the Gilberts chain  7   edit  History American marines assault a Japanese

Kiribati has been inhabited by Micronesians speaking the same Oceanic language since sometime between 3000 BC 8  and AD 1300  The area was not isolated  invaders from Tonga  Samoa  and Fiji later introduced Polynesian and Melanesian cultural aspects  respectively  Intermarriage tended to blur cultural differences and resulted in a significant degree of cultural homogenisation  9   edit  Colonial era The islands were first sighted by British and American ships in the late 18th and early 19th centuries  The main island chain was named the Gilbert Islands in 1820 by a Russian admiral  Adam von Krusenstern  and French captain Louis Duperrey  after a British captain named Thomas Gilbert  who crossed the archipelago in 1788 when sailing from Australia to China  10  From the early 19th century  Western whalers  merchant vessels and slave traders visited the islands  introducing diseases and firearms  11  The first British settlers arrived in 1837  In 1892 the Gilbert Islands consented to become a British protectorate together with the nearby Ellice Islands  They were administered by the Western Pacific High Commission based in Fiji  10  Together they became the crown colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands in 1916  Christmas Island  or Kiritimati  became part of the colony in 1919 and the Phoenix Islands were added in 1937  Sir Arthur Grimble was a cadet administrative officer based at Tarawa  1913 1919  and became Resident Commissioner of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony in 1926  12  Tarawa Atoll and others of the Gilbert group were occupied by Japan during World War II  Tarawa was the site of one of the bloodiest battles in US Marine Corps history  Marines landed in November 1943  the Battle of Tarawa was fought at Kiribati s former capital Betio on Tarawa Atoll  Some of the islands of Kiribati  especially in the remote Line Islands  were formerly used by the United States and United Kingdom for nuclear weapons testing including hydrogen bombs in the late 1950s and early 1960s   edit  Independence to present day The Gilbert and Ellice Islands gained self rule in 1971  and were separated in 1975 and granted internal self government by Britain  In 1978 the Ellice Islands became the independent nation of Tuvalu  The Gilbert Islands became independent as Kiribati on 12 July 1979  Although the indigenous Gilbertese language name for the Gilbert Islands proper is  Tungaru   the new state chose the name  Kiribati   the Gilbertese rendition of  Gilberts   as an equivalent of the former colony to acknowledge the inclusion of Banaba  the Line Islands  and the Phoenix Islands  which were never considered part of the Gilberts chain  13  In the Treaty of Tarawa  signed shortly after independence and ratified in 1983  the United States relinquished all claims to the sparsely inhabited Phoenix Islands and those of the Line Islands that are part of Kiribati territory  Overcrowding has been a problem  In 1988 it was announced that 4 700 residents of the main island group would be resettled onto less populated islands  Teburoro Tito was elected president in 1994  Kiribati s 1995 act of moving the international date line far to the east to encompass the Line Islands group  so that it would no longer be divided by the date line  courted controversy  The move  which fulfilled one of President Tito s campaign promises  was intended to allow businesses all across the expansive nation to keep the same business week  This also enabled Kiribati to become the first country to see the dawn of the third millennium  an event of significance for tourism  Tito was reelected in 1998  Kiribati gained UN membership in 1999  14  In 2002 Kiribati passed a controversial law enabling the government to shut down newspapers  The legislation followed the launching of Kiribati s first successful nongovernment run newspaper  President Tito was reelected in 2003  but was removed from office in March 2003 by a no confidence vote and replaced by a Council of State  Anote Tong of the opposition party Boutokaan Te Koaua was elected to succeed Tito in July 2003  He was re elected in 2007  15  In June 2008  Kiribati officials asked Australia and New Zealand to accept Kiribati citizens as permanent refugees  Kiribati is expected to be the first country in which all land territory disappears due to global climate change  In June 2008  the Kiribati president Anote Tong said that the country has reached  the point of no return   he added   To plan for the day when you no longer have a country is indeed painful but I think we have to do that   16  17  18  19  As sea levels continue to rise  the government of Kiribati is negotiating a deal with Fiji to evacuate the entire population to areas of Fiji that the Kiribati government would buy  The area of Fiji proposed for resettlement is the second largest Fijian island of Vanua Levu  The mass migration is expected to include younger  skilled workers first  and then the rest of the population would follow over a period of years  20  21   edit  Politics Main article  Politics of Kiribati Kiribati Parliament House  The Presidential residence  The Kiribati Constitution  promulgated 12 July 1979  provides for free and open elections  The executive branch consists of a president  te Beretitenti   a vice president and a cabinet  the president is also chief of the cabinet and has to be an MP   Under the constitution  the president  nominated from among the elected legislators  is limited to three 4 year terms  The cabinet is composed of the president  vice president and 10 ministers  appointed by the president  who are members of the House of Assembly  The legislative branch is the unicameral Maneaba Ni Maungatabu  House of Assembly   It has elected members  including by constitutional mandate a representative of the Banaban people in Fiji  Banaba Island  former Ocean Island   in addition to the attorney general  who serves as an ex officio member  Legislators serve for a four year term  The constitutional provisions governing administration of justice are similar to those in other former British possessions in that the judiciary is free from governmental interference  The judicial branch is made up of the High Court  in Betio  and the Court of Appeal  The president appoints the presiding judges  Local government is through island councils with elected members  Local affairs are handled in a manner similar to town meetings in colonial America  Island councils make their own estimates of revenue and expenditure and generally are free from central government controls  Kiribati has formal political parties but their organisation is quite informal  Ad hoc opposition groups tend to coalesce around specific issues  Today the only recognisable parties are the Boutokaan te Koaua Party  Maneaban te Mauri Party  Maurin Kiribati Party and Tabomoa Party  There is universal suffrage at age 18  In government terms  Kiribati has a police force  which carries out law enforcement functions and paramilitary duties  and which has small police posts on all islands  but no military  The police have one patrol boat  22   edit  Island groups Main article  Districts of Kiribati Kiribati was formally divided into districts until its independence  The country is now divided into three island groups which have no

 Starbuck Island  Caroline Island  Vostok Island and Flint Island   The Phoenix Islands are uninhabited except for Kanton  and have no representation  Banaba itself is sparsely inhabited now  There is also a non elected representative of the Banabans on Rabi Island in Fiji  Each of the 21 inhabited islands has a local council that takes care of the daily affairs  Tarawa Atoll has three councils  Betio Town Council  Te Inainano Urban Council  for the rest of South Tarawa  and Eutan Tarawa Council  for North Tarawa    edit  Foreign relations Main article  Foreign relations of Kiribati Kiribati was admitted as the 186th member of the United Nations in September 1999   edit  Regional relations Kiribati maintains cordial relations with most countries and has close relations with its Pacific neighbours  Japan  Australia and New Zealand  which provide the majority of the country s foreign aid  Taiwan and Japan also have specified period licences to fish in Kiribati s waters  citation

needed  The agreement stipulated that Japan was to pay US 840 000 per year and would also pay for any damage to roads and the environment  A Japanese built downrange tracking station operates on Kiritimati 25  and an abandoned airfield on the island was designated as the landing strip for a proposed reusable unmanned space shuttle called HOPE X  HOPE X  however  was eventually cancelled by Japan in 2003  citation needed   edit  International relations of climate change As one of the world s most vulnerable nations in terms of the effects of climate change  Kiribati has been an active participant in international diplomatic efforts relating to climate change  most importantly the UNFCCC conferences of the parties  COP   Kiribati is a member of the Alliance of Small Island States  AOSIS   an intergovernmental organization of low lying coastal and small Island countries  Established in 1990  the main purpose of the alliance is to consolidate the voices of Small Island Developing States  SIDS  to address global warming  AOSIS has been very active from its inception  putting forward the first draft text in the Kyoto Protocol negotiations as early as 1994  In 2009  President Tong attended the Climate Vulnerable Forum  V11  in the Maldives  along with 10 other countries that are vulnerable to climate change  and signed the Bandos Island declaration on Nov  10 2009  pledging to show moral leadership and commence greening their economies by voluntarily committing to achieving carbon neutrality  In November 2010  Kiribati hosted the Tarawa Climate Change Conference  TCCC   the purpose of which was to support the initiative of the President of Kiribati to hold a consultative forum between vulnerable states and their partners with a view of creating an enabling environment for multi party negotiations under the auspices of the UNFCCC  The conference was a successor event to the Climate Vulnerable Forum  26  The ultimate objective of TCCC was to reduce the number and intensity of various fault lines between parties to the COP process  explore elements of agreement between the parties and thereby to support Kiribati s and other parties  contribution to COP16 held in Cancun  Mexico  from 29 November to 10 December 2010  In 2012  the government began negotiating with Fiji to buy land in to which it could move some of its population due to rising sea levels  27   edit  Geography Main article  Geography of Kiribati Map of Kiribati  Kiribati consists of about 32 atolls and one solitary island  Banaba   extending into both the eastern and western hemispheres  The groups of islands are  Banaba  an isolated island between Nauru and the Gilbert Islands Gilbert Islands  16 atolls located some 1 500 kilometres  932 mi  north of Fiji Phoenix Islands  8 atolls and coral islands located some 1 800 kilometres  1 118 mi  southeast of the Gilberts Line Islands  8 atolls and one reef  located about 3 300 kilometres  2 051 mi  east of the Gilberts Banaba  or Ocean Island  is a raised coral island which was once a rich source of phosphates  but it was mostly mined out before independence  The rest of the land in Kiribati consists of the sand and reef rock islets of atolls or coral islands which rise but a few metres  half a dozen feet or so  above sea level  The soil is thin and calcareous  making agriculture very difficult  Kiritimati  Christmas Island  in the Line Islands is the world s largest atoll  Based on a 1995 realignment of the International Date Line  Kiribati is now the easternmost country in the world  and the Line Islands are the first area to enter into a new year  including year 2000  For that reason  Caroline Island has been renamed Millennium Island  28  The majority of Kiribati  including the capital  is not first  for example New Zealand  UTC 13 in January  has an earlier new year  According to the Pacific Regional Environment Programme  previously South Pacific Regional Environment Programme  SPREP    two small uninhabited Kiribati islets  Tebua Tarawa and Abanuea  disappeared underwater in 1999  29  The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that sea levels will rise by about half a metre  20 in  by 2100 due to global warming and a further rise would be inevitable  It is thus likely that within a century the nation s arable land will become subject to increased soil salination and will be largely submerged  30  However  sea level rise may not necessarily mean Kiribati will be inundated  Paul Kench at the University of Auckland in New Zealand and Arthur Webb at the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission in Fiji released a study in 2010 on the dynamic response of reef islands to sea level rise in the central Pacific  Kiribati was mentioned in the study  and Webb and Kench found that the three major urbanised islands in Kiribati   Betio  Bairiki and Nanikai   increased by 30 per cent  36 hectares   16 3 per cent  5 8 hectares  and 12 5 per cent  0 8 hectares   respectively  31  The Kiribati Adaptation Program  KAP  is a US  5 5 million initiative that was originally enacted by the national government of Kiribati with the support of the Global Environment Facility  GEF   the World Bank  the United Nations Development Program  and the Japanese Government  Australia later joined the coalition  donating US  1 5 million to the effort  The program aims to take place over 6 years  supporting measures that reduce Kiribati s vulnerability to the effects of climate change and sea level rise by raising awareness of climate change  assessing and protecting available water resources  and managing inundation  At the start of the Adaptation Program  representatives from each of the inhabited atolls identified key climatic changes that had taken place over the past 20 40 years  and proposed coping mechanisms to deal with these changes under 4 categories of urgency of need  The program is now focusing on the country s most vulnerable sectors in the most highly populated areas  Initiatives include improving water supply management in and around Tarawa  coastal management protection measures such as mangrove re plantation and protection of public infrastructure  strengthening laws to reduce coastal erosion  and population settlement planning to reduce personal risks  32  Kiribati is the only country in all four hemispheres  33   edit  Economy Main article  Economy of Kiribati A Bosj s warehouse in Kiribati  Kiribati is one of the world s poorest countries  It has few natural resources  Commercially viable phosphate deposits on Banaba were exhausted at the time of independence  Copra and fish now represent the bulk of production and exports  Kiribati is considered one of the least developed countries in the world  In one form or another  Kiribati gets a large portion of its income from abroad  Examples include fishing licenses  development assistance  worker remittances  and tourism  Given Kiribati s limited domestic production ability  it must import nearly all of its essential foodstuffs and manufactured items  it depends on these external sources of income for financing  The economy of Kiribati benefits from international development assistance programs  The multilateral donors providing development assistance in 2009 were the European Union  A 9 million   the United Nations Development Program  A 3 7 million   and the World Health Organisation  A 100 000   34  The bilateral donors providing development assistance in 2009 were Australia  A 11 million   Japan  A 2 million   New Zealand  A 6 6 million   Taiwan  A 10 6 million   and other donors providing A 16 2 million  including technical assistance grants from the Asian Development Bank  5  34  The major donors in 2010 2011 were Australia  A 15 million   Taiwan  A 11 million   New Zealand  A 6 million   the World Bank  A 4 million   and the Asian Development Bank  35  In 1956 Kiribati established a sovereign wealth fund to act as a store of wealth for the country s earnings from phosphate mining  In 2008  the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund was valued at US  400 million  36  The RERF assets declined from A 637 million  420 percent of GDP  in 2007 to A 570 5 million  350 percent of GDP  in 2009  34  As the result of the Global Financial Crisis  GFC  the RERF was exposed to failed Icelandic banks  as well drawdowns were made by the government of Kiribati to finance budgetary shortfalls  5  In May 2011 the IMF country report assessment of the Economy of Kiribati is that   After two years of contraction  the economy recovered in the second half of 2010 and inflation pressure dissipated  It is estimated to have grown by 1  percent for the year  Despite a weather related drop in copra production  private sector activity appears to have picked up  especially in retail  Tourist arrivals rebounded by 20 percent compared to 2009  although from a very low base  Despite the rise in world food and fuel prices  inflation has bounced from 2008 crisis highs into negative territory  reflecting the strong appreciation of the Australian dollar  which is used as the domestic currency  and a decline in the world price of rice  Credit growth in the overall economy declined in 2009 as economic activity stalled  But it started to pick up in the second half of 2010 as the recovery gained traction   5   edit  Demographics Main article  Demographics of Kiribati The native people of Kiribati are called I Kiribati  The word Kiribati is the local spelling of the word Gilbert and the original name of this British colony was the Gilbert Islands  The indigenous format of the name was adopted when independence was gained in 1979  Ethnically  the I Kiribati are Micronesians  Recent archaeological evidence indicates that Austronesians originally settled the islands thousands of years ago  Around the 14th century  Fijians  Samoans  and Tongans invaded the islands  thus diversifying the ethnic range and introducing Polynesian linguistic traits  Intermarriage among all ancestral groups  however  has led to a population reasonably homogeneous in appearance and traditions  The people of Kiribati speak an Oceanic language called  Gilbertese   Although English is the official language  it is not used very often outside the island capital of Tarawa  It is more likely that English is mixed in its use with Gilbertese  Older generations of I Kiribati tend to use more complicated versions of the language  Christianity is the major religion  having been introduced by missionaries in the 19th century  The population is predominantly Roman Catholic  although a substantial portion of the population is Congregationalist Protestant  Many other Protestant denominations  including more evangelical types  are also represented  The Bah    religion also exists in Kiribati  along with Jehovah s Witnesses and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints  Mormons   the latter numbering 11 511 at the end of 2005  37   edit  Human development The Kiribati Census in 2010 estimated the population at 103 500  The people of Kiribati mostly live in villages with populations between 50 and 3 000 on the outer islands  Most houses are made of materials obtained from coconut and pandanus trees  Frequent droughts hinder reliable large scale agriculture  so the islanders have largely turned to the sea for livelihood and subsistence  Most are outrigger sailors and fishermen  Copra plantations serve as a second source of employment  In recent years  large numbers of citizens have moved to the more urban island capital of Tarawa  5   edit  Health The population of Kiribati has a life expectancy at birth of 60 years  57 for males  and 63 for females  and an infant mortality rate of 54 deaths per 1 000 live births  5 Tuberculosis is present in the country  38  Government expenditure on health was at US 268 per capita  PPP  in 2006  39  In 1990 2007  there were 23 physicians per 100 000 persons  40  Since the arrival of Cuban doctors  the infant mortality rate has decreased significantly  41   edit  Education Primary education is free and compulsory for the first six years  now being extended to nine years  Mission schools are slowly being absorbed into the government primary school system  Higher education is expanding  students may seek technical  teacher or marine training  or study in other countries  To date  most choosing to do the latter have gone to Fiji  and those wishing to complete medical training have been sent to Cuba  42   edit  Transport Bonriki International Airport Bonriki International Airport Main article  List of airports in Kiribati Beginning in January 2009  Kiribati has two domestic airlines  Air Kiribati and Coral Sun Airways  Both airlines are based in Tarawa s Bonriki International Airport and serve destinations across the Gilbert Islands only  Neither the Phoenix nor Line Islands are served by the domestic carriers  Fiji s national carrier Air Pacific provides an international service to Cassidy International Airport on Kiritimati from Fiji s main airport  Nadi International Airport  Internationally  Our Airline  the national airline of Nauru  also provides a weekly service on behalf of Air Kiribati from Tarawa to Nadi International Airport  as well as a service to Nauru International Airport  connecting to Honiara  the capital of the Solomon Islands  and further to Brisbane  Australia   edit  Culture Main article  Culture of Kiribati Songs  te anene  and above all dances  te mwaie  are held in high regard   edit  Music Main article  Music of Kiribati Kiribati folk music is generally based on chanting or other forms of vocalising  accompanied by body percussion  Public performances in modern Kiribati are generally performed by a seated chorus  accompanied by a guitar  However  during formal performances of the standing dance  Te Kaimatoa  or the hip dance  Te Buki  a wooden box is used as a percussion instrument  This box is constructed so as to give a hollow and reverberating tone when struck simultaneously by a chorus of men sitting around it  Traditional songs are often love themed  but there are also competitive  religious  children s  patriotic  war and wedding songs citation needed   There are also stick dances  which accompany legends and semi historical stories citation needed   These stick dances or  tirere   pronounced seerere  are only performed during major festivals   edit  Dance Main article  Dance in Kiribati A welcome display The uniqueness of Kiribati when compared with other forms of Pacific island dance is its emphasis on the outstretched arms of the dancer and the sudden birdlike movement of the head  The Frigate bird  Fregata minor  on the Kiribati flag refers to this bird like style of Kiribati dancing  Most dances are in the standing or sitting position with movement limited and staggered  Smiling whilst dancing is generally considered vulgar within the context of Kiribati dancing  This is due to its origin of not being solely as a form of entertainment but as a form of storytelling and a display of the skill  beauty and endurance of the dancer  43
