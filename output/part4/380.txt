typically meet four criteria  3  4  Publicity  Its contents are reasonably accessible to the public  Periodicity  It is published at regular intervals  Currency  Its information is up to date  Universality  It covers a range of topics   edit  History  edit  Gazettes and bulletins In China  early government produced news sheets  called tipao  circulated among court officials during the late Han dynasty  second and third centuries AD   Between 713 and 734  the Kaiyuan Za Bao   Bulletin of the Court   of the Chinese Tang Dynasty published government news  it was handwritten on silk and read by government officials  In 1582  there was the first reference to privately published newssheets in Beijing  during the late Ming Dynasty  5  In Ancient Rome  Acta Diurna  or government announcement bulletins  were produced  They were carved in metal or stone and posted in public places  In Early modern Europe the increased cross border interaction created a rising need for information which was met by concise handwritten newssheets  In 1556  the government of Venice first published the monthly Notizie scritte  which cost one gazetta  6  These avvisi were handwritten newsletters and used to convey political  military  and economic news quickly and efficiently to Italian cities  1500 1700    sharing some characteristics of newspapers though usually not considered true newspapers  7  However  none of these publications fully met the classical criteria for proper newspapers  as they were typically not intended for the general public and restricted to a certain range of topics   edit  Newspapers Main article  History of newspapers and magazines See also  List of the earliest newspapers  edit  Europe See also  History of British newspapers Title page of Carolus  Relation from 1609  the earliest newspaper The emergence of the new media branch in the 17th century has to be seen in close connection with the spread of the printing press from which the publishing press derives its name  8  The German language Relation aller F rnemmen und gedenckw rdigen Historien  printed from 1605 onwards by Johann Carolus in Strasbourg  is often recognized as the first newspaper  9  10  At the time  Strasbourg was a free imperial city in the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation  the first newspaper of modern Germany was the Avisa  published in 1609 in Wolfenb ttel  Other early papers include  The Dutch Courante uyt Italien  Duytslandt   amp c    Courant from Italy  Germany  etc    of 1618 was the first to appear in folio  rather than quarto size  Amsterdam  a center of world trade  quickly became home to newspapers in many languages  often before they were published in their own country  11  The first English language newspaper  Corrant out of Italy  Germany  etc   was published in Amsterdam in 1620  A year and a half later  Corante  or weekely newes from Italy  Germany  Hungary  Poland  Bohemia  France and the Low Countreys  was published in England by an  N B    generally thought to be either Nathaniel Butter or Nicholas Bourne  and Thomas Archer  12  The first newspaper in France was published in 1631  La Gazette  originally published as Gazette de France   6  The first newspaper in Portugal  Gazeta  was published in 1641 in Lisbon  13  The first Spanish newspaper  Gaceta de Madrid  was published in 1661  Post  och Inrikes Tidningar  founded as Ordinari Post Tijdender  was first published in Sweden in 1645  and is the oldest newspaper still in existence  though it now publishes solely online  14  Opregte Haarlemsche Courant from Haarlem  first published in 1656  is the oldest paper still printed  It was forced to merge with the newspaper Haarlems Dagblad in 1942 when Germany occupied the Netherlands  Since then the Haarlems Dagblad has appeared with the subtitle Oprechte Haerlemse Courant 1656  Merkuriusz Polski Ordynaryjny was published in Krak w  Poland in 1661  The first successful English daily  The Daily Courant  was published from 1702 to 1735  11  15   edit  Americas Diario de Pernambuco  founded in 1825 is the first newspaper in South America  See also  History of American newspapers In Boston in 1690  Benjamin Harris published Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick  This is considered the first newspaper in the American colonies even though only one edition was published before the paper was suppressed by the government  In 1704  the governor allowed The Boston News Letter to be published and it became the first continuously published newspaper in the colonies  Soon after  weekly papers began publishing in New York and Philadelphia  These early newspapers followed the British format and were usually four pages long  They mostly carried news from Britain and content depended on the editor s interests  In 1783  the Pennsylvania Evening Post became the first American daily  In 1752  John Bushell published the Halifax Gazette  the first Canadian newspaper  The first newspaper in South America was Diario de Pernambuco  established in 1825  By 2007  there were 1 456 daily newspapers in the U S   selling 55 million copies a day  16   edit  Asia

the early 19th century  many cities in Europe  as well as North and South America  published newspaper type publications though not all of them developed in the same way  content was vastly shaped by regional and cultural preferences  17  Advances in printing technology related to the Industrial Revolution enabled newspapers to become an even more widely circulated means of communication  In 1814  The Times  London  acquired a printing press capable of making 1 100 impressions per minute  18  Soon  it was adapted to print on both sides of a page at once  This innovation made newspapers cheaper and thus available to a larger part of the population  In 1830  the first penny press newspaper came to the market  Lynde M  Walter s Boston Transcript  19  Penny press papers cost about one sixth the price of other newspapers and appealed to a wider audience  20  In France   mile de Girardin started  La Presse  in 1836  introducing cheap  advertising supported dailies to France  In 1848  August Zang  an Austrian who knew Girardin in Paris  returned to Vienna to introduce the same methods with  Die Presse   which was named for and frankly copied Girardin s publication   21   edit  Categories While most newspapers are aimed at a broad spectrum of readers  usually geographically defined  some focus on groups of readers defined more by their interests than their location  for example  there are daily and weekly business newspapers and sports newspapers  More specialist still are some weekly newspapers  usually free and distributed within limited areas  these may serve communities as specific as certain immigrant populations  or the local gay community   edit  Daily Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz  seen in its Hebrew and English editions A daily newspaper is issued every day  sometimes with the exception of Sundays and occasionally Saturdays  22  and often of some national holidays  Saturday and  where they exist  Sunday editions of daily newspapers tend to be larger  include more specialized sections and advertising inserts  and cost more  Typically  the majority of these newspapers  staff work Monday to Friday  so the Sunday and Monday editions largely depend on content done in advance or content that is syndicated  Most daily newspapers are published in the morning  Afternoon or evening papers are aimed more at commuters and office workers   edit  UK Main article  Sunday editions In the UK  unlike most other countries  most  daily  newspapers do not publish on Sundays  in many cases the same publisher produces a Sunday newspaper  distinct in many ways from the daily  usually with a related name  e g  The Times and The Sunday Times are distinct newspapers owned by the same company  and an article published in the latter would never be credited to The Times   edit  Weekly Main article  Weekly newspaper Weekly newspapers are published once a week  and tend to be smaller than daily papers  Some newspapers are published two or three times a week  in the United States  such newspapers are generally called weeklies citation needed    edit  National Most nations have at least one newspaper that circulates throughout the whole country  a national newspaper  as contrasted with a local newspaper serving a city or region  Some national newspapers  such as The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal  are specialised  in these examples  on financial matters   There are many national newspapers in the UK  but only few in the United States and Canada  In the United States  in addition to national newspapers as such  The New York Times is available throughout the country citation needed   Almost every market has one or two newspapers that dominate the area  Large metropolitan newspapers often have large distribution networks  and can be found outside their normal area  sometimes widely  sometimes from fewer sources  Reading the newspaper  Brookgreen Gardens in Pawleys Island  South Carolina  United States   edit  International There is also a small group of newspapers which may be characterized as international newspapers  Some  such as The International Herald Tribune  have always had that focus  while others are repackaged national newspapers or  international editions  of national or large metropolitan newspapers  In some cases articles that might not interest the wider range of readers are omitted from international editions  in others  of interest to expatriates  significant national news is retained  As English became the international language of business and technology  many newspapers formerly published only in non English languages have also developed English language editions  In places as varied as Jerusalem and Mumbai  newspapers are printed for a local and international English speaking public  and for tourists  The advent of the Internet has also allowed non English language newspapers to put out a scaled down English version to give their newspaper a global outreach  Similarly  in many countries with a large foreign language speaking population or many tourists  newspapers in languages other than the national language are both published locally and imported  For example  newspapers and magazines from many countries  and locally published newspapers in many languages  are readily to be found on news stands in central London   edit  Online Main article  Online newspaper Virtually all printed newspapers have online editions  which depending on the country may be regulated by journalism organizations such as the Press Complaints Commission in the UK  23  But as some publishers find their print based models increasingly unsustainable  Web based  newspapers  have also started to appear  such as the Southport Reporter in the UK and the Seattle Post Intelligencer  24  which stopped publishing in print after 149 years in March 2009 and went online only   edit  Customized A new trend in newspaper publishing is the introduction of individualization through on demand printing technologies  Customized newspapers allow the reader to create their individual newspaper through the selection of individual pages from multiple publications  This  Best of  approach allows to revive the print based model and opens up a new distribution channel to increase coverage beneath the usual boundaries of distribution  Customized newspapers online have been offered by MyYahoo  I Google  CRAYON  ICurrent com  Kibboko com  Twitter times and many others   edit  Organization and personnel Newsboy  Iowa City  1940  Arthur Rothstein  In the United States  the overall manager or chief executive of the newspaper is the publisher  25  In small newspapers  the owner of the publication  or the largest shareholder in the corporation that owns the publication  is usually the publisher  Although he or she rarely or perhaps never writes stories  the publisher is legally responsible for the contents of the entire newspaper and also runs the business  including hiring editors  reporters  and other staff members  This title is less common outside the U S  The equivalent position in the film industry and television news shows is the executive producer  citation needed  Most newspapers have four main departments devoted to publishing the newspaper itself editorial  production printing  circulation  and advertising  although they are frequently referred to by a variety of other names as well as the non newspaper specific departments also found in other businesses of comparable size  such as accounting  marketing  human resources  and IT  Throughout the English speaking world  the person who selects the content for the newspaper is usually referred to as the editor  Variations on this title such as editor in chief  executive editor  and so on are common  For small newspapers  a single editor may be responsible for all content areas  At large newspapers  the most senior editor is in overall charge of the publication  while less senior editors may each focus on one subject area  such as local news or sports  These divisions are called news bureaus or  desks   and each is supervised by a designated editor  Most newspaper editors copy edit the stories for their part of the newspaper  but they may share their workload with proofreaders and fact checkers  Reporters are journalists who primarily report facts that they have gathered and those who write longer  less news oriented articles may be called feature writers  Photographers and graphic artists provide images and illustrations to support articles  Journalists often specialize in a subject area  called a beat  such as sports  religion  or science  Columnists are journalists who write regular articles recounting their personal opinions and experiences  Printers and press operators physically print the newspaper  Printing is outsourced by many newspapers  partly because of the cost of an offset web press  the most common kind of press used to print newspapers  and also because a small newspaper s print run might require less than an hour of operation  meaning that if the newspaper had its own press it would sit idle most of the time  If the newspaper offers information online  webmasters and web designers may be employed to upload stories to the newspaper s website  The staff of the circulation department liaise with retailers who sell the newspaper  sell subscriptions  and supervise distribution of the printed newspapers through the mail  by newspaper carriers  at retailers  and through vending machines  Free newspapers do not sell subscriptions  but they still have a circulation department responsible for distributing the newspapers  Sales staff in the advertising department not only sell space to clients such as local businesses  but also help advertisers design and plan their advertising campaigns  Other members of the advertising department may include graphic designers  who design ads according to the customers  specifications and the department s policies  In an advertising free newspaper  there is no advertising department   edit  Zoned and other editions Newspapers often refine distribution of ads and news through zoning and editioning  Zoning occurs when advertising and editorial content change to reflect the location to which the product is delivered  The editorial content often may change merely to reflect changes in advertising   the quantity and layout of which affects the space available for editorial   or may contain region specific news  In rare instances  the advertising may not change from one zone to another  but there will be different region specific editorial content  As the content can vary widely  zoned editions are often produced in parallel  Editioning occurs in the main sections as news is updated throughout the night  The advertising is usually the same in each edition  with the exception of zoned regionals  in which it is often the  B  section of local news that undergoes advertising changes   As each edition represents the latest news available for the next press run  these editions are produced linearly  with one completed edition being copied and updated for the next edition  The previous edition is always copied to maintain a Newspaper of Record and to fall back on if a quick correction is needed for the press  For example  both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal offer a regional edition  printed through a local contractor  and featuring locale specific content  The Journal s global advertising rate card provides a good example of editioning  26   edit  Format Most modern newspapers are in one of three sizes  Broadsheets  600 mm   380 mm  23    15 inches   generally associated with more intellectual newspapers  although a trend towards  compact  newspapers is changing this  Tabloids  half the size of broadsheets at 380 mm   300 mm  15   11  inches   and often perceived as sensationalist in contrast to broadsheets  citation needed  Examples include The Sun  The National Enquirer  The Star Magazine  New York Post  the Chicago Sun Times  The Globe   Microdaily  is infrequently used to refer to a tabloid sized free daily newspaper that offers lower ad rates than its broadsheet competitors  The content of a microdaily can range from intense local news coverage to a combination of local and national stories  Berliner or Midi  470 mm   315 mm  18    12  inches  used by European papers such as Le Monde in France  La Stampa in Italy  El Pais in Spain and  since 2005  The Guardian in the United Kingdom  Newspapers are usually printed on cheap  off white paper known as newsprint  Since the 1980s  the newspaper industry has largely moved away from lower quality letterpress printing to higher quality  four color process  offset printing  In addition  desktop computers  word processing software  graphics software  digital cameras and digital prepress and typesetting technologies have revolutionized the newspaper production process  These technologies have enabled newspapers to publish color photographs and graphics  as well as innovative layouts and better design  To help their titles stand out on newsstands  some newspapers are printed on coloured newsprint  For example  the Financial Times is printed on a distinctive salmon pink paper  and Sheffield s weekly sports publication derives its name  the Green  Un  from the traditional colour of its paper  The Italian sports newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport is also printed on pink paper while L  quipe  formerly L Auto  is printed on yellow paper  Both the latter promoted major cycling races and their newsprint colours were reflected in the colours of the jerseys used to denote the race leader  for example the leader in the Giro d Italia wears a pink jersey   edit  Circulation and readership Main articles  List of newspapers in the World by circulation and Newspaper circulation The number of copies distributed  either on an average day or on particular days  typically Sunday   is called the newspaper s circulation and is one of the principal factors used to set advertising rates  Circulation is not necessarily the same as copies sold  since some copies or newspapers are distributed without cost  Readership figures may be higher than circulation figures because many copies are read by more than one person  although this is offset by the number of copies distributed but not read  especially for those distributed free   Newspaper vendor  Paddington  London  February 2005 According to the Guinness Book of Records  the daily circulation of the Soviet newspaper Trud exceeded 21 500 000 in 1990  while the Soviet weekly Argumenty i Fakty boasted the circulation of 33 500 000 in 1991  According to United Nations data from 1995 Japan has three daily papers  the Yomiuri Shimbun  Asahi Shimbun  and Mainichi Shimbun   with circulations well above 5 5 million  Germany s Bild  with a circulation of 3 8 million  was the only other paper in that category  In the United Kingdom  The Sun is the top seller  with around 3 24 million copies distributed daily  In the U S   The Wall Street Journal has a daily circulation of approximately 2 02 million  making it the most widely distributed paper in the country  27  While paid readership of print newspapers has been steadily declining in the developed OECD nations  it has been rising in the chief developing nations  Brazil  India  Indonesia  China and South Africa   whose paid daily circulation exceeded those of the developed nations for the first time in 2008  28  In India  The Times of India is the largest circulation English newspaper  with 3 14 million copies daily  According to the 2009 Indian Readership Survey  the Dainik Jagran is the most read  local language  Hindi  newspaper  with 55 7 million readers  29  According to Tom Standage of The Economist  India currently has daily newspaper circulation of 110 million copies  30  American newspaper vending machine  A common measure of a newspaper s health is market penetration  expressed as a percentage of households that receive a copy of the newspaper against the total number of households in the paper s market area  In the 1920s  on a national basis in the U S   daily newspapers achieved market penetration of 123 percent  meaning the average U S  household received 1 23 newspapers   As other media began to compete with newspapers  and as printing became easier and less expensive giving rise to a greater diversity of publications  market penetration began to decline  It wasn t until the early 1970s  however  that market penetration dipped below 100 percent  By 2000  it was 53 percent  31  Many paid for newspapers offer a variety of subscription plans  For example  someone might want only a Sunday paper  or perhaps only Sunday and Saturday  or maybe only a workweek subscription  or perhaps a daily subscription  Most newspapers provide some or all of their content on the Internet  either at no cost or for a fee  In some cases  free access is available only for a matter of days or weeks  or for a certain number of viewed articles  after which readers must register and provide personal data  In other cases  free archives are provided  Journalism News   Writing styleEthics   ObjectivityValues   AttributionDefamationEditorial independenceJournalism schoolList of

newspaper typically generates 70 80  of its revenue from advertising  and the remainder from sales and subscriptions  32  The portion of the newspaper that is not advertising is called editorial content  editorial matter  or simply editorial  although the last term is also used to refer specifically to those articles in which the newspaper and its guest writers express their opinions   This distinction  however  developed over time   early publishers like Girardin  France  and Zang  Austria  did not always distinguish paid items from editorial content   The business model of having advertising subsidize the cost of printing and distributing newspapers  and  it is always hoped  the making of a profit  rather than having subscribers cover the full cost was first done  it seems  in 1833 by The Sun  a daily paper that was published in New York City  Rather than charging 6 cents per copy  the price of a typical New York daily at the time  they charged 1 cent  and depended on advertising to make up the difference  33  Newspapers in countries with easy access to the web have been hurt by the decline of many traditional advertisers  Department stores and supermarkets could be relied upon in the past to buy pages of newspaper advertisements  but due to industry consolidation are much less likely to do so now  34  Additionally  newspapers are seeing traditional advertisers shift to new media platforms  The classified category is shifting to sites including Craigslist  employment websites  and auto sites  National advertisers are shifting to many types of digital content including websites  rich media platforms  and mobile  In recent years  the advertorial emerged  Advertorials are most commonly recognized as an opposite editorial which third parties pay a fee to have included in the paper  Advertorials commonly advertise new products or techniques  such as a new design for golf equipment  a new form of laser surgery  or weight loss drugs  The tone is usually closer to that of a press release than of an objective news story   edit  Journalism Main article  Journalism Since newspapers began as a journal  record of current events   the profession involved in the making of newspapers began to be called journalism  In the yellow journalism era of the 19th century  many newspapers in the United States relied on sensational stories that were meant to anger or excite the public  rather than to inform  The restrained style of reporting that relies on fact checking and accuracy regained popularity around World War II  Criticism of journalism is varied and sometimes vehement  Credibility is questioned because of anonymous sources  errors in facts  spelling  and grammar  real or perceived bias  and scandals involving plagiarism and fabrication  In the past  newspapers have often been owned by so called press barons  and were used for gaining a political voice  After 1920 most major newspapers became parts of chains run by large media corporations such as Gannett  The McClatchy Company  Hearst Corporation  Cox Enterprises  Landmark Media Enterprises LLC  Morris Corporation  The Tribune Company  Hollinger International  News Corporation  Swift Communications  etc  Newspapers have  in the modern world  played an important role in the exercise of freedom of expression  Whistle blowers  and those who  leak  stories of corruption in political circles often choose to inform newspapers before other mediums of communication  relying on the perceived willingness of newspaper editors to expose the secrets and lies of those who would rather cover them  However  there have been many circumstances of the political autonomy of newspapers being curtailed  Opinions of other writers and readers are expressed in the op ed   opposite the editorial page   and letters to the editors sections of the paper  Some ways newspapers have tried to improve their credibility are  appointing ombudsmen  developing ethics policies and training  using more stringent corrections policies  communicating their processes and rationale with readers  and asking sources to review articles after publication   edit  Impact of television and Internet Main article  Future of newspapers Further information  Online Newspapers By the late 1990s  the availability of news via 24 hour television channels and then the Internet posed an ongoing challenge to the business model of most newspapers in developed countries  Paid circulation has declined  while advertising revenue   which makes up the bulk of most newspapers  income   has been shifting from print to the new media  resulting in a general decline in profits  Many newspapers around the world launched online editions in an attempt to follow or stay ahead of their audience  However  in the rest of the world  cheaper printing and distribution  increased literacy  the growing middle class and other factors have more than compensated for the emergence of electronic media and newspapers continue to grow  35  On April 10  1995  The American Reporter 36  became the first daily newspaper  with its own paid reporters around the world and all original content  to start on the Internet  The editor in chief and founder is Joe Shea  The site is owned by 400 journalists  37  The future of newspapers in countries with easy internet access has been widely debated as the industry has faced down soaring newsprint prices  slumping ad sales  the loss of much classified advertising and precipitous drops in circulation  In recent years the number of newspapers slated for closure  bankruptcy or severe cutbacks has risen especially in the United States  where the industry has shed a fifth of its journalists since 2001  38  Revenue has plunged while competition from internet media has squeezed older print publishers  38  The debate has become more urgent lately  as a deepening recession has shaved profits  39  and as once explosive growth in newspaper web revenues has leveled off  forestalling what the industry hoped would become an important source of revenue  40  At issue is whether the newspaper industry faces a cyclical trough  or whether new technology has rendered obsolete newspapers in their traditional format  Reading newspaper print has a lower impact on global warming than reading online  according to one of the world s leading paper makers  because the impact of powering computers allegedly outweighs the impact of creating newsprint   Reading a newspaper has a lower impact on global warming than reading the news online for 30 minutes   according to Torraspapel s Paper  41   edit  See also Journalism portal List of newspaper comic strips Lists of newspapers  edit  Footnotes This article uses bare URLs for citations  Please
