Masaru Ibuka  the co founder of Sony In late 1945  after the end of World War II  Masaru Ibuka started a radio repair shop in a bomb damaged department store Shirokiya building in Nihonbashi of Tokyo  The next year  he was joined by his colleague  Akio Morita  and they founded a company called Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo K K   10   Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation   The company built Japan s first tape recorder  called the Type G  10  In the early 1950s  Ibuka traveled in the United States and heard about Bell Labs  invention of the transistor  10  He convinced Bell to license the transistor technology to his Japanese company  While most American companies were researching the transistor for its military applications  Ibuka and Morita looked to apply it to communications  Although the American companies Regency Electronics and Texas Instruments built the first transistor radio as joint venture  it was Ibuka s company that made them commercially successful for the first time  In August 1955  Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo released the Sony MK 55  Japan s first commercially produced transistor radio  11  They followed up in December of the same year by releasing the Sony TR 72  a product that won favor both within Japan and in export markets  including Canada  Australia  the Netherlands and Germany  Featuring six transistors  push pull output and greatly improved sound quality  the TR 72 continued to be a popular seller into the early sixties  In May 1956  the company released the TR 6  which featured an innovative slim design and sound quality capable of rivaling portable tube radios  It was for the TR 6 that Sony first contracted  Atchan   a cartoon character created by Fuyuhiko Okabe  to become its advertising character  Now known as  Sony Boy   the character first appeared in a cartoon ad holding a TR 6 to his ear  but went on to represent the company in ads for a variety of products well into the mid sixties  10  The following year  1957  Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo came out with the TR 63 model  then the smallest  112   71   32 mm  transistor radio in commercial production  It was a worldwide commercial success  10  University of Arizona professor Michael Brian Schiffer  PhD  says   Sony was not first  but its transistor radio was the most successful  The TR 63 of 1957 cracked open the U S  market and launched the new industry of consumer microelectronics   By the mid 1950s  American teens had begun buying portable transistor radios in huge numbers  helping to propel the fledgling industry from an estimated 100 000 units in 1955 to 5 000 000 units by the end of 1968  Sony Group Headquarters at Sony City in Minato  Tokyo Sony s headquarters moved to Minato  Tokyo from Shinagawa  Tokyo around the end of 2006  12  13   edit  Origin of name When Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo was looking for a romanized name to use to market themselves  they strongly considered using their initials  TTK  The primary reason they did not is that the railway company Tokyo Kyuko was known as TKK  10  The company occasionally used the acronym  Totsuko  in Japan  but during his visit to the United States  Morita discovered that Americans had trouble pronouncing that name  Another early name that was tried out for a while was  Tokyo Teletech  until Akio Morita discovered that there was an American company already using Teletech as a brand name  14  The name  Sony  was chosen for the brand as a mix of two words  One was the Latin word  Sonus   which is the root of sonic and sound  and the other was  Sonny   a familiar term used in 1950s America to call a boy  7  The first Sony branded product  the TR 55 transistor radio  appeared in 1955 but the company name did not change to Sony until January 1958  15  At the time of the change  it was extremely unusual for a Japanese company to use Roman letters to spell its name instead of writing it in kanji  The move was not without opposition  TTK s principal bank at the time  Mitsui  had strong feelings about the name  They pushed for a name such as Sony Electronic Industries  or Sony Teletech  Akio Morita was firm  however  as he did not want the company name tied to any particular industry  Eventually  both Ibuka and Mitsui Bank s chairman gave their approval  10   edit  Formats and technologies Further information  List of Sony trademarks Sony has historically been notable for creating its own in house standards for new recording and storage technologies  instead of adopting those of other manufacturers and standards bodies  The most infamous of these was the videotape format war of the early 1980s  when Sony marketed the Betamax system for video cassette recorders against the VHS format developed by JVC  In the end  VHS gained critical mass in the marketbase and became the worldwide standard for consumer VCRs and Sony adopted the format  While Betamax is for all practical purposes an obsolete format  a professional oriented component video format called Betacam that was derived from Betamax is still used today  especially in the television industry  although far less so in recent years with the introduction of digital and high definition  In 1968 Sony introduced the Trinitron brand name for its lines of aperture grille cathode ray tube televisions and  later  computer monitors  Trinitron displays are still produced  but only for markets such as Pakistan  Bangladesh and China  Sony discontinued the last Trinitron based television set in the USA in early 2007  Trinitron computer monitors were discontinued in 2005  Sony launched the Betamax videocassette recording format in 1975  In 1979 the Walkman brand was introduced  in the form of the world s first portable music player  1982 saw the launch of Sony s professional Betacam videotape format and the collaborative Compact Disc  CD  format  In 1983 Sony introduced 90 mm micro diskettes  better known as 3 5 inch  89 mm  floppy disks   which it had developed at a time when there were 4  floppy disks and a lot of variations from different companies to replace the then on going 5 25  floppy disks  Sony had great success and the format became dominant  3 5  floppy disks gradually became obsolete as they were replaced by current media formats  In 1983 Sony launched the MSX  a home computer system  and introduced the world  with their counterpart Philips  to the Compact Disc  CD   In 1984 Sony launched the Discman series which extended their Walkman brand to portable CD products  In 1985 Sony launched their Handycam products and the Video8 format  Video8 and the follow on hi band Hi8 format became popular in the consumer camcorder market  In 1987 Sony launched the 4 mm DAT or Digital Audio Tape as a new digital audio tape standard  In addition to developing consumer based recording media  after the launch of the CD Sony began development of commercially based recording media  In 1986 they launched Write Once optical discs  WO  and in 1988 launched Magneto optical discs which were around 125MB size for the specific use of archival data storage  16  In the early 1990s two high density optical storage standards were being developed  one was the MultiMedia Compact Disc  MMCD   backed by Philips and Sony  and the other was the Super Density disc  SD   supported by Toshiba and many others  Philips and Sony abandoned their MMCD format and agreed upon Toshiba s SD format with only one modification based on MMCD technology  viz EFMPlus  The unified disc format was called DVD which was marketed in 1997  Sony introduced the MiniDisc format in 1993 as an alternative to Philips DCC or Digital Compact Cassette  Since the introduction of MiniDisc  Sony has attempted to promote its own audio compression technologies under the ATRAC brand  against the more widely used MP3  Until late 2004  Sony s Network Walkman line of digital portable music players did not support the MP3 de facto standard natively  although the provided software SonicStage would convert MP3 files into the ATRAC or ATRAC3 formats  In 1993  Sony challenged the industry standard Dolby Digital 5 1 surround sound format with a newer and more advanced proprietary motion picture digital audio format called SDDS  Sony Dynamic Digital Sound   This format employed eight channels  7 1  of audio opposed to just six used in Dolby Digital 5 1 at the time  Unlike Dolby Digital  SDDS utilized a method of backup by having mirrored arrays of bits on both sides of the film which acted as a measure of reliability in case the film was partially damaged  Ultimately  SDDS has been vastly overshadowed by the preferred DTS  Digital Theatre System  and Dolby Digital standards in the motion picture industry  SDDS was solely developed for use in the theatre circuit  Sony never intended to develop a home theatre version of SDDS  In 1998  Sony launched their Memory Stick format  flash memory cards for use in Sony lines of digital cameras and portable music players  It has seen little support outside of Sony s own products with Secure Digital cards  SD  commanding considerably greater popularity  This is due in part to the SD format s greater throughput  which allows faster recording and access   higher capacities  and significantly lower price per unit capacity compared to Memory Sticks available at the same time  Sony has made updates to the Memory Stick format with Memory Stick Duo and Memory Stick Micro  Sony and Philips jointly developed the Sony Philips digital interface format  S PDIF  and the high fidelity audio system SACD  The latter has since been entrenched in a format war with DVD Audio  At present  neither has gained a major foothold with the general public  CDs are preferred by consumers because of ubiquitous presence of CD drives in consumer devices  In 2004  Sony built upon the MiniDisc format by releasing Hi MD  Hi MD allows the playback and recording of audio on newly introduced 1 GB Hi MD discs in addition to playback and recording on regular MiniDiscs  Recordings on the Hi MD Walkmans can be transferred to and from the computer virtually unrestricted  unlike earlier NetMD  In addition to saving audio on the discs  Hi MD allows the storage of computer files such as documents  videos and photos  Hi MD introduced the ability to record CD quality audio with a linear PCM recording feature  It was the first time since MiniDisc s introduction in 1992 that the ATRAC codec could be bypassed and lossless CD quality audio could be recorded on the small discs  Sony was one of the leading developers and remains one of the strongest proponents of the Blu ray Disc optical disc format  which eventually emerged as the market leader over the competing standard  Toshiba s HD DVD  after a 2 year long format war  The first Blu ray players became commercially available in June 2006  and Sony s first Blu ray player  the Sony BDP S1  debuted in December 2006 with an MSRP of US  999 95  By the end of 2007 the format had the backing of every major motion picture studio except Universal  Paramount  and DreamWorks  17  18  19  The Blu ray format s popularity continued to increase  solidifying its position as the dominant HD media format  and Toshiba announced its decision to stop supporting HD DVD on 19 February 2008  Over the years  Sony has introduced these standards  Umatic   1968  Betamax  1975  Betacam  1981

lines around the world  Sony has developed a music playing robot called Rolly  dog shaped robots called AIBO  humanoids  and QRIO   edit  PlayStation The Slimline PlayStation 2 with controller Originally  Nintendo requested for Sony to develop a CD addon for the SNES  Sony announced the proposed product  dubbed the  Play Station  at the 1991 Consumer Electronics Show  However  Nintendo realised that in the original contract  Sony would have had compete control over all CD based titles for system  and they secretly cancelled all plans  The two companies reached a deal where the Play Station would have a port for the SNES games  but Nintendo would own the rights and receive the bulk of the profits from the games  and the SNES would continue to use the Sony designed audio chip  Sony then began to rework the Play Station concept to target a new generation of hardware and software  The SNES port was removed  as well as the space between  Play  and  Station   making the name of the console PlayStation  In late 1994 Sony launched the PlayStation to compete with other consoles  This successful console was succeeded by the PlayStation 2 in 2000  The PlayStation 2 has become the most successful video game console of all time  selling over 150 million units as of 2011  The PlayStation brand was extended to the portable games market in 2005 by the PlayStation Portable  PSP   Sony developed the Universal Media Disc  UMD  optical disc medium for use on the PlayStation Portable  Although Sony tried to push the UMD format for movies  major studio support for the format was cut back in spring 2006  though as of 2009 some major studio titles continue to be released on UMD  Sony released the PlayStation 3  a high definition console  in 2006  It later introduced the PlayStation Move  an accessory that allows players to control video games using motion controllers  Sony announced that on 1 April 2010 20  it was electronically removing Linux 21  functionality from the first generation PS3  22  A class action has been taken out in California challenging the legality of  the disablement of valuable functionality originally advertised   23  Sony admitted in late 2005 to hiring graffiti artists to spray paint advertisements for their PlayStation Portable game system in seven major cities including New York City  Philadelphia  San Francisco  24  and Sydney  Australia  The mayor of Philadelphia filed a cease and desist order  According to Sony  they paid businesses and building owners for the right to graffiti their walls  25  As of early January 2006  Sony had no plans to keep or withdraw them  In November 2006  a marketing company employed by Sony created a website entitled  All I want for Xmas is a PSP   designed to promote the PSP through viral marketing  The site contained a blog  which was purportedly written by  Charlie   a teenager attempting to get his friend  Jeremy  s parents to buy him a PSP  providing links to t shirt iron ons  Christmas cards  and a  music video  of either Charlie or Jeremy  rapping   However  visitors to the website soon discovered that the website was registered to a marketing company  exposing the site on sites such as YouTube and digg  and Sony was forced to admit the site s true origin in a post on the blog  stating that they would from then on  stick to making cool products  and that they would use the website for  the facts on the PSP   The site has since been taken down  In an interview with next gen biz  Sony admitted that the idea was  poorly executed   26  In 2003  Sony Computer Entertainment America  marketer of the popular PlayStation game consoles  was sued by Immersion Corporation of San Jose  California which claimed that Sony s PlayStation  Dual Shock  controllers infringed on Immersion s patents  In 2004  a federal jury agreed with Immersion  awarding the company US 82 million in damages  A U S  district court judge ruled on the matter in March 2005 and not only agreed with the federal jury s ruling but also added another US 8 7 million in damages  This is likely the reason that the Sixaxis controller for the PlayStation 3 had no rumble feature  The DualShock 3 has since been made available for the PlayStation 3  reintroducing rumble capabilities  Microsoft Corp  was also sued for its Xbox controller  however  unlike Sony  they settled out of court so they could continue using the technology for the follow up Xbox 360  27  A California judge ordered Sony to pay Immersion a licensing fee of 1 37 percent per quarter based on the sales of PlayStation units  Dual Shock controllers  and a selection of PlayStation 2 games that use Immersion s technology  citation needed   edit  VAIO Main article  VAIO Sony offers a line up laptops branded as VAIO  Previously Sony has disabled hardware virtualization on their high end VAIO laptops  citing concern for users running malicious code  28  However  most new VAIO laptops can utilize virtualization  29   edit  Laptop batteries dysfunction In April 2006  a Sony laptop battery exploded in Japan and caught fire  A Japanese couple in Tokyo sued both Sony and Apple Japan for over  2 million  US 16 700  regarding the incident  The suit argues that the man suffered burns on his finger when the battery burst into flames while being used  and his wife had to be treated for mental distress due to the incident  30  On 14 August 2006  Sony and Dell admitted to major flaws in several Sony batteries that could result in the battery overheating and catching fire  As a result they recalled over 4 1 million laptop batteries in the largest computer related recall to that point in history  The cost of this recall was shared between Dell and Sony  Dell also confirmed that one of its laptops caught fire in Illinois  31  32  This recall also prompted Japan s Ministry of Economy  Trade and Industry to order the companies to investigate the troubles with the batteries  The ministry said that Sony must have reported on their findings and drawn up a plan to prevent future problems by the end of August  or face a fine under consumer safety laws  33  On 23 September 2006  Sony announced its investigation 34  of a Lenovo ThinkPad T43 laptop which overheated and caught fire in the Los Angeles International Airport on 16 September  an incident that was confirmed by Lenovo  On 28 September 2006  Sony announced a global battery exchange program in response to growing consumer concerns  35 Acer  Apple Computer  Dell  Fujitsu  IBM  Lenovo  Hewlett Packard  and Toshiba all recalled Sony laptop batteries  36  It was also reported that Fujitsu  Toshiba  and Hitachi were considering the possibility of seeking compensation from Sony over the battery recalls  37  A Japanese newspaper  Yomiuri Shimbun  reported that Sony was aware of faults in its notebook PC batteries in December 2005 but failed to fully study the problem  38  39   edit  Sony Pictures Entertainment In July 2000  a marketing executive working for Sony Corporation created a fictitious film critic  David Manning  who gave consistently good reviews for releases from Sony subsidiary Columbia Pictures that generally received poor reviews amongst real critics  40  When the scandal was revealed  Sony apologised to Ridgefield Press  the newspaper Manning was claimed to be from  Sony claimed it was unaware of the marketing ploy  and pulled the ads and suspended Manning s creator and his supervisor  In 2003  Sony paid the state of Connecticut  325 000 in fines following the Connecticut Attorney General s investigation into Sony s alleged fraudulent marketing practices  41  In August 2005  Sony finalized a settlement to pay  1 5m to fans who saw the reviewed films in the US  42  In 2006 Sony started using ARccOS Protection on some of their film DVDs  which caused compatibility problems with some DVD players   including models manufactured by Sony  After complaints  Sony was forced to issue a recall  43   edit  Sony BMG Main article  Sony BMG CD copy protection scandal In October 2005  it was revealed by Mark Russinovich of Sysinternals that Sony BMG s music CDs had installed a rootkit on the user s computer as a DRM measure  called Extended Copy Protection by its creator  British company First 4 Internet   which was difficult to detect or remove  44  This constitutes a crime in many countries  and poses a major security risk to affected users  The uninstaller Sony initially provided removed the rootkit  but in turn installed a dial home program that posed an even greater security risk  Sony eventually provided an actual uninstaller that removed all of Sony s DRM program from the user s computer  Sony BMG faced several class action lawsuits regarding this matter  45  On 31 January 2007  the U S  Federal Trade Commission issued a news release announcing that Sony BMG had agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that Sony BMG committed several offenses against United States federal law  This settlement required that Sony BMG allow consumers to exchange the CDs through 30 June 2007  and to reimburse consumers for up to  150 for the repair of damage to their computers that they may have incurred while removing the software  In September 2009 Sony had its Mexican office raided by police to recover over 6000 CDs  masters and artwork  by the popular Latin American artist Alejandro Fern ndez  Fern ndez s lawyers claimed that Sony was in breach of contract as Fern ndez had been contracted to Sony for seven albums and the recordings were an eighth album made after the contract had expired  46   edit  Digital photography Sony offers a range of digital cameras  ranging from point and shoot models to digital SLRs  Initially  in October 2005  it was reported by Sony that there were problems with the charge coupled devices  CCD  in 20 models of digital still cameras  The problems can prevent the cameras from taking clear pictures  and in some cases  possibly prevent a picture being taken at all  In late November 2006  the recall was broadened to eight additional models of digital cameras sold between 2003 and 2005  The problem appears to manifest itself mostly when the camera is used in areas with hot weather  The eight models affected are the following  DSC F88  DSC M1  DSC T1  DSC T11  DSC T3  DSC T33  DSC U40 and DSC U50  Sony indicated that they would repair or replace the affected camera at no charge  Since Sony is one of the largest producers of CCD chips  this recall may affect other manufacturers and models of cameras  possibly as many as 100 models or more  Other manufacturers of digital cameras  including Canon  Minolta  Nikon  Olympus or Fuji have indicated they will replace faulty CCDs in their respective models of cameras if necessary  47   edit  Corporate information Sony s current CEO  president and chairman Sir Howard Stringer On 22 June 2005  Nobuyuki Idei stepped down as Sony Corp  Chairman and Group

billion yen   3 2 billion  for the year  due to the effects of the Japanese earthquake  The forecast of a  3 2 billion loss was quite different than its earlier projection of a profit of 70 billion yen   857 million  for the year  51  For the last three years  Sony has lost 399 3 billion yen   5 1 billion  due to fierce competition mainly with Apple Inc  and Samsung Electronics Inc  In September 2000 Sony had a net worth of  100 billion  but by December 2011 it had plunged to  18 billion  52  Sony s TV unit alone set to lose  2 2 billion on tumbling demand and surging yen  Sony has sold off TV factories in Spain  Slovakia and Mexico in the past few years and retains plants of its own in Japan  Brazil  China and Malaysia  In December 2011  Sony has agreed to sell all stake in an LCD joint

made in opposition to energy efficiency standards in California  It also risks a further penalty point in future editions for being a member of trade associations that have commented against energy efficiency standards  54  Together with Philips  Sony receives the highest score for energy policy advocacy after calling on the EU to adopt an unconditional 30  reduction target for greenhouse gas emissions by 2020  Meanwhile  it receives full marks for the efficiency of its products  all of its TVs meet or exceed the latest Energy Star standards  However  Sony scores no points on its paper

the press  The document involved the company s surveillance of environmental activists in an attempt to plan how to counter their movements  It specifically mentioned environmental groups that were trying to pass laws that held electronics producing companies responsible for the clean up of the toxic chemicals contained in their merchandise  62  In early July 2007  Sony ranked 14th on the Greenpeace chart  Guide to Greener Electronics   This chart graded major electronics companies on their environmental work  Sony fell from its earlier 11th place ranking due to Greenpeace s claims that Sony had double standards in their waste policies  63  On 11 January 2011  Sony Computer Entertainment  SCE  filed suit against George Hotz for publishing a technique for hacking the PlayStation 3 to allow it to run alternative operating systems like Linux  The case  Sony Computer Entertainment America v  George Hotz  attracted much negative publicity among hackers and on the Internet at large  On or about 4 April 2011  adherents of the Anonymous movement declared in an open letter 64  that they were directing their hostile  undivided attention  against Sony  largely in response to the Hotz case  65  On 21 April 2011  Sony Computer Entertainment was subjected to distributed denial of service attacks  apparently in retaliation for its case against Hotz  66  67  On April 26 Sony announced that the PlayStation Network  PSN  had been attacked  allegedly resulting in the theft of the personal information of 77 million account holders  It seems that the attack took place between April 17 and 19  68  Sony blamed Anonymous for the attack  69  although at least some Anonymous members denied responsibility  70  Sony decided to shut down the PlayStation Network  indefinitely  following the attack  71  although it returned to service on 14 May  following a 26 day outage  72  Sony was criticized for waiting 6 days after the 21 April attack to disclose the breach to users who may have been impacted  73  and for storing information including credit card numbers  passwords  and security questions  without sufficient encryption  74  The company now faces a class action lawsuit seeking redress for PlayStation Network users  75  A subsequent lawsuit 76  between Sony s insurers sought declaratory action for clarification of their responsibilities listed under the individual policies they had written for Sony  The insurers facing litigation are Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance  AIG  and ACE Ltd  77  On 5 May  Sony released a letter from chairman Sir Howard Stringer  directed at PSN and Qriocity Music Service users  announcing plans for a program which includes a  1 million identity theft insurance policy per user  78  Australia has called for a ban on PSN until Sony can prove network security  79  while Japan is the first country to place an outright ban on the service  80  The PSN service has been fully restored in Japan as of July 5  2011  On 25 May  Sony announced that its Sony Ericsson website in Canada and the Sony Music Entertainment website in Greece had been compromised  putting the personal information of more than 10 000 users at risk  81  Security consultant Phil Lieberman said Sony s approach to customers that wanted to modify PlayStation 3 software  including the decision to sue Hotz  was a fatal mistake   Telling them to bring it on is not the best strategy  I think Sony is beginning to understand it horribly underinvested in security   Lieberman said  82  83  On 29 May 2011  a group called Lulz Security announced 84  a campaign against Sony  using language emblematic of the Anonymous movement  On 2 June 2011  Sony Pictures Entertainment was the subject of an attack  disclosing 1 million user passwords  which were then distributed via BitTorrent  85  The Brand Trust Report 86  published by Trust Research Advisory  has ranked Sony in the 3rd position among the brands in India   edit  See also Sony portal Tokyo portal
