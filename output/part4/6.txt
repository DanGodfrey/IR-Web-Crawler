Timeline of The Walt Disney Company  edit  1923 1928  The silent era In early 1923  Kansas City  Missouri animator Walt Disney created a short film entitled Alice s Wonderland  which featured child actress Virginia Davis interacting with animated characters  Film distributor Margaret J  Winkler contacted Disney with plans to distribute a whole series of Alice Comedies based upon Alice s Wonderland  The contract signed  Walt and his brother Roy Disney moved to Los Angeles  On October 16  1923  they officially set up shop in their uncle Robert Disney s garage  marking the beginning of the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio  4  Within a few months  the company moved into the back of a realty office in downtown Los Angeles  where production continued on the Alice Comedies until 1927  5  In 1926  the studio moved to a newly constructed studio facility on Hyperion Avenue in the Silver Lake district of Los Angeles  5  After the demise of the Alice comedies  Disney developed an all cartoon series starring his first original character  Oswald the Lucky Rabbit  which was distributed by Winkler Pictures through Universal Pictures  Disney only completed 26 Oswald shorts before losing the contract in February 1928  when Winkler s husband Charles Mintz took over their distribution company  Mintz hired away all of Disney s animators except Ub Iwerks to start his own animation studio  4   edit  1928 1934  Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies Original poster for Flowers and Trees  1932  In 1928  to recover from the loss of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit  Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks created Mickey Mouse  Disney s first sound film Steamboat Willie  a cartoon starring Mickey  was released on November 18  1928  It was the third Mickey Mouse cartoon  behind Plane Crazy and The Gallopin  Gaucho  although it was the first cartoon featuring Mickey to find a distributor  Steamboat Willie was an immediate smash hit  and its initial success was attributed not just to Mickey s appeal as a character but to the fact that it was the first cartoon to feature synchronized sound  6  Disney used Pat Powers  Cinephone system  created by Powers using Lee De Forest s Phonofilm system  Steamboat Willie premiered at B  S  Moss s Colony Theater in New York City  7  now The Broadway Theatre  Plane Crazy and The Galloping Gaucho were then retrofitted with synchronized sound tracks and re released successfully in 1929  Disney continued to produce cartoons with Mickey Mouse and other characters  and began the Silly Symphonies series  which was advertised as  Mickey Mouse Presents a Walt Disney Silly Symphony   In 1932  Disney signed an exclusive contract with Technicolor  through the end of 1935  to produce cartoons in color  beginning with Flowers and Trees  1932   Disney released cartoons through Powers  Celebrity Pictures  1928 1930   Columbia Pictures  1930 1932   and United Artists  1932 1937   The popularity of the Mickey Mouse series and the Silly Symphony series allowed Disney to plan for his first feature length animation   edit  1934 1945  Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and World War II The honorary Academy Award given to Walt Disney for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs  Deciding to push the boundaries of animation even further  Disney began production of his first feature length animated film in 1934  Taking three years to complete  Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs  based upon the Grimm Brothers  fairy tale  premiered in December 1937 and became highest grossing film of that time by 1939  8 Snow White was released through RKO Radio Pictures  which had assumed distribution of Disney s product in July 1937  9  after United Artists attempted to attain future television rights to the Disney shorts  10  Using the profits from Snow White  Disney financed the construction of a new 51 acre  210 000 m2  studio complex in Burbank  California  The new Walt Disney Studios  in which the company is headquartered to this day  was completed and open for business by the end of 1939  The following year  Walt Disney Productions had its initial public offering  The studio continued releasing animated shorts and features  such as Pinocchio  1940   Fantasia  1940   Dumbo  1941   and Bambi  1942   After World War II began  box office profits declined  When the United States entered the war after the attack on Pearl Harbor  many of Disney s animators were drafted into the armed forces  The U S  and Canadian governments commissioned the studio to produce training and propaganda films  By 1942 90  of its 550 employees were working on war related films  11  Films such as the feature Victory Through Air Power and the short Education for Death  both 1943  were meant to increase public support for the war effort  Even the studio s characters joined the effort  as Donald Duck appeared in a number of comical propaganda shorts  including the Academy Award winning Der Fuehrer s Face  1943    edit  1946 1954  Post war and television With limited staff and little operating capital during and after the war  Disney s feature films during much of the 1940s were  package films   or collections of shorts  such as The Three Caballeros  1944  and Melody Time  1948   which performed poorly at the box office  At the same time  the studio began producing live action films and documentaries  Song of the South  1946  and So Dear to My Heart  1948  featured animated segments  while the True Life Adventures series  which included such films as Seal Island  1948  and The Vanishing Prairie  1954   were also popular and won numerous awards  The release of Cinderella in 1950 proved that feature length animation could still succeed in the marketplace  Other releases of the period included Alice in Wonderland  1951  and Peter Pan  1953   both in production before the war began  and Disney s first all live action feature  Treasure Island  1950   Other early all live action Disney films included The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men  1952   The Sword and the Rose  1953   and 20 000 Leagues Under the Sea  1954   Disney ended its distribution contract with RKO in 1953  forming its own distribution arm  Buena Vista Distribution  9  In December 1950  Walt Disney Productions and The Coca Cola Company teamed up for Disney s first venture into television  the NBC television network special An Hour in Wonderland  In October 1954  the ABC network launched Disney s first regular television series  Disneyland  which would go on to become one of the longest running primetime series of all time  12 Disneyland allowed Disney a platform to introduce new projects and broadcast older ones  and ABC became Disney s partner in the financing and development of Disney s next venture  located in the middle of an orange grove near Anaheim  California   edit  1955 1965  Disneyland Walt Disney opens Disneyland  July 1955  In 1954  Walt Disney used his Disneyland series to unveil what would become Disneyland  an idea conceived out of a desire for a place where parents and children could both have fun at the same time  On July 18  1955  Walt Disney opened Disneyland to the general public  On July 17  1955  Disneyland was previewed with a live television broadcast hosted by Art Linkletter and Ronald Reagan  After a shaky start  Disneyland continued to grow and attract visitors from across the country and around the world  A major expansion in 1959 included the addition of America s first monorail system  For the 1964 New York World s Fair  Disney prepared four separate attractions for various sponsors  each of which would find its way to Disneyland in one form or another  During this time  Walt Disney was also secretly scouting out new sites for a second Disney theme park  In November 1965   Disney World  was announced  with plans for theme parks  hotels  and even a model city on thousands of acres of land purchased outside of Orlando  Florida  Disney continued to focus its talents on television throughout the 1950s  Its weekday afternoon children s television program The Mickey Mouse Club  featuring its roster of young  Mouseketeers   premiered in 1955 to great success  as did the Davy Crockett miniseries  starring Fess Parker and broadcast on the Disneyland anthology show  Two years later  the Zorro series would prove just as popular  running for two seasons on ABC  as well as separate episodes on the Disneyland series  Despite such success  Walt Disney Productions invested little into television ventures in the 1960s  with the exception of the long running anthology series  later known as The Wonderful World of Disney  Disney s film studios stayed busy as well  averaging five or six releases per year during this period  While the production of shorts slowed significantly during the 1950s and 1960s  the studio released a number of popular animated features  like Lady and the Tramp  1955   Sleeping Beauty  1959  and One Hundred and One Dalmatians  1961   which introduced a new xerography process to transfer the drawings to animation cels  Disney s live action releases were spread across a number of genres  including historical fiction  Johnny Tremain  1957   adaptations of children s books  Pollyanna  1960  and modern day comedies  The Shaggy Dog  1959   Disney s most successful film of the 1960s was a live action animated musical adaptation of Mary Poppins  which received five Academy Awards  including Best Actress Julie Andrews   edit  1966 1971  The deaths of Walt and Roy Disney and the opening of Walt Disney World On December 15  1966  Walt Disney died of lung cancer  and Roy Disney took over as chairman  CEO  and president of the company  One of his first acts was to rename Disney World as  Walt Disney World   in honor of his brother and his vision  In 1967  the last two films Walt actively followed were released  the animated feature The Jungle Book and the musical The Happiest Millionaire  The studio released a number of comedies in the late 1960s  including The Love Bug  1968  and The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes  1969   which starred another young Disney discovery  Kurt Russell  The 1970s opened with the release of Disney s first  post Walt  animated feature  The Aristocats  followed by a return to fantasy musicals in 1971 s Bedknobs and Broomsticks  On October 1  1971  Walt Disney World opened to the public  with Roy Disney dedicating the facility in person later that month  Two months later  on December 20  1971  Roy Disney died of a stroke  leaving the company under control of Donn Tatum  Card Walker  and Walt s son in law Ron Miller  each trained by Walt and Roy  13   edit  1972 1984  Theatrical malaise and new leadership While Walt Disney Productions continued releasing family friendly films throughout the 1970s  such as Escape to Witch Mountain  1975  and Freaky Friday  1976   the films did not fare as well at the box office as earlier material  However  the animation studio saw success with Robin Hood  1973   The Rescuers  1977   and The Fox and the Hound  1981   Inspired by the popularity of Star Wars  the Disney studio produced the science fiction adventure The Black Hole in 1979  The Black Hole was one of the first Disney releases to carry a PG rating  the first being Take Down  also released in 1979  In 1980  Disney has joined venture with Paramount Pictures on the production of the 1980 film adaptation of Popeye  which was a critical failure  yet a moderate box office success  Disney joined with Paramount again in the 1981 fantasy epic Dragonslayer  which was more mature than anything Disney was ever involved with at the time  though it was a box office failure  The releases of these and other PG rated Disney films such as the boldly innovative Tron  1982  led Disney CEO Ron Miller to create Touchstone Pictures as a brand for Disney to release more adult oriented material  Touchstone s first release was the comedy Splash  1984   which was a box office success  With The Wonderful World of Disney remaining a prime time staple  Disney returned to television in the 1970s with syndicated programing such as the anthology series The Mouse Factory and a brief revival of the Mickey Mouse Club  In 1980  Disney launched Walt Disney Home Video to take advantage of the newly emerging videocassette market  On April 18  1983  The Disney Channel debuted as a subscription level channel on cable systems nationwide  featuring its large library of classic films and TV series  along with original programming and family friendly third party offerings  Walt Disney World received much of the company s attention through the 1970s and into the 1980s  In 1978  Disney executives announced plans for the second Walt Disney World theme park  EPCOT Center  which would open in October 1982  Inspired by Walt Disney s dream of a futuristic model city  EPCOT Center was built as a  permanent World s Fair   complete with exhibits sponsored by major American corporations  as well as pavilions based on the cultures of other nations  In Japan  the Oriental Land Company partnered with Walt Disney Productions to build the first Disney theme park outside of the United States  Tokyo Disneyland  which opened in April 1983  Despite the success of the Disney Channel and its new theme park creations  Walt Disney Productions was financially vulnerable  Its film library was valuable  but offered few current successes  and its leadership team was unable to keep up with other studios  particularly the works of Don Bluth  who defected from Disney in 1979  In 1984  financier Saul Steinberg launched a hostile takeover bid for Walt Disney Productions  with the intent of selling off its various assets  Disney successfully fought off the bid with the help of friendly investors  and Sid Bass and Roy Disney s son Roy Edward Disney brought in Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg from Paramount Pictures and Frank Wells from Warner Bros  to head up the company   edit  1984 2004  The Eisner era See also  1984 2004 under Timeline of The Walt Disney Company  With Eisner  Wells  and Katzenberg replacing Ron Miller and Card Walker in 1984  Disney strengthened and revitalized during the second half of the 1980s and early 1990s  Beginning with Who Framed Roger Rabbit  1988   and later  The Little Mermaid  1989   its flagship animation studio enjoyed a series of commercial and critical successes  In addition  the company successfully entered the field of television animation with a number of lavishly budgeted and acclaimed series such as Adventures of the Gummi Bears  Duck Tales and Gargoyles  Disney also broadened its adult offerings in film when then Disney Studio Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg acquired Miramax Films in 1993  Disney acquired many other media sources during the decade  including a merger with Capital Cities ABC in 1996 which brought broadcast network ABC and its assets  including the ESPN networks  into the Disney fold  During the early part of the 1990s  Eisner and his partners set out to plan  The Disney Decade  which was to feature new parks around the world  existing park expansions  new films  and new media investments  While some of the proposals did follow through  most did not  The projects included the Euro Disney Resort  now Disneyland Paris   Disney MGM Studios  now Disney s Hollywood Studios   Disney California Adventure Park  Disney MGM Studios Paris  eventually opened in 2002 as Walt Disney Studios Park   and various film projects including a Who Framed Roger Rabbit franchise  Wells died in a helicopter crash in 1994  The Lion King  which went on to become the most successful hand drawn animated picture of all time  was dedicated to his memory   Shortly thereafter  Katzenberg resigned and formed Dreamworks SKG with partners Steven Spielberg and David Geffen because Eisner would not appoint Katzenberg to Wells  now available post  Instead  Eisner recruited his friend Michael Ovitz  one of the founders of the Creative Artists Agency  to be President  with minimal involvement from Disney s board of directors  which at the time included Oscar winning actor Sidney Poitier  the CEO of Hilton Hotels Corporation Stephen Bollenbach  former U S  Senator George Mitchell  Yale dean Robert A  M  Stern  and Eisner s predecessors Raymond Watson and Card Walker   Ovitz lasted only 14 months and left Disney in December 1996 via a  no fault termination  with a severance package of  38 million in cash and 3 million stock options worth roughly  100 million at the time of Ovitz s departure  The Ovitz episode engendered a long running derivative suit  which finally concluded in June 2006  almost 10 years later  Chancellor William B  Chandler  III of the Delaware Court of Chancery  despite describing Eisner s behavior as falling  far short of what shareholders expect and demand from those entrusted with a fiduciary position     found in favor of Eisner and the rest of the Disney board because they hadn t violated the letter of the law  namely  the duty of care owed by a corporation s officers and board to its shareholders   14   edit   Save Disney  campaign

regarding real estate  edit  Criticism For more details on this topic  see Criticism of The Walt Disney Company  Some of Disney s animated family films have drawn fire for being accused of having sexual references hidden in them  among them The Little Mermaid  1989   Aladdin  1992   and The Lion King  1994   Instances of sexual material hidden in some versions of The Rescuers  1977  and Who Framed Roger Rabbit  1988  resulted in recalls and modifications of the films to remove such content  38  Some religious welfare groups  such as the Catholic League  have opposed films including Priest  1994  and Dogma  1999   39  A book called Growing Up Gay  published by Disney owned Hyperion Press and similar publications  as well as the company s extension of benefits to same sex domestic partners  spurred boycotts of Disney and its advertisers by the Catholic League  the Assemblies of God USA  the American Family Association  and other conservative groups  39  40  41  The boycotts were discontinued by most of these organizations by 2005  42  In addition to these social controversies  the company has been accused of human rights violations regarding the working conditions in factories that produce their merchandise  43  44   edit  Corporate social responsibility Many animation studios are currently setting up arms for conducting activities related to Corporate Social Responsibility  Though many studios are still yet to have fully functional wings for these programs  the Walt Disney Company has already set up many programs in order to cement its image as an entity that is socially responsible  Among the many programs initiated by Disney are the annual Enviroports  i e  environmental report  that Disney now publishes yearly to keep its shareholders in touch with exactly how it attempts to optimize the company s operational impact on environmental issues such as reduction of waste  fossil fuel use  and greenhouse gas emissions  as well as improved eco system protection  45  This has led to appreciation by many third parties such as the Boston College Center for Corporate Citizenship and Reputation Institute  which ranks Disney 2nd in a Corporate Social Responsibility Index  with a score of 81 33  devised in 2010  46  The report also establishes that Disney has improved its performance year on year and is second on two out of the three categories listed for measurement   edit  See also Disney portal Animation portal Film portal Los Angeles portal Companies portal Walt Disney A Trip Through the Walt Disney Studios Disney animated feature film
