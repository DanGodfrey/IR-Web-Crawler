coast of the Pacific Ocean  Washington was carved out of the western part of Washington Territory which had been ceded by Britain in 1846 by the Oregon Treaty as settlement of the Oregon Boundary Dispute  It was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889  Washington is the 18th most extensive and the 13th most populous of the 50 United States  Approximately 60 percent of Washington s residents live in the Seattle metropolitan area  the center of transportation  business  and industry along the Puget Sound region of the Salish Sea  an inlet of the Pacific consisting of numerous islands  deep fjords  and bays carved out by glaciers  The remainder of the state consists of deep rainforests in the west  mountain ranges in the west  center  northeast and far southeast  and a semi arid eastern basin given over to intensive agriculture  Washington is the second most populous state on the west coast and in the western United States after California  Contents 1 Name 2 Geography 2

state named after a president  Washington is commonly called Washington state or occasionally the State of Washington to distinguish it from the U S  capital  However  Washingtonians  residents of Washington  and many residents of neighboring states and Canadians from southern B C  normally refer to the state simply as  Washington   while usually referring to the nation s capital as  Washington  D C   or simply  D C   The area was originally called  Columbia  after the Columbia River  however  to avoid confusion with the District of Columbia  the area was renamed Washington   edit  Geography Digitally colored elevation map of Washington Mt  Rainier reflected in Reflection lake South Eastern Washington Washington is the northwesternmost state of the contiguous United States  Its northern border lies mostly along the 49th parallel  and then via marine boundaries through the Strait of Georgia  Haro Strait and Strait of Juan de Fuca  with the Canadian province of British Columbia to the north  Washington borders Oregon to the south  with the Columbia River forming the western part and the 46th parallel forming the eastern part of the southern boundary  To the east  Washington borders Idaho  bounded mostly by the meridian running north from the confluence of the Snake River and Clearwater River  about 116 57  west   except for the southernmost section where the border follows the Snake River  To the west of Washington lies the Pacific Ocean  6  Washington was a Union territory during the American Civil War  although it never actually participated in the war  Washington is part of a region known as the Pacific Northwest  a term which always includes Washington and Oregon and may or may not include Idaho  western Montana  northern California  and part or all of British Columbia  Alaska  and the Yukon Territory  depending on the user s intent  The high mountains of the Cascade Range run north south  bisecting the state  Western Washington  from the Cascades westward  has a mostly marine west coast climate with mild temperatures and wet winters  autumns  and springs  and relatively dry summers  Western Washington also supports dense forests of conifers and areas of temperate rain forest  7  Washington also is home to several other mountain ranges  the most prominent of which are the Olympic Mountains  far west on the Olympic peninsula  the Kettle River Range in the northeast  and the Blue Mountains in the southeast  In contrast  Eastern Washington  east of the Cascades  has a relatively dry climate with large areas of semiarid steppe and a few truly arid deserts lying in the rainshadow of the Cascades  the Hanford reservation receives an average annual precipitation of between six and seven inches  178 mm   Farther east  the climate becomes less arid  increasing as one goes east to 21 2 inches  538 mm  in Pullman  8  The Palouse southeast region of Washington was grassland that has been mostly converted into farmland  Other parts of eastern Washington are forested and mountainous  The Cascade Range contains several volcanoes  which reach altitudes significantly higher than the rest of the mountains  From the north to the south these volcanoes are Mount Baker  Glacier Peak  Mount St  Helens  and Mount Adams  Mount St  Helens is currently the only Washington volcano that is actively erupting  however  all of them are considered active volcanoes  The state is also home to Mt  Rainier  a volcano 50 miles  80 km  south of the city of Seattle  from which it is prominently visible  The 14 411 foot  4 392 m  tall Mt  Rainier is considered the most dangerous volcano in the continental U S   9  due to its proximity to the Seattle metropolitan area  It is also listed as a Decade Volcano  Washington s position on the Pacific Ocean and the harbors of Puget Sound give the state a leading role in maritime trade with Alaska  Canada  and the Pacific Rim  Puget Sound s many islands are served by the largest ferry fleet in the United States  Washington is a land of contrasts  The deep forests of the Olympic Peninsula  such as the Hoh Rain Forest  are among the only temperate rainforests in the continental United States  but the semi desert east of the Cascade Range has few trees  Mount Rainier  the highest mountain in the state  10  is covered with more glacial ice than any other peak in the lower 48 states  11   edit

October 4  2009  Courtsey  NASA GSFC  MODIS Rapid Response  13  Washington s climate varies greatly from west to east  An oceanic climate  also called  west coast marine climate   predominates in western Washington  and a much drier semi arid climate prevails east of the Cascade Range  Major factors determining Washington s climate include the large semi permanent high pressure and low pressure systems of the north Pacific Ocean  the continental air masses of North America  and the Olympic and Cascade mountains  In the spring and summer  a high pressure anticyclone system dominates the north Pacific Ocean  causing air to spiral out in a clockwise fashion  For Washington this means prevailing winds from the northwest bringing relatively cool air and a predictably dry season  In the autumn and winter  a low pressure cyclone system takes over in the north Pacific Ocean  with air spiraling inward in a counter clockwise fashion  This causes Washington s prevailing winds to come from the southwest  bringing relatively warm and moist air masses and a predictably wet season  The term Pineapple Express is used to describe the extreme form of this wet season pattern  14  Despite western Washington having a marine climate similar to those of many coastal cities of Europe  there are exceptions such as the  Big Snow  events of 1880  1881  1893 and 1916 and the  deep freeze  winters of 1883 84  1915 16  1949 50 and 1955 56  among others  During these events western Washington experienced up to 6 feet  1 8 m  of snow  sub zero   18 C  temperatures  three months with snow on the ground  and lakes and rivers frozen over for weeks  15  Seattle s lowest officially recorded temperature is 0  F   18  C  set on January 31  1950  but low altitude areas approximately three hours away from Seattle have recorded lows as cold as  48  F   44  C   16  In 2006  the Climate Impacts Group at the University of Washington published The Impacts of Climate change in Washington s Economy  a preliminary assessment on the risks and opportunities presented given the possibility of a rise in global temperatures and their effects on Washington state  17   edit  Rain shadow effects Washington experiences extensive variation in rainfall  Rainfall in Washington varies dramatically going from east to west  The western side of the Olympic Peninsula receives as much as 160 inches  4 100 mm  of precipitation annually  making it the wettest area of the 48 conterminous states and a temperate rainforest  Weeks or even months may pass without a clear day  The western slopes of the Cascade Range receive some of the heaviest annual snowfall  in some places more than 200 inches  510 cm  water equivalent  in the country  In the rain shadow area east of the Cascades  the annual precipitation is only 6 inches  150 mm   Precipitation then increases again eastward toward the Rocky Mountains  The Olympic mountains and Cascades compound this climatic pattern by causing orographic lift of the air masses blown inland from the Pacific Ocean  resulting in the windward side of the mountains receiving high levels of precipitation and the leeward side receiving low levels  This occurs most dramatically around the Olympic Mountains and the Cascade Range  In both cases the windward slopes facing southwest receive high precipitation and mild  cool temperatures  While the Puget Sound lowlands are known for clouds and rain in the winter  the western slopes of the Cascades receive larger amounts of precipitation  often falling as snow at higher elevations   Mount Baker  near the state s northern border  is one of the snowiest places in the world  in 1999  it set the world record for snowfall in a single season  1 140 inches  or 95 feet  29 m   18  East of the Cascades  a large region experiences strong rain shadow effects  Semi arid conditions occur in much of eastern Washington with the strongest rain shadow effects at the relatively low elevations of the central Columbia Plateau especially the region just east of the Columbia River from about the Snake River to the Okanagan Highland  Thus instead of rain forests much of eastern Washington is covered with grassland and shrub steppe   edit  Temperatures The average annual temperature ranges from 51  F  11  C  on the Pacific coast to 40  F  4  C  in the northeast  The lowest temperature recorded in the state was  48  F   44  C  in Winthrop and Mazama  The highest recorded temperature in the state was 118  F  48  C  at Ice Harbor Dam  Both records were set east of the Cascades  Western Washington is known for its mild climate  considerable fog  frequent cloud cover and long lasting drizzles in the winter  and sunny and dry summers  The western region occasionally experiences extreme climate  Arctic cold fronts in the winter and heat waves in the summer are not uncommon  In the Western region  temperatures have reached as high as 112  F  44  C  in Marietta 19  and as low as  20  F   29  C  in Longview  20   edit  History Main article  History of Washington  state  The Dalles Dam on the Columbia River A farm and barren hills near Riverside  in northeastern Washington  Mount Rainier with Tacoma in foreground  edit  Early History Prior to the arrival of explorers from Europe  the region had many established tribes of Native Americans  notable for their totem poles and their ornately carved canoes and masks  Prominent among their industries were salmon fishing and  notably among the Makah  whale hunting  The peoples of the Interior had a very different subsistence based culture based on hunting  food gathering and some forms of agriculture  as well as a dependency on salmon from the Columbia and its tributaries  The smallpox epidemic of the 1770s devastated the Amerindian population  21   edit  European exploration The first European record of a landing on the Washington coast was by Spanish Captain Don Bruno de Heceta in 1775  on board the Santiago  part of a two ship flotilla with the Sonora  They claimed all the coastal lands up to Prince William Sound in the north for Spain as part of their claimed rights under the Treaty of Tordesillas  which they maintained made the Pacific a  Spanish lake  and all its shores part of the Spanish Empire  In 1778  British explorer Captain James Cook sighted Cape Flattery  at the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca  but Cook thought the strait did not exist  It was not discovered until Charles William Barkley  captain of the Imperial Eagle  sighted it in 1787  The straits were further explored by Spanish explorers Manuel Quimper in 1790 and Francisco de Eliza in 1791  and British explorer George Vancouver in 1792   edit  Settlement The British Spanish Nootka Convention of 1790 ended Spanish claims of exclusivity and opened the Northwest Coast to explorers and traders from other nations  most notably Britain and Russia as well as the fledgling United States  American captain Robert Gray  for whom Grays Harbor County is named  then discovered the mouth of the Columbia River  He named the river after his ship  the Columbia  Beginning in 1792  Gray established trade in sea otter pelts  The Lewis and Clark Expedition entered the state on October 10  1805  Explorer David Thompson  on his voyage down the Columbia River camped at the junction with the Snake River on July 9  1811 and erected a pole and a notice claiming the country for Great Britain and stating the intention of the North West Company to build a trading post at the site  The UK and the USA agreed to what has since been described as  joint occupancy  of lands west of the Continental Divide to the Pacific Ocean as part of the Anglo American Convention of 1818  which established the 49th Parallel as the international boundary west from Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains  Resolution of the territorial and treaty issues  west to the Pacific  were deferred until a later time  Spain  in 1819  ceded their rights north of the 42nd Parallel to the United States  although these rights did not include possession  Fur trading at Fort Nez Perc s in 1841 Negotiations with Great Britain over the next few decades failed to settle upon a compromise boundary and the Oregon boundary dispute was highly contested between Britain and the United States  Disputed joint occupancy by Britain and the U S  lasted for several decades  With American settlers pouring into Oregon Country  Hudson s Bay Company  which had previously discouraged settlement because it conflicted with the fur trade  reversed its position in an attempt to maintain British control of the Columbia District  Fur trapper James Sinclair  on orders from Sir George Simpson  Governor of the Hudson s Bay Company  led some 200 settlers from the Red River Colony west in 1841 to settle on Hudson Bay Company farms near Fort Vancouver  The party crossed the Rockies into the Columbia Valley  near present day Radium Hot Springs  British Columbia  then traveled south west down the Kootenai River and Columbia River  Despite such efforts  Britain eventually ceded all claims to land south of the 49th parallel to the United States in the Oregon Treaty on June 15  1846  In 1836  a group of missionaries including Marcus Whitman established several missions and Whitman s own settlement Waiilatpu  in what is now southeastern Washington state  near present day Walla Walla County  in territory of both the Cayuse and the Nez Perce Indian tribes  Whitman s settlement would in 1843 help the Oregon Trail  the overland emigration route to the west  get established for thousands of emigrants in following decades  Marcus provided medical care for the Native Americans  but when Indian patients   lacking immunity to new   European  diseases   died in striking numbers  while at the same time many white patients recovered  they held  medicine man  Marcus Whitman personally responsible  and murdered Whitman and twelve other white settlers in the Whitman massacre in 1847  This event triggered the Cayuse War between settlers and Indians  Fort Nisqually  a farm and trading post of the Hudson s Bay Company and the first European settlement in the Puget Sound area  was founded in 1833  Black pioneer George Washington Bush and his caucasian wife  Isabella James Bush  from Missouri and Tennessee  respectively  led four white families into the territory and founded New Market  now Tumwater  in 1846  They settled in Washington to avoid Oregon s discriminatory settlement laws  22  After them  many more settlers  migrating overland along the Oregon trail  wandered north to settle in the Puget Sound area   edit  Statehood Yesler Way  Seattle  1887 In 1852  people from all over what was to become Washington state gathered in Monticello  now Longview  to draft a memorandum to Congress  The memorandum expressed a desire to be granted statehood under the name of Columbia  This meeting came to be known as the Monticello Convention  The Convention s requests were met favorably in Congress  but it was decided that a state named Columbia might be confused with the preexisting District of Columbia  In a manner which strangely enough did not solve the problem of being confused with the nation s capital  the state was instead named Washington in honor of the first U S  president  23  24  Washington became the 42nd state in the United States on November 11  1889  25  Early prominent industries in the state included agriculture and lumber  In eastern Washington  the Yakima River Valley became known for its apple orchards  while the growth of wheat using dry farming techniques became particularly productive  Heavy rainfall to the west of the Cascade Range produced dense forests  and the ports along Puget Sound prospered from the manufacturing and shipping of lumber products  particularly the Douglas fir  Other industries that developed in the state included fishing  salmon canning and mining   edit  Industrial Era Boeing B 17Es under construction c  1942 For a long period  Tacoma was noted for its large smelters where gold  silver  copper and lead ores were treated  Seattle was the primary port for trade with Alaska and the rest of the country  and for a time it possessed a large shipbuilding industry  The region around eastern Puget Sound developed heavy industry during the period including World War I and World War II  and the Boeing company became an established icon in the area  During the Great Depression  a series of hydroelectric dams were constructed along the Columbia river as part of a project to increase the production of electricity  This culminated in 1941 with the completion of the Grand Coulee Dam  the largest concrete structure in the United States  During World War II  the state became a focus for war industries  with the Boeing Company producing many of the nation s heavy bombers and ports in Seattle  Bremerton  Vancouver  and Tacoma were available for the manufacture of warships  Seattle was the point of departure for many soldiers in the Pacific  a number of which were quartered at Golden Gardens Park  In eastern Washington  the Hanford Works atomic energy plant was opened in 1943 and played a major role in the construction of the nation s atomic bombs  On May 18  1980  following a period of heavy tremors and eruptions  the northeast face of Mount St  Helens exploded outward  destroying a large part of the top of the volcano  This eruption flattened the forests  killed 57 people  flooded the Columbia River and its tributaries with ash and mud  and blanketed large parts of Washington and other surrounding states in ash  making day look like night  26  27   edit  Demographics Historical populations Census Pop     1850 1 201   1860 11 594 865 4  1870 23 955 106 6

shift from the state to grocery and warehouse stores  41  Among its resident billionaires  Washington boasts Bill Gates  former chairman of Microsoft  who  with a net worth of  40 billion  was ranked the second wealthiest man in the world as of February 2011  according to Forbes magazine  42  Other Washington state billionaires include Paul Allen  Microsoft   Steve Ballmer  Microsoft   Jeff Bezos

 Washington businesses are responsible for various other state levies  including the business and occupation tax  B  amp  O   a gross receipts tax which charges varying rates for different types of businesses  Starbucks Headquarters  Seattle  Washington s state base sales tax is 6 5 percent which is combined with a local rate  As of April 2010  the rate is 9 5 percent in Seattle and other cities  45  These taxes apply to services as well as products  46  Most foods are exempt from sales tax  however  prepared foods  dietary supplements and soft drinks remain taxable  The combined state and local retail sales tax rates increase the taxes paid by consumers  depending on the variable local sales tax rates  generally between 8 and 9 percent  47  An excise tax applies to certain select products such as gasoline  cigarettes  and alcoholic beverages  Property tax was the first tax levied in the state of Washington and its collection accounts for about 30 percent of Washington s total state and local revenue  It continues to be the most important revenue source for public schools  fire protection  libraries  parks and recreation  and other special purpose districts  All real property and personal property is subject to tax unless specifically exempted by law  Personal property also is taxed  although most personal property owned by individuals is exempt  Personal property tax applies to personal property used when conducting business or to other personal property not exempt by law  All property taxes are paid to the county treasurer s office where the property is located  Washington does not impose a tax on intangible assets such as bank accounts  stocks or bonds  Neither does the state assess any tax on retirement income earned and received from another state  Washington does not collect inheritance taxes  however  the estate tax is decoupled from the federal estate tax laws  and therefore the state imposes its own estate tax  Washington s tax policy differs significantly from neighboring Oregon s  which levies no sales tax but a very high income tax  This leads to border economic anomalies in the Portland Vancouver metropolitan area  Additional border economies exist with neighboring Canada   edit  Agriculture Azwell  Washington  a small community of pickers  cabins and apple orchards  Washington is a leading agricultural state   The following figures are from the Washington State Office of Financial Management and the USDA  National Agricultural Statistics Service  Washington Field Office   For 2003  the total value of Washington s agricultural products was  5 79 billion  the 11th highest in the country  The total value of its crops was  3 8 billion  the 7th highest  The total value of its livestock and specialty products was  1 5 billion  the 26th highest  In 2004  Washington ranked first in the nation in production of red raspberries  90 0 percent of total U S  production   wrinkled seed peas  80 6 percent   hops  75 0 percent   spearmint oil  73 6 percent   apples  58 1 percent   sweet cherries  47 3 percent   pears  42 6 percent   peppermint oil  40 3 percent   Concord grapes  39 3 percent   carrots for processing  36 8 percent   and Niagara grapes  31 6 percent   Washington also ranked second in the nation in production of lentils  fall potatoes  dry edible peas  apricots  grapes  all varieties taken together   asparagus  over a third of the nation s production   sweet corn for processing  and green peas for processing  third in tart cherries  prunes and plums  and dry summer onions  fourth in barley and trout  and fifth in wheat  cranberries  and strawberries  The apple industry is of particular importance to Washington  Because of the favorable climate of dry  warm summers and cold winters of central Washington  the state has led the U S  in apple production since the 1920s  48  Two areas account for the vast majority of the state s apple crop  the Wenatchee Okanogan region  comprising Chelan  Okanogan  Douglas  and Grant counties   and the Yakima region  Yakima  Benton and Kittitas counties   49   edit  Washington wine Main article  Washington wine Washington ranks second in the United States in the production of wine  behind only California  50  By 2006  the state had over 31 000 acres  130 km2  of vineyards  a harvest of 120 000 short tons  109 000 t  of grapes  and exports going to over 40 countries around the world from the 600 wineries located in the state  While there are some viticultural activities in the cooler  wetter western half of the state  the majority  99   of wine grape production takes place in the desert like eastern half  51  The rain shadow of the Cascade Range leaves the Columbia River Basin with around 8 inches  200 mm  of annual rain fall  making irrigation and water rights of paramount interest to the Washington wine industry  Viticulture in the state is also influenced by long sunlight hours  on average  two more hours a day than in California during the growing season  and consistent temperatures  52   edit  Transportation Washington has the largest ferry system in the United States  Floating bridges on Lake Washington  Washington has a system of state highways  called State Routes  as well as an extensive ferry system which is the largest in the nation 53  and the third largest in the world  There are 140 public airfields in Washington  including 16 state airports owned by the Washington State Department of Transportation  Boeing Field in Seattle is one of the busiest primary non hub airports in the US  Seattle Tacoma International Airport  SeaTac  is the other major airport of greater Seattle  54  The unique geography of Washington creates exceptional transportation challenges  There are extensive waterways in the midst of Washington s largest cites  including Seattle  Bellevue  Tacoma and Olympia  The state highways incorporate an extensive network of bridges and the largest ferry system in the United States to serve transportation needs in the Puget Sound area  Washington s marine highway constitutes a fleet of twenty eight ferries that navigate Puget Sound and its inland waterways to 20 different ports of call  completing close to 147 000 sailings each year  Washington is home to four of the five longest floating bridges in the world  the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge  Lacey V  Murrow Memorial Bridge and Homer M  Hadley Memorial Bridge over Lake Washington  and the Hood Canal Bridge which connects the Olympic Peninsula and Kitsap Peninsula  The Cascade Mountain Range also provides unique transportation challenges  Washington operates and maintains roads over seven major mountain passes and eight minor passes  During winter months some of these passes are plowed  sanded  and kept safe with avalanche control  Not all are able to stay open through the winter  The North Cascades Highway  State Route 20  closes every year  This is because the extraordinary amount of snowfall and frequency of avalanches in the area of Washington Pass make it unsafe in the winter months  Washington was rated the best state  amongst fifty U S  states  in the 2011 American State Litter Scorecard  for overall effectiveness and quality of its public space cleanliness from state and related litter debris removal efforts  unseating Vermont  the previous topmost winner  55  Washington is crossed by a number of freight railroads  and Amtrak s passenger Cascade route between Eugene  OR and Vancouver  BC is the eighth busiest Amtrak service in the USA and one of the few profitable routes in the system  Public transportation has generally lagged  although the much delayed link light rail system in the greater Seattle region opened its first line in 2002  Residents of Vancouver have resisted proposals to extend Portland s mass transit system into Washington   edit  Environment In 2007  Washington became the first state in the nation to target all forms of highly toxic brominated flame retardants known as PBDEs for elimination from the many common household products in which they are used  A 2004 study of 40 mothers from Oregon  Washington  British Columbia  and Montana found PBDEs in the breast milk of every woman tested  Three recent studies by the Washington Department of Ecology showed that toxic chemicals banned decades ago continue to linger in the environment and concentrate in the food chain  In one of the studies  state government scientists found unacceptable levels of toxic substances in 93 samples of freshwater fish collected from 45 sites  The toxic substances included PCBs  dioxins  two chlorinated pesticides  DDE and dieldrin  and PBDEs  As a result of the study  the department will investigate the sources of PCBs in the Wenatchee River  where unhealthy levels of PCBs were found in mountain whitefish  Based on the 2007 information and a previous 2004 Ecology study  the Washington Department of Health is advising the public not to eat mountain whitefish from the Wenatchee River from Leavenworth downstream to where the river joins the Columbia  due to unhealthy levels of PCBs  Study results also indicated high levels of contaminants in fish tissue that scientists collected from Lake Washington and the Spokane River  where fish consumption advisories are already in effect  56  On March 27  2006 Governor Christine Gregoire signed into law the recently approved House Bill 2322  This bill would limit phosphorus content in dishwashing detergents statewide to 0 5 percent over the next six years  Though the ban would be effective statewide in 2010  it would take place in Whatcom County  Spokane County  and Clark County in 2008  57  A recent discovery had linked high contents of phosphorus in water to a boom in algae population  An invasive amount of algae in bodies of water would eventually lead to a variety of excess ecological and technological issues  58   edit  Governance See also  Category

as politically divided by the Cascade Mountains  with Western Washington being liberal  particularly the I 5 Corridor  and Eastern Washington being conservative  Washington has voted for the Democratic presidential nominee in every election since 1988  Due to Western Washington s large population  Democrats usually fare better statewide  The Seattle metropolitan combined statistical area  home to almost two thirds of Washington s population  generally delivers stronger Democratic margins than most other parts of Western Washington  This is especially true of King County  home to Seattle itself and almost a third of the state s population  Washington was considered a key swing state in 1968  and it was the only western state to give its electoral votes to Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey over his Republican opponent Richard Nixon  Washington was considered a part of the 1994 Republican Revolution  and had the biggest pickup in the house for Republicans  who picked up seven of Washington s nine House seats  59  However  this dominance did not last for long as Democrats picked up one seat in the 1996 election 60  and two more in 1998  giving the Democrats a 5 4 majority  61  The two current United States Senators from Washington are Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell  both Democrats  The governorship is currently held by Democrat Christine Gregoire  who was re elected to her second term in the 2008 gubernatorial election  Washington is the first and only state in the country to have elected women to both of its United States Senate seats and the office of Governor  Both houses of the Washington State Legislature  the Washington Senate and the Washington House of Representatives  are also controlled by the Democratic Party   edit  Education  edit
