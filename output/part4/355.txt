also worth noting that Warren has his normal white skin but seems to have metallic wings  41   edit  Powers and abilities This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Archangel s primary power is that of natural flight  due to his large feathered wings  His wings have superhuman strength  and they have a very flexible skeletal structure that enables him to press them to the back of his torso and legs with only the slightest bulge visible under his clothing  His bones are hollow  his body processes food more efficiently than a normal human body and does not store any excess fat  and he possesses a greater proportionate muscle mass than normal  As a result  his strength  speed  agility  endurance  reflexes  eyesight  and hearing are at their peak  Elements of his anatomy are comparable to those of birds  His superhumanly sharp eyes can withstand high speed winds which would damage the average human eye  He can breathe at high velocities or altitudes  and he can cope with the reduced temperatures at high altitudes for prolonged periods of time  giving him a greater than normal capacity to endure low temperatures in areas such as the Arctic  The strength in his natural wings can easily break a man s arm or leg  or even put someone through a wall  While he generally flies below the height of clouds  Archangel can reach almost twice this height with little effort  At his absolute maximum  he can reach the highest recorded altitude of a bird in flight   about the height of Mount Everest   but he can only remain that high for a few minutes  Although flight is as natural a mode of transportation for Angel as for a bird  he can only fly nonstop under his own power for around half a day  He has undergone heavy training with Professor X  especially in mastering his flight indoors  He has demonstrated superior agility  reflexes  coordination  and balance while flying  and has been shown defeating superbeings much faster than he is  like the Human Torch volume  amp  issue needed   by dodging them and having them smash against the ground or a wall at full speed  Angel is also an accomplished hand to hand combatant  having defeated several of the werewolf like homo superior when Wolverine is defeated  volume  amp  issue needed  He is trained in hand to hand combat at Xavier s school  while dating Psylocke  he receives a considerable amount of martial arts instruction  volume  amp  issue needed  During his years on the team  he is given extensive training from Wolverine  and when he once surprises Wolverine after taking down some men  he says   My father spoiled me with more than money   volume  amp  issue needed  He also receives further instruction from the Black Widow and Hercules during his days with the Champions  volume  amp  issue needed  His wings have been replaced by Apocalypse with techno organic versions which can appear the same as his natural wings  As the result of a secondary mutation which has been shown inconsistently  Archangel also develops a healing factor and can heal others by mixing his blood with theirs  provided they have a matching blood type to Warren s  volume  amp  issue needed  Although powerful  this mutation varies in potency  At times  he cannot aid the terminally wounded  at others  he can actually raise the recently dead  This secondary mutation suggests that he may be descended from the ancient race of Cheyarafim mutants  He is nearly immune to injury because his healing blood is constantly flowing through him  At its onset  he repairs broken bones in days  but his healing abilities have enhanced since then  However  in an issue of X Force  Warren is savagely attacked and his wings are ripped from his body  His healing factor fails to work  and he instead must be healed by Josh Foley  It is revealed that the Celestial Technology bonded to him by Apocalypse prevents Elixir from regenerating his wings  They regenerate on their own  volume  amp  issue needed  Aside from his superhuman powers  Warren is a highly capable businessman  and is the former chairman of the board and principal stockholder of Worthington Industries   edit  Celestial technology wings Archangel possesses a set of metal techno organic wings grafted onto him by the genetic engineering of Apocalypse when Apocalypse renames him the Horseman of Death  42  These wings are composed of a hard  sharp  organic material that resembles the  organic steel  of Colossus  body  The wings give him the ability to project his metallic feathers out from his wings at great speed and with tremendous force  enabling them to pierce even steel  Archangel does not have complete control over his feathers  which sometimes shoot from his wings against his conscious will in response to his unconscious aggressive drives  The feathers are laced with a neural inhibitor chemical  generated by Archangel s body  which induces temporary paralysis  These wings allow him to fly at speeds much faster than his natural  feathered wings  The edges of these metal wings are also quite sharp  allowing them to be used as weapons  While he believes he has lost his metal wings when he re grows his organic ones  the Celestial Technology never leaves his system  and his natural appearing wings contain the Celestial technology  When implanted into regular human beings  the technology induces a transformation similar to that of Warren s  When his feathered wings are severed from his body by Wolfsbane  his metal wings grow back in their place  Furthermore  his skin reverts back to blue and his old Archangel costume appears  volume  amp  issue needed  Warren s body returns to normal   the metal wings being replaced with the appearance of his feathered ones   indicating that Warren has the ability to switch between metal and feathered wings and his Angel and Archangel appearances  43  During a battle with Selene s Coven  Blink teleports Warren s wings apart  shredding them to pieces  However  within minutes  they begin to painfully re grow  indicating his healing factor may still exist  volume  amp  issue needed  The wings have been shown capable to heal Apocalypse  volume  amp  issue needed   However  as it is shown in issue 14 of X Men  Second Coming  Dr  Nemesis questions the rate that they would grow as the biology is different than Colossus  armor  volume  amp  issue needed  After the death of his Archangel persona via the Life Seed and amnesia  his healing powers are demonstrated as newly active when he resurrects a recently dead dog  44   edit  Other versions  edit  1602 In the 1602 timeline  Warren becomes Werner  a young witchbreed  as mutants are known in this reality  who hides his mutation using garments sewn by his mother  Unfortunately  he is captured and almost burnt at the stake by the Grand Inquisitor Enrique  a k a  Magneto   but rescued at the last moment by Carlos Javier and his students  Safe in England  Werner befriends John Grey unaware that  Master John  is in fact a young woman disguised as a man  This friendship causes jealousy on the part of Scotius Summerisle  who knows of the deception and fears Werner also knows and is trying to court her  They almost come to blows but are reconciled when circumstances lead to Jean s death  It then comes to light that Werner is unaware of Master John s true sex but states that he  was in love with that young man    edit  Age of Apocalypse In the Age of Apocalypse  Warren is never remade as Death by Apocalypse  nor does he ever join the X Men  Instead  as most of New York is destroyed  Angel works with Apocalypse s mutant elite  Magneto and his X Men  and even the Human High Council to maintain and operate a nightclub aptly named Heaven  where humans and mutants can intermingle  When two of his employees  Scarlett MacKenzie and Karma  are apprehended and later killed  Angel finally chooses a side  Strapping himself down with a number of bombs  he attacks Apocalypse s citadel in a suicide run  His sacrifice shuts down the protective shields surrounding the citadel  providing the X Men with a much needed entrance   edit  Earth 5701 In Earth 5701  an Age

of Mephisto  Later  he travels with Mister Fantastic and others to the Negative Zone in the search for Paradise   edit  Exiles Archangel appeared in the comic book Exiles as a member of Weapon X  a more ruthless version of the self titled reality hopping team  This Archangel  hailing from Earth 714  appears very much like his Earth 616 counterpart  even wearing a costume very similar to the one the 616 version wears at the time  Of course  this Archangel  since he is selected for Weapon X rather than the Exiles themselves  is more savage  employing the excessive use of automatic weapons  Archangel is  at some point  replaced by a sociopathic version of Ms  Marvel after he is supposedly sent home for completing his number of missions  He is actually placed in the Panoptichron gallery of fallen Exiles  Why he is placed there is unknown  but he is one of only five recruits to return home alive and intact  alongside She Hulk  Beak  Iron Man  and Daredevil   edit  Marvel Zombies Angel
