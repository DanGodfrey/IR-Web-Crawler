Runner is a 1982 American science fiction film directed by Ridley Scott and starring Harrison Ford  Rutger Hauer  and Sean Young  The screenplay  written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples  is loosely based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep  by Philip K  Dick  The film depicts a dystopian Los Angeles in November 2019 in which genetically engineered organic robots called replicants visually indistinguishable from adult humans are manufactured by the powerful Tyrell Corporation as well as by other  mega manufacturers  around the world  Their use on Earth is banned and replicants are exclusively used for dangerous  menial or leisure work on off world colonies  Replicants who defy the ban and return to Earth are hunted down and  retired  by police special operatives known as  Blade Runners   The plot focuses on a brutal and cunning group of recently escaped replicants hiding in Los Angeles and the burnt out expert Blade Runner  Rick Deckard  Harrison Ford   who reluctantly agrees to take on one more assignment to hunt them down  Blade Runner initially polarized critics  some were displeased with the pacing  while others enjoyed its thematic complexity  The film performed poorly in North American theaters but has since become a cult film  2  The film has been hailed for its production design  depicting a  retrofitted  future  3  and remains a leading example of the neo noir genre  4  It brought the work of Philip K  Dick to the attention of Hollywood and several later films were based on his work  5  Ridley Scott regards Blade Runner as  probably  his most complete and personal film  6  7  In 1993 the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being  culturally  historically  or aesthetically significant   Seven versions of the film have been shown for various markets as a result of controversial changes made by film executives  A rushed Director s Cut was released in 1992 after a strong response to workprint screenings  This  in conjunction with its popularity as a video rental  made it one of the first films released on DVD  resulting in a basic disc with mediocre video and audio quality  8  In 2007 Warner Bros  released The Final Cut  a 25th anniversary digitally remastered version by Scott in selected theaters  and subsequently on DVD  HD DVD  and Blu ray

Ford  is detained and brought by officer Gaff  Edward James Olmos  to his former supervisor  Bryant  M  Emmet Walsh   Deckard  whose job as a  Blade Runner  was to track down bioengineered beings known as replicants and  retire  them   retire  being the official term for the killing of replicants   is told by Bryant that several have escaped and come to Earth illegally  As Tyrell Corporation Nexus 6 models  they have only a four year lifespan  and may have come to Earth to try to extend their lives  Deckard watches a video of another Blade Runner named Holden administering a  Voight Kampff  test designed to distinguish humans from replicants based on their empathic response to questions  The subject of the test  Leon  Brion James   shoots Holden  Bryant wants Deckard to return to work to retire Leon and three other replicants Roy Batty  Rutger Hauer   Zhora  Joanna Cassidy  and Pris  Daryl Hannah   Deckard refuses  but after Bryant makes a veiled threat  he reluctantly agrees  Sent to the Tyrell Corporation to ensure that the test works on Nexus 6 models  Deckard discovers that Tyrell s  Joe Turkel  assistant Rachael  Sean Young  is an experimental replicant who believes herself to be human  Rachael s consciousness has been enhanced with false memories to provide an  emotional cushion   As a result  a more extensive test is required to determine if she is a replicant  Trying to find a way to meet with Tyrell  Roy and Leon go to the eye manufacturing laboratory of Chew  James Hong   forcing him to divulge the identity of J F  Sebastian  William Sanderson   a gifted designer who works closely with Tyrell  Rachael visits Deckard at his apartment to prove her humanity by showing him a family photo  Dropping the photo to the floor  Rachael leaves in tears after Deckard tells her that her memories are only implants taken from a real person  Sent by Roy  Pris meets and gains the confidence of Sebastian at his apartment  where he lives with manufactured companions  While searching Leon s apartment  Deckard finds a photo of Zhora  and a synthetic snake scale that leads him to a strip club where Zhora works  Deckard retires Zhora  and shortly after is told by Bryant to add Rachael  who has disappeared from the Tyrell Corporation headquarters  to his list of retirements  Deckard spots Rachael in a crowd but is disarmed and attacked by Leon  who saw him kill Zhora  Rachael kills Leon using Deckard s gun  and the two return to Deckard s apartment  where he promises not to hunt Rachael  Later they share an intimate moment  Rachael then tries to leave  but Deckard seduces her  Arriving at Sebastian s apartment  Roy tells Pris the others are dead  Sympathetic to their plight  Sebastian reveals that because of a genetic disorder that accelerates his aging  his life will also be cut short  Under a pretext  Sebastian and Roy gain entrance into Tyrell s secure penthouse  where Roy demands more life from his maker  Told that this has proved to be impossible  Roy confesses that he has done  questionable things   Tyrell dismisses Roy s guilt  praising Roy s advanced design and his accomplishments  Responding  Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn t let you into heaven for   Roy kisses Tyrell  then kills him  Sebastian runs for the elevator followed by Roy  who rides the elevator down alone  nb 1  Upon entering Sebastian s apartment  Deckard is ambushed by Pris  but manages to kill her just as Roy returns  Roy and Deckard fight until Roy  his life ending  delivers a soliloquy on his eventful existence and dies in front of Deckard  who watches silently  Gaff arrives and  referring to Rachael  shouts to Deckard  It s too bad she won t live  but then again  who does   Deckard returns to his apartment to find Rachael alive and sleeping in his bed  as they leave  Deckard finds a small tin foil unicorn  a calling card left by his origami making partner Gaff  Depending on the version  Deckard and Rachael either leave the apartment block to an uncertain future  or drive through an idyllic pastoral landscape   edit  Technology  edit  Spinner Screenshot of police spinners flying above Los Angeles  Spinner  is the generic term for the fictional flying cars used in the film  A Spinner can be driven as a ground based vehicle  and take off vertically  hover  and cruise using jet propulsion much like Vertical Take Off and Landing  VTOL  aircraft  They are used extensively by the police to patrol and survey the population  and it is clear that despite restrictions wealthy people can acquire spinner licenses  11  The vehicle was conceived and designed by Syd Mead who described the spinner as an  aerodyne    a vehicle which directs air downward to create lift  though press kits for the film stated that the spinner was propelled by three engines   conventional internal combustion  jet and anti gravity   12  Mead s conceptual drawings were transformed into 25 working vehicles by automobile customizer Gene Winfield  13  A Spinner is on permanent exhibit at the Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame in Seattle  Washington  14   edit  Voight Kampff machine A very advanced form of lie detector that measures contractions of the iris muscle and the presence of invisible airborne particles emitted from the body  The bellows were designed for the latter function and give the machine the menacing air of a sinister insect  The VK is used primarily by Blade Runners to determine if a suspect is truly human by measuring the degree of his empathic response through carefully worded questions and statements  Description from the original 1982 Blade Runner press kit  The Voight Kampff machine  or device  is a fictional interrogation tool  originating in the book where it is spelled Voigt Kampff  The Voight Kampff is a polygraph like machine used by Blade Runners to assist in the testing of an individual to determine if he or she is a replicant  It measures bodily functions such as respiration   blush response   heart rate  and eye movement in response to emotionally provocative questions  15  In the film two replicants take the test  Leon and Rachael  and Deckard tells Tyrell that it usually takes 20 to 30 cross referenced questions to distinguish a replicant  in contrast with the book  where it is stated it only takes  six or seven  questions to make a determination  In the film it takes more than one hundred questions to determine if Rachael is a replicant   edit  Casting and characters Main article  List of Blade Runner characters  edit  Cast Harrison Ford   Rick Deckard Sean Young   Rachael Edward James Olmos   Gaff Rutger Hauer   Roy Batty Daryl Hannah   Pris Joe Turkel   Dr  Eldon Tyrell William Sanderson   J F  Sebastian Joanna Cassidy   Zhora Brion James   Leon Kowalski M  Emmet Walsh   Bryant Casting the film proved troublesome  particularly for the lead role of Deckard  Screenwriter Hampton Fancher envisioned Robert Mitchum as Deckard and wrote the character s dialogue with Mitchum in mind  16  Director Ridley Scott and the film s producers  spent months  meeting and discussing the role with Dustin Hoffman  who eventually departed over differences in vision  16  Harrison Ford was ultimately chosen for several reasons  including his performance in the Star Wars films  Ford s interest in the story of Blade Runner  and discussions with Steven Spielberg who was finishing Raiders of the Lost Ark at the time and strongly praised Ford s work in the film  16  According to production documents  a long list of actors were considered for the role  including Gene Hackman  Sean Connery  Jack Nicholson  Paul Newman  Clint Eastwood  Tommy Lee Jones  Arnold Schwarzenegger  Al Pacino  and Burt Reynolds  16  Coming off the success of Star Wars  1977   The Empire Strikes Back  1980  and Raiders of the Lost Ark  1981   Ford was looking for a role with dramatic depth  After Steven Spielberg praised Ford  he was hired for Blade Runner  In 1992  Ford revealed   Blade Runner is not one of my favorite films  I tangled with Ridley   17  Apart from friction with the director  Ford also disliked the voiceovers   When we started shooting it had been tacitly agreed that the version of the film that we had agreed upon was the version without voiceover narration  It was a f  king nightmare  I thought that the film had worked without the narration  But now I was stuck re creating that narration  And I was obliged to do the voiceovers for people that did not represent the director s interests   18   I went kicking and screaming to the studio to record it   19  In 2006 Scott was asked  Who s the biggest pain in the arse you ve ever worked with    he replied   It s got to be Harrison     he ll forgive me because now I get on with him  Now he s become charming  But he knows a lot  that s the problem  When we worked together it was my first film up and I was the new kid on the block  But we made a good movie   20  Ford said of Scott in 2000   I admire his work  We had a bad patch there  and I m over it   21  In 2006 Ford reflected on the production of the film saying   What I remember more than anything else when I see Blade Runner is not the 50 nights of shooting in the rain  but the voiceover     I was still obliged to work for these clowns that came in writing one bad voiceover after another   22  Ridley Scott confirmed in the summer 2007 issue of Total Film that Harrison Ford contributed to the Blade Runner Special Edition DVD  having already done his interviews   Harrison s fully on board   said Scott  23  The film also used a number of then less well known actors such as Daryl Hannah and Sean Young  24  Casting their roles of Pris and Rachael was also challenging  and a lengthy series of screen tests  with Morgan Paull playing the role of Deckard  were filmed with numerous actresses auditioning  Paull was cast as Deckard s fellow bounty hunter Holden based on his performances in the tests  16  Among the actresses tested for the role of Rachael was Nina Axelrod  who was Paull s recommendation  16 Stacey Nelkin tried out for Pris but was instead given another role in the film  which was ultimately cut before filming  16  Both Axelrod s and Nelkin s screen tests are featured in the 2007 documentary Dangerous Days  Making Blade Runner  Young was picked to play Rachael  Tyrell s assistant  a replicant with memories that belonged to Tyrell s niece  Hannah played Pris  a  basic pleasure model  replicant  and the development of her relationship with Roy Batty is shown as a symbol of the replicants  underlying humanity  One role that was not difficult to cast was Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty  the violent yet thoughtful leader of the replicants  25  Scott cast Hauer without having met him  based solely on Hauer s performances in other films Scott had seen  16  Hauer s portrayal of Batty was regarded by Philip K  Dick as   the perfect Batty cold  Aryan  flawless   26  Of the many films Hauer has done  Blade Runner is his favorite  As he explained in a live chat in 2001   BLADE RUNNER needs no explanation  It just IZZ  sic   All of the best  There is nothing like it  To be part of a real MASTERPIECE which changed the world s thinking  It s awesome   27  Edward James Olmos played Gaff and used his diverse ethnic background  and some in depth personal research  to help create the fictional  Cityspeak  language his character uses in the film  28  His initial addresses to Deckard at the noodle bar is partly in Hungarian and means   Horse dick  No way  You are the Blade     Blade Runner   28 M  Emmet Walsh played the role of Captain Bryant  a hard drinking  sleazy  and underhanded police veteran typical of the film noir genre  Joe Turkel was Dr  Eldon Tyrell  a corporate mogul who built an empire on genetically manipulated humanoid slaves  William Sanderson was cast as J  F  Sebastian  a quiet and lonely genius who provides a compassionate yet compliant portrait of humanity  J  F  sympathizes with the replicants  whom he sees as companions  29  and shares their shorter lifespan because he has  Methuselah Syndrome   a genetic disease resembling progeria that causes faster aging  30 Joe Pantoliano  who later played the role of Cypher in The Matrix  was considered for the role  31  Brion James played Leon Kowalski  a replicant masquerading as a waste disposal engineer  he shoots a Blade Runner to escape  establishing the physical threat the replicants pose to their would be captors  Joanna Cassidy was a special ops  undercover and assassin replicant model called Zhora  Cassidy portrays a strong female who has seen the worst humanity has to offer  Morgan Paull plays Holden  the Blade Runner initially assigned to the case  James Hong as Hannibal Chew  an elderly Asian geneticist specializing in synthetic eyes  Hy Pyke conveyed the sleazy bar owner Taffey Lewis with ease and in a single take  something almost unheard of with Scott whose drive for perfection resulted at times in double digit takes  32   edit  Production The Bradbury Building in Los Angeles was a filming location  Interest in adapting Philip K  Dick s novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep  developed shortly after its 1968 publication  Director Martin Scorsese was interested in filming the novel  but never optioned it  33  Producer Herb Jaffe optioned it in the early 1970s  but Dick was unimpressed with the screenplay written by Herb s son Robert   Jaffe s screenplay was so terribly done     Robert flew down to Santa Ana to speak with me about the project  And the first thing I said to him when he got off the plane was   Shall I beat you up here at the airport  or shall I beat you up back at my apartment     34  The screenplay by Hampton Fancher was optioned in 1977  35  Producer Michael Deeley became interested in Fancher s draft and convinced director Ridley Scott to film it  Scott had previously declined the project  but after leaving the slow production of Dune  wanted a faster paced project to take his mind off his older brother s recent death  36  He joined the project on February 21  1980  and managed to push up the promised Filmways financing from US 13 million to  15 million  Fancher s script focused more on environmental issues and less on issues of humanity and faith  which had featured heavily in the novel and Scott wanted changes  Fancher found a cinema treatment by William S  Burroughs for Alan E  Nourse s novel The Bladerunner  1974   entitled Blade Runner  a movie   nb 2  Scott liked the name  so Deeley obtained the rights to the titles  Eventually he hired David Peoples to rewrite the script and Fancher left the job over the issue on December 21  1980  although he later returned to contribute additional rewrites  37  Having invested over  2 5 million in pre production  38  as the date of commencement of principal photography neared  Filmways withdrew financial backing  In ten days Deeley had secured  21 5 million in financing through a three way deal between The Ladd Company  through Warner Bros    the Hong Kong based producer Sir Run Run Shaw  and Tandem Productions  39  Some of the costumes used in the movie  such as Zhora s raincoat and Sean Young s dark suit  Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame  Seattle  Philip K  Dick became concerned that no one had informed him about the film s production  which added to his distrust of Hollywood  40  After Dick criticized an early version of Hampton Fancher s script in an article written for the Los Angeles Select TV Guide  the studio sent Dick the David Peoples rewrite  41  Although Dick died shortly before the film s release  he was pleased with the rewritten script  and with a twenty minute special effects test reel that was screened for him when he was invited to the studio  Despite his well known skepticism of Hollywood in principle  Dick enthused to Ridley Scott that the world created for the film looked exactly as he had imagined it  26  He said   I saw a segment of Douglas Trumbull s special effects for Blade Runner on the KNBC TV news  I recognized it immediately  It was my own interior world  They caught it perfectly   He also approved of the film s script  saying   After I finished reading the screenplay  I got the novel out and looked through it  The two reinforce each other  so that someone who started with the novel would enjoy the movie and someone who started with the movie would enjoy the novel   42  The motion picture was dedicated to Dick  43  Blade Runner has numerous deep similarities to Fritz Lang s Metropolis  including a built up urban environment  in which the wealthy literally live above the workers  dominated by a huge building the Stadtkrone Tower in Metropolis and the Tyrell Building in Blade Runner  Special effects supervisor David Dryer used stills from Metropolis when lining up Blade Runner s miniature building shots  44  Ridley Scott credits Edward Hopper s painting Nighthawks and the French science fiction comic magazine M tal Hurlant   Heavy Metal    to which the artist Moebius contributed  as stylistic mood sources  45  He also drew on the landscape of  Hong Kong on a very bad day   46  and the industrial landscape of his one time home in northeast England  47  Scott hired Syd Mead as his concept artist who  like Scott  was influenced by M tal Hurlant  48  Moebius was offered the opportunity to assist in the pre production of Blade Runner  but he declined so that he could work on Ren  Laloux s animated film Les Ma tres du temps a decision he later regretted  49 Lawrence G  Paull  production designer  and David Snyder  art director  realized Scott s and Mead s sketches  Douglas Trumbull and Richard Yuricich supervised the special effects for the film  Principal photography of Blade Runner began on March 9  1981  and ended four months later  50   edit  Interpretation Main article  Themes in Blade Runner Dr  Tyrell polarizing his office window to control the Sun implies the god like powers of the Tyrell Corporation  The dark and shadowy elements of film noir cinematography are clearly visible  Although Blade Runner is ostensibly an action film  it operates on multiple dramatic and narrative levels  It is indebted to film noir conventions  the femme fatale  protagonist narration  removed in later versions   dark and shadowy cinematography  and the questionable moral outlook of the hero in this case  extended to include reflections upon the nature of his own humanity  51  52  It is a literate science fiction film  thematically enfolding the philosophy of religion and moral implications of human mastery of genetic engineering in the context of classical Greek drama and hubris  53  It also draws on Biblical images  such as Noah s flood  54  and literary sources  such as Frankenstein  55  Linguistically  the theme of mortality is subtly reiterated in the chess game between Roy and Tyrell  based on the famous Immortal Game of 1851 56  though Scott has said that was coincidental  57  Blade Runner delves into the implications of technology on the environment and on society by reaching to the past  using literature  religious symbolism  classical dramatic themes  and film noir  This tension between past  present  and future is mirrored in the retrofitted future of Blade Runner  which is high tech and gleaming in places but decayed and old elsewhere  Ridley Scott described the film as   extremely dark  both literally and metaphorically  with an oddly masochistic feel   in an interview by Lynn Barber for The Observer  London  in 2002  Scott  liked the idea of exploring pain  in the wake of his brother s skin cancer death   When he was ill  I used to go and visit him in London  and that was really traumatic for me   7  An aura of paranoia suffuses the film  corporate power looms large  the police seem omnipresent  vehicle and warning lights probe into buildings  and the consequences of huge biomedical power over the individual are explored especially the consequences for replicants of their implanted memories  Control over the environment is depicted as taking place on a vast scale  hand in hand with the absence of any natural life  with artificial animals substituting for their extinct predecessors  This oppressive backdrop explains the frequently referenced migration of humans to extra terrestrial   off world   colonies  58  The dystopian themes explored in Blade Runner are an early example of cyberpunk concepts expanding into film  Eyes are a recurring motif  as are manipulated images  calling into question reality and our ability to accurately perceive and remember it  59  60  61  These thematic elements provide an atmosphere of uncertainty for Blade Runner s central theme of examining humanity  In order to discover replicants  an empathy test is used  with a number of its questions focused on the treatment of animals seemingly an essential indicator of someone s  humanity   The replicants appear to show compassion and concern for one another and are juxtaposed against human characters who lack empathy while the mass of humanity on the streets is cold and impersonal  The film goes so far as to put in doubt whether Deckard is human  and forces the audience to re evaluate what it means to be human  62  The question of whether Deckard is intended to be a human or a replicant has been an ongoing controversy since the film s release  63  Both Michael Deeley and Harrison Ford wanted Deckard to be human while Hampton Fancher preferred ambiguity  64  Ridley Scott has confirmed that in his vision Deckard is a replicant  65  66  Deckard s unicorn dream sequence  inserted into the Director s Cut  coinciding with Gaff s parting gift of an origami unicorn is seen by many as showing that Deckard is a replicant as Gaff could have accessed Deckard s implanted memories  55  67  The interpretation that Deckard is a replicant is challenged by others who believe the unicorn imagery shows that the characters  whether human or replicant  share the same dreams and recognize their affinity  68  or that the absence of a decisive answer is crucial to the film s main theme  69  The inherent ambiguity and uncertainty of the film  as well as its textual richness  have permitted viewers to see it from their own perspectives  70   edit  Reception Blade Runner was released in 1 290 theaters on June 25  1982  That date was chosen by producer Alan Ladd  Jr  because his previous highest grossing films  Star Wars and Alien  had a similar opening date  May 25  in 1977 and 1979  making the date his  lucky day   71  The gross for the opening weekend was a disappointing  6 15 million  72  A significant factor in the film s rather poor box office performance was that it was released around the same time as other science fiction films  including The Thing  Star Trek II  The Wrath of Khan  and  most significantly  E T  the Extra Terrestrial  which dominated box office revenues that summer  73  Film critics were polarized as some felt the story had taken a back seat to special effects and that it was not the action adventure the studio had advertised  Others acclaimed its complexity and predicted it would stand the test of time  74  In the United States  a general criticism was its slow pacing that detracts from other strengths  75  Sheila Benson from the Los Angeles Times called it  Blade Crawler   while Pat Berman in The State and Columbia Record described it as  science fiction pornography   76 Roger Ebert praised the visuals of both the original Blade Runner and the Director s Cut versions and recommended it for that reason  however  he found the human story clich d and a little thin  25  In 2007  upon release of The Final Cut  Ebert somewhat revised his original opinion of the film and added it to his list of Great Movies  while noting   I have been assured that my problems in the past with Blade Runner represent a failure of my own taste and imagination  but if the film was perfect  why has Sir Ridley continued to tinker with it   77   edit  Accolades Blade Runner has won and been nominated

films  While not initially a success with North American audiences  the film was popular internationally and became a cult film  99  The film s dark style and futuristic designs have served as a benchmark and its influence can be seen in many subsequent science fiction films  anime  video games  and television programs  51  For example  Ronald D  Moore and David Eick  the producers of the re imagining of Battlestar Galactica  have both cited Blade Runner as one of the major influences for the show  100 Blade Runner continues to reflect modern trends and concerns  and an increasing number consider it one of the greatest science fiction films of all time  101 Blade Runner is also cited as an important influence to both the style and story of the Ghost in the Shell film series  which itself has been highly influential to the future noir genre  102  103  The film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1993 and is frequently used in university courses  104  In 2007 it was named the 2nd most visually influential film of all time by the Visual Effects Society  105  Blade Runner is one of the most musically sampled films of the 20th century  106  The 2009 album  I  Human  by Singaporean band Deus Ex Machina makes numerous references to the genetic engineering and cloning themes from the film  and even features a track entitled  Replicant   107  Blade Runner has influenced adventure games such as  Rise of the Dragon  108  109 Snatcher  109  110 Beneath a Steel Sky  111 Flashback  The Quest for Identity  109 Bubblegum Crisis  and its original anime films   112  113  the role playing game Shadowrun  109  the first person shooter Perfect Dark  114  and the Syndicate series of video games  115  116  The film is also cited as a major influence on Warren Spector  117  designer of the computer game Deus Ex  which displays evidence of the film s influence in both its visual rendering and plot  The look of the film  darkness  neon lights and opacity of vision  is easier to render than complicated backdrops  making it a popular choice for game designers  118  119  Blade Runner has also been the subject of parody  such as the comics Blade Bummer by Crazy comics  120 Bad Rubber by Steve Gallacci  121  and the Red Dwarf 2009 three part miniseries   Back to Earth   122  123   edit  Blade Runner curse Among the folklore that has developed around the film over the years has been the belief that the film was a curse to the companies whose logos were displayed prominently as product placements in some scenes  124  While they were market leaders at the time  more than half experienced disastrous setbacks during the next decade  Atari dominated the home video game market when the film came out  but was making losses by the 1990s  Cuisinart and Pan Am went bankrupt in 1989 and 1991 respectively  The Bell System monopoly was broken up in the year of the film s release  The Coca Cola Company suffered losses during its failed introduction of New Coke in 1985  but soon afterwards regained its market share  56   edit  Future Noir Further information  Tech noir Before the film s principal photography began  Cinefantastique magazine commissioned Paul M  Sammon to write an article about Blade Runner s production which became the book Future Noir  The Making of Blade Runner  referred to as the  Blade Runner Bible  by many of the film s fans   125  The book chronicles the evolution of Blade Runner as a film and focuses on film set politics  especially the British director s experiences with his first American film crew  of which producer Alan Ladd  Jr  has said   Harrison wouldn t speak to Ridley and Ridley wouldn t speak to Harrison  By the end of the shoot Ford was  ready to kill Ridley   said one colleague  He really would have taken him on if he hadn t been talked out of it   126 Future Noir has short cast biographies and quotations about their experiences in making Blade Runner  as well as many photographs of the film s production and preliminary sketches  The cast chapter was deleted from the first edition  though it is available online  A second edition of Future Noir was published in 2007  127   edit  Soundtrack Main article  Blade Runner  soundtrack  The Blade Runner soundtrack by Vangelis is a dark melodic combination of classic composition and futuristic synthesizers which mirrors the film noir retro future envisioned by Ridley Scott  Vangelis  fresh from his Academy Award winning score for Chariots of Fire  128  composed and performed the music on his synthesizers  129  He also made use of various chimes and the vocals of collaborator Demis Roussos  130  Another memorable sound is the haunting tenor sax solo  Love Theme  by British saxophonist Dick Morrissey  who appeared on many of Vangelis  albums  Ridley Scott also used  Memories of Green  from Vangelis  album See You Later  an orchestral version of which Scott would later use in his film Someone to Watch Over Me   131  Along with Vangelis  compositions and ambient textures  the film s sound scape also features a track by the Japanese ensemble Nipponia   Ogi No Mato  or  The Folding Fan as a Target  from the Nonesuch Records release Traditional Vocal and Instrumental Music  and a track by harpist Gail Laughton   Harps of the Ancient Temples  from Laurel Records   132  Despite being well received by fans and critically acclaimed and nominated in 1983 for a BAFTA and Golden Globe as best original score  and the promise of a soundtrack album from Polydor Records in the end titles of the film  the release of the official soundtrack recording was delayed for over a decade  There are two official releases of the music from Blade Runner  In light of the lack of a release of an album  the New American Orchestra recorded an orchestral adaptation in 1982 which bore little resemblance to the original  Some of the film tracks would in 1989 surface on the compilation Vangelis  Themes  but not until the 1992 release of the Director s Cut version would a substantial amount of the film s score see commercial release  130  These delays and poor reproductions led to the production of many bootleg recordings over the years  A bootleg tape surfaced in 1982 at science fiction conventions and became popular given the delay of an official release of the original recordings  and in 1993  Off World Music  Ltd   created a bootleg CD that would prove more comprehensive than Vangelis  official CD in 1994  130  A set with three CDs of Blade Runner related Vangelis music was released in 2007  Titled Blade Runner Trilogy  the first CD contains the same tracks as the 1994 official soundtrack release  the second CD contains previously unreleased music from the movie  and the third CD is all newly composed music from Vangelis  inspired by  and in the spirit of the movie  133   edit  Versions Main article  Versions of Blade Runner Seven different versions of Blade Runner have been shown  The original workprint version  1982  113 minutes  was shown for audience test previews in Denver and Dallas in March 1982  Negative responses to the test previews led to the modifications resulting in the U S  theatrical version  134  135  It was shown as a director s cut without Scott s approval at the Los Angeles Fairfax Theater in May 1990  at an AMPAS showing in April 1991  and in September and October 1991 at the Los Angeles NuArt Theater and the San Francisco Castro Theater  136  Positive responses pushed the studio to approve work on an official director s cut  137  It was re released with the 5 disc Ultimate Edition in 2007  A San Diego Sneak Preview was shown only once  in May 1982  and was almost identical to the Domestic Cut but contained three extra scenes  138  The releases seen by most cinema audiences were  the U S  theatrical version  1982  116 minutes   known as the original version or Domestic Cut  released on Betamax and VHS in 1983 and Laserdisc in 1987  the International Cut  1982  117 minutes   also known as the  Criterion Edition  or  uncut version   which included more violent action scenes than the U S  version  Although initially unavailable in the U S   and distributed in Europe and Asia via theatrical and local Warner Home Video Laserdisc releases  it was later released on VHS and Criterion Collection Laserdisc in North America  and re released in 1992 as a  10th Anniversary Edition   139  The U S  broadcast version  1986  114 minutes  was the U S  theatrical version edited by CBS to tone down the violence  profanity  and nudity to meet broadcasting restrictions  140  The Ridley Scott approved  1991  116 minutes  Director s Cut was prompted by the unauthorized 1990 1991 workprint theatrical release  This Director s Cut was made available on VHS and Laserdisc in 1993  and on DVD in 1997  Significant changes from the theatrical version include  the removal of Deckard s voice over  re insertion of a unicorn sequence  and removal of the studio imposed happy ending  Scott provided extensive notes and consultation to Warner Bros  through film preservationist Michael Arick  who was put in charge of creating the Director s Cut  141  Ridley Scott s The Final Cut  2007  117 minutes   or the  25th Anniversary Edition   was released by Warner Bros  theatrically on October 5  2007  and subsequently released on DVD  HD DVD  and Blu ray Disc in December 2007  9  This is the only version over which Ridley Scott had complete artistic control  as he was not directly in charge of the Director s Cut  141  In conjunction with the Final Cut cinema release  extensive documentary and other materials were produced for the DVD releases which culminated in a five disc  Ultimate Collector s Edition  release by Charles de Lauzirika  8   edit  Derivative works  edit  Novelization Philip K  Dick refused an offer of  400 000 to write a novelization of the Blade Runner screenplay  saying    I was  told the cheapo novelization would have to appeal to the twelve year old audience  and   it  would have probably been disastrous to me artistically   He added   That insistence on my part of bringing out the original novel and not doing the novelization they were just furious  They finally recognized that there was a legitimate reason for reissuing the novel  even though it cost them money  It was a victory not just of contractual obligations but of theoretical principles   42 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep  was eventually reprinted as a tie in  with the film poster as a cover and the original title in parentheses below the Blade Runner title  142   edit  Documentaries On the Edge of Blade Runner  2000  55 minutes  was produced by Nobles Gate Ltd   for Channel 4   directed by Andrew Abbott and hosted written by Mark Kermode  Interviews with production staff  including Scott  give details of the creative process and the turmoil during preproduction  Stories from Paul M  Sammon and Hampton Fancher provide insight into Philip K  Dick and the origins of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep  143  Interwoven are cast interviews  with the notable exceptions of Harrison Ford and Sean Young   which convey some of the difficulties of making the film  including an exacting director and humid  smoggy weather   There is also a tour of some locations  most notably the Bradbury Building and the Warner Bros  backlot that became the LA 2019 streets  which look very different from Scott s dark vision  The documentary then details the test screenings and the resulting changes  the voice over  the happy ending  and the deleted Holden hospital scene   the special effects  the soundtrack by Vangelis  and the unhappy relationship between the filmmakers and the investors which culminated in Deeley and Scott being fired but still working on the film  The question of whether or not Deckard is a replicant surfaces  143  Future Shocks  2003  27 minutes  is a documentary by TVOntario  144  It includes interviews with executive producer Bud Yorkin  Syd Mead  and the cast  this time with Sean Young  but still without Harrison Ford  There is extensive commentary by science fiction author Robert J  Sawyer and from film critics  as the documentary focuses on the themes  visual impact and influence of the film  Edward James Olmos describes Ford s participation  and personal experiences during filming are related by Young  Walsh  Cassidy and Sanderson  They also relate a story about crew members creating T shirts that took pot shots at Scott  The different versions of the film are critiqued and the accuracy of its predictions of the future are discussed  Dangerous Days  Making Blade Runner  2007  183 minutes  is a documentary directed and produced by Charles de Lauzirika for The Final Cut version of the film  It appears with every edition of The Final Cut on DVD  HD DVD and Blu ray Disc  except for the 2010 single disc DVD and Blu Ray editions   It is a DVD format disc  even in the HD DVD and Blu ray Disc editions   It was culled from over 80 interviews  including Harrison Ford  Sean Young  Rutger Hauer  Edward James Olmos  Jerry Perenchio  Bud Yorkin and Ridley Scott  and also contains several alternate and deleted shots within the context of the documentary itself  145  146  The documentary consists of eight chapters  each covering a portion of the film making or in the case of the final chapter  the film s controversial legacy  147  All Our Variant Futures  From Workprint to Final Cut  2007  29 minutes   produced by Paul Prischman  appears on Disc 5 of the Blade Runner Ultimate Collector s Edition and provides an overview of the film s multiple versions and their origins  as well as detailing the seven year long restoration  enhancement and remastering process behind The Final Cut  Included are interviews with director Ridley Scott  restoration producer Charles de Lauzirika  restoration consultant Kurt P  Galvao  restoration VFX supervisor John Scheele and Future Noir  The Making of Blade Runner author Paul M  Sammon  Behind the scenes footage documenting the restoration from archival work done in 2001 through the 2007

included on both the four  and five disc collector s editions of Blade Runner released by Warner Home Video in 2007  9   edit  Sequels and possible prequel K  W  Jeter  a friend of Philip K  Dick  wrote three officially authorized Blade Runner novels that continue Deckard s story  attempting to resolve many of the differences between Blade Runner and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep  148  Blade Runner 2  The Edge of Human  1995  Blade Runner 3  Replicant Night  1996  Blade Runner 4  Eye and Talon  2000  By 1999  Stuart Hazeldine had written a proposed sequel to Blade Runner titled Blade Runner Down  which would have been based on Jeter s first sequel novel  The project was shelved due to rights issues  149 Blade Runner co author David Peoples wrote the 1998 action film Soldier  which was referred to by him as a  sidequel   or spiritual successor  to the original film  150  The 1999 TV series Total Recall 2070  though with a milieu based loosely on off world colony background of another Philip K  Dick inspired film  focuses on replicants  Ridley Scott apparently toyed for years with the idea of a sequel film  possibly titled Metropolis  149  At the 2007 Comic Con Scott again announced that he was considering a sequel to the film  151 Eagle Eye co writer Travis Wright worked with producer Bud Yorke for a few years on the project  His colleague John Glenn  who left the project by 2008  stated the script explores the nature of the off world colonies as well as what happens to the Tyrell Corporation in the wake of its founder s death  152  In June 2009 The New York Times reported that Ridley Scott and his brother Tony Scott were working on a prequel to Blade Runner set at a point in time before 2019  The prequel  Purefold  was planned as a series of 5 10 minute shorts  aimed first at the web and then perhaps television  Due to rights issues the proposed series was not to be linked too closely to the characters or events of the 1982 film  153  On February 7  2010  it was announced that production on Purefold had ceased  due to funding problems  154  On March 4  2011  io9 reported that Bud Yorkin  the producer of Blade Runner  is now developing a sequel or prequel to the film  It was not announced whether this was connected to Ridley Scott or any of the other original filmmakers  155  It was reported that Christopher Nolan  who has worked with Warner Bros  many times in the past  was wanted at the helm of any eventual prequel or sequel  156  It was announced on August 18  2011 that Ridley Scott was to be at the helm of a new Blade Runner movie  either a sequel or a prequel  with filming to begin no earlier than 2013 and a release for the following year  Indications from producer Andrew Kosove were that Harrison Ford was unlikely to be involved in the project  157  158  Scott later said that the film was  liable to be a sequel  but without the previous cast  and that he was close to finding a writer that   might be able to help me deliver   159  On February 6  2012  Kosove denied that any casting considerations had been made in response to buzz that Ford might reprise his role  saying   It is absolutely  patently false that there has been any discussion about Harrison Ford being in Blade Runner  2   To be clear  what we are trying to do with Ridley now is go through the painstaking process of trying to break the back of the story     The casting of the movie could not be further from our minds at this moment   160   edit  Comics Archie Goodwin scripted the comic book adaptation  A Marvel Comics Super Special  Blade Runner  published in September 1982  The Jim Steranko cover leads into a 45 page adaptation illustrated by the team of Al Williamson  Carlos Garzon  Dan Green and Ralph Reese  This adaptation includes the narrative line   Blade runner  You re always movin  on the edge   In 2009 BOOM  Studios published a 24 issue miniseries comic book adaptation of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep   the Blade Runner source novel  161  In April 2010 BOOM  Studios announced a follow up comic Dust to Dust  written by Chris Roberson and drawn by Robert Adler  a four issue miniseries which started production on May 26  2010  162   edit  Video games Main articles  Blade Runner  1985 video game  and Blade Runner  1997 video game  There are two video games based on the film  one for Commodore 64  Sinclair ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC  1985  by CRL Group PLC based on the music by Vangelis  due to licensing issues   and another action adventure PC game  1997  by Westwood Studios  The Westwood PC game featured new characters and branching storylines based on the Blade Runner world  Eldon Tyrell  Gaff  Leon  Rachael  Chew  and J F  Sebastian are seen  and their voice files were recorded by the original actors  DNA Row  the Eye Works  the Police Headquarters  Howie Lee s  the Tyrell Corporation building  and J F  Sebastian s hotel are faithfully replicated  163  The events portrayed in the 1997 game occur not after  but in parallel to those in the film  The player assumes the role of McCoy  another replicant hunter working at the same time as Deckard  Although Deckard is seen in photo evidence and referred to in dialogue  163  Deckard and McCoy never meet  preserving the canon of the film and the independence of the game plot  118  119  The PC game featured a non linear plot  non player characters that each ran in their own independent AI  and an unusual pseudo 3D engine  which eschewed polygonal solids in favor of voxel elements  that did not require the use of a 3D accelerator card to play the game  164   edit  Television series Main article  Total Recall 2070 The television film Total Recall 2070 was initially planned as a spin off of the movie Total Recall  and would eventually be transformed into a hybrid of Total Recall and Blade Runner  165  The Total Recall film was also based on a Philip K  Dick story   We Can Remember It for You Wholesale   many similarities between Total Recall 2070 and Blade Runner were noted  as well as apparent inspiration from Isaac Asimov s The Caves of Steel and the TV series Holmes  amp  Yo Yo  166  Film portal  edit  References Explanatory notes   In The Final Cut   Deckard is told by Bryant that Sebastian s body was found at the apartment  but this is left unsaid in other versions  Sebastian s death was never shot because of concerns over too much violence in the film  10    Some editions of Nourse s novel use the two word spacing Blade Runner  as does the Burroughs book  Citations    Blade Runner
