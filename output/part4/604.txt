popular and high culture of the United States  see Culture of the United States  World Values Survey cultural world map  describing the United States as low in  Rational Secular Values  and high in  Self Expression values   The society or culture of the United States is a Western culture  and has been developing since long before the United States became a country with its own unique social and cultural characteristics such as dialect  music  arts  social habits  cuisine  folklore  etc  Today the United States of America is an ethnically and racially diverse country as result of large scale immigration from many different countries throughout its history  1   Its chief early influences came from English and Irish settlers of colonial America  British culture  due to colonial ties with Britain that spread the English language  legal system and other cultural inheritances  had a formative influence  Other important influences came from other parts of western Europe  The United States has often been thought of as a melting pot  but recent developments tend towards cultural diversity  pluralism and the image of a salad bowl rather than a melting pot  2  3  Due to the extent of American culture there are many integrated but unique social subcultures within the United States  The cultural affiliations an individual in the United States may have commonly depend on social class  political orientation and a multitude of demographic characteristics such as religious background  occupation and ethnic group membership  1  The strongest influences on American culture came from northern European cultures  most prominently from Britain  Ireland  and Germany  Contents 1 Social class and work 2 Race and ancestry 3 Group affiliations 4 Technology  gadgets  and automobiles 5

Social class in the United States Though most Americans today identify themselves as middle class  American society and its culture are considerably more fragmented  1  4  5  Social class  generally described as a combination of educational attainment  income and occupational prestige  is one of the greatest cultural influences in America  1  Nearly all cultural aspects of mundane interactions and consumer behavior in the US are guided by a person s location within the country s social structure  Distinct lifestyles  consumption patterns and values are associated with different classes  Early sociologist economist Thorstein Veblen  for example  noted that those at the very top of the social ladder engage in conspicuous leisure as well as conspicuous consumption  Upper middle class persons commonly identify education and being cultured as prime values  Persons in this particular social class tend to speak in a more direct manner that projects authority  knowledge and thus credibility  They often tend to engage in the consumption of so called mass luxuries  such as designer label clothing  A strong preference for natural materials and organic foods as well as a strong health consciousness tend to be prominent features of the upper middle class  Middle class individuals in general value expanding one s horizon  partially because they are more educated and can afford greater leisure and travels  Working class individuals take great pride in doing what they consider to be  real work   and keep very close knit kin networks that serve as a safeguard against frequent economic instability  1  5  6  Working class Americans as well as many of those in the middle class may also face occupation alienation  In contrast to upper middle class professionals who are mostly hired to conceptualize  supervise and share their thoughts  many Americans enjoy only little autonomy or creative latitude in the workplace  7  As a result white collar professionals tend to be significantly more satisfied with their work  1  7  More recently those in the center of the income strata  who may still identify as middle class  have faced increasing economic insecurity  8  supporting the idea of a working class majority  6  Political behavior is affected by class  more affluent individuals are more likely to vote  and education and income affect whether individuals tend to vote for the Democratic or Republican party  Income also had a significant impact on health as those with higher incomes had better access to health care facilities  higher life expectancy  lower infant mortality rate and increased health consciousness  Hours worked in different countries according to UN data in a CNN report  9  In the United States occupation is one of the prime factors of social class and is closely linked to an individual s identity  The average work week in the US for those employed full time was 42 9 hours long with 30  of the population working more than 40 hours a week  10  It should be noted  however  that many of those in the top two earning quintiles often worked more than 50 hours a week citation needed   The Average American worker earned  16 64 an hour in the first two quarters of 2006  11  Overall Americans worked more than their counterparts in other developed post industrial nations  While the average worker in Denmark enjoyed 30 days of vacation annually  the average American only had 16 annual vacation days  12  In 2000 the average American worked 1 978 hours per year  500 hours more than the average German  yet 100 hours less than the average Czech  Overall the US labor force was the most productive in the world  overall  not by hour worked   largely due to its workers working more than those in any other post industrial country  excluding South Korea   9  Americans generally hold working and being productive in high regard  being busy as and working extensively may also serve as the means to obtain esteem  6   edit  Race and ancestry Main article  Race in the United States Ethnicity according to the 2000 US Census  13  Median Household income along ethnic lines in the United States  Race in the United States is based on physical characteristics and skin color and has played an essential part in shaping American society even before the nation s conception  1  Until the civil rights movement of the 1960s  racial minorities in the United States faced discrimination and social as well as economic marginalization  14  Today the U S  Department of Commerce s Bureau of the Census recognizes four races  Native American or American Indian  African American  Asian and White  European American   According to the U S  government  Hispanic Americans do not constitute a race  but rather an ethnic group  During the 2000 U S  Census Whites made up 75 1  of the population with those being Hispanic or Latino constituting the nation s prevalent minority with 12 5  of the population  African Americans made up 12 3  of the total population  3 6  were Asian American and 0 7  were Native American  13  Approximately 62  of White Americans today are either wholly or partly of English  Welsh  Irish  or Scottish ancestry  Approximately 86  of White Americans are of northwestern European descent  and 14  are of southern and eastern European ancestry  Until the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified on December 6th 1865 the United States was a slave society  While the northern states had outlawed slavery in their territory in the late 18th and early 19th century their industrial economies relied on the raw materials produced by slave labor  Following the Reconstruction period in the 1870s  Southern states initialized an apartheid regulated by Jim Crow laws that provided for legal segregation  Lynching occurred throughout the US until the 1930s  continuing well into the civil rights movement in the South  14  Asian Americans were also marginalized during much of US history  Between 1882 and 1943 the United States government instituted the Chinese Exclusion Act which prohibited Chinese immigrants from entering the nation  During the second world war roughly 120 000 Japanese Americans  62  of whom were U S  citizens  15  were imprisoned in Japanese internment camps  Hispanic Americans also faced segregation and other types of discrimination  they were regularly subject to second class citizen status  in practice if not by law  Largely as a result of being de jure or de facto excluded and marginalized from so called mainstream society  racial minorities in the United States developed their own unique sub cultures  During the 1920s for example  Harlem  New York became home to the Harlem Renaissance  Music styles such as Jazz  Blues and Rap  Rock and roll as well as numerous folk songs such as Blue Tail Fly  Jimmy Crack Corn  originated within the realms of African American culture  14  Chinatowns can be found in many cities across the nation and Asian cuisine has become a common staple in America  The Hispanic community has also had a dramatic impact on American culture  Today  Catholics are the largest religious denomination in the United States and out number Protestants in the South west and California  16  Mariachi music and Mexican cuisine are commonly found throughout the Southwest  with some Latin dishes such burritos and tacos found anywhere in the nation  Economic discrepancies and de facto segregation  however  continue and is a prominent feature of mundane life in the United States  While Asian Americans have prospered and have a median household income and educational attainment far exceeding that of Whites  the same cannot be said for the other racial minorities  African Americans  Hispanics and Native Americans have considerably lower income and education than do White Americans  17  18  In 2005 the median household income of Whites was 62 5  higher than that of African American  nearly one quarter of whom live below the poverty line  17  Furthermore 46 9  of homicide victims in the United States are African American indicating the many severe socio economic problems African Americans and minorities in general continue to face in the twenty first century  14  19  Some aspects of American culture codify racism  For example  the prevailing idea in American culture  perpetuated by the media  has been that that black features are less attractive or desirable than white features  The idea that blackness was ugly was highly damaging to the psyche of African Americans  manifesting itself as internalized racism  20  The Black is beautiful cultural movement sought to dispel this notion  21  In the years after September 11th  discrimination against Arabs and Muslims in the U S  has increased significantly  The American Arab Anti Discrimination Committee  ADC  reported an increase in hate speech  cases of airline discrimination  hate crimes  police misconduct and racial profiling  22  The USA Patriot Act  signed into effect by President Bush on October 26  2001  has also raised concerns for violating civil liberties  Section 412 of the act provides the government with  sweeping new powers to detain immigrants and other foreign nationals indefinitely with little or no due process at the discretion of the Attorney General    23  Other sections also allow the government to conduct secret searches  seizures and surveillance  and to freely interpret the definition of  terrorist activities    edit  Group affiliations The Knights of Columbus exhibiting their group identity  As the United States is a diverse nation  it is home to numerous organization and social groups and individuals may derive their group affiliated identity from a variety of sources  Many Americans  especially white collar professionals belong to professional organizations such as the APA  ASA or ATFLC  although books like Bowling Alone indicate that Americans affiliate with these sorts of groups less often than they did in the 1950s and 1960s  Today  Americans derive a great deal of their identity through their work and professional affiliation  especially among individuals higher on the economic ladder  Recently professional identification has led to many clerical and low level employees giving their occupations new  more respectable titles  such as  Sanitation service engineer  instead of  Janitor   1  Additionally many Americans belong to non profit organizations and religious establishments and may volunteer their services to such organizations  The Rotary Club  the Knights of Columbus or even the SPCA are examples of such non profit and mostly volunteer run organizations  Ethnicity plays another important role in providing some Americans with group identity  14  especially among those who recently immigrated  3  Many American cities are home to ethnic enclaves such as a Chinatown and Little Italies remain in some cities  Local patriotism may be also provide group identity  For example  a person may be particularly proud to be from California or New York City  and may display clothing from local sports team  Political lobbies such as the AARP not only provide individuals with a sentiment of intra group allegiance but also increase their political representation in the nation s political system  Combined  profession  ethnicity  religious  and other group affiliations have provided Americans with a multitude of options from which to derive their group based identity  1   edit  Technology  gadgets  and automobiles Further information  United States technological and industrial history and Passenger vehicles in the United States Americans  by and large  are often fascinated by new technology and new gadgets  There are many within the United States that share the attitude that through technology  many of the evils in the society can be solved  Many of the new technological innovations in the modern world were either first invented in the United States and or first widely adopted by Americans  Examples include  the lightbulb  the airplane  the transistor  nuclear power  the personal computer  video games and online shopping  as well as the development of the Internet  By comparison with Japan  however  only a small fraction of electronic devices make it to sale in the US  and household items such as toilets are rarely festooned with remotes and electronic buttons as they are in some parts of Asia  Automobiles play a great role in American culture  whether it is in the mundane lives of private individuals or in the areas of arts and entertainment  The rise of suburbs and the need for workers to commute to cities brought about the popularization of automobiles  In 2001  90  of Americans drove to work in cars  24  Lower energy and land costs favor the production of relatively large  powerful cars  The culture in the 1950s and 1960s often catered to the automobile with motels and drive in restaurants  Americans tend to view obtaining a driver s license as a rite of passage  Outside of a relative few urban areas  it is considered a necessity for most Americans to own and drive cars  New York City is the only locality in the United States where more than half of all households do not own a car  24   edit  Drugs  alcohol and smoking This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  American attitudes towards drugs and alcoholic beverages have evolved considerably throughout the country s history  In the 19th century  alcohol was readily available and consumed  and no laws restricted the use of other drugs  A movement to ban alcoholic beverages  called the Prohibition movement  emerged in the late 20th century  Several American Protestant religious groups  as well as women s groups such as the Women s Christian Temperance Union  supported the movement  In 1919  Prohibitionists succeeded in amending the Constitution to prohibit the sale of alcohol  Although the Prohibition period did result in lowering alcohol consumption overall  banning alcohol outright proved to be unworkable  as the previously legitimate distillery industry was replaced by criminal gangs which trafficked in alcohol  Prohibition was repealed in 1931  States and localities retained the right to remain  dry   and to this day  a handful still do  During the Vietnam War era  attitudes swung well away from prohibition  Commentators noted that an 18 year old could be drafted to war but could not buy a beer  Most states lowered the legal drinking age to 18  Since 1980  the trend has been toward greater restrictions on alcohol and drug use  The focus this time  however  has been to criminalize behaviors associated with alcohol  rather than attempt to prohibit consumption outright  New York was the first state to enact tough drunk driving laws in 1980  since then all other states have followed suit  A  Just Say No to Drugs  movement replaced the more libertine ethos of the 1960s   edit  Sports A 2004 Army Navy basketball game Main article  Sports in the United States Since the late nineteenth century  baseball is regard as the national sport  football  basketball  and ice hockey are the country s three other leading professional team sports  College football and basketball also attract large audiences  Football is now by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United States  25 Boxing and horse racing were once the most watched individual sports  but they have been eclipsed by golf and auto racing  particularly NASCAR  Soccer  though not a leading professional sport in the country  is played widely at the youth and amateur levels  Tennis and many outdoor sports are also popular   edit  Food and clothing Main articles  Fashion in the United States and Cuisine of the United States A hamburger is a famous food in the United States  The cuisine of the United States is extremely diverse  owing to the vastness of the continent  the relatively large population  1 3 of a billion people  and the number of native and immigrant influences  The types of food served at home vary greatly and depend upon the region of the country and the family s own cultural heritage  Recent immigrants tend to eat food similar to that of their country of origin  and Americanized versions of these cultural foods  such as American Chinese cuisine or Italian American cuisine often eventually appear  an example is Vietnamese cuisine  Korean cuisine and Thai cuisine  German cuisine has a profound impact on American cuisine  especially mid western cuisine  with potatoes  noodles  roasts  stews and cakes pastries being the most iconic ingredients in both cuisines  3  Dishes such as the hamburger  pot roast  baked ham and hot dogs are examples of American dishes derived from German cuisine  26  27  Different regions of the United States have their own cuisine and styles of cooking  The state of Louisiana  for example  is known for its Cajun and Creole cooking  Cajun and Creole cooking are influenced by French  Acadian  and Haitian cooking  although the dishes themselves are original and unique  Examples include Crawfish Etouffee  Red Beans and Rice  Seafood or Chicken Gumbo  Jambalaya  and Boudin  Italian  German  Hungarian and Chinese influences  traditional Native American  Caribbean  Mexican and Greek dishes have also diffused into the general American repertoire  It is not uncommon for a  middle class  family from  middle America  to eat  for example  restaurant pizza  home made pizza  enchiladas con carne  chicken paprikas  beef stroganof and bratwurst with sauerkraut for dinner throughout a single week  An  aloha shirt   popular in Hawaii and temperate western states Apart from professional business attire  clothing in the United States is eclectic and predominantly informal  While Americans  diverse cultural roots are reflected in their clothing  particularly those of recent immigrants  cowboy hats and boots and leather motorcycle jackets are emblematic of specifically American styles  Blue jeans were popularized as work clothes in the 1850s by merchant Levi Strauss  a Jewish German immigrant in San Francisco  and adopted by many American teenagers a century later  They are now widely worn on every continent by people of all ages and social classes  Along with mass marketed informal wear in general  blue jeans are arguably U S  culture s primary contribution to global fashion  28  The country is also home to the headquarters of many leading designer labels such as Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein  Labels such as Abercrombie  amp  Fitch and Eck  cater to various niche markets   edit  Education Main articles  Education in the United States and Educational attainment in the United States Education in the United States is provided mainly by government  with control and funding coming from three levels  federal  state  and local  School attendance is mandatory and nearly universal at the elementary and high school levels  often known outside the United States as the primary and secondary levels   Students have the options of having their education held in public schools  private schools  or home school  In most public and private schools  education is divided into three levels  elementary school  junior high school  also often called middle school   and high school  In almost all schools at these levels  children are divided by age groups into grades  Post secondary education  better known as  college  or  university  in the United States  is generally governed separately from the elementary and high school system  In the year 2000  there were 76 6 million students enrolled in schools from kindergarten through graduate schools  Of these  72 percent aged 12 to 17 were judged academically  on track  for their age  enrolled in school at or above grade level   Of those enrolled in compulsory education  5 2 million  10 4 percent  were attending private schools  Among the country s adult population  over 85 percent have completed high school and 27 percent have received a bachelor s degree or higher   edit  Language Main article  Languages in the United States The primary  although not official  language of the United States is American English  According to the 2000 U S  Census  more than 97  of Americans can speak English well  and for 81  it is the only language spoken at home  Nearly 30 million native speakers of Spanish also reside in the US  There are more than 300 languages besides English which can claim native speakers in the United States some of which are spoken by the indigenous peoples  about 150 living languages  and others which were imported by immigrants  American Sign Language  used mainly by the deaf  is also native to the country  Hawaiian is also a language native to the United States  as it is indigenous nowhere else except in the state of Hawaii  Spanish is the second most common language in the United States  and is one of the official languages  and the most widely spoken  in the U S  Commonwealth of Puerto Rico  There are four major regional dialects in the United States  northeastern  south  inland north  and midwestern  The Midwestern accent  considered the  standard accent  in the United States  and analogous in some respects to the received pronunciation elsewhere in the English speaking world  extends from what were once the  Middle Colonies  across the Midwest to the Pacific states   edit  Religion Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels  the Roman Catholic seat of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles Main article  Religion in the United States Historically  the United States  religious tradition has been dominated by Protestant Christianity  Today over three quarters of Americans identify as Christian with a slight majority identifying as Protestant  56    Catholicism  27   is the largest Christian denomination as Protestants belong to a variety of denominations  Also practiced in the United States are many other religions  such as Judaism  Hinduism  Islam  Buddhism  Mormonism and neo pagan religions   most prominently Wicca  among others  Approximately 16  of American citizens identify as atheist  agnostic  or having no religion  The government is a secular institution  with what is often called the  separation of church and state  prevailing   edit  Housing Immediately after World War II  Americans began living in increasing numbers in the suburbs  belts around major cities with higher density than rural areas  but much lower than urban areas  This move has been attributed to many factors such as the automobile  the availability of large tracts of land  the convenience of more and longer paved roads  the increasing violence in urban centers  see white flight   and the cheapness of housing  These new single family houses were usually one or two stories tall  and often were part of large contracts of homes built by a single developer  The resulting low density development has been given the pejorative label  urban sprawl   This is changing  however   White flight  is reversing  with many Yuppies and upper middle class  empty nest Baby Boomers returning to urban living  usually in condominiums  such as in New York City s Lower East Side  and Chicago s South Loop  The result has been the displacement of many poorer  inner city residents   see gentrification   American cities with housing prices near the national median have also been losing the middle income neighborhoods  those with median income between 80  and 120  of the metropolitan area s median household income  Here  the more affluent members of the middle class  who are also often referred to as being professional or upper middle class  have left in search of larger homes in more exclusive suburbs  This trend is largely attributed to the so called  Middle class squeeze   which has caused a starker distinction between the statistical middle class and the more privileged members of the middle class  29  In more expensive areas such as California  however  another trend has been taking place where an influx of more affluent middle class households has displaced those in the actual middle of society and converted former middle middle class neighborhoods into upper middle class neighborhoods  29  The population of rural areas has been declining over time as more and more people migrate to cities for work and entertainment  The great exodus from the farms came in the 1940s  in recent years fewer than 2  of the population lives on farms  though others live in the countryside and commute to work   Electricity and telephone  and sometimes cable and Internet services are available to all but the most remote regions  As in the cities  children attend school up to and including high school and only help with farming during the summer months or after school  Tract housing in Kentucky near Cincinnati  Ohio About half of Americans now live in what is known as the suburbs  The suburban nuclear family has been identified as part of the  American dream   a married couple with children owning a house in the suburbs  This archetype is reinforced by mass media  religious practices  and government policies and is based on traditions from Anglo Saxon cultures  One of the biggest differences in suburban living as compared to urban living is the housing occupied by the families  The suburbs are filled with single family homes separated from retail districts  industrial areas  and sometimes even public schools  However  many American suburbs are incorporating these districts on smaller scales  attracting more people to these communities  Housing in urban areas may include more apartments and semi attached homes than in the suburbs or small towns  Aside from housing  the major difference from suburban living is the density and diversity of many different subcultures  as well as retail and manufacturing buildings mixed with housing in urban areas  Urban residents are also more likely to travel by mass transit  and children are more likely to walk or bicycle rather than being driven by their parents   edit  Gender relations  edit  Courtship  cohabitation  and adolescent sexuality Main article  Adolescent sexuality in the United States Couples often meet through religious institutions  work  school  or friends   Dating services   services that are geared to assist people in finding partners  are popular both on and offline  The trend over the past few decades has been for more and more couples deciding to cohabit before  or instead of  getting married  The 2000 Census reported 9 7 million different sex partners living together and about 1 3 million same sex partners living together  These cohabitation arrangements have not been the subject of many laws regulating them  though some states now have domestic partner statutes and judge made palimony doctrines that confer some legal support for unmarried couples  Adolescent sex is common  most Americans first have intercourse in their teens  The current data suggests that by the time a person turns 18  slightly more than half of females and nearly two thirds of males will have had intercourse  30  More than half of sexually active teens have had sexual partners they are dating  31  32  Risky sexual behaviors that involve  anything intercourse related  are  rampant  among teenagers  33  Teen pregnancies in the United States decreased 28  between 1990 and 2000 from 117 pregnancies per every 1 000 teens to 84 per 1 000  34  The US is rated  based on 2002 numbers  84 out of 170 countries based on teenage fertility rate  according to the World Health Organization  35   edit  Marriage and divorce Main articles  Marriage in the United States and Divorce in the United States See also  Cohabitation in the United States Marriage laws are established by individual states  Same sex marriage is currently legal in Massachusetts  Iowa  Vermont  Maine  New Hampshire  and Connecticut  New Jersey  California  Oregon  Washington D C   Washington  and Nevada allow same sex couples access to most state level marriage benefits with civil unions or domestic partnerships  Hawaii  Maryland and Colorado offer some benefits to couples in domestic partnerships  New York recognizes out of state same sex marriages but does not perform them  In many states  it is illegal to cross state lines to obtain a marriage that would be illegal in the home state  The typical wedding involves a couple proclaiming their commitment to one another in front of their close relatives and friends  often presided over by a religious figure such as a minister  priest  or rabbi  depending upon the faith of the couple  In traditional Christian ceremonies  the bride s father will  give away   hand off  the bride to the groom  Secular weddings are also common  often presided over by a judge  Justice of the Peace  or other municipal official  Divorce is the province of state governments  so divorce law varies from state to state  Prior to the 1970s  divorcing spouses had to allege that the other spouse was guilty of a crime or sin like abandonment or adultery  when spouses simply could not get along  lawyers were forced to manufacture  uncontested  divorces  The no fault divorce revolution began in 1969 in California  South Dakota was the last state to allow no fault divorce  in 1985  No fault divorce on the grounds of  irreconcilable differences  is now available in all states  However  many states have recently required separation periods prior to a formal divorce decree  State law provides for child support where children are involved  and sometimes for alimony   Married adults now divorce two and a half times as often as adults did 20 years ago and four times as often as they did 50 years ago    between 40  and 60  of new marriages will eventually end in divorce  The probability within    the first five years is 20   and the probability of its ending within the first 10 years is 33     Perhaps 25  of children ages 16 and under live with a stepparent   36  The median length for a marriage in the US today is 11 years with 90  of all divorces being settled out of court   edit  Gender roles Since the 1970s  traditional gender roles of male and female have been increasingly challenged by both legal and social means  Today  there are far fewer roles that are legally restricted by one s sex  The military remains a notable exception  where women may not be put into direct combat by law  Asymmetrical warfare  however  has put women into situations which are direct combat operations in all but name  Most social roles are not gender restricted by law  though there are still cultural inhibitions surrounding certain roles  More and more women have entered the workplace  and in the year 2000 made up 46 6  of the labor force  up from 18 3  in 1900  Most men  however  have not taken up the traditional full time homemaker role  likewise  few men have taken traditionally feminine jobs such as receptionist or nurse  although nursing was traditionally a male role before the American Civil War    edit  Death rituals It is customary for Americans to hold a wake in a funeral home within a couple days of the death of a loved one  The body of the deceased may be embalmed and dressed in fine clothing if there will be an open casket viewing  Traditional Jewish and Muslim practice include a ritual bath and no embalming  Friends  relatives and acquaintances gather  often from distant parts of the country  to  pay their last respects  to the deceased  Flowers are brought to the coffin and sometimes eulogies  elegies  personal anecdotes or group prayers are recited  Otherwise  the attendees sit  stand or kneel in quiet contemplation or prayer  Kissing the corpse on the forehead is typical among Italian Americans 37  and others  Condolences are also offered to the widow or widower and other close relatives  A funeral may be held immediately afterwards or the next day  The funeral ceremony varies according to religion and culture  American Catholics typically hold a funeral mass in a church  which sometimes takes the form of a Requiem mass  Jewish Americans may hold a service in a synagogue or temple  Pallbearers carry the coffin of the deceased to the hearse  which then proceeds in a procession to the place of final repose  usually a cemetery  The unique Jazz funeral of New Orleans features joyous and raucous music and dancing during the procession  Mount Auburn Cemetery  founded in 1831  is known as  America s first garden cemetery   38  American cemeteries created since are distinctive for their park like setting  Rows of graves are covered by lawns and are interspersed with trees and flowers  Headstones  mausoleums  statuary or simple plaques typically mark off the individual graves  Cremation is another common practice in the United States  though it is frowned upon by various religions  The ashes of the deceased are usually placed in an urn  which may be kept in a private house  or they are interred  Sometimes the ashes are released into the atmosphere  The  sprinkling  or  scattering  of the ashes may be part of an informal ceremony  often taking place at a scenic natural feature  a cliff  lake or mountain  that was favored by the deceased  A so called death industry has developed in the United States that has replaced earlier  more informal traditions  Before the popularity of funeral homes  a wake would be held in an ordinary  private house  Often the most elegant room was reserved for this purpose   edit  Household arrangements Further information  American family structure US family structure has no particular household arrangement being prevalent enough to be identified as the average  39  Today  family arrangements in the United States reflect the diverse and dynamic nature of contemporary American society  Although for a relatively brief period of time in the 20th century most families adhered to the nuclear family concept  two married adults with a biological child   single parent families  childless childfree couples  and fused families now constitute the majority of families  Most Americans will marry and get divorced at least once during their life  thus  most individuals will live in a variety of family arrangements  A person may grow up in a single parent family  go on to marry and live in childless couple arrangement  then get divorced  live as a single for a couple of years  re marry  have children and live in a nuclear family arrangement  1  39   The nuclear family    is the idealized version of what most people think when they think of  family     The old definition of what a family is    the nuclear family  no longer seems adequate to cover the wide diversity of household arrangements we see today  according to many social scientists  Edwards 1991  Stacey 1996   Thus has arisen the term postmodern family  which is meant to describe the great variability in family forms  including single parent families and child free couples    Brian K  Williams  Stacey C  Sawyer  Carl M  Wahlstrom  Marriages  Families  amp  Intinamte Relationships  2005  39  Other changes to the landscape of American family arrangements include dual income earner households and delayed independence among American youths  Whereas most families in the 1950s and 1960s relied on one income earner  most commonly the husband  the vast majority of family households now have two income earners  Another change is the increasing age at which young Americans leave their parental home  Traditionally  a person past  college age  who lived with their parent s  was viewed negatively  but today it is not uncommon for children to live with their parents until their mid twenties  This trend can be mostly attributed to rising living costs that far exceed those in decades past  Thus  many young adults now remain with their parents well past their mid 20s  This topic was a cover article of TIME magazine in 2005  Exceptions to the custom of leaving home in one s mid 20s can occur especially among Italian and Hispanic Americans  and in expensive urban real estate markets such as New York City  1   California  2   and Honolulu  3   where monthly rents commonly exceed  1000 a month  Year Families  69 7   Non families  31 2   Married

children with little to no help from the other  This parent is the sole  breadwinner  of the family and thus these households are particularly vulnerable economically  They have higher rates of poverty  and children of these households are more likely to have educational problems   edit  Regional variations Cultural differences in the various regions of the United States are explored in New England  Mid Atlantic States  Southern United States  Midwestern United States  Southwest United States  Western United States and Pacific Northwestern United States pages  The western coast of the continental US consisting of California  Oregon  and the state of Washington is also sometimes referred to as the Left Coast  indicating its Left leaning political orientation and tendency towards liberal norms  folkways and values  Strong cultural differences have a long history in the US with the southern slave society in the antebellum period serving as a prime example  Not only social  but also economic tensions between the Northern and Southern states were so severe that they eventually caused the South to declare itself an independent nation  the Confederate States of America  thus provoking the American civil war  14  One example of regional variations is the attitude towards the discussion of sex  often sexual discussions would have less restrictions in the Northeastern United States  but yet is seen as taboo in the Southern United States  In his 1989 book   Albion s Seed   ISBN 0195069056   David Hackett Fischer suggests that the United States is made up today of four distinct regional cultures  The book s focus is on the folkways of four groups of settlers from the British Isles that emigrated from distinct regions of Britain and Ireland to the British American colonies during the 17th and 18th centuries  Fischer s thesis is that the culture and folkways of each of these groups persisted  with some modification over time  providing the basis for the four modern regional cultures of the United States  According to Fischer  the foundation of American culture was formed from four mass migrations from four different regions of the British Isles by four distinct socio religious groups  New England s earliest settlement period occurred between 1629 and 1640 when Puritans  mostly from East Anglia in England  settled there  forming the New England regional culture  The next mass migration was of southern English cavaliers and their Irish and Scottish domestic servants to the Chesapeake Bay region between 1640 and 1675  producing the Southern American culture  Then  between 1675 and 1725  thousands of Irish  English and German Quakers  led by William Penn  settled in the Delaware Valley  This settlement resulted in the formation of what is today considered the  General American  culture  although  according to Fischer  it is really just a regional American culture  even if it does today encompass most of the U S  from the mid Atlantic states to the Pacific Coast  Finally  Irish  Scottish and English settlers from the borderlands of Britain and Ireland migrated to Appalachia between 1717 and 1775  They formed the regional culture of the Upland South  which has since spread west to such areas as West Texas and parts of the U S  Southwest  Fischer says that the modern U S  is composed only of regional cultures  with characteristics determined by the place of departure and time of arrival of these four distinct founding populations   edit  See also American middle class American dream Protestant work ethic Social structure of the
