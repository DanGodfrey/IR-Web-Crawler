as el Che or simply Che  was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary  physician  author  intellectual  guerrilla leader  diplomat and military theorist  A major figure of the Cuban Revolution  his stylized visage has become a ubiquitous countercultural symbol of rebellion and global insignia within popular culture  8  As a young medical student  Guevara traveled throughout Latin America and was radically transformed by the endemic poverty and alienation he witnessed  9  His experiences and observations during these trips led him to conclude that the region s ingrained economic inequalities were an intrinsic result of capitalism  monopolism  neocolonialism  and imperialism  with the only remedy being world revolution  10  This belief prompted his involvement in Guatemala s social reforms under President Jacobo Arbenz  whose eventual CIA assisted overthrow solidified Guevara s political ideology  Later  while living in Mexico City  he met Ra l and Fidel Castro  joined their 26th of July Movement  and sailed to Cuba aboard the yacht  Granma  with the intention of overthrowing U S  backed Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista  11  Guevara soon rose to prominence among the insurgents  was promoted to second in command  and played a pivotal role in the victorious two year guerrilla campaign that deposed the Batista regime  12  Following the Cuban Revolution  Guevara performed a number of key roles in the new government  These included reviewing the appeals and firing squads for those convicted as war criminals during the revolutionary tribunals  13  instituting agrarian reform as minister of industries  helping spearhead a successful nationwide literacy campaign  serving as both national bank president and instructional director for Cuba s armed forces  and traversing the globe as a diplomat on behalf of Cuban socialism  Such positions also allowed him to play a central role in training the militia forces who repelled the Bay of Pigs Invasion 14  and bringing the Soviet nuclear armed ballistic missiles to Cuba which precipitated the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis  15  Additionally  he was a prolific writer and diarist  composing a seminal manual on guerrilla warfare  along with a best selling memoir about his youthful motorcycle journey across South America  Guevara left Cuba in 1965 to foment revolution abroad  first unsuccessfully in Congo Kinshasa and later in Bolivia  where he was captured by CIA assisted Bolivian forces and executed  16  Guevara remains both a revered and reviled historical figure  polarized in the collective imagination in a multitude of biographies  memoirs  essays  documentaries  songs  and films  As a result of his perceived martyrdom  poetic invocations for class struggle  and desire to create the consciousness of a  new man  driven by moral rather than material incentives  he has evolved into a quintessential icon of various leftist inspired movements  Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century  17  while an Alberto Korda photograph of him entitled Guerrillero Heroico  shown   was declared by the Maryland Institute College of Art as  the most famous photograph in the world   18  Contents 1 Early life 1 1 Intellectual and literary interests 1 2 Motorcycle journey 2 Guatemala  Arbenz and United Fruit 3 Mexico City and preparation 4 Cuban

Ernesto  father  and Ana Mar a  Ernesto Guevara was born to Celia de la Serna y Llosa and Ernesto Guevara Lynch on June 14  1928 1  in Rosario  Argentina  the eldest of five children in an Argentine family of Spanish  Basque and Irish descent  19  In lieu of his parents  surnames  his legal name  Ernesto Guevara  will sometimes appear with de la Serna  or Lynch accompanying it  In reference to Che s  restless  nature  his father declared  the first thing to note is that in my son s veins flowed the blood of the Irish rebels   20  Very early on in life Ernestito  as he was then called  developed an  affinity for the poor   21  Growing up in a family with leftist leanings  Guevara was introduced to a wide spectrum of political perspectives even as a boy  22  His father  a staunch supporter of Republicans from the Spanish Civil War  often hosted many veterans from the conflict in the Guevara home  23  Though suffering crippling bouts of acute asthma that were to afflict him throughout his life  he excelled as an athlete  enjoying swimming  football  golf  and shooting  while also becoming an  untiring  cyclist  24  25  He was an avid rugby union player  26  and played at fly half for Club Universitario de Buenos Aires  27  His rugby playing earned him the nickname  Fuser  a contraction of El Furibundo  raging  and his mother s surname  de la Serna for his aggressive style of play  28  Intellectual and literary interests 22 year old Guevara in 1951 Guevara learned chess from his father and began participating in local tournaments by age 12  During adolescence and throughout his life he was passionate about poetry  especially that of Pablo Neruda  John Keats  Antonio Machado  Federico Garc a Lorca  Gabriela Mistral  C sar Vallejo  and Walt Whitman  29  He could also recite Rudyard Kipling s  If   and Jos  Hern ndez s  Mart n Fierro  from memory  29  The Guevara home contained more than 3 000 books  which allowed Guevara to be an enthusiastic and eclectic reader  with interests including Karl Marx  William Faulkner  Andr  Gide  Emilio Salgari and Jules Verne  30  Additionally  he enjoyed the works of Jawaharlal Nehru  Franz Kafka  Albert Camus  Vladimir Lenin  and Jean Paul Sartre  as well as Anatole France  Friedrich Engels  H  G  Wells  and Robert Frost  31  As he grew older  he developed an interest in the Latin American writers Horacio Quiroga  Ciro Alegr a  Jorge Icaza  Rub n Dar o  and Miguel Asturias  31  Many of these authors  ideas he cataloged in his own handwritten notebooks of concepts  definitions  and philosophies of influential intellectuals  These included composing analytical sketches of Buddha and Aristotle  along with examining Bertrand Russell on love and patriotism  Jack London on society  and Nietzsche on the idea of death  Sigmund Freud s ideas fascinated him as he quoted him on a variety of topics from dreams and libido to narcissism and the oedipus complex  31  His favorite subjects in school included philosophy  mathematics  engineering  political science  sociology  history and archaeology  32  33  Years later  a February 13  1958  declassified CIA  biographical and personality report  would make note of Guevara s wide range of academic interests and intellect  describing him as  quite well read  while adding that  Che is fairly intellectual for a Latino   34  Motorcycle journey Main articles  The Motorcycle Diaries  book  and The Motorcycle Diaries  film  In 1948  Guevara entered the University of Buenos Aires to study medicine  His  hunger to explore the world  35  led him to intersperse his collegiate pursuits with two long introspective journeys that would fundamentally change the way he viewed himself and the contemporary economic conditions in Latin America  The first expedition in 1950 was a 4 500 kilometer  2 800 mi  solo trip through the rural provinces of northern Argentina on a bicycle on which he installed a small motor  36  This was followed in 1951 by a nine month 8 000 kilometer  5 000 mi  continental motorcycle trek through most of South America  For the latter  he took a year off from studies to embark with his friend Alberto Granado  with the final goal of spending a few weeks volunteering at the San Pablo Leper colony in Peru  on the banks of the Amazon River  A map of Guevara s 1952 trip with Alberto Granado  The red arrows correspond to air travel  Guevara  right  with Alberto Granado  left  aboard their  Mambo Tango  wooden raft on the Amazon River in June 1952  The raft was a gift from the lepers whom they had treated  37  In Chile  Guevara found himself enraged by the working conditions of the miners in Anaconda s Chuquicamata copper mine  and moved by his overnight encounter in the Atacama Desert with a persecuted communist couple who did not even own a blanket  describing them as  the shivering flesh and blood victims of capitalist exploitation   38  Additionally  on the way to Machu Picchu high in the Andes  he was struck by the crushing poverty of the remote rural areas  where peasant farmers worked small plots of land owned by wealthy landlords  39  Later on his journey  Guevara was especially impressed by the camaraderie among those living in a Leper Colony  stating  The highest forms of human solidarity and loyalty arise among such lonely and desperate people   39  Guevara used notes taken during this trip to write an account entitled The Motorcycle Diaries  which later became a New York Times best seller  40  and was adapted into a 2004 award winning film of the same name  In total  the journey took Guevara through Argentina  Chile  Peru  Ecuador  Colombia  Venezuela  Panama  and to Miami  before returning home to Buenos Aires  By trip s end  he came to view Latin America not as collection of separate nations  but as a single entity requiring a continent wide liberation strategy  His conception of a borderless  united Hispanic America sharing a common  Latino  heritage was a theme that prominently recurred during his later revolutionary activities  Upon returning to Argentina  he completed his studies and received his medical degree in June 1953  making him officially  Dr  Ernesto Guevara   41  42   A motorcycle journey the length of South America awakened him to the injustice of U S  domination in the hemisphere  and to the suffering colonialism brought to its original inhabitants     George Galloway  British politician  43  Guevara later remarked that through his travels of Latin America  he came in  close contact with poverty  hunger and disease  along with the  inability to treat a child because of lack of money  and  stupefaction provoked by the continual hunger and punishment  that leads a father to  accept the loss of a son as an unimportant accident   It was these experiences which Guevara cites as convincing him that in order to  help these people   he needed to leave the realm of medicine  and consider the political arena of armed struggle  9  Guatemala  Arbenz and United Fruit Main article  1954 Guatemalan coup d  tat A map of Che Guevara s travels between 1953 and 1956  including his journey aboard the Granma On July 7  1953  Guevara set out again  this time to Bolivia  Peru  Ecuador  Panama  Costa Rica  Nicaragua  Honduras and El Salvador  On December 10  1953  before leaving for Guatemala  Guevara sent an update to his Aunt Beatriz from San Jos   Costa Rica  In the letter Guevara speaks of traversing through the  dominions  of the United Fruit Company  which convinced him  how terrible  the  Capitalist octopuses  were  44  This affirmed indignation carried the  head hunting tone  that he adopted in order to frighten his more Conservative relatives  and ends with Guevara swearing on an image of the then recently deceased Joseph Stalin  not to rest until these  octopuses have been vanquished   45  Later that month  Guevara arrived in Guatemala where President Jacobo Arbenz Guzm n headed a democratically elected government that  through land reform and other initiatives  was attempting to end the latifundia system  To accomplish this  President Arbenz had enacted a major land reform program  where all uncultivated portions of large land holdings were to be expropriated and redistributed to landless peasants  The biggest land owner  and one most affected by the reforms  was the United Fruit Company  from which the Arbenz government had already taken more than 225 000 acres  910 km2  of uncultivated land  46  Pleased with the road the nation was heading down  Guevara decided to settle down in Guatemala so as to  perfect himself and accomplish whatever may be necessary in order to become a true revolutionary   47  In Guatemala City  Guevara sought out Hilda Gadea Acosta  a Peruvian economist who was well connected politically as a member of the left leaning Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana  APRA  American Popular Revolutionary Alliance   She introduced Guevara to a number of high level officials in the Arbenz government  Guevara then established contact with a group of Cuban exiles linked to Fidel Castro through the July 26  1953 attack on the Moncada Barracks in Santiago de Cuba  During this period he acquired his famous nickname  due to his frequent use of the Argentine diminutive interjection che  a vocative casual speech filler used to call attention or ascertain comprehension  similarly to both  bro  or the Canadian phrase  eh   48  Guevara s attempts to obtain a medical internship were unsuccessful and his economic situation was often precarious  On May 15  1954  a shipment of  koda infantry and light artillery weapons was sent from Communist Czechoslovakia for the Arbenz Government and arrived in Puerto Barrios  49  As a result  the U S  CIA sponsored an army which invaded the country and installed the right wing dictatorship of Carlos Castillo Armas  47  Guevara was eager to fight on behalf of Arbenz and joined an armed militia organized by the Communist Youth for that purpose  but frustrated with the group s inaction  he soon returned to medical duties  Following the coup  he again volunteered to fight  but soon after  Arbenz took refuge in the Mexican Embassy and told his foreign supporters to leave the country  Guevara s repeated calls to resist were noted by supporters of the coup  and he was marked for murder  50  After Hilda Gadea was arrested  Guevara sought protection inside the Argentine consulate  where he remained until he received a safe conduct pass some weeks later and made his way to Mexico  51  He married Gadea in Mexico in September 1955  52  The overthrow of the Arbenz regime cemented Guevara s view of the United States as an imperialist power that would oppose and attempt to destroy any government that sought to redress the socioeconomic inequality endemic to Latin America and other developing countries  In speaking about the coup Guevara stated   The last Latin American revolutionary democracy   that of Jacobo Arbenz   failed as a result of the cold premeditated aggression carried out by the U S A  Its visible head was the Secretary of State John Foster Dulles  a man who  through a rare coincidence  was also a stockholder and attorney for the United Fruit Company   50  Guevara s conviction that Marxism achieved through armed struggle and defended by an armed populace was the only way to rectify such conditions was thus strengthened  53  Gadea wrote later   It was Guatemala which finally convinced him of the necessity for armed struggle and for taking the initiative against imperialism  By the time he left  he was sure of this   54  Mexico City and preparation Guevara with Hilda Gadea at Chich n Itz  on their honeymoon trip Guevara arrived in Mexico City in early September 1954  and worked in the allergy section of the General Hospital  In addition he gave lectures on medicine at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and worked as a news photographer for Latina News Agency  55  His first wife Hilda notes in her memoir My Life with Che  that for a while  Guevara considered going to work as a doctor in Africa and that he continued to be deeply troubled by the poverty around him  56  In one instance  Hilda describes Guevara s obsession with an elderly washerwoman whom he was treating  remarking that he saw her as  representative of the most forgotten and exploited class   Hilda later found a poem that Che had dedicated to the old woman  containing  a promise to fight for a better world  for a better life for all the poor and exploited   56  During this time he renewed his friendship with  ico L pez and the other Cuban exiles whom he had met in Guatemala  In June 1955  L pez introduced him to Ra l Castro who subsequently introduced him to his older brother  Fidel Castro  the revolutionary leader who had formed the 26th of July Movement and was now plotting to overthrow the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista  During a long conversation with Fidel on the night of their first meeting  Guevara concluded that the Cuban s cause was the one for which he had been searching and before daybreak he had signed up as a member of the July 26 Movement  57  Despite their  contrasting personalities   from this point on Che and Fidel began to foster what dual biographer Simon Reid Henry deems a  revolutionary friendship that would change the world   as a result of their coinciding commitment to anti imperialism  58  By this point in Guevara s life  he deemed that U S  controlled conglomerates installed and supported repressive regimes around the world  In this vein  he considered Batista a  U S  puppet whose strings needed cutting   59  Although he planned to be the group s combat medic  Guevara participated in the military training with the members of the Movement  The key portion of training involved learning hit and run tactics of guerrilla warfare  Guevara and the others underwent arduous 15 hour marches over mountains  across rivers  and through the dense undergrowth  learning and perfecting the procedures of ambush and quick retreat  From the start Guevara was Alberto Bayo s  prize student  among those in training  scoring the highest on all of the tests given  60  At the end of the course  he was called  the best guerrilla of them all  by their instructor  General Bayo  61  Cuban Revolution Main articles  Cuban Revolution  Battle of Santa Clara  and Foco Invasion  warfare and Santa Clara Guevara atop a mule in Las Villas province  Cuba  November 1958 The first step in Castro s revolutionary plan was an assault on Cuba from Mexico via the Granma  an old  leaky cabin cruiser  They set out for Cuba on November 25  1956  Attacked by Batista s military soon after landing  many of the 82 men were either killed in the attack or executed upon capture  only 22 found each other afterwards  62  Guevara wrote that it was during this bloody confrontation that he laid down his medical supplies and picked up a box of ammunition dropped by a fleeing comrade  finalizing his symbolic transition from physician to combatant  Only a small band of revolutionaries survived to re group as a bedraggled fighting force deep in the Sierra Maestra mountains  where they received support from the urban guerrilla network of Frank Pa s  the 26th of July Movement  and local campesinos  With the group withdrawn to the Sierra  the world wondered whether Castro was alive or dead until early 1957 when the interview by Herbert Matthews appeared in The New York Times  The article presented a lasting  almost mythical image for Castro and the guerrillas  Guevara was not present for the interview  but in the coming months he began to realize the importance of the media in their struggle  Meanwhile  as supplies and morale diminished  and with an allergy to mosquito bites which resulted in agonizing walnut sized cysts on his body  63  Guevara considered these  the most painful days of the war   64  During Guevara s time living hidden among the poor subsistence farmers of the Sierra Maestra mountains  he discovered that there were no schools  no electricity  minimal access to healthcare  and more than 40 percent of the adults were illiterate  65  As the war continued  Guevara became an integral part of the rebel army and  convinced Castro with competence  diplomacy and patience   12  Guevara set up factories to make grenades  built ovens to bake bread  taught new recruits about tactics  and organized schools to teach illiterate campesinos to read and write  12  Moreover  Guevara established health clinics  workshops to teach military tactics  and a newspaper to disseminate information  66  The man who three years later would be dubbed by Time Magazine   Castro s brain   at this point was promoted by Fidel Castro to Comandante  commander  of a second army column  12  As the only other ranked Comandante besides Fidel Castro  Guevara was a harsh disciplinarian who sometimes shot defectors  Deserters were punished as traitors  and Guevara was known to send squads to track those seeking to go AWOL  67  As a result  Guevara became feared for his brutality and ruthlessness  68  During the guerrilla campaign  Guevara was also responsible for the sometimes summary execution of a number of men accused of being informers  deserters or spies  69  In his diaries  Guevara described the first such execution of Eutimio Guerra  a peasant army guide who admitted treason when it was discovered he accepted the promise of ten thousand pesos for repeatedly giving away the rebel s position for attack by the Cuban air force  70  Such information also allowed Batista s army to burn the homes of rebel friendly peasants  70  Upon Guerra s request that they  end his life quickly   70  Che stepped forward and shot him in the head  writing  The situation was uncomfortable for the people and for Eutimio so I ended the problem giving him a shot with a  32 pistol in the right side of the brain  with exit orifice in the right temporal  lobe    71  His scientific notations and matter of fact description  suggested to one biographer a  remarkable detachment to violence  by that point in the war  71  Later  Guevara published a literary account of the incident entitled  Death of a Traitor   where he transfigured Eutimio s betrayal and pre execution request that the revolution  take care of his children   into a  revolutionary parable about redemption through sacrifice   71  Smoking a pipe at his guerrilla base in the Escambray Mountains  Although he maintained a demanding and harsh disposition  Guevara also viewed his role of commander as one of a teacher  entertaining his men during breaks between engagements with readings from the likes of Robert Louis Stevenson  Cervantes  and Spanish lyric poets  72  Together with this role  and inspired by Jos  Mart  s principle of  literacy without borders   Guevara further ensured that his rebel fighters made daily time to teach the uneducated campesinos with whom they lived and fought to read and write  in what Guevara termed the  battle against ignorance   65  His commanding officer Fidel Castro has described Guevara as intelligent  daring  and an exemplary leader who  had great moral authority over his troops   73  Castro further remarked that Guevara took too many risks  even having a  tendency toward foolhardiness   74  Guevara s teenage lieutenant  Joel Iglesias  recounts such actions in his diary  noting that Guevara s behavior in combat even brought admiration from the enemy  On one occasion Iglesias recounts the time he had been wounded in battle  stating  Che ran out to me  defying the bullets  threw me over his shoulder  and got me out of there  The guards didn t dare fire at him     later they told me he made a great impression on them when they saw him run out with his pistol stuck in his belt  ignoring the danger  they didn t dare shoot   75  Guevara was instrumental in creating the clandestine radio station Radio Rebelde  Rebel Radio  in February 1958  which broadcast news to the Cuban people with statements by the 26th of July movement  and provided radiotelephone communication between the growing number of rebel columns across the island  Guevara had apparently been inspired to create the station by observing the effectiveness of CIA supplied radio in Guatemala in ousting the government of Jacobo Arbenz Guzm n  76  In late July 1958  Guevara played a critical role in the Battle of Las Mercedes by using his column to halt a force of 1 500 men called up by Batista s General Cantillo in a plan to encircle and destroy Castro s forces  Years later  Major Larry Bockman of the United States Marine Corps would analyze and describe Che s tactical appreciation of this battle as  brilliant   77  During this time Guevara also became an  expert  at leading hit and run tactics against Batista s army  and then fading back into the countryside before the army could counterattack  78  As the war extended  Guevara led a new column of fighters dispatched westward for the final push towards Havana  Travelling by foot  Guevara embarked on a difficult 7 week march only travelling at night to avoid ambush  and often not eating for several days  79  In the closing days of December 1958  Guevara s task was to cut the island in half by taking Las Villas province  In a matter of days he executed a series of  brilliant tactical victories  that gave him control of all but the province s capital city of Santa Clara  79  Guevara then directed his  suicide squad  in the attack on Santa Clara  that became the final decisive military victory of the revolution  80  81  In the six weeks leading up to the Battle of Santa Clara there were times when his men were completely surrounded  outgunned  and overrun  Che s eventual victory despite being outnumbered 10 1  remains in the view of some observers a  remarkable tour de force in modern warfare   82  After the battle of Santa Clara  January 1  1959 Radio Rebelde broadcast the first reports that Guevara s column had taken Santa Clara on New Year s Eve 1958  This contradicted reports by the heavily controlled national news media  which had at one stage reported Guevara s death during the fighting  At 3 am on January 1  1959  upon learning that his generals were negotiating a separate peace with Guevara  Fulgencio Batista boarded a plane in Havana and fled for the Dominican Republic  along with an amassed  fortune of more than   300 000 000 through graft and payoffs   83  The following day on January 2  Guevara entered Havana to take final control of the capital  84  Fidel Castro took 6 more days to arrive  as he stopped to rally support in several large cities on his way to rolling victoriously into Havana on January 8  1959  In mid January 1959  Guevara went to live at a summer villa in Tarara to recover from a violent asthma attack  85  While there he started the Tarara Group  a group that debated and formed the new plans for Cuba s social  political  and economic development  86  In addition  Che began to write his book Guerrilla Warfare while resting at Tarara  86  In February  the revolutionary government proclaimed Guevara  a Cuban citizen by birth  in recognition of his role in the triumph  87  When Hilda Gadea arrived in Cuba in late January  Guevara told her that he was involved with another woman  and the two agreed on a divorce  88  which was finalized on May 22  89  On June 2  1959  he married Aleida March  a Cuban born member of the 26th of July movement with whom he had been living since late 1958  Guevara returned to the seaside village of Tarara in June for his honeymoon with Aleida  90  Guevara had children from both his marriages  and one illegitimate child  as follows  With Hilda Gadea  married August 18  1955  divorced May 22  1959   Hilda Beatriz Guevara Gadea  born February 15  1956 in Mexico City  died August 21  1995 in Havana  Cuba  with Aleida March  married June 2  1959   Aleida Guevara March  born November 24  1960 in Havana  Cuba  Camilo Guevara March  born May 20  1962 in Havana  Cuba  Celia Guevara March  born June 14  1963 in Havana  Cuba  and Ernesto Guevara March  born February 24  1965 in Havana  Cuba  and with Lilia Rosa L pez  extramarital   Omar P rez  born March 19  1964 in Havana  Cuba  91  La Caba a  land reform  and literacy  right to left  Rebel leader Camilo Cienfuegos  Cuban President Manuel Urrutia  and Guevara  January 1959  The first major political crisis arose over what to do with the captured Batista officials who had been responsible for the worst of the repression  92  During the rebellion against Batista s dictatorship  the general command of the rebel army  led by Fidel Castro  introduced into the liberated territories the 19th century penal law commonly known as the Ley de la Sierra  Law of the Sierra   93  This law included the death penalty for extremely serious crimes  whether perpetrated by the Batista regime or by supporters of the revolution  In 1959  the revolutionary government extended its application to the whole of the republic and to those it considered war criminals  captured and tried after the revolution  According to the Cuban Ministry of Justice  this latter extension was supported by the majority of the population  and followed the same procedure as those in the Nuremberg Trials held by the Allies after World War II  94  To implement a portion of this plan  Castro named Guevara commander of the La Caba a Fortress prison  for a five month tenure  January 2 through June 12  1959   95  Guevara was charged with purging the Batista army and consolidating victory by exacting  revolutionary justice  against those considered to be traitors  chivatos  informants  or war criminals  96  Serving in the post as commander of La Caba a  Guevara reviewed the appeals of those convicted during the revolutionary tribunal process  13  On some occasions the penalty delivered by the tribunal was death by firing squad  97  Ra l G mez Treto  senior legal advisor to the Cuban Ministry of Justice  has argued that the death penalty was justified in order to prevent citizens themselves from taking justice into their own hands  as happened twenty years earlier in the anti Machado rebellion  98  Biographers note that in January 1959  the Cuban public was in a  lynching mood   99  and point to a survey at the time showing 93  public approval for the tribunal process  13  Moreover  a January 22  1959  Universal Newsreel broadcast in the U S  and narrated by Ed Herlihy  featured Fidel Castro asking an estimated one million Cubans whether they approved of the executions  and was met with a roaring   Si    yes   100  With 20 000 Cubans estimated to have been killed at the hands of Batista s collaborators  101  and many of the war criminals sentenced to death accused of torture and physical atrocities  13  the newly empowered government carried out executions  punctuated by cries from the crowds of   pared n    to the wall   92  which biographer Jorge Casta eda describes as  without respect for due process   102   I have yet to find a single credible source pointing to a case where Che executed  an innocent   Those persons executed by Guevara or on his orders were condemned for the usual crimes punishable by death at times of war or in its aftermath  desertion  treason or crimes such as rape  torture or murder  I should add that my research spanned five years  and included anti Castro Cubans among the Cuban American exile community in Miami and elsewhere     Jon Lee Anderson  author of Che Guevara  A Revolutionary Life  PBS forum  103  Although there are varying accounts  it is estimated that several hundred people were executed nationwide during this time  with Guevara s jurisdictional death total at La Caba a ranging from 55 to 105  see reference   104  Conflicting views exist of Guevara s attitude towards the executions at La Caba a  Some exiled opposition biographers report that he relished the rituals of the firing squad  and organized them with gusto  while others relate that Guevara pardoned as many prisoners as he could  102  What is acknowledged by all sides is that Guevara had become a  hardened  man  who had no qualms about the death penalty or summary and collective trials  If the only way to  defend the revolution was to execute its enemies  he would not be swayed by humanitarian or political arguments   102  This is further confirmed by a February 5  1959  letter to Luis Paredes L pez in Buenos Aires where Guevara states unequivocally  The executions by firing squads are not only a necessity for the people of Cuba  but also an imposition of the people   105  Along with ensuring  revolutionary justice   the other key early platform of Guevara s was establishing agrarian land reform  Almost immediately after the success of the revolution on January 27  1959  Guevara made one of his most significant speeches where he talked about  the social ideas of the rebel army   During this speech  he declared that the main concern of the new Cuban government was  the social justice that land redistribution brings about   106  A few months later on May 17  1959  the Agrarian Reform Law crafted by Guevara went into effect  limiting the size of all farms to 1 000 acres  4 0 km2   Any holdings over these limits were expropriated by the government and either redistributed to peasants in 67 acre  270 000 m2  parcels or held as state run communes  107  The law also stipulated that sugar plantations could not be owned by foreigners  108  Guevara in his trademark olive green military fatigues and beret  On June 12  1959  Castro sent Guevara out on a three month tour of 14 mostly Bandung Pact countries  Morocco  Sudan  Egypt  Syria  Pakistan  India  Sri Lanka  Burma  Thailand  Indonesia  Japan  Yugoslavia  Greece  and the cities of Singapore and Hong Kong  109  Sending Guevara away from Havana allowed Castro to appear to be distancing himself from Guevara and his Marxist sympathies  which troubled both the United States and some of Castro s July 26 Movement members  110  Guevara spent 12 days in Japan  July 15 27   participating in negotiations aimed at expanding Cuba s trade relations with that nation  During the visit  he refused to visit and lay a wreath at Japan s Tomb of the Unknown Soldier commemorating soldiers lost during World War II  remarking that the Japanese  imperialists  had  killed millions of Asians   111  In its place  Guevara stated that he would instead visit Hiroshima  where the American military had detonated an atom bomb 14 years earlier  111  Despite his denunciation of Imperial Japan  Guevara also considered President Truman a  macabre clown  for the bombings  112  and after visiting Hiroshima and its Peace Memorial Museum  he sent back a postcard to Cuba stating  In order to fight better for peace  one must look at Hiroshima   113  Upon Guevara s return to Cuba in September 1959  it was evident that Castro now had more political power  The government had begun land seizures included in the agrarian reform law  but was hedging on compensation offers to landowners  instead offering low interest  bonds   a step which put the U S  on alert  At this point the affected wealthy cattlemen of Camag ey mounted a campaign against the land redistributions  and enlisted the newly disaffected rebel leader Huber Matos  who along with the anti Communist wing of the 26th of July Movement  joined them in denouncing the  Communist encroachment   114  During this time Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo was offering assistance to the  Anti Communist Legion of the Caribbean  which was training in the Dominican Republic  This multi national force  composed mostly of Spaniards and Cubans  but also of Croatians  Germans  Greeks  and right wing mercenaries  was plotting to topple Castro s new regime  114  Guevara in 1960  walking through the streets of Havana with his wife Aleida March  right   Such threats were heightened when  on March 4  1960  two massive explosions ripped through the French freighter La Coubre  which was carrying Belgian munitions from the port of Antwerp  and was docked in Havana Harbor  The blasts killed at least 76 people and injured several hundred  with Guevara personally providing first aid to some of the victims  Cuban leader Fidel Castro immediately accused the CIA of  an act of terrorism  and held a state funeral the following day for the victims of the blast  115  It was at the memorial service that Alberto Korda took the famous photograph of Guevara  now known as Guerrillero Heroico  116  These perceived threats prompted Castro to further eliminate  counter revolutionaries   and to utilize Guevara to drastically increase the speed of land reform  To implement this plan  a new government agency  the National Institute of Agrarian Reform  INRA   was established to administer the new Agrarian Reform law  INRA quickly became the most important governing body in the nation  with Guevara serving as its head in his capacity as minister of industries  108  Under Guevara s command  INRA established its own 100 000 person militia  used first to help the government seize control of the expropriated land and supervise its distribution  and later to set up cooperative farms  The land confiscated included 480 000 acres  1 900 km2  owned by U S  corporations  108  Months later  as retaliation  U S President Dwight D  Eisenhower sharply reduced U S  imports of Cuban sugar  Cuba s main cash crop   thus leading Guevara on July 10  1960  to address over 100 000 workers in front of the Presidential Palace at a rally called to denounce U S   economic aggression   117  Along with land reform  one of the primary areas that Guevara stressed needed national improvement was in the area of literacy  Before 1959 the official literacy rate for Cuba was between 60 76   with educational access in rural areas and a lack of instructors the main determining factors  118  As a result  the Cuban government at Guevara s behest dubbed 1961 the  year of education   and mobilized over 100 000 volunteers into  literacy brigades   who were then sent out into the countryside to construct schools  train new educators  and teach the predominately illiterate Guajiros  peasants  to read and write  65  118  Unlike many of Guevara s later economic initiatives  this campaign was  a remarkable success   118  By the completion of the Cuban Literacy Campaign  707 212 adults had been taught to read and write  raising the national literacy rate to 96   118   Guevara was like a father to me     he educated me  He taught me to think  He taught me the most beautiful thing which is to be human     Urbano  aka Leonardo Tamayo   fought with Guevara in Cuba and Bolivia  119  Accompanying literacy  Guevara was also concerned with establishing universal access to higher education  To accomplish this  the new regime introduced affirmative action to the universities  120  While announcing this new commitment  Guevara told the gathered faculty and students at the University of Las Villas that the days when education was  a privilege of the white middle class  had ended   The University  he said   must paint itself black  mulatto  worker  and peasant   If it did not  he warned  the people would break down its doors  and paint the University the colors they like   120  The  New Man   Bay of Pigs and Missile Crisis Main articles  Bay of Pigs Invasion and Cuban Missile Crisis  Man truly achieves his full human condition when he produces without being compelled by the physical necessity of selling himself as a commodity     Che Guevara  Man and Socialism in Cuba  121  At this stage  Guevara acquired the additional position of Finance Minister  as well as President of the National Bank  These appointments  combined with his existing position as Minister of Industries  placed Guevara at the zenith of his power  as the  virtual czar  of the Cuban economy  117  As a consequence of his position at the head of the central bank  it was now Guevara s duty to sign the Cuban currency  which per custom would bear his signature  Instead of using his full name  he signed the bills solely  Che   122  It was through this symbolic act  which horrified many in the Cuban financial sector  that Guevara signaled his distaste for money and the class distinctions it brought about  122  Guevara s long time friend Ricardo Rojo later remarked that  the day he signed Che on the bills   he  literally knocked the props from under the widespread belief that money was sacred   123  Meeting with French existentialist philosophers Jean Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir in March 1960  In addition to Spanish  Guevara was fluent in French  124  Guevara s first desired economic goal  which coincided with his aversion for wealth condensation and economic inequality  was to see a nation wide elimination of material incentives in favor of moral ones  He viewed capitalism as a  contest among wolves  where  one can only win at the cost of others   and thus desired to see the creation of a  new man and woman   125  Guevara continually stressed that a socialist economy in itself is not  worth the effort  sacrifice  and risks of war and destruction  if it ends up encouraging  greed and individual ambition at the expense of collective spirit   126  A primary goal of Guevara s thus became to reform  individual consciousness  and values to produce better workers and citizens  126  In his view  Cuba s  new man  would be able to overcome the  egotism  and  selfishness  that he loathed and discerned was uniquely characteristic of individuals in capitalist societies  126  In describing this new method of  development   Guevara stated   There is a great difference between free enterprise development and revolutionary development  In one of them  wealth is concentrated in the hands of a fortunate few  the friends of the government  the best wheeler dealers  In the other  wealth is the people s patrimony   127  A further integral part of fostering a sense of  unity between the individual and the mass   Guevara believed  was volunteer work and will  To display this  Guevara  led by example   working  endlessly at his ministry job  in construction  and even cutting sugar cane  on his day off  128  He was known for working 36 hours at a stretch  calling meetings after midnight  and eating on the run  126  Such behavior was emblematic of Guevara s new program of moral incentives  where each worker was now required to meet a quota and produce a certain quantity of goods  As a replacement for the pay increases abolished by Guevara  workers who exceeded their quota now only received a certificate of commendation  while workers who failed to meet their quotas were given a pay cut  126  Guevara unapologetically defended his personal philosophy towards motivation and work  stating  Guevara fishing off the coast of Havana  on May 15  1960  Along with Castro  Guevara competed with expatriate author Ernest Hemingway at what was known as the  Hemingway Fishing Contest    This is not a matter of how many pounds of meat one might be able to eat  or how many times a year someone can go to the beach  or how many ornaments from abroad one might be able to buy with his current salary  What really matters is that the individual feels more complete  with much more internal richness and much more responsibility   129  In the face of a loss of commercial connections with Western states  Guevara tried to replace them with closer commercial relationships with Eastern Bloc states  visiting a number of Marxist states and signing trade agreements with them  At the end of 1960 he visited Czechoslovakia  the Soviet Union  North Korea  Hungary and East Germany and signed  for instance  a trade agreement in East Berlin on December 17  1960  130  Such agreements helped Cuba s economy to a certain degree but also had the disadvantage of a growing economic dependency on the Eastern Bloc  It was also in East Germany where Guevara met Tamara Bunke  later known as  Tania    who was assigned as his interpreter  and who would years later join him and be killed with him in Bolivia  Whatever the merits or demerits of Guevara s economic principles  his programs were unsuccessful  131  Guevara s program of  moral incentives  for workers caused a rapid drop in productivity and a rapid rise in absenteeism  132  In reference to the collective failings of Guevara s vision  reporter I F  Stone who interviewed Guevara twice during this time  remarked that he was  Galahad not Robespierre   while opining that  in a sense he was  like some early saint  taking refuge in the desert  Only there could the purity of the faith be safeguarded from the unregenerate revisionism of human nature   133  On April 17  1961  1 400 U S  trained Cuban exiles invaded Cuba during the Bay of Pigs Invasion  Guevara did not play a key role in the fighting  as one day before the invasion a warship carrying Marines faked an invasion off the West Coast of Pinar del R o and drew forces commanded by Guevara to that region  However  historians give him a share of credit for the victory as he was director of instruction for Cuba s armed forces at the time  14  Author Tad Szulc in his explanation of the Cuban victory  assigns Guevara partial credit  stating   The revolutionaries won because Che Guevara  as the head of the Instruction Department of the Revolutionary Armed Forces in charge of the militia training program  had done so well in preparing 200 000 men and women for war   14  It was also during this deployment that he suffered a bullet grazing to the cheek when his pistol fell out of its holster and accidentally discharged  134  Guevara  left  and Fidel Castro  photographed by Alberto Korda in 1961 In August 1961  during an economic conference of the Organization of American States in Punta del Este  Uruguay  Che Guevara sent a note of  gratitude  to U S  President John F  Kennedy through Richard N  Goodwin  a young secretary of the White House  It read  Thanks for Playa Gir n  Bay of Pigs   Before the invasion  the revolution was shaky  Now it s stronger than ever   135  In response to U S  Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon presenting the Alliance for Progress for ratification by the meeting  Guevara antagonistically attacked the United States claim of being a  democracy   stating that such a system was not compatible with  financial oligarchy  discrimination against blacks  and outrages by the Ku Klux Klan   136  Guevara continued  speaking out against the  persecution  that in his view  drove scientists like Oppenheimer from their posts  deprived the world for years of the marvelous voice of Paul Robeson  and sent the Rosenbergs to their deaths against the protests of a shocked world   136  Guevara ended his remarks by insinuating that the United States was not interested in real reforms  sardonically quipping that  U S  experts never talk about agrarian reform  they prefer a safe subject  like a better water supply  In short they seem to prepare the revolution of the toilets   31  Guevara  who was practically the architect of the Soviet Cuban relationship  137  then played a key role in bringing to Cuba the Soviet nuclear armed ballistic missiles that precipitated the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 and brought the world to the brink of nuclear war  138  A few weeks after the crisis  during an interview with the British communist newspaper the Daily Worker  Guevara was still fuming over the perceived Soviet betrayal and told correspondent Sam Russell that  if the missiles had been under Cuban control  they would have fired them off  139  While expounding on the incident later  Guevara reiterated that the cause of socialist liberation against global  imperialist aggression   would ultimately have been worth the possibility of  millions of atomic war victims   140  The missile crisis further convinced Guevara that the two World s superpowers  the United States and the Soviet Union  used Cuba as a pawn in their own global strategies  Afterward he denounced the Soviets almost as frequently as he denounced the Americans  141  International diplomacy A world map displaying those countries lived in or visited by Che Guevara in red  The three nations where he engaged in armed revolution are signified in green  By December 1964  Che Guevara had emerged as a  revolutionary statesman of world stature  and thus traveled to New York City as head of the Cuban delegation to speak at the United Nations  123  During his impassioned address  he criticized the United Nations inability to confront the  brutal policy of apartheid  in South Africa  proclaiming  can the United Nations do nothing to stop this   142  Guevara then denounced the United States policy towards their black population  stating   Those who kill their own children and discriminate daily against them because of the color of their skin  those who let the murderers of blacks remain free  protecting them  and furthermore punishing the black population because they demand their legitimate rights as free men how can those who do this consider themselves guardians of freedom   142  An indignant Guevara ended his speech by reciting the Second Declaration of Havana  decreeing Latin America a  family of 200 million brothers who suffer the same miseries   142  This  epic   Guevara declared  would be written by the  hungry Indian masses  peasants without land  exploited workers  and progressive masses   To Guevara the conflict was a struggle of mass and ideas  which would be carried forth by those  mistreated and scorned by imperialism  who were previously considered  a weak and submissive flock   With this  flock   Guevara now asserted   Yankee monopoly capitalism  now terrifyingly saw their  gravediggers   142  It would be during this  hour of vindication  Guevara pronounced  that the  anonymous mass  would begin to write its own history  with its own blood   and reclaim those  rights that were laughed at by one and all for 500 years   Guevara ended his remarks to the United Nations general assembly by hypothesizing that this  wave of anger  would  sweep the lands of Latin America   and that the labor masses who  turn the wheel of history   for the first time were  awakening from the long  brutalizing sleep to which they had been subjected  142  Guevara later learned that there were two failed attempts on his life by Cuban exiles during his stop at the U N  complex  143  The first from Molly Gonzales who tried to break through barricades upon his arrival with a seven inch hunting knife  and later during his address by Guillermo Novo with a timer initiated bazooka that was fired off target from a boat in the East River at the United Nations Headquarters  143  144  Afterwards  Guevara commented on both incidents stating that  it is better to be killed by a woman with a knife than by a man with a gun   while adding with a languid wave of his cigar that the explosion had  given the whole thing more flavor   143  While in New York City  Guevara also appeared on the CBS Sunday news program Face the Nation and met with a range of people  from U S  Senator Eugene McCarthy 145  to associates of Malcolm X  Malcolm X expressed his admiration  declaring Guevara  one of the most revolutionary men in this country right now  while reading a statement from him to a crowd at the Audubon Ballroom  146  Walking through Red Square in Moscow  November 1964 On December 17  Guevara left for Paris  France and from there embarked on a three month world tour that included vists to the People s Republic of China  North Korea  the United Arab Republic  Egypt   Algeria  Ghana  Guinea  Mali  Dahomey  Congo Brazzaville and Tanzania  with stops in Ireland and Prague  While in Ireland  Guevara embraced his own Irish heritage  celebrating Saint Patrick s Day in Limerick City  147  He wrote to his father on this visit  humorously stating  I am in this green Ireland of your ancestors  When they found out  the television  station  came to ask me about the Lynch genealogy  but in case they were horse thieves or something like that  I didn t say much   148  During this voyage  he wrote a letter to Carlos Quijano  editor of a Uruguayan weekly  which was later re titled Socialism and Man in Cuba  125  Outlined in the treatise was Guevara s summons for the creation of a new consciousness  status of work  and role of the individual  He also laid out the reasoning behind his anti capitalist sentiments  stating   The laws of capitalism  blind and invisible to the majority  act upon the individual without his thinking about it  He sees only the vastness of a seemingly infinite horizon before him  That is how it is painted by capitalist propagandists  who purport to draw a lesson from the example of Rockefeller whether or not it is true about the possibilities of success  The amount of poverty and suffering required for the emergence of a Rockefeller  and the amount of depravity that the accumulation of a fortune of such magnitude entails  are left out of the picture  and it is not always possible to make the people in general see this   125  Guevara ended the essay by declaring that  the true revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love  and beckoning on all revolutionaries to  strive every day so that this love of living humanity will be transformed into acts that serve as examples   thus becoming  a moving force   125  The genesis for Guevara s assertions relied on the fact that he believed the example of the Cuban Revolution was  something spiritual that would transcend all borders   31  Algiers  the Soviets and China In Algiers  Algeria on February 24  1965  Guevara made what turned out to be his last public appearance on the international stage when he delivered a speech at an economic seminar on Afro Asian solidarity  149  He specified the moral duty of the socialist countries  accusing them of tacit complicity with the exploiting Western countries  He proceeded to outline a number of measures which he said the communist bloc countries must implement in order to accomplish the defeat of imperialism  150  Having criticized the Soviet Union  the primary financial backer of Cuba  in such a public manner  he returned to Cuba on March 14 to a solemn reception by Fidel and Ra l Castro  Osvaldo Dortic s and Carlos Rafael Rodr guez at the Havana airport  As revealed in his last public speech in Algiers  Guevara had come to view the Northern Hemisphere  led by the U S  in the West and the Soviet Union in the East  as the exploiter of the Southern Hemisphere  He strongly supported Communist North Vietnam in the Vietnam War  and urged the peoples of other developing countries to take up arms and create  many Vietnams   151  Moreover  the coincidence of Guevara s views with those expounded by the Chinese Communist leadership under Mao Zedong was increasingly problematic for Cuba as the nation s economy became more and more dependent on the Soviet Union  Since the early days of the Cuban revolution  Guevara had been considered by many an advocate of Maoist strategy in Latin America and the originator of a plan for the rapid industrialization of Cuba which was frequently compared to China s  Great Leap Forward   Castro became weary of Guevara s opposition to Soviet conditions and recommendations  measures that Castro saw as necessary  but which Guevara described as corrupt and  pre monopolist   152   Marx characterized the psychological or philosophical manifestation of capitalist social relations as alienation and antagonism  the result of the commodification of labor and the operation of the law of value  For Guevara  the challenge was to replace the individuals  alienation from the productive process  and the antagonism generated by class relations  with integration and solidarity  developing a collective attitude to production and the concept of work as a social duty     Helen Yaffe  author of Che Guevara  The Economics of Revolution  153  In Guevara s private writings from this time  since released   he displays his growing criticism of the Soviet political economy  believing that they had  forgotten Marx   153  This led Guevara to denounce a range of Soviet practices including what he saw as their attempt to  air brush the inherent violence of class struggle integral to the transition from capitalism to socialism   their  dangerous  policy of peaceful co existence with the United States  their failure to push for a  change in consciousness  towards the idea of work  and their attempt to  liberalise  the socialist economy  153  It was Guevara s desire to see the complete elimination of money  interest  commodity production  the market economy  and  mercantile relationships   all conditions that the Soviets argued would only disappear when world communism was achieved  153  Disagreeing with this incrementalist approach  Guevara s critique of the Soviet Manual of Political Economy was encapsulated with him correctly predicting that since the Soviets were not willing to abolish the law of value  as Guevara desired   they would eventually return to capitalism  153  Two weeks after his Algiers speech  Guevara dropped out of public life and then vanished altogether  His whereabouts were a great mystery in Cuba  as he was generally regarded as second in power to Castro himself  His disappearance was variously attributed to the failure of the industrialization scheme he had advocated while minister of industry  to pressure exerted on Castro by Soviet officials disapproving of Guevara s pro Chinese Communist stance on the Sino Soviet split  and to serious differences between Guevara and the pragmatic Castro regarding Cuba s economic development and ideological line  Pressed by international speculation regarding Guevara s fate  Castro stated on June 16  1965 that the people would be informed when Guevara himself wished to let them know  Still  rumors spread both inside and outside Cuba  On October 3  1965  Castro publicly revealed an undated letter purportedly written to him by Guevara some months earlier  in it  Guevara reaffirmed his enduring solidarity with the Cuban Revolution  but declared his intention to leave Cuba to fight for the revolutionary cause abroad  Additionally  he resigned from all his positions in the government and party  and renounced his honorary Cuban citizenship  154  Congo A 37 year old Guevara holding an African baby and standing with a fellow Afro Cuban soldier in the Congo Crisis  1965  In early 1965  Guevara went to Africa to offer his knowledge and experience as a guerrilla to the ongoing conflict in the Congo  According to Algerian President Ahmed Ben Bella  Guevara thought that Africa was imperialism s weak link and therefore had enormous revolutionary potential  155  Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser  who had fraternal relations with Che dating back to his 1959 visit  saw Guevara s plans to fight in the Congo as  unwise  and warned that he would become a  Tarzan  figure  doomed to failure  156  Despite the warning  Guevara traveled to the Congo while using the alias Ram n Ben tez  157  Guevara led the Cuban operation in support of the Marxist Simba movement  which had emerged from the ongoing Congo Crisis  Guevara  his second in command Victor Dreke  and 12 other Cuban expeditionaries arrived in the Congo on April 24  1965 and a contingent of approximately 100 Afro Cubans joined them soon afterward  158  159  They collaborated for a time with guerrilla leader Laurent D sir  Kabila  who had previously helped supporters of the overthrown Patrice Lumumba lead an unsuccessful revolt months earlier  As an admirer of the late Lumumba  Guevara declared that his  murder should be a lesson for all of us   160  Guevara  with limited knowledge of Swahili and the local languages was assigned a teenage interpreter Freddy Ilanga  Over the course of seven months Ilanga grew to  admire the hard working Guevara   who according to Mr  Ilanga   showed the same respect to black people as he did to whites   161  However  Guevara soon became disillusioned with the discipline of Kabila s troops and later dismissed him  stating  nothing leads me to believe he is the man of the hour   162  As an additional obstacle  white South African mercenaries  led by Mike Hoare in concert with Cuban exiles and the CIA  worked with the Congo National Army to thwart Guevara in the mountains near the village of Fizi on Lake Tanganyika  They were able to monitor his communications  and so pre empted his attacks and interdicted his supply lines  Despite the fact that Guevara sought to conceal his presence in the Congo  the U S  government was aware of his location and activities  The National Security Agency was intercepting all of his incoming and outgoing transmissions via equipment aboard the USNS Private Jose F  Valdez  T AG 169   a floating listening post that continuously cruised the Indian Ocean off Dar es Salaam for that purpose  163  Listening to a Zenith Trans Oceanic shortwave receiver are  seated from the left  Rogelio Oliva  Jos  Mar a Mart nez Tamayo  known as  Mbili  in the Congo and  Ricardo  in Bolivia   and Guevara  Standing behind them is Roberto S nchez   Lawton  in Cuba and  Changa  in the Congo   Guevara s aim was to export the revolution by instructing local anti Mobutu Simba fighters in Marxist ideology and foco theory strategies of guerrilla warfare  In his Congo Diary  he cites the incompetence  intransigence and infighting of the local Congolese forces as key reasons for the revolt s failure  164  Later that year on November 20  1965  in ill health with dysentery  suffering from acute asthma  and disheartened after seven months of frustration and inactivity  Guevara left the Congo with the Cuban survivors  Six members of his 12 man column had died   At one point Guevara considered sending the wounded back to Cuba  and fighting in Congo alone until his death  as a revolutionary example  after being urged by his comrades and pressed by two emissaries sent by Castro  at the last moment he reluctantly agreed to leave Africa  In speaking about his experience in the Congo months later  Guevara concluded that he left rather than fight to the death because   The human element failed  There is no will to fight  The leaders are corrupt  In a word    there was nothing to do   165  Guevara also declared that  we can t liberate by ourselves a country that does not want to fight   166  A few weeks later  when writing the preface to the diary he kept during the Congo venture  he began   This is the history of a failure   167  Guevara was reluctant to return to Cuba  because Castro had made public Guevara s  farewell letter  a letter intended to only be revealed in the case of his death wherein he severed all ties in order to devote himself to revolution throughout the world  168  As a result  Guevara spent the next six months living clandestinely in Dar es Salaam and Prague  169  During this time he compiled his memoirs of the Congo experience  and wrote drafts of two more books  one on philosophy and the other on economics  He then visited several Western European countries to test his new false identity papers  created by Cuban Intelligence for his later travels to South America  As Guevara prepared for Bolivia  he secretly traveled back to Cuba to visit Castro  as well as to see his wife and to write a last letter to his five children to be read upon his death  which ended with him instructing them   Above all  always be capable of feeling deeply any injustice committed against anyone  anywhere in the world  This is the most beautiful quality in a revolutionary   170  Bolivia Main article   ancahuaz  Guerrilla In late 1966  Guevara s location was still not public knowledge  although representatives of Mozambique s independence movement  the FRELIMO  reported that they met with Guevara in late 1966 or early 1967 in Dar es Salaam regarding his offer to aid in their revolutionary project  which they ultimately rejected  171  In a speech at the 1967 International Workers  Day rally in Havana  the Acting Minister of the armed forces  Major Juan Almeida  announced that Guevara was  serving the revolution somewhere in Latin America   Before he departed for Bolivia  Guevara altered his appearance by shaving off his beard and part of the top of his head as well as dying the rest of his hair grey so he would be unrecognizable as Che Guevara  172  On November 3  1966  Guevara secretly arrived in La Paz  Bolivia on a flight from Montevideo  Uruguay under the false name Adolfo Mena Gonz lez  and posed as a middle aged Uruguayan businessman working for the Organization of American States  173  Guevara in rural Bolivia  shortly before his death  1967  Guevara s first base camp was located in the montane dry forest in the remote  ancahuaz  region  Training at the camp in the  ancahuaz  valley proved to be hazardous and little was accomplished in the way of building a guerrilla army  Former Stasi operative Hayd e Tamara Bunke Bider  better known by her nom de guerre  Tania   who had been installed as his primary agent in La Paz  was reportedly also working for the KGB and in several Western sources she is inferred to have unwittingly served Soviet interests by leading Bolivian authorities to Guevara s trail  174  175  Guevara s guerrilla force  numbering about 50 176  and operating as the ELN  Ej rcito de Liberaci n Nacional de Bolivia   National Liberation Army of Bolivia    was well equipped and scored a number of early successes against Bolivian army regulars in the difficult terrain of the mountainous Camiri region  As a result of Guevara s units winning several skirmishes against Bolivian troops in the spring and summer of 1967  the Bolivian government began to overestimate the true size of the guerrilla force  177  But in September  the Army managed to eliminate two guerrilla groups in a violent battle  reportedly killing one of the leaders  Location of Vallegrande in Bolivia Researchers hypothesize that Guevara s plan for fomenting revolution in Bolivia failed for an array of reasons  He had expected to deal only with the Bolivian military  who were poorly trained and equipped  and was unaware that the U S  government had sent a team of the CIA s Special Activities Division commandos and other operatives into Bolivia to aid the anti insurrection effort  The Bolivian Army would also be trained  advised  and supplied by U S  Army Special Forces including a recently organized elite battalion of Rangers trained in jungle warfare that set up camp in La Esperanza  a small settlement close to the location of Guevara s guerrillas  178  Guevara had expected assistance and cooperation from the local dissidents which he did not receive  nor did he receive support from Bolivia s Communist Party  under the leadership of Mario Monje  which was oriented toward Moscow rather than Havana  In Guevara s own diary captured after his death  he wrote about the Communist Party of Bolivia  which he characterized as  distrustful  disloyal and stupid   179  He had expected to remain in radio contact with Havana  The two shortwave transmitters provided to him by Cuba were faulty  thus the guerrillas were unable to communicate with and be resupplied  leaving them isolated and stranded  In addition  Guevara s known preference for confrontation rather than compromise  which had previously surfaced during his guerrilla warfare campaign in Cuba  contributed to his inability to develop successful working relationships with local leaders in Bolivia  just as it had in the Congo  180  This tendency had existed in Cuba  but had been kept in check by the timely interventions and guidance of Fidel Castro  181  The end result was that Guevara was unable to attract inhabitants of the local area to join his militia during the 11 months he attempted recruitment  Near the end of the venture Guevara wrote in his diary that  the peasants do not give us any help  and they are turning into informers   182  Capture and execution  There was no person more feared by the company  CIA  than Che Guevara because he had the capacity and charisma necessary to direct the struggle against the political repression of the traditional hierarchies in power in the countries of Latin America     Philip Agee  CIA agent  later defected to Cuba  183  F lix Rodr guez  a Cuban exile turned CIA Special Activities Division operative  advised Bolivian troops during the hunt for Guevara in Bolivia  184  In addition  the 2007 documentary My Enemy s Enemy  directed by Kevin Macdonald  alleges that Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie aka  The Butcher of Lyon   advised and possibly helped the CIA orchestrate Guevara s eventual capture  185  On October 7  1967  an informant apprised the Bolivian Special Forces of the location of Guevara s guerrilla encampment in the Yuro ravine  186  On October 8  they encircled the area with 1 800 soldiers  and Guevara was wounded and taken prisoner while leading a detachment with Sime n Cuba Sarabia  Che biographer Jon Lee Anderson reports Bolivian Sergeant Bernardino Huanca s account  that a twice wounded Guevara  his gun rendered useless  shouted  Do not shoot  I am Che Guevara and worth more to you alive than dead   187  Monument to Guevara in La Higuera Guevara was tied up and taken to a dilapidated mud schoolhouse in the nearby village of La Higuera on the night of October 8  For the next half day  Guevara refused to be interrogated by Bolivian officers and would only speak quietly to Bolivian soldiers  One of those Bolivian soldiers  helicopter pilot Jaime Nino de Guzman  describes Che as looking  dreadful   According to Guzman  Guevara was shot through the right calf  his hair was matted with dirt  his clothes were shredded  and his feet were covered in rough leather sheaths  Despite his haggard appearance  he recounts that  Che held his head high  looked everyone straight in the eyes and asked only for something to smoke   De Guzman states that he  took pity  and gave him a small bag of tobacco for his pipe  and that Guevara then smiled and thanked him  188  Later on the night of October 8  Guevara  despite having his hands tied  kicked Bolivian Officer Espinosa into the wall  after the officer entered the schoolhouse and tried to snatch Guevara s pipe from his mouth as a souvenir while he was still smoking it  189  In another instance of defiance  Guevara spat in the face of Bolivian Rear Admiral Ugarteche shortly before his execution  189  The following morning on October 9  Guevara asked to see the  maestra   school teacher  of the village  22 year old Julia Cortez  Cortez would later state that she found Guevara to be an  agreeable looking man with a soft and ironic glance  and that during their conversation she found herself  unable to look him in the eye   because his  gaze was unbearable  piercing  and so tranquil   189  During their short conversation  Guevara pointed out to Cortez the poor condition of the schoolhouse  stating that it was  anti pedagogical  to expect campesino students to be educated there  while  government officials drive Mercedes cars      declaring  that s what we are fighting against   189  Later that morning on October 9  Bolivian President Ren  Barrientos ordered that Guevara be killed  The order was relayed by F lix Rodr guez despite the U S  government s desire that Guevara be taken to Panama for further interrogation  190  The executioner was Mario Ter n  a half drunken sergeant in the Bolivian army who had requested to shoot Che on the basis of the fact that three of his friends from B Company  all named  Mario   had been killed in an earlier firefight with Guevara s band of guerrillas  13  To make the bullet wounds appear consistent with the story the government planned to release to the public  F lix Rodr guez ordered Ter n to aim carefully to make it appear that Guevara had been killed in action during a clash with the Bolivian army  191  Gary Prado  the Bolivian captain in command of the army company that captured Guevara  said that the reasons Barrientos ordered the immediate execution of Guevara is so there would be no possibility that Guevara would escape from prison  and also so there would be no drama in regard to a trial  192  A few minutes before Guevara was executed  he was asked by a Bolivian soldier if he was thinking about his own immortality   No   he replied   I m thinking about the immortality of the revolution   193  When Sergeant Ter n entered the hut  Che Guevara then told his executioner   I know you ve come to kill me  Shoot  coward  You are only going to kill a man   194  Ter n hesitated  then opened fire with his semiautomatic rifle  hitting Guevara in the arms and legs  Guevara writhed on the ground  apparently biting one of his wrists to avoid crying out  Ter n then fired several times again  wounding him fatally in the chest at 1 10 pm  according to Rodr guez  194  In all  Guevara was shot nine times  This included five times in the legs  once in the right shoulder and arm  once in the chest  and finally in the throat  189  Months earlier  during his last public declaration to the Tricontinental Conference  151  Guevara wrote his own epitaph  stating  Wherever death may surprise us  let it be welcome  provided that this our battle cry may have reached some receptive ear and another hand may be extended to wield our weapons   195  Post execution  remains and memorial The day after his execution on October 10  1967  Guevara s corpse was displayed to the world press in the laundry house of the Vallegrande hospital   photo by Freddy Alborta         Face     Side angle    Shoes Main article  Che Guevara Mausoleum After his execution  Guevara s body was lashed to the landing skids of a helicopter and flown to nearby Vallegrande  where photographs were taken of him lying on a concrete slab in the laundry room of the Nuestra Se ora de Malta  196  Several witnesses were called to confirm that it was Guevara  key amongst them British journalist Richard Gott  the only witness to have met Guevara when he was alive  Put on public show  as hundreds of local residents filed past the body  many of them considered Guevara s corpse to represent a  Christ like  visage  with some of them even surreptitiously clipping locks of his hair as divine relics  197  Such comparisons were further extended when two weeks later upon seeing the post mortem photographs  English art critic John Berger observed that they resembled two famous paintings  Rembrandt s The Anatomy Lesson of Dr  Nicolaes Tulp and Andrea Mantegna s Lamentation over the Dead Christ  198  There were also four correspondents present when Guevara s body arrived in Vallegrande  including Bjorn Kumm of the Swedish Aftonbladet  who described the scene in an November 11  1967  exclusive for The New Republic  199  A declassified memorandum dated October 11  1967 to United States President Lyndon B  Johnson from his National Security Advisor  Walt Whitman Rostow  called the decision to kill Guevara  stupid  but  understandable from a Bolivian standpoint   200  After the execution  Rodr guez took several of Guevara s personal items  including a Rolex GMT Master wristwatch 201  which he continued to wear many years later  often showing them to reporters during the ensuing years  202  Today  some of these belongings  including his flashlight  are on display at the CIA  203  After a military doctor amputated his hands  Bolivian army officers transferred Guevara s body to an undisclosed location and refused to reveal whether his remains had been buried or cremated  The hands were preserved in formaldehyde to be sent to Buenos Aires for fingerprint identification   His fingerprints were on file with the Argentine police   They were later sent to Cuba  Plaza de la Revoluci n  in Havana  Cuba  Aside the Ministry of the Interior building where Guevara once worked  is a 5 story steel outline of his face  Under the image is Guevara s motto  the Spanish phrase   Hasta la Victoria Siempre   English  Until the Eternal Victory   On October 15  Fidel Castro publicly acknowledged that Guevara was dead and proclaimed three days of public mourning throughout Cuba  204  On October 18  Castro addressed a crowd of one million mourners in Havana s Plaza de la Revoluci n and spoke about Guevara s character as a revolutionary  205  Fidel Castro closed his impassioned eulogy thusly   If we wish to express what we want the men of future generations to be  we must say  Let them be like Che  If we wish to say how we want our children to be educated  we must say without hesitation  We want them to be educated in Che s spirit  If we want the model of a man  who does not belong to our times but to the future  I say from the depths of my heart that such a model  without a single stain on his conduct  without a single stain on his action  is Che   206  French intellectual R gis Debray  who was captured in April 1967 while with Guevara in Bolivia  gave an interview from prison  in August 1968  where he enlarged on the circumstances of Guevara s capture  Debray  who had lived with Guevara s band of guerrillas for a short time  said that in his view they were  victims of the forest  and thus  eaten by the jungle   207  Debray described a destitute situation where Guevara s men suffered malnutrition  lack of water  absence of shoes  and only possessed six blankets for 22 men  Debray recounts that Guevara and the others had been suffering an  illness  which caused their hands and feet to swell into  mounds of flesh  to the point where you could not discern the fingers on their hands  207  Despite the futile situation  Debray described Guevara as  optimistic about the future of Latin America  and remarked that Guevara was  resigned to die in the knowledge that his death would be a sort of renaissance   noting that Guevara perceived death  as a promise of rebirth  and  ritual of renewal   207  In late 1995  retired Bolivian General Mario Vargas revealed to Jon Lee Anderson  author of Che Guevara  A Revolutionary Life  that Guevara s body was located near a Vallegrande airstrip  The result was a multi national search for the remains  which would last more than a year  In July 1997  a team of Cuban geologists and Argentine forensic anthropologists discovered the remnants of seven bodies in two mass graves  including one man with amputated hands  like Guevara   Bolivian government officials with the Ministry of Interior later identified the body as Guevara when the excavated teeth  perfectly matched  a plaster mold of Che s teeth  made in Cuba prior to his Congolese expedition  The  clincher  then arrived when Argentine forensic anthropologist Alejandro Inchaurregui inspected the inside hidden pocket of a blue jacket dug up next to the handless cadaver and found a small bag of pipe tobacco  Nino de Guzman  the Bolivian helicopter pilot who had given Che a small bag of tobacco  later remarked that he  had serious doubts  at first and  thought the Cubans would just find any old bones and call it Che   he stated  after hearing about the tobacco pouch  I have no doubts   188  On October 17  1997  Guevara s remains  with those of six of his fellow combatants  were laid to rest with military honors in a specially built mausoleum in the Cuban city of Santa Clara  where he had commanded over the decisive military victory of the Cuban Revolution  208  Che Guevara s Monument and Mausoleum in Santa Clara  Cuba  Removed when Guevara was captured were his 30 000 word  hand written diary  a collection of his personal poetry  and a short story he authored about a young Communist guerrilla who learns to overcome his fears  209  His diary documented events of the guerrilla campaign in Bolivia 210  with the first entry on November 7  1966 shortly after his arrival at the farm in  ancahuaz   and the last dated October 7  1967  the day before his capture  The diary tells how the guerrillas were forced to begin operations prematurely because of discovery by the Bolivian Army  explains Guevara s decision to divide the column into two units that were subsequently unable to re establish contact  and describes their overall unsuccessful venture  It also records the rift between Guevara and the Communist Party of Bolivia that resulted in Guevara having significantly fewer soldiers than originally expected and shows that Guevara had a great deal of difficulty recruiting from the local populace  partly because of the fact that the guerrilla group had learned Quechua  unaware that the local language was actually a Tup  Guaran  language  211  As the campaign drew to an unexpected close  Guevara became increasingly ill  He suffered from ever worsening bouts of asthma  and most of his last offensives were carried out in an attempt to obtain medicine  212  The Bolivian Diary was quickly and crudely translated by Ramparts magazine and circulated around the world  213  There are at least four additional diaries in existence those of Israel Reyes Zayas  Alias  Braulio    Harry Villegas Tamayo   Pombo    Eliseo Reyes Rodriguez   Rolando   174  and Dariel Alarc n Ram rez   Benigno   214  each of which reveals additional aspects of the events  In July 2008  the Bolivian government of Evo Morales unveiled Guevara s formerly sealed diaries composed in two frayed notebooks  along with a logbook and several black and white photographs  At this event  Bolivia s vice minister of culture  Pablo Groux  expressed that there were plans to publish photographs of every handwritten page later in the year  215  Meanwhile  in August 2009  anthropologists working for Bolivia s Justice Ministry discovered and unearthed five of Guevara s fellow guerrillas near the Bolivian town of Teoponte  216  Legacy Main articles  Legacy of Che Guevara and Che Guevara in popular culture  The discovery of Che s remains metonymically activated a series of interlinked associations   rebel  martyr  rogue figure from a picaresque adventure  savior  renegade  extremist   in which there was no fixed divide among them  The current court of opinion places Che on a continuum that teeters between viewing him as a misguided rebel  a coruscatingly brilliant guerrilla philosopher  a poet warrior jousting at windmills  a brazen warrior who threw down the gauntlet to the bourgeoisie  the object of fervent paeans to his sainthood  or a mass murderer clothed in the guise of an avenging angel whose every action is imbricated in violence   the archetypal Fanatical Terrorist     Dr  Peter McLaren  author of Che Guevara  Paulo Freire  and the Pedagogy of Revolution  217  A stylized graphic of Guevara s face on a flag above the words  El Che Vive   The Che Lives   Over forty years after his execution  Che s life and legacy still remain a contentious issue  The contradictions of his ethos at various points in his life have created a complex character of unending duality  An array of notable individuals have lauded Guevara as a hero  218  for example  Nelson Mandela referred to him as  an inspiration for every human being who loves freedom  183  while Jean Paul Sartre described him as  not only an intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age   219  Others who expressed their admiration include authors Graham Greene who remarked that Che  represented the idea of gallantry  chivalry  and adventure   220  and Susan Sontag who expounded that   Che s  goal was nothing less than the cause of humanity itself   221  In the black community  philosopher Frantz Fanon professed Guevara to be  the world symbol of the possibilities of one man   222  while Black Panther Party head Stokely Carmichael eulogized that  Che Guevara is not dead  his ideas are with us   223  Praise has been reflected throughout the political spectrum  with the libertarian theorist Murray Rothbard extolling Guevara as a  heroic figure   lamenting after his death that  more than any man of our epoch or even of our century   Che  was the living embodiment of the principle of revolution   224  while journalist Christopher Hitchens commented that   Che s  death meant a lot to me and countless like me at the time  he was a role model  albeit an impossible one for us bourgeois romantics insofar as he went and did what revolutionaries were meant to do fought and died for his beliefs   225  Guevara remains a beloved national hero to many in Cuba  where his image adorns the  3 Cuban Peso and school children begin each morning by pledging  We will be like Che   226  In his homeland of Argentina  where high schools bear his name  227  numerous Che museums dot the country  which in 2008 unveiled a 12 foot  3 7 m  bronze statue of him in his birth city of Rosario  228  Additionally  Guevara has been sanctified by some Bolivian campesinos 229  as  Saint Ernesto   to whom they pray for assistance  230  Conversely  Jacobo Machover  an exiled opposition author  dismisses the hero worshipping and portrays him as a ruthless executioner  231  Detractors have theorized that in much of Latin America  Che inspired revolutions had the practical result of reinforcing brutal militarism and internecine conflict for many years  232  In an assessment of Guevara  British historian Hugh Thomas opines that Che was a  brave  sincere and determined man who was also obstinate  narrow  and dogmatic   233  At the end of his life  according to Thomas   he seems to have become convinced of the virtues of violence for its own sake   while  his influence over Castro for good or evil  grew after his death  as Fidel took up many of his views  In Thomas  assessment  as in the case of Mart   or Lawrence of Arabia  failure has brightened  not dimmed the legend   233 Alvaro Vargas Llosa of The Independent Institute has hypothesized that Guevara s contemporary followers  delude themselves by clinging to a myth   while describing Guevara as  Marxist Puritan  who employed his rigid power to suppress dissent  while also operating as a  cold blooded killing machine   232  Llosa has also accused Guevara s  fanatical disposition  as being the linchpin of the  Sovietization  of the Cuban revolution  speculating that he possessed a  total subordination of reality to blind ideological orthodoxy   232  Guevara remains a hated figure amongst many in the Cuban exile and Cuban American community of the United States  who view him with animosity as  the butcher of La Caba a   234  Despite his polarized status  a high contrast monochrome graphic of his face  created in 1968 by Irish artist Jim Fitzpatrick  has become one of the world s most universally merchandized and objectified images  235  236  found on an endless array of items  including T shirts  hats  posters  tattoos  and bikinis  237  ironically contributing to the consumer culture Guevara despised  Yet  he still remains a transcendent figure both in specifically political contexts 238  and as a wide ranging popular icon of youthful rebellion  239  Timeline Che Guevara timeline Archival media Video footage Guevara interviewed in 1964 on a visit to Dublin

differing numbers of executions attributable to Guevara  with some of the discrepancy resulting from the question of which deaths to attribute directly to Guevara and which to the regime as a whole  Anderson  1997  gives the number specifically at La Caba a prison as 55  p  387    while also stating that  several hundred people were officially tried and executed across Cuba  as a whole  p  387    Casta eda 1998  notes that historians differ on the total number killed  with different studies placing it as anywhere from 200 to 700 nationwide  p  143   although he notes that  after a certain date most of the executions occurred outside of Che s jurisdiction   p  143   These numbers are supported by the opposition based Free Society Project   Cuba Archive  which gives the figure as 144 executions ordered by Guevara across Cuba in three years  1957 1959  and 105  victims  specifically at La Caba a  which according to them were all  carried out without due process of law   Of further note  much of the discrepancy in the estimates between 55 versus 105 executed at La Caba a revolves around whether to include instances where Guevara had denied an appeal and signed off on a death warrant  but where the sentence was carried out while he traveled overseas from June 4 to September 8  or after he relinquished his command of the fortress on June 12  1959    Anderson 1997  p  375
