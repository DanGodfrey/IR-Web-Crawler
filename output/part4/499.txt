See also 10 Notes 11 Related information Layout Main page  Wikipedia Layout Layout matters  Good articles start with introductions  continue with a clear structure  and end with standard appendices such as references and related articles  Structure of the article Introductory material Good articles start with a brief lead section introducing the topic  We discuss lead sections in greater detail below  The lead section should come above the first header  it is almost never useful to add something like   Introduction    Sometimes  the first section after the lead is a broad summary of the topic  and is called  Overview   although more specific section titles and structures are generally preferred  Paragraphs Paragraphs should be short enough to be readable  but long enough to develop an idea  Overly long paragraphs should be split up  as long as the cousin paragraphs keep the idea in focus  One sentence paragraphs are unusually emphatic  and should be used sparingly  Articles should rarely  if ever  consist solely of such paragraphs  Some paragraphs are really tables or lists in disguise  They should be rewritten as prose or converted to unmasked form  Wikipedia When to use tables and Wikipedia Embedded list offer guidance on the proper use of these elements  Headings Headings help clarify articles and create a structure shown in the table of contents  To learn about how the MediaWiki software uses sections  see Help Section  Headings are hierarchical  The article s title uses a level 1 heading  so you should start with level 2 heading    Heading    and follow it with lower levels     Subheading         Subsubheading      and so forth  Whether extensive subtopics should be kept on one page or moved to individual pages is a matter of personal judgment  See also below under  Summary style  Headings should not be Wikilinked  This is because headings in themselves introduce information and let the reader know what subtopics will be presented  Wikilinks should be incorporated in the text of the section  Images If the article can be illustrated with pictures  find an appropriate place to position these images  where they relate closely to text they illustrate  If there might be doubt  draw attention to the image in the text  illustration right   For more information on using pictures  see Wikipedia Layout Images and Wikipedia Picture tutorial  Standard appendices As explained in more detail at Wikipedia Layout Standard appendices and footers  optional appendix sections containing the following information may appear after the body of the article in the following order  A list of books or other works created by the subject of the article  works   A list of internal  wikilinks  to related Wikipedia articles  see also   Notes and references  notes  footnotes  or references   A list of recommended relevant books  articles  or other publications that have not been used as sources  further reading   and A list of recommended relevant websites that have not been used as sources  external links   With some exceptions  any links to other Wikimedia projects appear in further reading or external links sections  Succession boxes and navigational footers go at the end of the article  following the last appendix section  but preceding the category and interwiki templates  Size Shortcut  WP BETTER SIZE See also  Wikipedia Article size Articles should be kept relatively short  Say what needs saying  but do not overdo it  Articles should aim to be less than 30KB worth of prose  When articles grow past this amount of readable text  they can be broken up into smaller articles to improve readability and ease of editing  The headed sub section should be retained  with a concise version of what has been removed under an italicized header  such as Main article  History of Ruritania  a list of templates used to create these headers is available at Category Wikipedia page section templates   Otherwise  context is lost and the general treatment suffers  Each article on a subtopic should be written as a stand alone article that is  it should have a lead section  headings  et cetera  When an article is long and has many sub articles  try to balance the main page  Do not put undue weight into one part of an article at the cost of other parts  In shorter articles  if one subtopic has much more text than another subtopic  that may be an indication the subtopic should have its own page  with only a summary presented on the main page  Articles covering subtopics Wikipedia articles tend to grow in a way that leads to the natural creation of new articles  The text of any article consists of a sequence of related but distinct subtopics  When there is enough text in a given subtopic to merit its own article  that text can be summarized in the present article and a link provided to the more detailed article  Cricket is an example of an article covering subtopics  it is divided into subsections that give an overview of the sport  with each subsection leading to one or more subtopic articles  Information style and tone Two styles  closely related  tend to be used for Wikipedia articles  The tone  however  should always remain formal  impersonal  and dispassionate  News style Some Wikipedians prefer using a news style  News style is the prose style of short  direct front page newspaper stories and the news bulletins that air on radio and television  The main feature of news style is a placement of important information first  with a decreasing importance as the article advances  Originally developed so that the editors could cut from the bottom to fit an item in the available layout space  it prioritizes information  because many people expect to find important material early  and less important information later where interest decreases  Encyclopedia articles are not required to be in news style  but a familiarity with this convention may help in planning the style and layout of an article  Summary style Main page  Wikipedia Summary style Summary style is an organizational style that is similar to news style except that it applies to topics instead of articles and mostly lead sections instead of lead sentences  The idea is to distribute information in such a way that Wikipedia can serve readers who want varying amounts of detail  It is up to the reader to choose how much detail they are exposed to  Using progressively longer and longer summaries avoids overwhelming the reader with too much text at once  This is the style followed by such featured articles as Cricket and Music of the Lesser Antilles  There are two main reasons for using Summary style in Wikipedia articles  One is that different readers desire different levels of detail  some readers need just a quick summary and are satisfied by the lead section  more people need a moderate amount of info  and will find the article suitable to their needs  yet others need a lot of detail  and will be interested in reading the sub articles  The other reason is simply that an article that is too long becomes tedious to read  and might repeat itself or represent writing that could be more concise  Tone Shortcut  WP TONE Wikipedia articles  and other encyclopedic content  should be written in a formal tone  Standards for formal tone vary depending upon the subject matter  but should follow the style used by reliable sources  while remaining clear and understandable  Formal tone means that the article should not be written using unintelligible argot  slang  colloquialisms  doublespeak  legalese  or jargon  it means that the English language should be used in a businesslike manner  Articles should generally not be written from a first or second person perspective  In prose writing  the first person   I  and  we   point of view and second person   you  and  your   point of view typically evoke a strong narrator  While this is acceptable in works of fiction  it is generally unsuitable in an encyclopedia  where the writer should be invisible to the reader  Moreover  pertaining specifically to Wikipedia s policies  the first person often inappropriately implies a point of view inconsistent with WP NPOV  and second person is inappropriately associated with step by step instructions of a how to guide  see WP NOTHOWTO   First and second person pronouns should ordinarily be used only in attributed direct quotations relevant to the subject of the article  As with many such guidelines  however  there are exceptions  for instance  in professional mathematics writing  use of the first person plural   we   as  inclusive we  is widespread  Use common sense to determine if the chosen perspective is in the spirit of this guideline  Gender neutral pronouns should be used where the gender is not specific  see Gender neutral language for further information  Punctuation marks that appear in the article should be used only per generally accepted practice  Exclamation marks     should be used only if they occur in direct quotations  Provide context for the reader Shortcuts  WP PCR WP AUDIENCE For context and linking  see Wikipedia Manual of Style  links   Wikipedia is an international encyclopedia  People who read Wikipedia have different backgrounds  education and opinions  Make your article accessible and understandable for as many readers as possible  Assume readers are reading the article to learn  It is possible that the reader knows nothing about the subject  the article needs to explain the subject fully  Avoid using jargon whenever possible  Consider the reader  An article entitled  Use of chromatic scales in early Baroque music  is likely to be read by musicians  and technical details and terms are appropriate  linking to articles explaining the technical terms  An article entitled  Baroque music  is likely to be read by laypersons who want a brief and plainly written overview  with links to available detailed information  When jargon is used in an article  a brief explanation should be given within the article  Aim for a balance between comprehensibility and detail so that readers can gain information from the article  Evaluating context Here are some thought experiments to help you test whether you are setting enough context  Does the article make sense if the reader gets to it as a random page   Special Random  Imagine yourself as a layperson in another English speaking country  Can you figure out what the article is about  Can people tell what the article is about if the first page is printed out and passed around  Would a reader want to follow some of the links  Build the web Main page  Wikipedia Manual of Style  linking  Remember that every Wikipedia article is tightly connected to a network of other topics  Establishing such connections via wikilink is a good way to establish context  Because Wikipedia is not a long  ordered sequence of carefully categorized articles like a paper encyclopedia  but a collection of randomly accessible  highly interlinked ones  each article should contain links to more general subjects that serve to categorize the article  When creating links  do not go overboard  and be careful to make your links relevant  It is not necessary to link the same term twelve times  although if it appears in the lead  then near the end  it might be a good idea to link it twice   Avoid making your articles orphans  When you write a new article  make sure that one or more other pages link to it  to lessen the chances that your article will be orphaned through someone else s refactoring  Otherwise  when it falls off the bottom of the Recent Changes page  it will disappear into the Mists of Avalon  There should always be an unbroken chain of links leading from the Main Page to every article in Wikipedia  following the path you would expect to use to find your article may give you some hints as to which articles should link to your article  State the obvious Shortcut  WP OBVIOUS State facts that may be obvious to you  but are not necessarily obvious to the reader  Usually  such a statement will be in the first sentence or two of the article  For example  consider this sentence  The Ford Thunderbird was conceived as a response to the Chevrolet Corvette and entered production for the 1955 model year  Here no mention is made of the Ford Thunderbird s fundamental nature  it is an automobile  It assumes that the reader already knows this an assumption that may not be correct  especially if the reader is not familiar with Ford or Chevrolet  Perhaps instead  The Ford Thunderbird is a car manufactured in the United States by the Ford Motor Company  However  there is no need to go overboard  There is no need to explain a common word like  car   Repetition is usually unnecessary  for example  Shoichi Yokoi was conscripted into the Imperial Japanese Army in 1941  conveys enough information  although it is not a good first sentence   However  the following is verbose  Shoichi Yokoi was a Japanese soldier in Japan who was drafted into the Imperial Japanese Army in 1941  Lead section As explained in more detail at Wikipedia Lead section Introductory text  all but the shortest articles should start with introductory text  the  lead    The lead should establish significance  include mention of notable criticism or controversies  and be written in a way that makes readers want to know more  The appropriate length of the lead depends on that of the article  but should normally be no more than four paragraphs  The lead itself has no heading and  on pages with more than three headings  automatically appears above the table of contents  if present  Opening paragraph Normally  the opening paragraph summarizes the most important points of the article  It should clearly explain the subject so that the reader is prepared for the greater level of detail that follows  If further introductory material is appropriate before the first section  it can be covered in subsequent paragraphs in the lead  Introductions to biographical articles commonly double as summaries  listing the best known achievements of the subject  Because some readers will read only the opening of an article  the most vital information should be included  First sentence content The article should begin with a short declarative sentence  answering two questions for the nonspecialist reader   What  or who  is the subject   and  Why is this subject notable   1  If possible  the page title should be the subject of the first sentence  2  However  if the article title is merely descriptive such as Electrical characteristics of a dynamic loudspeaker the title does not need to appear verbatim in the main text  Similarly  where an article title is of the type  List of       a clearer and more informative introduction to the list is better than verbatim repetition of the title  When the page title is used as the subject of the first sentence  it may appear in a slightly different form  and it may include variations  3  Similarly  if the title has a parenthetical disambiguator  the disambiguator should be omitted in the text  4  If its subject is amenable to definition  then the first sentence should give a concise definition  where possible  one that puts the article in context for the nonspecialist  Similarly  if the subject is a term of art  provide the context as early as possible  5  If the article is about a fictional character or place  make sure to say so  6  First sentence format As a general rule  the first  and only the first  appearance of the page title should be in boldface as early as possible in the first sentence  An electron is a subatomic particle that carries a negative electric charge  However  if the title of a page is descriptive and does not appear verbatim in the main text  then it should not be in boldface  So  for example  Electrical characteristics of dynamic loudspeakers begins with  The chief electrical characteristic of a dynamic loudspeaker s driver is its electrical impedance as a function of frequency  If the subject of the page is normally italicized  for example  a work of art  literature  album  or ship  then its first mention should be both bold and italic text  if it is usually surrounded by quotation marks  the title should be bold but the quotation marks should not  Las Meninas  Spanish for The Maids of Honour  is a 1656 painting by Diego Vel zquez       Yesterday  is a pop song originally recorded by The Beatles for their 1965 album Help   If the subject of the page has a common abbreviation or more than one name  the abbreviation  in parentheses  and each additional name should be in boldface on its first appearance  Sodium hydroxide  NaOH   also known as lye  caustic soda and  incorrectly  according to IUPAC nomenclature  sodium hydrate  is     Use as few links as possible before and in the bolded title  Thereafter  words used in a title may be linked to provide more detail  Arugam Bay is a bay situated on the Indian Ocean in the dry zone of Sri Lanka s southeast coast  The rest of the opening paragraph Then proceed with a description  Remember  the basic significance of a topic may not be obvious to nonspecialist readers  even if they understand the basic characterization or definition  Tell them  For instance  Peer review  known as refereeing in some academic fields  is a scholarly process used in the publication of manuscripts and in the awarding of money for research  Publishers and agencies use peer review to select and to screen submissions  At the same time  the process assists authors in meeting the standards of their discipline  Publications and awards that have not undergone peer review are liable to be regarded with suspicion by scholars and professionals in many fields  The rest of the lead section If the article is long enough for the lead section to contain several paragraphs  then the first paragraph should be short and to the point  with a clear explanation of what the subject of the page is  The following paragraphs should give a summary of the article  They should provide an overview of the main points the article will make  summarizing the primary reasons the subject matter is interesting or notable  including its more important controversies  if there are any  The appropriate length of the lead section depends on the total length of the article  As a general guideline  the lead should be no longer than two or three paragraphs  The following specific rules have been proposed  Article Length Lead Length Fewer than 15 000 characters One or two paragraphs 15 000 30 000 characters Two or three paragraphs More than 30 000 characters Three or four paragraphs Use other languages sparingly Main page  Wikipedia Manual of Style Foreign terms It is fine to include foreign terms as extra information  but avoid writing articles that can only be understood if the reader understands the foreign terms  Such words are equivalent to jargon  which should be explained somehow  In the English language Wikipedia  the English form does not always have to come first  sometimes the non English word is better as the main text  with the English in parentheses or set off by commas after it  and sometimes not  For example  see perestroika  Non English words in the English language Wikipedia should be written in italics  Non English words should be used as titles for entries only as a last resort  Again  see perestroika  English title terms taken from a language that does not use the Roman alphabet can include the native spelling in parentheses  See  for example  I Ching  simplified Chinese      traditional Chinese      pinyin  y  j ng  or Sophocles  Greek             The native spelling is useful for precisely identifying foreign words  since transliterations may be inaccurate or ambiguous  Foreign terms within the article body do not need native spellings if they can be specified as title terms in separate articles  Use color sparingly See also  Help Using colours If possible  avoid presenting information with color only within the article s text and in tables  Color should only be used sparingly  as a secondary visual aid  Computers and browsers vary  and you cannot know how much color  if any  is visible on the recipient s machine  Wikipedia is international  colors have different meaning in different cultures  Too many colors on one page look cluttered and unencyclopedic  Specifically  use the color red only for alerts and warnings  Awareness of color should be allowed for low vision viewers  poor lighting  color blindness  dark or overbright screens  and the wrong contrast color settings on the display screen  Use clear  precise and accurate terms Shortcut  WP ATE Be concise Shortcuts  WP TRITE WP TERSE Articles should use only necessary words  This does not mean using fewer words is always better  rather  when considering equivalent expressions  choose the more concise  Consider the view of William Strunk  Jr  from the 1918 work  The Elements of Style  Vigorous writing is concise  A sentence should contain no unnecessary words  a paragraph no unnecessary sentences  for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts  This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short  or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline  but that every word tell  Reduce sentences to the essentials  Wordiness does not add credibility to Wikipedia articles  Avoid temporary expressions like  due to the fact that  in place of  because   or  at the present time  for  currently   The ideal method of specifying on going events is  as of 2012   Wikipedia  grammar bots  will replace these types of expressions with correct wording  Conciseness does not justify removing information from an article  The use of subjective qualifiers should be avoided  Principle of least astonishment Shortcuts  WP ASTONISH WP SURPRISE When the principle of least astonishment is successfully employed  information is understood by the reader without struggle  The average reader should not be shocked  surprised  or overwhelmingly confused by your article  For example  do not write   Most people in Fargo  N D  are dead  That is  dead tired by the end of a long work day   You should not use provocative language in descriptions or arguments  Instead  offer information gently  Use consistent vocabulary in parts that are technical and difficult  To work out which parts of the sentence are going to be difficult for the reader  try to put yourself in the position of a reader hitherto uninformed on the subject  You should plan your page structure and links so that everything appears reasonable and makes sense  If a link takes readers to somewhere other than where they thought it would  it should at least take them somewhere that makes sense  Similarly  make sure that concepts being used as the basis for further discussion have already been defined or linked to a proper article  Explain causes before consequences and make sure your logical sequence is clear and sound  especially to the layman  Ensure that redirects and hatnotes that are likely to be useful are in place  If a user wants to know about the branch of a well known international hotel chain in the French capital  she may type  Paris Hilton  into the search box  This will  of course  take her to the page associated with a well known socialite  Luckily  though  a hatnote at the top of that article exists in order to point our user to an article which she will find more useful  Use of  refers to  Shortcuts  WP REFERS WP UMD Phrases such as refers to  is the name of  or is a term for are sometimes found in the introduction to a Wikipedia article  For example  the article Computer architecture once began with the sentence   Computer architecture refers to the theory behind the design of a computer   That is not literally true  computer architecture is the theory  The words themselves refer to the theory  but the article is not about those words  it is about the theory itself  Thus it is more correct to say   Computer architecture is the theory behind the design of a computer   This is known as the use mention distinction  For the vast majority of articles  the introduction is using a term   Computer architecture is a theory    rather than mentioning it   All your base are belong to us is a broken English phrase    Disambiguation articles mention the term  so it is correct to write  e g    The term Great Schism refers to either one of two schisms in the history of Christianity        but a content article should read  There have been two Great Schisms in the history of Christianity   When referring directly to a term rather than using it  write the word in italics  as shown above  see WP WORDSASWORDS  Check your facts See also  Wikipedia Verifiability Write material that is true  check your facts  Do not write material that is false  This might require that you verify your alleged facts  This is a crucial part of citing good sources  even if you think you know something  you have to provide references anyway to prove to the reader that the fact is true  Material that seems to naturally stem from sourced claims might not have been actually claimed  In searching for good references to cite  you might even learn something new  Be careful about deleting material that may be factual  If you are inclined to delete something from an entry  first consider checking whether it is true  If material apparently is factual  in other words substantiated and cited  be extra careful about deleting  An encyclopedia is a collection of facts  If another editor provided a fact  there was probably a reason for it that should not be overlooked  Therefore  consider each fact provided as potentially precious  Is the context or overall presentation the issue  If the fact does not belong in one particular article  maybe it belongs in another  Examine entries you have worked on subsequent to revision by others  Have facts been omitted or deleted  It may be the case that you failed to provide sufficient substantiation for the facts  or that the facts you incorporated may need a clearer relationship to the entry  Protect your facts  but also be sure that they are presented meaningfully  Check your fiction  WP CYF  redirects here  For the Wikipedia essay  see Wikipedia Check your facts  Main page  Wikipedia Manual of Style  writing about fiction  The advice about factual articles also applies to articles on fiction subjects  Further considerations apply when writing about fictional topics because they are inherently not real  It is important to keep these articles verifiable and encyclopedic  If you add fictional information  clearly distinguish fact and fiction  As with normal articles  establish context so that a reader unfamiliar with the subject can get an idea about the article s meaning without having to check several links  Instead of writing  Trillian is Arthur Dent s girlfriend  She was taken away from Earth by Zaphod when he met her at a party  She meets Dent while travelling with Zaphod   write  Trillian is a fictional character from Douglas Adams s radio  book and now film series The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  In the first book  Trillian is introduced to the main character Arthur Dent on a spaceship  In her backstory  she was taken away from Earth when the space alien Zaphod Beeblebrox met her at a party   And so forth  Shortcut  WP TENSE Works of fiction are generally considered to  come alive  when read  They exist in a kind of perpetual present tense  regardless of when the fictional action is supposed to take place relative to  now   Thus  generally you should write about fiction using the present tense  not the past tense   Homer presents  Achilles rages  Andromache laments  Priam pleads    Darth Vader is a fictional character from Star Wars    Holden Caulfield has a certain disdain for what he sees as  phony     Heathcliff  who is taken in by the wealthy Earnshaw family as a child  falls in love with their daughter  Catherine   Friends is an American sitcom that was aired on NBC  Conversely  discussion of history is usually written in the past tense and thus  fictional history  may be presented in that way as well   Chroniclers claimed that Thalestris  queen of the Amazons  seduced Alexander the Great   Articles about fictional topics should not read like book reports  instead  they should explain the topic s significance to the work  After reading the article  the reader should be able to understand why a character  place  or event was included in the fictional work  It is generally discouraged to add fictional information from sources that cannot be verified or are limited to a very small number of readers  such as fan fiction and online role playing games  In the latter case  if you absolutely have to write about the subject  please be especially careful to cite your sources  If the subject  say a character in a television show  is too limited to be given a full article  then integrate information about that character into a larger article  It is better to write a larger article about the television show or a fictional universe itself than to create all sorts of stubs about its characters that nobody can find  Stay on topic Shortcuts  WP TOPIC WP OFFTOPIC The most readable articles contain no irrelevant  nor only loosely relevant  information  While writing an article  you might find yourself digressing into a side subject  If you find yourself wandering off topic  consider placing the additional information into a different article  where it will fit more closely with the topic  If you provide a link to the other article  readers who are interested in the side topic have the option of digging into it  but readers who are not interested will not be distracted by it  Due to the way in which Wikipedia has grown  many articles contain such redundant texts  Please be bold in deleting them  Pay attention to spelling Main page  Wikipedia Spellchecking Pay attention to spelling  particularly of new page names  Articles with good spelling and proper grammar will encourage further contributions of good content  Proper spelling of an article name will also make it easier for other authors to link their articles to your article  Sloppiness in one aspect of writing leads to sloppiness in others  Always do your best  It is not that big a deal  but why not have it right  Use free Internet dictionaries like Ask Oxford  Dictionary com  Google Define and a spell checker such as SpellOnline com or SpellCheck net  See Wikipedia Typo Team for tips on how to use these resources  Articles may also be spell checked in a word processor before being saved  A free word processor may be obtained from OpenOffice org  Some browsers  such as Mozilla Firefox  Konqueror  Safari or Opera  have the ability to highlight misspelled words in text boxes  Avoid peacock and weasel terms Avoid peacock terms that show off the subject of the article without containing any real information  Similarly  avoid weasel words that offer an opinion without really backing it up  and which are really used to express a non neutral point of view  Examples of peacock terms an important    one of the most prestigious    one of the best    the most influential    a significant    the great    Examples of weasel words Some people say       is widely regarded as      is widely considered       has been called    It is believed that    It has been suggested noticed decided    Some people believe    It has been said that    Some would say    Legend has it that    Critics say that    Many some have claimed    Believe in your subject  Let the facts speak for themselves  If your ice hockey player  canton  or species of beetle is worth the reader s time  it will come out through the facts  However  in some cases  for example  history of graphic design  using superlative adjectives  in the      one of the most important figures in the history of      format  in the description may help readers with no previous knowledge about the subject to acknowledge the importance or generally perceived status of the subject discussed  Note that to use this type of superlative adjective format  the most reputable experts in the respective field must support the claim  Avoid blanket terms unless you have verified them  For example  this article states that of the 18 Montgomery Counties in the United States  most are named after Richard Montgomery  This is a blanket statement  It may very well be true  but is it reliable  In this instance  the editor had done the research to verify this  Without the research  the statement should not be made  It is always a good idea to describe the research done and sign it on the article s talk page  If you wish to  or must refer to an opinion  first make sure someone who holds some standing in that subject gives it  A view on former American President Gerald Ford from Henry Kissinger is more interesting for the reader than one from your teacher from school  Then say who holds the opinion being given  preferably with a source or a quote for it  Compare the following  Some critics of George W  Bush have said he has low intelligence  Author Michael Moore in his book Stupid White Men    and Other Sorry Excuses for the State of the Nation  wrote an open letter to George Bush  In it  he asked   George  are you able to read and write on an adult level   Examples Sometimes the way around using these terms is to replace the statements with the facts that backs it up   The Yankees are one of the greatest baseball teams in history    The New York Yankees have won 26 World Series championships almost three times as many as any other team   By sticking to concrete and factual information  we can avoid the need to give any opinion at all  Doing so also makes for writing that is much more interesting  for example  William Peckenridge  eighth Duke of Omnium  1642    May 8  1691  is widely considered to be one of the most important men to carry that title  William Peckenridge  eighth Duke of Omnium  1642    May 8  1691  was personal counselor to King James I  general in the Wars of the Roses  a chemist  bandleader  and the director of the secret society known as The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  He expanded the title of Omnium to include protectorship of Guiana and right of revocation for civil service appointments in India  Show  don t tell  The first example simply tells the reader that William Peckenridge was important  The second example shows the reader why he was important  Exceptions When repeating established views  it may be easier to simply state   Before Nicolaus Copernicus  most people thought the sun revolved round the earth   rather than sacrifice clarity with details and sources  particularly if the statement forms only a small part of your article  However  in general  everything should be sourced  whether within the text  with a footnote  or with a general reference  Make omissions explicit for other editors Make omissions explicit when creating or editing an article  When writing an article  always aim for completeness  If for some reason you cannot cover a point that should be explained  make that omission explicit  You can do this either by leaving a note on the discussion page or by leaving HTML comments within the text and adding a notice to the bottom about the omissions  This has two purposes  it entices others to contribute  and it alerts non experts that the article they are reading does not yet give the full story  That s why Wikipedia is a collaborative encyclopedia we work together to achieve what we could not achieve individually  Every aspect that you cover means less work for someone else  plus you may cover something that someone else may not think of but which is nevertheless important to the subject  Add   todo   to the top of the talk page of articles for which you can establish some goals  priorities or things to do  Other issues Honorifics  Do not use honorifics or titles  such as Mr  Ms  Rev  Doctor  etc  See Wikipedia Naming conventions  names and titles  and Wikipedia Manual of Style  biographies  Inappropriate subjects  If you are trying to dress up something that doesn t belong in Wikipedia your band  your Web site  your company s product think twice about it  Wikipedia is not an advertising medium or home page service  Wikipedians are pretty clever  and if an article is really just personal gratification or blatant advertising  it s not going to last long no matter how  important  you say the subject is  Integrate changes When you make a change to some text  rather than appending the new text you would like to see included at the bottom of the page  if you feel so motivated  please place and edit your comments so that they flow seamlessly with the present text  Wikipedia articles should not end up being a series of disjointed comments about a subject  but unified  seamless  and ever expanding expositions of the subject  Avoiding common mistakes  It is easy to commit a Wikipedia faux pas  That is OK everybody does it  Nevertheless  here are a few you might try to avoid  Make a personal copy  Suppose you get into an edit war  Or worse  a revert war  Therefore  you try to stay cool  This is good  Congratulations  However  what would be great is if you could carry on working on the article  even though there is an edit war going on  and even though the version on the top is the evil one favoured by the other side in the dispute  So make a personal copy as a subpage of your user page  Just Start a new page at User MY NAME ARTICLE NAME  and copy and paste the wiki source in there  Then you can carry on improving the article at your own pace  If you like  drop a note on the appropriate talk page to let people know what you are doing  Some time later  at your leisure  once the fuss has died down  merge your improvements back in to the article proper  Maybe the other person has left Wikipedia  finding it not to their taste  Maybe they have gone on to other projects  Maybe they have changed their mind  Maybe someone else has made similar edits anyway  although they may not be as good as yours  as you have had more time to consider the matter   See also Wikipedia Basic copyediting Notes   For example  Amalie Emmy Noether   n  t    23 March 1882   14 April 1935  was a German mathematician known for her groundbreaking contributions to abstract algebra and her contributions to theoretical physics  This example not only tells the reader that the subject was a mathematician  it also indicates her field of expertise and work she did outside of it  The years of her birth and death provide time context  The reader who goes no further in this article already knows when she lived  what work she did  and why she is notable   Wikipedia Manual of Style  biographies  has more on the specific format for biography articles     For example  This Manual of Style is a style guide containing     not This style guide  known as the Manual of Style  contains       For example  in the article  United Kingdom   The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland  commonly known as the United Kingdom  the UK  or Britain  is a sovereign island country located off the northwestern coast of continental Europe    Thus  the article Egg  food  should start like this  An egg is an ovum produced by     Not like this  An egg  food  is an ovum produced by       For example  instead of  A trusted third party is an entity that facilitates interactions between two parties who both trust the third party  write  In cryptography  a trusted third party is an entity that facilitates interactions between two parties who both trust the third party    For example  Homer Simpson is a fictional character in The Simpsons  Related information v
