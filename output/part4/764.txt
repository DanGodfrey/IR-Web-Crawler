United States and incorporated in New Jersey  3  It was founded by George Eastman in 1889  Kodak is best known for its wide range of photographic film products  During most of the 20th century Kodak held a dominant position in photographic film  and in 1976 had a 90  market share of photographic film sales in the United States  The company s ubiquity was such that its tagline  Kodak moment  entered common lexicon as a personal event that demanded to be recorded for posterity  4  Beginning in the late 1990s  Kodak struggled financially as a result of the decline in sales of photographic film and its slowness in making the transition to digital photography  despite inventing the core technology used in current digital cameras as early as 1975 76   and 2007 was the most recent year in which the company made a profit  5  As part of its turnaround strategy  Kodak focused on digital photography and digital printing and attempted to generate revenues through aggressive patent litigation  6  7  On January 19  2012  Kodak filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and obtained a  950 million  18 month credit facility from Citigroup to enable it to continue trading  8  9  10  On February 9  2012 Kodak said that it will stop making digital cameras  pocket video cameras and digital picture frames in the first half of 2012  Kodak will focus on photo printing  through retail and online services as well as desktop inkjet devices and will instead license its brand name to other camera manufacturers  11  Contents 1 Name 2 History 2 1 Rivalry with Fujifilm 2 2 Shift to

saying   it seems a strong  incisive sort of letter    12  He and his mother devised the name Kodak with an Anagrams set  Eastman said that there were three principal concepts he used in creating the name  it should be short  one cannot mispronounce it  and it could not resemble anything or be associated with anything but Kodak  13  It has also been suggested that  Kodak  originated from the suggestion of David Houston  a fellow photographic inventor who held the patents to several roll film camera concepts that he later sold to Eastman  13  Houston  who started receiving patents in 1881  was said to have chosen  Nodak  as a nickname of his home state  North Dakota  NoDak   14  15  This is contested by other historians  however  who cite that Kodak was trademarked prior to Eastman buying Houston s patents  16   edit  History The Kodak factory and main office in Rochester  circa 1910  From the company s founding by George Eastman in 1889  Kodak followed the razor and blades strategy of selling inexpensive cameras and making large margins from consumables   film  chemicals and paper  As late as 1976  Kodak commanded 90  of film sales and 85  of camera sales in the U S   according to a 2005 case study for Harvard Business School  This seemingly unassailable competitive position would foster an unimaginative and complacent corporate culture   edit  Rivalry with Fujifilm Japanese competitor Fujifilm entered the U S  market  via Fuji Photo Film U S A   with lower priced film and supplies  but Kodak refused to believe that American consumers would ever desert its sacred brand  Kodak passed on the opportunity to become the official film of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics  Fuji won these sponsorship rights that gave them a permanent foothold in the marketplace  Fuji opened up a film plant in the U S  and its aggressive marketing and price cutting began taking market share from Kodak  Fuji went from a 10  share in the early 1990s and from 1993 1997 that grew to 17   Meanwhile  Kodak made little headway in Japan  the second largest market for photo film and paper after the United States  In May 1995  Kodak filed a petition with the US Commerce Department under section 301 of the Commerce Act arguing that its poor performance in the Japanese market was a direct result of unfair practices adopted by Fuji  The complaint was lodged by the United States with the World Trade Organization  17  On January 30  1998  the WTO announced a  sweeping rejection of Kodak s complaints  about the film market in Japan  Kodak s financial results for the year ending December 1997 showed that company s revenues dropped from  15 97 billion in 1996 to  14 36 billion in 1997  a fall of more than 10   their net earnings went from  1 29 billion to just  5 million for the same period  Kodak s market share plunged from 80 1  to 74 7  in the United States  a one year drop of five percentage points that had observers suggesting that Kodak was slow to react to changes and underestimated its rivals  18  19  20  20   edit  Shift to digital The Kodak logo from 1987 to 2006  21  This image is under review in WP Non free content review  Although Kodak developed a digital camera in 1975  the first of its kind  the product was dropped for fear it would threaten Kodak s photographic film business  22  23  In the 1990s  Kodak planned a decade long journey to move to digital technology  CEO George M  C  Fisher reached out to Microsoft and other new consumer merchandisers  Apple s pioneering QuickTake consumer digital cameras  introduced in 1994  had the Apple label but were produced by Kodak  Overall  though  there was little implementation of the new digital strategy  Kodak s core business faced no pressure from competing technologies  and as Kodak executives could not fathom a world without traditional film there was little incentive to deviate from that course  Consumers gradually switched to the digital offering from companies such as Sony  In 2001 film sales dropped  which was attributed by Kodak to the financial shocks preceding the September 11 attacks  Executives hoped that Kodak might be able to slow the shift to digital through aggressive marketing  24  Under Fisher s successor as CEO  Daniel Carp  Kodak made its move in the digital camera market  with its EasyShare family of digital cameras  Kodak spent tremendous resources studying customer behavior  finding out that women in particular loved taking digital photos but were frustrated in moving them to their computers  This key unmet consumer need became a major opportunity  Once Kodak got its product development machine started  it released model after model offering consumers top quality cameras at reasonable prices that made it easy to share photos with friends and family members via their PCs  One of their key innovations was a printer dock  where consumers could insert their cameras into this compact device  press a button  and watch their photos roll out  By 2005  Kodak ranked No  1 in the U S  in digital camera sales that surged 40  to  5 7 billion  24  Despite high growth  Kodak failed to anticipate how fast these digital cameras became commodities  with low profit margins  as more companies entered the market in the mid 2000s  25  In 2001 Kodak held the No  2 spot in U S  digital camera sales  behind Sony  but it lost  60 USD on every camera sold  while there was also a dispute between employees from its digital and film divisions  26  The film business  where Kodak enjoyed high profit margins  fell 18  in 2005  The combination of these two factors resulted in disappointing profits overall  24  Its digital cameras soon became undercut by Asian competitors that could produce their offerings more cheaply  Kodak had a 27 percent market leading share in 1999  that dwindled to 15 percent by 2003  26  In 2007 Kodak was No  4 in U S  digital camera sales with a 9 6 percent share  and by 2010 it held 7 percent in seventh place behind Canon  Sony  Nikon and others  according to research firm IDC  27  Also an ever smaller percentage of digital pictures were being taken on dedicated digital cameras  being gradually displaced in the late 2000s by cameras on cellphones  smartphones  and tablets   edit  New strategy Kodak headquarters in Rochester  New York  United States Kodak then began a strategy shift  Previously Kodak did everything in house  but CEO Antonio Perez shut down film factories and eliminated 27 000 jobs as it outsourced its manufacturing  28  Perez invested heavily in digital technologies and new services that capitalized on its technology innovation to boost profit margins  24  He also spent hundreds of millions of dollars to build up a high margin printer ink business to replace shriveling film sales  Kodak s ink strategy rejects the razor and blades business model used by the dominant market leader Hewlett Packard in that Kodak s printers are expensive but the ink is cheaper  29  As of 2011  these new lines of inkjet printers are said to be on verge of turning a profit  although some analysts are skeptical as printouts have been replaced gradually by electronic copies on computers  tablets  and smartphones  29  Home photo printers  high speed commercial inkjet presses  workflow software and packaging are viewed as the company s new core businesses  with sales from those four businesses projected to double to nearly  2 billion in revenue in 2013 and account for 25 percent of all sales  Kodak has also turned to aggressive patent litigation in order to generate revenue  6  7  In 2010  it received  838 million from patent licensing that included a settlement with LG  18  In 2011  despite the turnaround progress  Kodak rapidly used up its cash reserves  stoking fears of bankruptcy  it had  957 million in cash in June 2011  down from  1 6 billion in January 2001  30  In 2011  Kodak reportedly explored selling off or licensing its vast portfolio of patents in order to stave off bankruptcy  30  By January 2012  analysts suggested that the company could enter bankruptcy followed by an auction of its patents  as it was reported to be in talks with Citigroup to provide debtor in possession financing  9  31  This was confirmed on January 19  2012  when the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and obtained a  950 million  18 month credit facility from Citigroup to enable it to continue operations  8  9  10  Under the terms of its bankruptcy protection  Kodak currently has a deadline of February 15  2013 to produce a reorganization plan  32   edit  Timeline  edit  1880 to 1900 One Kodak Camera  complete with original box  camera  case  felt lens plug  manual  memorandum  amp  viewfinder card  An advertisement from The Photographic Herald and Amateur Sportsman  November 1889   April 1880  George Eastman leased the third floor of a building on State Street in Rochester and began the commercial manufacture of dry plates  January 1  1881  Eastman and businessman Henry A  Strong formed a partnership called the Eastman Dry Plate Company  33  Eastman resigned his position at the Rochester Savings Bank in order to work full time at the Eastman Dry Plate Company  1884  The Eastman Strong partnership was dissolved and the Eastman Dry Plate and Film Company formed with 14 shareowners  The Eastman Dry Plate Company was responsible for the first cameras suitable for non expert use  1885  George Eastman invented roll film  the basis for the invention of motion picture film  as used by early filmmakers and Thomas Edison  September 4  1888  Eastman registered the trademark Kodak 1888  The first model of the Kodak camera appeared  It took round pictures 6 4 cm  2 5 inches  in diameter  was of the fixed focus type  and carried a roll of film enough for 100 exposures  Its invention practically marked the advent of amateur photography  as before that time both apparatus and processes were too burdensome to classify photography as recreation  The roll film used in the first model of the Kodak camera had a paper base but was soon superseded by a film with a cellulose base  a practical transparent flexible film  34  The first films had to be loaded into the camera and unloaded in the dark room  but the film cartridge system with its protecting strip of non actinic paper made it possible to load and unload the camera in ordinary light  The Kodak Developing Machine  1900  and its simplified successor  the Kodak Film Tank  provided the means for daylight development of film  making the dark room unnecessary for any of the operations of amateur photography  The earlier types of the Kodak cameras were of the box form and of fixed focus  and as various sizes were added  devices for focusing the lenses were incorporated  34  1889  The Eastman Company was formed  1  1891  George Eastman began to produce a second line of cameras  the Ordinary range  35  1892  It was renamed the Eastman Kodak Company in 1892  Eastman Kodak Company of New York was organized  1  He coined the advertising slogan   You press the button  we do the rest   36  The Kodak company thereby attained its name from the first simple roll film cameras produced by Eastman Dry Plate Company  known as the  Kodak  in its product line  Early 1890s  The first folding Kodak cameras were introduced  These were equipped with folding bellows that permitted much greater compactness  1895  The first pocket Kodak camera  the  5 Pocket Kodak  was introduced  37  It was of the box form type  slipping easily into an ordinary coat pocket  and producing negatives 1  x 2 inches  1897  The first folding pocket Kodak camera was introduced  34  and was mentioned in the novel Dracula   edit  1900 to 2000 A Brownie No 2  camera 1900  The Brownie camera was introduced  creating a new mass market for photography  1901  The present company  Eastman Kodak Company of New Jersey  was formed under the laws of that state  Eventually  the business in Jamestown was moved in its entirety to Rochester  and the plants in Jamestown were demolished  By 1920  An  Autographic Feature  provided a means for recording data on the margin of the negative at the time of exposure  This feature was supplied on all Kodak cameras with the exception of a box camera designed for making panoramic pictures 34  and was discontinued in 1932  1920  Tennessee Eastman was founded as a wholly owned subsidiary  The company s primary purpose was the manufacture of chemicals  such as acetyls  needed for Kodak s film photography products  1930  Eastman Kodak Company was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average index on July 18  1930  The company remained listed as one of the DJIA companies for the next 74 years  ending in 2004  38  1935  Kodak introduced Kodachrome  a color reversal stock for movie and slide film  1957  Kodak introduced the Starmatic camera  the first automatic Brownie camera  which was sold in 10 million units over the next five years  1963  Kodak introduced the Instamatic camera  an inexpensive  easy to load  point and shoot camera  1975  Steven Sasson  then an electrical engineer at Kodak  invented the digital camera  39  1976  The Bayer Pattern color filter array  CFA  was invented by Eastman Kodak researcher Bryce Bayer  The order in which dyes are placed on an image sensor photosite is still in use today  The basic technology is still the most commonly used of its kind to date  The company sold 90  of the photographic film in the US along with 85  of the cameras  5  1982  Kodak launches the Kodak Disc film format for consumer cameras  Ultimately the format proves unpopular and was later discontinued  1986  Kodak scientists created the world s first megapixel sensor  capable of recording 1 4 million pixels and producing a photo quality 12 5 x 17 5 cm  5 7 inch  print  1987  Dr  Ching W  Tang  a senior research associate  and his colleague  Steven Van Slyke  developed the first multi layer OLEDs at the Kodak Research Laboratories  for which he later became a Fellow of the Society for Information Display  SID  1993  Eastman Chemical  a Kodak subsidiary founded by George Eastman in 1920 to supply Kodak s chemical needs  was spun off as a separate corporation  Eastman Chemical became a Fortune 500 company in its own right  40  41   edit  2000 to 2010

digitally manage and store medical images and information  42  January 2004  Kodak announced that it would stop selling traditional film cameras in Europe and North America  and cut up to 15 000 jobs  around a fifth of its total workforce at the time   43  44  45  April 8  2004  Kodak was delisted from the Dow Jones Industrial Average index  having been a constituent for 74 consecutive years  38

agreement with Chi Mei Optoelectronics and its affiliate Chi Mei EL  CMEL   enabling CMEL to use Kodak technology for active matrix OLED modules in a variety of small to medium size display applications  55  June 14  2007  Kodak announced a two to fourfold increase in sensitivity to light  from one to two stops  compared to current sensor designs  This design was a departure from the classic  Bayer filter  by adding panchromatic or  clear  pixels to the RGB elements on the sensor array  Since these pixels are sensitive to all wavelengths of visible light  they collect a significantly higher proportion of the light striking the sensor  In combination with advanced Kodak software algorithms optimized for these new patterns  photographers benefited from an increase in photographic speed  improving performance in low light   faster shutter speeds  reducing motion blur for moving subjects   and smaller pixels  higher resolutions in a given optical format  while retaining performance  The technology was credited to Kodak scientists John Compton and John Hamilton  56  September 4  2007  Kodak announced a five year extension of its partnership with Lexar Media

According to scorecard org  a web site that collects information on corporate pollution  Kodak is the worst polluter in New York State  releasing 4 433 749 pounds  2 011 115 kg  of chemicals into the air and water supply  85  The Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts  which compiled the Toxic 100  ranked Kodak the seventh largest polluter in the United States in 2002  86  In 2004  the Citizens  Environmental Coalition s  CEC  of New York awarded Kodak one of its  Dirty Dozen  awards to highlight its consistently high rates of pollution  87  In 2005  the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  granted Kodak the EnergyStar Sustained Excellence Award for  outstanding and continued leadership in reducing greenhouse gas emissions through superior energy management   citation needed  Kodak details its annual progress in global sustainability  as well as health  safety  and environment  in its global sustainability report  88   edit  Controversies  edit  Better Business Bureau expulsion proceedings On March 26  2007  the Council of Better Business Bureaus  CBBB  announced that Eastman Kodak was resigning its national membership in the wake of expulsion proceedings initiated by the CBBB Board of Directors  89  In 2006  Kodak notified the BBB of Upstate New York that it would no longer accept or respond to consumer complaints submitted by them  In prior years  Kodak responded by offering consumers an adjustment or an explanation of the company s position  The BBB file contains consumer complaints of problems with repairs of Kodak digital cameras  as well as difficulty communicating with Kodak customer service  Among other complaints  consumers say that their cameras broke and they were charged for repairs when the failure was not the result of any damage or abuse  Some say their cameras failed again after being repaired  Kodak said its customer service and customer privacy teams concluded that 99 percent of all complaints forwarded by the BBB already were handled directly with the customer  Brian O Connor  Kodak chief privacy officer  said the company was surprised by the news release distributed by the Better Business Bureau  It is inaccurate in the facts presented as well as those the BBB chose to omit  Ironically  we ultimately decided to resign our membership because we were extremely unhappy with the customer service we received from the local office of the BBB  After years of unproductive discussions with the local office regarding their Web site postings about Kodak  which in our view were consistently inaccurate  we came to the conclusion that their process added no value to our own  Our commitment to our customers is unwavering  That will not change  What has changed is that  for us  the BBB s customer complaint process has become redundant  given the multiple and immediate ways that customers have to address their concerns directly with Kodak    90   Kodak  edit  Patent litigation In 2010  Apple filed a patent infringement claim against Kodak  On May 12  2011  Judge Robert Rogers rejected Apple s claims that two of its digital photography patents were being violated by Kodak  91  On July 1  2011  the U S  International Trade Commission partially reversed a January decision by an administrative law judge stating that neither Apple nor Research in Motion had infringed upon Kodak s patents  The ITC remanded the matter for further proceedings before the ALJ  Notice of Commission Determination    edit  In popular culture Kodak is mentioned in Bram Stoker s Dracula  when the novel s protagonist Jonathan Harker notes using his Kodak to take pictures of an estate  Rapper Pitbull mentioned Kodak in his song  Give Me Everything   The Kodak Carousel figured prominently in the AMC TV show Mad Man s episode titled  The Wheel   Set in the 1960s  the fictional advertising agency  Sterling  Cooper  plans an ad campaign for Kodak s new product for slide show projection  92   edit  See
