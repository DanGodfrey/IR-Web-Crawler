Sweden borders with Norway and Finland  and is connected to Denmark by a bridge tunnel across the  resund  At 450 295 square kilometres  173 860 sq mi   Sweden is the third largest country in the European Union by area  with a total population of about 9 4 million  5  Sweden has a low population density of 21 inhabitants per square kilometre  54  sq mi  with the population mostly concentrated to the southern half of the country  About 85  of the population live in urban areas  12  Sweden s capital is Stockholm  which is also the largest city  Sweden emerged as an independent and unified country during the Middle Ages  In the 17th century  the country expanded its territories to form the Swedish Empire  The empire grew to be one of the great powers of Europe in the 17th and early 18th century  Most of the conquered territories outside the Scandinavian Peninsula were lost during the 18th and 19th centuries  The eastern half of Sweden  present day Finland  was lost to Russia in 1809  The last war in which Sweden was directly involved was in 1814  when Sweden by military means forced Norway into a personal union  Since then  Sweden has been at peace  adopting a non aligned foreign

Swedes   Old Norse Sv  j    Latin Suetidi   This word is derived from Sweon Sweonas  Old Norse Sviar  Latin Suiones   The Swedish name Sverige  a conjunction of the words Svea and Rike  first recorded as Sw orice in Beowulf  with the consonant  k  softened to  g  15    compare  rige  in modern Danish  literally means  Kingdom of the Swedes   excluding the Geats in G taland  Variations of the name Sweden are used in most languages  with the exception of Danish and Norwegian using Sverige  Icelandic Sv  j    and the more notable exception of some Finno Ugric languages where Ruotsi  Finnish  and Rootsi  Estonian  are used  names commonly considered etymologically related to the English name for Russia  referring to the people  Rus   originally from the coastal areas of Roslagen  Uppland  The etymology of Swedes  and thus Sweden  is generally not agreed upon but may derive from Proto Germanic Swihoniz meaning  one s own   16  referring to one s own Germanic tribe  History Main article  History of Sweden Prehistory Main article  Prehistoric Sweden Sweden s prehistory begins in the Aller d warm period c  12 000 BC with Late Palaeolithic reindeer hunting camps of the Bromme culture at the edge of the ice in what is now the country s southernmost province  This period was characterized by small bands of hunter gatherer fishers using flint technology  Sweden enters proto history with the Germania of Tacitus in AD 98  In Germania 44  45 he mentions the Swedes  Suiones  as a powerful tribe  distinguished not merely for their arms and men  but for their powerful fleets  with ships that had a prow in both ends  longships   Which kings  kuningaz  ruled these Suiones is unknown  but Norse mythology presents a long line of legendary and semi legendary kings going back to the last centuries BC  As for literacy in Sweden itself  the runic script was in use among the south Scandinavian elite by at least the 2nd century AD  but all that has come down to the present from the Roman Period is curt inscriptions on artefacts  mainly of male names  demonstrating that the people of south Scandinavia spoke Proto Norse at the time  a language ancestral to Swedish and other North Germanic languages  In the 6th century Jordanes named two tribes he calls the Suehans and the Suetidi who lived in Scandza  These two names are both considered to refer to the same tribe  The Suehans  he says  has very fine horses just as the  Thyringi  tribe  alia vero gens ibi moratur Suehans  quae velud Thyringi equis utuntur eximiis   Snorri Sturluson wrote that the contemporary Swedish king Adils  Eadgils  had the finest horses of his days  The Suehans were the suppliers of black fox skins for the Roman market  Then Jordanes names the Suetidi which is considered to be the Latin form of Svitjod  He writes that the Suetidi are the tallest of men together with the Dani who were of the same stock  Later he mentions other Scandinavian tribes for being of the same height  Originating in semi legendary Scandza  believed to be somewhere in modern G taland  Sweden  a Gothic population had crossed the Baltic Sea before the 2nd century AD  reaching Scythia at the coast of the Black Sea in modern Ukraine where Goths left their archaeological traces in the Chernyakhov culture  In the 5th and 6th centuries  they became divided as the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths  and established powerful successor states of the Roman Empire in the Iberian peninsula and Italy  17 Crimean Gothic communities appear to have survived intact in Crimea until the late 18th century  18  Viking and Middle Ages See also  Early Swedish history  Foundation of Modern Sweden  and Varangians The Swedish Viking Age lasted roughly between the 8th and 11th centuries  It is believed that Swedish Vikings and Gutar mainly travelled east and south  going to Finland  the Baltic countries  Russia  Belarus  Ukraine the Black Sea and further as far as Baghdad  Their routes passed through the Dnieper down south to Constantinople  on which they did numerous raids  The Byzantine Emperor Theophilos noticed their great skills in war and invited them to serve as his personal bodyguard  known as the varangian guard  The Swedish Vikings  called  Rus  are also believed to be the founding fathers of Kievan Rus  The Arabic traveller  Ibn Fadlan  described these Vikings as following  I have seen the Rus as they came on their merchant journeys and encamped by the Itil  I have never seen more perfect physical specimens  tall as date palms  blond and ruddy  they wear neither tunics nor caftans  but the men wear a garment which covers one side of the body and leaves a hand free  Each man has an axe  a sword  and a knife  and keeps each by him at all times  The swords are broad and grooved  of Frankish sort  19  The adventures of these Swedish Vikings are commemorated on many runestones in Sweden  such as the Greece Runestones and the Varangian Runestones  There was also considerable participation in expeditions westwards  which are commemorated on stones such as the England Runestones  The last major Swedish Viking expedition appears to have been the ill fated expedition of Ingvar the Far Travelled to Serkland  the region south east of the Caspian Sea  Its members are commemorated on the Ingvar Runestones  none of which mentions any survivor  What happened to the crew is unknown  but it is believed that they died of sickness  The Kingdom of Sweden It is not known when and how the kingdom of Sweden was born  but the list of Swedish monarchs is drawn from the first kings known to have ruled both Svealand  Sweden  and G taland  Gothia  as one province  beginning with Erik the Victorious  Sweden and Gothia were two separate nations long before that into antiquity  It is not known how long they existed  Beowulf described semi legendary Swedish Geatish wars in the 6th century  Gamla Uppsala  a site of religious and political importance in the early days of Sweden  Cultural advances During the early stages of the Scandinavian Viking Age  Ystad in Scania and Paviken on Gotland  in present day Sweden  were flourishing trade centres  Remains of what is believed to have been a large market have been found in Ystad dating from 600 700 AD  20  In Paviken  an important centre of trade in the Baltic region during the 9th and 10th century  remains have been found of a large Viking Age harbour with shipbuilding yards and handicraft industries  Between 800 and 1000  trade brought an abundance of silver to Gotland  and according to some scholars  the Gotlanders of this era hoarded more silver than the rest of the population of Scandinavia combined  20  St  Ansgar is usually credited for introducing Christianity in 829  but the new religion did not begin to fully replace paganism until the 12th century  During the 11th century  Christianity became the most prevalent religion  and from 1050 Sweden is counted as a Christian nation  The period between 1100 and 1400 was characterized by internal power struggles and competition among the Nordic kingdoms  Swedish kings also began to expand the Swedish controlled territory in Finland  creating conflicts with the Rus who no longer had any connection with Sweden  21  Feudal institutions in Sweden Except for the province of Skane  on the southernmost tip of Sweden which was under Danish control during this time  feudalism never developed in Sweden as it did in the rest of Europe  22  Therefore  the peasantry remained largely a class of free farmers throughout most of Swedish history  Slavery  also called thralldom  was not common in Sweden  23  and what slavery there was tended to be driven out of existence by the spread of Christianity  the difficulty in obtaining slaves from the lands east of the Baltic Sea  and by the development of cities before the 16th century 24  Indeed  both slavery and serfdom were abolished altogether by a decree of King Magnus Erickson in 1335  Former slaves tended to be absorbed into the peasantry and some became labourers in the towns  Still  Sweden remained a poor and economically backward country in which barter was the means of exchange  For instance  the farmers of the province of Dalsland would transport their butter to the mining districts of Sweden and exchange it there for iron  which they would then take down to the coast and trade the iron for fish they needed for food while the iron would be shipped abroad  25  Valdemar IV takes control over Swedish Gotland  The final fight outside the walls of Visby ended with a total massacre of 1 800 Gotlanders  The Plague in Sweden In the 14th century  Sweden was struck by the Black Death  The population of Sweden was decimated  26  During this period the Swedish cities also began to acquire greater rights and were strongly influenced by German merchants of the Hanseatic League  active especially at Visby  In 1319  Sweden and Norway were united under King Magnus Eriksson  and in 1397 Queen Margaret I of Denmark effected the personal union of Sweden  Norway  and Denmark through the Kalmar Union  However  Margaret s successors  whose rule was also centred in Denmark  were unable to control the Swedish nobility  Minors and Regents A large number of children inherited the Swedish crown over the course of the kingdom s existence  consequently   real power was held for long periods by regents  notably those of the Sture family  chosen by the Swedish parliament  King Christian II of Denmark  who asserted his claim to Sweden by force of arms  ordered a massacre in 1520 of Swedish nobles at Stockholm  This came to be known as the  Stockholm blood bath  and stirred the Swedish nobility to new resistance and  on 6 June  now Sweden s national holiday  in 1523  they made Gustav Vasa their king  27  This is sometimes considered as the foundation of modern Sweden  Shortly afterwards he rejected Catholicism and led Sweden into the Protestant Reformation  Economically  Gustav Vasa broke the monopoly of the Hanseatic League over Swedish Baltic Sea trade  28  The Hanseatic League had been officially formed at L beck on the sea coast of Northern Germany in 1356  The Hanseatic League sought civil and commercial privileges from the princes and royalty of the countries and cities along the coasts of the Baltic Sea  29  In exchange they offered a certain amount of protection  Having their own navy the Hansa were able to sweep the Baltic Sea free of pirates  30  The privileges obtained by the Hansa included assurances that only Hansa citizens would be allowed to trade from the ports where they were located  They also sought agreement to be free of all customs and taxes  With these concessions  L beck merchants flocked to Stockholm  Sweden and soon came to dominate the economic life of that city and made the port city of Stockholm into the leading commercial and industrial city of Sweden  31  Under the Hanseatic trade 2 3rds of Stockholm s imports consisted of textiles and 1 3 of salt  Exports from Sweden consisted of iron and copper  32  However  the Swedes began to resent the monopoly trading position of the Hansa  mostly German citizens  and to resent the income they felt they lost to the Hansa  Consequently  when Gustav Vasa or Gustav I broke the monopoly power of the Hanseatic League he was regarded as a hero to the Swedish people  History now views Gustav I as the father of the modern Swedish nation  The foundations laid by Gustav would take time to develop  Furthermore  when Sweden did develop  freed itself from the Hanseatic League and entered its golden era  the fact the peasantry had traditionally been free meant that more of the economic benefits flowed back to them rather than going to a feudal landowning class  33  This was not the case in other countries of Europe like Poland where the peasantry was still bound by serfdom and a strong feudalistic land owning system  Swedish Empire The Swedish Empire between 1560 and 1815

During the 17th century Sweden emerged as a European great power  Before the emergence of the Swedish Empire  Sweden was a very poor and scarcely populated country on the fringe of European civilization  with no significant power or reputation  Sweden rose to prominence on a continental scale during the tenure of king Gustavus Adolphus  seizing territories from Russia and Poland Lithuania in multiple conflicts  including the Thirty Years  War  During the Thirty Years  War  Sweden conquered approximately half of the Holy Roman states  Gustav Adolphus planned to become the new Holy Roman Emperor  ruling over a united Scandinavia and the Holy Roman states  but he died at the Battle of L tzen in 1632  After the Battle of N rdlingen  Sweden s only significant military defeat of the war  pro Swedish sentiment among the German states faded  These German provinces excluded themselves from Swedish power one by one  leaving Sweden with only a few northern German territories  Swedish Pomerania  Bremen Verden and Wismar  The Swedish armies may have destroyed up to 2 000 castles  18 000 villages and 1 500 towns in Germany  one third of all German towns  34  Stockholm in mid 17th century In the middle of the 17th century Sweden was the third largest country in Europe by land area  only surpassed by Russia and Spain  Sweden reached its largest territorial extent under the rule of Charles X after the treaty of Roskilde in 1658  35  36  The foundation of Sweden s success during this period is credited to Gustav I s major changes on the Swedish economy in the 16th century  and his introduction of Protestantism  37  In the 17th century  Sweden was engaged in many wars  for example with the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth with both sides competing for territories of today s Baltic states  with the disastrous Battle of Kircholm being one of the highlights  38  One third of the Finnish population died in the devastating famine that struck the country in 1696  39  Famine also hit Sweden  40  killing roughly 10  of Sweden s population  41  The Swedes conducted a series of invasions into the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth  known as the Deluge  After more than half a century of almost constant warfare  the Swedish economy had deteriorated  It became the lifetime task of Charles  son  Charles XI  to rebuild the economy and refit the army  His legacy to his son  the coming ruler of Sweden Charles XII  was one of the finest arsenals in the world  a large standing army and a great fleet  Sweden s largest threat at this time  Russia  had a larger army but was far behind in both equipment and training  Death of Gustav II Adolf at the Battle of L tzen After the Battle of Narva in 1700  one of the first battles of the Great Northern War  the Russian army was so severely decimated that Sweden had an open chance to invade Russia  However  Charles did not pursue the Russian army  instead turning against Poland Lithuania and defeating the Polish king Augustus II and his Saxon allies at the Battle of Kliszow in 1702  This gave Russia time to rebuild and modernize its army  After the success of invading Poland  Charles decided to make an invasion attempt of Russia which ended in a decisive Russian victory at the Battle of Poltava in 1709  After a long march exposed to Cossack raids  Russian Tsar Peter the Great s scorched earth techniques and the cold Russian climate  the Swedes stood weakened with a shattered morale and enormously outnumbered against the Russian army at Poltava  The defeat meant the beginning of the end for the Swedish Empire  The Battle of Poltava in 1709  In the years following Poltava  Russia occupied all the Swedish annexations on the Baltic coast and even Finland  Charles XII attempted to invade Norway 1716  however  he was shot dead at Fredriksten fortress in 1718  The Swedes were not militarily defeated at Fredriksten  but the whole structure and organization of the Norwegian campaign fell apart with the king s death  and the army withdrew  Forced to cede large areas of land in the Treaty of Nystad in 1721  Sweden also lost its place as an empire and as the dominant state on the Baltic Sea  With Sweden s lost influence  Russia emerged as an empire and became one of Europe s dominant nations  As the war finally ended in 1721  Sweden had lost an estimated 200 000 men  150 000 of those from the area of present day Sweden and 50 000 from the Finnish part of Sweden  42  In the 18th century  Sweden did not have enough resources to maintain its territories outside Scandinavia  and most of them were lost  culminating with the 1809 loss of eastern Sweden to Russia which became the highly autonomous Grand Principality of Finland in Imperial Russia  In interest of re establishing Swedish dominance in the Baltic Sea  Sweden allied itself against its traditional ally and benefactor  France  in the Napoleonic Wars  Sweden s role in the Battle of Leipzig gave it the authority to force Denmark Norway  an ally of France  to cede Norway to the King of Sweden on 14 January 1814 in exchange for northern German provinces  at the Treaty of Kiel  The Norwegian attempts to keep their status as a sovereign state were rejected by the Swedish king  Charles XIII  He launched a military campaign against Norway on 27 July 1814  ending in the Convention of Moss  which forced Norway into a personal union with Sweden under the Swedish crown  which lasted until 1905  The 1814 campaign was the last war in which Sweden participated as a combatant  Swedish troops partake in peace keeping missions and currently have forces deployed in Afghanistan and Kosovo  Modern history See also  Modernization of Sweden and Swedish emigration to the United States Swedish emigrants boarding ship in Gothenburg in 1905 There was a significant population increase during the 18th and 19th centuries  which the writer Esaias Tegn r in 1833 attributed to  the peace  the  smallpox  vaccine  and the potatoes   43  Between 1750 and 1850  the population in Sweden doubled  According to some scholars  mass emigration to America became the only way to prevent famine and rebellion  over 1  of the population emigrated annually during the 1880s  44  Nevertheless  Sweden remained poor  retaining a nearly entirely agricultural economy even as Denmark and Western European countries began to industrialize  44  45  Illustration of starvation in northern Sweden  Famine of 1866 1868 Many looked towards America for a better life during this time  It is believed that between 1850 and 1910 more than one million Swedes moved to the United States  46  In the early 20th century  more Swedes lived in Chicago than in Gothenburg  Sweden s second largest city   47  Most Swedish immigrants moved to the Midwestern United States  with a large population in Minnesota  with a few others moving to other parts of the United States and Canada  Despite the slow rate of industrialization into the 19th century  many important changes were taking place in the agrarian economy because of innovations and the large population growth  48  These innovations included government sponsored programs of enclosure  aggressive exploitation of agricultural lands  and the introduction of new crops such as the potato  48  Because the Swedish peasantry had never been enserfed as elsewhere in Europe  49  the Swedish farming culture began to take on a critical role in the Swedish political process  which has continued through modern times with modern Agrarian party  now called the Centre Party   50  Between 1870 and 1914  Sweden began developing the industrialized economy that exists today  51  Strong grassroots movements sprung up in Sweden during the latter half of the 19th century  trade unions  temperance groups  and independent religious groups   creating a strong foundation of democratic principles  In 1889 The Swedish Social Democratic Party was founded  These movements precipitated Sweden s migration into a modern parliamentary democracy  achieved by the time of World War I  As the Industrial Revolution progressed during the 20th century  people gradually began moving into cities to work in factories and became involved in socialist unions  A communist revolution was avoided in 1917  following the re introduction of parliamentarism  and the country was democratized  World Wars See also  Sweden during World War II Swedish soldier during World War II Sweden remained officially neutral during World War I and World War II  although its neutrality during World War II has been disputed  52  53  Sweden was under German influence for much of the war  as ties to the rest of the world were cut off through blockades  52  The Swedish government felt that it was in no position to openly contest Germany  54  and therefore made some concessions  55  Sweden also supplied steel and machined parts to Germany throughout the war  However  Sweden supported Norwegian resistance  and in 1943 helped rescue Danish Jews from deportation to concentration camps  Sweden also supported Finland in the Winter War and the Continuation War with volunteers and materiel  Toward the end of the war  Sweden began to play a role in humanitarian efforts and many refugees  among them many Jews from Nazi occupied Europe  were saved partly because of the Swedish involvement in rescue missions at the internment camps and partly because Sweden served as a haven for refugees  primarily from the Nordic countries and the Baltic states  54  The Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg and his colleagues may have saved up to 100 000 Hungarian Jews  56  Nevertheless  internal and external critics have argued that Sweden could have done more to resist the Nazi war effort  even if risking occupation  54  Post war era Sweden was officially a neutral country and remained outside NATO or Warsaw pact membership during the cold war  but privately Sweden s leadership had strong ties with the United States and other western governments  A typical red house in T llberg  Sweden Following the war  Sweden took advantage of an intact industrial base  social stability and its natural resources to expand its industry to supply the rebuilding of Europe  57  Sweden was part of the Marshall Plan and participated in the Organization of Economic Co operation and Development  OECD   During most of the post war era  the country was governed by the Swedish Social Democratic Party largely in cooperation with trade unions and industry  The government actively pursued an internationally competitive manufacturing sector of primarily large corporations  58  Sweden  like countries around the globe  entered a period of economic decline and upheaval  following the oil embargoes of 1973 74 and 1978 79  59  In the 1980s pillars of Swedish industry were massively restructured  Shipbuilding was discontinued  wood pulp was integrated into modernized paper production  the steel industry was concentrated and specialized  and mechanical engineering was robotized  60  Between 1970 and 1990 the overall tax burden rose by over 10   and the growth was low compared to other countries in Western Europe  Eventually government spent over half of the country s gross domestic product  Sweden GDP per capita ranking declined during this time  58  Recent history See also  History of Sweden  since 1989  Sweden joined the European Union in 1995 and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007  A bursting real estate bubble caused by inadequate controls on lending combined with an international recession and a policy switch from anti unemployment policies to anti inflationary policies resulted in a fiscal crisis in the early 1990s  61  Sweden s GDP declined by around 5   In 1992  there was a run on the currency  with the central bank briefly jacking up interest to 500   62  63  The response of the government was to cut spending and institute a multitude of reforms to improve Sweden s competitiveness  among them reducing the welfare state and privatising public services and goods  Much of the political establishment promoted EU membership  and the Swedish referendum passed with 52  in favour of joining the EU on 13 November 1994  Sweden joined the European Union on 1 January 1995  Sweden remains non aligned militarily  although it participates in some joint military exercises with NATO and some other countries  in addition to extensive cooperation with other European countries in the area of defence technology and defence industry  Among others  Swedish companies export weapons that are used by the American military in Iraq  64  Sweden also has a long history of participating in international military operations  including most recently  Afghanistan  where Swedish troops are under NATO command  and in EU sponsored peacekeeping operations in UN protectorate Kosovo  Bosnia and Herzegovina  and Cyprus  Sweden held the chair of the European Union from 1 July to 31 December 2009  Geography Main article

provinces serve no political or administrative purpose  they play an important role for people s self identification  The provinces are usually grouped together in three large lands  parts  the northern Norrland  the central Svealand and southern G taland  The sparsely populated Norrland encompasses almost 60  of the country  About 15  of Sweden lies north of the Arctic Circle  Southern Sweden is predominantly agricultural  with increasing forest coverage northward  Around 65  of Sweden s total land area is covered with forests  The highest population density is in the  resund Region

help reach a consensus    The Scandinavian Mountains Most of Sweden has a temperate climate  despite its northern latitude  with four distinct seasons and mild temperatures throughout the year  The country can be divided into three types of climate  the southernmost part has an oceanic climate  the central part has a humid continental climate and the northernmost part has a subarctic climate  However  Sweden is much warmer and drier than other places at a similar latitude  and even somewhat farther south  mainly because of the Gulf Stream  66  67  For example  central and southern Sweden has much warmer winters than many parts of Russia  Canada  and the northern United States  68  Because of its high latitude  the length of daylight varies greatly  North of the Arctic Circle  the sun

1 Politics Main article  Politics of Sweden Sweden is a constitutional monarchy  in which King Carl XVI Gustaf is head of state  but royal power has long been limited to official and ceremonial functions  81  The Economist Intelligence Unit  while acknowledging that democracy is difficult to measure  listed Sweden in fourth place in 2010 in its index of democracy assessing 167 countries  The nation s legislative body is the riksdag  Swedish Parliament   with 349 members  which chooses the Prime Minister  Parliamentary elections are held every four years  on the third Sunday of September  Sweden municipal borders Administrative divisions Main articles  Counties of Sweden and Municipalities of Sweden Sweden is a unitary state  currently divided into twenty one counties  l n   Stockholm  Uppsala  S dermanland   sterg tland  J nk ping  Kronoberg  Kalmar  Gotland  Blekinge  Sk ne  Halland  V stra G taland  V rmland   rebro  V stmanland  Dalarna  G vleborg  V sternorrland  J mtland  V sterbotten and Norrbotten  Each county has a County Administrative Board or l nsstyrelse  which is a Government appointed board  It is led by a Governor or Landsh vding appointed for a term of six years and the list of succession  in most cases  stretches back to 1634 when the counties were created by the Swedish Lord High Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna  The main responsibility of the County Administrative Board is to coordinate the development of the county in line with goals set in national politics  In each county there is also a County Council or landsting which is a policy making assembly elected by the residents of the county  Each county further divides into a number of municipalities or kommuner  with a total of 290 municipalities in 2004  Municipal government in Sweden is similar to city commission government and cabinet style council government  A legislative municipal assembly  kommunfullm ktige  of between 31 and 101 members  always an uneven number  is elected from party list proportional representation at municipal elections  held every four years in conjunction with the national parliamentary elections  The municipalities are divided into a total of 2 512 parishes  or f rsamlingar  These have traditionally been a subdivision of the Church of Sweden but still have importance as districts for census and elections  There are older historical divisions  primarily the twenty five provinces and three lands  which still retain cultural significance  Further information  Subdivisions of Sweden and National Areas of Sweden Political history Kingdoms of Svear  Sweonas  and G tar  Geats  in the 12th century  with modern borders in grey The actual age of the kingdom of Sweden is unknown  82  It depends mostly on whether Sweden should be considered a nation when the Svear  Sweonas  ruled Svealand or if the emergence of the nation started with the Svear and the G tar  Geats  of G taland being united under one ruler  In the first case  Sweden was first mentioned as having one single ruler in the year 98 by Tacitus  but it is almost impossible to know for how long it had been this way  However  historians usually start the line of Swedish monarchs from when Svealand and G taland were ruled under the same king  namely Erik the Victorious  Geat  and his son Olof Sk tkonung in the 10th century  These events are often described as the consolidation of Sweden  although substantial areas were conquered and incorporated later  Earlier kings  for which no reliable historical sources exist  can be read about in mythical kings of Sweden and semi legendary kings of Sweden  Many of these kings are only mentioned in various saga and blend with Norse mythology  The title Sveriges och G tes Konung was last used for Gustaf I of Sweden  after which the title became  King of Sweden  of the Goths and of the Wends   Sveriges  G tes och Vendes Konung  in official documentation  Up until the beginning of the 1920s  all laws in Sweden were introduced with the words   We  the king of Sweden  of the Goths and Wends   This title was used up until 1973  83  The present King of Sweden  Carl XVI Gustaf  was the first monarch officially proclaimed  King of Sweden   Sveriges Konung  with no additional peoples mentioned in his title  The term riksdag was used for the first time in the 1540s  although the first meeting where representatives of different social groups were called to discuss and determine affairs affecting the country as a whole took place as early as 1435  in the town of Arboga  84  During the assemblies of 1527 and 1544  under King Gustav Vasa  representatives of all four estates of the realm  clergy  nobility  townsmen and peasants  were called on to participate for the first time  84  The monarchy became hereditary in 1544  Executive power was historically shared between the King and a noble Privy Council until 1680  followed by the King s autocratic rule initiated by the common estates of the Parliament  As a reaction to the failed Great Northern War  a parliamentary system was introduced in 1719  followed by three different flavours of constitutional monarchy in 1772  1789 and 1809  the latter granting several civil liberties  The monarch remains as the formal  but merely symbolic  head of state with ceremonial duties  The Riksdag of the Estates consisted of two chambers  In 1866 Sweden became a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral parliament  with the First Chamber indirectly elected by local governments  and the Second Chamber directly elected in national elections every four years  In 1971 the parliament became unicameral  Legislative power was  symbolically  shared between king and parliament until 1975  Swedish taxation is controlled by the Parliament of Sweden  riksdagen   Sweden has a history of strong political involvement by ordinary people through its  popular movements   Folkr relser   the most notable being trade unions  the independent Christian movement  the temperance movement  the women s movement and more recently the sports clarification needed  and intellectual property pirate movements  Sweden is currently leading the EU in statistics measuring equality in the political system and equality in the education system  85  The Global Gender Gap Report 2006 ranked Sweden as the number one country in terms of gender equality  86  Political system The Parliament House in Stockholm  Carl XVI Gustaf  the King of Sweden and ceremonial head of state Constitutionally  the 349 member riksdag  Parliament  holds supreme authority in modern Sweden  The riksdag is responsible for choosing the prime minister  who then appoints the government department heads  cabinet ministers   Legislative power is only exercised by the riksdag  Executive power is exercised by the prime minister and the cabinet  while the judiciary is independent  Sweden lacks compulsory judicial review  although the non compulsory review carried out by lagr det  Law Council  is mostly respected in technical matters but less so in controversial political matters  Acts of the parliament and government decrees can be made inapplicable at every level if they are manifestly against constitutional laws  However  because of the restrictions in this form of judicial review and a weak judiciary  this has had little practical consequence  Legislation may be initiated by the cabinet or by members of Parliament  Members are elected on the basis of proportional representation to a four year term  The Constitution of Sweden can be altered by the riksdag  which requires a simple but absolute majority with two separate votes  separated by general elections in between  Sweden has three other constitutional laws  the Act of Royal Succession  the Freedom of Press Act and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression  The Swedish Social Democratic Party has played a leading political role since 1917  after Reformists had confirmed their strength and the revolutionaries left the party  After 1932  cabinets have been dominated by the Social Democrats  Only five general elections  1976  1979  1991  2006 and 2010  have given the centre right bloc enough seats in Parliament to form a government  However  due to poor economic performance since the beginning of the 1970s  and especially since the fiscal crisis of the early 1990s  Sweden s political system has become less one sided  and more like other European countries  In the 2006 general election the Moderate Party  allied with the Centre Party  Liberal People s Party  and the Christian Democrats formed the centre right Alliance for Sweden and won a majority of the votes  Together they formed a majority government under the leadership of the Moderate party s leader Fredrik Reinfeldt  In the September 2010 election the Alliance contended against a unified left block consisting of the Social Democrats  the Greens and the Left Party  It also saw the first election of the Sweden Democrats into the riksdag  87  Following is the current party lineup in the Swedish parliament  as of October 2011 update   organized by voting blocks  88  English name Swedish name Abbr  Seats

international comparison  although it has declined in recent decades  and is currently around 80   80 11 in 2002  and 81 99  in 2006   Swedish politicians enjoyed a high degree of confidence from the citizens in the 1960s  However  that confidence level has since declined steadily  and is now at a markedly lower level than in its Scandinavian neighbours  91  Some Swedish political figures have become known worldwide  among these are  Raoul Wallenberg  Folke Bernadotte  former Secretary General of the United Nations Dag Hammarskj ld  former Prime Minister Olof Palme  former Prime Minister and Foreign minister Carl Bildt  former President of the General Assembly of the United Nations Jan Eliasson  and former International Atomic Energy Agency Iraq inspector Hans Blix  Law  law enforcement  and judicial system Main article  Judicial system of Sweden The Supreme Court of Sweden is the third and final instance in all civil and criminal cases in Sweden  Before a case can be decided by the Supreme Court  leave to appeal must be obtained  and with few exceptions  leave to appeal can be granted only when the case is of interest as a precedent  The Supreme Court consists of 16 Councillors of Justice or justitier d which are appointed by the government  but the court as an institution is independent of the Parliament of Sweden  and the government is not able to interfere with the decisions of the court  Law enforcement in Sweden is carried out by several government entities  The Swedish Police Service is a Government agency concerned with police matters  The National Task Force is a national SWAT unit within the National Criminal Investigation Department  Swedish Security Service s responsibilities are counter espionage  anti terrorist activities  protection of the constitution and protection of sensitive objects and people  According to a victimization survey of 1 201 residents in 2005  Sweden has above average crime rates compared to other EU countries  Sweden has high or above average levels of assaults  sexual assaults  hate crimes  and consumer fraud  Sweden has low levels of burglary  car theft and drug problems  Bribe seeking is rare  92  Foreign relations Main article  Foreign relations of Sweden Throughout the 20th century  Swedish foreign policy was based on the principle of non alignment in peacetime and neutrality in wartime  Sweden s government pursued an independent course of nonalignment in times of peace so that neutrality would be possible in the event of war  57  Sweden s doctrine of neutrality is often traced back to the 19th century as the country has not been in a state of war since the end of the Swedish campaign against Norway in 1814  During World War II Sweden joined neither the allied nor axis powers  This has sometimes been disputed since in effect Sweden allowed in select cases the Nazi regime to use its railroad system to transport troops and goods  52  54  especially iron ore from mines in northern Sweden  which was vital to the German war machine  54  93  However  Sweden also indirectly contributed to the defence of Finland in the Winter War  and permitted the training of Norwegian and Danish troops in Sweden after 1943  Development aid measured in GNI in 2009  Source  OECD  As a percentage Sweden is the largest donor  During the early Cold War era  Sweden combined its policy of non alignment and a low profile in international affairs with a security policy based on strong national defence  94  The function of the Swedish military was to deter attack  95  At the same time  the country maintained relatively close informal connections with the Western bloc  especially in the realm of intelligence exchange  In 1952  a Swedish DC 3 was shot down over the Baltic Sea by a Soviet MiG 15 jet fighter  Later investigations revealed that the plane was actually gathering information for NATO  96  Another plane  a Catalina search and rescue plane  was sent out a few days later and shot down by the Soviets as well  Olof Palme  the former prime minister of Sweden  visited Cuba during the 1970s and showed his support for Cuba in his speech  Beginning in the late 1960s  Sweden for a period attempted to play a more significant and independent role in international relations  This involved significant activity in international peace efforts  especially through the United Nations  and in support to the Third World  Since the assassination of Olof Palme in 1986 and the end of the Cold War  this has been significantly toned down  although Sweden remains comparatively active in peace keeping missions and maintains a generous foreign aid budget  In 1981 a Soviet Whiskey class submarine ran aground close to the Swedish naval base at Karlskrona in the southern part of the country  It has never been clearly established whether the submarine ended up on the shoals through a navigational mistake or if it was a matter of espionage against Swedish military potential  The incident triggered a diplomatic crisis between Sweden and the Soviet Union  Since 1995 Sweden has been a member of the European Union  and as a consequence of a new world security situation the country s foreign policy doctrine has been partly modified  with Sweden playing a more active role in European security co operation  Military Main article  Swedish Armed Forces The JAS 39 Gripen is an advanced Swedish multi role fighter aircraft of the Swedish Air Force  F rsvarsmakten  Swedish Armed Forces  is a government agency reporting to the Swedish Ministry of Defence and responsible for the peacetime operation of the armed forces of Sweden  The primary task of the agency is to train and deploy peace support forces abroad  while maintaining the long term ability to refocus on the defence of Sweden in the event of war  The armed forces are divided into Army  Air Force and Navy  The head of the armed forces is the Supreme Commander   verbef lhavaren   B   the most senior officer in the country  Up to 1974 the head of state   the King  was pro forma Commander in Chief  but in reality it was clearly understood all through the 20th century that the Monarch would have no active role as a military leader  When King Gustav V asserted his right to decide and bypass the government in military matters just before the First World War   borgg rdskrisen   the Castle Court Crisis  it was seen as a deliberate provocation against established terms of how the country would be ruled  The office of an appointed Supreme Commander was set up in 1939  before that date  from the late 19th century onwards  the leading men of the army and navy would report directly to the cabinet  and the king   and no fully unified command existed in the professional military sphere itself  The Infantry fighting vehicle Strf 90 produced and used by Sweden  Until the end of the Cold War  nearly all males reaching the age of military service were conscripted  In recent years  the number of conscripted males has shrunk dramatically  while the number of female volunteers has increased slightly  Recruitment has generally shifted towards finding the most motivated recruits  rather than solely those otherwise most fit for service  All soldiers serving abroad must by law be volunteers  In 1975 the total number of conscripts was 45 000  By 2003 it was down to 15 000  On 1 July 2010 Sweden stopped routine conscription  switching to an all volunteer force unless otherwise required for defence readiness  97  98  99  The need to recruit only the soldiers later prepared to volunteer for international service will be emphasized  The total forces gathered would consist of about 60 000 men  This could be compared with the 80s before the fall of the Soviet Union  when Sweden could gather up to 1 000 000 men  Swedish units have taken part in peacekeeping operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo  Cyprus  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Kosovo  Liberia  Lebanon  Afghanistan and Chad  Currently  one of the most important tasks for the Swedish Armed Forces has been to form a Swedish led EU Battle Group to which Norway  Finland  Ireland and Estonia will also contribute  100  The

United States or Ireland  The share of employment financed via tax income amounts to a third of Swedish workforce  a substantially higher proportion than in most other countries  Overall  GDP growth has been fast since reforms in the early 1990s  especially in manufacturing  105  The World Economic Forum 2009 2010 competitiveness index ranks Sweden the 4th most competitive economy in the world

Biomass is mainly used to produce heat for district heating and central heating and industry processes  The 1973 oil crisis strengthened Sweden s commitment to decrease dependence on imported fossil fuels  Since then  electricity has been generated mostly from hydropower and nuclear power  The use of nuclear power has been limited  however  Among other things  the accident of Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station  United States  prompted the Swedish parliament to ban new nuclear plants  In March 2005  an opinion poll showed that 83  supported maintaining or increasing nuclear power

highly developed welfare states in the world  The country has a higher level of social spending to GDP than any other nation  Additionally it provides equal as well as comprehensive access to education and health care  Historically  Sweden provided solid support for free trade  except agriculture  and mostly relatively strong and stable property rights  both private and public   though some economists have pointed out that Sweden promoted industries with tariffs and used publicly subsidised R amp D during the country s early critical years of industrialisation  114  After World War II a succession of governments expanded the welfare state by raising the tax level  During this period Sweden s economic growth was also one of the highest in the industrial world  A series of successive social reforms transformed the country into one of the most equal and developed on earth  The consistent growth of the welfare state led to Swedes achieving unprecedented levels of social mobility and quality of life to this day Sweden consistently ranks at the top of league tables for health  literacy and Human Development far ahead of some wealthier countries  for example the United States   115  However  from the 1970s and onwards Sweden s GDP growth fell behind other industrialised countries and the country s per capita ranking fell from the 4th to 14th place in a few decades  116  From the mid 90s until today Sweden s economic growth has once again accelerated and has been higher than in most other industrialised countries  including the US  during the last 15 years  117  Sweden began slowing the expansion of the welfare state in the 1980s  or even trimming it back  and according to the OECD and McKinsey  Sweden has recently been relatively quick to adopt neo liberal policies  such as deregulation  compared to countries such as France  103  118  The current Swedish government is continuing the trend of moderate rollbacks of previous social reforms  103  119  Growth has been higher than in many other EU 15 countries  Sweden adopted neo liberal agricultural policies in 1990  Since the 1930s  the agricultural sector had been subject to price controls  In June 1990  the Parliament voted for a new agricultural policy marking a significant shift away from price controls  As a result  food prices fell somewhat  However  the liberalizations soon became moot because EU agricultural controls supervened  120  Since the late 1960s  Sweden has had the highest tax quota  as percentage of GDP  in the industrialised world  although today the gap has narrowed and Denmark has surpassed Sweden as the most heavily taxed country among developed countries  Sweden has a two step progressive tax scale with a municipal income tax of about 30  and an additional high income state tax of 20 25  when a salary exceeds roughly 320 000 SEK per year  Payroll taxes amount to 32   In addition  a national VAT of 25  is added to many things bought by private

third of the workforce  much more than in most Western countries  Only Denmark has a larger public sector  38  of Danish workforce   Spending on transfers is also high  Eighty percent of the workforce is organised in trade unions which also have the right to elect two representatives to the board in all Swedish companies with more than 25 employees  Sweden has a relatively high amount of sick leave

positive trend continued during the first half of 2008  but the rate of increase slackened  According to Statistics Sweden  the unemployment rate in December 2008 was at 6 4   122  Science Altogether  the public and the private sector in Sweden allocate nearly four per cent of GDP to research  amp  development  R amp D  per year  which makes Sweden one of the countries that invest most in R amp D

pharmaceuticals  electronics and other high tech industries are gaining ground  Tetra Pak was an invention for storing liquid foods  invented by Erik Wallenberg  Losec  an ulcer medicine  was the world s best selling drug in the 1990s and was developed by AstraZeneca  More recently H kan Lans invented the Automatic Identification System  a worldwide standard for shipping and civil aviation

and Languages of Sweden See also  Swedish dialects Distribution of speakers of the Swedish language The official language of Sweden is Swedish  8  9  a North Germanic language  related and very similar to Danish and Norwegian  but differing in pronunciation and orthography  Norwegians have little difficulty understanding Swedish  and Danes can also understand it  with slightly more difficulty than the Norwegians  The dialects spoken in Scania  the southernmost part of the country  are influenced by Danish because the region traditionally was a part of Denmark and is nowadays situated closely to it  Sweden Finns are Sweden s largest linguistic minority  comprising about 5  of Sweden s population  2  and Finnish is recognized as a minority language  9  Along with Finnish  four other minority languages are also recognized  Me nkieli  Sami  Romani and Yiddish  Swedish became Sweden s official language on 1 July 2009  when a new language law was implemented  9  The issue of whether Swedish should be declared the official language has been raised in the past  and the parliament voted on the matter in 2005  but the proposal narrowly failed  130  In varying degrees  depending largely on frequency of interaction with English  a majority of Swedes  especially those born after World War II  understand and speak English due to trade links  the popularity of overseas travel  a strong Anglo American influence and the tradition of subtitling rather than dubbing foreign television shows and films  and the relative similarity of the two languages which makes learning English easier  In a 2005 survey by Eurobarometer  89  of Swedes reported the ability to speak English  131  English became a compulsory subject for secondary school students studying natural sciences as early as 1849  and has been a compulsory subject for all Swedish students since the late 1940s  132  Depending on the local school authorities  English is currently a compulsory subject between first grade and ninth grade  with all students continuing in secondary school studying English for at least another year  Most students also study one and sometimes two additional languages  These include  but are not limited to  German  French and Spanish  Some Danish and Norwegian is at times also taught as part of Swedish courses for native speakers  Religion Main article  Religion in Sweden Before the 11th century  Swedes adhered to Norse paganism  worshiping  sir gods  with its centre at the Temple in Uppsala  With Christianization in the 11th century  the laws of the country were changed  forbidding worship of other deities into the late 19th century  After the Protestant Reformation in the 1530s  a change led by Martin Luther s Swedish associate Olaus Petri  the authority of the Roman Catholic Church was abolished  The church and state were separated  allowing Lutheranism to prevail  This process was completed by the Uppsala Synod of 1593  Lutheranism became Sweden s official religion  During the era following the Reformation  usually known as the period of Lutheran Orthodoxy  small groups of non Lutherans  especially Calvinist Dutchmen  the Moravian Church and Walloons or French Huguenots from Belgium  played a significant role in trade and industry  and were quietly tolerated as long as they kept a low religious profile  The Sami originally had their own shamanistic religion  but they converted to Lutheranism by the work of Swedish missionaries in the 17th and 18th centuries  Uppsala Cathedral With religious liberalizations in the late 18th century believers of other faiths  including Judaism and Roman Catholicism  were allowed to openly live and work in the country  However  until 1860 it remained illegal for Lutheran Swedes to convert to another religion  The 19th century saw the arrival of various evangelical free churches  and  towards the end of the century  secularism  leading many to distance themselves from Church rituals  Leaving the Church of Sweden became legal with the so called dissenter law of 1860  but only under the provision of entering another Christian denomination  The right to stand outside any religious denomination was formally established in the Law on Freedom of Religion in 1951  In 2000 the Church of Sweden was separated from the state and Sweden ceased to have any official church  Church of

Sweden  Lutheran   this number has been decreasing by about one percentage point a year for the last two decades  135  136  However  only approximately 2  of the church s members regularly attend Sunday services  137  The reason for the large number of inactive members is partly that until 1996  children automatically became members at birth if at least one of the parents was a member  Since 1996  only children that are christened become members  Some 275 000 Swedes are today members of various free churches  where congregation attendance is much higher   and  in addition  immigration has meant that there are now some 92 000 Roman Catholics and 100 000 Eastern Orthodox Christians living in Sweden  138  Because of immigration  Sweden also has a significant Muslim population  They number about 500 000  but only approximately 5   25 000  of these actively practice Islam  in the sense of attending Friday prayer and praying five times a day   139  Despite a high formal membership rate in the Church of Sweden  some studies have found Sweden to be one of the least religious countries in the world  with one of the highest levels of atheism  According to different studies  between 46  and 85  of Swedes do not believe in God  140  In the Eurostat survey  23  of Swedish citizens responded that  they believe there is a God   whereas 53  answered that  they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force  and 23  that  they do not believe there is any sort of spirit  God  or life force   Nevertheless  despite a lack of belief in God  these individuals resented the term atheist  and still called themselves Christians  being content with remaining in the Church of Sweden  141  Other research has shown that religion in Sweden continues to play a role in cultural identity  142  This is evidenced by the fact that around 80 percent of adults continue to remain members of the Lutheran Church despite having to pay a church tax  moreover  rates of baptism remain high and church weddings are increasing in Sweden  142  Health See also  Healthcare in Sweden and Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare Healthcare in Sweden is similar in quality to other developed nations

Programme for International Student Assessment  PISA   Swedish 15 year old pupils score close to the OECD average  143  After completing the 9th grade  about 90  of the students continue with a three year upper secondary school  gymnasium   which can lead to both a job qualification or entrance eligibility to university  The school system is largely financed by taxes  The Swedish government treats public and independent schools equally 144  by introducing education vouchers in 1992 as one of the first countries in the world after The Netherlands  Anyone can establish a for profit school and the municipality must pay new schools the same amount as municipal schools get  School lunch is free for all students in Sweden  and usually includes one or two different kinds of hot meals  a vegetarian meal  salad bar  fruit  bread  milk and water  Some schools  especially kindergartens and middle schools  even serve breakfast for free citation needed  to those who want to eat before school starts  There are a number of different universities and colleges in Sweden  the oldest and largest of which are situated in Uppsala  Lund  Gothenburg and Stockholm  Only a few countries such as Canada  the United States  Japan and South Korea have higher levels of tertiary education degree holders  citation needed  Along with several other European countries  the government also subsidises tuition of international students pursuing a degree at Swedish institutions  although a recent bill passed in the Swedish parliament will limit this subsidy to students from EEA countries and Switzerland  145  Immigration Main article  Immigration to Sweden Immigrants and emigrants  Sweden 1850 2007 Immigration has been a major source of population growth and cultural change throughout much of the history of Sweden  Sweden has been transformed from a nation of emigration ending after World War I to a nation of immigration from World War II onwards  The economic  social  and political aspects of immigration have caused controversy regarding ethnicity  economic benefits  jobs for non immigrants  settlement patterns  impact on upward social mobility  crime  and voting behaviour  According to Eurostat  in 2010  there were 1 33 million foreign born residents in Sweden  corresponding to 14 3  of the total population  Of these  859 000  9 2   were born outside the EU and 477 000  5 1   were

concentrated in the urban areas of Svealand and G taland  148  Since the early 1970s  immigration to Sweden has been mostly due to refugee migration and family reunification from countries in the Middle East  Africa and Latin America  150  The largest groups in 2010 were  148   Finland  172 218  Former Yugoslavia  152 268   Iraq  117 919   Poland  67 518   Iran  59 922   Germany  47 803

sexual revolution   with gender equality having particularly been promoted  151  At the present time  the number of single people is one of the highest in the world  The early Swedish film I Am Curious  Yellow   1967  reflected a liberal view of sexuality  including scenes of love making that caught international attention  and introduced the concept of the  Swedish sin   Sweden has also become very liberal towards homosexuality  as is reflected in the popular acceptance of films such as Show Me Love  which is about two young lesbians in the small Swedish town of  m l  Since 1 May 2009  Sweden repealed its  registered partnership  laws and fully replaced them with gender neutral marriage   152  Sweden also offers domestic partnerships for both same sex and opposite sex couples

Sweden Agnetha F ltskog of Swedish band ABBA performing in 1977  Sweden has a rich musical tradition  ranging from mediaeval folk ballads to hip hop music  The music of the pre Christian Norse has been lost to history  although historical re creations have been attempted based on instruments found in Viking sites  The instruments used were the lur  a sort of trumpet   simple string instruments  wooden flutes and drums  It is possible that the Viking musical legacy lives on in some of the old Swedish folk music  Sweden has a significant folk music scene  both in the traditional style as well as more modern interpretations which often mix in elements of rock and jazz  V sen is more of a traditionalist group  using a unique  traditional Swedish instrument called the nyckelharpa while Garmarna  Nordman and Hedningarna have more modern elements  There is also Sami music  called the joik  which is actually a type of chant which is part of the traditional Saami animistic spirituality but has gained recognition in the international world of folk music  Sweden s most classic and notable composers includes Carl Michael Bellman and Franz Berwald  Sweden also has a prominent choral music tradition  deriving in part from the cultural importance of Swedish folk songs  In fact  out of a population of 9 2 million  it is estimated that five to six hundred thousand people sing in choirs  154  In 2007  with over 800 million dollars in revenue  Sweden was the third largest music exporter in the world and surpassed only by the US and the UK  155  156  citation needed ABBA was one
