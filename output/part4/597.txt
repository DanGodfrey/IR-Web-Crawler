18th centuries  The American colonies went from marginally successful colonial economies to a small  independent farming economy  which in 1776 became the United States of America  In 180 years the United States grew to a huge  integrated  industrialized economy that still makes up over a quarter of the world economy citation needed   The main causes were a large unified market  a supportive political legal system  vast areas of highly productive farmlands  vast natural resources  especially timber  coal and oil   a cultural landscape that valued entrepreneurship  a commitment to investing in material and human capital  and at times a willingness to exploit labor  In addition  the U S  was able to utilize these resources due to a unique set of institutions designed to encourage utilization and extraction  citation needed  As a result  the U S  s GDP per capita converged on and eventually surpassed that of the U K   as well as other nations that it previously trailed economically  The economy has maintained high wages  attracting immigrants by the millions from all over the world  23  In the 19th century  recessions frequently coincided with financial crises  The Panic of 1837 was followed by a five year depression  with the failure of banks and then record high unemployment levels  24  Because of the great changes in the economy over the centuries  it is difficult to compare the severity of modern recessions to early recessions  25  Recessions after World War II appear to have been less severe than earlier recessions  but the reasons for this are unclear  26  The Depression of 1893 was one of the worst in American history  with the unemployment rate exceeding 10  for half a decade  27   edit  World s largest economy The United States has been the world s largest national economy since at least the 1890s  13  The Empire State Building  completed in 1931 at the beginning of the Great Depression  remained the world s tallest building for decades  For many years following the Great Depression of the 1930s  when danger of recession appeared most serious  the government sought to strengthen the economy by spending heavily itself or cutting taxes so that consumers would spend more  and by fostering rapid growth in the money supply  which also encouraged more spending  Ideas about the best tools for stabilizing the economy changed substantially between the 1930s and the 1980s  From the New Deal era that began in 1933  to the Great Society initiatives of the 1960s  national policy makers relied principally on fiscal policy to influence the economy  The approach  advanced by British economist John Maynard Keynes  gave elected officials a leading role in directing the economy  since spending and taxes are controlled by the U S  President and the Congress  The  Baby Boom  saw a dramatic increase in fertility in the period 1942 1957  it was caused by delayed marriages and childbearing during depression years  a surge in prosperity  a demand for suburban single family homes  as opposed to inner city apartments  and new optimism about the future  The boom crested about 1957  then slowly declined  28  A period of high inflation  interest rates and unemployment after 1973 weakened confidence in fiscal policy as a tool for regulating the overall pace of economic activity  29  The  Baby Boom  saw a dramatic increase in fertility in the period 1942 1957  it was caused by delayed marriages and childbearing during depression years  a surge in prosperity  a demand for suburban single family homes  as opposed to inner city apartments  and new optimism about the future  The boom crested about 1957  then slowly declined  28  The U S  economy grew by an average of 3 8  from 1946 to 1973  while real median household income surged 74   or 2 1  a year   30  31  The economy since 1973  however  has been characterized by both slower growth  averaging 2 7    and nearly stagnant living standards  with household incomes increasing by 10   or only 0 3  annually  32  The worst recession in recent decades  in terms of lost output  occurred during the 2008 financial crisis  when GDP fell by 5 0  from the spring of 2008 to the spring of 2009  Other significant recessions took place in 1957 58  when GDP fell 3 7   following the 1973 oil crisis  with a 3 1  fall from late 1973 to early 1975  and in the 1981 82 recession  when GDP dropped by 2 9   33  34  Recent  mild recessions have included the 1990 91 downturn  when output fell by 1 3   and the 2001 recession  in which GDP slid by 0 3   the 2001 downturn lasted just eight months  34  The most vigorous  sustained periods of growth  on the other hand  took place from early 1961 to mid 1969  with an expansion of 53   5 1  a year   from mid 1991 to late in 2000  at 43   3 8  a year   and from late 1982 to mid 1990  at 37   4  a year   33  In the 1970s and 1980s  it was popular in the U S  to believe that Japan s economy would outgrow the United States  but the predictions failed  35   edit  Emerging countries catch up with the U S  Since the 1970s emerging countries have caught up with rich countries  These countries are learning to produce the same products and services that previously only the U S  and a few other countries could produce  The People s Republic of China is bypassing the United States as the world s largest economy  36  Meanwhile real income growth in North America  Europe and Japan has been slower than previously  Since 1976  the US has sustained trade deficits with other nations  and since 1982  current account deficits  the nation s long standing surplus in its trade in services was maintained  however  and reached US 140 billion yearly in 2008 and 2009  In recent years  the primary economic concerns have centered on  high household debt   11 trillion  including  2 5 trillion in revolving debt   37  high net national debt   9 trillion   high corporate debt   9 trillion   high mortgage debt  over  15

economy had its lowest saving rate since 1933  40  These issues have raised concerns among economists and national politicians  41  The United States economy experienced a crisis in 2008 led by a derivatives market and subprime mortgage crisis  and a declining dollar value  42  On December 1  2008  the NBER declared that the United States entered a recession in December 2007  citing employment and production figures as well as the third quarter decline in GDP  43  The recession did  however  lead to a reduction in record trade deficits  which fell from  840 billion annually during the 2006 08 period  to  500 billion in 2009  33  44  as well as to higher personal savings rates  which jumped from a historic low of 1  in early 2008  to nearly 5  in late 2009  The merchandise trade deficit rose to  670 billion in 2010  savings rates  however  remained at around 5   45  In 1994  the North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA created the largest trade bloc in the world  In 1980  the U S  public debt was  909 billion   or an amount equal to 33 3  of America s gross domestic product  GDP   By 1990  that number had more than tripled to  3 2 trillion   or 55 9  of GDP  46  In 2001 the national debt was  5 7 trillion  however  the debt to GDP ratio remained at 1990 levels  47  Debt levels rose quickly in the following decade  and on January 28  2010  the US debt ceiling was raised to  14 3 trillion dollars  48  Based on the 2010 U S  budget  total national debt will grow to nearly 100  of GDP  versus a level of approximately 80  in early 2009  49  The White House estimates that the government s tab for servicing the debt will exceed  700 billion a year in 2019  50  up from  202 billion in 2009  51  The U S  Treasury statistics indicate that  at the end of 2006  non US citizens and institutions held 44  of federal debt held by the public  52  China  holding  801 5 billion in treasury bonds  is the largest foreign financier of the record U S  public debt  53  US

S  economy is the economic freedom afforded to the private sector by allowing the private sector to make the majority of economic decisions in determining the direction and scale of what the U S  economy produces  54  This is enhanced by relatively low levels of regulation and government involvement  55  as well as a court system that generally protects property rights and enforces contracts  Today  the United States is home to 29 6 million small businesses  30  of the world s millionaires  40  of the world s billionaires  as well as 139 of the world s 500 largest companies  15  56  57  58  From its emergence as an independent nation  the United States has encouraged science and innovation  As a result  the United States has been the birthplace of 161 of Britannica s 321 Great Inventions  including items such as the airplane  internet  microchip  laser  cellphone  refrigerator  email  microwave  LCD and LED technology  air conditioning  assembly line  supermarket  bar code  electric motor  and ATM  59  The United States is rich in mineral resources and fertile farm soil  and it is fortunate to have a moderate climate  It also has extensive coastlines on both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans  as well as on the Gulf of Mexico  Rivers flow from far within the continent and the Great Lakes five large  inland lakes along the U S  border with Canada provide additional shipping access  These extensive waterways have helped shape the country s economic growth over the years and helped bind America s 50 individual states together in a single economic unit  60  The number of workers and  more importantly  their productivity help determine the health of the U S  economy  Throughout its history  the United States has experienced steady growth in the labor force  a phenomenon that is both cause and effect of almost constant economic expansion  Until shortly after World War I  most workers were immigrants from Europe  their immediate descendants  or African Americans who were mostly slaves taken from Africa  or slave descendants  61  Beginning in the late 20th century  many Latin Americans immigrated  followed by large numbers of Asians after the removal of nation origin based immigration quotas  62  The promise of high wages brings many highly skilled workers from around the world to the United States  Over 13 million people entered the United States during the 1990s alone  63  Labor mobility has also been important to the capacity of the American economy to adapt to changing conditions  citation needed  When immigrants flooded labor markets on the East Coast  many workers moved inland  often to farmland waiting to be tilled  Similarly  economic opportunities in industrial  northern cities attracted black Americans from southern farms in the first half of the 20th century  in what was known as the Great Migration  In the United States  the corporation has emerged as an association of owners  known as stockholders  who form a business enterprise governed by a complex set of rules and customs  Brought on by the process of mass production  corporations  such as General Electric  have been instrumental in shaping the United States  Through the stock market  American banks and investors have grown their economy by investing and withdrawing capital from profitable corporations  Today in the era of globalization  American investors and corporations have influence all over the world  The American government is also included among the major investors in the American economy  Government investments have been directed towards public works of scale  such as from the Hoover Dam   military industrial contracts  and the financial industry  While consumers and producers make most decisions that mold the economy  government has a powerful effect on the U S  economy in at least four areas  as the government uses a capitalist system  Strong government regulation in the U S  economy started in the early 1900s with the rise of the Progressive Movement  prior to this the government promoted economic growth through protective tariffs and subsidies to industry  built infrastructure  and established banking policies  including the gold standard  to encourage savings and investment in productive enterprises  citation needed  On June 26  2009  Jeff Immelt  the CEO of General Electric  called for the United States to increase its manufacturing base employment to 20  of the workforce  commenting that the U S  has outsourced too much in some areas and can no longer rely on the financial sector and consumer spending to drive demand  64   edit  Employment Main articles  Education in the United States  Immigration to the United States  and Unemployment in the United States There are 4 352 colleges  universities  and junior

degree rate is the tenth highest  In 2003 a Supreme Court decision concerning affirmative action in universities allowed educational institutions to consider race as a factor in admitting students  66  The labor market in the United States has attracted immigrants from all over the world and its net migration rate is among the highest in the world  For example  the brain drain from Europe to the United States means that some 400 000 European science and technology graduates now live in the U S  67  Nearly 14 million immigrants came to the United States from 2000 to 2010  68  More than 40 percent of the 2010 Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children  They founded seven of the ten most valuable brands in the world  69  70  United States Labor Force Participation

reasons  and discouraged workers  was 15 9   79  In 2009 and 2010  following the financial crisis of 2007 2010  the emerging problem of jobless recoveries resulted in record levels of long term unemployment with over 6 million workers looking for work longer than 6 months as of January  2010  This particularly affected older workers  39  Since the recession s end in June 2009 in the United States  immigrants have gained 656 000 jobs  while U S  born workers lost more than a million jobs  80  In April 2010  the official unemployment rate was 9 9   but the government s broader U 6

and Federal Reserve System United States historical inflation rate 1666 2004 The United States dollar is the unit of currency of the United States  The U S  dollar is the currency most used in international transactions  140  Several countries use it as their official currency  and in many others it is the de facto currency  141  The federal government attempts to use both monetary policy  control of the money supply through mechanisms such as changes in interest rates  and fiscal policy  taxes and spending  to maintain low inflation  high economic growth  and low unemployment  A relatively private central bank  known as the Federal Reserve  was formed in 1913 to provide a stable currency and monetary policy  Despite significant loss of value due to inflation  1   the U S  dollar has been regarded as one of the more stable currencies in the world and many nations back their own currency with U S  dollar reserves  The U S  dollar has maintained its position as the world s primary reserve currency  although it is gradually being challenged in that role  142  Almost two thirds of currency reserves held around the world are held in US dollars  compared to around 25  for the next most popular currency  the Euro  143  Rising US national debt  2  and the related rise of China have led to some  especially the Chinese  to call for replacing the dollar as the world s reserved currency  but thus far this has been only speculation  144  The dollar used gold standard and or silver standard from 1785 until 1971  when it became a floating fiat currency because of problems experienced with attempting to fix prices of commodities   edit  Law and government The United States is among the best ranking economies in indices such as the Ease of Doing Business Index  Economic Freedom of the World  Index of Economic Freedom  and Global Enabling Trade Report   edit  Regulations The U S  federal government regulates private enterprise in numerous ways  Regulation falls into two general categories  Some efforts seek  either directly or indirectly  to control prices  Traditionally  the government has sought to create state regulated monopolies such as electric utilities from while allowing prices in the level that would ensure them normal profits  At times  the government has extended economic control to other kinds of industries as well  In the years following the Great Depression  it devised a complex system to stabilize prices for agricultural goods  which tend to fluctuate wildly in response to rapidly changing supply and demand  A number of other industries trucking and  later  airlines successfully sought regulation themselves to limit what they considered as harmful price cutting  a process called regulatory capture  145  Another form of economic regulation  antitrust law  seeks to strengthen market forces so that direct regulation is unnecessary  The government and  sometimes  private parties have used antitrust law to prohibit practices or mergers that would unduly limit competition  145  Bank regulation in the United States is highly fragmented compared to other G10 countries where most countries have only one bank regulator  In the U S   banking is regulated at both the federal and state level  The U S also has one of the most highly regulated banking environments in the world  however  many of the regulations are not safety and soundness related  but are instead focused on privacy  disclosure  fraud prevention  anti money laundering  anti terrorism  anti usury lending  and promoting lending to lower income segments  citation needed  Revenue and Expense as   GDP  Deficit and debt increases 2001 2009  Since the 1970s  government has also exercised control over private companies to achieve social goals  such as improving the public s health and safety or maintaining a healthy environment  For example  the Occupational Safety and Health Administration provides and enforces standards for workplace safety  and the United States Environmental Protection Agency provides standards and regulations to maintain air  water  and land resources  The U S  Food and Drug Administration regulates what drugs may reach the market  and also provides standards of disclosure for food products  145  American attitudes about regulation changed substantially during the final three decades of the 20th century  Beginning in the 1970s  policy makers grew increasingly convinced that economic regulation protected companies at the expense of consumers in industries such as airlines and trucking  At the same time  technological changes spawned new competitors in some industries  such as telecommunications  that once were considered natural monopolies  Both developments led to a succession of laws easing regulation  145  While leaders of America s two most influential political parties generally favored economic deregulation during the 1970s  1980s  and 1990s  there was less agreement concerning regulations designed to achieve social goals  Social regulation had assumed growing importance in the years following the Depression and World War II  and again in the 1960s and 1970s  During the 1980s  the government relaxed labor  consumer and environmental rules based on the idea that such regulation interfered with free enterprise  increased the costs of doing business  and thus contributed to inflation  The response to such changes is mixed  many Americans continued to voice concerns about specific events or trends  prompting the government to issue new regulations in some areas  including environmental protection  145  Where legislative channels have been unresponsive  some citizens have turned to the courts to address social issues more quickly  For instance  in the 1990s  individuals  and eventually the government itself  sued tobacco companies over the health risks of cigarette smoking  The 1998 Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement provided states with long term payments to cover medical costs to treat smoking related illnesses  145  Between 2000 and 2008  economic regulation in the United States saw the most rapid expansion since the early 1970s  146  The number of new pages in the Federal Registry  a proxy for economic regulation  rose from 64 438 new pages in 2001 to 78 090 in new pages in 2007  a record amount of regulation  146  Economically significant regulations  defined as regulations which cost more than  100 million a year  increased by 70   146  Spending on regulation increased by 62  from  26 4 billion to  42 7 billion  146   edit  Taxation Main article  Taxation in the United States Taxation in the United States is a complex system which may involve payment to at least four different levels of government and many methods of taxation  Taxes are levied by the federal government  by the state governments  and often by local governments  which may include counties  municipalities  township  school districts  and other special purpose districts  which include fire  utility  and transit districts  Forms of taxation include taxes on income  property  sales  imports  payroll  estates and gifts  as well as various fees  When taxation by all government levels taken into consideration  the total taxation as percentage of GDP was approximately a quarter of GDP in 2011  147  Share of black market in the U S  economy is very low compared to other countries  148   edit  Expenditure Main articles  United States federal budget and United States public debt Fiscal Year 2011 U S  Federal Spending   Cash or Budget Basis  Fiscal Year 2011 U S  Federal Receipts  The United States public sector spending amounts to about one third of the GDP  Each level of government provides many direct services  The federal government  for example  is responsible for national defense  backs research that often leads to the development of new products  conducts space exploration  and runs numerous programs designed to help workers develop workplace skills and find jobs  including higher education   Government spending has a significant effect on local and regional economies and even on the overall pace of economic activity  citation needed  State governments  meanwhile  are responsible for the construction and maintenance of most highways  State  county  or city governments play the leading role in financing and operating public schools  Local governments are primarily responsible for police and fire protection  citation needed  The welfare system in the United States began in the 1930s  during the Great Depression  After the Great Society legislation of the 1960s  for the first time a person who was not elderly or disabled could receive a living from the American government  149  Overall  federal  state  and local spending accounted for almost 28  of gross domestic product in 1998  150  As of January 20  2009  the total U S  federal debt was  10 627 trillion  151  The borrowing cap debt ceiling as of 2005 stood at  8 18 trillion  152  In March 2006  Congress raised that ceiling an additional  0 79 trillion to  8 97 trillion  which is approximately 68  of GDP  153  Congress has used this method to deal with an encroaching debt ceiling in previous years  as the federal borrowing limit was raised in 2002 and 2003  154  As of October 4  2008  the  Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008  raised the current debt ceiling to US  11 3 trillion  155  The federal government s debt rose by almost  1 4 trillion in 2009  and now stands at  12 1 trillion  156  While the U S  public debt is the world s largest in absolute size  another measure is its size relative to the nation s GDP  As of 2009 the debt was 83 percent of GDP  This debt  as a percent of GDP  is still less than the debt of Japan  192    the overwhelming number of owners of JGBs are Japanese  157  and roughly equivalent to those of a few western European nations  158   edit  See also Wikimedia Commons has media
