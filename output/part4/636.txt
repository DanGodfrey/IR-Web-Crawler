Environmental movement in the United States From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search 1970s U S  postage stamp block In the United States today  the organized environmental movement is represented by a wide range of organizations sometimes called non governmental organizations or NGOs  These organizations exist on local  national  and international scales  Environmental NGOs vary widely in political views and in the amount they seek to influence the environmental policy of the United States and other governments  The environmental movement today consists of both large national groups and also many smaller local groups with local concerns  Some resemble the old U S  conservation movement   whose modern expression is the Nature Conservancy  Audubon Society and National Geographic Society   American organizations with a worldwide influence  Contents 1 Scope of the movement 2 History 2 1 Conservation movement 2 2 Progressive era 2 3 New Deal 2 4 Post 1945 2 4

United States  according to Andrew Rowell are the so called Group of Ten  Defenders of Wildlife  Environmental Defense Fund  National Audubon Society  National Wildlife Federation  Natural Resources Defense Council  Friends of the Earth  Izaak Walton League  Sierra Club  The Wilderness Society and the World Wide Fund for Nature 1  The early Conservation movement  which began in the late 19th century  included fisheries and wildlife management  water  soil conservation and sustainable forestry  Today it includes sustainable yield of natural resources  preservation of wilderness areas and biodiversity The modern Environmental movement  which began in the 1960s with concern about air and water pollution  became broader in scope to including all landscapes and human activities  See List of environmental issues  Environmental health movement dating at least to Progressive Era  1890s   1920s  urban reforms including clean water supply  more efficient removal of raw sewage and reduction in crowded and unsanitary living conditions  Today Environmental health is more related to nutrition  preventive medicine  aging well and other concerns specific to the human body s well being  Sustainability movement which started in the 1980s focused on Gaia theory  value of Earth and other interrelations between human sciences and human responsibilities  Its spinoff Deep Ecology was more spiritual but often claimed to be science  Environmental justice is a movement that began in the U S  in the 1980s and seeks an end to environmental racism  Often  low income and minority communities are located close to highways  garbage dumps  and factories  where they are exposed to greater pollution and environmental health risk than the rest of the population  The Environmental Justice movement seeks to link  social  and  ecological  environmental concerns  while at the same time keeping environmentalists conscious of the dynamics in their own movement  i e  racism  sexism  homophobia  classicism  and other malaises of dominant culture  As public awareness and the environmental sciences have improved in recent years  environmental issues have broadened to include key concepts such as  sustainability  and also new emerging concerns such as ozone depletion  global warming  acid rain  land use and biogenetic pollution  Environmental movements often interact or are linked with other social movements  e g  for peace  human rights  and animal rights  and against nuclear weapons and or nuclear power  endemic diseases  poverty  hunger  etc  Some US colleges are now going green by signing the  President s Climate Commitment   a document that a college President can sign to enable said colleges to practice environmentalism by switching to solar power  etc  2   edit  History Early European settlers to the United States brought from Europe the concept of the commons  In the colonial era  access to natural resources was allocated by individual towns  disputes over fisheries or land use were resolved at the local level  Changing technologies however  strained traditional ways of resolving disputes of resource use and local governments had limited control over powerful special interests  For example the damming of rivers for mills cut off upriver towns from fisheries  Logging and clearing of forest in watersheds harmed local fisheries downstream  In New England many farmers became uneasy as they noticed clearing of forest changed stream flows and a decrease in bird population which helped control insects pests  These concerns become widely known with the publication of Man and Nature  1864  by George Perkins Marsh  The environmental impact method of analysis is generally the main mode for determining what issues the environmental movement is involved in  Contrary to critics beliefs this model is used to determine how to proceed in situations that are detrimental to the environment in the way that is least damaging and has the fewest lasting implications  3   edit  Conservation movement Conservation first became a national issue during the progressive era s conservation movement  1890s   1920s   The early national conservation movement shifted emphasis to scientific management which favored larger enterprises and control began to shift from local governments to the states and the federal government  Judd  Some writers credit sportsman  hunters and fisherman with the increasing influence of the conservation movement  In the 1870s sportsman magazines such as American Sportsmen  Forest and Stream  and Field and Stream are seen as leading to the growth of the conservation movement  Reiger  This conservation movement also urged the establishment of state and national parks and forests  wildlife refuges  and national monuments intended to preserve noteworthy natural features  Conservation groups focus primarily on an issue that s origins are routed in general expansion  As Industrialization became more prominent as well as the increasing trend towards Urbanization the conservative environmental movement began  Contrary to popular belief conservation groups are not against expansion in general  instead they are concerned with efficiency with resources and land development  3   edit  Progressive era Theodore Roosevelt was a prominent conservationist  putting the issue high on the national agenda  4  He worked with all the major figures of the movement  especially his chief advisor on the matter  Gifford Pinchot  Roosevelt was deeply committed to conserving natural resources  and is considered to be the nation s first conservation President  He encouraged the Newlands Reclamation Act of 1902 to promote federal construction of dams to irrigate small farms and placed 230 million acres  360 000 mi  or 930 000 km   under federal protection  Roosevelt set aside more Federal land for national parks and nature preserves than all of his predecessors combined  5  Roosevelt established the United States Forest Service  signed into law the creation of five National Parks  and signed the 1906 Antiquities Act  under which he proclaimed 18 new U S  National Monuments  He also established the first 51 Bird Reserves  four Game Preserves  and 150 National Forests  including Shoshone National Forest  the nation s first  The area of the United States that he placed under public protection totals approximately 230 000 000 acres  930 000 km2   Gifford Pinchot had been appointed by McKinley as chief of Division of Forestry in the Department of Agriculture  In 1905  his department gained control of the national forest reserves  Pinchot promoted private use  for a fee  under federal supervision  In 1907  Roosevelt designated 16 million acres  65 000 km   of new national forests just minutes before a deadline  In May 1908  Roosevelt sponsored the Conference of Governors held in the White House  with a focus on natural resources and their most efficient use  Roosevelt delivered the opening address   Conservation as a National Duty   In 1903 Roosevelt toured the Yosemite Valley with John Muir  who had a very different view of conservation  and tried to minimize commercial use of water resources and forests  Working through the Sierra Club he founded  Muir succeeded in 1905 in having Congress transfer the Mariposa Grove and Yosemite Valley to the National Park Service  While Muir wanted nature preserved for the sake of pure beauty  Roosevelt subscribed to Pinchot s formulation   to make the forest produce the largest amount of whatever crop or service will be most useful  and keep on producing it for generation after generation of men and trees    6  Muir and the Sierra Club vehemently opposed the damning of the Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite in order to provide water to the city of San Francisco  Roosevelt and Pinchot supported the dam  as did President Woodrow Wilson  The Hetch Hetchy dam was finished in 1923 and is still in operation  but the Sierra Club still wants to tear it down  7  Other influential conservationists of the Progressive Era included George Bird Grinnell  a prominent sportsmen who founded the Boone and Crockett Club   the Izaak Walton League and John Muir  the founder of the Sierra Club in 1892  Conservationists organized the National Parks Conservation Association  the Audubon Society  and other groups that still remain active   edit  New Deal Franklin Delano Roosevelt  1933 45   like his cousin Theodore Roosevelt  was an ardent conservationist  He used numerous programs of the departments of Agriculture and Interior 8  to end wasteful land use  mitigate the effects of the Dust Bowl  and efficiently develop natural resources in the West  9  One of the most popular of all New Deal programs was the Civilian Conservation Corps  1933 1943   which sent two million poor young men to work in rural and wilderness areas  primarily on conservation projects  10   edit  Post 1945 After World War II increasing encroachment on wilderness land evoked the continued resistance of conservationists  who succeeded in blocking a number of projects in the 1950s and 1960s  including the proposed Bridge Canyon Dam that would have backed up the waters of the Colorado River into the Grand Canyon National Park  The Inter American Conference on the Conservation of Renewable Natural Resources met in 1948 as a collection of nearly 200 scientists from all over the Americans forming the trusteeship principle that   No generation can exclusively own the renewable resources by which it lives  We hold the commonwealth in trust for prosperity  and to lessen or destroy it is to commit treason against the future  11   Sound familiar  Look at the definition from the Brundtland Commission of sustainable development in 1987    edit  Beginning of the modern movement Earth Day Flag During the 1950s  1960s and 1970s  several events occurred which raised the public awareness of harm to the environment caused by man  In 1954  the 23 man crew of the Japanese fishing vessel Lucky Dragon was exposed to radioactive fallout from a hydrogen bomb test at Bikini Atoll  in 1969  an ecologically catastrophic oil spill from an offshore well in California s Santa Barbara Channel  Barry Commoner s protest against nuclear testing  Rachel Carson s book Silent Spring  Paul R  Ehrlich s The Population Bomb all added anxiety about the environment  Pictures of Earth from space emphasized that the earth was small and fragile  As the public became more aware of environmental issues  concern about air pollution  water pollution  solid waste disposal  dwindling energy resources  radiation  pesticide poisoning  particularly as described in Rachel Carson s influential Silent Spring  1962   noise pollution  and other environmental problems engaged a broadening number of sympathizers  That public support for environmental concerns was widespread became clear in the Earth Day demonstrations of 1970  Unlike the Progressive Era s conservation movement  1890s   1920s   which was largely elitist consisting of largely of wealthy  political powerful men the modern environmental movement was a social movement with more popular support  The environmental movement borrowed tactics from both the successful civil rights movement and the protests against the Vietnam war   edit  Wilderness preservation In the modern wilderness preservation movement  important philosophical roles are played by the writings of John Muir who had been activist in the late 19th and early 20th century  Along with Muir perhaps most influential in the modern movement is Henry David Thoreau who published Walden in 1854  Also important was forester and ecologist Aldo Leopold  one of the founders of the Wilderness Society in 1935  who wrote a classic of nature observation and ethical philosophy  A Sand County Almanac  published in 1949  Other philosophical foundations were established by Ralph Waldo Emerson and Thomas Jefferson   edit  Anti nuclear movement Main article  Anti nuclear movement in the United States The anti nuclear movement in the United States consists of more than 80 anti nuclear groups which have acted to oppose nuclear power or nuclear weapons  or both  in the United States  These groups include the Abalone Alliance  Clamshell Alliance  Institute for Energy and Environmental Research  Nuclear Information and Resource Service  and Physicians for Social Responsibility  The anti nuclear movement has delayed construction or halted commitments to build some new nuclear plants  12  and has pressured the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to enforce and strengthen the safety regulations for nuclear power plants  13  Anti nuclear protests reached a peak in the 1970s and 1980s and grew out of the environmental movement  14  Campaigns which captured national public attention involved the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant  Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant  Diablo Canyon Power Plant  Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant  and Three Mile Island  12  On June 12  1982  one million people demonstrated in New York City s Central Park against nuclear weapons and for an end to the cold war arms race  It was the largest anti nuclear protest and the largest political demonstration in American history  15  16  International Day of Nuclear Disarmament protests were held on June 20  1983 at 50 sites across the United States  17  18  There were many Nevada Desert Experience protests and peace camps at the Nevada Test Site during the 1980s and 1990s  19  20  More recent campaigning by anti nuclear groups has related to several nuclear power plants including the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Power Plant  21  22 Indian Point Energy Center  23 Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station  24 Pilgrim Nuclear Generating Station  25 Salem Nuclear Power Plant  26  and Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant  27  There have also been campaigns relating to the Y 12 Nuclear Weapons Plant  28  the Idaho National Laboratory  29  proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository  30  the Hanford Site  the Nevada Test Site  31 Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory  32  and transportation of nuclear waste from the Los Alamos National Laboratory  33  Some scientists and engineers have expressed reservations about nuclear power  including  Barry Commoner  S  David Freeman  John Gofman  Arnold Gundersen  Mark Z  Jacobson  Amory Lovins  Arjun Makhijani  Gregory Minor  Joseph Romm and Benjamin K  Sovacool  Scientists who have opposed nuclear weapons include Linus Pauling and Eugene Rabinowitch   edit  Antitoxin groups Antitoxin groups are a subgroup that is affiliated with the Environmental Movement in the United States  that is primarily concerned with the effects that cities and their by products have on humans  This aspect of the movement is a self proclaimed  movement of housewives   3  Concern around the issues of ground water contamination and air pollution rose in the early 1980s and individuals involved in antitoxic groups claim that they are concerned for the health of their families  3  A prominent case can be seen in the Love Canal Homeowner s association  LCHA   in this case a housing development was built on a site that had been used for toxic dumping by the Hooker Chemical Company  As a result of this dumping the residents had symptoms of skin irritation  Lois Gibbs  a resident of the development  started a grass routes campaign for reparations  Eventual success led to the government having to buy back homes that were sold in the development  3   edit  Federal legislation in the 1970s Prior to the 1970s the protection of basic air and water supplies was a matter mainly left to each state  During the  70s  responsibility for clean air and water to shifted to the federal government  Growing concerns  both environmental and economic  from cites and towns as well as sportsman and other local groups senators such as Maine s Edmund S  Muskie generated extensive legislation  notably the Clean Air Act of 1970  Other legislation included National Environmental Policy Act  NEPA   signed into law in 1970  which established a United States Environmental Protection Agency and a Council on Environmental Quality    the Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972  the Endangered Species Act of 1973  the Safe Drinking Water Act  1974   the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act  1976   the Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1977  which became known as the Clean Water Act  and the Comprehensive Environmental Response  Compensation  and Liability Act  commonly known as the Superfund Act  1980   These laws regulated toxic substances  pesticides  and ocean dumping  and protected wildlife  wilderness  and wild and scenic rivers  Moreover  the new laws provide for pollution research  standard setting  monitoring  and enforcement  The creation of these laws led to a major shift in the environmental movement  Groups such as the Sierra Club shifted focus from local issues to becoming a lobby in Washington and new groups  for example  the Natural Resources Defense Council and Environmental Defense  arose to influence politics as well   Larson   edit  Renewed focus on local action In the 1980s President Ronald Reagan sought to curtail scope of environmental protection taking steps such as appointing James G  Watt who was called one of the most  blatantly anti environmental political appointees   The major environmental groups responded with mass mailings which led to increased membership and donations  The large environmental organization increasingly relied on ties within Washington DC to advance their environmental agenda  At the same time membership in environmental groups became more suburban and urban  Groups such as animal rights  and the gun control lobby became linked with environmentalism while sportsman  farmers and ranchers were no longer influential in the movement  When industry groups lobbied to weaken regulation and a backlash against environmental regulations  the so called wise use movement gained importance and influence  The wise use movement and anti environmental groups were able to portray environmentalist as out of touch with main stream values   Larson   edit   Post environmentalism  In 2004  with the environmental movement seemingly stalled  some environmentalists started questioning whether  environmentalism  was even a useful political framework  According to a controversial essay titled  The Death of Environmentalism    Michael Shellenberger and Ted Nordhaus  2004  American environmentalism has been remarkably successful in protecting the air  water  and large stretches of wilderness in North America and Europe  but these environmentalists have stagnated as a vital force for cultural and political change  Shellenberger and Nordhaus wrote   Today environmentalism is just another special interest  Evidence for this can be found in its concepts  its proposals  and its reasoning  What stands out is how arbitrary environmental leaders are about what gets counted and what doesn t as  environmental   Most of the movement s leading thinkers  funders  and advocates do not question their most basic assumptions about who we are  what we stand for  and what it is that we should be doing   Their essay was followed by a speech in San Francisco called  Is Environmentalism Dead   by former Sierra Club President  Adam Werbach  who argued for the evolution of environmentalism into a more expansive  relevant and powerful progressive politics  Werbach endorsed building an environmental movement that is more relevant to average Americans  and controversially chose to lead Wal Mart s effort to take sustainability mainstream  These  post environmental movement  thinkers argue that the ecological crises the human species faces in the 21st century are qualitatively different from the problems the environmental movement was created to address in the 1960s and 1970s  Climate change and habitat destruction  they argue  are global  more complex  and demand far deeper transformations of the economy  the culture and political life  The consequence of environmentalism s outdated and arbitrary definition  they argue  is political irrelevancy  These  politically neutral  groups tend to avoid global conflicts and view the settlement of inter human conflict as separate from regard for nature   in direct contradiction to the ecology movement and peace movement which have increasingly close links  While Green Parties and Greenpeace  and groups like the ACTivist Magazine for example  regard ecology  biodiversity and an end to non human extinction as absolutely basic to peace  the local groups may not  and may see a high degree of global competition and conflict as justifiable if it lets them preserve their own local uniqueness  This seems selfish to some  However  such groups tend not to  burn out  and to sustain for long periods  even generations  protecting the same local treasures  The Water Keepers Alliance is a good example of such a group that sticks to local questions  Local groups increasingly find that they benefit from collaboration  e g  on consensus decision making methods  or making simultaneous policy  or relying on common legal resources  or even sometimes a common glossary  However  the differences between the various groups that make up the modern environmental movement tend to outweigh such similarities  and they rarely co operate directly except on a few major global questions  In a notable exception  over 1 000 local groups from around the country united for a single day of action as part of the Step It Up 2007 campaign for real solutions to global warming  Groups such as The Bioregional Revolution are calling on the need to bridge these differences  as the converging problems of the 21st century they claim compel us to unite and to take decisive action  They promote bioregionalism  permaculture  and local economies as solutions to these problems  overpopulation  global warming  global epidemics  and water scarcity  but most notably to  peak oil   the prediction that we are likely to reach a maximum in global oil production which could spell drastic changes in many aspects of our everyday lives   edit  Environmental rights Many environmental lawsuits turn on the question of who has standing  are the legal issues limited to property owners  or does the general public have a right to intervene  Christopher D  Stone s 1972 essay   Should trees have standing   seriously addressed the question of whether natural objects themselves should have legal rights  including the right to participate in lawsuits  Stone suggested that there was nothing absurd in this view  and noted that many entities now regarded as having legal rights were  in the past  regarded as  things  that were regarded as legally rightless  for example  aliens  children and women  His essay is sometimes regarded as an example of the fallacy of hypostatization  One of the earliest lawsuits to establish that citizens may sue for environmental and aesthetic harms was Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v  Federal Power Commission  decided in 1965 by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals  The case helped halt the construction of a power plant on Storm King Mountain in New York State  See also United States environmental law and David Sive  an attorney who was involved in the case   edit  Role of science Conservation biology is an important and rapidly developing field  One way to avoid the stigma of an  ism  was to evolve early anti nuclear groups into the more scientific Green Parties  sprout new NGOs such as Greenpeace and Earth Action  and devoted groups to protecting global biodiversity and preventing global warming and climate change  But in the process  much of the emotional appeal  and many of the original aesthetic goals were lost  Nonetheless  these groups have well defined ethical and political views  backed by hard science   edit  Criticisms of the Environmental Movement Some people are skeptical of the environmental movement and feel that it is more deeply rooted in politics than science  Although there have been serious debates about climate change and effects of some pesticides and herbicides that mimic animal sex steroids  science has shown that some of the claims of environmentalists have credence  Claims made by environmentalists may be perceived as veiled attacks on industry and globalization rather than legitimate environmental concerns  Detractors note that a significant number of environmental theories and predictions have been inaccurate and suggest that the regulations recommended by environmentalists will more likely harm society rather than help nature   edit  DDT Main article  DDT Specific examples include when Rachel Carson  in her book Silent Spring  suggested that the pesticide DDT caused cancer and drastically harmed ecosystems  DDT is highly toxic to aquatic life  including crayfish  daphnids  sea shrimp and many species of fish  However  DDT might be useful in controlling malaria  Prominent novelist and Harvard Medical School graduate Michael Crichton appeared before the U S  Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works to address such concerns and recommended the employment of double blind experimentation in environmental research  Crichton suggested that because environmental issues are so political in nature  policy makers need neutral  conclusive data to base their decisions on  rather than conjecture and rhetoric  and double blind experiments are the most efficient way to achieve that aim  A consistent theme acknowledged by both supporters and critics  though more commonly vocalized by critics  of the environmental movement is that we know very little about the Earth we live in  Most fields of environmental studies are relatively new  and therefore what research we have is limited and does not date far enough back for us to completely understand long term environmental trends  This has led a number of environmentalists to support the use of the precautionary principle in policy making  which ultimately asserts that we don t know how certain actions may affect the environment  and because there is reason to believe they may cause more harm than good we should refrain from such actions   edit  Elitist In the December 1994 Wild Forest Review  Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St  Clair wrote  The mainstream environmental movement was elitist  highly paid  detached from the people  indifferent to the working class  and a firm ally of big government  The environmental movement is now accurately perceived as just another well financed and cynical special interest group  its rancid infrastructure supported by Democratic Party operatives and millions in grants from corporate foundations    edit  Wilderness myth Writer William Cronon criticizes the modern environmental movement for having a romantic idealizations of wilderness  Cronon writes  wilderness serves as the unexamined foundation on which so many of the quasi religious values of modern environmentalism rest   Cronon claims that  to the extent that we live in an urban industrial civilization but at the same time pretend to ourselves that our real home is in the wilderness  to just that extent we give ourselves permission to evade responsibility for the lives we actually lead   Similarly Michael Pollan has argued that the wilderness ethic leads people to dismiss areas whose wildness is less than absolute  In his book Second Nature  Pollan writes that  once a landscape is no longer  virgin  it is typically written off as fallen  lost to nature  irredeemable    edit  Debates within the movement Within the environmental movement an ideological debate has taken place between those with an ecocentric view point and an anthropocentric view point  The anthropocentric view has been seen as the conservationist approach to the environment with nature viewed  at least in part  as resource to be used by man  In contrast to the conservationist approach the ecocentric view  associated with John Muir  Henry David Thoreau and William Wordworth sometimes referred to as the preservationist movement  This approach sees nature in a more spiritual way  Many environmental historians consider the split between John Muir and Gifford Pinchot  During the preservation   conservation debate the term preservationist become to be seen as a pejorative term  While the ecocentric view focused on biodiversity and wilderness protection the anthropocentric view focus on urban pollution and social justice  Some environmental writers  for example William Cronon have criticized the ecocentric view as have a dualist view as man being separate from nature  Critics of the anthropocentric view point contend that the environmental movement has been taken over by so called leftist with an agenda beyond environmental protection  Several books after the middle of the 20th century contributed to the rise of American environmentalism  as distinct from the longer established conservation movement   especially among college and university students and the more literate public  One was the publication of the first textbook on ecology  Fundamentals of Ecology  by Eugene Odum and Howard Odum  in 1953  Another was the appearance of the best seller Silent Spring by Rachel Carson  in 1962  Her book brought about a whole new interpretation on pesticides by exposing their harmful effects in nature  From this book many began referring to Carson as the  mother of the environmental movement   Another influential development was a 1965 lawsuit  Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v  Federal Power Commission  opposing the construction of a power plant on Storm King Mountain  which is said to have given birth to modern United States environmental law  The wide popularity of The Whole Earth Catalogs  starting in 1968  was quite influential among the younger  hands on  activist generation of the 1960s and 1970s  Recently  in addition to opposing environmental degradation and protecting wilderness  an increased focus on coexisting with natural biodiversity has appeared  a strain that is apparent in the movement for sustainable agriculture and in the concept of Reconciliation Ecology   edit  Environmentalism and politics v t e Lobbying in the United States Topics Political action committee 527

Turkish Environmentalists became much more influential in American politics after the creation or strengthening of numerous U S  environmental laws  including the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act and the formation of the US Environmental Protection Agency  or EPA in 1970  These successes were followed by the enactment of a whole series of laws regulating waste  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act   toxic substances  Toxic Substances Control Act   pesticides  FIFRA  Federal Insecticide  Fungicide  and Rodenticide Act   clean up of polluted sites  Superfund   protection of endangered species  Endangered Species Act   and more  Fewer environmental laws have been passed in the last decade as corporations and other conservative interests have increased their influence over American politics  citation needed  Corporate cooperation against environmental lobbyists has been organized by the Wise Use group  citation needed  At the same time  many environmentalists have been turning toward other means of persuasion  such as working with business  community  and other partners to promote sustainable development  Much environmental activism is directed towards conservation  citation needed  as well as the prevention or elimination of pollution  However  conservation movements  ecology movements  peace movements  green parties  green  and eco anarchists often subscribe to very different ideologies  while supporting the same goals as those who call themselves  environmentalists   To outsiders  these groups or factions can appear to be indistinguishable  As human population and industrial activity continue to increase  environmentalists often find themselves in serious conflict with those who believe that human and industrial activities should not be overly regulated or restricted  such as some libertarians  Environmentalists often clash with others  particularly  corporate interests   over issues of the management of natural resources  like in the case of the atmosphere as a  carbon dump   the focus of climate change  and global warming controversy  They usually seek to protect commonly owned or unowned resources for future generations  Those who take issue with new untested technologies are more precisely known  especially in Europe  as political ecologists  They usually seek  in contrast  to preserve the integrity of existing ecologies and ecoregions  and in general are more pessimistic about human  management   citation needed   edit  Radical environmentalism Main article  Radical environmentalism While most environmentalists are mainstream and peaceful  a small minority are more radical in their approach  Adherents of radical environmentalism and ecological anarchism are involved in direct action campaigns to protect the environment  Some campaigns have employed controversial tactics including sabotage  blockades  and arson  while most use peaceful protests such as marches  tree sitting  and the like  There is substantial debate within the environmental movement as to the acceptability of these tactics  but almost all environmentalists condemn violent actions that can harm humans   edit  See also
