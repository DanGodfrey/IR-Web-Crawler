magazines  which did not fall under the Code  flourished from the mid 1960s through the early 1980s from a variety of publishers  Mainstream American color comic books experienced a horror resurgence

at least the 12th century Heian period Japanese scroll  Gaki Zoshi   or the scroll of hungry ghosts            1  2  3  and the 16th century Mixtec codices  3  In the early 20th century  pulp magazines developed the horror sub genre  weird menace   which featured sadistic villains and graphic scenes of torture and brutality  The first such title  Popular Publications  Dime Mystery  began as a straight crime fiction magazine but evolved by 1933 under the influence of Grand Guignol theater  4  Other publishers eventually joined in  though Popular dominated the field of with Dime Mystery

 possibly the first full length comic book horror story After the fledgling medium of comic books became established by the late 1930s  horror fiction elements began appearing in superhero stories  with vampires  misshapen creatures  mad scientists and other tropes that bore the influence of 1930s  Universal horror films and other sources  5  By the mid 1940s  some detective and crime comics had incorporated horror motifs such as spiders and eyeballs into their graphics  and occasionally featured stories adapted from the literary horror tales of Edgar Allan Poe or other writers  or stories from the pulps and radio programs  6  The single issue Harvey Comics anthologies Front Page Comic Book  1945   bearing a cover with a knife wielding  skeletal ghoul  7  and Strange Story  July 1946

dramas as Inner Sanctum  Suspense and The Whistler  9  As cultural historian David Hajdu notes  comic book horror    had its roots in the pulps  where narratives of young women assaulted by  weird menaces      had filled magazines such as Terror Tales and Horror Stories for years  Variations on gothic fright had also appeared in several comics   Suspense Comics  which began in 1943   Yellowjacket  which included eight horror stories  billed as  Tales of Terror   in its run of ten issues  beginning in 1944   and Eerie  which had one issue published in 1947   10   edit  Early

first continuing series horror comic   21  The first two issues  which included art by Fred Guardineer and others  featured horror stories of ghosts  werewolves  haunted houses  killer puppets and other supernatural beings and locales  The premiere included a seven page  abridged adaptation of Horace Walpole s seminal gothic novel The Castle of Otranto  by an unknown writer and artist Al Ulmer  20  Following the postwar crime comics vogue spearheaded by publisher Lev Gleason s Crime Does Not Pay  which by 1948 was selling over a million copies of a month  22  came romance comics  which by 1949 outsold all other genres  23  and horror comics  The same month in which Adventures into the Unknown premiered  the comic book company EC  which would become the most prominent horror comics publisher of the 1950s  published its first horror story   Zombie Terror   by an unknown writer and artist Johnny Craig  in the superhero comics Moon Girl  5 24  25  Almost simultaneously Trans World Publications issued its one and only comic  the one shot Mysterious Traveler Comics  1  Nov  1948   based on the Mutual Broadcasting Network s radio show of that name and including amid its crime and science fiction stories a reprint of the Edgar Allen Poe adaptation  The Tell Tale Heart   reprinted from Charlton Comics  Yellowjacket Comics  6  25  26  The floodgates began to open the following year with the first horror comic from the 1950s  most prolific horror comics publisher  Atlas Comics  the decade s forerunner of Marvel Comics  While horror had been an element in 1940s superhero stories from the original predecessor company  Timely Comics  through the war years   when zombies  vampires  werewolves  and even pythonmen were to be found working for the Nazis and the Japanese   21  the publisher entered the horror arena full tilt with Amazing Mysteries  32  May 1949   continuing the numbering of the defunct superhero series Sub Mariner Comics  followed by the superhero anthology Marvel Mystery Comics becoming the horror series Marvel Tales with  93  Aug  1949  and the final two issues of Captain America Comics becoming the mostly horror fiction Captain America s Weird Tales  74 75  Oct  1949  amp  Feb  1950    the latter of which did not contain Captain America at all  27  28  Harvey Comics followed suit with its costumed crimefighter comic Black Cat by reformatting it as the horror comic Black Cat Mystery with issue  30  Aug  1951   21  29   edit  EC Comics and the horror boom Main article  EC Comics Horror comics briefly flourished from this point until the industry s self imposed censorship board  the Comics Code Authority  was instituted in late 1954  The most influential and enduring horror comics anthologies of this period  beginning 1950  were the 91 issues of EC Comics  three series  The Haunt of Fear  The Vault of Horror and Crypt of Terror  renamed Tales from the Crypt  30  In 1947  publisher William Gaines had inherited what was then Educational Comics upon the death of his father  Maxwell Gaines  Three years later  Gaines and editor Al Feldstein introduced horror in two of the company s crime comics to test the waters  Finding them successful  the publisher quickly turned them and a Western series into EC s triumvirate of horror  Additionally  the superhero comic Moon Girl  which had become the romance comic A Moon     a Girl     A Romance  became the primarily science fiction anthology Weird Fantasy  31  For the next four years  sardonic horror hosts the Old Witch  the Vault Keeper and the Crypt Keeper introduced stories drawn by such top artists and soon to be famous newcomers as Johnny Craig  Reed Crandall  Jack Davis  Graham Ingels  who signed his work  Ghastly    Jack Kamen  Bernard Krigstein  Harvey Kurtzman  and Wally Wood  32  Feldstein did most of the early scripting  writing a story a day with twist endings and poetic justice taken to absurd extremes  EC s success immediately spawned a host of imitators  such as Ziff Davis  and P L  Publishing s Weird Adventures  33 St  John Publications  Weird Horrors  34 Key Publications  Weird Chills  Weird Mysteries and Weird Tales of the Future  35 Comic Media s Weird Terror  36  Ziff Davis  Weird Thrillers  37 Atlas Comics  Adventures into Weird Worlds  38  and Star Publications  Ghostly Weird Stories  39  Others included Quality Comics  Web of Evil  40 Ace Comics  Web of Mystery  41 Premier Magazines  Horror from the Tomb 42 Harvey Comics  Tomb of Terror and Witches Tales  43 Avon Comics   Witchcraft  44 Ajax Farrell Publications  Fantastic Fears  45 Fawcett Comics  Worlds of Fear  46 Charlton Comics  The Thing  47  and a slew from Atlas Comics  including Adventures into Terror  48 Menace  Journey into Mystery  and Strange Tales  From 1949 through comics cover dated March 1955  Atlas Comics released 399 issues of 18 horror titles  AGC released 123 issues of five horror titles  and Ace Comics  98 issues of five titles   each more than EC s output  30   edit  Backlash In the late 1940s  comic books   particularly crime comics 49    had become the target of mounting public criticism for their content and their potentially harmful effects on children  with  accusations from several fronts  that  charged comic books with contributing to the rising rates of juvenile delinquency   50  Many city and county ordinances had banned some publications  51  though these were effectively overturned with a March 29  1948  United States Supreme Court ruling that a 64 year old New York State law outlawing publications with  pictures and stories of deeds of bloodshed  lust or crime  was unconstitutional  52  Regardless  the uproar increased upon the publication of two articles   Horror in the Nursery   by Judith Crist  in the March 25  1948  issue Collier s Weekly  50  based upon the symposium  Psychopathology of Comic Books  held a week earlier 50  by psychiatrist 53 Fredric Wertham  and Wertham s own features  The Comics     Very Funny   in the May 29  1948  issue of The Saturday Review of Literature  54  and a March 19  1948 symposium called  Psychopathology of Comic Books  which stated that comic books were  abnormally sexually aggressive  and led to crime  55  In response to public pressure and bad press  an industry trade group  the Association of Comics Magazine Publishers  ACMP  was formed with the intent of prodding the industry to police itself  The Association proved ineffective as few publishers joined and those who did exercised little restraint over the content of their titles  56   edit  Seduction of the Innocent In 1954  Dr  Fredric Wertham published Seduction of the Innocent  a tome that claimed horror  crime and other comics were a direct cause of juvenile delinquency  Wertham asserted  largely based on undocumented anecdotes  that reading violent comic books encouraged violent behavior in children  56  Wertham painted a picture of a large and pervasive industry  shrouded in secrecy and masterminded by a few  that operated upon the innocent and defenseless minds of the young  He further suggested the industry strong armed vendors into accepting their publications and forced artists and writers into producing the content against their will  57  Wertham alleged comics stimulated deviant sexual behavior  He noted female breasts in comics protruded in a provocative way and special attention was lavished upon the female genital region  57  A cover by Matt Baker from Phantom Lady was reprinted in the book with the caption   Sexual stimulation by combining  headlights  with the sadist s dream of tying up a woman   56  Boys interviewed by Wertham said they used comic book images for masturbation purposes  and one young comics reader confessed he wanted to be a sex maniac  Wertham contended comics promoted homosexuality by pointing to the Batman Robin relationship and calling it a homosexual wish dream of two men living together  He observed that Robin was often pictured standing with his legs spread and the genital region evident  57  Most alarming  Wertham contended that comic books turned children into deceitful little beings  reading funny animal comics in front of their parents but turning to horror comics the moment their parents left the room  Wertham warned of suspicious stores and their clandestine back rooms where second hand comics of the worst sort were peddled to children  The language used evoked images of children prowling about gambling dens and whorehouses  and anxious parents felt helpless in the face of such a powerful force as the comics industry  Excerpts from the book were published in Ladies  Home Journal and Reader s Digest  lending respectability and credibility to Wertham s arguments  57  A 14 page portfolio of panels and covers from across the entire comic book industry displayed murder  torture and sexual titillation for the reader s consideration  The most widely discussed art was that from  Foul Play   a horror story from EC about a dishonest baseball player whose head and intestines are used by his teammates in a game  Seduction of the Innocent sparked a firestorm of controversy and created alarm in parents  teachers and others interested in the welfare of children  the concerned were galvanized into campaigning for censorship  56   edit  Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency Public criticism brought matters to a head  In 1954  anti crime crusader Estes Kefauver led the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency  Dr  Wertham insisted upon appearing before the committee  He first presented a long list of his credentials  and then  in his clipped German accent  spoke with authority on the pernicious influence of comic books upon children  His passionate testimony at the hearings impressed the gathering  Kefauver suggested crime comics indoctrinated children in a way similar to Nazi propaganda  Wertham noted Hitler was a beginner compared to the comics industry  57  Crime Suspenstories  April May 1954  was entered as evidence in the Senate hearings  Publisher William Gaines appeared before the committee and vigorously defended his product and the industry  He took full responsibility for the horror genre  claiming he was the first to publish such comics  He insisted that delinquency was the result of the real environment and not fictional reading materials  His defiant demeanor left the committee  which felt the industry was indefensible   astonished  57  He had prepared a statement that read in part   It would be just as difficult to explain the harmless thrill of a horror story to Dr  Wertham as it would be to explain the sublimity of love to a frigid old maid   56  Crime Suspenstories  issue 22  April May 1954  was entered into evidence  The exchange between Gaines and Kefauver led to a front page story in The New York Times  He was asked by Senator Estes Kefauver  Democrat of Tennessee  if he considered in  good taste  the cover of his Shock SuspensStories  58  which depicted an axe wielding man holding aloft the severed head of a blond woman  Mr  Gaines replied   Yes  I do   for the cover of a horror comic   59  Though the committee s final report did not blame comics for crime  it recommended that the comics industry tone down its content voluntarily  60   edit  The creation of the Comics Code By 1953  nearly a quarter of all comic books published were horror titles  61  In the immediate aftermath of the hearings  however  several publishers were forced to revamp their schedules and drastically censor or even cancel many long standing comic series  56  In September 1954  the Comics Magazine Association of America  CMAA  and its Comics Code Authority  CCA  was formed  The Code had many stipulations that made it difficult for horror comics to continue publication  since any that didn t adhere to the Code s guidelines would likely not find distribution  The Code forbade the explicit presentation of  unique details and methods of crime   Scenes of excessive violence   brutal torture  excessive and unnecessary knife and gun play  physical agony  gory and gruesome crime   all scenes of horror  excessive bloodshed  gory or gruesome crimes  depravity  lust  sadism  masochism   Scenes dealing with  or instruments associated with walking dead  or torture   56   edit  Perseverance As a result of the Congressional hearings  DC Comics shifted its ongoing horror titles  House of Mystery  1951 1987  and House of Secrets  1956 1966   toward the suspense and mystery genres  often with a science fiction bent  In fact  from 1964 1968  House of Mystery became a mostly superhero title  featuring J onn J onzz  the Manhunter from Mars and  later  Dial H for Hero  Similarly  during this period Marvel Comics produced the titles Strange Tales  1951 1968  and Journey into Mystery  1952 1966   The publishers Gilberton  Dell Comics  and Gold Key Comics did not become signatories to the Comics Code  relying on their reputations as publishers of wholesome comic books  62 Classics Illustrated had adapted such horror novels as Frankenstein and Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in comic book form  and quickly issued reprints with new  less gruesome covers  Dell began publishing the licensed TV series comic book Twilight Zone in 1961 and publishing a Dracula title in 1962  Gold Key  in addition to releasing Boris Karloff Thriller  based on the TV series Thriller  and retitled Boris Karloff Tales of Mystery after the show went off the air   bought the Twilight Zone license from Dell in 1962  62  In 1965 Gold Key put out three licensed horror themed comics  two based on the TV horror comedies The Addams Family and The Munsters  and the other titled Ripley s Believe it or Not   which had three different subtitles   True Ghost Stories    True War Stories    1 and  5   and  True Demons  amp  Monsters    7   10   19   22   25   26  and  29   Warren Publishing continued the horror tradition in the mid 1960s  bypassing the Comics Code Authority restrictions by publishing magazine sized black and white horror comics  63  Under the direction of line editor Archie Goodwin  Warren debuted the horror anthologies Creepy  1964 1983  and Eerie  1966 1983   followed by Vampirella  an anthology with a lead feature starring a sexy young female vampire  The low rent Warren imitator Eerie Publications also jumped onto the black and white horror magazine business  mixing new material with reprints from pre Comics Code horror comics  most notably in its flagship title Weird  1966 1981   as well as the magazines Tales of Voodoo  1968 1974   Horror Tales  1969 1979   Tales from the Tomb  1969 1975   and Terror Tales  1969 1979   Stanley Publications also published a line of black and white horror magazines from 1966 1971  including the titles Shock and Chilling Tales of Horror   edit  Resurgence A number of supernatural mystery   suspense titles were introduced in the latter half of the 1960s  including Charlton Comics  Ghostly Tales  The Many Ghosts of Doctor Graves  and Ghost Manor  and Marvel Comics  Chamber of Darkness Monsters on the Prowl and Tower of Shadows Creatures on the Loose  At DC Comics  new House of Mystery editor Joe Orlando returned the title to its horror roots with issue  175  July Aug  1968   while the company debuted the new titles The Unexpected and The Witching Hour  In 1971  the Comics Code Authority relaxed some of its longstanding rules regarding horror comics  which opened the door to more possibilities in the genre  Scenes dealing with  or instruments associated with  walking dead or torture shall not be used  Vampires  ghouls and werewolves shall be permitted to be used when handled in the classic tradition such as Frankenstein  Dracula  and other high caliber literary works written by Edgar Allan Poe  Saki  Conan Doyle  and other respected authors whose works are read in schools around the world  64  Following this  Marvel returned to publishing true horror by first introducing a scientifically created  vampire like character  Morbius  the Living Vampire  65  followed by the introduction of Dracula in Tomb of Dracula  This opened the floodgates for more horror titles  such as the anthology Supernatural Thrillers  Werewolf by Night  and two series in which Satan or a Satan like lord of Hell figured  Ghost Rider and the feature  Son of Satan   In addition  following Warren Publishing s longtime lead  Marvel s parent company in 1971 launched a black and white magazine imprint  Curtis Magazines  which published a number of horror titles  including Dracula Lives   Monsters Unleashed  Vampire Tales  Tales of the Zombie  Haunt of Horror  and Masters of Terror  Additionally  Skywald Publications offered the black and white horror comics magazines Nightmare  Psycho  and Scream  DC during this time continued to publish supernatural fiction and occasional horror stories in such titles as Ghosts    The Dark Mansion Of Forbidden Love  later titled Forbidden Tales of Dark Mansion   Secrets of Haunted House  Secrets of Sinister House  Swamp Thing  Weird Mystery Tales   Weird War Tales  and Tales of Ghost Castle  Charlton continued in this vein as well  with Ghostly Haunts  Haunted  Midnight Tales  Haunted Love  and Scary Tales  Underground cartoonists  many of them strongly influenced by 1950s EC Comics like Tales from the Crypt  66  also tried their hands at horror  Titles like Skull  Rip Off Press  1970   Bogeyman  San Francisco Comic Book Company  1969   Fantagor  Richard Corben  1970   Insect Fear  Print Mint  1970   Up From The Deep  Rip Off Press  1971   Death Rattle  Kitchen Sink Press  1972   Gory Stories  Shroud  1972   Deviant Slice  Print Mint  1972  and Two Fisted Zombies  Last Gasp  1973  appeared in the early 1970s  By the mid 1970s  the horror comics boomlet had faded and only a few titles persevered  DC  Warren  and Charlton canceled the last of their horror anthologies by the mid 1980s  and other than DC s Swamp Thing and FantaCo s Gore Shriek  the genre lay dormant for the rest of the decade   edit  Modern horror comics  edit  North America The smaller American publishers have also published a number of successful horror comics franchises  Beginning in the late 1980s and early 1990s  independent publishers FantaCo Enterprises and Millennium Publications boasted lineups almost exclusively devoted to horror  vampire  and zombie comics  For instance  1986 saw the debut of Fantaco s horror anthology Gore Shriek  edited by Stephen R  Bissette  who also contributed stories to each issue  Bissette also edited the acclaimed anthology Taboo  which ran from 1988 1995  In the mid 1990s Harris Publications also revived Vampirella  At Image Comics  Robert Kirkman has created The Walking Dead  which helped to revitalize the zombie genre  citation needed Steve Niles predominantly writes horror comics  and his 30 Days of Night has spawned a range of mini series released by IDW Publishing  67  At Dark Horse Mike Mignola has been working on Hellboy  and has created a large fictional universe with spin off titles like BPRD and Lobster Johnson  68  In 1982  Pacific Comics produced two series that  while admittedly inspired by the E C  Comics of the 1950s  foresaw the form that horror comics would take in the coming decades  Printed in color on high quality paper stock despite a higher cover price  the series  Twisted Tales  and  Alien Worlds  were short lived and hard pressed to keep to a regular production schedule  but offered some of the most explicitly brutal and sexual stories yet to be widely distributed in a mainstream   non underground   format  The series soon shifted to Eclipse Comics production  which also produced very similar titles such as  The Twisted Tales of Bruce Jones  and  Alien Encounters   Later horror titles from DC s Vertigo line had more in common with these Pacific Eclipse efforts  and more success  than DC s sporadic efforts to revive or maintain the traditional comic horror title  e g  Elvira s House of Mystery   In 1982  DC Comics revived the Swamp Thing series  attempting to capitalize on the summer 1982 release of the Wes Craven film of the same name   The revival had actually been originally planned for 1978  but was a victim of the DC Implosion   In 1984  British writer Alan Moore took over the writing chores the title  and when Karen Berger took over as editor  she gave Moore free rein to revamp the title and the character as he saw fit  Moore reconfigured Swamp Thing s origin to make him a true monster as opposed to a human transformed into a monster  Moore s  and artists Stephen R  Bissette and John Totleben s  Swamp Thing was a critical and commercial success  and in 1988 spun off the ongoing series Hellblazer  starring occult detective John Constantine  In 1993 DC introduced its mature readers Vertigo line  which folded in a number of popular horror titles  including Hellblazer and Swamp Thing  One of Vertigo s early successes was Neil Gaiman s Sandman  which reworked a number of DC s old horror characters and added fantasy to the mix  A number of other horror titles carried on at Vertigo  like Deadman  House of Mystery and Haunted Tank  or were given a horror spin or an update like Kid Eternity and Jonah Hex  Vertigo also published more conventional horror  like vampires in Bite Club  beginning in 2004   69  and Vamps  In addition  from 1999 2001 they published their own horror anthology  Flinch  Other than a Ghost Rider revival from 1990 1998  Marvel Comics basically sat out the 1990s horror comics resurgence  But in the 2000s the company produced a large stable of ongoing horror comics titles  like Ghost Rider and Blade  which have been drawn together in the Midnight Sons  a group that crossed over with the Marvel Zombies series in Marvel Zombies 4  Marvel s adult imprint MAX  introduced in 2001  has also provided a venue for reinterpretations of Marvel horror characters where more violence can be used  leading to the Dead of Night mini series based on Devil Slayer  70  71 Werewolf by Night 72  and Man Thing  73  as well as a reworking of Zombie 74  and Hellstorm  Son of Satan  75  76 Richard Corben has also been writing Haunt of Horror  a number of series based on the work of Edgar Allan Poe and H P  Lovecraft  77   edit  Great Britain In the post World War II period  horror comics arrived in Britain  largely based on reprints of American material  This led to protests similar to those in the States  In 1955  the Children and Young Persons  Harmful Publications  Act was introduced  which saw the horror reprints disappear from the news agents  shelves  78  In the early seventies there were a couple of horror comics  Shiver and Shake and Monster Fun  but these were also humour titles pitched at younger children  It was only during the boom in British comics in the late seventies and early eighties that there were horror comics pitched at older boys and girls  Scream  and Misty  respectively  Whether it was fears over the content  or the difficult financial times in the mid eighties  Scream  stopped publishing in 1985  with only two of its stories being merged with the Eagle  After the collapse in comics the only mainstream venue was 2000 AD  which has featured stories like Chiaroscuro and Cradlegrave  as well as those drawing on the Cthulhu Mythos for Necronauts and Caballistics  Inc   The British small press also publishes horror comics  like the anthology Something Wicked  In 2008  the London Horror Comic launched  becoming the first dedicated full colour UK horror comic to be shipped worldwide through Diamond Comic Distributors  79   edit  Japan Just like Gekiga  horror manga started to appear in the lending libraries  Kashihonya  of the late 1950s and early 1960s and expanded into the mainstream through the works of artists like Shigeru Mizuki  GeGeGe no Kitaro   Jir  Tsunoda  Ky fu Shimbun   Kazuo Umezu  The Drifting Classroom  and Shin ichi Koga  Eko Eko Azarak   While most of them published in sh nen magazines and often with scary  yet sympathetic protagonists leading through tales about ghosts and demons  Umezu for instance got his start in sh jo magazines  where psychological depth was the main focus  a famous title being Hebi Sh jo  The subculture also continued publishing horror manga  Hideshi Hino created lots of stories for the alternative magazine Garo and for the publisher Hibari Shob   which specialized in horror manga in the 1970s  Suehiro Maruo followed the traditions of the Ero guro movement of the 1920s and included extreme depictions of gore in his works  Horror stayed a niche in mainstream manga  There was no magazine specialized solely on horror comics until the 1980s  when Asahi Sonorama founded Halloween magazine in 1986 due to the recent success of artists like Ry ko Takashina in mainstream sh jo magazines like Ribon  Junji It  became the most famous contributor to the magazine with his Tomie series  Similar publications like Horror M  Bunkasha   also mainly targeted at women  started to appear  Magazines like Nemuki  Asahi Sonorama   Susperia Mystery  Akita Shoten  and Apple Mystery  Shufu to Seikatsusha  were also founded as part of this movement  but concentrated on more subtle and less graphic depictions of horror  Artists drawing for those magazine like Ichiko Ima  Hyakkiyak  Sh    Matsuri Akino  Pet Shop of Horrors  and Narumi Kakinouchi  Vampire Princess Miyu  became famous   edit  Horror webcomics Horror comics are also published on the web  Successful horror webcomics include High Moon and Eric Monster Millikin   edit  Other media Horror comics have been heavily influenced by other media  especially film  and have in return  more recently influenced films  Comics have formed part of the media franchise for popular horror movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre  Friday the 13th  Halloween and Army of Darkness  They have also been adapted horror video games  like Silent Hill  Horror comics have also been sources for horror films like 30 Days of Night  Hellboy and Blade  Horror manga  like other manga  have been the basis for adaptations into films and TV  especially the work of Junji Ito which led to the film Uzumaki  Hideshi Hino directed two of the Guinea Pig films based on his manga  Guinea Pig  Flower of Flesh and Blood in 1985 and Guinea Pig  Mermaid in a Manhole in 1988  Kirkman s The Walking Dead has been adapted into an ongoing TV series by showrunner Frank Darabont  It debuted on October 31  2010 on the AMC cable network  to universal acclaim  They have also been a venue for failed horror films  including the horror film crossover Freddy vs  Jason vs  Ash  they have allowed series to continue as happened with Buffy Season Eight and offered a chance to provide prequels or fill in gaps between films  like Saw  Rebirth and 28 Days Later  The Aftermath  respectively   edit  Horror hosts In the 1930s 1950s  radio dramatic anthology series devoted to horror and suspense plays  such as Lights Out  Quiet  Please  The Whistler  and Inner Sanctum Mysteries  had more or less sinister  hosts  who introduced and wrapped up the stories  This tradition was introduced into horror comics  many of which were also anthology titles  with many stories in each issue  EC Comics utilized the conceit of a character who  hosted  the book  often starring in a framing sequence at the beginning of each issue  The most notorious EC hosts were the  GhouLunatics   The Crypt Keeper  The Old Witch  and The Vault Keeper  In the 1960s  Warren came up with the hosts Uncle Creepy and Cousin Eerie  and DC followed suit with their hosts Cain and Abel  as well as such minor hosts as Eve  Destiny  Lucien  and the Mad Mod Witch   80  Charlton had a large cast of hosts for their various horror suspense titles  Marvel Comics never really embraced the host character for their various titles  though for a short time they did use Digger and Headstone P  Gravely  The following is a list of hosts from various horror comics titles from over the years  Title Host Publisher Publication dates Chamber of Darkness Digger Headstone P  Gravely Marvel 1969 1971  retitled as Monsters on the Prowl  with no host
