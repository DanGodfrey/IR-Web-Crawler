Brunei  and maritime borders exist with Singapore  Vietnam  and the Philippines  The capital city is Kuala Lumpur  while Putrajaya is the seat of the federal government  In 2010 the population exceeded 27 5 million  with over 20 million living on the Peninsula  Malaysia has its origins in the Malay Kingdoms present in the area which  from the 18th century  became subject to the British Empire  The first British territories were known as the Straits Settlements  whose establishment was followed by the Malay kingdoms becoming British protectorates  The territories on Peninsular Malaysia were first unified as the Malayan Union in 1946  Malaya was restructured as the Federation of Malaya in 1948  and achieved independence on 31 August 1957  Malaya united with Sabah  Sarawak  and Singapore on 16 September 1963  with si being added to give the new country the name Malaysia  However  less than two years later in 1965  Singapore was expelled from the federation  Since independence  Malaysia has had one of the best economic records in Asia  with GDP growing an average 6 5  for almost 50 years  The economy has traditionally been fuelled by its natural resources  but is expanding in the sectors of science  tourism  commerce and medical tourism  The country is multi ethnic and multi cultural  which plays a large role in politics  The government system is closely

Archipelago on a 1914 map from a United States atlas The word Melayu is thought to derive from the Sanskrit term Malaiur or Malayadvipa  which can be translated as  land of mountains   the word used by ancient Indian traders when referring to the Malay Peninsula  11  12  13  14  15  Other theories propose it originates from the Tamil word Malai  meaning  mountain   16  The term was later used as the name of the Melayu Kingdom  which existed between the 7th and 13th centuries on Sumatra  17  Following his 1826 expedition in Oceania  French navigator Jules Dumont d Urville invented the terms Malaysia  Micronesia and Melanesia  distinguishing these Pacific cultures and island groups from the existing term Polynesia  In 1831  he proposed these terms to the Soci t  de G ographie  Dumont d Urville described Malaysia as  an area commonly known as the East Indies   18  In 1850  the English ethnologist George Samuel Windsor Earl  writing in the Journal of the Indian Archipelago and Eastern Asia  proposed naming the islands of Southeast Asia as Melayunesia or Indunesia  favouring the former  19  In 1957  the Federation of Malaya was declared as an independent federation of the Malay states on the Malay Peninsula  20  The name  Malaysia  was adopted in 1963 when the existing states of the Federation of Malaya  plus Singapore  North Borneo and Sarawak formed a new federation  with  si  being added to Malaya in honour of the three joining states  21  Prior to that  the name itself had been used to refer to the whole Malay Archipelago  22  Politicians in the Philippines contemplated renaming their state  Malaysia  before the modern country took the name  23  At the time of federation  other names were considered  among them was Langkasuka  after the historic kingdom located at the upper section of the Malay Peninsula in the 1st millennium CE  24  History Main article  History of Malaysia Evidence of modern human habitation in Malaysia dates back 40 000 years  25  The first inhabitants are thought to be Negritos  26  Traders and settlers from India and China arrived as early as the 1st century AD  establishing trading ports and coastal towns in the 2nd and 3rd centuries  Their presence resulted in strong Indian and Chinese influence on the local cultures  and the people of the Malay Peninsula adopted the religions of Hinduism and Buddhism  Sanskrit inscriptions appear as early as the 4th or 5th century  27  The Kingdom of Langkasuka arose around the 2nd century in the northern area of the Malay Peninsula  lasting until about the 15th century  24  Between the 7th and 13th centuries  much of the southern Malay Peninsula was part of the maritime Srivijaya empire  After the fall of Srivijaya  the Majapahit empire had influence over most of Peninsular Malaysia and the Malay Archipelago  28  Islam began to spread among Malays in the 14th century  3  In the early 15th century  Parameswara  a prince of the former Srivijayan empire  founded the Malacca Sultanate  commonly considered the first independent state in the peninsula  29  Malacca was an important commercial centre during this time  attracting trade from around the region  Parameswara became a Muslim  accelerating the spread of Islam  3  A Famosa fortress in Malacca was built by the Portuguese in the 16th century  In 1511 Malacca was conquered by Portugal  3  after which it was taken by the Dutch in 1641  In 1786 the British Empire established a presence in Malaya  when the Sultan of Kedah leased Penang to the British East India Company  The British obtained the town of Singapore in 1819  30  and in 1824 took control of Malacca following the Anglo Dutch Treaty  By 1826 the British directly controlled Penang  Malacca  Singapore  and the island of Labuan  which they established as the crown colony of the Straits Settlements  By the 20th century  the states of Pahang  Selangor  Perak  and Negeri Sembilan  known together as the Federated Malay States  had British Residents appointed to advise the Malay rulers  to whom the rulers were bound to defer by treaty  31  The remaining five states in the peninsula  known as the Unfederated Malay States  while not directly under British rule  also accepted British advisers around the turn of the 20th century  Development on the Peninsula and Borneo were generally separate until the 19th century  Under British rule the immigration of Chinese and Indians to serve as labourers was encouraged  32  Sabah was governed as the crown colony of British North Borneo after it was leased from the Sultanate of Sulu in 1878  33  In 1842  Sarawak was ceded by the Sultan of Brunei to James Brooke  whose successors ruled as the White Rajahs over an independent kingdom until 1946  when it became a British colony  34  In the Second World War the Japanese army invaded and subsequently occupied Malaya  Sabah  Sarawak  and Singapore for over three years  During this time  ethnic tensions were raised and nationalism grew  35  Popular support for independence increased after Malaya was reconquered by Allied Forces  36  Post war British plans to unite the administration of Malaya under a single crown colony called the Malayan Union met with strong opposition from the Malays  who opposed the weakening of the Malay rulers and the granting of citizenship to the ethnic Chinese  The Malayan Union  established in 1946 and consisting of all the British possessions in the Malay Peninsula with the exception of Singapore  was quickly dissolved and replaced by the Federation of Malaya  which restored the autonomy of the rulers of the Malay states under British protection  37  During this time  mostly Chinese rebels under the leadership of the Malayan Communist Party launched guerrilla operations designed to force the British out of Malaya  The Malayan Emergency lasted from 1948 to 1960  and involved a long anti insurgency campaign by Commonwealth troops in Malaya  38  After this a plan was put in place to federate Malaya with the British crown colonies of Sabah  Sarawak  and Singapore  The proposed date of federation was 31 August 1963  however  the date was delayed until 16 September 1963 due to opposition from Indonesia s Sukarno and the Sarawak United Peoples  Party  39  Merdeka Square in Kuala Lumpur  where Independence Day is celebrated on 31 August each year  Federation brought heightened tensions including a conflict with Indonesia  Singapore s eventual exit in 1965  40  41  and racial strife  This strife culminated in the 13 May race riots in 1969  42  After the riots  the controversial New Economic Policy was launched by Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak  trying to increase the share of the economy held by the bumiputra  43  Under Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad there was a period of rapid economic growth and urbanisation beginning in the 1980s  The economy shifted from being agriculturally based to one based on manufacturing and industry  Numerous mega projects were completed  such as the Petronas Towers  the North South Expressway  the Multimedia Super Corridor  and the new federal administrative capital of Putrajaya  21  However  in the late 1990s the Asian financial crisis almost caused the collapse of the currency and the stock and property markets  44  Governance Main article  Politics of Malaysia The Malaysian Houses of Parliament is the building where the Malaysian Parliament assembles  Malaysia is a federal constitutional elective monarchy  The system of government is closely modelled on that of the Westminster parliamentary system  a legacy of British colonial rule  45  The head of state is the Yang di Pertuan Agong  commonly referred to as the king  The King is elected to a five year term by and from among the nine hereditary rulers of the Malay states  the other four states  which have titular Governors  do not participate in the selection  By informal agreement the position is systematically rotated among the nine  45  and has been held by Abdul Halim of Kedah since December 2011  46  The King s role has been largely ceremonial since changes to the constitution in 1994  picking ministers and members of the upper house  47  Legislative power is divided between federal and state legislatures  The bicameral federal parliament consists of the lower house  the House of Representatives and the upper house  the Senate  48  The 222 member House of Representatives is elected for a maximum term of five years from single member constituencies  All 70 senators sit for three year terms  26 are elected by the 13 state assemblies  and the remaining 44 are appointed by the King upon the Prime Minister s recommendation  3  The parliament follows a multi party system and the government is elected through a first past the post system  Since independence Malaysia has been governed by a multi party coalition known as the Barisan Nasional  3  Each state has a unicameral State Legislative Assembly whose members are elected from single member constituencies  State governments are led by Chief Ministers  3  who are state assembly members from the majority party in the assembly  In each of the states with a hereditary ruler  the Chief Minister is required to be a Malay  appointed by the ruler upon the recommendation of the Prime Minister  49  Parliamentary elections are held at least once every five years  the most recent of which took place in March 2008  3  Registered voters of age 21 and above may vote for the members of the House of Representatives and  in most of the states  for the state legislative chamber  Voting is not mandatory  50  Except for elections in Sarawak  all state elections are held concurrently with the federal election  47  Najib Razak  Prime Minister since 2009  Executive power is vested in the Cabinet  led by the Prime Minister  The prime minister must be a member of the house of representatives  who in the opinion of the King  commands a majority in parliament  The cabinet is chosen from members of both houses of Parliament  3  The Prime Minister is both the head of cabinet and the head of government  47  The incumbent  Najib Razak  appointed in 2009  is the sixth prime minister  51  Malaysia s legal system is based on English Common Law  3  Although the judiciary is theoretically independent  its independence has been called into question and the appointment of judges lacks accountability and transparency  52  The highest court in the judicial system is the Federal Court  followed by the Court of Appeal and two high courts  one for Peninsular Malaysia and one for East Malaysia  Malaysia also has a special court to hear cases brought by or against Royalty  53  Separate from the civil courts are the Syariah Courts  which apply Shariah law to cases which involve Malaysian Muslims 54  and run parallel to the secular court system  55  The Internal Security Act allows detention without trial  and the death penalty is in use for crimes such as drug trafficking  56  Race is a significant force in politics  and many political parties are ethnically based  3  Actions such as the New Economic Policy 43  and the National Development Policy which superseded it  were implemented to advance the standing of the bumiputra  consisting of Malays and the indigenous tribes who are considered the original inhabitants of Malaysia  over non bumiputra such as Malaysian Chinese and Malaysian Indians  57  These policies provide preferential treatment to bumiputra in employment  education  scholarships  business  and access to cheaper housing and assisted savings  However  it has generated greater interethnic resentment  58  There is ongoing debate over whether the laws and society of Malaysia should reflect secular or Islamic principles  59  Islamic laws passed by the Pan Malaysian Islamic Party in state legislative assemblies have been blocked by the federal government  60  Foreign relations and

Nations  67  Kuala Lumpur was the site of the first East Asia Summit in 2005  68  Malaysia s foreign policy is officially based on the principle of neutrality and maintaining peaceful relations with all countries  regardless of their political system  69  The government attaches a high priority to the security and stability of Southeast Asia  68  and seeks to further develop relations with other countries in the region  Historically the government has tried to portray Malaysia as a progressive Islamic nation 69  while strengthening relations with other Islamic states  68  A strong tenet of Malaysia s policy is national sovereignty and the right of a country to control its domestic affairs  47  The policy towards territorial disputes by the government is one of pragmatism  with the government solving disputes in a number of ways  such as bringing the case to the International Court of Justice  70  The Spratly Islands are disputed by many states in the area  although tensions have eased since the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea  Brunei and Malaysia in 2008 announced an end to claims of each other s land  and to resolve issues related to their maritime borders  The Philippines has a dormant claim to Sabah  Singapore s land reclamation has caused tensions  and maritime border disputes exist with Indonesia  71  Royal Malaysian Navy s first Scorp ne class submarine Malaysia has never recognised Israel and has no diplomatic ties with it  72  It has remained a strong supporter of the State of Palestine  73  and has called for Israel

United Kingdom  77  Joint exercises and war games have been held with Indonesia for years  78  Malaysia and the Philippines have agreed to host joint security force exercises in order to secure their maritime border and tackle issues such as illegal immigration  79  There are fears that unrest in the Muslim areas of the southern Philippines 80  and southern Thailand 81  could spill over into Malaysia  Subdivisions Main articles  States and federal territories of Malaysia and Districts of Malaysia Perlis Kedah Penang Kelantan Terengganu Perak Selangor Negeri Sembilan Malacca Johor Pahang Sarawak Sabah Labuan Kuala Lumpur Putrajaya South China Sea Strait of Malacca Gulf of Thailand Sulu Sea Celebes Sea Malaysia is a federation of 13 states and three federal territories  These are divided between two regions  with 11 states and two federal territories on Peninsular Malaysia and the other two states and one federal territory in East Malaysia  Governance of the states is divided between the federal and the state governments  and the Federal government has direct administration of the federal territories  82  The 13 states are based on historical Malay Kingdoms  and 9 of the 11 Peninsular states  known as the Malay states  retain their royal families  The King is elected by and from the nine rulers to serve a five year term  3  Each state has a unicameral legislature known as the State Legislative Assembly  The states of East Malaysia  Sabah and Sarawak  have separate immigration policies and controls  and a unique residency status  83  For citizens of one of these states or Peninsular Malaysia  the other areas of Malaysia are considered foreign countries under immigration laws  84  Each state is further divided into districts  which are then divided into mukim  In Sabah and Sarawak districts are grouped into divisions  85  The federal parliament is permitted to legislate on issues of land  the Islamic religion and local government  in order to provide for a uniform law among all states  It may also intervene at the request of the state assembly concerned  Except for some land related laws  the in question must also be passed by the state assembly  Non Islamic issues that fall under the purview of the state may also be legislated at the federal level for the purpose of conforming with Malaysian treaty obligations  86  Geography Main article  Geography of Malaysia A view from Low s peak  the highest peak of Mount Kinabalu Malaysia is the 66th largest country by total land area  with a land area of 329 847 square kilometres  127 355 sq mi   It has land borders with Thailand in West Malaysia  and Indonesia and Brunei in East Malaysia  2  It is linked to Singapore by a narrow causeway  and also has maritime boundaries with Vietnam 87  and the Philippines  88  The land borders are defined in large part by geological features such as the Perlis River  the Golok River and the Pagalayan Canal  whilst some of the maritime boundaries are the subject of ongoing contention  2  Brunei forms what is almost an enclave in Malaysia  89  with the state of Sarawak dividing it into two parts  Malaysia is the only country with territory on both the Asian mainland and the Malay archipelago  90 Tanjung Piai  located in the southern state of Johor  is the southernmost tip of continental Asia  91  The Strait of Malacca  lying between Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia  is one of the most important thoroughfares in global commerce  carrying 40 per cent of the world s trade  92  The two parts of Malaysia  separated from each other by the South China Sea  share a largely similar landscape in that both Peninsular and East Malaysia feature coastal plains rising to hills and mountains  2  Peninsular Malaysia  containing 40 per cent of Malaysia s land area  90  extends 740 kilometres  460 mi  from north to south  and its maximum width is 322 kilometres  200 mi   93  It is divided between its east and west coasts by the Titiwangsa Mountains  94  part of a series of mountain ranges running down the centre of the peninsula  90  These mountains are heavily forested  95  and mainly composed of granite and other igneous rocks  Much of it has been eroded  creating a karst landscape  90  The range is the origin of some of Peninsular Malaysia s river systems  95  The coastal plains surrounding the peninsula reach a maximum width of 50 kilometres  31 mi   and the peninsula s coastline is nearly 1 931 kilometres  1 200 mi  long  although harbours are only available on the western side  93  National Park  Pahang East Malaysia  on the island of Borneo  has a coastline of 2 607 kilometres  1 620 mi   2  It is divided between coastal regions  hills and valleys  and a mountainous interior  90  The Crocker Range extends northwards from Sarawak  90  dividing the state of Sabah  It is the location of the 4 095 2 metres  13 436 ft  high Mount Kinabalu  96  the tallest mountain in Malaysia  Mount Kinabalu is protected as the Kinabalu National Park  a UNESCO World Heritage Site  97  The highest mountain ranges form the border between Malaysia and Indonesia  Sarawak contains the Mulu Caves  the largest cave system in the world  90  Around these two halves of Malaysia are numerous islands  the largest of which is Banggi  98  The local climate is equatorial and characterised by the annual southwest  April to October  and northeast  October to February  monsoons  93  The temperature is moderated by the presence of the surrounding oceans  90  Humidity is usually high  and the average annual rainfall is 250 centimetres  98 in   93  The climates of the Peninsula and the East differ  as the climate on the peninsula is directly affected by wind from the mainland  as opposed to the more maritime weather of the East  Local climates can be divided into three regions  highland  lowland  and coastal  Climate change is likely to affect sea levels and rainfall  increasing flood risks and leading to droughts  90  Biodiversity Main article  Wildlife of Malaysia Proboscis monkey in Borneo Malaysia is a megadiverse country with a high number of species and high levels of endemism  99  It is estimated to contain 20 per cent of the world s animal species  100  High levels of endemism are found on the diverse forests of Borneo s mountains  as species are isolated from each other by lowland forest  90  There are about 210 mammal species in the country  101  Over 620 species of birds have been recorded in Peninsular Malaysia  100  with many endemic to the mountains there  A high number of endemic bird species are also found in Malaysian Borneo  90  250 reptile species have been recorded in the country  with about 150 species of snakes 102  and 80 species of lizards  101  There are about 150 species of frogs  101  and thousands of insect species  101  Malaysia s exclusive economic zone is 1 5 times larger than its land area  103  and some of its waters are in the Coral Triangle  a biodiversity hotspot  104  The waters around Sipadan island are the most biodiverse in the world  100  Bordering East Malaysia  the Sulu Sea is a biodiversity hotspot  with around 600 coral species and 1200 fish species  105  About two thirds of Malaysia is covered in forest  93  with some forests believed to be 130 million years old  101  The forests are dominated by dipterocarps  106  Lowland forest occurs below 760 metres  2 493 ft   93  and formerly East Malaysia was covered in such rainforest  106  which is supported by its hot wet climate  90  There are around 14 500 species of flowering plants and trees  101  Besides rainforests  there are over 1 425 square kilometres  550 sq mi  of mangroves in Malaysia  93  and a large amount of peat forest  At higher altitudes  oaks  chestnuts  and rhododendrons replace dipterocarps  90  There are an estimated 8 500 species of vascular plants in Peninsular Malaysia  with another 15 000 in the East  107  The forests of East Malaysia are estimated to be the habitat of around 2 000 tree species  and are one of the most biodiverse areas in the world  with 240 different species of trees every hectare  90  These forests host many members of the Rafflesia genus  the largest flowers in the world  106  with a maximum diameter of 1 metre  3 ft   101  Some species of Rafflesia can grow up to 1 metre  3 ft  in diameter  making them the largest flowers in the world  Logging  along with cultivation practices has devastated tree cover  causing severe environmental degradation in the country  Over 80 per cent of Sarawak s rainforest has been cleared  90  Floods in East Malaysia have been worsened by the loss of trees  and over 60 per cent of the Peninsular s forest have been cleared  101  With current rates of deforestation  the forests are predicted to be extinct by 2020  90 Deforestation is a major problem for fauna  as the forest is cut to make room for plantations  108  Most remaining forest is found inside national parks  101  Habitat destruction has proved a threat for marine life  105  Illegal fishing is another major threat  105  with fishing methods such as dynamite fishing and poisoning depleting marine ecosystems  109 Leatherback turtle numbers have dropped 98 per cent since the 1950s  102  Hunting has also been an issue for some animals  101  with overconsumption and the use of animal parts for profit endangering many animals  from marine life 105  to tigers  108  Marine life is also detrimentally affected by uncontrolled tourism  110  The Malaysian government aims to balance economic growth with environmental protection  but has been accused of favouring big business over the environment  101  Some state governments are now trying to counter the environmental impact and pollution created by deforestation  106  and the federal government is trying to cut logging by 10 per cent each year  28 national parks have been established  23 in East Malaysia and seven in the Peninsular  101  Tourism has been limited in biodiverse areas such as Sipadan island  110  Animal trafficking is a large issue  and the Malaysian government is holding talks with the governments of Brunei and Indonesia to standardise anti trafficking laws  111  Economy Main article  Economy of Malaysia Malaysia is a relatively open state oriented and newly industrialised market economy  112  113  The state plays a significant but declining role in guiding economic activity through macroeconomic plans  Malaysia has had one of the best economic records in Asia  with GDP growing an average 6 5 per cent annually from 1957 to 2005  3  In 2010 the GDP  PPP  was  414 400 billion  the 3rd largest economy in ASEAN and 29th largest in the world  114  An oil palm plantation  from which palm oil is extracted  In the 1970s  the predominantly mining and agricultural based economy began a transition towards a more multi sector economy  Since the 1980s the industrial sector has led Malaysia s growth  115  High levels of investment played a significant role in this  3  The economy recovered from the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis sooner than neighbouring countries  and has since recovered to the levels of the pre crisis era with a GDP per capita of  14 800  116  117  Inequalities exist between different ethnic groups  The Chinese make up about one third of the population but accounts for 70 per cent of the country s market capitalisation  118  International trade  facilitated by the adjacent Strait of Malacca shipping route  and manufacturing are key sectors of the country s economy  119  120  121  Malaysia is an exporter of natural and agricultural resources  the most valuable exported resource being petroleum  3  At one time  it was the largest producer of tin  122 rubber and palm oil in the world  Manufacturing has a large influence in the country s economy  123  although Malaysia s economic structure has been moving away from it  124  Malaysia remains one of the worlds largest producers of palm oil  125  In an effort to diversify the economy and make it less dependent on exported goods  the government has pushed to increase tourism to Malaysia  As a result  tourism has become Malaysia s third largest source of income from foreign exchange  although it is threatened by the negative effects of the growing industrial economy  with large amounts of air and water pollution along with deforestation affecting tourism  126  The country has developed into a centre of Islamic banking  and is the country with the highest numbers of female workers in that industry  127  Knowledge based services are also expanding  124  Science policies in Malaysia are regulated by the Ministry of Science  Technology  and Innovation  The country is one of the world s largest exporters of

Substantial influence exists from Chinese and Indian culture  dating back to when foreign trade began  Other cultural influences include the Persian  Arabic  and British cultures  Due to the structure of the government  coupled with the social contract theory  there has been minimal cultural assimilation of ethnic minorities  169  In 1971  the government created a  National Cultural Policy   defining Malaysian culture  It stated that Malaysian culture must be based on the culture of the indigenous peoples of Malaysia  that it may incorporate suitable elements from other cultures  and that Islam must play a part in it  170  It also promoted the Malay language above others  171  This government intervention into culture has caused resentment among non Malays who feel their cultural freedom was lessened  Both Chinese and Indian associations have submitted memorandums to the government  accusing it of formulating an undemocratic culture policy  170  Some cultural disputes exist between Malaysia and neighbouring countries  notably Indonesia  The two countries have a similar cultural heritage  sharing many traditions and items  However  disputes have arisen over things ranging from culinary dishes to Malaysia s national anthem  Strong feelings exist in Indonesia about protecting their national heritage  172  The Malaysian government and the Indonesian government have met to

also bears resemblance to Filipino cuisine  90  The different states have varied dishes  101  and often the food in Malaysia is different from the original dishes  135  Sometimes food not found in its original culture is assimilated into another  for example  Chinese restaurants in Malaysia often serve Malay dishes  181  Food from one culture is sometimes also cooked using styles taken from another culture  101  This means that although much of Malaysian food can be traced back to a certain culture  they have their own identity  180  Rice is popular in many dishes  Chili is commonly found in local cuisine  although this does not necessarily make them spicy  179  Holidays and festivals Main article  Public holidays in Malaysia South East Asia s Largest Temple  Kek Lok Si in Penang being
