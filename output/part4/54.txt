Personal life  edit  Early life Perelman was born in Greensboro  North Carolina on January 1  1943 to Raymond and Ruth Perelman  3  He was raised in a Jewish family  4  Raymond was an accomplished businessman in his own right  Along with his father and brother  he controlled the American Paper Products corporation  Raymond eventually left the company and bought Belmont Iron Works  a manufacturer of structural steel  5  On Raymond s knee  Perelman learned the fundamentals of business  6  By the time Ronald turned eleven years old he regularly sat in on board meetings of his father s company  Raymond was a rough teacher  harshly criticizing Ronald for even the slightest misstep  3  A recent article published in the Forbes 400 discusses their relationship in detail  7  Perelman attended The Haverford School and then the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania where he followed in his father s foot steps and majored in business  He graduated in 1964 and completed his master s in 1966  8   edit  Marriage Perelman has been married five times  He married Sterling Bank heiress Faith Golding in 1965 and they divorced in 1984  His marriage to gossip columnist Claudia Cohen lasted from 1985 to 1994  He wed socialite Patricia Duff in 1994 and divorced in 1996  He was married to actress Ellen Barkin from 2000 to 2006  On October 13  2010  Perelman married Dr  Anna Chapman  a Harvard educated psychiatrist   edit  Faith Golding Perelman met his first wife  Faith Golding  in 1965 while on a cruise to Israel  As the heir to a fortune made in real estate and banking  Faith Golding controlled a personal fortune of around  100 million at the time of their marriage  9  They adopted three children named Steven  Josh  and Hope  and Faith gave birth to a fourth child named Debra  Their marriage lasted until 1984 when Faith discovered Perelman was having an affair with a local florist after a bill for a Bulgari bracelet was sent to their home instead of Perelman s office  Faith threatened to scuttle Perelman s attempt to take MacAndrews  amp  Forbes private in 1983 by staking a claim to a third of it due to a bank loan in her name  She further declared that Perelman defrauded the owners of the First Sterling Corporation  i e  her  by buying thousands of dollars of gifts for the florist with the company s money  and made a very public spectacle of the divorce  Ronald Perelman responded by hiring Roy Cohn and flatly denying all of the allegations  The pair quickly settled the divorce with an estimated payout to Faith in excess of  8 million  10   edit  Claudia Cohen Ronald  amp  Samantha Perelman Perelman met his second wife  Claudia Cohen  in 1984 at Le Cirque  They had one daughter together  Samantha  In August 1993  Ron filed for divorce  11  Claudia left the marriage with well over  80 million  11  In 2007  Claudia died after a secret seven year battle with ovarian cancer  Perelman revealed during his speech at her funeral that he d known about her cancer from the beginning and privately commissioned a vaccine as a part of his efforts to cure her  12  In March 2008  Perelman decided to change the name of Logan Hall  located at the University of Pennsylvania  to Cohen Hall  after his late ex wife  13  He donated  20 million to the University to remodel what is now Perelman Quadrangle and as part of his donation  he had the option to change the name of Logan Hall  His decision to rename Logan Hall dismayed some Penn faculty  alumni  and students  14   edit  Patricia Duff Patricia Duff was Perelman s third wife and messiest citation needed  divorce  The pair first met in a Paris hotel lobby when both were still married  Perelman to Cohen  and Duff to Mike Medavoy  15  After Duff divorced Medavoy  she soon married Perelman on January 25  1995  She gave birth to his fourth daughter  Caleigh Sophia  before the wedding took place  16  When the marriage between Duff and Perelman disintegrated in 1996  custody over Caleigh became a major issue  Both Perelman and Duff wanted full custody and their prenuptial agreement did not address the subject of child support  Initially private  the divorce proceedings were opened to the public at the request of Duff  17  Neither party emerged with their reputations unscathed  The court psychiatrist found Duff to be paranoid and narcissistic and Perelman to have serious anger management issues  18  Perelman caught a great deal of flak for testifying that it cost about  3 a day to feed his daughter  19  and both sides alleged physical abuse by the other party  20  The judge s sealed decision means the public will never know the exact results of the case  17  but it s known that neither party actually won  Perelman is Caleigh s legal guardian  but Patricia has extensive visitation rights  21   edit  Ellen Barkin Ellen Barkin Perelman met his fourth wife  actress Ellen Barkin  at a Vanity Fair Oscar after party in 1999  22  After slightly more than a year of courtship  the two married in June 2000  All accounts indicate their five year marriage was a stormy one  Much of the friction arose due to Ellen s acting career and her attendant travel schedule  but their mutually explosive tempers didn t help either  Perelman filed and obtained a divorce in early 2006  The press soundly mocked Perelman for his actions  the speed and timing of which suggested his real motivation was to avoid a clause in his prenuptial that would raise the amount in alimony he owed Ellen if he waited a few days longer  Depending on the source used  Ellen s yearly alimony ranges from  2 million to  3 million and the total payout ranged from  20 million to  65 million  23  In late 2007  the pair exchanged lawsuits  Part of the divorce settlement required Perelman to invest several million dollars in a film production company Ellen and her brother George  an aspiring screenwriter  had started  Perelman made only one of the payments  claiming that there was no evidence the two were actually producing films  Ellen sued for her money while Perelman counter sued  alleging Ellen and her brother had looted the film company for themselves  24   edit  Anna Chapman Since summer 2006  25 Perelman has been dating psychiatrist Dr  Anna Chapman  In August 2010 they announced they are expecting a baby   her first  his seventh  via a surrogate  26   In September 2010  they were married  27   And in late November  2010  the couple celebrated the birth of their son  Oscar  28    edit  Philanthropy Ronald Perelman gives extensively to charity   he is consistently one of the world s top philanthropists  and has donated well over  200 million to charitable causes in the past decade  In August 2011  Ronald Perelman hosted his second annual benefit for the Apollo Theater  raising over  1 5 million  29  Richard Gere and Carey Lowell  George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth  and former Secretary of State Colin Powell were among attendees  performers included Ben E  King  Bettye Lavette  Jon Bon Jovi  Jamie Foxx and Alicia Keys  Mr  Perelman s 2010 event also raised over  1 million for the famed Apollo Theater  In August 2010  Ronald Perelman signed the Gates Buffett Pledge  committing up to half his assets to be designated for the benefit of charitable causes  after his family and children have been provided for   Recently  one of his biggest transformational gifts a  50 million donation was to the New York Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medical Center  The  50 million gift created the Ronald O  Perelman Heart Institute  and provided vital financial aid to the Ronald O  Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine  30  On May 4  2008  on The O Reilly Factor  FOX News star Bill O Reilly named Mr  Perelman an  American Patriot  for this gift during the program s  Pinheads and Patriots  segment  MacAndrews  amp  Forbes has a strong commitment to philanthropy  with its core mission focused on women s health issues  education  and the arts  Led by Perelman  the company established the Revlon UCLA Women s Cancer Research Program in 1994 for research into the causes and treatment of breast and ovarian cancer  The program is responsible for the development of Herceptin  the first genetically based treatment for a major cancer to be approved by the FDA  The company also founded the Ronald O  Perelman Department of Dermatology at NYU Medical Center  recognized internationally as a leader in patient care  education and research for skin diseases  Over the years  MacAndrews  amp  Forbes has also provided significant support for such organizations as the National Breast Cancer Coalition Fund  Carnegie Hall  the Solomon R  Guggenheim Museum  Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital and Mr  Perelman s alma mater  The University of Pennsylvania  In 2008  the Chronicle of Philanthropy listed Perelman as the 26th largest donor in the USA  Mr  Perelman donated  63 5 million in 2008 to causes including  but not limited to  Weill Medical College of Cornell University  Other key beneficiaries  Stand Up to Cancer  World Trade Center Memorial Fund and Ford s Theatre  Mr  Perelman pledged  25 million to Weill Medical College  in New York  to support research  education  and patient care at the Ronald O  Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine  In addition  Mr  Perelman pledged  15 million to Stand Up to Cancer  a Pasadena  Calif   organization that supports cancer research and efforts to advance treatment for cancer patients   5 million to the World Trade Center Memorial Fund  in New York  and  2 5 million to Ford s Theatre  in Washington  Mr  Perelman declined to provide details about payments on those pledges  He also gave a total of  16 million to 581 nonprofit organizations  including Big Brothers Big Sisters  in Philadelphia  the Michael J  Fox Foundation for Parkinson s Research  in New York  the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  in Baltimore  the Rainforest Foundation U S   in New York  and other arts  education  Jewish  medical research  and women s health groups  Mr  Perelman serves as a member of the Board of Directors of the Police Athletic League of New York City  a nonprofit youth development agency serving inner city children and teenagers  On June 3  2011  Perelman was honored for his charitable contributions at the New York Police Foundation s 40th Anniversary Gala  31 at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City   an event that raised  2 3 million for charity  In 2006 alone  he donated over  60 million to various charitable groups and causes including Carnegie Hall and the World Trade Center Memorial  32  Other notable donations include  20 million to the University of Pennsylvania for naming rights to the quadrangle  33   10 million to New York University to create the Ronald O  Perelman Department of Dermatology  30   4 7 million to Princeton University to create the Ronald Perelman Institute for Jewish Studies  34  and  20 million to the Guggenheim Museum  35   Ronald Perelman s parents  Raymond and Ruth  are also deeply dedicated to philanthropy  in 2011  they donated  225 million to the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine 36    the largest single donation to that university in its history  changing the school s name to the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania  His mother  Ruth  passed away on July 31  2011 at age 90 in Philadelphia   edit  Cigars The phrase  cigar chomping  tends to appear anywhere the name Ronald Perelman is written and with good reason  37  38  39  Perelman first lit up when he was 26 years old  Trapped in a meeting that refused to end  he noticed a lawyer named Laddie Montague light up a cigar and start happily puffing away  Perelman asked if he could try one  40  From that day until he quit in 1999  41  he smoked between one and five cigars a day  42  Perelman had Consolidated Cigar manufacture a custom 38 ring H  Upmann style cigar just for him  40  43  The media speculated extensively about the exact reason he quit  New York magazine claimed his new wife  Ellen Barkin  made him quit  44  and Forbes suggested he quit because he sold Consolidated Cigar  41  Perelman set the record straight in an interview with Institutional Investor  he quit at the encouragement of his youngest daughters  Samantha and Caleigh  with whom he lived  45   edit  Judaism Judaism has had a strong influence on Perelman s life  He grew up in a Conservative household  46  and had a religious reawakening at the age of eighteen while on a family trip to Israel  21   I felt not just this enormous pride at being a Jew  I felt this enormous void at not being a better Jew  So I decided then to begin being a better Jew  As soon as I got married  we kept a kosher house  we became much more observant  We moved to New York shortly thereafter and joined an Orthodox synagogue and the kids grew up with much more Judaism surrounding them than I ever did   21  Today  he strictly observes the Jewish Sabbath  spends three hours every Saturday in prayer  47  keeps a kosher home  48  and donates millions to Jewish groups and causes  particularly the Chabad Lubavitch sect  47  He does not consider himself to be a member of Lubavitch  He supports them because he thinks they are Judaism s best chance for surviving and thriving in modern society  21   edit  Business  edit  Belmont Industries Perelman s first major business deal took in 1961 during his Freshman year at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania  He and his father bought the Esslinger Brewery for  800 000  then sold it three years later for a  1 million profit  49  Throughout Perelman s tenure at the Belmont Iron Works  later renamed Belmont Industries  he assisted his father on many other deals  earning millions of dollars in the process  Their general strategy was one Perelman would follow for the rest of his life  Purchase a company  sell off superfluous divisions to reduce debt and generate profit  bring the company back to its core business  and either sell it or hang onto it for cash flow  In 1978  twelve years after Perelman formally joined Belmont Industries  he was the vice president but he still strove for more power and influence in the company  Raymond told him that he had no intention of stepping down anytime soon  Perelman resigned and moved to New York  The two barely spoke to one another for the next six years  50   edit  On his own See main article  MacAndrews  amp  Forbes He orchestrated the purchase of Cohen Hatfield Jewelers in 1978  his first deal as an independent investor free of his father s influence  He recognized the enormous value of Hatfield s mismanaged jewelry cache and bought control of the company with a  1 9 million loan from his wife  Faith Golding  Within a year  Perelman had sold all of company s retail locations and reduced the company to its lucrative wholesale jewelry division  earning him  15 million  51  His next target was MacAndrews  amp  Forbes  a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate  The management and investors repeatedly rebuffed his efforts to purchase the company and filed an unsuccessful lawsuit to prevent the acquisition  but Perelman prevailed  That his father had tried and failed to acquire it 10 years earlier made his success particularly sweet  52  MacAndrews  amp  Forbes has become a holding company with interests in a diversified portfolio of public and private companies  Wholly owned by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ronald O  Perelman  MacAndrews  amp  Forbes Holdings Inc  invests in companies with strong market positions  recognized brands and growth potential  Current holdings include leading participants across a wide range of industries  from cosmetics and entertainment to biotechnology and military equipment  including AM General 53   Deluxe 54   Fanueil 55   Revlon 56   Scientific Games 57   SIGA Technologies 58  and TransTech Pharma 59   He has done dozens of deals with Revlon Corporation 60   thrifts for  315 million and renamed it First Gibraltar Bank  61  62   Marvel Entertainment Group 63   Coleman Company  Sunbeam Products 64   New World Entertainment 65  The story of Perelman s Marvel adventures were caricatured in Titans of Finance  Alternative Comics  2001  ISBN 1891867059  66  by R  Walker and Josh Neufeld  67  a comic book collaboration between a cartoonist and a finance columnist  which casts Wall Street executives and traders as heroes and villains  The lead story features Perelman  with Mike Vranos  Al Dunlap  and Victor Niederhoffer among those included   edit  Morgan Stanley On February 17  2005  Perelman filed a lawsuit against Morgan Stanley  68  Two facts were at issue  Did Morgan Stanley know about the problems with Sunbeam and was Ronald Perelman misled  During the discovery phase  the judge became exasperated with what she perceived as deliberate stonewalling on the part of Morgan Stanley and ordered the jury to assume Morgan Stanley deliberately and knowingly defrauded Perelman  69  Hobbled  Morgan Stanley had no choice but to argue that Perelman was too savvy an investor to have fallen for their transparent tricks  70  After a five week trial  the jury deliberated for two days  found in favor of Perelman  and awarded him  1 45 billion  71  The damages stung particularly because Morgan Stanley passed up Perelman s offer to settle the case for  20 million  72  Morgan Stanley maintained that the court case was improperly decided  citing the judge s decision to use Florida law over New York law and her decision to order the jury to consider Morgan Stanley guilty before the trial began  73  In 2007  the courts of appeal reversed the judgement  The judges  declared Perelman hadn t provided any evidence showing he d suffered any actual damage as a result of Morgan Stanley s actions  Perelman appealed  74  but found himself shot down by the Florida Supreme Court who dismissed it in a 5 0 decision  75  Undeterred even after that setback  Perelman went back to the trial court and asked for the case to be reopened because the hiding of email evidence was  a classic example of fraud on the court   The trial court rejected his arguments  but as of January 2009  he is beseeching Florida s 4th Circuit to reopen the case  76   edit  Controversy  edit  Greenmail In the late 1980s  Perelman was repeatedly accused of engaging in greenmail  45   Greenmail  is when someone buys a large block of a company s stock and threatens to take over the company unless he is paid a substantial premium over his purchase price  In the case of someone such as Perelman or Carl Icahn with a reputation as a corporate raider  the mere act of buying up shares could send a company into a panic and investors into a buying frenzy  77  Perelman insists he seriously intended to buy every corporation he bought into  78  He was first accused of greenmail in late 1986 during a run at CPC International when he bought 8 2  of CPC at around  75 a share and indirectly sold it back to CPC through Salomon Brothers a month later at 88 5 a share for a  40 million profit  Both CPC and Perelman denied it was greenmail despite appearances to the contrary  including what looked like an artificial price increase by Salomon shortly before they sold Perelman s shares  79  Transworld  a company Perelman already held 15  of  was spooked by his taking of greenmail and instituted a variety of anti takeover measures while preemptively putting themselves up onto the auction block to avoid a Perelman takeover  77  Whatever his intentions may have been  he never acted on them  As a part of Transworld s restructuring in 1988  he sold his stake  77  The third charge of greenmailing levied against him was the best known and stemmed from his attempt to purchase Gillette in November 1986  Perelman opened negotiations with a bid of  4 12 billion  Gillette responded with an unsuccessful lawsuit and public insinuations of insider trading  Perelman accumulated 13 8  of Gillette before he made what he would later call the worst decision he ever made and sold his stake to Gillette later that month for a  34 million profit  Gillette had put word out that Ralston Purina had agreed to buy a 20  block of stock  making any attempt by Perelman to buy Gillette much more difficult  Perelman decided to sell his share to Ralston Purina  but before he did so Gillette s executives called him up  asking if he d sell his shares to them and they d sell the shares to Ralston Purina  He sold his shares to Gillette  Ralston backed out of the deal  and Perelman was left feeling a little foolish for having been tricked into taking greenmail  40  Undeterred by the agreement he signed declaring he wouldn t attempt a hostile takeover of Gillette for at least 10 years  he waited until June 1987 to attempt a friendly takeover  Opening bidding at  4 66 billion  Perelman gradually upped his bid over the following months to  5 7 billion to no avail  Gillette s management had no interest in selling  insisting they were worth at least  55 a share  80  In October 1987  Perelman finally gave up and withdrew his offer  81   edit  Monica Lewinsky Perelman stumbled into the Lewinsky scandal  In early 1998  Vernon Jordan recommended Monica Lewinsky to Perelman as a potential employee  pitching her as a very smart young woman  While Jordan was on the Revlon board of directors  Jordan rarely spoke to Perelman and had never recommended anyone to him  Jordan indicated he d already talked about Lewinsky with MacAndrews  amp  Forbes Holdings vice president  Jaymie Durnan  Durnan told Perelman that he had determined there was no position available for Lewinsky at Perelman s company  but that he had forwarded Lewinsky s resume to Revlon  Perelman claims to have been as surprised as anyone when he found out about the Lewinsky Clinton connection later that month  82  He found that Revlon had already made a job offer which was quickly withdrawn  but it was too late  Revlon and Perelman were all over the scandal  83   edit  Panavision In April 2001  M amp F Worldwide bought Perelman s 83  stake in Panavision for  128 million  This would be unremarkable except that Perelman controlled M amp F Worldwide and the price paid for his stake was four times market value  At the time  M amp F Worldwide was a healthy company with an excellent balance sheet while Panavision was bleeding red ink  M amp F Worldwide s other shareholders cried foul  alleging the only person who stood to benefit from the deal was Perelman and took their complaints to the courts  84  Perelman insisted the deal was an excellent one and in the best interest of the shareholders because Panavision was well positioned to profit from the move to digital cinematography  85  The share price tumbled from six to three after the deal and reflected M amp F Worldwide shareholders  lack of confidence  86  Perelman tried to pacify M amp F Worldwide s shareholders with a  15 million settlement  but the judge rejected it as grossly inadequate  Ultimately  Perelman agreed to undo the deal  87   edit  Fred Tepperman Perelman hired Fred Tepperman as his CFO after Tepperman left Warner Communications in 1985  Starting with Pantry Pride  Tepperman worked on every single business deal Perelman orchestrated throughout Tepperman s seven year stint at MacAndrews  amp  Forbes  Tepperman s tenure came to an abrupt end just after Christmas in 1991 when Perelman fired him for being derelict in his duties  Tepperman had been distracted for the past year by his Alzheimers afflicted wife of 30 years  He had been taking longer vacations  he kept shorter hours at the office that precluded Perelman s famous breakfast meetings  and he seemed generally distracted and distraught  According to Tepperman  Perelman once told him to not look sad in front of bankers because it made them nervous  A clause in Tepperman s contract entitled him to a large portion of his salary and benefits in the event of an injury that prevented him from being able to work  an injury which Tepperman claimed he had in fact suffered  albeit of a psychological nature  as a result of the effect his wife s condition had on him  His demands totaled up to  30 million  That number stems partially from Tepperman s salary  which started at  275 000 and rose to  1 2 million in 1990 88  and partially from his large benefits package  which included a luxury car of a brand of his choice  89  Perelman was quick to file a countersuit for fraud  claiming that Tepperman had sneakily changed the company s retirement plan in such a way that Tepperman would personally gain millions of dollars  88  It took over three years for the case to make it to court  Tepperman s attorney  Barry Slotnick  charged that the breakfast meetings were nothing but a podium Perelman used to boast about his sexual conquests  and thus Tepperman was merely avoiding pointless meetings  as any worker would  His long vacations were declared to not be an issue on account of telecommuting  he could do his job just as well in Florida as in New York  Perelman s attorney Stanley Arkin argued that Tepperman was unable to perform his job  had refused to accept this  and was justifiably fired  Stanley revealed earlier in the case that Tepperman was actually living with his wife s nurse  damaging his reputation as a devoted husband who was just looking out for his wife  Slotnick responded that his wife s family were aware of the arrangement  believing it necessary for Tepperman to move on with his life  The only witness to take the stand was Tepperman  who testified for six days  before the case ended with a sealed settlement  88   edit  Wealth He is the 25th richest American  and 64th richest person in the world  with an estimated wealth of USD 12 billion  90
