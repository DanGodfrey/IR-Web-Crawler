view talk edit Transgender    tr nz d  nd r   is a general term applied to a variety of individuals  behaviors  and groups involving tendencies to vary from culturally conventional gender roles  Transgender is the state of one s  gender identity   self identification as woman  man  neither or both  not matching one s  assigned sex   identification by others as male  female or intersex based on physical genetic sex   1   Transgender  does not imply any specific form of sexual orientation  transgender people may identify as heterosexual  homosexual  bisexual  pansexual  polysexual  or asexual  some may consider conventional sexual orientation labels inadequate or inapplicable to them  The precise definition for transgender remains in flux  but includes   Of  relating to  or designating a person whose identity does not conform unambiguously to conventional notions of male or female gender roles  but combines or moves between these   2   People who were assigned a sex  usually at birth and based on their genitals  but who feel that this is a false or incomplete description of themselves   3   Non identification with  or non presentation as  the sex  and assumed gender  one was assigned at birth   4  A transgender individual may have characteristics that are normally associated with a particular gender  identify elsewhere on the traditional gender continuum  or exist outside of it as  other    agender    Genderqueer   or  third gender   Transgender people may also identify as bigender  or along several places on either the traditional transgender continuum  or the more encompassing continuums which have been developed in response to the significantly more detailed studies done in recent years  5  Contents 1 Evolution of the term transgender 1

References 14 External links Evolution of the term transgender The term transgender  TG  was popularised in the 1970s 6   but implied in the 1960s 7  8   describing people who wanted to live cross gender without sex reassignment surgery  9  In the 1980s the term was expanded to an umbrella term  10  and became popular as a means of uniting all those whose gender identity did not mesh with their gender assigned at birth  11  In the 1990s  the term took on a political dimension 12  13  as an alliance covering all who have at some point not conformed to gender norms  and the term became used to question the validity of those norms 14  or pursue equal rights and anti discrimination legislation  15  16  leading to its widespread usage in the media  academic world and law  17  The term continues to evolve  Transgender vs  transsexual Billy Tipton was born in 1914  He began living as a man full time by 1940 at age 26  had a career as a jazz and swing pianist and entertainer  a common law marriage  unregistered but publicly accepted   and three sons by adoption  He was discovered to have been female bodied after he died in 1989 due to a hemorrhaging ulcer  that he refused to have treated   Like many female to male transsexuals of his day he did not have genital surgery  The word transsexual  unlike the word transgender  originated in the medical and psychological communities  1  18  It was defined by Harry Benjamin in his seminal book The Transsexual Phenomenon  18  In particular he defined transsexuals on a scale called the  Benjamin Scale   which defines a few different levels of intensity of transsexualism  these are listed as  Transsexual  nonsurgical     True Transsexual  moderate intensity    and  True Transsexual  high intensity    18  Many transsexuals believe that to be a true transsexual  a person needs to have a desire for surgery   19  However  it is notable that Benjamin s moderate intensity  true transsexual  needs either estrogen or testosterone medication as a  substitute for or preliminary to operation   18  There also exist people who have had sexual reassignment surgery  SRS   but do not meet the definition of a transsexual  such as Gregory Hemingway  20  21  while other people do not desire SRS  yet clearly meet Dr  Benjamin s definition of a  true transsexual   such as Miriam Rivera  In addition to the larger categories of transgender and transsexual  there is a wide range of gender expressions and identities which are contrary to the mainstream male female binary  These include Cross dressers  drag queens  drag kings  transvestites  genderqueer  etc  Some transsexuals also take issue with the term because Charles  Virginia  Prince  the founder of the cross dressing organization Tri Ess and coiner of the term  transgender   22  took those actions because she wished to distinguish herself from transsexual people  In  Men Who Choose to Be Women   Prince wrote  I  at least  know the difference between sex and gender and have simply elected to change the latter and not the former   8  There is a substantial academic literature on the difference between sex and gender  but in pragmatic English  this distinction is often ignored  so that  gender  is used to describe the categorical male female difference and  sex  is used to describe the physical act of sexual intercourse  23  There is political tension between the identities that fall under the  transgender umbrella   For example  transsexual men and women who can pay for medical treatments  or who have institutional coverage for their treatment  are likely to be concerned with medical privacy and establishing a durable legal status as men and women later in life  Extending insurance coverage for medical care is a coherent issue in the intersection of transsexuality and economic class  Most of these issues can appeal even to conservatives  if framed in terms of an unusual sort of  maintenance  of traditional notions of gender for rare people who feel the need for medical treatments  Some trans people might express this by saying   I don t challenge the gender binary  I just started out on the wrong side of it   24  Transgender identities Albert Cashier  a trans man who served as a soldier in the US civil war  While people self identify as transgender  the transgender identity umbrella includes sometimes overlapping categories  These include transsexual  transvestite or cross dresser  genderqueer  androgyne  and bigender  25  Usually not included are transvestic fetishists  because it is considered to be a paraphilia rather than gender identification   and drag kings and drag queens  who are performers who cross dress for the purpose of entertaining  In an interview  celebrity drag queen RuPaul talked about society s ambivalence to the differences in the people who embody these terms   A friend of mine recently did the Oprah show about transgender youth   said RuPaul   It was obvious that we  as a culture  have a hard time trying to understand the difference between a drag queen  transsexual  and a transgender  person   yet we find it very easy to know the difference between the American baseball league and the National baseball league  when they are both so similar   26  These terms are explained below  The current definitions of transgender include all transsexual people  although this has been criticized   See below   Intersex people have genitalia or other physical sexual characteristics that do not conform to strict definitions of male and or female  but intersex people are not necessarily transgender  since they do not all disagree with their assigned sex at birth  Transgender and intersex issues often overlap  however  because they both challenge the notion of rigid definitions of sex and gender  The term trans man refers to female to male  FtM or F2M  transgender people  and trans woman refers to male to female  MtF or M2F  transgender people  In the past  it was assumed that there were more trans women than trans men  but a Swedish study estimated a ratio of 1 4 1 in favour of trans women for those requesting sex reassignment surgery and a ratio of 1 1 for those who proceeded  27  The term cisgender has been coined as an antonym referring to non transgender people  i e  those who identify with their gender assigned at birth  28  When referring to a transgender person  it is respectful to always use that person s preferred name and pronoun regardless of their legal gender status  as not all transgender people can afford surgery or other body modifications   The word  transgender  should be used as an adjective rather than a noun   for example   Max is transgender  or  Max is a transgender man  rather than  Max is a transgender   29  Transsexual Main article  Transsexualism Transsexual people identify as a member of the sex opposite to that assigned at birth  and desire to live and be accepted as such  30  31  Transsexual people may undergo gender transition  the process of aligning one s gender expression or presentation with their internal gender identity  People who have transitioned may or may not necessarily identify as transgender or transsexual any longer  but simply as a man or a woman  Those who continue identifying as transsexual men or women may not want to ignore their pre transition life  and may continue strong ties with other trans people and raising social consciousness  32  The process of transition may involve some kind of medical gender reassignment therapy and often  but not always  includes hormone replacement therapy and or sex reassignment surgery  References to  pre operative    post operative  and  non operative  transsexual people indicate whether they have had  or are planning to have sex reassignment surgery  although some trans people reject these terms as objectifying trans people based on their surgical status and not their mental gender identity  Transvestite or Cross Dresser Main article  Transvestism A transvestite is a person who cross dresses  or dresses in clothes of the opposite sex  33  34  The term  transvestite  is used as a synonym for the term  cross dresser   35  36  although  cross dresser  is generally considered the preferred term  36  37  The term  cross dresser  is not exactly defined in the relevant literature  Michael A  Gilbert  38  professor at the Department of Philosophy  York University  Toronto  offers this definition    A cross dresser  is a person who has an apparent gender identification with one sex  and who has and certainly has been birth designated as belonging to  that  sex  but who wears the clothing of the opposite sex because it is the clothing of the opposite sex   This excludes people  who wear opposite sex clothing for other reasons   such as  those female impersonators who look upon dressing as solely connected to their livelihood  actors undertaking roles  individual males and females enjoying a masquerade  and so on  These individuals are cross dressing but are not cross dressers   39  Cross dressers may not identify with  or want to be the opposite gender  nor adopt the behaviors or practices of the opposite gender  and generally do not want to change their bodies medically  The majority of cross dressers identify as heterosexual  40  People who cross dress in public can have a desire to pass as the opposite gender  so as not to be detected as a cross dresser  or may be indifferent  The term  transvestite  and the associated outdated term  transvestism  are conceptually different from the term  transvestic fetishism   as  transvestic fetishist  describes those who intermittently use clothing of the opposite gender for fetishistic purposes  41  42  In medical terms  transvestic fetishism is differentiated from cross dressing by use of the separate codes 302 3 42  in the DSM and F65 1 41  in the ICD  Genderqueer Main article  Genderqueer Genderqueer is a recent attempt to signify gender experiences that do not fit into binary concepts  and refers to a combination of gender identities and sexual orientations  One example could be a person whose gender presentation is sometimes perceived as male  sometimes female  but whose gender identity is female  gender expression is butch  and sexual orientation is lesbian  It suggests nonconformity or mixing of gender stereotypes  conjoining both gender and sexuality  43  and challenges existing constructions and identities  44  In the binary sex gender system  genderqueerness is unintelligible and abjected  45  Androgyne Main article  Androgyny An androgyne is a person who does not fit cleanly into the typical gender roles of their society  It does not imply any specific form of sexual orientation  Androgynes may identify as beyond gender  between genders  moving across genders  entirely genderless  or any or all of these  exhbiting a variety of male  female  and other characteristics  Androgyne identities include pangender  ambigender  non gendered  agender  Gender fluid or intergender  Androgyny can be either physical or psychological  and it does not depend on birth sex  Occasionally  people who do not define themselves as androgynes adapt their physical appearance to look androgynous  This outward androgyny has been used in fashion  and the milder forms of it  women wearing men s pants or men wearing two earrings  for example  are not seen as transgender behavior  The term androgyne is also sometimes used as a medical synonym for an intersex individual  46  Bigender Main article  Bigender A bigender  sometimes rendered as bi gender or bi gender  individual is one who moves between masculine and feminine gender roles  Such individuals move between two distinct personalities fluidly depending on context  While an androgynous person retains the same gender typed behaviour across situations  the bigendered person consciously or unconsciously changes their gender role behaviour from primarily masculine to primarily feminine  or vice versa  Drag kings and queens See also  Drag king  Drag queen  and Faux queen Drag is a term applied to clothing and make up worn on special occasions for performing or entertaining  This is in contrast to those who are transgender or who cross dress for other reasons  Drag performance also includes overall presentation and behavior in addition to clothing and makeup  Drag can be theatrical  comedic  or grotesque  Drag queens have been considered caricatures of women by second wave feminism  Drag artists have a long tradition in LGBT culture  Generally the terms drag queen covers men doing female drag  drag king covers women doing male drag  and faux queen covers women doing female drag  Nevertheless  there are drag artists of all genders and sexualities who perform for various reasons  Some drag performers  transvestites  and people in the gay community  have embraced the pornographically derived term tranny to describe drag queens or people who engage in transvestism or cross dressing  however this term is widely considered offensive if applied to transsexual people  47  Transgender people and the LGBT community See also  LGBT The neutrality of this section is disputed  Please see the discussion on the talk page  Please do not remove this message until the dispute is resolved   July 2009  The concepts of gender identity and transgender identity differ from that of sexual orientation  48  Sexual orientation describes an individual s enduring physical  romantic  emotional  and or spiritual attraction to another person  while gender identity is one s personal sense of being a man or a woman  29  Transgender people have more or less the same variety of sexual orientations as cisgender people  49  In the past  the terms homosexual and heterosexual were incorrectly used to label transgender individuals  sexual orientation based on their birth sex  50  Professional literature now uses terms such as attracted to men  androphilic   attracted to women  gynephilic   attracted to both or attracted to neither to describe a person s sexual orientation without reference to their gender identity  51  Therapists are coming to understand the necessity of using terms with respect to their clients  gender identities and preferences  52  For example  a person who is assigned male at birth  transitions to female  and is attracted to men would be identified as heterosexual  Despite the distinction between sexual orientation and gender  throughout history the gay  lesbian  and bisexual subculture was often the only place where gender variant people were socially accepted in the gender role they felt they belonged to  especially during the time when legal or medical transitioning was almost impossible  This acceptance has had a complex history  Like the wider world  the gay community in Western societies did not generally distinguish between sex and gender identity until the 1970s  and often perceived gender variant people more as homosexuals who behaved in a gender variant way than as gender variant people in their own right  Today  members of the transgender community often continue to struggle to remain part of the same movement as lesbian  gay and bisexual citizens  and to be included in rights protections  Pride symbols Main article  LGBT symbols The transgender pride flag A common symbol for the transgender community is the transgender pride flag  which was designed by Monica Helms  and was first shown at a pride parade in Phoenix  Arizona  United States in 2000  The flag consists of five horizontal stripes  two light blue  two pink  with a white stripe in the center  Monica describes the meaning of the flag as follows  The light blue is the traditional color for baby boys  pink is for girls  and the white in the middle is for those who are transitioning  those who feel they have a neutral gender or no gender  and those who are intersexed  The pattern is such that no matter which way you fly it  it will always be correct  This symbolizes us trying to find correctness in our own lives  Other transgender symbols include the butterfly  symbolizing transformation or metamorphosis   and a pink light blue yin and yang symbol  Transgender people and feminism Main article  Transfeminism This section requires expansion  Some feminists and feminist groups are supportive of transgender people  Others are not  Though second wave feminism argued for the sex and gender distinction  some feminists believed there was a conflict between transgender identity and the feminist cause  These feminists believed  for example  that male to female transition abandoned or devalued female identity  and that trangender people embraced traditional gender roles and stereotypes  Many transgender feminists  however  viewed themselves as contributing positively to feminism by questioning and subverting gender norms  Third wave and contemporary feminism have tended to be more accepting of transgender people  53  Feminist writer Janice Raymond asserts that sex determines gender  and that there is no practical difference between the two  In her view  genitalia or  birth sex  or chromosomes deeply and permanently determine one s essential identity as a woman or man  trying to violate this divide is impossible  unnatural  and unhealthy  She argues that while transpeople may claim to feel like a certain gender  only a biological female can genuinely feel what it is to occupy a woman s body  including having experiences such as childbirth  54  Transgender healthcare Main article  Transgender transition See also  Gender transitioning Mental healthcare This article has been nominated to be checked for its neutrality  Discussion of this nomination can be found on the talk page   November 2010  Therapy is recommended by most mental health professionals for those who suffer from internal conflicts regarding their gender identity or those who feel discomfort in their assigned gender role  especially if they desire to transition  People who experience discord between their gender and the expectations of others or whose gender identity conflicts with their body may benefit by talking through their feelings in depth with someone who will listen attentively  However  research on gender identity is relatively new to psychology and scientific understanding of it and related issues is still in its infancy  55  Transgender people may be eligible for diagnosis of gender identity disorder  GID   only if  being transgender  causes distress or disability   56  This distress is referred to as gender dysphoria and may manifest as depression or inability to work and form healthy relationships with others  This diagnosis is often misinterpreted as implying that simply being transgender means a person suffers from GID  which is not the case  This has caused much confusion to transgender people and those who seek to either criticize or affirm them  Transgender people who are comfortable with their gender  whose gender does not directly cause inner frustration or impair their functioning  do not suffer from GID  Moreover  GID is not necessarily permanent  and is often resolved through therapy and or transitioning  GID does not refer to people who feel oppressed by the negative attitudes and behaviors or others including legal entities in the same way that racist institutions do not create a  race disorder   Neither does GID imply an opinion of immorality  the psychological establishment holds the position that people with any kind of mental or emotional problem should not receive stigma  The solution for GID is whatever will alleviate suffering and restore functionality  this often  but not always  consists of undergoing a gender transition  55  The terms  transsexualism    dual role transvestism    gender identity disorder in adolescents or adults  and  gender identity disorder not otherwise specified  are listed as such in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases  ICD  or the American Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  DSM  under codes F64 0  F64 1  302 85 and 302 6 respectively  57  In February 2010  France became the first country in the world to remove transgender identity from the list of mental diseases  58  59  The issues around psychological classifications and associated stigma  whether based in paraphilia or not  of cross dressers  transsexual men and women  and for that matter lesbian and gay children who may be difficult to tell apart from trans children early in life  have recently become more complex since it was announced that CAMH colleagues Kenneth Zucker and Ray Blanchard would serve on the DSM V s Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders Work Group   60  CAMH aims to  cure  transgender people of their  disorder   especially in children  Within the trans community  this has mostly produced shock and outrage with attempts to organize other responses  61  One of the reasons there is so much controversy about Kenneth Zucker and Ray Blanchard s work group is that many people believe that gender identity disorders homosexuality are incurable as they are genetic and or occur as a result of events occurring before birth  therefore already  solidified  by the time of birth   If this is the case  then trying to  cure  said condition s  could lead  and in some individuals already has led 62  63  64   to increased confusion  more intense dysphoria later in life  and perhaps even suicide  likely due to the fact that the younger the transgender individual  the greater the effect of hormones   While some cases of individuals partaking in these sessions seem to show success  the long term repercussions  if any  of some of these individuals being  cured  have not yet been observed  due to an indefinite amount of time before negative reactions could possibly occur  Transgender issues are both new in the scientific field and affect relatively few people  so many mental healthcare providers know little about transgender issues  People seeking help from these professionals often end up educating the professional rather than receiving help  55  Among those therapists who profess to know about transgender issues  many believe that transitioning from one sex to another   the standard transsexual model   is the best or only solution  citation needed  This usually works well for those who are transsexual  but is not the solution for other transgender people  particularly genderqueer people who do not identify as exclusively male or female  Physical healthcare Medical and surgical procedures exist for transsexual and some transgender people   Most categories of transgender people as described above are not known for seeking the following treatments   Hormone replacement therapy for trans men induces beard growth and masculinises skin  hair  voice and fat distribution  Hormone replacement therapy for trans women feminises fat distribution and breasts  Laser hair removal or electrolysis removes excess hair for trans women  Surgical procedures for trans women feminise the voice  skin  face  adam s apple  breasts  waist  buttocks and genitals  Surgical procedures for trans men masculinise the chest and genitals and remove the womb and ovaries and fallopian tubes  The acronyms  GRS  and  SRS  refer to genital surgery  The term  sex reassignment therapy   SRT  is used as an umbrella term for physical procedures required for transition  Use of the term  sex change  has been criticized for its emphasis on surgery  and the term  transition  is preferred  1  65  Availability of these procedures depends on degree of gender dysphoria  presence or absence of gender identity disorder  66  and standards of care in the relevant jurisdiction  Transgender people and the law Dr  Camille Cabral  a transgender activist at a demonstration for transgender people in Paris  October 1  2005 Main article  Legal aspects of transsexualism Legal procedures exist in some jurisdictions allowing individuals to change their legal gender  or their name  to reflect their gender identity  Requirements for these procedures vary from an explicit formal diagnosis of transsexualism  to a diagnosis of gender identity disorder  to a letter from a physician attesting to the individual s gender transition  or the fact that one has established a different gender role  67  In 1994  the DSM IV entry was changed from  Transsexual  to  Gender Identity Disorder   In many places  transgender people are not legally protected from discrimination in the workplace or in public accommodations  68  A report released in February 2011 found that 90  of transgender people faced discrimination at work  and were unemployed at double the rate of the general population  Over half had been harassed or turned away when attempting to access public services  69  Members of the transgender community also encounter high levels of discrimination in health care on an everyday basis  70  In Canada  a private members bill protecting the rights of freedom of gender expression and gender identity passed in the House of Commons on February 9  2011  It amends the Canada Human Rights code to help protect gender variant people from discrimination by including gender identity and expression in the list of prohibited grounds for discrimination  as well as including gender identity and expression in the description of identifiable group  so that offences deliberately against gender variant people can be punished to a similar extent as a racial based crime  71  It is uncertain whether the bill will be passed by the Senate  72  In the U S   a federal bill to protect workers from discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity   called the Employment Non Discrimination Act   has stalled and failed several times over the past two decades  73  Still  individual states and cities have begun passing their own non discrimination ordinances  In New York  for example  Governor David Paterson passed the first legislation to include transgender protections in September 2010  74  Transgender people and religion The neutrality of this section is disputed  Please see the discussion on the talk page  Please do not remove this message until the dispute is resolved   November 2010  Main article  Religious views on transgender people The world s religions display great diversity and their interpretations of and reactions to transgender people demonstrate equal diversity  Even within one specific religion  Christianity  different groups have very different interpretations of gender identity and socio cultural gender roles as well as very different attitudes toward and reactions to transgender people  see the main article on this topic   More generally the scriptures of Abrahamic religions include both texts 75  sometimes interpreted as condemning transgender persons as well as texts 76  77  78  79  sometimes interpreted as challenging conservative views of gender and of the possibilities open to transgender people  as well as offering them encouragement  support and hope  Transsexual people and science Main article  Causes of transsexualism Brain based studies Several studies have concentrated on whether sexually dimorphic brain structures in transsexuals are more similar to their preferred sex or to their birth sex  Researchers caution that there are known brain differences between homosexual and heterosexual persons and that the brain changes in response to hormone treatment  which many transsexuals use  In order to know what in the brain is related to what feature of the person  studies of more uniform groups give clearer results than do studies of more mixed groups  Androphilic MtF transsexuals Studies have consistently shown that specifically androphilic male to female transsexuals  sometimes confusingly called homosexual MtF transsexuals in studies  show a shift towards the female direction in brain anatomy  In 2009  a German team of radiologists led by Gizewski compared 12 androphilic transsexuals with 12 biological males and 12 biological females  Using functional magnetic resonance imaging  fMRI   they found that when shown erotica  the biological men responded in several brain regions that the biological women did not  and that the sample of androphilic transsexuals was shifted towards the female direction in brain responses  80  Rametti and colleagues used diffusion tensor imaging  DTI  to compare 18 androphilic male to female transsexuals with 19 gynephilic males and 19 typical  heterosexual  females  The androphilic transsexuals differed from both control groups in multiple brain areas  including the superior longitudinal fasciculus  the right anterior cingulum  the right forceps minor  and the right corticospinal tract  The study authors concluded that androphilic transsexuals are halfway between the patterns exhibited by male and female controls  81  Gynephilic MtF transsexuals Conversely  gynephilic male to female transsexuals also show differences in the brain from non transsexual males  but in a unique pattern different from being shifted in a female direction  Researchers of the Karolinska Institute of Stockholm used MRI to compare 24 gynephilic male to female transsexuals with 24 non transsexual male and 24 non transsexual female controls  None of the study participants were on hormone treatment  The researchers found sex typical differentiation between the MtF transsexuals and non transsexual males  and the non transsexual females  but the gynephilic transsexuals  displayed also singular features and differed from both control groups by having reduced thalamus and putamen volumes and elevated GM volumes in the right insular and inferior frontal cortex and an area covering the right angular gyrus   These researchers concluded that  Contrary to the primary hypothesis  no sex atypical features with signs of  feminization  were detected in the transsexual group    The present study does not support the dogma that  male to female transsexuals  have atypical sex dimorphism in the brain but confirms the previously reported sex differences  The observed differences between MtF TR and controls raise the question as to whether gender dysphoria may be associated with changes in multiple structures and involve a network  rather than a single nodal area    82  In Sweden  non androphilic transsexual women were tested when they were smelling odorous steroids  The results showed that the transsexual women demonstrated  a pattern of activation away from the biological sex  occupying an intermediate position with predominantly female like features    83  Anne Lawrence  a sexologist  physician  and self identified autogynephilic transsexual  has hypothesized that the desire by persons with autogynephilia  including some cross dressers and some transsexuals  to alter their body can be compared with apotemnophilia  alternately body integrity identity disorder if framed as an identity issue rather than a fetish   84  Explanations of the desire to transition based on libido  such as this  have been criticized by some transsexuals who argue that they are unscientific 85  or transphobic  86  Mixed samples of MtF transsexuals Several teams of researchers have examined the brains or brain functioning of MtF transsexuals  but without breaking down the samples into androphilic  or homosexual  and gynephilic  or autogynephilic or heterosexual  types  Such studies have yielded contradictory results  with some studies reporting differences between the  mixed groups of  MtF transsexuals and the non transsexual controls but with other studies finding no differences  One brain structure that was examined in MtF transsexuals because of having known sex difference is the corpus callosum  which is larger and of a different shape in men than in women  In 1991  a University of Texas team reported comparing the corpus callosa of 10 MtF transsexuals  10 FtM transsexuals  20 control males  and 20 control females  No significant differences were found  87  In a pair of reports  a Dutch team led by Swaab  examined the volume 88  and neuron count 89  in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis in six estrogen treated transsexuals and one pre treatment transsexual  They found the BSTc to be female shifted  smaller  among the transsexuals than among the male control subjects  A subsequent study by Swaab found that the BSTc becomes sexually dimorphic only in adulthood  suggesting that differentiation of the BSTc does not cause transsexualism  90  Rather  the difference in the BSTc might instead be the result of a  failure to develop a male like gender identity   p  1032   The BSTc has also been reported to be smaller in other sexually atypical populations unrelated to transsexualism  91  Another team of Dutch researchers examined the effects of cross gender hormone treatment on the brain in 8 male to female transsexuals and in 6 female to male transsexuals  finding that the hormones changed the sizes of the hypothalamus in a gender consistent manner  Treatment with male hormones shifted the hypothalamus towards the male direction in the same way as in male controls  and treatment with female hormones shifted the hypothalamus towards the female direction in the same way as female controls  92  A 2003 study by Haraldsen and colleagues compared the performance of 52 persons with Gender Identity Disorder  33 from Norway and 19 from the U S   with that of 29 control subjects on a series of tests that tap into the functioning of different parts of the brain and on which men and women perform differently  The people in the GID sample  were either homosexually attracted by males or females  n 38   by both  n 3  or by neither  n 9    No effects of transsexual status were detected  93  Johns Hopkins researchers in 2005 reported on another test of brain functioning using test performance  The study subjects included 27 MtF transsexuals and 16 control men  and the authors reported that no female typical patterns in cerebral lateralization or cognitive performance were found within the transsexual sample  94  In 2009  UCLA researchers used MRIs to examine a mixed sample of 24 non hormone treated male to female transsexuals  6 were androphilic  and 18 were gynephilic   comparing them with 30 non transsexual males and 30 non transsexual females  The results  revealed that regional gray matter variation in MTF transsexuals is more similar to the pattern found in men than in women   except for the  right putamen    They concluded that  These findings provide new evidence that transsexualism is associated with distinct cerebral pattern  which supports the assumption that brain anatomy plays a role in gender identity   95  Gynephilic FtM transsexuals Brain based research has repeatedly shown that female to male transsexuals have several male like characteristics in neuroanatomy  In 2010  a team of neuroscientists compared 18 female to male transsexuals with 24 male and 19 female gynephilic controls  using an MRI technique called diffusion tensor imaging or DTI  96  DTI is a specialized technique for visualizing white matter of the brain  and white matter structure is one of the differences in neuroanatomy between men and women  The study found that the white matter pattern in female to male transsexuals was shifted in the direction of biological males  even before the female to male transsexuals started taking male hormones  which can also modify brain structure   Another team of neuroscientists  led by Nawata in Japan  used a technique called single photon emission computed tomography  SPECT  compare the regional cerebral blood flow  rCBF  of 11 female to male transsexuals  attracted to women  with that of 9 biological females  attracted to men   Although the study did not include a sample of biological males so that a conclusion of  male shift  could be made  the study did reveal that the female to male transsexuals showed significant decrease in blood flow in the left anterior cingulate cortex and a significant increase in the right insula  two brain regions known to respond during sexual arousal  97  Genetic studies In 2008  a study was performed to attempt to find a link between genes and transsexuality  The researchers compared 112 male to female transsexuals  both androphilic and gynephilic   mostly already undergoing hormone treatment  with 258 cis gendered male controls  The male to female transsexuals were more likely than non transsexual males to have a longer version of a receptor gene for the sex hormone androgen or testosterone  The research suggests reduced androgen and androgen signaling contributes to the female gender identity of male to female transsexuals  The authors say that it is possible that a decrease in testosterone levels in the brain during development might result in incomplete masculinization of the brain in male to female transsexuals  resulting in a more feminized brain and a female gender identity  98  99  Terms and Typology Main article  Androphilia and gynephilia The use of homosexual transsexual and related terms have been applied to transgender people since the middle of the 20th century  though concerns about the terms have been voiced since then  Harry Benjamin said in 1966      it seems evident that the question  Is the transsexual homosexual   must be answered  yes  and   no    Yes   if his anatomy is considered   no  if his psyche is given preference  What would be the situation after corrective surgery has been performed and the sex anatomy now resembles that of a woman  Is the  new woman  still a homosexual man   Yes   if pedantry and technicalities prevail   No  if reason and common sense are applied and if the respective patient is treated as an individual and not as a rubber stamp  100  Many sources  including some supporters of the typology  criticize this choice of wording as confusing and degrading  Biologist Bruce Bagemihl writes    the point of reference for  heterosexual  or  homosexual  orientation in this nomenclature is solely the individual s genetic sex prior to reassignment  see for example  Blanchard et al  1987 24   Coleman and Bockting  1988 25   Blanchard  1989 26    These labels thereby ignore the individual s personal sense of gender identity taking precedence over biological sex  rather than the other way around   101  Bagemihl goes on to take issue with the way this terminology makes it easy to claim transsexuals are really homosexual males seeking to escape from stigma  101  Leavitt and Berger stated in 1990 that  The homosexual transsexual label is both confusing and controversial among males seeking sex reassignment  102  103  Critics argue that the term  homosexual transsexual  is  heterosexist   101   archaic   104  and demeaning because it labels people by sex assigned at birth instead of their gender identity  105  Benjamin  Leavitt  and Berger have all used the term in their own work  100  102  Sexologist John Bancroft also recently expressed regret for having used this terminology  which was standard when he used it  to refer to transsexual women  106  He says that he now tries to choose his words more sensitively  106  106  Sexologist Charles Allen Moser is likewise critical of the terminology  107  Use of androphilia and gynephilia was proposed and popularized by psychologist Ron Langevin in the 1980s  108  Psychologist Stephen T  Wegener writes   Langevin makes several concrete suggestions regarding the language used to describe sexual anomalies  For example  he proposes the terms gynephilic and androphilic to indicate the type of partner preferred regardless of an individual s gender identity or dress  Those who are writing and researching in this area would do well to adopt his clear and concise vocabulary   109  Psychiatrist Anil Aggrawal explains why the terms are useful in a glossary  Androphilia   The romantic and or sexual attraction to adult males  The term  along with gynephilia  is needed to overcome immense difficulties in characterizing the sexual orientation of transmen and transwomen  For instance  it is difficult to decide whether a transman erotically attracted to males is a heterosexual female or a homosexual male  or a transwoman erotically attracted to females is a heterosexual male or a lesbian female  Any attempt to classify them may not only cause confusion but arouse offense among the affected subjects  In such cases  while defining sexual attraction  it is best to focus on the object of their attraction rather than on the sex or gender of the subject  110  Sexologist Milton Diamond  who prefers the correctly formed term gynecophilia  writes   The terms heterosexual  homosexual  and bisexual are better used as adjectives  not nouns  and are better applied to behaviors  not people  Diamond has encouraged using the terms androphilic  gynecophilic  and ambiphilic to describe the sexual erotic partners on prefers  andro   male  gyneco   female  ambi   both  philic   to love   Such terms obviate the need to specify the subject and focus instead on the desired partner  This usage is particularly advantageous when discussing the partners of transsexual or intersexed individuals  These newer terms also do not carry the social weight of the former ones   111  Psychologist Rachel Ann Heath writes   The terms homosexual and heterosexual are awkward  especially when the former is used with  or instead of  gay and lesbian  Alternatively  I use gynephilic and androphilic to refer to sexual preference for women and men  respectively  Gynephilic and androphilic derive from the Greek meaning love of a woman and love of a man respectively  So a gynephilic man is a man who likes women  that is  a heterosexual man  whereas an androphilic man is a man who likes men  that is  a gay man  For completeness  a lesbian is a gynephilic woman  a woman who likes other women  Gynephilic transsexed woman refers to a woman of transsexual background whose sexual preference is for women  Unless homosexual and heterosexual are more readily understood terms in a given context  this more precise terminology will be used throughout the book  Since homosexual  gay  and lesbian are often associated with bigotry and exclusion in many societies  the emphasis on sexual affiliation is both appropriate and socially just   112  Author Helen Boyd agrees  writing   It would be much more accurate to define sexual orientation as either  androphilic   loving men  and  gynephilic   loving women  instead   113  Sociomedical scientist Rebecca Jordan Young challenges researchers like Simon LeVay  J  Michael Bailey  and Martin Lalumiere  who she says  have completely failed to appreciate the implications of alternative ways of framing sexual orientation   114  Blanchard s typology Blanchard s transsexualism typology characterizes trans women as having one of two motivations for transition  115  116  117  Whereas previous descriptions of transgenderism included very many combinations of sexual orientation  gender identity  and the desire to cross dress  Blanchard interprets his evidence as suggesting that there were only two basic phenomena  One phenomenon was androphilia  male homosexuality   which ranged from typical gay men to  when extreme  androphilic or homosexual transsexualism  The other phenomenon was autogynephilia  which ranged from typical cross dressers to  when extreme  autogynephilic transsexualism  or non homosexual transsexualism   Androphilic male to female transsexuals are characterized by sexual attraction to males and by overt and obvious femininity since childhood  whereas autogynephilic transsexuals are characterized by sexual attraction to females  or sometimes to females and males  or by asexuality  and whose presentations are internal and typically unremarkable until they choose to disclose them  typically later in life  There are community activists who dislike the theory  118  Scientific criticism of the theory includes papers from Veale  Nuttbrock  Moser  and others who argue that the theory is poorly representative of MTF transsexuals  non instructive  the experiments poorly controlled  or contradicted by other data  107  119  120  121  Many sources  including some supporters of the theory  criticize Blanchard s choice of wording as confusing or degrading  Also the DSM V workgroup has been quoted as saying   In contemporary clinical practice  sexual orientation per se plays only a minor role in treatment protocols or decisions  Also  changes as to the preferred gender of sex partner occur during or after treatment  DeCuypere  Janes   amp  Rubens  2005  Lawrence  2005  Schroder  amp  Carroll  1999   It can be difficult to assess sexual orientation in individuals with a GI diagnosis  as they preoperatively might give incorrect information in order to be approved for hormonal and surgical treatment  Lawrence  1999   Because sexual orientation subtyping is of interest to researchers in the field  it is recommended that reference to it be addressed in the text  but not as a specifier  It should also be assessed as a dimensional construct   122  Blanchard is a member of the DSM V Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders Work Group chaired by Kenneth J  Zucker  Though it has supporters  the transsexual community has for the most part vehemently rejected Blanchard s typology theory  Transgender

reassignment were processed  and the incidence data were calculated on the basis of this group  This means that the average annual frequency was 11 6 cases  The number of inhabitants in Sweden over 15 years of age increased during the study period from 6 5 million to 7 1 million  i e  there was a mean population of 6 8 million  12   which gives an annual incidence of request for sex reassignment of 0 17 per 100 000 inhabitants  The sex ratio  male female  is 1 4  1  To resolve the question of whether transsexualism increases or decreases  we divided the group into two 10 year periods  As can be seen from Table 1  not only do our results agree with the Swedish incidence data published in the 1970s  but also they remain remarkably stable over time  Separating from all applications the group with primary transsexualism yielded 188 cases  i e  9 4 cases annually  As is shown in Table 2  this corresponds to an incidence of primary transsexualism of 0 14 per 100 000 inhabitants over 15 years
