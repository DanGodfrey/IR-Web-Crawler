Affleck  is a blind lawyer who lives in New York City s Hell s Kitchen and runs a firm with his best friend Franklin  Foggy  Nelson  Jon Favreau   which only defends innocent people and does not require payment  As a child  Matt  Scott Terra  was blinded after toxic waste was spilled over his eyes while he was running away from home after discovering that his father  former boxer Jack  The Devil  Murdock  David Keith   had become an enforcer for a local mobster  The accident  however  also enhanced his other senses and gave him a sonar that allowed him to  see  through sonic vibrations  Matt uses his sharpened senses to train himself in martial arts  His father  blaming himself for his disability  stopped being an enforcer and went back to boxing  However  his new career was short lived and he was murdered after refusing to turn in a fixed fight by the same mobster that had employed him earlier  In order to avenge his father s death  Matt used his abilities to become a crime fighter known as  Daredevil   who operates in Hell s Kitchen  going after the criminals that escape the conventional means of justice  One day  Matt meets and falls in love with Elektra Natchios  Jennifer Garner   daughter of Nikolas Natchios  Erick Avari   a businessman that has dealings with Wilson Fisk  Michael Clarke Duncan   a rich executive who is also the Kingpin of New York City s Underworld  When Nikolas tries to bail on his dealings with Fisk  Fisk hires the Irish hitman Bullseye  Colin Farrell   who never misses a shot  to kill him  Daredevil tries to stop Bullseye  even causing him to miss a shot  but Bullseye ultimately succeeds in killing Nikolas and framing Daredevil in the process  As a result  Elektra swears to take revenge on him as reporter Ben Urich  Joe Pantoliano   who had been investigating Daredevil s activities  discovers his secret identity  Believing Daredevil to have done good things for Hell s Kitchen  he tells Matt that Bullseye will be going after Elektra next  Daredevil goes after Bullseye  but is attacked by Elektra  who plans to use her extensive training in martial arts to avenge her father s death by killing Daredevil  After wounding him  she removes his mask  and discovers his secret identity and innocence of her father s death  Forced to fight Bullseye alone  Elektra is overpowered and murdered by the hitman  who is forced to flee before he can kill Daredevil as the police arrive  having been tipped off by Urich  Matt  wounded  makes his way to a local church  where he is looked after by his confidant Father Everett  Derrick O Connor   who knows his secret identity  After slightly recovering  Daredevil fights Bullseye  who had followed him to the church  After a violent battle  Bullseye discovers that loud noise is Daredevil s weakness and prepares to kill him with a spiked piece of wood after incapacitating him  Daredevil blocks the attack and hears an FBI sniper stationed on the neighbor building preparing to fire  As the bullet is fired  Daredevil moves out of the path of the bullet and pulls Bullseye s hands into the path of the bullet  Wounded  Bullseye pleads for mercy  but is overpowered by Daredevil and thrown from the church s top floor  He lands on the hood of a car  wounded but alive  Upon discovering that Fisk is the Kingpin and Bullseye s employer  Daredevil makes his way to his office  where they fight  In the process  Matt discovers that Fisk was the thug that killed his father many years before  He finds the strength to overpower Fisk  but refrains from killing him  instead allowing him to be arrested by the police  Before being taken away  Fisk   who had also discovered Daredevil s secret identity   swears revenge on Matt  but Matt taunts him that he can t reveal his secret identity  for the humiliation of being beaten down by a blind man  and that Matt will be waiting for him when he gets out of prison  Having taken down the Kingpin and gained some closure over his father s murder  Matt goes back to his day to day routine  though brokenhearted over the loss of Elektra  His strength is renewed at the possibility that Elektra might still be alive after he goes to where they had their first kiss and finds a necklace like the one her mother gave her  except with a Braille inscription  Matt meets Urich one last time  in which Urich assures him that he will not publish his article about Matt s true identity  and Daredevil dives into the night  forever the  Man Without Fear   During the credits  Bullseye  having been moved to a prison hospital and severely bandaged up after his confrontation with Daredevil  is shown to still have his perfect aim despite his injuries after he impales a fly on the wall with a nearby syringe needle   edit  Cast Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock   Daredevil  An attorney at law with a disability  He was blinded as a youth in an accident with bio waste that also drastically heightened his remaining senses and gave him a  sonar sense   which allowed him to perceive his surroundings  After this  he makes a silent promise with his father to  stick up for the long shots   His father is killed not long after and at that moment  he vows to seek justice  At night  Matt becomes Daredevil  and takes justice into his hands  Affleck was cast in October 2001  Vin Diesel was considered to portray Daredevil before him  but he opted to take a role in another film  1  In a February 2011 interview  Guy Pearce said that he was offered the role but turned it down  stating that  comic strip stuff isn t really my cup of tea  really   2 Matt Damon also revealed that he was offered the role  He claimed that he and Ben  loved that comic book but I just didn t quite believe in the script or the director at the time   3 Colin Farrell was also considered until Affleck signed  4  As a fan  Affleck made sure he had read every single issue of Daredevil  commenting that it was about taking what he knew as a fan and faithfully getting it on the screen  Joe Quesada considered it  serendipity in action  that Affleck is the lead role  as when he and Kevin Smith did the Guardian Devil series  they had modelled it on Affleck  5  Affleck said Daredevil was his favorite comic book as a kid  6  and explained why he took the role by saying  Everybody has that one thing from childhood that they remember and that sticks with them  This story was that for me   7  He also stated another reason  being  I didn t want someone else to do it  because I was afraid that they would go out and do it different from the comic and screw it up   8  Scott Terra as Young Matt Murdock  As a youth  he has trouble with local bullies and a close bond with his father  This changes in different ways after the accident  Terra was officially announced as a part of the cast in March 2002  9  Jennifer Garner as Elektra Natchios  Daughter of billionaire Nikolas Natchios and the love interest of Matt Murdock  At a very young age she witnessed the murder of her mother  and since then her father has had her become highly trained in martial arts  For the role of Elektra  many actresses were looked into with considerations including Pen lope Cruz  Salma Hayek  Natalie Portman  Lucy Liu  Jessica Alba  and Katie Holmes  10  A short list was eventually made  giving the choices of Jennifer Garner  Jolene Blalock  M a Maestro and Rhona Mitra  11  with Garner finally becoming the actress to land the role  10  Garner said of the character   I think she s strong and cool and beautiful and smart  She d be a good role model   12  Garner noted that the costume would be different as Elektra often wears red satin  but in the film she wears black leather  Garner explained  the red would never have worked for hiding a harness  and I know this sounds ridiculous  but you have to protect your skin a little bit  They throw me around so much on the rooftop  that  I got cut through the leather  so imagine if I hadn t had anything   8  Colin Farrell as Bullseye  One of the two co antagonists of the film  an assassin with perfect accuracy and deep rooted pride of it  Bullseye is hired by Kingpin to kill Nikolas and Elektra Natchios  but when Daredevil gets involved and causes Bullseye to miss his target  he makes it his own personal vendetta to take Daredevil down  Farrell was attached to the role in December 2001  4  Mark Steven Johnson credits Joe Quesada with talking him out of using the traditional Bullseye costume for the film  5  and Farrell was encouraged to keep his Irish accent as this version of Bullseye is from Ireland  8  Farrell had to read Frank Miller s Daredevil comics to understand Bullseye  because the expression on the character s faces in the comic books  and just the way they move sometimes  and the exaggerations of the character I m playing     he s so over the top that you do draw from that  But it s not exactly a character you can do method acting for    you know  running around New York killing people with paper clips   13  Michael Clarke Duncan as Wilson Fisk   The Kingpin  The second of the two co antagonists of the film  By appearance  he is an overweight corporate head that takes the name Wilson Fisk  but in fact he is the sole person running organized crime  under the moniker of Kingpin  Kingpin is the murderer of Matt s father  and the man responsible for the hiring of Bullseye  with intention of having the Natchios family murdered  Michael Clarke Duncan signed on for the role in January 2002  though he had been attached far earlier  14  When Duncan was cast  he weighed 290 pounds  He was asked to gain 40 pounds for the role in order to fit the physique of Kingpin  In order to do this  he would lift weights for 30 minutes a day  and power lifted with one or two reps a day  as well as eating whatever he wanted  Despite this  Duncan s biggest concern was that he is black  whilst Kingpin has always been portrayed as white  Also  Duncan provided the voice for Kingpin in Spider Man  The New Animated Series  15  He spoke on the fan s loyalty to the source material by saying  they watch movies to say   Hey  that s not like the comic book   But I want them to get past that and just see the movie for what it is and see me for what I am an actor   8  Jon Favreau as Franklin  Foggy  Nelson  Matt Murdock s legal partner and best friend  he is also used as a form of comic relief  Favreau joined the cast in February 2002  16  Favreau would later go onto direct the Marvel produced Iron Man and its sequel  Iron Man 2 while also appearing as Happy Hogan  Joe Pantoliano as Ben Urich  An investigative journalist whose articles notably relate to Daredevil  and the Kingpin  During the film  he goes on to uncover a lot of information about the two  Pantoliano was cast in March 2002  17  David Keith as Jack Murdock  Father of Matt Murdock and a boxer  he is murdered by the Kingpin when he does not take a fall for a fight  Keith was officially announced as a part of the cast in March 2002  9  Leland Orser as Wesley Owen Welch  The number two of Wilson Fisk  but he does not like to be involved in the activities of the Kingpin  Erick Avari as Nikolas Natchios  The father of Elektra  who is murdered by Bullseye on behalf of the Kingpin  Ellen Pompeo as Karen Page  The secretary at Matt Murdock and Franklin Nelson s law firm  Derrick O Connor as Father Everett  A priest of Matt Murdock s local church  where he sometimes goes to find solace  Stan Lee  Frank Miller  and Kevin Smith  each notable for their work on the Daredevil comics  also have cameo roles throughout the film  8  The director s cut version also features Jude Ciccolella and Coolio in a sub plot removed from the theatrical version  Tanoai Reed appears uncredited as a thug in the Pool Hall   edit  Production In 1997  20th Century Fox optioned the rights from Marvel Enterprises  and Chris Columbus was chosen to direct the film  In 1998  Marvel was facing bankruptcy  During this time 20th Century Fox allowed the option to expire  so Disney began negotiations in order to acquire the rights  In 1999  the negotiations failed to work out so Marvel sets the project up with Sony s Columbia Pictures  18  During this time  Chris Columbus and Carlo Carlei co wrote a script together  19  before Mark Steven Johnson got signed to write the screenplay  By 2000  Sony decided to cancel the project  18  as the two companies reportedly could not come to an agreement over Internet rights  20  New Regency entered negotiations with a more satisfying offer  attaining the character rights from Marvel in 2000 to produce the film  with 20th Century Fox handling the distribution  21  Mark Steven Johnson was rehired and his script was turned in during 2001  which was praised by Ain t It Cool News  Harry Knowles  18  22  Prior to shooting  producer Gary Foster said that in comparison to other comic book based films before it  this film would be  more character driven     darker     edgier   23  whilst Marvel Studios Executive Kevin Feige felt the script was one of the strongest comic scripts Marvel had received  24  20th Century Fox wanted to start filming in Canada in order to save money  This plan was contended by Johnson  and the film s cinematographer  Ericson Core  after they found a preferred area for shooting around downtown Los Angeles  Arcade Building  Core noted that the appeal came from the  beautiful  old brick buildings and great rooftops   which they felt was perfect for a depiction of Hell s Kitchen  Manhattan  in comparison to the studio s choice where the filming would be done in Montreal or Vancouver  Due to their insistence  coupled with Ben Affleck s disinterest in filming in Canada  after having filmed there for his previous film  The Sum of All Fears  they were able to overturn the studio s mind  25  A side by side view of the scene from the Guardian Devil graphic novel  and the film  Several scenes were taken shot for shot of comic books  When the look of the film was being decided  Mark Steven Johnson opted to use direct scenes from the Daredevil comics  Joe Quesada s artistic take in Guardian Devil  Daredevil  vol  2   1  8  was an influence on the film  with Johnson noting that they would  literally take out a scene from the comic book that Joe did     Here s Daredevil on the cross  you know  it s that scene from  Guardian Devil   You just shoot that   5  Throughout the film  Ben Affleck had to wear  cataract milky blue  contacts  which would effectively make him blind  This was considered great by Johnson  as it would aid his performance  26  The sound plays an integral part in the film  as the superhero relies on it in order to form his  sonar sense   Post production sound was done by supervising sound editor John Larsen and sound designer Steve Boeddeker and is heard taking place immediately after Matt s optic nerve is seen mutating  The mutating of the nerve was done by Rhythm and Hues Studios  who also worked on the sonar sense which became referred to as  shadow world   Shadow world was made using just CGI except in a scene where Elektra and Matt Murdock are in the rain  the scene was done using CGI over film  26  The score to Daredevil was written by Graeme Revell  and was released on March 4  2003  27  He was attracted to the focus of  human ness  on the Daredevil  torn emotionally and physically by his superhero status  Avi Arad asked Revell to concentrate more on the emotions of Daredevil and Elektra  whilst Mark Steven Johnson wanted to stay clear from any gothic and action movie clich s  Revell tried to avoid too much individual motifs but some characters would have an identifiable sound  like Bullseye would have guitar undertones  while Kingpin would have bass beats  Guitarist Mike Einziger of Incubus collaborated with Revell for any additional rock elements  Revell thoroughly enjoyed working with Johnson  describing the director as  positive  and  responsive  when it came to experimenting  as opposed to feeling  locked in a box of preconceptions   which he felt lead to  cool stuff   Var se Sarabande put together the score record  28   edit  Release  edit  Marketing Aside from expected TV commercials during such TV hits as Friends and Law  amp  Order  as well as one in the second quarter of the Super Bowl  there was also a tie in with Kraft  an in store promotion at Wal Mart  a marketing campaign with Hamilton Watch Company  who designed the watch Matt wears in the film  29  and a weeklong Daredevil segment on Entertainment Tonight  30  As part of an online form of marketing  a viral e mail drive was started  where participants would be entered in a contest where they could win prizes such as Daredevil t shirts  Game Boy Advance games  and cufflinks  To enter the drawing  the user had to book tickets for the film online  then pass an e mail on to someone else  The idea was to encourage online ticket booking  which at the time was seen as a growing trend  31  The Game Boy Advance game was released on February 14  2003  and was created by Encore  a subsidiary of Navarre Corporation  32  The soundtrack to the film  Daredevil  The Album  was released in February 2003  33   edit  Box office Daredevil opened theatrically on February 14  2003  on 3 471 screens  18  The film took first place in its opening weekend  grossing  45 033 454  At the time  it became the second biggest February release  behind Hannibal  34  By the second weekend the film saw a 55 1  decline in takings but managed to maintain the number one spot  beating new release Old School by  639 093  35  By the third weekend release  Daredevil saw a further 38 5  drop in sales  and so fell to third place at the box office  36  The film grossed over  102 million in North America  and over  76 million in the rest of the world  totalling the film s worldwide takings at just over  179 million  grossing over double its budget of  78 million  37 Avi Arad addressed the top spot success by saying  we are five for five with record breaking box office successes  with Blade  X Men  Blade II then Spider Man  and have two more Marvel releases slated for this summer  which are X2 and Hulk   It s a testament to the broad appeal of these characters before mainstream audiences outside of the core comic fans  These super heroes have been successful within the Marvel pantheon for decades  it only makes sense that their translations to the big screen are just as fruitful   38  Due to the film s violent scenes  Daredevil was banned in Malaysia  20th Century Fox had appealed to Malaysia s censorship board to change its decision  hoping that the film would be due for release in Malaysia on February 27  2003  39  Malaysian newspaper The Star also noted that the ban was due to the film theme being  focused on the dealings of a secret society   as well as some sensuality  The article criticized the Film Censorship Board of Malaysia for having these reasons to ban the film  but at the same time allowing films such as Final Destination 2  which contained violent content  and Infernal Affairs  which focused on the dealings of a secret society  before suggesting that the board should have considered banning The Lord of the Rings  The Two Towers for  having scenes containing violence using weapons and hands   a direct quotation of which the article cited as being another reason why Daredevil was banned  40   edit  Reception Daredevil received mixed reviews from critics  41  42  Review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 45  of critics gave the film positive feedback  based on 211 reviews  41  with a 26  rating from 34 selected  top critics   43  At the website Metacritic  which assigns its own subjective rating out of 100 to each review  the film has received an average score of 42  based on 35 reviews  42 Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of a possible 4 stars and called the film good  despite noting the almost typical superhero background  Of the actors  he stated that Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner were suitable for their roles  while Michael Clarke Duncan s presence alone was menacing  He finished by saying  I am getting a little worn out describing the origin stories and powers of superheroes     Some of their movies  like this one  are better than others   44 Houston Chronicle s Bruce Westbrook considered it  the best Marvel movie to date  it s as well written and character driven as some of today s Oscar contenders  and its story doesn t stall with hollow flamboyance   45 The Austin Chronicle s Kimberly Jones praised the film  the actors  and felt that though an unproven director   Johnson has just signed his meal ticket with this marriage of big brains  big brawn  and most happily big heart   46  Empire s Kim Newman gave the film 3 out of 5 stars  and felt people  will like the characters more than the film   before adding that there are enough strong moments to guarantee a good viewing  47  The Guardian s Peter Bradshaw stated that the film held  unconvincing touches  but was more enjoyable than Spider Man and as dark as Tim Burton s Batman  48 BBC film critic Nev Pierce believed the film had spectacular set pieces  but felt there was no strong narrative arc to keep the viewer interested  49 The Wall Street Journal s Joe Morgenstern considered the film to be neither original nor great but felt it maintained  many grace notes and interesting oddities   50 The Globe and Mail s Rick Groen said the film was  not woeful  not wonderful  merely watchable   42 The Philadelphia Inquirer s Steven Rea thought the film brought a variance of humour and violence  but felt it didn t work as well as it could have  42 James Berardinelli felt the film was merely a satisfactory superhero film  42 TV Guide s Frank Lovece noted that for a superhero film the characters are more grounded to reality  respectively  but also felt it was  a movie for grown ups  not kids   51  Particularly negative reviews included the one by The New York Times  Elvis Mitchell  who said the film was  second rate and ordinary   41  whilst Variety s Todd McCarthy considered it  a pretender in the realm of bona fide superheroes   52 Time Out s Trevor Johnston praised Ben Affleck  feeling he  persuades us of the pain of sightlessness and supersensitive hearing   but also felt writer director Johnson s construction fails all involved in the film  53 Slate s David Edelstein believed Johnson copied a lot of Batman  and concluded by saying  that s not so bad  The movie looks best when it looks like other  better movies   54  The Chicago Tribune s Michael Wilmington thought the film grabs the attention  but felt it does not reward it  42  The New York Post s Lou Lumenick panned the film  describing it as a  mind numbing  would be comic book franchise  which often seems as blind as its hero    not to mention deaf and dumb   42   edit  Director s cut A director s cut of the film was announced for a spring 2004 DVD release  This version contained new additions like previously unseen footage and a removed subplot  and was to be a bit darker with an R rating  The film  released in 2 35 1 widescreen format  was released with DTS and Dolby Digital sound  The new version of the film has newly recorded commentary to accompany it  featuring Mark Steven Johnson and Avi Arad  A  Making of Director s Cut  featurette also accompanied the film  The release date of the DVD was later pushed back to November 30  2004  55  56  On September 30  2008 the director s cut was released on Blu ray  57  The DVD release of the directors cut removed the wealth of bonus material included on the theatrical cut s DVD release  but it was restored for the Blu ray release  although the Blu ray release only contains the director s cut   One of the biggest changes to the film was the addition of a subplot involving a drug addict played by Coolio  While this subplot was missing from the theatrical version of the film  it is present in the novelization by Greg Cox  published in 2003  Kevin Feige commented on this version of the film  believing  the people who had other opinions  of Daredevil  will be won over by this new version   55  Reviewers like Empire s Danny Graydon seemed to reaffirm this opinion by considering this version a  considerable improvement on the original version   notably preferring the more violent undertones  a lesser focus on the romance  and the equal focus of Daredevil and his lawyer alias Matt Murdock and the subplot involving Coolio  Some gripes still remained though  as Graydon felt Affleck did not suit himself in the Daredevil outfit  and that Michael Clark Duncan as the Kingpin was done in an over the top manner  58 IGN s Jeff Otto and Andy Patrizio also deemed this version an improvement over the original  They felt this version was more loyal to the Frank Miller feel of the Daredevil world  with more focus on themes such as Murdock s struggle with his Catholic upbringing  On the whole they felt the film would be far more pleasing to the fans  and overall better than the theatrical release  59   edit  Future Kevin Feige has stated  there are many more stories to be told with old Hornhead and we d love to tell them someday   55 Avi Arad has also said that a sequel will begin development once the rights go from 20th Century Fox to Marvel Studios  60  Director Mark Steven Johnson showed interest in returning to direct with the Born Again storyline  as well as suggesting Mr  Fear as a possible villain  61  During 2004  Ben Affleck shot a cameo role for the spin off film  Elektra  at the request of Daredevil co star Jennifer Garner  62  In October 2004  Affleck stated he would only return in the lead role if Fox would renegotiate to tell the darker stories of Daredevil  and showed interest in a Kevin Smith graphic novel which included Mysterio  as well as the Born Again storyline  63  However  in November 2006 Affleck stated that he would never reprise the role  having felt  by playing a superhero in Daredevil  I have inoculated myself from ever playing another superhero    Wearing a costume was a source of humiliation for me and something I wouldn t want to do again soon   64  It is possible that Affleck made this decision because  although met with considerable praise for his performance  he received a Razzie award for his role as Daredevil  even though he was mainly chosen for his portrayals in Paycheck and Gigli  both of which were far more negatively received than Daredevil  65  In July 2006  Michael Clarke Duncan showed interest in returning for the role of the Kingpin  but stated that he would not be willing to gain weight as he felt  comfortable  being down to 270 pounds  However  he jokingly showed willingness to change his mind if he was offered  20 million  Duncan suggested that the character is portrayed to have been training a lot in jail in order to become faster in combat against Daredevil  also working as a way to fit his weight loss into the story  66  Duncan would later go on to reprise his role as the Kingpin in an episode of the animated series  Spider Man  The New Animated Series  In July 2008  Jason Statham had expressed interest in appearing as Daredevil in the future  Statham requested  just give me the chance  I would love to be Daredevil   Frank Miller commented in agreement  I think he should be Daredevil too   67  In October 2008  20th Century Fox executive Tom Rothman said that  a Daredevil reboot is something we are thinking very seriously about   Rothman added that  what it really needs is  it needs a visionary at the level that  The Dark Knight director  Chris Nolan was  It needs someone  it needs a director  honestly  who has a genuine vision   68  In February 2010  reboot news was further reported by Deadline Hollywood who announced 20th Century Fox and New Regency are looking to develop the reboot with News Corp  Vice President Peter Chernin producing and David Scarpa writing the script  Intentions are said to move forward so that the film rights to the character would not revert back to Marvel  69  On March 15  2011  it was announced that filmmaker David Slade would be directing the reboot  70 Fringe writer and producer Brad Caleb Kane has been hired to pen the film  Former wrestler King Kong Bundy has been rumoured for the role of Kingpin  71   edit  References   Tim Swanson  October 3  2001    Affleck homes in on Daredevil role   Variety  http   www
