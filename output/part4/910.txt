Eight  comic book  Related shows Angel Buffy the Vampire Slayer is an American television series that aired from March 10  1997  until May 20  2003  The series was created in 1997 by writer director Joss Whedon under his production tag  Mutant Enemy Productions with later co executive producers being Jane Espenson  David Fury  David Greenwalt  Doug Petrie  Marti Noxon  and David Solomon  The series narrative follows Buffy Summers  played by Sarah Michelle Gellar   the latest in a line of young women known as  Vampire Slayers  or simply  Slayers   In the story  Slayers are  called   chosen by fate  to battle against vampires  demons  and other forces of darkness  Like previous Slayers  Buffy is aided by a Watcher  who guides  teaches  and trains her  Unlike her predecessors  Buffy surrounds herself with a circle of loyal friends who become known as the  Scooby Gang   The series received critical and popular acclaim and usually reached between four and six million viewers on original airings  1  Although such ratings are lower than successful shows on the  big four  networks  ABC  CBS  NBC  and Fox   2  they were a success for the relatively new and smaller WB Television Network  3  Reviews for the show were positive  it has been included in many  best of  lists  including being ranked  41 on the list of TV Guide s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time   2 on Empire s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time  voted  3 in 2004 and 2007 on TV Guide s Top Cult Shows Ever 4  5  and listed in Time magazine s  100 Best TV Shows of All TIME   6  It was nominated for Emmy and Golden Globe awards  winning a total of 3 Emmys  However  snubs in lead Emmy categories resulted in outrage among TV critics and the decision by the academy to hold a tribute event in honor of the series after it had gone off the air in 2003  7  The WB network ceased operation on September 17  2006  after airing a homage to its  most memorable series   including the premiere episodes of Buffy and its spin off Angel  8 Buffy s success has led to hundreds of tie in products  including novels  comics  and video games  The series has received attention in fandom  including fan films   parody  and academia  and has influenced the direction of other television series  9  Contents 1 Production 1 1 Origins 1 2 Executive producers 1 3 Writing 1 4 Casting 1 5 Broadcast history and syndication 1 6

 edit  Origins Buffy creator Joss Whedon also served as executive producer  head writer  and director on the series  Writer Joss Whedon says that  Rhonda the Immortal Waitress  was really the first incarnation of the Buffy concept   just the idea of some woman who seems to be completely insignificant who turns out to be extraordinary   10  This early  unproduced idea evolved into Buffy  which Whedon developed to invert the Hollywood formula of  the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie   11  Whedon wanted  to subvert that idea and create someone who was a hero   11  He explained   The very first mission statement of the show was the joy of female power  having it  using it  sharing it   12  The idea was first visited through Whedon s script for the 1992 movie Buffy the Vampire Slayer  which featured Kristy Swanson in the title role  The director  Fran Rubel Kuzui  saw it as a  pop culture comedy about what people think about vampires   13  Whedon disagreed   I had written this scary film about an empowered woman  and they turned it into a broad comedy  It was crushing   14  The script was praised within the industry  15  but the movie was not  16  Several years later  Gail Berman  a Fox executive  approached Whedon to develop his Buffy concept into a television series  17  Whedon explained that  They said   Do you want to do a show   And I thought   High school as a horror movie   And so the metaphor became the central concept behind Buffy  and that s how I sold it   18  The supernatural elements in the series stood as metaphors for personal anxieties associated with adolescence and young adulthood  19  Early in its development  the series was going to be simply titled Slayer  20  Whedon went on to write and partly fund a 25 minute non broadcast pilot 21  that was shown to networks and eventually sold to the WB Network  The latter promoted the premiere with a series of History of the Slayer clips  22  and the first episode aired on March 10  1997   edit  Executive producers Joss Whedon was credited as executive producer throughout the run of the series  and for the first five seasons  1997 2001  he was also the show runner  a role that involves serving as head writer and being responsible for every aspect of production  Marti Noxon took on the role for seasons six and seven  2001 2003   but Whedon continued to be involved with writing and directing Buffy alongside projects such as Angel  Fray  and Firefly  Fran Rubel Kuzui and her husband  Kaz Kuzui  were credited as executive producers 23  but were not involved in the show  Their credit  rights  and royalties over the franchise relate to their funding  producing  and directing of the original movie version of Buffy  24   edit  Writing Script writing was done by Mutant Enemy  a production company created by Whedon in 1997  The writers with the most writing credits 25  include  Joss Whedon  Steven S  DeKnight  Jane Espenson  David Fury  Drew Goddard  Drew Greenberg  David Greenwalt  Rebecca Rand Kirshner  Marti Noxon and Doug Petrie  Other authors with writing credits include  Dean Batali  Carl Ellsworth  Tracey Forbes  Ashley Gable  Howard Gordon  Diego Gutierrez  Elin Hampton  Rob Des Hotel  Matt Kiene  Ty King  Thomas A  Swyden  Joe Reinkemeyer  Dana Reston and Dan Vebber  26  Jane Espenson has explained how scripts came together  27  First  the writers talked about the emotional issues facing Buffy Summers and how she would confront them through her battle against evil supernatural forces  Then the episode s story was  broken  into acts and scenes  Act breaks were designed as key moments to intrigue viewers so that they would stay with the episode following the commercial break  The writers collectively filled in scenes surrounding these act breaks for a more fleshed out story  A whiteboard marked their progress by mapping brief descriptions of each scene  Once  breaking  was done  the credited author wrote an outline for the episode  which was checked by Whedon or Noxon  The writer then wrote a full script  which went through a series of drafts  and finally a quick rewrite from the show runner  The final article was used as the shooting script   edit  Casting Actresses who auditioned for Buffy Summers and got other roles include Julie Benz  Darla   Elizabeth Anne Allen  Amy Madison   Julia Lee  Chanterelle Lily Houston Anne Steele   Charisma Carpenter  Cordelia Chase   and Mercedes McNab  Harmony Kendall   Bianca Lawson  who played vampire slayer Kendra Young in season 2 of the show  originally auditioned for the role of Cordelia Chase before Charisma Carpenter was cast in the role  The title role went to Sarah Michelle Gellar  who had appeared as Sydney Rutledge on Swans Crossing and Kendall Hart on All My Children  At age 18 in 1995  Gellar had already won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Leading Actress in a Drama Series  28  In 1996  she was initially cast as Cordelia Chase during a week of auditioning  She decided to keep trying for the role of Buffy  and after several more auditions  she landed the lead  29  Nathan Fillion auditioned for the role of Angel back in early 1996  David Boreanaz had already been cast at the time of the unaired Buffy pilot  but did not appear  Anthony Stewart Head had already led a prolific acting and singing career  30  but remained best known in the United States for a series of twelve coffee commercials with Sharon Maughan for Nescaf   31  He accepted the role of Rupert Giles  Unlike other Buffy regulars  Nicholas Brendon had little acting experience  instead working various jobs   including production assistant  plumber s assistant  veterinary janitor  food delivery  script delivery  day care counselor  and waiter   before breaking into acting and overcoming his stutter  32  33  He landed his Xander Harris role following only four days of auditioning  34 Ryan Reynolds and Danny Strong  Jonathan Levinson  also auditioned for the part  Alyson Hannigan was the last of the original six to be cast  Following her role in My Stepmother Is an Alien  35  she appeared in commercials and supporting roles on television shows throughout the early 1990s  35  In 1996  the role of Willow Rosenberg was initially played by Riff Regan for the unaired Buffy pilot  but Hannigan auditioned when the role was being recast for the series proper  Hannigan described her approach to the character through Willow s reaction to a particular moment  Willow sadly tells Buffy that her Barbie doll was taken from her as a child  Buffy asks her if she ever got it back  Willow s line was to reply  most of it   Hannigan decided on an upbeat and happy delivery of the line  most of it   as opposed to a sad  depressed delivery  Hannigan figured Willow would be happy and proud that she got  most of it  back  That indicated how she was going to play the rest of the scene  and the role  for that matter  and defined the character  36  Her approach subsequently got her the role   edit  Broadcast history and syndication UPN took great advantage promoting the network switch by teasing fans of Buffy s resurrection from The WB s series finale  Buffy the Vampire Slayer first aired on March 10  1997   as a mid season replacement for the show Savannah  on the WB network  and played a key role in the growth of the Warner Bros  television network in its early years  37  After five seasons  it transferred to the United Paramount Network  UPN  for its final two seasons  In 2001  the show went into syndication in the United States on local stations and on cable channel FX  the local airings ended in 2005  and the FX airings lasted until 2008  Beginning in January 2010  it began to air in syndication in the United States on Logo  38  Reruns also briefly aired on MTV  In March 2010  it began to air in Canada on MuchMusic and MuchMore  39  On November 7  2010  it began airing on Chiller with a 24 hour marathon  the series airs weekdays  Chiller has also aired a 14 hour Thanksgiving Day marathon on November 25  2010  40  In 2011  it began airing on Oxygen and TeenNick  While the seventh season was still being broadcast  Sarah Michelle Gellar told Entertainment Weekly she was not going to sign on for an eighth year   When we started to have such a strong year this year  I thought   This is how I want to go out  on top  at our best   41  Whedon and UPN gave some considerations to production of a spin off series that would not require Gellar  including a rumored Faith series  but nothing came of those plans  42  The Buffy canon is continuing outside the television medium in the Dark Horse Comics series  Buffy Season Eight  This has been produced since March 2007 by Whedon  who also wrote the first story arc   The Long Way Home   43  As of July 15  2008  Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes are available to download for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable video game consoles via the PlayStation Network  44  In the United Kingdom  the entire series aired on Sky1 and BBC2  After protests from fans about early episodes being edited for their pre watershed time slot  from the second run  mid second season onwards   the BBC gave the show two time slots  the early evening slot  typically Thursday at 6 45 pm  for a family friendly version with violence  objectionable language and other stronger material cut out  and a late night uncut version  initially late night Sundays  but for most of the run  late night Fridays  exact times varied   45  Sky1 aired the show typically at 8 00 pm on Thursdays  From the fourth season onwards  the BBC aired the show in anamorphic 16 9 widescreen format  Whedon later said that Buffy was never intended to be viewed this way  46  Despite his claims  Sky1 and FX UK now air repeat showings in the widescreen format   edit  Opening sequence The Buffy opening sequence provides credits early in each show  The music was performed by the rock band Nerf Herder  The melody is similar to that of an Austrian pop song from the 1980s called  Codo  by D F  but Nerf Herder have said that they had  never heard of D F  and the similarity was coincidental  47  In the DVD commentary for the first Buffy episode  Whedon said his decision to go with Nerf Herder s theme was influenced by cast member Alyson Hannigan  who had made him listen to the band s music  48  Janet Halfyard  in her essay  Music  Gender  and Identity in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel   describes the opening  It begins with the sound of an organ  accompanied by a wolf s howl  with a visual image of a flickering night sky overlaid with unintelligible archaic script  the associations with both the silent era and films such as Nosferatu and with the conventions of the Hammer House of Horror and horror in general are unmistakable  49  But the theme changes   The opening sequence removes itself from the sphere of 1960s and 70s horror by replaying the same motif  the organ now supplanted by an aggressively strummed electric guitar  relocating itself in modern youth culture   49  This music is heard over images of a young cast involved in the action and turbulence of adolescence  The sequence provides a post modern twist on the horror genre  49  The brief clips of characters and events which compose the opening sequence are updated from season to season  The only shots that persist across all seven seasons are those of a book titled Vampyr and of the cross given to Buffy by Angel in the first episode  Each sequence ends with a lingering shot of Buffy  which changes between seasons  In seasons six and seven  the final shots of Gellar are respectively as Buffybot in  The Gift   season five finale  and the First Evil posing as Buffy in  Lessons   season seven premiere   The only exception was in the season four episode  Superstar   which featured a long shot of Jonathan Levinson  Four episodes feature an opening sequence that is unique to that specific episode  The fourth season episode  Superstar  is the same as the season four credits except numerous clips of Jonathan are added in  replacing some heroic action clips of Buffy  This is a humorous reference to the fact that  in the episode  Jonathan has bewitched the people of Sunnydale into perceiving him as a heroic worldwide idol for them all  which they forget about after the spell is broken at the end of the episode  causing the opening credits to revert back to normal in the following episodes  The fifth season premiere  Buffy vs  Dracula  has the regular season five credits with the omission of the Michelle Trachtenberg  Dawn  scenes from the title sequence  She is instead credited as a guest star  The season six episode  Once More  with Feeling  has a different opening theme song and credits  The season six episode  Seeing Red  added Amber Benson  Tara  into the regular season six opening credits for her final episode   edit  Music Main article  Music in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel Buffy features a mix of original  indie  rock and pop music  The composers spent around seven days scoring between fourteen to thirty minutes of music for each episode  50 Christophe Beck revealed that the Buffy composers used computers and synthesizers and were limited to recording one or two  real  samples  Despite this  their goal was to produce  dramatic  orchestration that would stand up to film scores  50  Alongside the score  most episodes featured indie rock music  usually at the characters  venue of choice  The Bronze  Buffy music supervisor John King explained that  we like to use unsigned bands  that  you would believe would play in this place   50  For example  the fictional group Dingoes Ate My Baby were portrayed on screen by front group Four Star Mary  51  Pop songs by famous artists were rarely featured prominently  but several episodes spotlighted the sounds of more famous artists such as Sarah McLachlan  52  53 The Brian Jonestown Massacre  Blink 182  54 Third Eye Blind  55 Aimee Mann 56   who also had a line of dialogue   The Dandy Warhols  57 Cibo Matto  58 Coldplay  Lisa Loeb  and Michelle Branch  59  The popularity of music used in Buffy has led to the release of four soundtrack albums  Buffy the Vampire Slayer  The Album  60 Radio Sunnydale  61  the  Once More  with Feeling  Soundtrack  62  63  64  and Buffy the Vampire Slayer  The Score   edit  Setting and storylines  edit  Setting and filming locations Main articles  Sunnydale  Hellmouth and Filming locations Most of Buffy was shot on location in Los Angeles  California  The main exterior set of the town of Sunnydale  including the infamous  sun sign   was located in Santa Monica  California in a lot on Olympic Boulevard  65  The show is set in the fictional California town of Sunnydale  whose suburban Sunnydale High School sits on top of a  Hellmouth   a gateway to demon realms  The Hellmouth  located beneath the school library  is a source of mystical energies as well as a nexus for a wide variety of evil creatures and supernatural phenomena  In addition to being an open ended plot device  Joss Whedon has cited the Hellmouth and  High school as Hell  as one of the primary metaphors in creating the series  66  The high school used in the first three seasons is actually Torrance High School  in Torrance  California  This school was used until the residents of Torrance complained about loud sounds at night  67  The school exterior has been used in other television shows and movies  most notably Beverly Hills  90210  Bring It On  She s All That and the spoof Not Another Teen Movie  67  In addition to the high school and its library  scenes take place in the town s cemeteries  a local nightclub  The Bronze   and Buffy s home  located in Torrance   where many of the characters live at various points in the series  Some of the exterior shots of the college Buffy attends  UC Sunnydale  were filmed at UCLA  Several episodes include shots from the Oviatt Library at CSUN  68  69   edit  Format Buffy is told in a serialized format  with each episode involving a self contained story while contributing to a larger storyline  19  which is broken down into season long narratives marked by the rise and defeat of a powerful antagonist  commonly referred to as the  Big Bad   While the show is mainly a drama with frequent comic relief  most episodes blend different genres  including horror  martial arts  romance  melodrama  farce  science fiction  comedy  and even  in one episode  musical comedy  The series  narrative revolves around Buffy and her friends  collectively dubbed the  Scooby Gang   who struggle to balance the fight against supernatural evils with their complex social lives  19  The show mixes complex  season long storylines with a villain of the week format  a typical episode contains one or more villains  or supernatural phenomena  that are thwarted or defeated by the end of the episode  Though elements and relationships are explored and ongoing subplots are included  the show focuses primarily on Buffy and her role as an archetypal heroine  In the first few seasons  the most prominent monsters in the Buffy bestiary are vampires  which are based on traditional myths  lore  and literary conventions  As the series continues  Buffy and her companions fight an increasing variety of demons  as well as ghosts  werewolves  zombies  and unscrupulous humans  They frequently save the world from annihilation by a combination of physical combat  magic  and detective style investigation  and are guided by an extensive collection of ancient and mystical reference books  Hand to hand combat is chiefly undertaken by Buffy and Angel  later by Spike  and to a far lesser degree by Giles and Xander  Willow eventually becomes an adept witch  while Giles contributes his extensive knowledge of demonology and supernatural lore   edit  Inspirations and metaphors During the first year of the series  Whedon described the show as  My So Called Life meets The X Files   70 My So Called Life gave a sympathetic portrayal of teen anxieties  in contrast  The X Files delivered a supernatural  monster of the week  storyline  Alongside these series  Whedon has cited cult film Night of the Comet as a  big influence   71  and credited the X Men character Kitty Pryde as a significant influence on the character of Buffy  72  The authors of the unofficial guidebook Dusted point out that the series was often a pastiche  borrowing elements from previous horror novels  movies  and short stories and from such common literary stock as folklore and mythology  73  Nevitt and Smith describe Buffy s use of pastiche as  post modern Gothic   74  For example  the Adam character parallels the Frankenstein monster  the episode  Bad Eggs  parallels Invasion of the Body Snatchers  and so on  Buffy episodes often include a deeper meaning or metaphor as well  Whedon explained   We think very carefully about what we re trying to say emotionally  politically  and even philosophically while we re writing it    it really is  apart from being a pop culture phenomenon  something that is deeply layered textually episode by episode   75  Academics Wilcox and Lavery provide examples of how a few episodes deal with real life issues turned into supernatural metaphors  In the world of Buffy the problems that teenagers face become literal monsters  A mother can take over her daughter s life   Witch    a strict stepfather to be really is a heartless machine   Ted    a young lesbian fears that her nature is demonic   Goodbye Iowa  and  Family    a girl who has sex with even the nicest seeming guy may discover that he afterwards becomes a monster   Innocence    19  The love affair between the vampire Angel and Buffy was fraught with metaphors  For example  their night of passion cost the vampire his soul  Sarah Michelle Gellar said   That s the ultimate metaphor  You sleep with a guy and he turns bad on you   76  Buffy struggles throughout the series with her calling as Slayer and the loss of freedom this entails  frequently sacrificing teenage experiences for her Slayer duties  Her difficulties and eventual empowering realizations are reflections of several dichotomies faced by modern women and echo feminist issues within society  77  In the episode  Becoming  Part 2    when Joyce learns that Buffy is the Slayer  her reaction has strong echoes of a parent discovering their child is gay  including denial  suggesting that she try  not being a Slayer   and ultimately kicking Buffy out of the house  78   edit  Episode lists Main article  List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes  edit  Plot summary Season

appeared in 13 episodes  spanning much of season five   Similarly  characters who allied themselves to the group and characters which attended the same institutions were sometimes featured in multiple episodes   edit  Spin offs Buffy has inspired a range of official and unofficial works  including television shows  books  comics and games  This expansion of the series encouraged use of the term  Buffyverse  to describe the fictional universe in which Buffy and related stories take place  79  The franchise has inspired Buffy action figures and merchandise such as official Buffy Angel magazines and Buffy companion books  Eden Studios has published a Buffy role playing game  while Score Entertainment has released a Buffy Collectible Card Game   edit  Possible film or series continuation Joss Whedon was interested in a film continuation in 1998  80  but such a film has yet to materialize   edit  Angel Main article  Angel  TV series  The spin off Angel was introduced in October 1999  at the start of Buffy season four  The series was created by Buffy s creator Joss Whedon in collaboration with David Greenwalt  Like Buffy  it was produced by the production company Mutant Enemy  At times  it performed better in the Nielsen ratings than its parent series did  1  The series was given a darker tone focusing on the ongoing trials of Angel in Los Angeles  His character is tormented by guilt following the return of his soul  punishment for more than a century of murder and torture  During the first four seasons of the show  he works as a private detective in a fictionalized version of Los Angeles  California  where he and his associates work to  help the helpless  and to restore the faith and  save the souls  of those who have lost their way  Typically  this mission involves doing battle with evil demons or demonically allied humans  primarily the law firm Wolfram  amp  Hart   while Angel must also contend with his own violent nature  In season five  the Senior Partners of Wolfram and Hart take a bold gamble in their campaign to corrupt Angel  giving him control of their Los Angeles office  Angel accepts the deal as an opportunity to fight evil from the inside  In addition to Boreanaz  Angel inherited Buffy regular Charisma Carpenter  Cordelia Chase   When Glenn Quinn  Doyle  left the series during its first season  Alexis Denisof  Wesley Wyndam Pryce   who had been a recurring character in the last nine episodes of season three of Buffy  took his place  Carpenter and Denisof were followed later by Mercedes McNab  Harmony Kendall  and James Marsters  Spike

Lenk  Andrew Wells   Alyson Hannigan  Willow Rosenberg   Julie Benz  Darla   and Juliet Landau  Drusilla   Angel also continued to appear occasionally on Buffy   edit  Expanded universe Main articles  Buffyverse canon  List of Buffy novels  and List of Buffyverse comics Trade paperback cover of Buffy  Season Eight Volume One  written by Joss Whedon  Outside of the TV series  the Buffyverse has been officially expanded and elaborated on by authors and artists in the so called  Buffyverse Expanded Universe   The creators of these works may or may not keep to established continuity  Similarly  writers for the TV series were under no obligation to use information which had been established by the Expanded Universe  and sometimes contradicted such continuity  Dark Horse has published the Buffy comics since 1998  81  In 2003  Whedon wrote an eight issue miniseries for Dark Horse Comics titled Fray  about a Slayer in the future  Following the publication of Tales of the Vampires in 2004  Dark Horse Comics halted publication on Buffyverse related comics and graphic novels  The company produced Whedon s Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight with forty issues from March 2007 to January 2011  picking up where the television show left off   taking the place of an eighth canonical season  43  The first story arc is also written by Whedon  and is called  The Long Way Home  which has been widely well received  with circulation rivalling industry leaders DC and Marvel s top selling titles  82  Also after  The Long Way Home  came other story arcs like Faith s return in  No Future for You  and a Fray cross over in  Time of Your Life   Dark Horse began producing Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine in August 2011 and is planned to run for 25 issues  Pocket Books hold the license to produce Buffy novels  of which they have published more than sixty since 1998  These sometimes flesh out background information on characters  for example  Go Ask Malice details the events that lead up to Faith arriving in Sunnydale  The most recent novels include Carnival of Souls  Blackout  Portal Through Time  Bad Bargain  and The Deathless  Five official Buffy video games have been released on portable and home consoles  83  Most notably  Buffy the Vampire Slayer for Xbox in 2002 and Chaos Bleeds for GameCube  Xbox and PlayStation 2 in 2003  84   edit  Undeveloped spinoffs Main article  Undeveloped Buffy the Vampire Slayer spinoffs The popularity of Buffy and Angel has led to attempts to develop more on screen ventures in the fictional  Buffyverse   These projects remain undeveloped and may never be greenlit  In 2002  two potential spinoffs were in discussion  Buffy the Animated Series and Ripper  Buffy the Animated Series was a proposed animated TV show based on Buffy  Whedon and Jeph Loeb were to be executive producers for the show  and most of the cast from Buffy were to return to voice their characters  20th Century Fox showed an interest in developing and selling the show to another network  A three minute pilot was completed in 2004  but was never picked up  Whedon revealed to The Hollywood Reporter   We just could not find a home for it  We had six or seven hilarious scripts from our own staff   and nobody wanted it   85  Neither the pilot nor the scripts have been seen outside of the entertainment industry  though writer Jane Espenson has teasingly revealed small extracts from some of her scripts for the show  86  Ripper was originally a proposed television show based upon the character of Rupert Giles portrayed by Anthony Stewart Head  More recent information has suggested that if Ripper were ever made  it would be a TV movie or a DVD movie  87  There was little heard about the series until 2007 when Joss Whedon confirmed that talks were almost completed for a 90 minute Ripper special on the BBC 88  with both Head and the BBC completely on board  In 2003  a year after the first public discussions on Buffy the Animated Series and Ripper  Buffy was nearing its end  Espenson has said that during this time spinoffs were discussed   I think Marti talked with Joss about Slayer School and Tim Minear talked with him about Faith on a motorcycle  I assume there was some back and forth pitching   89  Espenson has revealed that Slayer School might have used new slayers and potentially included Willow Rosenberg  but Whedon did not think that such a spinoff felt right  90  Dushku declined the pitch for a Buffyverse TV series based on Faith and instead agreed to a deal to produce Tru Calling  Dushku explained to IGN   It would have been a really hard thing to do  and not that I would not have been up for a challenge  but with it coming on immediately following Buffy  I think that those would have been really big boots to fill   91  Tim Minear explained some of the ideas behind the aborted series   The show was basically going to be Faith meets Kung Fu  It would have been Faith  probably on a motorcycle  crossing the earth  trying to find her place in the world   92  Finally  during the summer of 2004 after the end of Angel  a movie about Spike was proposed  93  The movie would have been directed by Tim Minear and starred Marsters and Amy Acker and featured Alyson Hannigan  94  Outside the 2006 Saturn Awards  Whedon announced that he had pitched the concept to various bodies but had yet to receive any feedback  95  In September 2008  Sci Fi Wire ran an interview with Sarah Michelle Gellar in which she said she would not rule out returning to her most iconic role   Never say never   she said   One of the reasons the original Buffy movie did not really work on the big screen and people blamed Kristy  but that s not what it was the story was better told over a long arc   Gellar said   And I worry about Buffy as a  beginning  middle and end  so quickly      You show me a script  you show me that it works  and you show me that  the  audience can accept that   and  I d probably be there  Those are what my hesitations are   96   edit  Cultural impact Anthony Stewart Head and Nicholas Brendon at the Oakland Super SlayerCon fan convention Buffy has had a cultural impact on a number of media  It has impacted television studies and inspired fan made films  it has been parodied and referenced  and has influenced other television series   edit  Academia Main article  Buffy studies Buffy is notable for attracting the interest of scholars of popular culture as a subset of popular culture studies  Some academic settings include the show as a topic of literary study and analysis  97  98 National Public Radio describes Buffy as having a  special following among academics  some of whom have staked a claim in what they call  Buffy Studies    99  Though not widely recognized as a distinct discipline  the term  Buffy studies  is commonly used amongst the peer reviewed academic Buffy related writings  100  The response to this attention has had its critics  For example  Jes Battis  who authored Blood Relations in Buffy and Angel  admits that study of the Buffyverse  invokes an uneasy combination of enthusiasm and ire   and meets  a certain amount of disdain from within the halls of the academy   101  Nonetheless Buffy eventually led to the publication of around twenty books and hundreds of articles examining the themes of the show from a wide range of disciplinary perspectives including sociology  Speech Communication  psychology  philosophy  and women s studies  102  The Whedon Studies Association produces the online academic journal Slayage and sponsors a biennial academic conference on the works of Joss Whedon   edit  Fandom and fan films See also  Unofficial Buffy the Vampire Slayer productions The popularity of Buffy has led to websites  online

employed pop culture references as a frequent humorous device  has itself become a frequent pop culture reference in video games  comics and television shows  and has been frequently parodied and spoofed  Sarah Michelle Gellar has participated in several parody sketches  including a Saturday Night Live sketch in which the Slayer is relocated to the Seinfeld universe  103  and adding her voice to an episode of Robot Chicken that parodied a would be eighth season of Buffy  104   Buffy  is the code name used for the mobile phone created by the social networking website Facebook  105   edit  U

the Vampire Slayer had a series high during the third season with 5 3 million viewers  this probably due to the fact that both Gellar and Hannigan had hit movies out during the season  Cruel Intentions and American Pie respectively   and a series low with 3 6 million during the seventh season  The show s series finale  Chosen  pulled in a season high of 4 9 million viewers on the UPN network  Buffy did not compete with shows on the big four networks  CBS  ABC  NBC  and Fox   but The WB was impressed with the young audience that the show was bringing in  Because of this  The WB ordered a full season of 22 episodes for the series  second season  After the episode  Surprise   which was watched by 8 2 million people  Buffy was moved from Monday at 9 pm to launch The WB s new night of programming on Tuesday  Due to its large success in that time slot  it remained on Tuesdays at 8 pm for the remainder of its original run  With its new timeslot on The WB  the show quickly climbed to the top of The WB ratings and became one of their highest rated shows for the remainder of its time on the network  The show always placed in the top 3  usually only coming in behind 7th Heaven  Between seasons three and five  Buffy flip flopped with Dawson s Creek and Charmed as the network s second highest rated show  In the 2001 2002 season  the show had moved to UPN after a negotiation dispute with The WB  While it was still one of their highest rated shows on their network  The WB felt that the show had already peaked and was not worth giving a salary increase to the cast and crew  UPN on the other hand  had strong faith in the series and quickly grabbed it along with Roswell  UPN dedicated a two hour premiere to the series to help re launch it   edit  Impact on television Commentators of the entertainment industry including Allmovie  The Hollywood Reporter and The Washington Post have cited Buffy as  influential   111  Autumn 2003 saw several new shows going into production in the U S  that featured strong females who are forced to come to terms with supernatural power or destiny while trying to maintain a normal life  112  These post Buffy shows include Dead Like Me  Joan of Arcadia and Teen Wolf   Bryan Fuller  the creator of Dead Like Me  said that  Buffy showed that young women could be in situations that were both fantastic and relatable  and instead of shunting women off to the side  it puts them at the center   112  In the United Kingdom  the lessons learned from the impact of Buffy influenced the revived Doctor Who series  2005 present   113  and executive producer Russell T Davies has said  Buffy the Vampire Slayer showed the whole world  and an entire sprawling industry  that writing monsters and demons and end of the world is not hack work  it can challenge the best  Joss Whedon raised the bar for every writer not just genre niche writers  but every single one of us  114  As well as influencing Doctor Who  Buffy influenced its spinoff series Torchwood  115  Several Buffy alumni have gone on to write for or create other shows  Such endeavors include Tru Calling  Douglas Petrie  Jane Espenson and lead actress Eliza Dushku   Wonderfalls  Tim Minear   Point Pleasant  Marti Noxon   Jake 2 0  David Greenwalt   The Inside  Tim Minear   Smallville  Steven S  DeKnight   Once Upon a Time  Jane Espenson   and Lost  Drew Goddard and David Fury   Meanwhile  the Parents Television Council complained of efforts to  deluge their young viewing audiences with adult themes   116  The U S  Federal Communications Commission  FCC   however  rejected the Council s indecency complaint concerning the violent sex scene between Buffy and Spike in  Smashed  117  The BBC  however  chose to censor some of the more controversial sexual content when it was shown on the pre watershed 6 45 pm slot  118   edit  Series information The first season was introduced as a mid season replacement for the short lived night time soap opera Savannah  and therefore was made up of only 12 episodes  Each subsequent season was built up of 22 episodes  Discounting the unaired Buffy pilot  the seven seasons make up a total of 144 Buffy episodes aired between 1997 and 2003   edit  Awards and nominations Main article  Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel awards and nominations Buffy has gathered a number of awards and nominations which include an Emmy Award nomination for the 1999 episode  Hush   which featured an extended sequence with no character dialogue  119  The 2001 episode  The Body  revolved around the death of Buffy s
