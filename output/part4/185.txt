North American continent  with Canada to the east  the Arctic Ocean to the north  and the Pacific Ocean to the west and south  with Russia further west across the Bering Strait  Alaska is the 4th least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 United States  Approximately half of Alaska s 722 718 3  residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area  Alaska was purchased from Russia on March 30  1867  for  7 2 million   120 million in today s dollars  at approximately two cents per acre   4 74 km    The land went through several administrative changes before becoming an organized  or incorporated  territory on May 11  1912  and the 49th state of the U S  on January 3  1959  5  The name  Alaska           was already introduced in the Russian colonial period  when it was used only for the peninsula and is derived from the Aleut alaxsxaq  meaning  the mainland  or  more literally   the object towards which the action of the sea is directed   6  It is also known as Alyeska  the  great land   an Aleut word derived from the same root  Contents 1 Geography 1 1 Regions 1 1 1 South Central 1 1 2 Southeast 1 1 3 Interior 1 1 4 Southwest 1 1 5 North Slope 1 1 6

non contiguous U S  state on continental North America  about 500 miles  800 km  of British Columbia  Canada  separate Alaska from Washington state  Alaska is thus an exclave of the United States  It is technically part of the continental U S   but is often not included in colloquial use  Alaska is not part of the contiguous U S   often called  the Lower 48   8  The capital city  Juneau  is situated on the mainland of the North American continent  but is not connected by road to the rest of the North American highway system  The state is bordered by the Yukon Territory and British Columbia in Canada  to the east  the Gulf of Alaska and the Pacific Ocean to the south  the Bering Sea  Bering Strait  and Chukchi Sea to the west and the Arctic Ocean to the north  Alaska s territorial waters touch Russia s territorial waters in the Bering Strait  as the Russian Big Diomede Island and Alaskan Little Diomede Island are only 3 miles  4 8 km  apart  With the extension of the Aleutian Islands into the eastern hemisphere  it is technically both the westernmost and easternmost state in the United States  as well as also being the northernmost  Alaska s size compared with the 48 contiguous states  Alaska is the largest state in the United States in land area at 586 412 square miles  1 518 800 km2   over twice the size of Texas  the next largest state  Alaska is larger than all but 18 sovereign countries  Counting territorial waters  Alaska is larger than the combined area of the next three largest states  Texas  California  and Montana  It is also larger than the combined area of the 22 smallest U S  states  Regions There are no officially defined borders demarcating the various regions of Alaska  but there are six widely accepted regions  South Central Main article  South Central Alaska The most populous region of Alaska  containing Anchorage  the Matanuska Susitna Valley and the Kenai Peninsula  Rural  mostly unpopulated areas south of the Alaska Range and west of the Wrangell Mountains also fall within the definition of Southcentral  as well as the Prince William Sound area and the communities of Cordova and Valdez  Southeast Main article  Southeast Alaska Also known as the Panhandle  this is the region of Alaska closest to the rest of the United States  and hence was where most initial non Native settlement occurred following the Alaska Purchase  It contains the state capital  Juneau  the former capital  Sitka  and the large town of Ketchikan  The road systems leading from these cities are strictly local  no roads connect these communities to each other or any other communities apart from their own suburbs  The region is dominated by the Alexander Archipelago as well as the Tongass National Forest  the largest national forest in the United States  Interior Main article  Alaska Interior Mount McKinley is both the highest peak in Alaska and in all of North America  The largest region of Alaska  much of it uninhabited wilderness  Fairbanks is the only community of any significant size  Small towns and Native villages are scattered throughout  mostly along the highway and river systems  Denali National Park and Preserve is located here  home to Mount McKinley  also widely known by its local name of Denali   the highest point in North America  Southwest Main article  Southwest Alaska Grizzly bear fishing for salmon at Brooks Falls  A sparsely inhabited region stretching some 500 miles  800 km  inland from the Bering Sea  Most of the population lives along the coast  Kodiak Island is also located in Southwest  The massive Yukon Kuskokwim Delta  one of the largest river deltas in the world  is here  Portions of the Alaska Peninsula are considered part of Southwest  with the remaining portions included with the Aleutian Islands  see below   North Slope Main article  Alaska North Slope The North Slope is mostly tundra peppered with small villages  The area is known for its massive reserves of crude oil  and contains both the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska and the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field  9 Barrow  the northernmost city in the United States  is located here  The Northwest Arctic area  anchored by Kotzebue and also containing the Kobuk River valley  is often regarded as being part of this region  However  the respective Inupiat of the North Slope and of the Northwest Arctic seldom think of themselves as one  Aleutian Islands Main article  Aleutian Islands More than 300 small  volcanic islands make up this chain  which stretches over 1 200 miles  1 900 km  into the Pacific Ocean  The International Date Line was drawn west of 180  to keep the whole state  and thus the entire North American continent  within the same legal day  However  because some of these islands fall in the Eastern Hemisphere  this makes Alaska the northernmost  easternmost and westernmost state in the union  with the southernmost state being Hawaii  Two of the islands  Attu and Kiska  were occupied by Japanese forces during World War II  Natural features Augustine Volcano erupting on January 12  2006  With its myriad islands  Alaska has nearly 34 000 miles  54 720 km  of tidal shoreline  The Aleutian Islands chain extends west from the southern tip of the Alaska Peninsula  Many active volcanoes are found in the Aleutians and in coastal regions  Unimak Island  for example  is home to Mount Shishaldin  which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to 10 000 feet  3 048 m  above the North Pacific  It is the most perfect volcanic cone on Earth  even more symmetrical than Japan s Mount Fuji  The chain of volcanoes extends to Mount Spurr  west of Anchorage on the mainland  Geologists have identified Alaska as part of Wrangellia  a large region consisting of multiple states and Canadian provinces in the Pacific Northwest which is actively undergoing continent building  One of the world s largest tides occurs in Turnagain Arm  just south of Anchorage   tidal differences can be more than 35 feet  10 7 m    Many sources say Turnagain has the second greatest tides in North America  but several areas in Canada have larger tides   10  Main article  List of lakes in Alaska Alaska has more than three million lakes  11  12 Marshlands and wetland permafrost cover 188 320 square miles  487 747 km2   mostly in northern  western and southwest flatlands   Glacier ice covers some 16 000 square miles  41 440 km2  of land and 1 200 square miles  3 110 km2  of tidal zone  The Bering Glacier complex near the southeastern border with Yukon covers 2 250 square miles  5 827 km2  alone  With over 100 000  Alaska has half of the world s glaciers  Land ownership Alaska has more public land owned by the federal government than any other state  13  According to an October 1998 report by the United States Bureau of Land Management  approximately 65  of Alaska is owned and managed by the U S  federal government as public lands  including a multitude of national forests  national parks  and national wildlife refuges  Of these  the Bureau of Land Management manages 87 million acres  35 million hectares   or 23 8  of the state  The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service  It is the world s largest wildlife refuge  comprising 16 million acres  6 5 million hectares   Of the remaining land area  the state of Alaska owns 101 million acres  41 million hectares   its entitlement under the Alaska Statehood Act  A portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to organized boroughs  under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs  Smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading related opportunities  though these are infrequently popular due to the often remote and roadless locations  The University of Alaska  as a land grant university  also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently  Another 44 million acres  18 million hectares  are owned by 12 regional  and scores of local  Native corporations created under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act  Regional Native corporation Doyon  Limited often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in Alaska in advertisements and other communications  Provisions of ANCSA allowing the corporations  land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in 1991 were repealed before they could take effect  Effectively  the corporations hold title  including subsurface title in many cases  a privilege denied to individual Alaskans  but cannot sell the land  Individual Native allotments can be and are sold on the open market  however  Various private interests own the remaining land  totaling about one percent of the state  Alaska is  by a large margin  the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when Native corporation holdings are excluded  Climate Main article  Climate of Alaska The climate in Juneau and the southeast panhandle is a mid latitude oceanic climate  K ppen climate classification Cfb  in the southern sections and a subarctic oceanic climate  K ppen Cfc  in the northern parts  On an annual basis  the panhandle is both the wettest and warmest part of Alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year  Juneau averages over 50 inches  1 270 mm  of precipitation a year  while other areas receive over 275 inches  6 990 mm   14  This is also the only region in Alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months  The climate of Anchorage and south central Alaska is mild by Alaskan standards due to the region s proximity to the seacoast  While the area gets less rain than southeast Alaska  it gets more snow  and days tend to be clearer  On average  Anchorage receives 16 inches  406 mm  of precipitation a year  with around 75 inches  191 cm  of snow  although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow  It is a subarctic climate  K ppen Dfc  due to its brief  cool summers  Barrow  known colloquially for many years by the nickname  Top of the World   is the northernmost city in the United States  The climate of Western Alaska is determined in large part by the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska  It is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north  The temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is  This region has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation  An area stretching from the northern side of the Seward Peninsula to the Kobuk River valley is technically a desert  with portions receiving less than 10 inches  254 mm  of precipitation annually  On the other extreme  some locations between Dillingham and Bethel average around 100 inches  2 540 mm  of precipitation  14  The climate of the interior of Alaska is subarctic  Some of the highest and lowest temperatures in Alaska occur around the area near Fairbanks  The summers may have temperatures reaching into the 90s  F  the low to mid 30s  C   while in the winter  the temperature can fall below  60  F   51 1  C   Precipitation is sparse in the Interior  often less than 10 inches  254 mm  a year  but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire winter  The highest and lowest recorded temperatures in Alaska are both in the Interior  The highest is 100  F  37 8  C  in Fort Yukon  which is just 8 miles or 13 kilometers inside the arctic circle  on June 27  1915  15  16  making Alaska tied with Hawaii as the state with the lowest high temperature in the United States  17  18  The lowest official Alaska temperature is  80  F   62 2  C  in Prospect Creek on January 23  1971  15  16  one degree above the lowest temperature recorded in continental North America  in Snag  Yukon  Canada   19  The climate in the extreme north of Alaska is Arctic  K ppen ET  with long  very cold winters and short  cool summers  Even in July  the average low temperature in Barrow is 34  F  1 1  C   20  Precipitation is light in this part of Alaska  with many places averaging less than 10 inches  254 mm  per year  mostly as snow which stays on the ground almost the entire year  History Main article  History of Alaska Alaska natives See also  Prehistory of Alaska A modern Alutiiq dancer in traditional festival garb Numerous indigenous peoples occupied Alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of European peoples to the area  The Tlingit people developed a matriarchal society in what is today Southeast Alaska  along with parts of British Columbia and the Yukon  Also in Southeast were the Haida  now well known for their unique arts  and the Tsimshian people  whose population were decimated by a smallpox epidemic in the 1860s  The Aleutian Islands are still home to the Aleut people s seafaring society  although they were among the first native Alaskans to be exploited by Russians  Western and Southwestern Alaska are home to the Yup ik  while their cousins the Alutiiq lived in what is now Southcentral Alaska  The Gwich in people of the northern Interior region are primarily known today for their dependence on the caribou within the much contested Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  The North Slope and Little Diomede Island are occupied by the widespread Inuit people  Colonization Some researchers believe that the first Russian settlement in Alaska was established in 17th century  21  According to this hypothesis  in 1648 several koches of Semyon Dezhnyov s expedition were thrown to Alaska by storm and founded this settlement  This hypothesis is based on the message of Chukchi geographer Nikolai Daurkin who had visited Alaska in 1764 1765 and reported about village on the Kheuveren river  populated by  bearded men  who  pray to the icons   Some modern researchers associate Kheuveren with Koyuk River  22  The Russian settlement of St  Paul s Harbor  Kodiak Island  1814  It is usually assumed that the first European boat to reach Alaska was the St  Gabriel under the authority of the surveyor M  S  Gvozdev and assistant navigator I  Fyodorov on August 21  1732 during expedition of Siberian cossak A  F  Shestakov adb Belorussian explorer D  I  Pavlutsky  1729 1735  23  Another European contact with Alaska occurred in 1741  when Vitus Bering led an expedition for the Russian Navy aboard the St  Peter  After his crew returned to Russia with sea otter pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world  small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of Siberia towards the Aleutian islands  The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1784  Between 1774 and 1800 Spain sent several expeditions to Alaska in order to assert its claim over the Pacific Northwest  In 1789 a Spanish settlement and fort were built in Nootka Sound  These expeditions gave names to places such as Valdez  Bucareli Sound  and Cordova  Later  the Russian American Company carried out an expanded colonization program during the early to mid 19th century  Sitka  renamed New Archangel from 1804 to 1867  on Baranof Island in the Alexander Archipelago in what is now Southeast Alaska  became the capital of Russian America and remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the United States  The Russians never fully colonized Alaska  and the colony was never very profitable  William H  Seward  the United States Secretary of State  negotiated the Alaska Purchase  also known as Seward s Folly  with the Russians in 1867 for  7 2 million  Alaska was loosely governed by the military initially  and was administered as a district starting in 1884  with a governor appointed by the president of the United States  as well as a district court headquartered in Sitka  Miners and prospectors climb the Chilkoot Trail during the Klondike Gold Rush  For most of Alaska s first decade under the American flag  Sitka was the only community inhabited by American settlers  They organized a  provisional city government   which was Alaska s first city government  but not in a legal sense  Legislation allowing Alaskan communities to legally incorporate as cities did not come about until 1900  and home rule for cities was extremely limited or unavailable until statehood took effect  U S  Territory Starting in the 1890s and stretching in some places to the early 1910s  gold rushes in Alaska and the nearby Yukon Territory brought thousands of miners and settlers to Alaska  Alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in 1912  Alaska s capital  which had been in Sitka until the 1900 legislation mandated its transfer to Juneau  the actual move took place in 1906  after initial questions arose   began to take shape with the construction of the Alaska Governor s Mansion that same year  U S  troops negotiate snow and ice during the Battle of Attu in May 1943  During World War II  the Aleutian Islands Campaign focused on the three outer Aleutian Islands   Attu  Agattu and Kiska 24    that were invaded by Japanese troops and occupied between June 1942 and August 1943  Unalaska Dutch Harbor became a significant base for the U S  Army Air Corps and Navy submariners  The U S  Lend Lease program involved the flying of American warplanes through Canada to Fairbanks and thence Nome  Soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft  ferrying them to fight the German invasion of the Soviet Union  The construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan cities  Statehood Statehood for Alaska was an important cause of James Wickersham early in his tenure as a congressional delegate  Decades later  the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946  The Alaska Statehood Committee and Alaska s Constitutional Convention would soon follow  Statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes  mostly in the U S  Congress but also within Alaska  Statehood was approved by Congress on July 7  1958  Alaska was officially proclaimed a state on January 3  1959  On April 27  1964  the massive  Good Friday Earthquake  killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities  mainly by the resultant tsunamis and landslides  It was the third most powerful earthquake in the recorded history of the world  with a moment magnitude of 9 2  It was over one thousand times more powerful than the 1989 San Francisco earthquake  The time of day  5 36 pm   time of year and location of the epicenter were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives  particularly in Anchorage  The 1968 discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay and the 1977 completion of the Trans Alaska Pipeline led to an oil boom  Royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward  That same year  not coincidentally  Alaska repealed its state income tax  In 1989  the Exxon Valdez hit a reef in the Prince William Sound  spilling over 11 000 000 US gallons  42 000 m3  of crude oil over 1 100 miles  1 600 km  of coastline  Today  the battle between philosophies of development and conservation is seen in the contentious debate over oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  Demographics Main article  Demographics of Alaska Historical populations Census Pop     1880 33 426   1890

July 1  2011  a 1 76  increase since the 2010 United States Census  3  The United States Census Bureau  as of July 1  2008  estimated Alaska s population at 686 293  which represents an increase of 59 361  or 9 5   since the last census in 2000  26  This includes a natural increase since the last census of 60 994 people  that is 86 062 births minus 25 068 deaths  and a decrease due to net migration of 5 469 people out of the state  26 Immigration from outside the U S  resulted in a net increase of 4 418 people  and migration within the country produced a net loss of 9 887 people  26  In 2000 Alaska ranked the 48th state by population  ahead of Vermont and Wyoming  and Washington D C    27  Alaska is the least densely populated state  and one of the most sparsely populated areas in the world  at 1 0 person per square mile  0 42 km    with the next state  Wyoming  at 5 1 per square mile  1 97 km    Alaska is the largest U S  state by area  and the sixth wealthiest  per capita income   As of January 2010  the state s unemployment rate is 8 5   28  Race and ancestry According to the 2010 U S  Census  Alaska had a population of 710 231  In terms of race and ethnicity  the state was

of five speak only English at home  About 3 5  speak Spanish at home  About 2 2  speak another Indo European language at home and about 4 3  speak an Asian language at home  And about 5 3  speak other languages at home  30  A total of 5 2  of Alaskans speak one of the state s 22 indigenous languages  known locally as  native languages   These languages belong to two major language families  Eskimo Aleut and Na Dene  As the homeland of these two major language families of North America  Alaska has been described as the crossroads of the continent  providing evidence for the recent settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge  Religion St  Michael s Russian Orthodox Cathedral in Sitka  Alaska has been identified  along with Pacific Northwest states Washington and Oregon  as being the least religious in the U S  31  32  According to statistics collected by the Association of Religion Data Archives  about 39  of Alaska residents were members of religious congregations  Evangelical Protestants had 78 070 members  Roman Catholics had 54 359  and mainline Protestants had 37 156  33  After Catholicism  the largest single denominations are The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints with 30 169  34  and Southern Baptists with 22 959  The large Eastern Orthodox  with 49 parishes and up to 50 000 followers  35  population is a result of early Russian colonization and missionary work among Alaska Natives  36  In 1795  the First Russian Orthodox Church was established in Kodiak  Intermarriage with Alaskan Natives helped the Russian immigrants integrate into society  As a result  an increasing number of Russian Orthodox churches 37  gradually became established within Alaska  Alaska also has the largest Quaker population  by percentage  of any state  38  In 2009 there were 6 000 Jews in Alaska  for whom observance of the mitzvah may pose special problems   39  Estimates for the number of Alaskan Muslims range from 2 000 40  41  to 5 000  42  In 2010  the local Muslim community broke ground on the first mosque in the state  43  Alaskan Hindus often share venues and celebrations with members of other religious communities including Sikhs and Jains

40 042  ranking 15th in the nation  The oil and gas industry dominates the Alaskan economy  with more than 80  of the state s revenues derived from petroleum extraction  Alaska s main export product  excluding oil and natural gas  is seafood  primarily salmon  cod  Pollock and crab  Agriculture represents only a fraction of the Alaskan economy  Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock  dairy products  vegetables  and livestock  Manufacturing is limited  with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere  Employment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction  shipping  and transportation  Military bases are a significant component of the economy in both Fairbanks and Anchorage  Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy  allowing the state to keep taxes low  Its industrial outputs are crude petroleum  natural gas  coal  gold  precious metals  zinc and other mining  seafood processing  timber and wood products  There is also a growing service and tourism sector  Tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging  Largest employers

Pertinent are the heat pipes in the column mounts  which disperses heat upwards and prevents melting of permafrost  Alaska oil reserves peaked in 1978 and have declined 60  thereafter  Alaska oil production peaked in 1988 and has declined 65  since  Alaska has vast energy resources  Major oil and gas reserves are found in the Alaska North Slope  ANS  and Cook Inlet basins  According to the Energy Information Administration  Alaska ranks second in the nation in crude oil production  Prudhoe Bay on Alaska s North Slope is the highest yielding oil field in the United States and on North America  typically producing about 400 000 barrels per day  64 000 m3 d   The Trans Alaska Pipeline can transport and pump up to 2 1 million barrels  330 000 m3  of crude oil per day  more than any other crude oil pipeline in the United States  Additionally  substantial coal deposits are found in Alaska s bituminous  sub bituminous  and lignite coal basins  The United States Geological Survey estimates that there are 85 4 trillion cubic feet  2 420 km3  of undiscovered  technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the Alaskan North Slope  48  Alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers  Large swaths of the Alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well  49  Alaska s economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating  transportation  electric power and light  Though wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped  proposals for state wide energy systems  e g  with special low cost electric interties  were judged uneconomical  at the time of the report  2001  due to low   lt  0 50 Gal  fuel prices  long distances and low population  50  The cost of a US gallon of gas in urban Alaska today is usually  0 30  0 60 higher than the national average  prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs  seasonal usage peaks  nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors  Alaska accounts for one fifth  20 percent  citation needed  of domestically produced United States oil production  Prudhoe Bay  North America s largest oil field  alone accounts for 8  of the U S  domestic oil production  Permanent Fund The Alaska Permanent Fund is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues  established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil  largely in anticipation of same from the recently constructed Trans Alaska Pipeline System  The fund was originally proposed by Governor Keith Miller on the eve of the 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale  out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale  which amounted to  900 million  US   at once  and was later championed by Governor Jay Hammond and Kenai state representative Hugh Malone  It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since  diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund  The Alaska Constitution was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose  The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this  mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation  From its initial principal of  734 000  the fund has grown to  40 billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs  51  Most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside Alaska  This has led to frequent calls by Alaskan politicians for the Fund to make investments within Alaska  though such a stance has never really gained momentum  Starting in 1982  dividends from the fund s annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible Alaskans  ranging from an initial  1 000 00 in 1982  equal to three years  payout  as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme  to  3 269 00 in 2008  which included a one time  1 200 00  Resource Rebate    Every year  the state legislature takes out 8 percent from the earnings  puts 3 percent back into the principal for inflation proofing  and the remaining 5 percent is distributed to all qualifying Alaskans  To qualify for the Permanent Fund Dividend  one must have lived in the state for a minimum of 12 months  maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences  52  and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment  Cost of living The cost of goods in Alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous 48 states  This has changed for the most part in Anchorage and to a lesser extent in Fairbanks  where the cost of living has dropped somewhat in the past five years  Federal government employees  particularly United States Postal Service  USPS  workers and active duty military members  receive a Cost of Living Allowance usually set at 25  of base pay because  while the cost of living has gone down  it is still one of the highest in the country  The introduction of big box stores in Anchorage  Fairbanks  and Juneau also did much to lower prices  Wal Mart opened their first Anchorage store in 1993  and debuted in Fairbanks in 2004  The company currently has locations covering most of the population centers of Alaska  including Juneau  Ketchikan and Kodiak  However  rural Alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods  compared to the rest of the country due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure  Many rural residents come into these cities and purchase food and goods in bulk from warehouse clubs like Costco and Sam s Club  Some have embraced the free shipping offers 53  of some online retailers to purchase items much more cheaply than they could in their own communities  if they are available at all  Agriculture Due to the northern climate and steep terrain  relatively little farming occurs in Alaska  Most farms are in either the Matanuska Valley  about 40 miles  64 km  northeast of Anchorage  or on the Kenai Peninsula  about 60 miles  97 km  southwest of Anchorage  The short 100 day growing season limits the crops that can be grown  but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons  The primary crops are potatoes  carrots  lettuce  and cabbage  The Delta Junction area  about 100 miles  160 km  southeast of Fairbanks  also has a sizable concentration of farms  which mostly lie north and east of Fort Greely  This area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by Hammond during his second term as governor  Delta area crops consist predominately of barley and hay  Alaska  with no counties  also lacks county fairs  However  a small assortment of state and local fairs  with the Alaska State Fair in Palmer the largest   are held mostly in the late summer  The fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity  and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high profile commercial activities such as carnival rides  concerts and food   Alaska Grown  is used as an agricultural slogan  Halibut is important to the state s economy as both a commercial and sport caught fish  Alaska has an abundance of seafood  with the primary fisheries in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific  and seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it  Many Alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence  as well as sport  This includes fish taken by hook  net or wheel  54  Hunting for subsistence  primarily caribou  moose  and Dall sheep is still common in the state  particularly in remote Bush communities  An example of a traditional native food is Akutaq  the Eskimo ice cream  which can consist of reindeer fat  seal oil  dried fish meat and local berries  Alaska s reindeer herding is concentrated on Seward Peninsula where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer  55  Most food in Alaska is transported into the state from  Outside   and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive  In rural areas  subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive  The cost of importing food to villages begins at 7  per pound  15  kg  and rises rapidly to 50  per pound   1 10 kg  or more  The cost of delivering a 1 US gallon  3 8 L  of milk is about  3 50 in many villages where per capita income can be  20 000 or less  Fuel cost can exceed  8 00 per gallon  Transportation Main article  Transportation in Alaska Roads Sterling Highway  See also  List of Alaska Routes Alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the U S  The state s road system covers a relatively small area of the state  linking the central population centers and the Alaska Highway  the principal route out of the state through Canada  The state capital  Juneau  is not accessible by road  only a car ferry  which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system  or building a road connection from Haines  The western part of Alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of Alaska  The Susitna River bridge on the Denali Highway is 1 036 feet  316 m  long  One unique feature of the Alaska Highway system is the Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel  an active Alaska Railroad tunnel recently upgraded to provide a paved roadway link with the isolated community of Whittier on Prince William Sound to the Seward Highway about 50 miles  80 km  southeast of Anchorage at Portage  At 2 5 miles  4 0 km  the tunnel was the longest road tunnel in North America until 2007  56  The tunnel is the longest combination road and rail tunnel in North America  Rail Alaska Railroad  Glacier Discovery  train  Built around 1915  the Alaska Railroad  ARR  played a key role in the development of Alaska through the 20th century  It links north Pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from Seward to Interior Alaska by way of South Central Alaska  passing through Anchorage  Eklutna  Wasilla  Talkeetna  Denali  and Fairbanks  with spurs to Whittier  Palmer and North Pole  The cities  towns  villages  and region served by ARR tracks are known statewide as  The Railbelt   In recent years  the ever improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad s importance in Alaska s economy  The railroad  though famed for its summertime tour passenger service  played a vital role in Alaska s development  moving freight into Alaska while transporting natural resources southward  i e   coal from the Usibelli coal mine near Healy to Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley to Anchorage   The Alaska Railroad was one of the last railroads in North America to use cabooses in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains  It continues to offer one of the last flag stop routes in the country  A stretch of about 60 miles  100 km  of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road  the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area  until construction of the Parks Highway in the 1970s  the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route  In northern Southeast Alaska  the White Pass and Yukon Route also partly runs through the state from Skagway northwards into Canada  British Columbia and Yukon Territory   crossing the border at White Pass Summit  This line is now mainly used by tourists  often arriving by cruise liner at Skagway  It featured in the 1983 BBC television series Great Little Railways  The Alaska Rail network is not connected to Outside  In 2000  the U S  Congress authorized  6 million to study the feasibility of a rail link between Alaska  Canada  and the lower 48  57  58  59  Alaska Rail Marine provides car float service between Whittier and Seattle  Marine transport Many cities  towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access  the only modes of access involve travel by air  river  or the sea  The M V Tustumena  named after Tustumena Glacier  is one of the state s many ferries  providing service between the Kenai Peninsula and Kodiak Island  Alaska s well developed state owned ferry system  known as the Alaska Marine Highway  serves the cities of southeast  the Gulf Coast and the Alaska Peninsula  The ferries transport vehicles as well as passengers  The system also operates a ferry service from Bellingham  Washington and Prince Rupert  British Columbia in Canada through the Inside Passage to Skagway  The Inter Island Ferry Authority also serves as an important marine link for many communities in the Prince of Wales Island region of Southeast and works in concert with the Alaska Marine Highway  In recent years  cruise lines have created a summertime tourism market  mainly connecting the Pacific Northwest to Southeast Alaska and  to a lesser degree  towns along Alaska s gulf coast  The population of Ketchikan may rise by over 10 000 people on many days during the summer  as up to four large cruise ships at a time can dock  debarking thousands of passengers  Air transport Cities not served by road  sea  or river can be reached only by air  foot  dogsled  or snowmachine accounting for Alaska s extremely well developed bush air services an Alaskan novelty  Anchorage itself  and to a lesser extent Fairbanks  are served by many major airlines  Because of limited highway access  air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state  Anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism  in 2000 2001  the latest year for which data is available  2 4 million total arrivals to Alaska were counted  1 7 million by air travel  1 4 million were visitors   60  61  Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 airliner Regular flights to most villages and towns within the state that are commercially viable are challenging to provide  so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government through the Essential Air Service program  Alaska Airlines is the only major airline offering in state travel with jet service  sometimes in combination cargo and passenger Boeing 737 400s  from Anchorage and Fairbanks to regional hubs like Bethel  Nome  Kotzebue  Dillingham  Kodiak  and other larger communities as well as to major Southeast and Alaska Peninsula communities  The bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as Era Aviation  PenAir  and Frontier Flying Service  The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna Caravan  the most popular aircraft in use in the state  Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities  The program requires 70  of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities  Many communities have small air taxi services  These operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas  Perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane is the bush seaplane  The world s busiest seaplane base is Lake Hood  located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport  where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers  cargo  and many items from stores and warehouse clubs  Alaska has the highest number of pilots per capita of any U S  state  out of the estimated 663 661 residents  8 550 are pilots  or about one in 78  62  Other transport Another Alaskan transportation method is the dogsled  In modern times  that is  any time after the mid late 1920s   dog mushing is more of a sport than a true means of transportation  Various races are held around the state  but the best known is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race  a 1150 mile  1850 km  trail from Anchorage to Nome  although the distance varies from year to year  the official distance is set at 1 049 miles  1 688 km    The race commemorates the famous 1925 serum run to Nome in which mushers and dogs like Togo and Balto took much needed medicine to the diphtheria stricken community of Nome when all other means of transportation had failed  Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash  prizes  and prestige  The  Serum Run  is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous 1925 relay  leaving from the community of Nenana  southwest of Fairbanks  to Nome  63  In areas not served by road or rail  primary transportation in summer is by all terrain vehicle and in winter by snowmobile or  snow machine   as it is commonly referred to in Alaska  Data transport Alaska s internet and other data transport systems are provided largely through the two major telecommunications companies  GCI and Alaska Communications  GCI owns and operates what it calls the Alaska United Fiber Optic system 64  and as of late 2011 Alaska Communications advertised that it has  two fiber optic paths to the lower 48 and two more across Alaska  65  In January 2011  it was reported that a  1 billion project to run connect Asia and rural Alaska was being planned  aided in part by  350 million in stimulus from the federal government  66  Law and

colloquially known as the  Spam Can    the State Office Building  behind   the Alaska Office Building  the John H  Dimond State Courthouse  and the Alaska State Capitol  Many of the smaller buildings in the foreground are also occupied by state government agencies  Like all other U S  states  Alaska is governed as a republic  with three branches of government  an executive branch consisting of the Governor of Alaska and the other independently elected constitutional officers  a legislative branch consisting of the Alaska House of Representatives and Alaska Senate  and a judicial branch consisting of the Alaska Supreme Court and lower courts  The state of Alaska employs approximately 15 000 employees statewide  67  The Alaska Legislature consists of a 40 member House of Representatives and a 20 member Senate  Senators serve four year terms and House members two  The Governor of Alaska serves four year terms  The lieutenant governor runs separately from the governor in the primaries  but during the general election  the nominee for governor and nominee for lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket  Alaska s court system has four levels  the Alaska Supreme Court  the court of appeals  the superior courts and the district courts  68  The superior and district courts are trial courts  Superior courts are courts of general jurisdiction  while district courts only hear certain types of cases  including misdemeanor criminal cases and civil cases valued up to  100 000  68  The Supreme Court and the Court Of Appeals are appellate courts  The Court Of Appeals is required to hear appeals from certain lower court decisions  including those regarding criminal prosecutions  juvenile delinquency  and habeas corpus  68  The Supreme Court hears civil appeals and may in its discretion hear criminal appeals  68  State politics Further information  Political party strength in Alaska  Alaska political corruption probe Although Alaska entered the union as a Democratic state  since the early 1970s Alaska has been characterized as a Republican leaning state  69  Local political communities have often worked on issues related to land use development  fishing  tourism  and individual rights  Alaska Natives  while organized in and around their communities  have been active within the Native corporations  These have been given ownership over large tracts of land  which require stewardship  Alaska is the only state in which possession of one ounce or less of marijuana in one s home is completely legal under state law  though the federal law remains in force  70  The state has an independence movement favoring a vote on secession from the United States  with the Alaskan Independence Party  71  Six Republicans and four Democrats have served as governor of Alaska  In addition  Republican Governor Wally Hickel was elected to the office for a second term in 1990 after leaving the Republican party and briefly joining the Alaskan Independence Party ticket just long enough to be reelected  He subsequently officially rejoined the Republican party in 1994  Taxes To finance state government operations  Alaska depends primarily on petroleum revenues and federal subsidies  This allows it to have the lowest individual tax burden in the United States  72  and be one of only five states with no state sales tax  one of seven states that do not levy an individual income tax  and one of two states that has neither  The Department of Revenue Tax Division 73  reports regularly on the state s revenue sources  The Department also issues an annual summary of its operations  including new state laws that directly affect the tax division  While Alaska has no state sales tax  89 municipalities collect a local sales tax  from 1 7 5   typically 3 5   Other local taxes levied include raw fish taxes  hotel  motel  and bed and breakfast  bed  taxes  severance taxes  liquor and tobacco taxes  gaming  pull tabs  taxes  tire taxes and fuel transfer taxes  A part of the revenue collected from certain state taxes and license fees  such as petroleum  aviation motor fuel  telephone cooperative  is shared with municipalities in Alaska  Fairbanks has one of the highest property taxes in the state as no sales or income taxes are assessed in the Fairbanks North Star Borough  FNSB   A sales tax for the FNSB has been voted on many times  but has yet to be approved  leading law makers to increase taxes dramatically on other goods such as liquor and tobacco  In 2008 the Tax Foundation ranked Alaska as having

however  Republicans have carried the state by large margins  In 2008  Republican John McCain defeated Democrat Barack Obama in Alaska  59 49  to 37 83   McCain s running mate was Sarah Palin  the state s governor and the first Alaskan on a major party ticket  The Alaska Bush  central Juneau  midtown and downtown Anchorage  and the area surrounding the University of Alaska Fairbanks campus have been strongholds of the Democratic Party  Matanuska Susitna Borough and South Anchorage typically have the strongest Republican showing  As of 2004  well over half of all registered voters have chosen  Non Partisan  or  Undeclared  as their affiliation  75  despite recent attempts to close primaries  Because of its population relative to other U S  states  Alaska has only one member in the U S  House of Representatives  This seat is currently being held by Republican Don Young  who was re elected to his 19th consecutive term in 2008  Alaska s At large congressional district is currently the world s second largest legislative constituency by area  behind only the Canadian territory of Nunavut  In 2008  Governor Sarah Palin became the first Republican woman to run on a national ticket when she became John McCain s Vice Presidential running mate  She continued to be a prominent national figure even after resigning from the governor s job in July 2009  Alaska s United States Senators

is divided into boroughs  Many of the more densely populated parts of the state are part of Alaska s 16 boroughs  which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states  However  unlike county equivalents in the other 49 states  the boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state  The area not part of any borough is referred to as the Unorganized Borough  The Unorganized Borough has no government of its own  but the U S  Census Bureau in cooperation with the state divided the Unorganized Borough into 11 census areas solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation  A recording district is a mechanism for administration of the public record in Alaska  The state is divided into 34 recording districts which are centrally administered under a State Recorder  All recording districts use the same acceptance criteria  fee schedule  etc   for accepting documents into the public record  Whereas many U S  states use a three tiered system of decentralization state county township most of Alaska uses only two tiers state borough  Owing to the low population density  most of the land is located in the Unorganized Borough which  as the name implies  has no intermediate borough government of its own  but is administered directly by the state government  Currently  2000 census  57 71  of Alaska s area has this status  with 13 05  of the population  For statistical purposes the United States Census Bureau divides this territory into census areas  Anchorage merged the city government with the Greater Anchorage Area Borough in 1975 to form the

Before the force was officially organized  law enforcement in Alaska was handled by various federal agencies  Larger towns usually have their own local police and some villages rely on  Public Safety Officers  who have police training but do not carry firearms  In much of the state  the troopers serve as the only police force available  In addition to enforcing traffic and criminal law  wildlife
