Budget  25 000 000 Box office  12 729 917 Labyrinth is a 1986 British American fantasy film directed by Jim Henson  produced by George Lucas  and based off concept designs by Brian Froud  The film stars David Bowie as Jareth and Jennifer Connelly as Sarah  The plot revolves around Sarah s quest to reach the center of an enormous otherworldly maze to rescue her infant brother Toby  who has been kidnapped by Jareth  the Goblin King  With the exception of Bowie and Connelly  most of the significant characters in the film are played by puppets produced by Jim Henson s Creature Shop  Labyrinth started as a collaboration between Jim Henson and Brian Froud  with ideas for the film first being discussed between them following a screening of their previous collaboration  The Dark Crystal  Terry Jones from Monty Python wrote the first draft of the film s script early in 1984  drawing on Brian Froud s sketches for inspiration  Various other script writers  including Laura Phillips  who had previously written several episodes of Fraggle Rock   George Lucas  and Elaine May  subsequently re wrote and made additions to the screenplay  although Jones received the film s sole screen writing credit  Labyrinth was shot on location in Upper Nyack  Piermont and Haverstraw in New York  and at Elstree Studios and West Wycombe Park in the United Kingdom  The New York Times reported that Labyrinth had a budget of  25 million  Labyrinth was a box office disappointment and only grossed  12 729 917 during its U S theatrical run  The commercial failure of the film demoralized Henson to the extent that his son Brian Henson remembered the time of the film s release as one of the most difficult periods of his father s career  It would be the last feature film directed by Henson before his death in 1990  Although it was met with a mixed critical response upon its original release in the summer of 1986  Labyrinth has since gone on to become a cult film and tributes to it have been featured in magazines such as Empire and Total Film  A four volume manga sequel to the film  entitled Return to Labyrinth  was published by Tokyopop between 2006 and 2010  In 2012 Archaia Studios Press announced they were developing a graphic novel prequel to the film  Contents 1 Plot 2 Cast 2 1 Creature performers 3 Influences 4 Production 4 1 Origins and Script 4 2 Casting 4 3 Filming 4 4

final line of her monologue  the town clock chimes seven o  clock and Sarah remembers she has to babysit her brother Toby  She rushes home and has a confrontation with her impatient stepmother  Following her parents  departure Sarah realizes that her teddy bear  Lancelot  is missing from her room  She finds the toy in Toby s room and resentfully declares a wish that the goblins would take the baby away  Abruptly  Toby vanishes and a barn owl flies into the room  transforming into Jareth  King of the Goblins  David Bowie   Jareth tells Sarah that he will return her brother if she can solve his Labyrinth within thirteen hours  He transports Sarah and himself to the Labyrinth  then leaves Sarah to start her quest  At the entrance of the Labyrinth  Sarah meets Hoggle  a grumpy and obstinate dwarf who refuses to help her  She advances through the labyrinth alone and overcomes a series of obstacles during her journey  including a Knights and Knaves logic puzzle  before eventually trapping herself in an oubliette  Jareth sends Hoggle into the oubliette to free Sarah and misdirect her back to the beginning of the labyrinth  As they travel Sarah and Hoggle encounter a group of goblins tormenting a gentle beast named Ludo  whose roars frighten Hoggle and lead him to flee  Sarah saves Ludo and travels with him but the two become separated  A group of revelers with detachable limbs called the Fire Gang harass Sarah until Hoggle reappears to rescue her  Shortly afterward they pass through the Bog of Eternal Stench where they are reunited with Ludo and add another to their party  Sir Didymus  a chivalrous  fox like knight who guards the bridge that leads away from the bog  Hoggle offers Sarah a peach that Jareth had ordered him to give her  Upon biting the peach  Sarah slips into a trance and finds herself in a dream like ballroom where Jareth attempts to seduce her  The sound of a striking clock reminds Sarah that she needs to save her brother and she frees herself from the vision to restart her quest  She rejoins Ludo and Sir Didymus  and the three of them approach the Goblin City that surrounds Jareth s castle  Hoggle appears and disables a giant robot that guards the city gate  Sarah forgives Hoggle for his earlier betrayal and continues with all her friends through the city  successfully defeating the soldiers of the goblin army who have been sent to stop them  Upon reaching Jareth s throne room  Sarah decides to go forward alone  She finds Jareth and Toby in a vast  stair filled room inspired by M  C  Escher s Relativity and attempts unsuccessfully to find a path to reach her brother  She is interrupted by Jareth  who confronts her face to face and asks her to abandon her quest in order to stay with him forever  Sarah recites the complete monologue from the beginning of the film  concluding with the formerly elusive line   You have no power over me   Jareth  acknowledging defeat  returns Sarah and Toby to their home  Sarah discovers she can see Hoggle and the rest of her friends in her bedroom mirror  Sarah tells her friends she needs them  summoning them into her room  The film closes as Sarah and the creatures celebrate her victory  Outside the bedroom window  a barn owl briefly watches the party before flying away   edit  Cast Jennifer Connelly as Sarah  a teenage girl and the film s protagonist  David

Natalie Finland as the Fairies  edit  Influences A screencap from the film displaying some of the books in Sarah s room  including The Wizard of Oz  Outside Over There and Alice Through The Looking Glass Labyrinth features allusions to a range of literary and filmic sources  many of which were recognized by contemporary reviewers  Richard Corliss noted that the film appeared to have been influenced by The Wizard of Oz and the works of Maurice Sendak  writing that  Labyrinth lures a modern Dorothy Gale out of the drab Kansas of real life into a land where the wild things are   2  Nina Darnton wrote that the plot of Labyrinth  is very similar to Outside Over There by Mr  Sendak  in which 9 year old Ida s baby sister is stolen by the goblins    3  Copies of Outside Over There and Where The Wild Things Are are shown briefly in Sarah s room at the start of the film  The film also features an end credit stating that  Jim Henson acknowledges his debt to the works of Maurice Sendak   The film s concept designer Brian Froud has stated that the character of Jareth was influenced by a diverse range of literary sources  In his afterword to The Goblins of Labyrinth  Froud wrote that Jareth references  the romantic figures of Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights and a brooding Rochester from Jane Eyre  and the Scarlet Pimpernel  Bowie s costumes were intentionally eclectic  drawing on the image of Marlon Brando s leather jacket from The Wild One as well as that of a knight  with the worms of death eating through his armour  from the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm  4  The dialogue starting with  you remind me of the babe  that occurs between Jareth and the goblins in the Magic Dance sequence in the film is a direct reference to an exchange between Cary Grant and Shirley Temple in the 1947 film The Bachelor and the Bobby Soxer  5   edit  Production  edit  Origins and Script The concept painting by Brian Froud of an infant surrounded by goblins that inspired the film According to the film s conceptual designer Brian Froud  Labyrinth was first discussed between himself and director Jim Henson during a limousine ride on the way back from a special screening of their 1982 fantasy film The Dark Crystal  4  Both agreed to work on another project together  and Froud suggested that the film should feature goblins  On the same journey  Froud  pictured a baby surrounded by goblins  and this strong visual image   along with Froud s insight that goblins traditionally steal babies   provided the basis for the film s plot  6  Discussing the film s origins  Henson explained that he and Froud  wanted to do a lighter weight picture  with more of a sense of comedy since Dark Crystal got kind of heavy   heavier than we had intended  Now I wanted to do a film with the characters having more personality  and interacting more   6  Labyrinth was being seriously discussed as early as March 1983  when Henson held a meeting with Froud and children s author Dennis Lee  7  Lee was tasked with writing a novella on which a script could be based  submitting it at the end of 1983  8  Jim Henson approached Terry Jones to write the film s script as  his daughter Lisa had just read Erik the Viking and suggested that he try me as screen writer    9  Jones was given Dennis Lee s novella to use as a basis for his script  but later told Empire that Lee had produced an unfinished  poetic novella  that he  didn t really get on with   In light of this  Jones  discarded it and sat down with Brian  Froud  s drawings and sifted through them and found the ones that I really liked  and started creating the story from them   10  While Terry Jones is credited with writing the screenplay  the shooting script was actually a collaborative effort that featured contributions from Henson  George Lucas  Laura Phillips and Elaine May  Jones himself has said that the finished film differs greatly from his original vision  According to Jones   I didn t feel that it was very much mine  I always felt it fell between two stories  Jim wanted it to be one thing and I wanted it to be about something else   Jones has said his version of the script was  about the world  and about people who are more interested in manipulating the world than actually baring themselves at all   In Jones  original script  Jareth merely seems  all powerful to begin with  and is actually using the Labyrinth to  keep people from getting to his heart   9  Jones has said that David Bowie s involvement in the project had a significant impact on the direction taken with the film  Jones had originally intended for the audience not to see the center of the Labyrinth prior to Sarah s reaching it  as he felt that doing so robbed the film of a significant  hook   With the thought of Bowie starring in the film in mind  Henson decided he wanted Jareth to sing and appear throughout the film  something Jones considered to be the  wrong  decision  Despite his misgivings  Jones re wrote the script to allow for songs to be performed throughout the film  This draft of the script  went away for about a year   during which time it was re drafted first by Laura Phillips and subsequently by George Lucas  6  9  An early draft of the script attributed to Jones and Phillips is markedly different from the finished film  The early script has Jareth enter Sarah s house in the guise of Robin Zakar  the author of a play she is due to perform in  Sarah does not wish for her brother to be taken away by the goblins  and Jareth snatches him away against her will  Jareth is overtly villainous in this draft of the script  and during his final confrontation with Sarah he tells her he would  much rather have a Queen  than  a little goblin prince   The early script ends with Sarah kicking Jareth in disgust  her blows causing him to transform into a powerless  sniveling goblin  11  The re drafted script was sent to David Bowie  who found that it lacked humor and considered withdrawing his involvement in the project as a result  To ensure Bowie s involvement  Jim Henson asked Jones to  do a bit more  to the script in order to make it more humorous  9  10  Elaine May met with Henson several months prior to the start of filming in April 1985  and was asked to polish the script  May s changes  humanized the characters  and pleased Henson to the extent that they were incorporated into the film s shooting script  12  13  At least twenty five treatments and scripts were drafted for Labyrinth between 1983 and 1985  and the film s shooting script was only ready shortly before filming began  12   edit  Casting Jennifer Connelly during her audition for Labyrinth  January 1985  The protagonist of the film was  at different stages of its development  going to be a King whose baby had been put under an enchantment  a princess from a fantasy world and a young girl from Victorian England  In order to make the film more commercial  it was ultimately decided that the film s lead would be a teenage girl from contemporary America  Henson noted that he wished to  make the idea of taking responsibility for one s life   which is one of the neat realizations a teenager experiences   a central thought of the film   6  Auditions for the lead role of Sarah began in England in April 1984  Helena Bonham Carter auditioned for the part  but it was ultimately decided it would be better to cast an American actress  Monthly auditions were held in the U S until January 1985  and Jane Krakowski  Yasmine Bleeth  Sarah Jessica Parker  Marisa Tomei  Laura Dern  Ally Sheedy  Maddie Corman and Mia Sara all auditioned for the role  Of these  Krakowski  Sheedy and Corman were considered to be the top candidates  Fourteen year old actress Jennifer Connelly was ultimately chosen to play Sarah after her audition on January 29  1985   won Jim  Henson  over  and led him to cast her within a week  12  According to Henson  Connelly was chosen as she  could act that kind of dawn twilight time between childhood and womanhood   14  Connelly moved to England in February 1985 in advance of the film s rehearsals  which began in March  12  Discussing her understanding of her role with Elle  Connelly said that the film is about  a young girl growing out of her childhood  who is just now becoming aware of the responsibilities that come with growing up   15  The character of Jareth also underwent some significant developments during the early stages of pre production  According to Henson he was originally meant to be another puppet creature in the same vein as his goblin subjects  6  Henson eventually decided he wanted a big  charismatic star to the play the Goblin King  and decided to pursue a musician for the role  Sting and Michael Jackson were both considered for the part  however it was ultimately decided that David Bowie would be the most suitable choice  16   I wanted to put two characters of flesh and bone in the middle of all these artificial creatures   Henson explained   and David Bowie embodies a certain maturity  with his sexuality  his disturbing aspect  all sorts of things that characterize the adult world   17  Henson met David Bowie in the summer of 1983 to seek his involvement  as Bowie was in the U S for his Serious Moonlight Tour at the time  18  Henson continued to pursue Bowie for the role of Jareth  and sent him each revised draft of the script of the film  During a meeting that took place on June 18  1984  Henson showed Bowie The Dark Crystal and a selection of Brian Froud s concept drawings to pique his interest in the project  19  Bowie formally agreed to take part on February 15  1985  several months before filming was due to begin  6  19  Discussing why he chose to be involved in the film  Bowie explained that  I d always wanted to be involved in the music writing aspect of a movie that would appeal to children of all ages  as well as everyone else  and I must say that Jim gave me a completely free hand with it  The script itself was terribly amusing without being vicious or spiteful or bloody  and it had a lot more heart in it than many other special effects movies  So I was pretty hooked from the beginning   20   edit  Filming Karen Prell and Kevin Clash during the filming of Labyrinth  Labyrinth began shooting on April 15  1985  at Elstree Studios  21  The team that worked on Labyrinth was largely assembled from talent who had been involved in various other projects with the Jim Henson company  Veteran performers Frank Oz and Dave Goelz operated various puppets in the film  as did Karen Prell  Ron Mueck and Rob Mills who had all worked with Henson on Fraggle Rock  Kevin Clash  who had previously been a crew member on Sesame Street  also worked on the film  Members of Henson s family also worked on the production  including son Brian Henson and daughter Cheryl Henson  Newcomers working on the production included puppeteer Anthony Asbury  who had previously worked on the satirical puppet show Spitting Image  Labyrinth took five months to film  and was a complicated shoot due to the myriad of puppets and animatronic creatures involved  In the making of documentary Inside the Labyrinth  Henson stated that although Jim Henson s Creature Shop had been building the puppets and characters required for around a year and a half prior to shooting   everything came together in the last couple weeks   Henson noted that  even if you have the characters together  the puppeteers start working with them  they find problems or they try to figure out what they re going to do with these characters   16  Although each of the film s key puppets required a small team of puppeteers to operate it  the most complex puppet of the production was Hoggle  Shari Weiser was inside the costume  while Hoggle s face was radio controlled by Brian Henson and three other operators  Speaking in the Inside the Labyrinth documentary  Brian Henson explained that Weiser  does all the body movement and her head is inside the head  However  the jaw is not connected to her jaw  Nothing that the face is doing has any connection with what she s doing with her face  The other four members of the crew are all radio crew  myself included   Speaking of the challenges involved with performing Hoggle  Brian Henson said that  five performers trying to get one character out of one puppet was a very tough thing  Basically what it takes is a lot of rehearsing and getting to know each other   16  At the early stages of filming  stars Connelly and Bowie found it difficult to interact naturally with the puppets they shared most of their scenes with  Bowie told Movieline  I had some initial problems working with Hoggle and the rest because  for one thing  what they say doesn t come from their mouths  but from the side of the set  or from behind you   20  Connelly remarked that  it was a bit strange  working almost exclusively with puppets in the film   but I think both Dave  Bowie  and I got over that and just took it as a challenge to work with these puppets  And by the end of the film  it wasn t a challenge anymore  They were there  and they were their characters   22  The film required large and ambitious sets to be constructed  from the Shaft of Hands to the rambling  distorted Goblin City where the film s climatic battle takes place  The Shaft of Hands sequence was filmed on a rig that was roughly forty feet high  and required nearly a hundred performers to operate the grey  scaly hands integral to the scene  Connelly was strapped into a harness when shooting the scene  and would spend time between takes suspended mid way up the shaft  16  The set of the Goblin City was built on Stage 6 at Thorn EMI Elstree Studios in London  and required the largest panoramic back cloth ever made  According to Production Designer Elliot Scott  the biggest challenge he faced was building the forest Sarah and her party pass through on their way to Jareth s Castle  The film s production notes state that  the entire forest required 120 truckloads of tree branches  1 200 turfs of grass  850 pounds of dried leaves  133 bags of lichen  and 35 bundles of mossy old man s beard   14  While most filming was conducted at Elstree Studios  a small amount of location shooting was carried out in England and the U S  The park seen at the start of the film is West Wycombe Park in Buckinghamshire  England  The scenes of Sarah running back home were filmed in various towns in New York  namely North Nyack  Piermont and Haverstraw  23  24  Principal photography on Labyrinth wrapped on September 8 1985  25   edit  Post Production Most of the visual effects in Labyrinth were achieved in camera  with several notable exceptions  The most prominent of these post production effects was the computer generated owl that appears at the opening of the film  The sequence was created by animators Larry Yaeger and Bill Kroyer  26  27  and marked the first use of a realistic CGI animal in a film  28  29  The scene where Sarah encounters the Fire Gang had to be altered in post production as it had been filmed against black velvet cloth  and a new forest background was added  Jim Henson was unhappy with the compositing of the finished scene  although he considered the puppetry featured in it worthy of inclusion  17  Jim Henson received help editing the film from executive producer George Lucas  According to Henson   When we hit the editing  I did the first cut  and then George was heavily involved on bringing it to the final cut  After that  I took it over again and did the next few months of post production and audio   Henson went on to explain that  When you edit a film with somebody else you have to compromise  I always want to go one way  and George goes another way  but we each took turns trading off  giving and taking  George tends to be very action oriented and he cuts dialogue quite tight  I tend to cut looser  and go for more lyrical pauses  which can slow the story  So  I loosen up his tightness  and he tightens my looseness   6   edit  Soundtrack The soundtrack album features Trevor Jones  score  which is split into six tracks for the soundtrack   Into the Labyrinth    Sarah    Hallucination    The Goblin Battle    Thirteen O Clock  and  Home at Last   David Bowie recorded five songs for the film   Underground    Magic Dance    Chilly Down    As the World Falls Down  and  Within You    Underground  features on the soundtrack twice  first in an edited version that was played over the film s opening sequence and secondly in full   Underground  was released in various territories as a single  and in certain markets was also released in an instrumental version and an extended dance mix  30   Magic Dance  was released as a 12  single in the U S  31   As the World Falls Down  was initially slated for release as a follow up single to  Underground  in Christmas 1986  but this plan did not materialize  32  The only song Bowie did not perform lead vocal on is  Chilly Down   which was performed by Charles Augins  Richard Bodkin  Kevin Clash and Danny John Jules  the actors who voiced the  Firey  creatures in the film  33  Steve Barron produced promotional music videos for  Underground  and  As the World Falls Down   The music video for  Underground  features Bowie as a night club singer who stumbles upon the world of the Labyrinth  encountering many of the creatures seen in the film  The clip for  As the World Falls Down  integrates clips from the film  using them alongside black and white shots of Bowie performing the song in an elegant room   edit  Release Princess Diana with Jim Henson at the Royal Premier of Labyrinth   edit  Promotion The production of Labyrinth was covered in multiple high profile magazines and newspapers in anticipation of its release  with articles appearing in The New York Times  Time and Starlog magazine  34  35  6  An article that appeared in The New York Times shortly after filming wrapped in September 1985 focused heavily on the film s large scale  emphasizing the size of the production and selling the film as a more  accessible  production than The Dark Crystal due to the casting of live actors in its key roles  34  An hour long making of documentary that covered the filming of Labyrinth and included interviews with the key figures involved in its production was broadcast on television as Inside the Labyrinth  36  Labyrinth was featured in music trade papers such as Billboard due to David Bowie s soundtrack for the film  37  Bowie was not heavily involved in promoting the film but Jim Henson was nonetheless grateful that he produced a music video to accompany the song  Underground  from the soundtrack  saying  I think it s the best thing he could have done for the film   38  A range of merchandise was produced to accompany the film s release  including plush toys of Sir Didymus and Ludo  a board game  computer game and multiple jigsaw puzzles  An exhibition of the film s characters and sets toured across shopping malls in various cities in the U S  including New York  Dallas and Chicago  Labyrinth was featured in an exhibition titled  Jim Henson s Magic World  that was shown at the Seibu Department Store in Tokyo in August 1986  39   edit  Theatrical Release Labyrinth received its U S premier on June 27

members including Warwick Davis  50   edit  Reception  edit  Critical Reception  As he did with less success in The Dark Crystal  Mr  Henson uses the art of puppetry to create visual effects that until very recently were possible to attain only with animation  The result is really quite startling  It removes storyboard creations from the flat celluloid cartoon image and makes them three dimensional  so that they actually come alive and interact with living people  The technique makes animation seem dull and old fashioned by comparison     Nina Darnton of The New York Times on Labyrinth s technical achievements  3  The film received mixed reviews from critics  51  On Rotten Tomatoes  the film averages a 62  positive rating  52  On Metacritic  which uses a  weighted average  of all the critics  scores  Labyrinth scores 50 out of 100  53  While acknowledging that Labyrinth was made with  infinite care and pains   Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four as he felt that the film  never really comes alive   Ebert said that as the film was set in an  arbitrary world  none of the events in it had any consequences  robbing the film of any dramatic tension  54 Gene Siskel s review of Labyrinth for the Chicago Tribune was highly negative  and he referred to it as an  awful  film with a  pathetic story    much too complicated plot  and a  visually ugly style   Siskel objected to the film s  violent  plot  writing that  the sight of a baby in peril is one of sleaziest gimmicks a film can employ to gain our attention  but Henson does it    55  Other critics were more positive  Kathryn Buxton found that it had  excitement and thrills enough for audiences of all ages as well as a fun and sometimes slightly naughty sense of humour   56  Bruce Bailey admired the film s script  stating that  Terry Jones has drawn on his dry wit and bizarre imagination and come up with a script that transforms these essentially familiar elements and plot structures into something that fairly throbs with new life   Bailey was also impressed by the film s depth  writing that  adults will have the additional advantage of appreciating the story as a coming of age parable   57  Several critics noted the film s subtext  and found it successful to varying degrees  Saw Tek Meng acknowledged that  Sarah s experiences in the labyrinth are symbolic of her transition from child to woman  but ultimately found the film  too linear  for its latent themes to come through  58  Nina Darnton compared the film s tone to the writings of E T A  Hoffman  stating that Hoffman s The Nutcracker  is also about the voyage to womanhood  including the hint of sexual awakening  which Sarah experiences too in the presence of a goblin king   Darton enjoyed the film and considered it to be more successful than Henson s previous collaboration with Brian Froud  The Dark Crystal  3  Jennifer Connelly s portrayal of Sarah polarized critics and received strong criticism from some reviewers  Critic Kirk Honeycutt referred to Connelly as  a bland and minimally talented young actress  59  Writing for The Miami News  Jon Marlowe stated that  Connelly is simply the wrong person for the right job  She has a squeaky voice that begins to grate on you  when she cries  you can see the onions in her eyes   60  Contrary to these negative views  an anonymous review in St  Petersburg Times praised her acting saying that  Connelly makes the entire experience seem real  She acts so naturally around the puppets that you begin to believe in their life like qualities   61  Bowie s performance was variously lauded and derided  In his largely positive review of the film  Richard Corliss praised him as  charismatic  referring to his character as a  Kabuki sorcerer who offers his ravishing young antagonist the gilded perks of adult servitude   2  Bruce Bailey enjoyed Bowie s performance  writing that  the casting of Bowie can t be faulted on any count  He has just the right look for a creature who s the object of both loathing and secret desire   57  In a largely critical review  the St  Petersburg Times found that  Bowie forgoes acting  preferring to prance around his lair while staring solemnly into the camera  He s not exactly wooden  Plastic might be a more accurate description   61  The film s mixed reviews and poor box office takings demoralized Jim Henson to the extent that his son Brian remembered the time of the film s release as being  the closest I ve seen him to turning in on himself and getting quite depressed   It would be the last feature film directed by Henson before his death in 1990  62  Since Jim Henson s death  Labyrinth has been re evaluated by several notable critics  A review from 2000 in Empire magazine called the film  a fabulous fantasy  and wrote that  David Bowie cuts a spooky enough figure in that fright wig to fit right in with this extraordinary menagerie of Goth Muppets  And Jennifer Connelly  still in the flush of youth  makes for an appealingly together kind of heroine   63  Writing for the Chicago Tribune in 2007  Michael Wilmington described Labyrinth as  dazzling   writing that it is  a real masterpiece of puppetry and special effects  an absolutely gorgeous children s fantasy movie   64  In 2010 Total Film ran a feature called  Why We Love Labyrinth  which described Labyrinth as a  hyper real  vibrant daydream  Labyrinth s main strength lies in its fairytale roots  which give the fantastical story a platform from which to launch into some deliriously outlandish scenarios   65  In their February 2012 issue  Empire featured a four page spread on Labyrinth as part of their Muppet Special  10   edit  Legacy Despite its poor performance at the American box office  Labyrinth was a success on home video and later on DVD   66  David Bowie told an interviewer in 1992 that  every Christmas a new flock of children comes up to me and says   Oh  you re the one who s in Labyrinth    67  In 1997  Jennifer Connelly said  I still get recognized for Labyrinth by little girls in the weirdest places  I can t believe they still recognize me from that movie  It s on TV all the time and I guess I pretty much look the same   68  Labyrinth has become a cult film  69  Brian Henson remembered his father Jim Henson as being aware that Labyrinth and The Dark Crystal both had cult followings by the time of his death in 1990  saying that  he was able to see all that and know that it was appreciated   70  Academic Andrea Wright has wrote that Labyrinth has managed to maintain audience popularity long after its initial release to a greater extent than The Dark Crystal  39  Since 1997  an annual two day masquerade ball called the  Labyrinth of Jareth  where revelers come dressed in costumes inspired by the film has been held in Hollywood  CA  71  72 Labyrinth has a significant Internet fandom  and as of February 4  2012  Fanfiction Net hosts 7263 stories in its Labyrinth section  73  The strong DVD sales of Labyrinth promoted rights holders the Jim Henson Company and Sony Pictures to look into making a sequel  66  and Curse of the Goblin King was briefly used as a place holder title  74  The decision was ultimately taken to avoid making a direct sequel  and instead produce a fantasy film with a similar atmosphere  Fantasy author Neil Gaiman and artist Dave McKean were called in to write and direct a film similar in spirit to Labyrinth  and MirrorMask was ultimately released in selected theaters in 2005 after premiering at the Sundance Film Festival  66   edit  In Other Media Since the initial release of the film  Labyrinth has been translated to other forms of media  The film was novelized by A C H  Smith as Labyrinth  A Novel Based On The Jim Henson Film  which is currently out of print  75  A three issue comic book adaptation  which was first released in a single volume as Marvel Super Special  40  was published by Marvel Comics  Tokyopop  in partnership with The Jim Henson Company  published a manga style four volume comic called Return to Labyrinth  written by Jake T  Forbes  illustrated by Chris Lie  with cover art by Kouyu Shurei  76 Return to Labyrinth follows the adventures of Toby as a teenager  when he is tricked into returning to the Labyrinth by Jareth  77  The first volume was released August 8  2006  with a second following on October 9  2007 and a third on May 1  2009  In an afterword to the second volume  editor Tim Beedle announced that the series  originally planned as a trilogy  was being extended to include a fourth volume  The fourth and final volume of Return to Labyrinth was released on August 3  2010  Archaia Entertainment  in collaboration with The Jim Henson Company  is developing a prequel comic book about the story of how Jareth became the Goblin King  78  Project editor Stephen Christy has stated the graphic novel will be a  tragic story   While it is still in the early stages of development  there are plans for the novel to integrate music into the plot in some way  David Bowie is being approached by Archaia Comics in order to seek permission to use his likeness  and ascertain if he wishes to have any involvement in the project  79  Brian Froud is serving as a creative consultant on the project  Froud will be producing covers for the series  as well as character designs  79  Archaia will also be releasing a Labyrinth short story titled Hoggle and the Worm for Free Comic Book Day on May 5  2012  80  In addition to these print media tie ins  a Muppet Babies episode with a similar plot   Nice to Have Gnome You   incorporates clips from the film and features Miss Piggy going on a quest to recover her copy of Alice s Adventures In Wonderland  81  The film was also adapted for Commodore 64 and Apple II video game consoles in 1986 as  Labyrinth  The Computer Game   Different versions were also released in Japan the following year for the Nintendo Famicom and MSX consoles  under the title  Labyrinth  Maou no Meikyuu   82   edit  Notes    Michael Moschen Official Biography   MichaelMoschen com  http   www michaelmoschen com bio html  Retrieved January 25  2012     a b Corliss
