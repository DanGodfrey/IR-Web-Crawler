considered depending on the success of Wolverine  32  In 2006  a film based on Emma Frost was being considered with director David O  Russell as a potential spin off from the film series  19   edit  The Wolverine  2013  I won t lie to you  I have been talking to writers  I m a big fan of the Japanese saga in the comic book      Hugh Jackman 33  In September 2009  Gavin Hood speculated that there will be a sequel to X Men Origins  Wolverine  which will be set in Japan  34  During one of the post credits scenes Logan is seen drinking at a bar in Japan  Such a location was the subject of Claremont and Miller s series  which was not in the first film as Jackman felt  what we need to do is establish who  Logan  is and find out how he became Wolverine   35  Jackman stated the Claremont Miller series is his favorite Wolverine story  36  Of the Japanese arc  Jackman also stated that      there are so many areas of that Japanese story  I love the idea of this kind of anarchic character  the outsider  being in this world   I can see it aesthetically  too   full of honor and tradition and customs and someone who s really anti all of that  and trying to negotiate his way  The idea of the samurai  too   and the tradition there  It s really great  In the comic book he gets his ass kicked by a couple of samurai   not even mutants  He s shocked by that at first  33    Jackman added that another Wolverine film would be a follow up rather than continuing on from X Men  The Last Stand  37  The inclusion of Deadpool and Gambit also leads to the possibilities of their own spin offs  38  Before Wolverine s release  Lauren Shuler Donner approached Simon Beaufoy to write the script  but he did not feel confident enough to commit  39  On May 5  2009  just four days after its initial weekend run  the sequel was officially confirmed  40  A Deadpool spin off has also been confirmed with Ryan Reynolds attached to reprise the role of Wade Wilson  41  but producer Shuler Donner stated that she wants to  ignore the version of Deadpool that we saw in Wolverine and just start over again  Reboot it   42  Christopher McQuarrie  who went uncredited for his work on X Men  was hired to write the screenplay for the Wolverine sequel in August 2009  43  According to Lauren Shuler Donner  the sequel will focus on the relationship between Wolverine and Mariko  the daughter of a Japanese crime lord  and what happens to him in Japan  Wolverine will have a different fighting style due to Mariko s father having  this stick like weapon  There ll be samurai  ninja  katana blades  different forms of martial arts   mano a mano  extreme fighting   She continued   We want to make it authentic so I think it s very likely we ll be shooting in Japan  I think it s likely the characters will speak English rather than Japanese with subtitles   44  In January 2010  at the People s Choice Awards  Jackman stated that the film will start shooting sometime in 2011  45  and in March 2010 McQuarrie declared that the screenplay was finished for production to start in January the following year  46  In October 2010  it was confirmed that Darren Aronofsky would direct the film  47  Jackman commented that with Darren Aronofsky directing that Wolverine 2 will not be  usual  stating   This is  hopefully for me  going to be out of the box  It s going to be the best one  I hope    Well  I would say that  but I really do feel that  and I feel this is going to be very different  This is Wolverine  This is not Popeye  He s kind of dark    But  you know  this is a change of pace  Chris McQuarrie  who wrote The Usual Suspects  has written the script  so that ll give you a good clue   Aronofsky s  going to make it fantastic  There s going to be some meat on the bones  There will be something to think about as you leave the theater  for sure   48  Bryan Singer was invited by Shuler Donner to direct  but declined  49  In November 2010  Aronofsky stated that the title of the film will be The Wolverine and described the film as a  one off  rather than a sequel  50  Also in November  Fox Filmed Entertainment sent out a press release stating that they have signed Darren Aronofsky and his production company Protozoa Pictures to a new two year  overall deal  Under the deal  Protozoa will develop and produce films for both 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight Pictures  Aronofsky s debut picture under the pact will be The Wolverine  51  It had been reported that the film would begin principal photography in March 2011 in New York City before the production moves to Japan for the bulk of shooting  52  In March 2011  Darren Aronofsky bowed out of directing the film  saying the project would keep him out of the country for too long  In a joint statement with Fox  Aronofsky stated   As I talked more about the film with my collaborators at Fox  it became clear that the production of The Wolverine would keep me out of the country for almost a year    I was not comfortable being away from my family for that length of time  I am sad that I won t be able to see the project through  as it is a terrific script and I was very much looking forward to working with my friend  Hugh Jackman  again   53  Fox also decided to be  in no rush  to start the production due to the damage incurred in Japan by the 2011 T hoku earthquake and tsunami  54  On June 16  2011 James Mangold was chosen to direct the film  55  having previously been on a shortlist which included directors Jos  Padilha  Doug Liman  Antoine Fuqua  Mark Romanek  Justin Lin  and Gavin O Connor  56  On June 27  Jackman said in an interview that filming for The Wolverine would start in October  57 Silver Samurai will be the film s villain  58  In September 2011  filming was postponed to Spring 2012 so Jackman can work on Les Mis rables  59  Location include both Vancouver and Tokyo  with Mark Bomback working on a rewrite of McQuarrie s script  60  A July 26  2013 release date has been set  61   edit  Deadpool  2014  As far back as 2003  New Line Cinema was attempting to produce a Deadpool spin off  When working out the deal with Marvel over the film rights  strict limitations were set in place  New Line was not allowed to connect Deadpool to the other X Men films  62  In February 2004  writer director David S  Goyer was working on the spin off with Ryan Reynolds in the title role   We would completely reinvent it   Goyer explained   We can t connect it to Weapon X or anything like that  We ll see   63  However  by August 2004  Goyer lost interest in favor of other projects  64  but Reynolds remained interested   It s still being talked about   the actor said in October 2004   Avi Arad loves it   65  In March 2005  20th Century Fox became interested in moving forward on production for Deadpool after New Line Cinema put the project in turnaround  66  The studio continued to consider the Deadpool spin off early in the development of X Men Origins  Wolverine  which is why Reynolds was cast for the role  62  After the opening weekend success of Wolverine  Fox announced on May 5  2009 that they were lending Deadpool  out to writers  with Lauren Shuler Donner and Marvel Studios acting as producers  67  Reynolds emphasized that he  Donner  and 20th Century Fox are working to ensure that Deadpool remains loyal as possible to the comic book   The studio s working on a script and trying to find a director   the actor explained in July 2009   The main goal is to make sure it stays close to the source material   68  Donner met with Deadpool creator Rob Liefeld to discuss the planned direction of the film in September 2009  69  Donner stated that she wants the film to  ignore the version of Deadpool that we saw in Wolverine and just start over again  Reboot it  Because this guy talks  obviously  and to muzzle him would be insane   She also confirmed that Deadpool will have the attributes that the character has in the comics  such as breaking the fourth wall  42 Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick were hired to write the script in January 2010  70 Robert Rodriguez was sent an early draft of the screenplay in June 2010  Although he liked the casting choice of Reynolds and the script itself  Rodriguez explained   I ve been really swamped with this other stuff  I ve not decided whether     anything I do would be after Spy Kids   that gives some breathing room  So whether or not I would help develop or not is the question right now   71  The Los Angeles Times reported that Rodriguez and Fox were negotiating over several key points  but added that Rodriguez would not start filming for Deadpool until he finishes Spy Kids  All the Time in the World  72  After negotiations with Rodriguez fell through  Adam Berg emerged as a top contender for the director s chair  73  Reynolds is still attached  and filming is scheduled to begin in 2012  74  On April 7  2011 it was announced that VFX specialist Tim Miller would be directing  75   edit  Sequels to X Men  First Class Fox envisions X Men  First Class as the first film of a new trilogy  29  Lauren Shuler Donner compared the franchise plans to be similar to the darker  more mature content of the Harry Potter film series  76 Matthew Vaughn and Bryan Singer will return to direct and produce the sequel  respectively  77  While speaking about the sequels  director Vaughn said   First Class is similar to Batman Begins  where you have the fun of introducing the characters and getting to know them  but that takes time  But with the second one  you can just get on with it and have a rollicking good time  That s the main difference between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight   78  In a new chat about the film  Vaughn threw around a few ideas regarding a possible sequel to the prequel  On how First Class 2 could open  Vaughn said   I thought it would be fun to open with the Kennedy Assassination  and we reveal that the magic bullet was controlled by Magneto   Continuing that a First Class 2 would not necessarily follow the traditional comic book sequel route of adding more characters to its roster  Vaughn added   We will only have one more new character  I won t say who he  I won t say who he or she is  But we will only be bringing one more new character in  because  I think  as Professor X is in a wheelchair  Magneto needs to have a nemesis he can fight with  Someone that will be his equal  I know who it is  It would be nice if I could say something  but I can t  mate   79  Vaughn has speculated that a sequel could be set in  in the latter part of the 1960s where you ve got The Stones  The Beatles  Flower Power   80  Actor James McAvoy said he has a contract for three movies  81  and expressed interest in seeing Charles Xavier get  really messed up  in the sequel and speculated that a third film could show his transition into a character closer to the one played by Patrick Stewart in the original trilogy  80 Michael Fassbender has said that he is  very excited  about the possibility of a sequel  82  He has said   We worked very hard  It was a very trying time  Thank God  James is a good guy a very smart guy and he s a very practical guy  Matthew s great because he makes films as a fan  There s something like a nine year old boy in him when he s making a film  He s very much into characters and allowing the characters to drive the plot and the plot to drive the action film  as opposed to action driving the film and threading in some sort of a plot  It was a very rewarding experience  so hopefully we ll get the same team back again   83  Producer Lauren Shuler Donner has said that the sequel may be set in the 1970s  84  Writer and executive producer Bryan Singer has stated that it could be set around the Civil rights movement or the Vietnam War  85  and that Wolverine could once again be featured  86 Hugh Jackman has said that he would like to return  87 Simon Kinberg who co wrote X Men  The Last Stand and co produced X Men  First Class will write the sequel  88  Actress Jennifer Lawrence has expressed interest in reprising her role as Mystique in a sequel  89 Rose Byrne and  lex Gonz lez revealed that they had signed on for one or two more films in the X Men franchise  90  91 January Jones has said that she would love to do another film  92 Lucas Till has said that he would like to reprise the role of Havok  93 Jason Flemyng has expressed interest in exploring the origins of Nightcrawler  94  McAvoy added he wants to portray the psychological transformations Xavier suffers   He can t just become the guy that we saw in the first three movies  He just had two major things happen to him  He s lost his best friend  essentially  and he s just been paralyzed from the waist down  Which is just a huge  huge blow to his considerable ego  So he s got to deal with that   95   edit  Potential sequels to the main series Producer Lauren Shuler Donner reported in August 2006 that renegotiations would be required to continue the main film series  Newer cast members were signed  while the older cast members  including Halle Berry  Rebecca Romijn  Famke Janssen  and Anna Paquin  were not  96  Berry  James Marsden  97  and Patrick Stewart 98  have expressed interest in returning  and Bryan Singer was approached once more to direct  but he was busy  99 Shawn Ashmore stated that he is still contracted for another film featuring Iceman  100 Tyler Mane and Ray Park have both expressed interest in reprising their roles from X Men as Sabretooth and Toad  respectively  in future films  although it is unlikely Mane would be asked due to Liev Schreiber taking over the Sabretooth role in X Men Origins  Wolverine and his commitment to the Halloween franchise  however  as of July 2007  there was no script for a fourth film  and none was in the works  101  Later in the month  however  Kevin Feige  president of production at Marvel Studios said that another X Men film was possible  102  Donner admitted   There is forty years worth of stories  I ve always wanted to do  Days of Future Past  and there are just really a lot of stories yet to be told   103  At a Fox Blu ray press event in Beverly Hills in September 2009  Lauren Shuler Donner stated that she is currently  cooking up plans for  an X Men 4  However she stressed that it has yet to be pitched to the studio  31  Shuler Donner later pitched Bryan Singer on doing a fourth installment of the previously established X Men franchise  following the completion of X Men  First Class  49  In March 2011  Shuler Donner revealed that the film was in  active development at Fox   saying   We took the treatment to Fox and they love it    And X4 leads into X5   104   edit  Unproduced prequel  edit  X Men Origins  Magneto In December 2004  20th Century Fox hired screenwriter Sheldon Turner to draft a spin off X Men film  and he chose to write Magneto  pitching it as  The Pianist meets X Men   105  In April 2007  David S  Goyer was hired to direct  106  Turner said the script was set from 1939 to 1955  107  and it follows Magneto trying to survive in Auschwitz  He meets Xavier  a young soldier  during the liberation of the camp  He hunts down the Nazi war criminals who tortured him  and this lust for vengeance turns him and Xavier into enemies  106  In May 2006  Ian McKellen said he would reprise the role using the computer generated facelift applied to him in the prologue of X Men  The Last Stand  108 Lauren Shuler Donner stated that the film would need McKellen to anchor the story  which would take place in flashbacks  19  With Goyer s hiring in 2007  it was said actors in their twenties would play the characters  106  McKellen reiterated his hope to open and close the film in July 2008  109  The film was planned to shoot in Australia for a 2009 release  110  111  but it was delayed by the 2007 2008 Writers Guild of America strike  112  In April 2008  concept art  including one of a younger Beast  was being designed  113  In June 2008 the X Men Origins prefix also applied to Wolverine was confirmed  and the project was seeking approval to film in Washington  D C  114  By December 2008  Goyer said filming would begin if Wolverine was successful  The story was moved forward to 1962  and involves Xavier and Magneto battling a villain  115  Ian McKellen confirmed that he would not be reprising his role as Magneto  citing his age as a barrier  116  In 2009  X Men s producer Lauren Shuler Donner stated that the movie may never be made  117  Donner also said that  the studio has a wealth of potential stories  and they have to stand back and decide which ones to make  And Magneto  I think  is at the back of the queue  Maybe it ll get made in five years   who knows   118  Both Donner and Bryan Singer have stated that Magneto will probably not be produced  as the plot of X Men  First Class  supersedes  the story of the planned film  119  120  After X Men  First Class was released in 2011  it became official that a Magneto spin off prequel was no longer planned   edit  Cast Main article  List of X Men films cast members  edit  Reception  edit  Box office performance Film Release date Box office revenue

Globe praised the X Men films as  more than a cash guzzling wham bang Hollywood franchise    these three movies sport philosophy  ideas  a telethon load of causes  and a highly elastic us versus them allegory   Morris praised X Men  The Last Stand for  put ting  the heroes of a mighty summer blockbuster in a rare mortal position  Realism at this time of year  How unorthodox   152 Roger Ebert gave the films good reviews  but criticized them because  there are just plain too many mutants  and their powers are so various and ill matched that it s hard to keep them all on the same canvas   153  Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle  criticized the films  themes  saying  The pretensions take the form of the central metaphor that compares mutants to people of extraordinary  groundbreaking talent  That metaphor is bogus    The vision at the heart of X Men   of a golden Utopia in which humans live side by side with mutants   is absurd   154  The first two films were highly praised due to their cerebral tone  but when director Bryan Singer left  many criticized his successor Brett Ratner  Colin Colvert of the Star Tribune felt  Bryan Singer s sensitivity to  the discrimination themes  made the first two X Men films surprisingly resonant and soulful for comic based summer extravaganzas    Singer is adept at juggling large casts of three dimensional characters  Ratner makes shallow  unimaginative bang ups   155 James Berardinelli felt   X Men  The Last Stand isn t as taut or satisfying as X Men 2  but it s better constructed and better paced than the original X Men  The differences in quality between the three are minor  however  despite the change in directors  there seems to be a single vision   156  David Denby of The New Yorker praised  the liquid beauty and the poetic fantasy of Singer s work   but called Ratner s film  a crude synthesizer of comedy and action tropes   157  The X Men films received good reviews from fans of the comic books  but there was criticism of the large cast  and the limited screentime for all of them  Richard George of IGN praised the depictions of Wolverine  Professor X  Magneto  Jean Grey  Storm  William Stryker  Mystique  Beast and Nightcrawler  however  George thought many of the younger X Men characters  such as Rogue  Iceman  Pyro  and Kitty Pryde were  adjectiveless teenager s    and was disappointed by Cyclops  characterization  He observed the filmmakers were  big fans of silent henchmen   due to the small roles of the various villainous mutants  such as Lady Deathstrike  George thought that the success of X Men  paved the way for other hits like the Spider Man series  Fantastic Four  V for Vendetta and Singer s own adaptation of Superman   158 Spider Man director Sam Raimi said he was a fan of the series  particularly Singer s films  159  Film historian Kim Newman also tonally compared Batman Begins to Singer s films  160   edit  Tie in material On June 1  2000  Marvel published a comic book prequel to X Men  titled X Men  Beginnings  revealing the backstories of Magneto  Rogue and Wolverine  161  There was also an adaptation of the film  162  Marvel also released an adaptation of X2  which also contained prequels detailing Nightcrawler s backstory and Wolverine s time searching for Alkali Lake  163 Del Rey Books also published novelizations of the three films  The latter two were written by Chris Claremont  164  165  166  In 2006  X Men  The Official Game was released  which was set between X2 and X Men  The Last Stand  167   edit  References   a b  Film
