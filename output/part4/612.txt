discretion of each state or local jurisdiction to determine official holiday schedules  There are eleven such federal holidays  ten annual and one quadrennial holiday  2  The annual federal holidays are widely observed by state and local governments  however  they may alter the dates of observance or add or subtract holidays according to local custom  Pursuant to the Uniform Monday Holiday Act of 1968  taking effect in 1971   official holidays are observed on a Monday  except for New Year s Day  Independence Day  Veterans Day  Thanksgiving  and Christmas  3  There are also U S  state holidays particular to individual U S  states  such as Good Friday observed by 12 states  4  Malls  shopping centers and most retail stores close only on Easter  Thanksgiving and Christmas Day  but remain open

holiday is a day off for federal employees  which also means that banks and postal offices are closed  Most private companies and certain other businesses observe federal holidays as well  or the big holidays  If a holiday falls on a Saturday it is celebrated the preceding Friday  if a holiday falls on a Sunday it is celebrated the following Monday  Most  but not all  states and most private businesses also observe a Sunday holiday on the following Monday  There is no generally accepted policy  however  on whether to observe a Saturday holiday on the preceding Friday or the following Monday  Most states and private businesses may observe on the preceding Friday  some may observe it on the following Monday  and some may not observe the holiday at all in those years  In particular  banks that close on Saturdays do not observe a holiday when it falls on Saturday  Date Official Name Remarks January 1 New Year s Day Celebrates beginning of the Gregorian calendar year  Festivities

s Birthday Presidents  Day Washington s Birthday was first declared a federal holiday by an 1879 act of Congress  The Uniform Holidays Act  1968  shifted the date of the commemoration of Washington s Birthday from February 22 to the third Monday in February  between February 15 and 21  meaning the observed holiday never falls on Washington s actual birthday   Because of this  combined with the fact that President Abraham Lincoln s birthday falls on February 12  many people now refer to this holiday as  Presidents  Day  and consider it a day honoring all American presidents  However  neither the Uniform Holidays Act nor any subsequent law changed the name of the holiday from Washington s Birthday to Presidents  Day  8  Last Monday in May Memorial Day Honors the nation s war dead from the
