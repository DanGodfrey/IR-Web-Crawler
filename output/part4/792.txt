created by Elzie Crisler Segar  1  who has appeared in comic strips and animated cartoons in the cinema as well as on television  He first appeared in the daily King Features comic strip Thimble Theatre on January 17  1929  Popeye also became the strip s title in later years  Although Segar s Thimble Theatre strip was in its tenth year when Popeye made his debut in 1929  the sailor quickly became the main focus of the strip and Thimble Theatre became one of King Features  most popular properties during the 1930s  Thimble Theatre was continued after Segar s death in 1938 by several writers and artists  most notably Segar s assistant Bud Sagendorf  The strip  now titled Popeye  continues to appear in first run installments in its Sunday edition  written and drawn by Hy Eisman  The daily strips are reprints of old Sagendorf stories  In 1933  Max and Dave Fleischer s Fleischer Studios adapted the Thimble Theatre characters into a series of Popeye the Sailor theatrical cartoon shorts for Paramount Pictures  These cartoons proved to be among the most popular of the 1930s  and the Fleischers and later Paramount s own Famous Studios continued production through 1957  The cartoons are now owned by Turner Entertainment  a subsidiary of Time Warner  and distributed by sister company Warner Bros  Entertainment  Over the years  Popeye has also appeared in comic books  television cartoons  arcade and video games  hundreds of advertisements and peripheral products  and a 1980 live action film directed by Robert Altman starring comedian Robin Williams as Popeye

While Swee Pea is definitively the ward of Popeye in the comic strips  he is often depicted as belonging to Olive Oyl in cartoons  The cartoons also occasionally feature family members of Popeye that have never appeared in the strip  notably his look alike nephews Peepeye  Pupeye  Pipeye and Poopeye  Even though there is no absolute sense of continuity in the stories  certain plot and presentation elements remain mostly constant  including purposeful contradictions in Popeye s capabilities  Though at times he seems bereft of manners or uneducated  Popeye is often depicted as capable of coming up with solutions to problems that  to the police  or  most importantly  the scientific community  seem insurmountable  Popeye has  alternatively  displayed Sherlock Holmes like investigative prowess  determining for instance that his beloved Olive was abducted by estimating the depth of the villains  footprints in the sand   scientific ingenuity  as his construction  within a few hours  of a  spinach drive  spaceship   or oversimplified  yet successful  diplomatic argumentation  by presenting to diplomatic conferences his own existence     and superhuman strength     as the only true guarantee of world peace   Popeye s vastly versatile exploits are deemed even more amusing by a few standard plot elements  One is the love triangle between Popeye  Olive and Bluto  and the latter s endless machinations to claim Olive at Popeye s expense  Another is his  near saintly  perseverance to overcome any obstacle to please Olive   who  quite often  renounces Popeye for Bluto s dime store advances  She is the only character Popeye will permit to give him a thumping  Finally  in terms of the endless array of villain plots  Popeye mostly comes to the truth by  accidentally  sneaking up on the villains  the moment they are bragging about their schemes  ingenuity  thus revealing everything to an enraged Popeye  who uses his  fisks  in the name of justice   edit  Thimble Theatre and Popeye comic strips Thimble Theatre was created by King Features Syndicate comic writer artist E C  Segar  and was his third published strip  The strip first appeared in the New York Journal  a newspaper operated by King Features owner William Randolph Hearst  on December 19  1919 before later expanding into more papers  In its early years  the strip featured characters acting out various stories and scenarios in theatrical style  hence the strip s name   Thimble Theatre s first main characters actors were the thin Olive Oyl and her boyfriend  Harold Hamgravy  After the strip moved away from its initial focus  it settled into a comedy adventure style featuring Olive  Ham Gravy  and Olive s enterprising brother  Castor Oyl  Olive s parents  Cole and Nana Oyl  also made frequent appearances  Popeye first appeared in the strip on January 17  1929 as a minor character  He was initially hired by Castor Oyl and Ham to crew a ship for a voyage to Dice Island  the location of a casino owned by the crooked gambler Fadewell  Castor intended to break the bank at the casino using the unbeatable good luck conferred by stroking the hairs on the head of Bernice the Whiffle Hen  Weeks later  on the trip back  Popeye was shot many times by Jack Snork  a stooge of Fadewell s  but survived by rubbing Bernice s head  After the adventure  Popeye left the strip  but due to reader reaction  he was quickly brought back  Popeye and J  Wellington Wimpy in E  C  Segar s Thimble Theatre  August 20  1933  The Popeye character became so popular that he was given a larger role  and the strip was expanded into many more newspapers as a result  Though initial strips presented Olive as being less than impressed with Popeye  she eventually left Ham Gravy to become Popeye s girlfriend and Ham Gravy left the strip as a regular  Over the years  however  she has often displayed a fickle attitude towards the sailor  Castor Oyl continued to come up with get rich quick schemes and enlisted Popeye in his misadventures  Eventually he settled down as a detective and later on bought a ranch out West  Castor has seldom appeared in recent years  In 1933  Popeye received a foundling baby in the mail  whom he adopted and named  Swee Pea   Other regular characters in the strip were J  Wellington Wimpy  a hamburger loving moocher who would  gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today   he was also soft spoken and cowardly  Vickers Wellington bombers were nicknamed  Wimpys  after the character   George W  Geezil  a local cobbler who spoke in a heavily affected accent and habitually attempted to murder or wish death upon Wimpy  and Eugene the Jeep  a yellow  vaguely dog like animal from Africa with magical powers  In addition  the strip featured the Sea Hag  a terrible pirate  as well as the last witch on earth  her even more terrible sister excepted   Alice the Goon  a monstrous creature who entered the strip as the Sea Hag s henchman and continued as Swee Pea s babysitter  and Toar  a caveman  Segar s strip was quite different from the cartoons that followed  The stories were more complex  with many characters that never appeared in the cartoons  King Blozo  for example   Spinach usage was rare and Bluto made only one appearance  Segar would sign some of his early Popeye comic strips with a cigar  due to his last name being a homophone of  cigar   pronounced SEE gar   Thimble Theatre soon became one of King Features  most popular strips during the 1930s and  following an eventual name change to Popeye in the 1970s  remains one of the longest running strips in syndication today  The strip carried on after Segar s death in 1938  at which point he was replaced by a series of artists  In the 1950s  a spinoff strip was established  called Popeye the Sailorman  Acknowledging Popeye s growing popularity  the Thimble Theatre strip was renamed Thimble Theatre Starring Popeye during the 1960s and 1970s  and was eventually retitled  simply Popeye  the name under which the strip continues to run   edit  Artists after Segar After Segar s death in 1938  many different artists were hired to draw the strip  Tom Sims  the son of a Coosa River channel boat captain  continued writing Thimble Theatre strips and established the Popeye the Sailorman spin off  Doc Winner and Bela Zaboly  2  successively  handled the artwork during Sims s run  Eventually  Ralph Stein stepped in to write the strip until the series was taken over by Bud Sagendorf in 1959  Sagendorf wrote and drew the daily strip until 1986  and continued to write and draw the Sunday strip until his death in 1994  Sagendorf  who had been Segar s assistant  made a definite effort to retain much of Segar s classic style  although his art is instantly discernible  Sagendorf continued to use many obscure characters from the Segar years  especially O G  Wotasnozzle and King Blozo  Sagendorf s new characters  such as the Thung  also had a very Segar like quality  What set Sagendorf apart from Segar more than anything else was his sense of pacing  Where plotlines moved very quickly with Segar  it would sometimes take an entire week of Sagendorf s daily strips for the plot to be advanced even a small amount  From 1986 to 1992  the daily strip was written and drawn by Bobby London  who  after some controversy  was fired from the strip for a story that could be taken to satirize abortion  3  London s strips put Popeye and his friends in updated situations  but kept the spirit of Segar s original  One classic storyline  titled  The Return of Bluto   showed the sailor battling every version of the bearded bully from the comic strip  comic books  and animated films  The Sunday edition of the comic strip is currently drawn by Hy Eisman  who took over in 1994  The daily strip began featuring reruns of Sagendorf s strips after London was fired and continues to do so today  On January 1  2009  70 years since the death of his creator  Segar s character of Popeye  though not the various films  TV shows  theme music and other media based on him  became public domain 4  in most countries  but remains under copyright in the United States  Because Segar was an employee of King Features Syndicate when he created the Popeye character for the company s Thimble Theatre strip  Popeye is treated as a work for hire under U S  copyright law  Works for hire are protected for 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation  whichever is shorter  Since Popeye made his first appearance in January 1929  and all U S  copyrights expire on December 31 of the year that the term ends  Popeye will not enter the public domain in the U S  until January 1  2025  assuming that no further term extensions are passed into law in the interim   5   edit  Comic books Bud Sagendorf s cover of Popeye  50  Oct  Dec  1959  shows Popeye with his corncob pipe  single good eye and girlfriend Olive Oyl  There have been a number of Popeye comic books  from Dell  King Comics  Gold Key Comics  Charlton Comics and others  originally written and illustrated by Bud Sagendorf  In the Dell comics  Popeye became something like a freelance police assistant  fighting the Mafia and Bluto s criminal activities  The new villains included the Ming dwarves  who were identical  Popeye appeared in the British  TV Comic  series  a News of the World publication  becoming the cover story in 1960 with stories written and drawn by  Chick  Henderson  Bluto was referred to as Brutus and was Popeye s only nemesis throughout the entire run  A variety of artists have created Popeye comic book stories since then  for example  George Wildman drew Popeye stories for Charlton Comics from 1969 until the late 1970s  The Gold Key series was illustrated by Wildman and scripted by Bill Pearson  with some issues written by Nick Cuti  In 1987  Ocean Comics released the Popeye Special written by Ron Portier with art by Ben Dunn  The story presented Popeye s origin story and attempted to tell more of a lighthearted adventure story as opposed to using typical comic strip style humor  The story also featured a more realistic art style and was edited by Bill Pearson  who also lettered and inked the story as well as the front cover  6  A second issue  by the same creative team  followed in 1988  The second issue introduced the idea that Bluto and Brutus were actually twin brothers and not the same person  7  In 1999  to celebrate Popeye s 70th anniversary  Ocean Comics revisited the franchise with a one shot comic book  entitled The Wedding of Popeye and Olive Oyl  written by Peter David  The comic book brought together a large portion of the casts of both the comic strip and the animated shorts  and Popeye and Olive Oyl were finally wed after decades of courtship  However  this marriage has not been reflected in all media since the comic was published  In 1989  a special series of short Popeye comic books were included in specially marked boxes of Instant Quaker Oatmeal  and Popeye also appeared in TV commercials for Quaker Oatmeal  which featured a parrot delivering the tag line  Popeye wants a Quaker   The plots were similar to those of the films  Popeye loses either Olive Oyl or Swee Pea to a muscle bound antagonist  eats something invigorating  and proceeds to save the day  In this case  however  the invigorating elixir was not his usual spinach  but rather one of four flavors of Quaker Oatmeal   A different flavor was showcased with each mini comic   The comics ended with the sailor saying   I m Popeye the Quaker Man    which offended members of the Religious Society of Friends or Quakers  Members of this religious group  which has no connection to the cereal company  are pacifists and do not believe in using violence to resolve conflicts  For Popeye to call himself a  Quaker man  after beating up someone was offensive to the Quakers and considered a misrepresentation of their faith and religious beliefs  After a brief protest  the Quaker Oatmeal Company pulled the comic books and commercials in 1990  and the promotional campaign remains little known  In 2012  writer Roger Langridge and cartoonist Bruce Ozella teamed to revive the spirit of Segar in their four issue comic book miniseries  Popeye  published by IDW   edit  Animated cartoons Main article  Popeye the Sailor  animated cartoons  Popeye and Olive Oyl in Fleischer Studios s A Date to Skate  1938  In November 1932  King Features signed an agreement with Fleischer Studios to have Popeye and the other Thimble Theatre characters begin appearing in a series of animated cartoons  The first cartoon in the series was released in 1933  and Popeye cartoons  released by Paramount Pictures  would remain a staple of Paramount s release schedule for nearly 25 years  Many of the Thimble Theatre characters  including Wimpy  Poopdeck Pappy  and Eugene the Jeep  eventually made appearances in the Paramount cartoons  though appearances by Olive Oyl s extended family and Ham Gravy were notably absent  Thanks to the animated short series  Popeye became even more of a sensation than he had been in comic strips  and by 1938  polls showed that the sailor was Hollywood s most popular cartoon character  8  9  In every Popeye cartoon  the sailor is invariably put into what seems like a hopeless situation  upon which  usually after a beating   a can of spinach which he apparently regularly carries with him falls out from inside his shirt  Popeye immediately pops the can open and gulp the entire contents of it into his mouth  or sometimes sucks in the spinach through his corncob pipe  Upon swallowing the spinach  Popeye s physical strength immediately becomes almost superhuman  and he is easily able to save the day  and very often rescue Olive Oyl from a dire situation   In May 1941  Paramount Pictures assumed ownership of Fleischer Studios  fired the Fleischers and began reorganizing the studio  which they renamed Famous Studios  The early Famous era shorts were often World War II themed  featuring Popeye fighting Nazis and Japanese soldiers  most notably the 1942 short You re a Sap  Mr  Jap  In late 1943  the Popeye series was moved to Technicolor production  beginning with Her Honor the Mare  Famous Paramount continued producing the Popeye series until 1957  with Spooky Swabs being the last of the 125 Famous shorts in the series  Paramount then sold the Popeye film catalog to Associated Artists Productions  which was bought out by United Artists in 1958 and later merged with Metro Goldwyn Mayer  which was itself purchased by Turner Entertainment in 1986  Turner sold off the production end of MGM UA shortly after  but retained the film catalog  giving it the rights to the theatrical Popeye library  The black and white Popeye shorts were shipped to South Korea in 1985  where artists retraced them into color  The retraced shorts were syndicated in 1987 on a barter basis  and remained available until the early 1990s  Turner merged with Time Warner in 1996  and Warner Bros   through its Turner subsidiary  therefore currently controls the rights to the Popeye shorts  In 2001  the Cartoon Network  under the supervision of animation historian Jerry Beck  created a new incarnation of The Popeye Show  The show aired the Fleischer and Famous Studios Popeye shorts in versions approximating their original theatrical releases by editing copies of the original opening and closing credits  taken or recreated from various sources  onto the beginnings and ends of each cartoon  or in some cases  in their complete  uncut original theatrical versions direct from such prints that originally contained the front and end Paramount credits  The series aired 135 Popeye shorts over forty five episodes  until March 2004  The Popeye Show continued to air on Cartoon Network s spin off network Boomerang  While many of the Paramount Popeye cartoons remained unavailable on video  a handful of those cartoons had fallen into public domain and were found on numerous low budget VHS tapes and later DVDs  When Turner Entertainment acquired the cartoons in 1986  a long and laborious legal struggle with King Features kept the majority of the original Popeye shorts from official video releases for more than 20 years  King Features instead opted to release a DVD boxed set of the 1960s made for television Popeye the Sailor cartoons  which it retained the rights to  in 2004  In the meantime  home video rights to the Associated Artists Productions library were transferred from CBS Fox Video to MGM UA Home Video in 1986  and eventually to Warner Home Video in 1999  In 2006  Warner Home Video announced it would release all of the Popeye cartoons produced for theatrical release between 1933 and 1957 on DVD  restored and uncut  The first of Warner s Popeye DVD sets  covering the cartoons released from 1933 until early 1938  was released on July 31  2007  1  In 1960  King Features Syndicate commissioned a new series of cartoons entitled Popeye the Sailor  but this time for television syndication  The artwork was streamlined and simplified for the television budgets  and 220 cartoons were produced in only two years  with the first set of them premiering in the autumn of 1960  and the last of them debuting during the 1961 1962 television season  For these cartoons  Bluto s name was changed to  Brutus   as King Features believed at the time that Paramount owned the rights to the name  Bluto   On September 9  1978  an hour long animated series produced by Hanna Barbera Productions  The All New Popeye Hour  debuted on the CBS Saturday morning lineup  It ran until September 1981  when it was cut to a half hour and retitled The Popeye and Olive Show  It was removed from the CBS lineup in September 1983  Popeye briefly returned to CBS in 1987 for Popeye and Son  another Hanna Barbera series  which lasted for one season  In 2004  Lions Gate Entertainment produced a computer animated television special  Popeye s Voyage  The Quest for Pappy  which was made to coincide with the 75th anniversary of Popeye  Billy West performed the voice of Popeye  after the first day of recording  his throat was so sore he had to return to his hotel room and drink honey  The uncut version was released on DVD on November 9  2004  and was aired in a re edited version on Fox on December 17  2004 and again on December 30  2005  Its style was influenced by the 1930s Fleischer cartoons  and featured Swee Pea  Wimpy  Bluto  who is Popeye s friend in this version   Olive Oyl  Poopdeck Pappy and the Sea Hag as its characters  On November 6  2007  Lionsgate Entertainment re released Popeye s Voyage on DVD with redesigned cover art   edit  Theme song Popeye s theme song  titled  I m Popeye The Sailor Man   composed by Sammy Lerner in 1933 for Fleischer s first Popeye the Sailor cartoon  10  has become forever associated with the sailor  As one cartoon historian has observed  Popeye s theme song itself was inspired by two lines of the tune  Oh  Better Far to Live and Die   sung by the Pirate King and chorus in Act I of Gilbert and Sullivan s operetta The Pirates of Penzance   For I am a Pirate King   You are  Hoorah for the Pirate King    citation needed  The tune behind those two lines is similar to the  Popeye  song  except for the high note on the first  King   The Sailor s Hornpipe has often been used as an introduction to Popeye s theme song  A cover of the theme song  performed by Face To Face  is included on the 1995 tribute album Saturday Morning  Cartoons  Greatest Hits  produced by Ralph Sall for MCA Records   edit  Other media The success of Popeye as a comic strip and animated character has led to appearances in many other forms  For more than 20 years  Stephen DeStefano has been the artist drawing Popeye for King Features licensing  11   edit  Radio Popeye was adapted to radio in several series broadcast over three different networks by two sponsors from 1935 to 1938  Popeye and most of the major supporting characters were first featured in a thrice weekly 15 minute radio program  Popeye the Sailor  which starred Detmar Poppen as Popeye along with most of the major supporting characters Olive Oyl  Olive Lamoy   Wimpy  Charles Lawrence   Bluto  Jackson Beck  and Swee Pea  Mae Questel   In the first episode  Popeye adopted Sonny

Network  87 episodes   initially sponsored by Wheatena  a whole wheat breakfast cereal  which would routinely replace the spinach references  Music was provided by Victor Irwin s Cartoonland Band  Announcer Kelvin Keech sang  to composer Lerner s  Popeye  theme   Wheatena is his diet   He asks you to try it   With Popeye the sailor man   Wheatena paid King Features Syndicate  1 200 per week  The show was next broadcast Mondays  Wednesdays and Fridays from 7 15 to 7 30pm on WABC and ran from August 31  1936 to February 26  1937  78 episodes   Floyd Buckley played Popeye  and Miriam Wolfe

Popeye  his first movie role   Paul Smith as Bluto and Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl  with songs by Harry Nilsson  The script was by Jules Feiffer  who adapted the 1971 Nostalgia Press book of 1936 strips for his screenplay  thus retaining many of the characters created by Segar  A co production of Paramount Pictures and Walt Disney Productions  the movie was filmed almost entirely on Malta  in the village of Mellie a on the northwest coast of the island  The set is now a tourist attraction called Popeye Village  The US box office earnings were double the film s budget  making it somewhat of a success  Upcoming film In March 2010  it was reported that Sony Pictures Animation is developing 3 D computer animated Popeye film  with Avi Arad producing it  14  In November 2011  Sony Pictures Animation announced that Jay Scherick and David Ronn  the writers of The Smurfs  are writing the screenplay for the film  15   edit  Video and pinball games Nintendo created a widescreen Game  amp  Watch called Popeye in 1981  The handheld game featured Popeye on a boat  and the aim was to catch bottles  pineapples  and spinach cans thrown by Olive Oyl while trying to avoid Bluto s boat  If Bluto hit Popeye on the head with his mallet or Popeye failed to catch an object three times  the game would end  The Nintendo arcade game Donkey Kong was originally conceived as a Popeye video game by Shigeru Miyamoto  But due to licensing disagreements with King Features  this idea was scrapped  16  When Donkey Kong went on to enormous success  King Features agreed to license the characters to Nintendo to create a Popeye arcade game in 1982  It was later ported to the Commodore 64 home computer as well as various home game consoles  Intellivision  Atari 2600  ColecoVision  Famicom NES  and Odyssey2  The goal was to avoid Bluto  referred to as  Brutus   and the Sea Hag while collecting hearts  musical notes  or the letters in the word  help   depending on the level   Hitting a can of spinach gave Popeye a brief chance to strike back at Brutus  Other characters such as Wimpy and Swee  Pea appeared in the game but did not greatly affect gameplay  The game is playable on the MAME game emulator computer program for PC  A board game based on the video game was released by Parker Brothers  A table top Game  amp  Watch style game was also released by Nintendo in 1983  which featured Popeye trying to rescue Olive while engaging in fisticuffs with Bluto  Nintendo created another Popeye game for the Famicom  Popeye no Eigo Asobi  in 1983  This was an educational game

character  Popeye  Doyle from the 1971 film The French Connection  who was in turn named after real police detective Eddie Egan  who was called  Pop Eye  because of his keen observational skills  The restaurant chain would later obtain a license for use of the cartoon character and advertise the name as Popeye s after Popeye the sailor  causing some confusion as to the source of the name  Popeyes

Wimpys  appeared in a television commercial for Minute Maid Orange Juice  The commercial  produced by Leo Burnett Co  showed Popeye and Bluto as friends  and neglecting Olive Oyl  due to their having had Minute Maid Orange Juice that morning  The ad agency s intention was to show that even the notable enemies would be in a good mood after their juice  but some  including Robert Knight of the Culture and Family Institute  felt the commercial s intent was to portray the pair in a homosexual romantic relationship an allegation that Minute Maid denies  Knight was interviewed by Stephen Colbert on Comedy Central s The Daily Show about this issue  World Candies Inc  produced Popeye branded  candy cigarettes   which were small sugar sticks with red dye at the end to simulate a flame

cleans up his garbage  however  when some more plastic garbage sails by Popeye s boat  he says unsurprisingly   I can t do it all meself  you know   In 1995  the Popeye comic strip was one of 20 included in the Comic Strip Classics series of commemorative U S  postage stamps  From 1996 to 1999  the Darien Lake theme park in Western New York operated a  Popeye s Seaport  in the park  It was rebranded as  Looney Tunes Seaport  after Darien Lake came under the Six Flags banner  In 2006  King Features Syndicate produced a radio spot and an industrial for the United States Power Squadrons featuring Robyn Gryphe as Olive and Allen Enlow as Popeye  Sports Starting in 1940  Popeye became the mascot of the Flamengo  Rio de Janeiro   Brazil   the most popular soccer team with almost 50 million fans around the world  The mascot of the soccer club is currently a cartoon vulture  21   edit  Cultural origins and impact Popeye on a Spanish Republican Air Force Polikarpov I 16  Museo del Aire Local folklore in Chester  Illinois  Segar s hometown  claims that Popeye is based on Frank  Rocky  Fiegel  a man who was handy with his fists  22  Fiegel was born on January 27  1868  He lived as a bachelor his entire life  It was said that later Segar sent checks to Fiegel in the 1930s  Fiegel died on March 24  1947 at the age of 79  citation needed  Culturally  23  many consider Popeye a precursor to the superheroes who would eventually come to dominate the world of comic books  24  Some observers of popular culture point out that the fundamental character of Popeye  paralleling that of another 1930s icon  Superman  is very close to the traditional view of how the U S  sees itself as a nation  possessing uncompromising moral standards and resorting to force when threatened  or when he  can t stands no more  bad behavior from an antagonist  citation needed  This theory is directly reinforced in certain cartoons  when Popeye defeats his foe while a US patriotic song  usually either  Stars and Stripes Forever    Yankee Doodle   or  Columbia  Gem of the Ocean   plays on the soundtrack  One of Popeye s catchphrases is  I yam what I yam  and that s all what I yam   which may be seen as an expression of individualism  Such has been Popeye s cultural impact that the medical profession sometimes refers to the biceps bulge symptomatic of a tendon rupture as the  Popeye muscle   25  26  Note  however  that under normal  non spinach influenced  conditions  Popeye has pronounced muscles of the forearm  not of the biceps  At the end of his song  Kansas City Star   Roger Miller s character of a local TV kids show announcer says   Stay tuned  we ll have a Popeye cartoon in just a minute   The 1988 Disney film Who Framed Roger Rabbit featured many classic cartoon characters  and the absence of Popeye was noted by some critics  Popeye  along with Bluto and Olive Oyl  actually had a role planned for the film  However since the Popeye cartoons were based on a comic book series  Disney found they had to pay licensing fees to both King Features Syndicate and MGM UA  MGM UA s pre 1986 library  which included Popeye  was being purchased by Turner Entertainment at the time  which created legal complications  thus  the rights could not be obtained and Popeye s cameo was dropped from the film  27  Most prominently  Popeye has been associated with the vegetable spinach  and is credited by many who   with popularizing the vegetable among children  In 1973  Cary Bates created Captain Strong  a takeoff of Popeye  for DC Comics  28  as a way of having two cultural icons   Superman and  a proxy of  Popeye   meet  29   edit  Spinach The popularity of Popeye helped boost spinach sales  Consumption of the leafy vegetable increased 33 percent in the United States between 1931 and 1936 as Popeye gained popularity  citation needed  Using Popeye as a role model for healthier eating may work  a 2010 study revealed that children increased their vegetable consumption after watching Popeye cartoons  30  The spinach growing community of Crystal City  Texas  erected a statue of the character in recognition of Popeye s positive effects on the spinach industry  There is another Popeye statue in Segar s hometown  Chester  Illinois  and statues in Springdale  Arkansas and Alma  Arkansas  which claims to be  The Spinach Capital of the World    at canning plants of Allen Canning  which markets Popeye branded canned spinach  In addition to Allen Canning s Popeye spinach  Popeye Fresh Foods markets bagged  fresh spinach with Popeye characters on the package  In 2006  when spinach contaminated with E  coli was accidentally sold to the public  many editorial cartoonists lampooned the affair by featuring Popeye in their cartoons  31  A frequently circulated story claims that Fleischer s choice of spinach to give Popeye strength was based on faulty calculations of its iron content  In the story  a scientist misplaced a decimal point in an 1870 measurement of spinach s iron content  leading to an iron value ten times higher than it should have been  This faulty measurement was not noticed until the 1930s  32  33  34  While this story has gone through longstanding circulation  recent study has shown that this is a myth  and it was chosen for its vitamin A content alone  see Spinach  Popeye and iron   edit  Word coinages The strip is also responsible for popularizing  although not inventing  the word  goon   meaning a thug or lackey   goons in Popeye s world were large humanoids with indistinctly drawn faces that were particularly known for being used as muscle and slave labor by Popeye s nemesis  the Sea Hag  One particular goon  the aforementioned female named Alice  was an occasional recurring character in the animated shorts  but she was usually a fairly nice character  Eugene the Jeep was introduced in the comic strip on March 13  1936  Two years later the term  jeep wagons  was in use  later shortened to simply  jeep  with widespread WWII usage and then trademarked by Willys Overland as  Jeep   35  Some dispute this claim  however  as the WWII jeep was designated a  general purpose vehicle   with  GP  or  GPV  aka  jeep  appearing on the paperwork   edit  Events and honors The Popeye Picnic is held every year in Chester  Illinois on the weekend after Labor Day  Popeye fans attend from across the globe  including a visit by a film crew from South Korea in 2004  The one eyed sailor s hometown strives to entertain devotees of all ages  36  In honor of Popeye s 75th anniversary  the Empire State Building illuminated its notable tower lights green the weekend of January 16 18  2004 as a tribute to the icon s love of spinach  This special lighting marked the only time the Empire State Building ever celebrated the anniversary birthday of a comic strip character  37   edit  Reprints Popeye the Sailor  Nostalgia Press  1971  reprints three daily stories from 1936  Thimble Theatre  Hyperion
