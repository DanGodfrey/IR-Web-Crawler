parties Federalism State government Governors Legislatures  List  State courts Local government Other countries   Atlas Politics portal v t e The United States is a federal constitutional republic  in which the President of the United States  the head of state and head of government   Congress  and judiciary share powers reserved to the national government  and the federal government shares sovereignty with the state governments  The executive branch is headed by the President and is independent of the legislature  Legislative power is vested in the two chambers of Congress  the Senate and the House of Representatives  The judicial branch  or judiciary   composed of the Supreme Court and lower federal courts  exercises judicial power  or judiciary   The judiciary s function is to interpret the United States Constitution and federal laws and regulations  This includes resolving disputes between the executive and legislative branches  The federal government s layout is explained in the Constitution  Two political parties  the Democratic Party and the Republican Party  have dominated American politics since the American Civil War  although other parties have also existed  There are major differences between the political system of the United States and that of most other developed democracies  These include greater power in the upper house of the legislature  a wider scope of power held by the Supreme Court  the separation of powers between the legislature and the executive  and the dominance of only two main parties  Third parties have less political influence in the United States than in other developed country democracies  The federal entity created by the U S  Constitution is the dominant feature of the American governmental system  However  most people are also subject to a state government  and all are subject to various units of local government  The latter include counties  municipalities  and special districts  This multiplicity of jurisdictions reflects the country s history  The federal government was created by the states  which as colonies were established separately and governed themselves independently of the others  Units of local government were created by the colonies to efficiently carry out various state functions  As the country expanded  it admitted new states modeled on the existing ones  Contents 1 Political culture 1 1

of the United States and Thirteen Colonies The American political culture is deeply rooted in the colonial experience and the American Revolution  The colonies were exceptional in the European world for their vibrant political culture  which attracted the most talented and ambitious young men into politics  1  First  suffrage was the most widespread in the world  with every man who owned a certain amount of property allowed to vote  While fewer than 1  of British men could vote  a majority of white American men were eligible  While the roots of democracy were apparent  nevertheless deference was typically shown to social elites in colonial elections  2  That deference declined sharply with the American Revolution  Second  in each colony a wide range of public and private business was decided by elected bodies  especially the assemblies and county governments  3  Topic of public concern and debate included land grants  commercial subsidies  and taxation  as well as oversight of roads  poor relief  taverns  and schools  Americans spent a great deal of time in court  as private lawsuits were very common  Legal affairs were overseen by local judges and juries  with a central role for trained lawyers  This promoted the rapid expansion of the legal profession  and dominant role of lawyers in politics was apparent by the 1770s  as attested by the careers of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson  among many others  4  Thirdly  the American colonies were exceptional in world context because of the growth of representation of different interest groups  Unlike Europe  where the royal court  aristocratic families and the established church were in control  the American political culture was open to merchants  landlords  petty farmers  artisans  Anglicans  Presbyterians  Quakers  Germans  Scotch Irish  Yankees  Yorkers  and many other identifiable groups  Over 90  of the representatives elected to the legislature lived in their districts  unlike England where it was common to have a member of Parliament and absentee member of Parliament  Finally  and most dramatically  the Americans were fascinated by and increasingly adopted the political values of Republicanism  which stressed equal rights  the need for virtuous citizens  and the evils of corruption  luxury  and aristocracy  5  None of the colonies had political parties of the sort that formed in the 1790s  but each had shifting factions that vied for power   edit  American ideology Republicanism  along with a form of classical liberalism remains the dominant ideology  Central documents include the Declaration of Independence  1776   the Constitution  1787   the Federalist Papers  1788   the Bill of Rights  1791   and Lincoln s  Gettysburg Address   1863   among others  Among the core tenets of this ideology are the following  Civic duty  citizens have the responsibility to understand and support the government  participate in elections  pay taxes  and perform military service  Opposition to Political corruption  Democracy  The government is answerable to citizens  who may change the representatives through elections  Equality before the law  The laws should attach no special privilege to any citizen  Government officials are subject to the law just as others are  Freedom of religion  The government can neither support nor suppress religion  Freedom of speech  The government cannot restrict through law or action the personal  non violent speech of a citizen  a marketplace of ideas  At the time of the United States  founding  the economy was predominantly one of agriculture and small private businesses  and state governments left welfare issues to private or local initiative  As in the UK and other industrialized countries  laissez faire ideology was largely discredited during the Great Depression  Between the 1930s and 1970s  fiscal policy was characterized by the Keynesian consensus  a time during which modern American liberalism dominated economic policy virtually unchallenged  6  7  Since the late 1970s and early 1980s  however  laissez faire ideology has once more become a powerful force in American politics  8  While the American welfare state expanded more than threefold after WWII  it has been at 20  of GDP since the late 1970s  9  10  Today  modern American liberalism  and modern American conservatism are engaged in a continuous political battle  characterized by what the Economist describes as  greater divisiveness  and  close  but bitterly fought elections   11  Before World War II  the United States largely pursued a noninterventionist policy in foreign affairs by not taking sides in conflicts between foreign powers  The country abandoned this policy when it became a superpower  and the country mostly supports internationalism  citation needed   edit  Suffrage Main article  Voting rights in the United States Suffrage is nearly universal for citizens 18 years of age and older  All states and the District of Columbia contribute to the electoral vote for President  However  the District  and other U S  holdings like Puerto Rico and Guam  lack representation in Congress  These constituencies do not have the right to choose any political figure outside their respective areas  Each commonwealth  territory  or district can only elect a non voting delegate to serve in the House of Representatives  Woman s Suffrage Women s suffrage became an important issue after the American Civil War  The reason it rose to the forefront is because after the war African American men were granted the right to vote  After that  women wanted to have the right to vote as well  Two major interest groups were formed  The first group was the National Woman Suffrage Association  formed by Susan B  Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton  The main purpose of this group of women was to work for suffrage on the federal level and to push for more governmental changes  such as the granting of property rights to married women  12  The second group that was formed was the American Woman Suffrage Association  formed by Lucy Stone  The main goal of this group was to give women the right to vote  13  All of these women had one goal  they wanted to see improvements for the woman s economic and social status  14  But being two separate groups would not help their goal to give women the right to vote  In 1880  the two groups joined together to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association  NAWSA   14  Now that the two groups had formed together  they had one goal  to give women the right to vote  The NAWSA traveled state to state giving speeches and talking to legislatures  In the early 1900 s Alice Paul  founder of the Congressional Union  put a stop to the state to state approach  She then gave them the option to try to pass an amendment in the U S  Constitution  14  In 1920  the 19th amendment to the U S  Constitution was passed  saying that the right to vote could not be denied because of gender  Voting rights are sometimes restricted as a result of felony conviction  but such laws vary widely by state  Election of the president is an indirect suffrage  voters vote for electors  who  in turn vote for President  In theory  these electors vote as they please  but in modern practice  they usually do not vote against the wishes of their constituencies  though they have abstained from voting in protest    edit  State government See also  State governments of the United States States governments have the power to make laws for all citizens that are not granted to the federal government or denied to the states in the U S  Constitution These include education  family law  contract law  and most crimes  Unlike the federal government  which only has those powers granted to it in the Constitution  a state government has inherent powers allowing it to act unless limited by a provision of the state or national constitution  Like the federal government  state governments have three branches  executive  legislative  and judicial  The chief executive of a state is its popularly elected governor  who typically holds office for a four year term  although in some states the term is two years   Except for Nebraska  which has unicameral legislature  all states have a bicameral legislature  with the upper house usually called the Senate and the lower house called the House of Representatives  the House of Delegates  Assembly or something similar  In most states  senators serve four year terms  and members of the lower house serve two year terms  The constitutions of the various states differ in some details but generally follow a pattern similar to that of the federal Constitution  including a statement of the rights of the people and a plan for organizing the government  However  state constitutions are generally more detailed   edit  Local government See also  Urban politics in the United States There are 89 500 local governments  including 3 033 counties  19 492 municipalities  16 500 townships  13 000 school districts  and 37 000 other special districts that deal with issues like fire protection  15  Local governments directly serve the needs of the people  providing everything from police and fire protection to sanitary codes  health regulations  education  public transportation  and housing  Typically local elections are nonpartisan  local activists suspend their party affiliations when campaigning and governing  16  About 28  of the people live in cities of 100 000 or more population  City governments are chartered by states  and their charters detail the objectives and powers of the municipal government  For most big cities  cooperation with both state and federal organizations is essential to meeting the needs of their residents  Types of city governments vary widely across the nation  However  almost all have a central council  elected by the voters  and an executive officer  assisted by various department heads  to manage the city s affairs  Cities in the West and South usually have nonpartisan local politics  There are three general types of city government  the mayor council  the commission  and the council manager  These are the pure forms  many cities have developed a combination of two or three of them   edit  Mayor Council This is the oldest form of city government in the United States and  until the beginning of the 20th century  was used by nearly all American cities  Its structure is like that of the state and national governments  with an elected mayor as chief of the executive branch and an elected council that represents the various neighborhoods forming the legislative branch  The mayor appoints heads of city departments and other officials  sometimes with the approval of the council  He or she has the power of veto over ordinances  the laws of the city  and often is responsible for preparing the city s budget  The council passes city ordinances  sets the tax rate on property  and apportions money among the various city departments  As cities have grown  council seats have usually come to represent more than a single neighborhood   edit  The Commission This combines both the legislative and executive functions in one group of officials  usually three or more in number  elected city wide  Each commissioner supervises the work of one or more city departments  Commissioners also set policies and rules by which the city is operated  One is named chairperson of the body and is often called the mayor  although his or her power is equivalent to that of the other commissioners  17   edit  Council Manager The city manager is a response to the increasing complexity of urban problems that need management ability not often possessed by elected public officials  The answer has been to entrust most of the executive powers  including law enforcement and provision of services  to a highly trained and experienced professional city manager  The city manager plan has been adopted by a large number of cities  Under this plan  a small  elected council makes the city ordinances and sets policy  but hires a paid administrator  also called a city manager  to carry out its decisions  The manager draws up the city budget and supervises most of the departments  Usually  there is no set term  the manager serves as long as the council is satisfied with his or her work   edit  County government The county is a subdivision of the state  sometimes  but not always  containing two or more townships and several villages  New York City is so large that it is divided into five separate boroughs  each a county in its own right  On the other hand  Arlington County  Virginia  the United States  smallest county  located just across the Potomac River from Washington  D C   is both an urbanized and suburban area  governed by a unitary county administration  In other cities  both the city and county governments have merged  creating a consolidated city county government  In most U S  counties  one town or city is designated as the county seat  and this is where the government offices are located and where the board of commissioners or supervisors meets  In small counties  boards are chosen by the county  in the larger ones  supervisors represent separate districts or townships  The board collects taxes for state and local governments  borrows and appropriates money  fixes the salaries of county employees  supervises elections  builds and maintains highways and bridges  and administers national  state  and county welfare programs  In very small counties  the executive and legislative power may lie entirely with a sole commissioner  who is assisted by boards to supervise taxes and elections  In some New England states  counties do not have any governmental function and are simply a division of land   edit  Town and village government Thousands of municipal jurisdictions are too small to qualify as city governments  These are chartered as towns and villages and deal with local needs such as paving and lighting the streets  ensuring a water supply  providing police and fire protection  and waste management  In many states of the US  the term town does not have any specific meaning  it is simply an informal term applied to populated places  both incorporated and unincorporated municipalities   Moreover  in some states  the term town is equivalent to how civil townships are used in other states  The government is usually entrusted to an elected board or council  which may be known by a variety of names  town or village council  board of selectmen  board of supervisors  board of commissioners  The board may have a chairperson or president who functions as chief executive officer  or there may be an elected mayor  Governmental employees may include a clerk  treasurer  police and fire officers  and health and welfare officers  One unique aspect of local government  found mostly in the New England region of the United States  is the town meeting  Once a year  sometimes more often if needed  the registered voters of the town meet in open session to elect officers  debate local issues  and pass laws for operating the government  As a body  they decide on road construction and repair  construction of public buildings and facilities  tax rates  and the town budget  The town meeting  which has existed for more than three centuries in some places  is often cited as the purest form of direct democracy  in which the governmental power is not delegated  but is exercised directly and regularly by all the people   edit  Campaign finance Main article  Campaign finance in the United States Successful participation  especially in federal elections  requires large amounts of money  especially for television advertising  18  This money is very difficult to raise by appeals to a mass base  19  although in the 2008 election  candidates from both parties had success with raising money from citizens over the Internet  20  as had Howard Dean with his Internet appeals  Both parties generally depend on wealthy donors and organizations   traditionally the Democrats depended on donations from organized labor while the Republicans relied on business donations citation needed   This dependency on donors is controversial  and has led to laws limiting spending on political campaigns being enacted  see campaign finance reform   Opponents of campaign finance laws cite the First Amendment s guarantee of free speech  and challenge campaign finance laws because they attempt to circumvent the people s constitutionally guaranteed rights  Even when laws are upheld  the complication of compliance with the First Amendment requires careful and cautious drafting of legislation  leading to laws that are still fairly limited in scope  especially in comparison to those of other countries such as the United Kingdom  France or Canada  Fundraising plays a large role in getting a candidate elected to public office  Without large sums money  a candidate has no chance of achieving his goal  In 2004 general elections  95  of House races and 91  of senate races were won by candidates who spent the most on his campaign   howstuffworks com  Attempts to limit the influence of money on American political campaigns dates back to the 1860s  Recent  Congress passed legislation requiring candidates to disclose  Sources of campaign contributions and how the money is spent and regulated use of  soft money  contributions   brookings edu  21  The best and most comprehensive reform is voluntary public financing of all federal elections where candidates have strong incentives to replace private money with public funding  http   www cleanupwashington org cfr  Elections represent the will of the people rather than the influence of moneyed interests   publiccitizen com  22  The 2012 presidential campaign was slow to develop in both candidates and fundraising  EX  By the end of September  the financial positions of Republican contenders in the cycle were worse than those of Democrats at the same point in the 2004 campaign   opensecrets org  EXAMPLE  Candidates running for office in Georgia come under one of two sets of laws  federal and state  that govern the raising and spending of campaign finance laws have been frequent targets of reform efforts   edit  Political parties and elections The United States Constitution has never formally addressed the issue of political parties  primarily because the Founding Fathers did not originally intend for American politics to be partisan  In Federalist Papers No  9 and No  10  Alexander Hamilton and James Madison  respectively  wrote specifically about the dangers of domestic political factions  In addition  the first President of the United States  George Washington  was not a member of any political party at the time of his election or throughout his tenure as president  Furthermore  he hoped that political parties would not be formed  fearing conflict and stagnation  23  Nevertheless  the beginnings of the American two party system emerged from his immediate circle of advisers  including Hamilton and Madison  In partisan elections  candidates are nominated by a political party or seek public office as an independent  Each state has significant discretion in deciding how candidates are nominated  and thus eligible to appear on the election ballot  Typically  major party candidates are formally chosen in a party primary or convention  whereas minor party and Independents are required to complete a petitioning process   edit  Political parties Main article  Political parties in the United States The modern political party system in the United States is a two party system dominated by the Democratic Party and the Republican Party  These two parties have won every United States presidential election since 1852 and have controlled the United States Congress since at least 1856  Several other third parties from time to time achieve relatively minor representation at the national and state levels  Among the two major parties  the Democratic Party generally positions itself as left of center in American politics and supports an American liberalism platform  while the Republican Party generally positions itself as right of center and supports an American conservatism platform  Political Animals When most people talk about politics  some think of the animals that have been used to represent each of the parties  The two animals that are used are the donkey and the elephant  the elephant representing the Republican Party and the donkey representing the Democratic Party  A very popular cartoonist  in the early years of U S  political satire  was Thomas Nast  A German immigrant who grew up in New York State  Nast to use humor to show what was going on in politics  He is well known for many cartoons regarding specific parts of politics that sparked his interest  but he introduced the two animals  Many political figures liked the idea of having an animal represent them  The Democratic Party said they liked the donkey because it represented their party as brave and intelligent  The Republican Party said they liked the elephant because it showed strength and dignity  The elephant cartoon was named   The Off Year   presented in November 17  1877 in the Harper s Weekly  He decided to use it because he was a strong Republican and wanted to use a strong and powerful animal to support his political views  The donkey cartoon   A Live Jackass Kicking a Dead Lion   shown in Harper s Weekly  in January 15  1870  The donkey had been used during Andrew Jackson s campaign  Thomas Nast didn t create the idea to use the donkey  he just used his artistic skills to amplify the idea   edit  Elections For more details on this topic  see Elections in the United States  Unlike the United Kingdom and other similar parliamentary systems  Americans vote for a specific candidate instead of directly selecting a particular political party  With a federal government  officials are elected at the federal  national   state and local levels  On a national level  the President  is elected indirectly by the people  through an Electoral College  In modern times  the electors virtually always vote with the popular vote of their state  All members of Congress  and the offices at the state and local levels are directly elected  Both federal and state laws regulate elections  The United States Constitution defines  to a basic extent  how federal elections are held  in Article One and Article Two and various amendments  State law regulates most aspects of electoral law  including primaries  the eligibility of voters  beyond the basic constitutional definition   the running of each state s electoral college  and the running of state and local elections   edit  Organization of American political parties See also  Political party strength in U S  states American political parties are more loosely organized than those in other countries  The two major parties  in particular  have no formal organization at the national level that controls membership  activities  or policy positions  though some state affiliates do  Thus  for an American to say that he or she is a member of the Democratic or Republican party  is quite different from a Briton s stating that he or she is a member of the Conservative or Labour party  In the United States  one can often become a  member  of a party  merely by stating that fact  In some U S  states  a voter can register as a member of one or another party and or vote in the primary election for one or another party  Such participation does not restrict one s choices in any way  It also does not give a person any particular rights or obligations within the party  other than possibly allowing that person to vote in that party s primary elections  A person may choose to attend meetings of one local party committee one day and another party committee the next day  The sole factor that brings one  closer to the action  is the quantity and quality of participation in party activities and the ability to persuade others in attendance to give one responsibility  Party identification becomes somewhat formalized when a person runs for partisan office  In most states  this means declaring oneself a candidate for the nomination of a particular party and intent to enter that party s primary election for an office  A party committee may choose to endorse one or another of those who is seeking the nomination  but in the end the choice is up to those who choose to vote in the primary  and it is often difficult to tell who is going to do the voting  The result is that American political parties have weak central organizations and little central ideology  except by consensus  A party really cannot prevent a person who disagrees with the majority of positions of the party or actively works against the party s aims from claiming party membership  so long as the voters who choose to vote in the primary elections elect that person  Once in office  an elected official may change parties simply by declaring such intent  At the federal level  each of the two major parties has a national committee  See  Democratic National Committee  Republican National Committee  that acts as the hub for much fund raising and campaign activities  particularly in presidential campaigns  The exact composition of these committees is different for each party  but they are made up primarily of representatives from state parties and affiliated organizations  and others important to the party  However  the national committees do not have the power to direct the activities of members of the party  Both parties also have separate campaign committees which work to elect candidates at a specific level  The most significant of these are the Hill committees  which work to elect candidates to each house of Congress  State parties exist in all fifty states  though their structures differ according to state law  as well as party rules at both the national and the state level  Despite these weak organizations  elections are still usually portrayed as national races between the political parties  In what is known as  presidential coattails   candidates in presidential elections become the de facto leader of their respective party  and thus usually bring out supporters who in turn then vote for his party s candidates for other offices  On the other hand  federal midterm elections  where only Congress and not the president is up for election  are usually regarded as a referendum on the sitting president s performance  with voters either voting in or out the president s party s candidates  which in turn helps the next session of Congress to either pass or block the president s agenda  respectively  24  25   edit  General developments See also  History of the United States Republican Party and History of the United States Democratic Party Many of America s Founding Fathers hated the thought of political parties  26  They were sure quarreling factions would be more interested in contending with each other than in working for the common good  They wanted citizens to vote for candidates without the interference of organized groups  but this was not to be  By the 1790s  different views of the new country s proper course had already developed  and those who held these opposing views tried to win support for their cause by banding together  The followers of Alexander Hamilton  the Hamiltonian faction  took up the name  Federalist   they favored a strong central government that would support the interests of commerce and industry  The followers of Thomas Jefferson  the Jeffersonians and then the  Anti Federalists   took up the name  Democratic Republicans   they preferred a decentralized agrarian republic in which the federal government had limited power  By 1828  the Federalists had disappeared as an organization  replaced by the Whigs  brought to life in opposition to the election that year of President Andrew Jackson  Jackson s presidency split the Democratic Republican Party  Jacksonians became the Democratic Party and those following the leadership of John Quincy Adams became the  National Republicans   The two party system  still in existence today  was born   Note  The National Republicans of John Quincy Adams is not the same party as today s Republican Party   In the 1850s  the issue of slavery took center stage  with disagreement in particular over the question of whether slavery should be permitted in the country s new territories in the West  The Whig Party straddled the issue and sank to its death after the overwhelming electoral defeat by Franklin Pierce in the 1852 presidential election  Ex Whigs joined the Know Nothings or the newly formed Republican Party  While the Know Nothing party was short lived  Republicans would survive the intense politics leading up to the Civil War  The primary Republican policy was that slavery be excluded from all the territories  Just six years later  this new party captured the presidency when Abraham Lincoln won the election of 1860  By then  parties were well established as the country s dominant political organizations  and party allegiance had become an important part of most people s consciousness  Party loyalty was passed from fathers to sons  and party activities  including spectacular campaign events  complete with uniformed marching groups and torchlight parades  were a part of the social life of many communities  By the 1920s  however  this boisterous folksiness had diminished  Municipal reforms  civil service reform  corrupt practices acts  and presidential primaries to replace the power of politicians at national conventions had all helped to clean up politics   edit  Development of the two party system in the United

2008  See also  Causes of a two party system Since the 1790s  the country has been run by two major parties  Many minor or third political parties appear from time to time  They tend to serve a means to advocate policies that eventually are adopted by the two major political parties  At various times the Socialist Party  the Farmer Labor Party and the Populist Party for a few years had considerable local strength  and then faded away although in Minnesota  the Farmer Labor Party merged into the state s Democratic Party  which is now officially known as the Democratic Farmer Labor Party  At present  the Libertarian Party is the most successful third party  New York State has a number of additional third parties  who sometimes run their own candidates for office and sometimes nominate the nominees of the two main parties  In the District of Columbia  the D C  Statehood Party has served as a strong third party behind the Democratic Party and Republican Party  Most officials in America are elected from single member districts and win office by beating out their opponents in a system for determining winners called first past the post  the one who gets the plurality wins   which is not the same thing as actually getting a majority of votes   This encourages the two party system  see Duverger s law  In the absence of multi seat congressional districts  proportional representation is impossible and third parties cannot thrive  Although elections to the Senate elect two senators per constituency  state   staggered terms effectively result in single seat constituencies for elections to the Senate  Another critical factor has been ballot access law  Originally  voters went to the polls and publicly stated which candidate they supported  Later on  this developed into a process whereby each political party would create its own ballot and thus the voter would put the party s ballot into the voting box  In the late nineteenth century  states began to adopt the Australian Secret Ballot Method  and it eventually became the national standard  The secret ballot method ensured that the privacy of voters would be protected  hence government jobs could no longer be awarded to loyal voters  and each state would be responsible for creating one official ballot  The fact that state legislatures were dominated by Democrats and Republicans provided these parties an opportunity to pass discriminatory laws against minor political parties  yet such laws did not start to arise until the first Red Scare that hit America after World War I  State legislatures began to enact tough laws that made it harder for minor political parties to run candidates for office by requiring a high number of petition signatures from citizens and decreasing the length of time that such a petition could legally be circulated  It should also be noted that while more often than not  party members will  toe the line  and support their party s policies  they are free to vote against their own party and vote with the opposition   cross the aisle   when they please   In America the same political labels  Democratic and Republican  cover virtually all public officeholders  and therefore most voters are everywhere mobilized in the name of these two parties   says Nelson W  Polsby  professor of political science  in the book New Federalist Papers  Essays in Defense of the Constitution   Yet Democrats and Republicans are not everywhere the same  Variations  sometimes subtle  sometimes blatant  in the 50 political cultures of the states yield considerable differences overall in what it means to be  or to vote  Democratic or Republican  These differences suggest that one may be justified in referring to the American two party system as masking something more like a hundred party system    edit  Political pressure groups See also  Advocacy group Special interest groups advocate the cause of their specific constituency  Business organizations will favor low corporate taxes and restrictions of the right to strike  whereas labor unions will support minimum wage legislation and protection for collective bargaining  Other private interest groups  such as churches and ethnic groups  are more concerned about broader issues of policy that can affect their organizations or their beliefs  One type of private interest group that has grown in number and influence in recent years is the political action committee or PAC  These are independent groups  organized around a single issue or set of issues  which contribute money to political campaigns for U S  Congress or the presidency  PACs are limited in the amounts they can contribute directly to candidates in federal elections  There are no restrictions  however  on the amounts PACs can spend independently to advocate a point of view or to urge the election of candidates to office  PACs today number in the thousands    The number of interest groups has mushroomed  with more and more of them operating offices in Washington  D C   and representing themselves directly to Congress and federal agencies   says Michael Schudson in his 1998 book The Good Citizen  A History of American Civic Life   Many organizations that keep an eye on Washington seek financial and moral support from ordinary citizens  Since many of them focus on a narrow set of concerns or even on a single issue  and often a single issue of enormous emotional weight  they compete with the parties for citizens  dollars  time  and passion   The amount of money spent by these special interests continues to grow  as campaigns become increasingly expensive  Many Americans have the feeling that these wealthy interests  whether corporations  unions or PACs  are so powerful that ordinary citizens can do little to counteract their influences  A survey of members of the American Economic Association find the vast majority regardless of political affiliation to be discontent with the current state of democracy in America  The primary concern relates to the prevalence and influence of special interest groups within the political process  which tends to lead to policy consequences that only benefit such special interest groups and politicians  Some conjecture that maintenance of the policy status quo and hesitance to stray from it perpetuates a political environment that fails to advance society s welfare
