Taylor with backing from the Little Circle  a group of non conformist businessmen  4  who launched their paper after the police closure of the more radical Manchester Observer  the paper that had championed the cause of the Peterloo Massacre protesters  Taylor had been hostile to the radical reformers  writing    T hey have appealed not to the reason but the passions and the suffering of their abused and credulous fellow countrymen  from whose ill requited industry they extort for themselves the means of a plentiful and comfortable existence   They do not toil  neither do they spin   but they live better than those that do  5  And when the government closed down the Manchester Observer  the mill owners  champions had the upper hand  6  The influential journalist Jeremiah Garnett joined Taylor during the establishment of the paper  and all of the Little Circle wrote articles for the new paper  7  The prospectus announcing the new publication proclaimed that it would  zealously enforce the principles of civil and religious Liberty     warmly advocate the cause of Reform     endeavour to assist in the diffusion of just principles of Political Economy and     support  without reference to the party from which they emanate  all serviceable measures   8  The working class Manchester and Salford Advertiser called the Manchester Guardian  the foul prostitute and dirty parasite of the worst portion of the mill owners   9  The Manchester Guardian was generally hostile to labour s claims  Of the 1832 Ten Hours Bill the paper doubted whether in view of the foreign competition  the passing of a law positively enacting a gradual destruction of the cotton manufacture in this kingdom would be a much less rational procedure   10  The Manchester Guardian dismissed strikes as the work of outside agitators        if an accommodation can be effected the occupation of the agents of the Union is gone  They live on strife      11  The Manchester Guardian was hostile to the Unionist cause in the American Civil War  writing on the news that Abraham Lincoln had been assassinated   Of his rule  we can never speak except as a series of acts abhorrent to every true notion of constitutional right and human liberty      12   edit  C  P  Scott Its most famous editor  C  P  Scott  made the newspaper nationally recognised  He was editor for 57 years from 1872  and became its owner when he bought the paper from the estate of Taylor s son in 1907  Under Scott the paper s moderate editorial line became more radical  supporting Gladstone when the Liberals split in 1886  and opposing the Second Boer War against popular opinion  13  Scott supported the movement for women s suffrage  but was critical of any tactics by the Suffragettes that involved direct action  14   The really ludicrous position is that Mr Lloyd George is fighting to enfranchise seven million women and the militants are smashing unoffending people s windows and breaking up benevolent societies  meetings in a desperate effort to prevent him   Scott thought the Suffragettes   courage and devotion  was  worthy of a better cause and saner leadership   15  It has been argued that Scott s criticism reflected a widespread disdain  at the time  for those women who  transgressed the gender expectations of Edwardian society   14  Scott commissioned J M  Synge and his friend Jack Yeats to produce articles and drawings documenting the social conditions of the west of Ireland  pre First World War   and these pieces were published in 1911 in the collection Travels in Wicklow  West Kerry and Connemara  16  Scott s friendship with Chaim Weizmann played a role in the Balfour Declaration of 1917  and in 1948 The Guardian was a supporter of the new State of Israel  Daphna Baram tells the story of The Guardian s relationship with the Zionist movement and Israel in the book Disenchantment  The Guardian and Israel  17  In June 1936  ownership of the paper passed to the Scott Trust  named after the last owner  John Russell Scott  who was the first chairman of the Trust   This move ensured the paper s independence   edit  Spanish Civil War Traditionally affiliated with the centrist to centre left Liberal Party  and with a northern  non conformist circulation base  the paper earned a national reputation and the respect of the left during the Spanish Civil War  With the pro Liberal News Chronicle  the Labour supporting Daily Herald  the Communist Party s Daily Worker and several Sunday and weekly papers  it supported the Republican government against General Francisco Franco s insurgent nationalists   edit  Post war The paper so loathed Labour s left wing champion Aneurin Bevan  and the hate gospellers of his entourage  that it called for Attlee s post war Labour government to be voted out of office  18  The newspaper opposed the creation of the National Health Service as it feared the state provision of healthcare would  eliminate selective  and lead to an increase of congenitally deformed and feckless people  19  Its anti establishment stance fell short of opposing military intervention during the 1956 Suez Crisis   The government is right to be prepared for military action at Suez   because Egyptian control of the canal would be  commercially damaging for the West  and perhaps part of a plan for creating a new Arab Empire based on the Nile   20   edit  1972 to 2000  edit  Northern Ireland When 13 civil rights demonstrators were killed on 30 January 1972  known as Bloody Sunday  by British soldiers in Northern Ireland  The Guardian blamed the protesters   The organisers of the demonstration  Miss Bernadette Devlin among them  deliberately challenged the ban on marches  They knew that stone throwing and sniping could not be prevented  and that the IRA   Provisional Irish Republican Army   might use the crowd as a shield   21  Some Irish Nationalists believed that Lord Widgery s enquiry into the killings was a whitewash  22  but The Guardian declared that  Lord Widgery s report is not one sided   20 April 1972 23    The paper also supported internment without trial in Northern Ireland   Internment without trial is hateful  repressive and undemocratic  In the existing Irish situation  most regrettably  it is also inevitable       To remove the ringleaders  in the hope that the atmosphere might calm down  is a step to which there is no obvious alternative   24  And before then  The Guardian had called for British troops to be sent to the region  British soldiers could  present a more disinterested face of law and order   25  but only on condition that  Britain takes charge   26   edit  Social Democratic Party and New Labour Three of The Guardian s four leader writers joined the SDP on its foundation in 1981  but the paper was enthusiastic in its support for Tony Blair in his bid to lead the Labour Party  27  and to become Prime Minister  28   edit  Sarah Tisdall In 1983  the paper was at the centre of a controversy surrounding documents regarding the stationing of cruise missiles in Britain that were leaked to The Guardian by civil servant Sarah Tisdall  The paper eventually complied with a court order to hand over the documents to the authorities  which resulted in a six month prison sentence for Tisdall  29  though she served only four   I still blame myself   said Peter Preston who was the editor of The Guardian at the time  but he went on to argue that the paper had no choice because it  believed in the rule of law   30   edit  First Gulf war In the lead up to the first Gulf War  between 1990 and 1991  The Guardian expressed doubts about military action against Iraq   Frustration in the Gulf leads temptingly to the invocation of task forces and tactical bombing  but the military option is no option at all  The emergence yesterday of a potential hostage problem of vast dimensions only emphasised that this is far too complex a crisis for gunboat diplomacy  Loose talk of  carpet bombing  Baghdad should be put back in the bottle of theoretical but unacceptable scenarios   31  But on the eve of the war  the paper rallied to the war cause   The simple cause  at the end  is just  An evil regime in Iraq instituted an evil and brutal invasion  Our soldiers and airmen are there  at UN behest  to set that evil to rights  Their duties are clear      Let the momentum  and the resolution  be swift   32  After the event  journalist Maggie O Kane conceded that she and her colleagues had been a mouthpiece for war propaganda      we  the media  were harnessed like 2 000 beach donkeys and led through the sand to see what the British and US military wanted us to see in this nice clean war   33   edit  Jonathan Aitken In 1995  both the Granada Television programme World In Action and The Guardian were sued for libel by the then cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken  for their allegation that the Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed had paid for Aitken and his wife to stay at the H tel Ritz in Paris  which would have amounted to accepting a bribe on Aitken s part  Aitken publicly stated he would fight with  the simple sword of truth and the trusty shield of British fair play   34  The court case proceeded  and in 1997 The Guardian produced evidence that Aitken s claim of his wife paying for the hotel stay was untrue  35  In 1999  Aitken was jailed for perjury and perverting the course of justice  36   edit  Kosovo The paper supported NATO s military intervention in the Kosovo War in 1999  Though the United Nations Security Council did not support the action  The Guardian stated that  the only honourable course for Europe and America is to use military force   37 Mary Kaldor s piece was headlined  Bombs away  But to save civilians we must get in some soldiers too   38   edit  Journalist working for Russian intelligence services KGB defector Oleg Gordievsky identified prominent Guardian editor Richard Gott as one of his agents  While Gott denied that he received cash  he confessed taking benefits from the KGB  39  Gordievsky commented on the newspaper   The KGB loved the Guardian  It was deemed highly susceptible to penetration   39   edit  Since 2000 This article is in a list format that may be better presented using prose  You can help by converting this article to prose  if appropriate  Editing help is available   October 2011  In the early 2000s  The Guardian challenged the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Treason Felony Act 1848  40  41  In October 2004  The Guardian published a humorous column by Charlie Brooker in its entertainment guide  which appeared to call for the assassination of George W  Bush  42  This caused some controversy and the paper was forced to issue an apology and remove the article from its website  43  44  Following the 7 July 2005 London bombings  The Guardian published an article on its comment pages by Dilpazier Aslam  a 27 year old British Muslim journalism trainee from Yorkshire  45  Aslam was a member of Hizb ut Tahrir  an Islamist group  and had published a number of articles on their website  According to the paper  it did not know that Aslam was a member of Hizb ut Tahrir when he applied to become a trainee  though several staff members were informed of this once he started at the paper  46  The Home Office has claimed the group s  ultimate aim is the establishment of an Islamic state  Caliphate   according to Hizb ut Tahrir via non violent means   The Guardian asked Aslam to resign his membership of the group and  when he did not do so  terminated his employment  47  In early 2009  the paper started a tax investigation into a number of major UK companies  48  including publishing a database of the tax paid by the FTSE 100 companies  49  Internal documents relating to Barclays Bank s tax avoidance were removed from The Guardian s website after Barclays obtained a gagging order  50  The paper played a role in exposing the depth of the News of the World phone hacking affair   edit  Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq During the Afghanistan and Iraq wars  The Guardian attracted a proportion of anti war readers as one of the mass media outlets most critical of UK and USA military initiatives  citation needed  The paper did  however  endorse the argument that Iraq had to be disarmed of  Weapons of Mass Destruction    It is not credible to argue  as Iraq did in its initial reaction to Mr Powell  at the Security Council   that it is simply all lies      Iraq must disarm   51   edit  Accusations of bias in coverage of Israel Despite its early support for the Zionist movement  in recent decades The Guardian has been accused of biased criticism of Israeli government policy  52  In December 2003 columnist Julie Burchill cited  striking bias against the state of Israel  as one of the reasons she left the paper for The Times  53  A leaked report from the European Monitoring Centre on Racism cited The Economist s claim that for  many British Jews   the British media s reporting on Israel  is spiced with a tone of animosity   as to smell of anti Semitism     This is above all the case with the Guardian and The Independent  The EU said the report  dated February 2003 was not published because it was insubstantial in its current state and lacking sufficient evidence  54  55 Greville Janner  former president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews  has accused The Guardian of being  viciously and notoriously anti Israel   56  Responding to these accusations  a Guardian editorial in 2002 condemned anti Semitism and defended the paper s right to criticise the policies and actions of the Israeli government  arguing that those who view such criticism as inherently anti Jewish are mistaken  56  Harriet Sherwood  The Guardian s foreign editor  has also denied The Guardian has an anti Israel bias  saying that the paper aims to cover all viewpoints in the Israeli Palestinian conflict  57   edit  Clark County In August 2004  for the US presidential election  the daily G2 supplement launched an experimental letter writing campaign in Clark County  Ohio  an average sized county in a swing state  G2 editor Ian Katz bought a voter list from the county for  25 and asked readers to write to people listed as undecided in the election  giving them an impression of the international view and the importance of voting against US President George W  Bush  The paper scrapped  Operation Clark County  on 21 October 2004 after first publishing a column of complaints from Bush supporters about the campaign under the headline  Dear Limey assholes   58  The public backlash against the campaign likely contributed to Bush s victory in Clark County  59   edit  Guardian America In 2007  the paper launched a website Guardian America  an attempt to capitalise on its large online readership in the United States  which at the time stood at more than 5 9m  The company hired former American Prospect editor  New York magazine columnist and New York Review of Books writer Michael Tomasky to head up the project and hire a staff of American reporters and web editors  The site featured Guardian news relevant to an American audience  coverage of US news and the Middle East  for example  60  Tomasky stepped down from his position as Guardian American editor in February 2009  ceding editing and planning duties to other US and London staff  He retained his position as a columnist and blogger  taking the title editor at large  61  In October 2009  the company abandoned the Guardian America homepage  instead directing users to a US news index page on the main website  62  The next month  the company laid off six American employees  including a reporter  a multimedia producer and four web editors  The move came as Guardian News and Media opted to reconsider its US strategy amid a massive effort to cut costs across the company  63   edit  Gagged from reporting Parliament In October 2009  The Guardian reported that it was forbidden to report on a parliamentary matter  namely a question recorded in a Commons order paper  to be answered by a minister later that week  64  The paper noted that it was being  forbidden from telling its readers why the paper is prevented for the first time in memory from reporting parliament  Legal obstacles  which cannot be identified  involve proceedings  which cannot be mentioned  on behalf of a client who must remain secret  The only fact the Guardian can report is that the case involves the London solicitors Carter Ruck   The paper further claimed that this case appears  to call into question privileges guaranteeing free speech established under the 1688 Bill of Rights   65  The only parliamentary question mentioning Carter Ruck in the relevant period was by Paul Farrelly MP  in reference to legal action by Barclays and Trafigura  66  67  The part of the question referencing Carter Ruck relates to the latter company s September 2009 gagging order on the publication of a 2006 internal report 68  into the 2006 C te d Ivoire toxic waste dump scandal  which involved a class action case that the company only settled in September 2009 after The Guardian published some of the commodity trader s internal emails  69  The reporting injunction was lifted the next day  as Carter Ruck withdrew it before The Guardian could challenge it in the High Court  70 Alan Rusbridger credited the rapid back down of Carter Ruck to Twitter  71  as did a BBC article  72   edit  Ownership The Guardian is part of the GMG Guardian Media Group of newspapers  radio stations  print media including The Observer Sunday newspaper  The Guardian Weekly international newspaper  and new media Guardian Abroad website  and guardian co uk  All the aforementioned were owned by The Scott Trust  a charitable foundation existing between 1936 and 2008  which aimed to ensure the paper s editorial independence in perpetuity  maintaining its financial health to ensure it did not become vulnerable to take overs by for profit media groups  At the beginning of October 2008  the Scott Trusts assets were transferred to a new limited company  The Scott Trust Limited  with the intention being that the original trust would be wound up  73 Dame Liz Forgan  chair of the Scott Trust  reassured staff that the purposes of the new company remained as under the previous arrangements  The Guardian has been consistently loss making  The National Newspaper division of GMG  which also includes The Observer  reported operating losses of  49 9m in 2006  up from  18 6m in 2005  74  The paper is therefore heavily dependent on cross subsidisation from profitable companies within the group  including Auto Trader   The Guardian s ownership by the Scott Trust is a likely factor in it being the only British national daily to conduct  since 2003  an annual social  ethical and environmental audit in which it examines  under the scrutiny of an independent external auditor  its own behaviour as a company  75  It is also the only British daily national newspaper to employ an internal ombudsman  called the  readers  editor   to handle complaints and corrections  The Guardian and its parent groups participate in Project Syndicate  established by George Soros  and intervened in 1995 to save the Mail  amp  Guardian in South Africa  but Guardian Media Group sold the majority of its shares in the Mail  amp  Guardian in 2002  The continual losses made by the National Newspaper division of the Guardian Media Group caused the group to dispose of its Regional Media division by selling titles to competitor Trinity Mirror in March 2010  This included the flagship Manchester Evening News  and severed the historic link between that paper and The Guardian  The sale was in order to safeguard the future of The Guardian Newspaper as is the intended purpose of the Scott Trust  76  In June 2011 Guardian News and Media revealed increased annual losses of  33m and announced that it was looking to focus on its online edition for news coverage  leaving a physical newspaper that was to contain more comment and features  It was also speculated that the Guardian may become the first British national daily paper to go solely online  77  78   edit  Political stance and editorial opinion Founded by textile traders and merchants  The Guardian had a reputation as  an organ of the middle class   79  or in the words of C P  Scott s son Ted  a paper that will remain bourgeois to the last   80   I write for the Guardian   said Sir Max Hastings in 2005  81   because it is read by the new establishment   reflecting the paper s then growing influence  The paper s readership is generally on the mainstream left of British political opinion  a MORI poll taken between April and June 2000 showed that 80  of Guardian readers were Labour Party voters  82  according to another MORI poll taken in 2005  48  of Guardian readers were Labour voters and 34  Liberal Democrat voters  83  The newspaper s reputation as a platform for liberal and left wing opinions has led to the use of the epithet  Guardian reader  as a label for people holding such views  84  85  Guardian features editor Ian Katz stated in 2004 that       it is no secret we are a centre left newspaper       1  In 2008  Guardian columnist Jackie Ashley said that editorial contributors were a mix of  right of centre libertarians  greens  Blairites  Brownites  Labourite but less enthusiastic Brownites  etc  and that the newspaper was  clearly left of centre and vaguely progressive   She also said that  you can be absolutely certain that come the next general election  The Guardian s stance will not be dictated by the editor  still less any foreign proprietor  it helps that there isn t one  but will be the result of vigorous debate within the paper   86  The paper s comment and opinion pages  though often written by centre left contributors such as Polly Toynbee  have allowed some space for right of centre voices such as Simon Jenkins  Max Hastings and Michael Gove  In the run up to the 2010 general election  following a meeting of the editorial staff  87  the paper declared its support for the Liberal Democrats  in particular due to the party s stance on electoral reform  The paper suggested tactical voting to prevent a Conservative victory  given Britain s first past the post electoral system  88  Assistant Editor Michael White  in discussing media self censorship in March 2011  says   I have always sensed liberal  middle class ill ease in going after stories about immigration  legal or otherwise  about welfare fraud or the less attractive tribal habits of the working class  which is more easily ignored altogether  Toffs  including royal ones  Christians  especially popes  governments of Israel  and US Republicans are more straightforward targets   89   edit  Circulation and format The Guardian had a certified average daily circulation of 358 844 copies in January 2009  a drop of 5 17  on January 2008  as compared to sales of 842 912 for The Daily Telegraph  617 483 for The Times  and 215 504 for The Independent  90   edit  Publication history The Guardian s Newsroom visitor centre and archive  No 60   with an old sign with the name The Manchester Guardian The first edition was published on 5 May 1821  91  at which time The Guardian was a weekly  published on Saturdays and costing 7d   the stamp duty on newspapers  4d  per sheet  forced the price up so high that it was uneconomic to publish more frequently  When the stamp duty was cut in 1836 The Guardian added a Wednesday edition  with the abolition of the tax in 1855 it became a daily paper costing 2d  In 1952 the paper took the step of printing news on the front page  replacing the adverts that had hitherto filled that space  Then editor A  P  Wadsworth wrote   It is not a thing I like myself  but it seems to be accepted by all the newspaper pundits that it is preferable to be in fashion   In 1959 the paper dropped  Manchester  from its title  becoming simply The Guardian  and in 1964 it moved to London  losing some of its regional agenda but continuing to be heavily subsidised by sales of the less intellectual but much more profitable Manchester Evening News  The financial position remained extremely poor into the 1970s  at one time it was in merger talks with The Times  The paper consolidated its centre left stance during the 1970s and 1980s but was both shocked and revitalised by the launch of The Independent in 1986 which competed for a similar readership and provoked the entire broadsheet industry into a fight for circulation  On 12 February 1988 The Guardian had a significant redesign  as well as improving the quality of its printers  ink  it also changed its masthead to the now familiar juxtaposition of an italic Garamond  The   with a bold Helvetica  Guardian   that remained in use until the 2005 redesign  In 1992 it relaunched its features section as G2  a tabloid format supplement  This innovation was widely copied by the other  quality  broadsheets  and ultimately led to the rise of  compact  papers and The Guardian s move to the Berliner format  In 1993 the paper declined to participate in the broadsheet  price war  started by Rupert Murdoch s The Times  In June 1993  The Guardian bought The Observer from Lonrho  thus gaining a serious Sunday newspaper partner with similar political views  Its international weekly edition is now titled The Guardian Weekly  though it retained the title Manchester Guardian Weekly for some years after the home edition had moved to London  It includes sections from a number of other internationally significant newspapers of a somewhat left of centre inclination  including Le Monde  The Guardian Weekly is also linked to a website for expatriates  Guardian Abroad  which was launched in 2007 but had been taken offline by 2012  g24 is a constantly updated electronic newspaper available free of charge   2  It is downloadable as a PDF file  The contents come from The Guardian and its Sunday sibling The Observer   edit  Moving to the Berliner paper format The Guardian is printed in full colour  92  and was the first newspaper in the UK to use the Berliner format for its main section  with producing sections and supplements in a range of page sizes including tabloid  approximately A4  and pocket size  approximately A5   In 2004  The Guardian announced plans to change to a  Berliner  or  midi  format similar to that used by Die Tageszeitung in Germany  Le Monde in France and many other European papers  at 470 315 mm  this is slightly larger than a traditional tabloid  Planned for the autumn of 2005  this change followed the moves by The Independent and The Times to start publishing in tabloid  or compact  format  On Thursday 1 September 2005 The Guardian announced that it would launch the new format on Monday 12 September 2005   93  Sister Sunday newspaper The Observer went over to the same format on 8 January 2006  The advantage that The Guardian saw in the Berliner format was that though it is only a little wider than a tabloid  and is thus equally easy to read on public transport  its greater height gives more flexibility in page design  The new presses mean that printing can go right across the  gutter   the strip down the middle of the centre page  allowing the paper to print striking double page pictures  The new presses also made the paper the first UK national able to print in full colour on every page  The format switch was accompanied by a comprehensive redesign of the paper s look  On Friday 9 September 2005 the newspaper unveiled its new look front page  which d buted on Monday 12 September 2005  Designed by Mark Porter  the new look includes a new masthead for the newspaper  its first since 1988  A typeface family called Guardian Egyptian  designed by Paul Barnes and Christian Schwartz  was created for the new design  No other typeface is used anywhere in the paper  all stylistic variations are based on various forms of Guardian Egyptian  The switch cost Guardian Newspapers  80 million and involved setting up new printing presses in east London and Manchester  This was because  prior to The Guardian s move  no printing presses in Britain could produce newspapers in the Berliner format  There were additional complications as one of the paper s presses was part owned by Telegraph Newspapers and Express Newspapers  and it was contracted to use the plant until 2009  Another press was shared with the Guardian Media Group s north western tabloid local papers  which did not wish to switch to the Berliner format   edit  Reception The new format was generally well received by Guardian readers  who were encouraged to provide feedback on the changes  The only controversy was over the dropping of the Doonesbury cartoon strip  The paper reported thousands of calls and emails complaining about its loss and within 24 hours  the decision was reversed and the strip was reinstated the following week  G2 supplement editor Ian Katz  who was responsible for dropping it  apologised in the editors  blog saying   I m sorry  once again  that I made you  and the hundreds of fellow fans who have called our helpline or mailed our comments  address  so cross   94  Some readers were however dissatisfied as the earlier deadline needed for the all colour sports section meant that coverage of late finishing evening football matches became less satisfactory in the editions supplied to some parts of the country  The investment was rewarded with a circulation rise  In December 2005  the average daily sale stood at 380 693  nearly 6  higher than the figure for December 2004  95  In 2006  the US based Society for News Design chose The Guardian and Polish daily Rzeczpospolita as the world s best designed newspapers  from among 389 entries from 44 countries  96   edit  Regular content and features On each weekday The Guardian comes with the G2 supplement containing feature articles  columns  television and radio listings  and the quick crossword  Since the change to the Berliner format  there is a separate daily Sport section  Other regular supplements during the week are shown below  Before the redesign in 2005  the main news section was in the large broadsheet format  but the supplements were all in the half sized tabloid format  with the exception of the glossy Weekend section which was a 290 245 mm magazine and The Guide which was in a small 225 145 mm format  With the change of the main section to the Berliner format  the specialist sections are now printed as Berliner  as is a now daily Sports section  but G2 has moved to a  magazine sized  demi Berliner format  A Thursday Technology section and daily science coverage in the news section replaced Life and Online  Weekend and The Guide are still in the same small formats as before the change  On Monday to Thursday prior to the recession  the supplements carried substantial quantities of recruitment advertising as well as editorial on their specialised topics  However  this has diminished since the onset of recession  to the point that the

published in the paper itself  as well as many others that only appear online  Censorship is exercised by Moderators who can ban posts   with no right of appeal   by those who they feel have overstepped the mark  The Guardian has taken what they call a very  open  stance in delivering news  and have launched an open platform for their content  This allows external developers to easily use Guardian content in external applications  and even to feed third party content back into the Guardian network  103 The Guardian also had a number of talkboards that were noted for their mix of political discussion and whimsy  until they were closed on Friday 25 February 2011  104  They were spoofed in The Guardian  s own regular humorous Chatroom column in G2  The spoof column purported to be excerpts from a chatroom on permachat co uk  a real URL which pointed to The Guardian s talkboards  The paper has also launched a dating website  Soulmates  105  and is experimenting with new media  having previously offered a free twelve part weekly podcast series by Ricky Gervais  106  In January 2006 Gervais  show topped the iTunes podcast chart having been downloaded by two million listeners worldwide  107  and is scheduled to be listed in the 2007 Guinness Book of Records as the most downloaded podcast  108   edit  GuardianFilms In 2003  The Guardian started the film production company GuardianFilms  headed by journalist Maggie O Kane  Much of the company s output is documentary made for television  and it has included Salam Pax s Baghdad Blogger for BBC Two s daily flagship Newsnight  some of which have been shown in compilations by CNN International  Sex On The Streets and Spiked  both made for the UK s Channel 4 television  109   GuardianFilms was born in a sleeping bag in the Burmese rainforest   wrote O Kane in 2003  110   I was a foreign correspondent for the paper  and it had taken me weeks of negotiations  dealing with shady contacts and a lot of walking to reach the cigar smoking Karen twins  the boy soldiers who were leading attacks against the country s ruling junta  After I had reached them and written a cover story for the newspaper s G2 section  I got a call from the BBC s documentary department  which was researching a film on child soldiers  Could I give them all my contacts   The plight of the Karen people  who were forced into slave labour in the rainforest to build pipelines for oil companies  some of them British   was a tale of human suffering that needed to be told by any branch of the media that was interested  I handed over all the names and numbers I had  as well as details of the secret route through Thailand to get into Burma  Good girl  Afterwards  and not for the first time  it seemed to me that we at The Guardian should be using our resources ourselves  Instead of providing contact numbers for any independent TV company prepared to get on the phone to a journalist  we should make our own films   According to GuardianFilms s own webpage  its international work has focused on training talented local journalists based on the premise that  the era of a traditional London or Washington based foreign correspondent or fireman is coming to an end and the world urgently needs a more searching challenging journalism brought to us by people who speak the language and can secure access far beyond the  Green Zone Journalist  limits of the traditional correspondent   It says it is especially focused on reporting the Muslim world in a more challenging manner  and has trained a number of journalists in Iraq  Afghanistan and Zimbabwe  111  GuardianFilms has received several broadcasting awards  In addition to two Amnesty International Media Awards in 2004 and 2005   The Baghdad Blogger  Salam Pax

of the year at the Broadcast Awards  112  114   edit  References in popular culture The paper s nickname The Grauniad originated with the satirical magazine Private Eye  115  This anagram played on The Guardian s reputation for frequent typographical errors  such as misspelling its own name as The Gaurdian  116  The domain grauniad co uk is registered to the paper and redirects to their website  The very first issue of the newspaper contained a number of errors  perhaps the most notable being a notification that there would soon be some goods sold at atction instead of auction  There are fewer typographical errors in the paper since the end of hot metal typesetting  117  One of their writers  Keith Devlin  suggested that the high number of observed misprints was due more to the quality of the readership than their greater frequency  118   edit  Awards  edit  Received The Guardian has been awarded the National Newspaper of the Year in 1999  2006 119  and 2011 120  by the
