Rocket From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search This article is about vehicles powered by rocket engines  For other uses  see Rocket  disambiguation   A Soyuz U  at Baikonur s Site 1 5 in Kazakhstan A rocket is a missile  spacecraft  aircraft or other vehicle which obtains thrust from a rocket engine  In all rockets  the exhaust is formed entirely from propellants carried within the rocket before use  1  Rocket engines work by action and reaction  Rocket engines push rockets forwards simply by throwing their exhaust backwards extremely fast  While comparatively inefficient for low speed use  they are very lightweight and powerful  capable of generating large accelerations and of attaining extremely high speeds with reasonable efficiency  and are not reliant on the atmosphere  and so work very well in space  Rockets for military and recreational uses were invented by the Han Chinese prior to the 13th century China  2  Significant scientific  interplanetary and industrial use did not occur until the 20th century  when rocketry was the enabling technology of the Space Age  including setting foot on the moon  Rockets are now used for fireworks  weaponry  ejection seats  launch vehicles for artificial satellites  human spaceflight and space exploration  Chemical rockets are the most common type of rocket and they typically create their exhaust by the combustion of rocket propellant  Chemical rockets store a large amount of energy in an easily released form  and can be very dangerous  However  careful design  testing  construction and use minimizes risks  Contents 1 History of rockets 1 1 In antiquity 1 2 Spread of rocket technology 1 3 Metal cylinder rocket artillery 1 4 Accuracy of early rockets 1 5 Theories of

and missile technology  edit  In antiquity See also  List of Chinese inventions Early Chinese rocket  The availability of black powder  gunpowder  to propel projectiles was a precursor to the development of the first solid rocket  Ninth century Chinese Taoist alchemists discovered black powder while searching for the elixir of life  this accidental discovery led to experiments as weapons such as bombs  cannon  incendiary fire arrows and rocket propelled fire arrows  nb 1  nb 2  The discovery of gunpowder was probably the product of centuries of alchemical experimentation in which Taoist alchemists were trying to create an elixer of immortality that would allow the person ingesting it to become physically immortal  5  Exactly when the first flights of rockets occurred is contested  A common claim is that the first recorded use of a rocket in battle was by the Chinese in 1232 against the Mongol hordes at Kai Feng Fu  This is based on an old Mandarin civil service examination question which reads  Is the defense of Kai Feng Fu against the Mongols  1232  the first recorded use of cannon    6  Another question from the examinations read  Fire arms began with the use of rockets in the dynasty of Chou  B  C  1122 255   in what book do we first meet with the word p ao  now used for cannon    6  The first reliable scholarly reference to rockets in China occurs in the Ko Chieh Ching Yuan  The Mirror of Research  which states that in 998 A D  a man named Tang Fu invented a rocket of a new kind having an iron head  6  There were reports of fire arrows and  iron pots  that could be heard for 5 leagues  25 km  or 15 miles  when they exploded upon impact  causing devastation for a radius of 600 meters  2 000 feet   apparently due to shrapnel  7  The lowering of the iron pots may have been a way for a besieged army to blow up invaders  The fire arrows were either arrows with explosives attached  or arrows propelled by gunpowder  such as the Korean Hwacha  nb 3  Less controversially  one of the earliest devices recorded that used internal combustion rocket propulsion  was the  ground rat   a type of firework recorded in 1264 as having frightened the Empress Mother Kung Sheng at a feast held in her honor by her son the Emperor Lizong  9  Subsequently  one of the earliest texts to mention the use of rockets was the Huolongjing  written by the Chinese artillery officer Jiao Yu in the mid 14th century  This text also mentioned the use of the first known multistage rocket  the  fire dragon issuing from the water   huo long chu shui   used mostly by the Chinese navy  10   edit  Spread of rocket technology Ryusei Festival at Yoshida town  Chichibu city  Saitama  Japan Rocket technology first became known to Europeans following its use by the Mongols Genghis Khan and  gedei Khan when they conquered parts of Russia  Eastern  and Central Europe  The Mongolians had acquired the Chinese technology by conquest of the northern part of China and by the subsequent employment of Chinese rocketry experts as mercenaries for the Mongol military  Reports of the Battle of Mohi in the year 1241 describe the use of rocket like weapons by the Mongols against the Magyars  7  Rocket technology also spread to Korea  with the 15th century wheeled hwacha that would launch singijeon rockets  Additionally  the spread of rockets into Europe was also influenced by the Ottomans at the siege of Constantinople in 1453  although it is very likely that the Ottomans themselves were influenced by the Mongol invasions of the previous few centuries  In their history of rockets published on the Internet  NASA says  Rockets appear in Arab literature in 1258 A D   describing Mongol invaders  use of them on February 15 to capture the city of Baghdad   7  Between 1270 and 1280  Hasan al Rammah wrote al furusiyyah wa al manasib al harbiyya  The Book of Military Horsemanship and Ingenious War Devices   which included 107 gunpowder recipes  22 of which are for rockets  11  According to Ahmad Y Hassan  al Rammah s recipes were more explosive than rockets used in China at the time  12  unreliable source   The terminology used by al Rammah indicated a Chinese origin for the gunpowder weapons he wrote about  such as rockets and fire lances  13 Ibn al Baytar  an Arab from Spain who had immigrated to Egypt  gave the name  snow of China   Arabic             thalj al Sin  to describe saltpetre  Al Baytar died in 1248  14  15  The earlier Arab historians call saltpeter  Chinese snow  and   Chinese salt    16  17  The Arabs also used the name  Chinese arrows  to refer to rockets  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  The Arabs attached  Chinese  to various names for gunpowder related objects   Chinese flowers  was the name for fireworks  while  Chinese Snow  was given to saltpeter and  Chinese arrows  to rockets  25  While saltpeter was called  Chinese Snow  by Arabs  it was called  Chinese salt  by the Iranians Persians  26  27  28  29  30  The name Rocket comes from the Italian Rocchetta  i e  little fuse   a name of a small firecracker created by the Italian artificer Muratori in 1379  31  Kyeser was infatuated with the legend of Alexander the Great  here Alexander holds a rocket  the first depiction of one Konrad Kyeser described rockets in his famous military treatise Bellifortis around 1405  32  Between 1529 and 1556 Conrad Haas wrote a book in which he described rocket technology  involving the combination of fireworks and weapons technologies  This manuscript was discovered in 1961  in the Sibiu public records  Sibiu public records Varia II 374   His work dealt with the theory of motion of multi stage rockets  different fuel mixtures using liquid fuel  and introduced delta shape fins and bell shaped nozzles  33  For over two centuries  the work of Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth nobleman Kazimierz Siemienowicz  Artis Magnae Artilleriae pars prima    Great Art of Artillery  the First Part   also known as  The Complete Art of Artillery    was used in Europe as a basic artillery manual  34  First printed in Amsterdam in 1650 it was translated to French in 1651  German in 1676  English and Dutch in 1729 and Polish in 1963  The book provided the standard designs for creating rockets  fireballs  and other pyrotechnic devices  It contained a large chapter on caliber  construction  production and properties of rockets  for both military and civil purposes   including multi stage rockets  batteries of rockets  and rockets with delta wing stabilizers  instead of the common guiding rods    edit  Metal cylinder rocket artillery In 1792  the first iron cased rockets were successfully developed and used by Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan  rulers of the Kingdom of Mysore in India against the larger British East India Company forces during the Anglo Mysore Wars  The British then took an active interest in the technology and developed it further during the 19th century  The Mysore rockets of this period were much more advanced than the British had previously seen  chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant  this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missile  up to 2 km range   After Tipu s eventual defeat in the Fourth Anglo Mysore War and the capture of the Mysore iron rockets  they were influential in British rocket development  inspiring the Congreve rocket  which was soon put into use in the Napoleonic Wars  35   edit  Accuracy of early rockets The Congreve rocket William Congreve  son of the Comptroller of the Royal Arsenal  Woolwich  London  became a major figure in the field  From 1801  Congreve researched on the original design of Mysore rockets and set on a vigorous development program at the Arsenal s laboratory  36  Congreve prepared a new propellant mixture  and developed a rocket motor with a strong iron tube with conical nose  This early Congreve rocket weighed about 32 pounds  14 5 kilograms   The Royal Arsenal s first demonstration of solid fuel rockets was in 1805  The rockets were effectively used during the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812  Congreve published three books on rocketry  37  From there  the use of military rockets spread throughout the western world  At the Battle of Baltimore in 1814  the rockets fired on Fort McHenry by the rocket vessel HMS Erebus were the source of the rockets  red glare described by Francis Scott Key in The Star Spangled Banner  38  Rockets were also used in the Battle of Waterloo  39  Early rockets were very inaccurate  Without the use of spinning or any gimballing of the thrust  they had a strong tendency to veer sharply off course  The early Mysorean rockets and their successor British Congreve rockets 36  reduced this somewhat by attaching a long stick to the end of a rocket  similar to modern bottle rockets  to make it harder for the rocket to change course  The largest of the Congreve rockets was the 32 pound  14 5 kg  Carcass  which had a 15 foot  4 6 m  stick  Originally  sticks were mounted on the side  but this was later changed to mounting in the center of the rocket  reducing drag and enabling the rocket to be more accurately fired from a segment of pipe  The accuracy problem was greatly improved in 1844 when William Hale 40  modified the rocket design so that thrust was slightly vectored  causing the rocket to spin along its axis of travel like a bullet  The Hale rocket removed the need for a rocket stick  travelled further due to reduced air resistance  and was far more accurate   edit  Theories of interplanetary rocketry Konstantin Tsiolkovsky published the first work on space travel  which was inspired by the writings of Jules Verne At the beginning of the 20th Century  there was a burst of scientific investigation into interplanetary travel  largely driven by the inspiration of fiction by writers such as Jules Verne and H G Wells  Scientists seized on the rocket as a technology that was able to achieve this in real life  In 1903  high school mathematics teacher Konstantin Tsiolkovsky  1857 1935   published                                                        41   The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices   the first serious scientific work on space travel  The Tsiolkovsky rocket equation the principle that governs rocket propulsion is named in his honor  although it had been discovered previously   42  He also advocated the use of liquid hydrogen and oxygen for propellant  calculating their maximum exhaust velocity  His work was essentially unknown outside the Soviet Union  but inside the country it inspired further research  experimentation and the formation of the Society for Studies of Interplanetary Travel in 1924  In 1912  Robert Esnault Pelterie published a lecture 43  on rocket theory and interplanetary travel  He independently derived Tsiolkovsky s rocket equation  did basic calculations about the energy required to make round trips to the Moon and planets  and he proposed the use of atomic power  i e  Radium  to power a jet drive  Robert Goddard In 1912 Robert Goddard  inspired from an early age by H G Wells  began a serious analysis of rockets  concluding that conventional solid fuel rockets needed to be improved in three ways  First  fuel should be burned in a small combustion chamber  instead of building the entire propellant container to withstand the high pressures  Second  rockets could be arranged in stages  Finally  the exhaust speed  and thus the efficiency  could be greatly increased to beyond the speed of sound by using a De Laval nozzle  He patented these concepts in 1914  44  He  also  independently developed the mathematics of rocket flight  In 1920  Goddard published these ideas and experimental results in A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes  45  The work included remarks about sending a solid fuel rocket to the Moon  which attracted worldwide attention and was both praised and ridiculed  A New York Times editorial suggested    That Professor Goddard  with his  chair  in Clark College and the countenancing of the Smithsonian Institution  does not know the relation of action to reaction  and of the need to have something better than a vacuum against which to react    to say that would be absurd  Of course he only seems to lack the knowledge ladled out daily in high schools     New York Times  13 January 1920 46  In 1923  Hermann Oberth  1894 1989  published Die Rakete zu den Planetenr umen   The Rocket into Planetary Space    a version of his doctoral thesis  after the University of Munich rejected it  47  In 1924  Tsiolkovsky also wrote about multi stage rockets  in  Cosmic Rocket Trains  48   edit  Modern rocketry  edit  Pre World War II Robert Goddard and the first liquid fueled rocket  Modern rockets were born when Goddard attached a supersonic  de Laval  nozzle to a liquid fueled rocket engine s combustion chamber  These nozzles turn the hot gas from the combustion chamber into a cooler  hypersonic  highly directed jet of gas  more than doubling the thrust and raising the engine efficiency from 2  to 64   49  50  In 1926  Robert Goddard launched the world s first liquid fueled rocket in Auburn  Massachusetts  During the 1920s  a number of rocket research organizations appeared worldwide  In 1927 the German car manufacturer Opel began to research rocket vehicles together with Mark Valier and the solid fuel rocket builder Friedrich Wilhelm Sander  51  In 1928  Fritz von Opel drove with a rocket car  the Opel RAK 1 on the Opel raceway in R sselsheim  Germany  In 1928 the Lippisch Ente flew  rocket power was used to launch the manned glider  although it was destroyed on its second flight  In 1929 von Opel started at the Frankfurt Rebstock airport with the Opel Sander RAK 1 airplane  which was damaged beyond repair during a hard landing after its first flight  In the mid 1920s  German scientists had begun experimenting with rockets which used liquid propellants capable of reaching relatively high altitudes and distances  In 1927 and also in Germany  a team of amateur rocket engineers had formed the Verein f r Raumschiffahrt  German Rocket Society  or VfR   and in 1931 launched a liquid propellant rocket  using oxygen and gasoline   52  From 1931 to 1937 in Russia  extensive scientific work on rocket engine design occurred in Leningrad at the Gas Dynamics Laboratory there  Well funded and staffed  over 100 experimental engines were built under the direction of Valentin Glushko  The work included regenerative cooling  hypergolic propellant ignition  and fuel injector designs that included swirling and bi propellant mixing injectors  However  the work was curtailed by Glushko s arrest during Stalinist purges in 1938  Similar work was also done by the Austrian professor Eugen S nger who worked on rocket powered spaceplanes such as Silbervogel  sometimes called the  antipodal  bomber   53  On November 12  1932 at a farm in Stockton NJ  the American Interplanetary Society s attempt to static fire their first rocket  based on German Rocket Society designs  failed in a fire  54  In 1930s  the Reichswehr  which in 1935 became the Wehrmacht  began to take an interest in rocketry  55  Artillery restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles limited Germany s access to long distance weaponry  Seeing the possibility of using rockets as long range artillery fire  the Wehrmacht initially funded the VfR team  but because their focus was strictly scientific  created its own research team  At the behest of military leaders  Wernher von Braun  at the time a young aspiring rocket scientist  joined the military  followed by two former VfR members  and developed long range weapons for use in World War II by Nazi Germany  56   edit  World War II A German V 2 rocket on a Meillerwagen Layout of a V2 rocket In 1943  production of the V 2 rocket began in Germany  It had an operational range of 300 km  190 mi  and carried a 1 000 kg  2 200 lb  warhead  with an amatol explosive charge  It normally achieved an operational maximum altitude of around 90 km  56 mi   but could achieve 206 km  128 mi  if launched vertically  The vehicle was similar to most modern rockets  with turbopumps  inertial guidance and many other features  Thousands were fired at various Allied nations  mainly Belgium  as well as England and France  While they could not be intercepted  their guidance system design and single conventional warhead meant that it was insufficiently accurate against military targets  A total of 2 754 people in England were killed  and 6 523 were wounded before the launch campaign was ended  There were also 20 000 deaths of slave labour during the construction of V 2s  While it did not significantly affect the course of the war  the V 2 provided a lethal demonstration of the potential for guided rockets as weapons  57  58  In parallel with the guided missile programme in Nazi Germany  rockets were also used on aircraft  either for assisting horizontal take off  JATO   vertical take off  Bachem Ba 349  Natter   or for powering them  Me 163  59  etc    During the war Germany also developed several guided and unguided air to air  ground to air and ground to ground missiles  see list of World War II guided missiles of Germany   The Allies rocket programs were much less sophisticated  relying mostly on unguided missiles like the Soviet Katyusha rocket   edit  Post World War II Dornberger and Von Braun after being captured by the Allies R 7 8K72  Vostok  permanently displayed at the Moscow Trade Fair at Ostankino  the rocket is held in place by its railway carrier  which is mounted on four diagonal beams that constitute the display pedestal  Here the railway carrier has tilted the rocket upright as it would do so into its launch pad structure    which is missing for this display  At the end of World War II  competing Russian  British  and US military and scientific crews raced to capture technology and trained personnel from the German rocket program at Peenem nde  Russia and Britain had some success  but the United States benefited the most  The US captured a large number of German rocket scientists  many of whom were members of the Nazi Party  including von Braun  and brought them to the United States as part of Operation Overcast  60  In America  the same rockets that were designed to rain down on Britain were used instead by scientists as research vehicles for developing the new technology further  The V 2 evolved into the American Redstone rocket  used in the early space program  61  After the war  rockets were used to study high altitude conditions  by radio telemetry of temperature and pressure of the atmosphere  detection of cosmic rays  and further research  notably for the Bell X 1 to break the sound barrier  This continued in the US under von Braun and the others  who were destined to become part of the US scientific community  Independently  in the Soviet Union s space program research continued under the leadership of the chief designer Sergei Korolev  62  With the help of German technicians  the V 2 was duplicated and improved as the R 1  R 2 and R 5 missiles  German designs were abandoned in the late 1940s  and the foreign workers were sent home  A new series of engines built by Glushko and based on inventions of Aleksei Mihailovich Isaev formed the basis of the first ICBM  the R 7  63  The R 7 launched the first satellite  Sputnik 1  and later Yuri Gagarin the first man into space  and the first lunar and planetary probes  This rocket is still in use today  These prestigious events attracted the attention of top politicians  along with additional funds for further research  One problem that had not been solved was atmospheric reentry  It had been shown that an orbital vehicle easily had enough kinetic energy to vaporize itself  and yet it was known that meteorites can make it down to the ground  The mystery was solved in the US in 1951 when H  Julian Allen and A  J  Eggers  Jr  of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics  NACA  made the counterintuitive discovery 64  that a blunt shape  high drag  permitted the most effective heat shield  With this type of shape  around 99  of the energy goes into the air rather than vehicle  and this permitted safe recovery of orbital vehicles  The Allen and Eggers discovery  though initially treated as a military secret  was eventually published in 1958  65  The Blunt Body Theory made possible the heat shield designs that were embodied in the Mercury and all other space capsules and space planes  enabling astronauts to survive the fiery re entry into Earth s atmosphere  Prototype of the Mk 2 Reentry Vehicle  RV   based on blunt body theory  edit  Cold War Rockets became extremely important militarily as modern intercontinental ballistic missiles  ICBMs  when it was realized that nuclear weapons carried on a rocket vehicle were essentially impossible for existing defense systems to stop once launched  and ICBM Launch vehicles such as the R 7  Atlas and Titan became the delivery platform of choice for these weapons  Von Braun s rocket team in 1961 Fueled partly by the Cold War  the 1960s became the decade of rapid development of rocket technology particularly in the Soviet Union  Vostok  Soyuz  Proton  and in the United States  e g  the X 15 66  and X 20 Dyna Soar 67  aircraft   There was also significant research in other countries  such as Britain  Japan  Australia  etc   and a growing use of rockets for Space exploration  with pictures returned from the far side of the Moon and unmanned flights for Mars exploration  In America the manned programmes  Project Mercury  Project Gemini and later the Apollo programme culminated in 1969 with the first manned landing on the moon via the Saturn V  causing the New York Times to retract their earlier editorial implying that spaceflight couldn t work    Further investigation and experimentation have confirmed the findings of Isaac Newton in the 17th century and it is now definitely established that a rocket can function in a vacuum as well as in an atmosphere  The Times regrets the error     New York Times  17 June 1969   A Correction 68  In the 1970s America made further lunar landings  before cancelling the Apollo programme in 1975  The replacement vehicle  the partially reusable  Space Shuttle  was intended to be cheaper  69  but this large reduction in costs was largely not achieved  Meanwhile in 1973  the expendable Ariane programme was begun  a launcher that by the year 2000 would capture much of the geosat market   edit  Current day SpaceShipOne Rockets remain a popular military weapon  The use of large battlefield rockets of the V 2 type has given way to guided missiles  However rockets are often used by helicopters and light aircraft for ground attack  being more powerful than machine guns  but without the recoil of a heavy cannon and by the early 1960s air to air missiles became favored  Shoulder launched rocket weapons are widespread in the anti tank role due to their simplicity  low cost  light weight  accuracy and high level of damage  Current artillery systems such as the MLRS or BM 30 Smerch launch multiple rockets to saturate battlefield targets with munitions  citation needed  Economically  rocketry is the enabler of all space technologies particularly satellites  many of which impact people s everyday lives in almost countless ways  70  Scientifically  rocketry has opened a window on the universe  allowing the launch of space probes to explore the solar system and space based telescopes to obtain a clearer view of the rest of the universe  71  However  it is probably manned spaceflight that has predominantly caught the imagination of the public  Vehicles such as the Space Shuttle for scientific research  the Soyuz increasingly for orbital tourism and SpaceShipOne for suborbital tourism may show a trend towards greater commercialisation of manned rocketry  72   edit  Types Vehicle configurations Saturn V is the biggest rocket to have successfully flown  Launch of Apollo 15 Saturn V rocket  T   30 s through T   40 s Rocket vehicles are often constructed in the archetypal tall thin  rocket  shape that takes off vertically  but there are actually many different types of rockets including  73  74  tiny models such as balloon rockets  water rockets  skyrockets or small solid rockets that can be purchased at a hobby store missiles space rockets such as the enormous Saturn V used for the Apollo program rocket cars rocket bike rocket powered aircraft  including rocket assisted takeoff of conventional aircraft  JATO  rocket sleds rocket trains rocket torpedos 75  76  rocket powered jet packs 77  rapid escape systems such as ejection seats and launch escape systems space probes  edit  Design A rocket design can be as simple as a cardboard tube filled with black powder  but to make an efficient  accurate rocket or missile involves overcoming a number of difficult problems  The main difficulties include cooling the combustion chamber  pumping the fuel  in the case of a liquid fuel   and controlling and correcting the direction of motion  78   edit  Components Rockets consist of a propellant  a place to put propellant  such as a propellant tank   and a nozzle  They may also have one or more rocket engines  directional stabilization device s   such as fins  vernier engines or engine gimbals for thrust vectoring  gyroscopes  and a structure  typically monocoque  to hold these components together  Rockets intended for high speed atmospheric use also have an aerodynamic fairing such as a nose cone  which usually holds the payload  79  As well as these components  rockets can have any number of other components  such as wings  rocketplanes   parachutes  wheels  rocket cars   even  in a sense  a person  rocket belt   Vehicles frequently possess navigation systems and guidance systems which typically use satellite navigation and inertial navigation systems   edit  Engines Main article  rocket engine Rocket engines employ the principle of jet propulsion  1  The rocket engines powering rockets come in a great variety of different types  a comprehensive list can be found in rocket engine  Most current rockets are chemically powered rockets  usually internal combustion engines  80  but some employ a decomposing monopropellant  that emit a hot exhaust gas  A rocket engine can use gas propellants  solid propellant  liquid propellant  or a hybrid mixture of both solid and liquid  1  Some rockets use heat or pressure that is supplied from a source other than the chemical reaction of propellant s   such as steam rockets  solar thermal rockets  nuclear thermal rocket engines or simple pressurized rockets such as water rocket or cold gas thrusters  1  With combustive propellants a chemical reaction is initiated between the fuel and the oxidizer in the combustion chamber  and the resultant hot gases accelerate out of a rocket engine nozzle  or nozzles  at the rearward facing end of the rocket  The acceleration of these gases through the engine exerts force   thrust   on the combustion chamber and nozzle  propelling the vehicle  according to Newton s Third Law   1   edit  Propellant Main article  Rocket propellant Rocket propellant is mass that is stored  usually in some form of propellant tank or casing  prior to being used as the propulsive mass that is ejected from a rocket engine in the form of a fluid jet to produce thrust  1  For chemical rockets often the propellants are a fuel such as liquid hydrogen or kerosene which is burned with an oxidizer such as liquid oxygen or nitric acid to produce large volumes of very hot gas  The oxidiser is either kept separate and mixed in the combustion chamber  or comes premixed  as with solid rockets  Sometimes the propellant is not burned but still undergoes a chemical reaction  and can be a  monopropellant  such as hydrazine  nitrous oxide or hydrogen peroxide that can be catalytically decomposed to hot gas  Alternatively  an inert propellant can be used that can be externally heated  such as in steam rocket  solar thermal rocket or nuclear thermal rockets  1  For smaller  low performance  rockets such as attitude control thrusters where high performance is less necessary  a pressurised fluid is used as propellant that simply escapes the spacecraft through a propelling nozzle  1   edit  Uses Rockets or other similar reaction devices carrying their own propellant must be used when there is no other substance  land  water  or air  or force  gravity  magnetism  light  that a vehicle may usefully employ for propulsion  such as in space  In these circumstances  it is necessary to carry all the propellant to be used  However  they are also useful in other situations   edit  Military Arrow anti ballistic missile launch Some military weapons use rockets to propel warheads to their targets  A rocket and its payload together are generally referred to as a missile when the weapon has a guidance system  not all missiles use rocket engines  some use other engines such as jets  or as a rocket if it is unguided  Anti tank and anti aircraft missiles use rocket engines to engage targets at high speed at a range of several miles  while intercontinental ballistic missiles can be used to deliver multiple nuclear warheads thousands of miles  and anti ballistic missiles try to stop them   edit  Science and research A Bumper sounding rocket See also  Space probe Sounding rockets are commonly used to carry instruments that take readings from 50 kilometres  31 mi  to 1 500 kilometres  930 mi  above the surface of the Earth  the altitudes between those reachable by weather balloons and satellites  81  Rocket engines are also used to propel rocket sleds along a rail at extremely high speed  The world record for this is Mach 8 5  82   edit  Spaceflight Space Shuttle Atlantis during launch phase Main article  Spaceflight Larger rockets are normally launched from a launch pad which serves as stable support until a few seconds after ignition  Due to their high exhaust velocity 2 500 to 4 500 m s  9 000 to 16 000 km h  5 600 to 10 000 mph   Mach  10   rockets are particularly useful when very high speeds are required  such as orbital speed  Mach 24  83    Spacecraft delivered into orbital trajectories become artificial satellites which are used for many commercial purposes  Indeed  rockets remain the only way to launch spacecraft into orbit and beyond  84  They are also used to rapidly accelerate spacecraft when they change orbits or de orbit for landing  Also  a rocket may be used to soften a hard parachute landing immediately before touchdown  see retrorocket    edit  Rescue Apollo LES pad abort test with boilerplate crew module  Rockets were used to propel a line to a stricken ship so that a Breeches buoy can be used to rescue those on board  Rockets are also used to launch emergency flares  Some crewed rockets  notably the Saturn V 85  and Soyuz 86  have launch escape systems  This is a small  usually solid rocket that is capable of pulling the crewed capsule away from the main vehicle towards safety at a moments notice  These types of systems have been operated several times  both in testing and in flight  and operated correctly each time  citation needed  Solid rocket propelled ejection seats are used in many military aircraft to propel crew away to safety from a vehicle when flight control is lost  87   edit  Hobby  sport and entertainment Hobbyists build and fly a wide variety of model rockets  Many companies produce model rocket kits and parts but due to their inherent simplicity some hobbyists have been known to make rockets out of almost anything  Rockets are also used in some types of consumer and professional fireworks  Hydrogen peroxide rockets are used to power jet packs  88  and have been used to power cars and a rocket car holds the all time  albeit unofficial  drag racing record  89   edit  Noise For all but the very smallest sizes  rocket exhaust compared to other engines is generally very noisy  As the hypersonic exhaust mixes with the ambient air  shock waves are formed  The sound intensity from these shock waves depends on the size of the rocket as well as the exhaust speed  The sound intensity of large  high performance rockets could potentially kill at close range  90  The Space Shuttle generates over 200 dB A  of noise around its base  A Saturn V launch was detectable on seismometers a considerable distance from the launch site  Noise is generally most intense when a rocket is close to the ground  since the noise from the engines radiates up away from the plume  as well as reflecting off the ground  This noise can be reduced somewhat by flame trenches with roofs  by water injection around the plume and by deflecting the plume at an angle  90  For crewed rockets various methods are used to reduce the sound intensity for the passengers  and typically the placement of the astronauts far away from the rocket engines helps significantly  For the passengers and crew  when a vehicle goes supersonic the sound cuts off as the sound waves are no longer able to keep up with the vehicle  90   edit  Physics  edit  Operation A diagram of how a rocket engine works  Main article  Rocket engine The action of the rocket engine s combustion chambers and expansion nozzles on a high pressure fluid is able to accelerate the fluid to extremely high speed  and conversely this exerts a large reactive thrust on the rocket  an equal and opposite reaction according to Newton s third law  which propels the rocket forwards  Rocket thrust is caused by pressures acting on the combustion chamber and nozzle In a closed chamber  the pressures are equal in each direction and no acceleration occurs  If an opening is provided in the bottom of the chamber then the pressure is no longer acting on the missing section  This opening permits the exhaust to escape  The remaining pressures give a resultant thrust on the side opposite the opening  and these pressures are what push the rocket along  Using a nozzle gives more force as well since the exhaust also presses on it as it expands outwards  roughly doubling the total force  If propellant gas is continuously added to the chamber then these pressures can be maintained for as long as propellant remains  1  As a side effect  these pressures on the rocket also act on the exhaust in the opposite direction and accelerate this to very high speeds  according to Newton s Third Law   1  From the principle of conservation of momentum the speed of the exhaust of a rocket determines how much momentum increase is created for a given amount of propellant  This is called the rocket s specific impulse  1  Because a rocket  propellant and exhaust in flight  without any external perturbations  may be considered as a closed system  the total momentum is always constant  Therefore  the faster the net speed of the exhaust in one direction  the greater the speed of the rocket can achieve in the opposite direction  This is especially true since the rocket body s mass is typically far lower than the final total exhaust mass  As the remaining propellant decreases  rocket vehicles become lighter and their acceleration tends to increase until the propellant is exhausted  This means that much of the speed change occurs towards the end of the burn when the vehicle is much lighter  1   edit  Forces on a rocket in flight Forces on a rocket in flight  rockets that must travel through the air are usually tall and thin as this shape gives a high ballistic coefficient and minimizes drag losses The general study of the forces on a rocket or other spacecraft is part of ballistics and is called astrodynamics  Flying rockets are primarily affected by the following  91  Thrust from the engine s  Gravity from celestial bodies Drag if moving in atmosphere Lift  usually relatively small effect except for rocket powered aircraft In addition  the inertia and centrifugal pseudo force can be significant due to the path of the rocket around the center of a celestial body  when high enough speeds in the right direction and altitude are achieved a stable orbit or escape velocity is obtained  These forces  with a stabilizing tail  the empennage  present will  unless deliberate control efforts are made  naturally cause the vehicle to follow a roughly parabolic trajectory termed a gravity turn  and this trajectory is often used at least during the initial part of a launch   This is true even if the rocket engine is mounted at the nose   Vehicles can thus maintain low or even zero angle of attack which minimizes transverse stress on the launch vehicle  permitting a weaker  and hence lighter  launch vehicle  92  93   edit  Net thrust Due to the supersonic nature of the exhaust jet the exit pressure can be different to ambient atmospheric pressure  Nozzles are said to be  top to bottom     Underexpanded  above ambient     Ambient    Overexpanded  below ambient     Grossly overexpanded  If under or overexpanded then loss of efficiency occurs  grossly overexpanded nozzles lose less efficiency  but the exhaust jet is usually unstable  Rockets become progressively more underexpanded as they gain altitude  Note that almost all rocket engines will be momentarily grossly overexpanded during startup in an atmosphere  94  For a more detailed model of the net thrust of a rocket engine that includes the effect of atmospheric pressure  see Rocket engine Net thrust  A typical rocket engine can handle a significant fraction of its own mass in propellant each second  with the propellant leaving the nozzle at several kilometres per second  This means that the thrust to weight ratio of a rocket engine  and often the entire vehicle can be very high  in extreme cases over 100  This compares with other jet propulsion engines that can exceed 5 for some of the better 95  engines  96  The propellant flow rate of a rocket is often deliberately varied over a flight  to provide a way to control the thrust and thus the airspeed of the vehicle  This  for example  allows minimization of aerodynamic losses 97  and can limit the increase of g forces due to the reduction in propellant load  It can be shown that the net thrust of a rocket is   98  where  propellant flow  kg s or lb s  the effective exhaust velocity  m s or ft s  The effective exhaust velocity is more or less the speed the exhaust leaves the vehicle  and in the vacuum of space  the effective exhaust velocity is often equal to the actual average exhaust speed along the thrust axis  However  the effective exhaust velocity allows for various losses  and notably  is reduced when operated within an atmosphere   edit  Impulse Main article  Impulse The total impulse of a rocket burning its propellant is simply  99  When there is fixed thrust  this is simply   edit  Specific impulse Main article  specific impulse As can be seen from the thrust equation the effective speed of the exhaust controls the amount of thrust produced from a particular quantity of fuel burnt per second  An equivalent measure  the net thrust seconds  impulse  per weight unit of propellant expelled is called specific Impulse    and this is one of the most important figures that describes a rocket s performance  It is defined such that it is related to the effective exhaust velocity by   100  where  has units of seconds is the acceleration at the surface of the Earth Thus  the greater the specific impulse  the greater the net thrust and performance of the engine  is determined by measurement while testing the engine  In practice the effective exhaust velocities of rockets varies but can be extremely high   4500 m s  about 15 times the sea level speed of sound in air  Typical performances of common propellants

equation The delta v capacity of a rocket is the theoretical total change in velocity that a rocket can achieve without any external interference  without air drag or gravity or other forces   When is constant  the delta v that a rocket vehicle can provide can be calculated from the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation  103  where  is the initial total mass  including propellant  in kg  or lb  is the final total mass in kg  or lb  is the effective exhaust velocity in m s or  ft s  is the delta v in m s  or ft s  When launched from the Earth practical delta v s for a single rockets carrying payloads can be a few km s  Some theoretical designs have rockets with delta v s over 9 km s  The required delta v can also be calculated for a particular manoeuvre  for example the delta v to launch from the surface of the Earth to Low earth orbit is about 9 7 km s  which leaves the vehicle with a sideways speed of about 7 8 km s at an altitude of around 200 km  In this manoeuvre about 1 9 km s is lost in air drag  gravity drag and gaining altitude  The ratio is sometimes called the mass ratio   edit  Mass ratios The Tsiolkovsky rocket equation gives a relationship between the mass ratio and the final velocity in multiples of the exhaust speed Main article  mass ratio Persons not familiar with spaceflight rarely realize that almost all of a launch vehicle s mass consists of propellant  104  Mass ratio is  for any  burn   the ratio between the rocket s initial mass and the mass after  105  Everything else being equal  a high mass ratio is desirable for good performance  since it indicates that the rocket is lightweight and hence performs better  for essentially the same reasons that low weight is desirable in sports cars  Rockets as a group have the highest thrust to weight ratio of any type of engine  and this helps vehicles achieve high mass ratios  which improves the performance of flights  The higher the ratio  the less engine mass is needed to be carried  This permits the carrying of even more propellant  enormously improving the delta v  Alternatively  some rockets such as for rescue scenarios or racing carry relatively little propellant and payload and thus need only a lightweight structure and instead achieve high accelerations  For example  the Soyuz escape system can produce 20g  86  Achievable mass ratios are highly dependent on many factors such as propellant type  the design of engine the vehicle uses  structural safety margins and construction techniques  The highest mass ratios are generally achieved with liquid rockets  and these types are usually used for orbital launch vehicles  a situation which calls for a high delta v  Liquid propellants generally have densities similar to water  with the notable exceptions of liquid hydrogen and liquid methane   and these types are able to use lightweight  low pressure tanks and typically run high performance turbopumps to force the propellant into the combustion chamber  Some notable mass fractions are found in the following table  some aircraft are included for comparison purposes   Vehicle Takeoff Mass Final Mass Mass ratio Mass fraction Ariane 5  vehicle   payload  746 000 kg  106    1 645 000 lb

dropping off unnecessary parts of the rocket to reduce mass Apollo 6 while dropping the interstage ring Main article  Multistage rocket Often  the required velocity  delta v  for a mission is unattainable by any single rocket because the propellant  tankage  structure  guidance  valves and engines and so on  take a particular minimum percentage of take off mass that is too great for the propellant it carries to achieve that delta v  For example the first stage of the Saturn V  carrying the weight of the upper stages  was able to achieve a mass ratio of about 10  and achieved a specific impulse of 263 seconds  This gives a delta v of around 5 9 km s whereas around 9 4 km s delta v is needed to achieve orbit with all losses allowed for  This problem is frequently solved by staging   the rocket sheds excess weight  usually empty tankage and associated engines  during launch  Staging is either serial where the rockets light after the previous stage has fallen away  or parallel  where rockets are burning together and then detach when they burn out  111  The maximum speeds that can be achieved with staging is theoretically limited only by the speed of light  However the payload that can be carried goes down geometrically with each extra stage needed  while the additional delta v for each stage is simply additive   edit  Acceleration and thrust to weight ratio Main article  thrust to weight ratio From Newton s second law  the acceleration    of a vehicle is simply  Where m is the instantaneous mass of the vehicle and is the net force acting on the rocket  mostly thrust but air drag and other forces can play a part   Typically  the acceleration of a rocket increases with time  if the thrust stays the same  as the weight of the rocket decreases as propellant is burned  but the thrust can be throttled to offset or vary this if needed  Discontinuities in acceleration will also occur when stages burn out  often starting at a lower acceleration with each new stage firing  Peak accelerations can be increased by designing the vehicle with a reduced mass  usually achieved by a reduction in the fuel load and tankage and associated structures  but obviously this reduces range  delta v and burn time  Still  for some applications that rockets are used for  a high peak acceleration applied for just a short time is highly desirable  The minimal mass of vehicle consists of a rocket engine with minimal fuel and structure to carry it  In that case the thrust to weight ratio nb 4  of the rocket engine limits the maximum acceleration that can be designed  It turns out that rocket engines generally have truly excellent thrust to weight ratios  137 for the NK 33 engine  113  some solid rockets are over 1000 112    and nearly all really high g vehicles employ or have employed rockets  The high accelerations that rockets naturally possess means that rocket vehicles are often capable of vertical takeoff  this can be done provided the vehicles engines provide more than the local gravitational acceleration away from the Earth or gravity source   edit  Drag Drag is a force which acts opposite to the direction of the rocket s motion  This will cause a decrease in the acceleration of the vehicle whilst also producing structural loads  The deceleration force for fast moving rockets can be calculated using the drag equation  Drag can be minimised by an aerodynamic nose cone and by using a shape with a high ballistic coefficient  the  classic  rocket shape long and thin   and by keeping the rocket s angle of attack as low as possible  During a rocket launch  as the vehicle speed increases  and the atmosphere thins  there is a point of maximum aerodynamic drag called Max Q  This determines the minimum aerodynamic strength of the vehicle  as the rocket must avoid buckling under these forces  97   edit  Energy  edit  Energy efficiency Main article  propulsive efficiency Rocket launch vehicles take off with a great deal of flames  noise and drama  and it might seem obvious that they are grievously inefficient  However  while they are far from perfect  their energy efficiency is not as bad as might be supposed  The energy density of a typical rocket propellant is often around one third that of conventional hydrocarbon fuels  the bulk of the mass is  often relatively inexpensive  oxidizer  Nevertheless  at take off the rocket has a great deal of energy in the fuel and oxidizer stored within the vehicle  It is of course desirable that as much of the energy of the propellant end up as kinetic or potential energy of the body of the rocket as possible  Energy from the fuel is lost in air drag and gravity drag and is used for the rocket to gain altitude and speed  However  much of the lost energy ends up in the exhaust  114  In a chemical propulsion device  the engine efficiency is simply the ratio of the kinetic power of the exhaust gases and the power available from the chemical reaction  114  100  efficiency within the engine  engine efficiency   would mean that all the heat energy of the combustion products is converted into kinetic energy of the jet  This is not possible  but the near adiabatic high expansion ratio nozzles that can be used with rockets come surprisingly close  when the nozzle expands the gas  the gas is cooled and accelerated  and an energy efficiency of up to 70  can be achieved  Most of the rest is heat energy in the exhaust that is not recovered  114  The high efficiency is a consequence of the fact that rocket combustion can be performed at very high temperatures and the gas is finally released at much lower temperatures  and so giving good Carnot efficiency  However  engine efficiency is not the whole story  In common with the other jet based engines  but particularly in rockets due to their high and typically fixed exhaust speeds  rocket vehicles are extremely inefficient at low speeds irrespective of the engine efficiency  The problem is that at low speeds  the exhaust carries away a huge amount of kinetic energy rearward  This phenomenon is termed propulsive efficiency     114  However  as speeds rise  the resultant exhaust speed goes down  and the overall vehicle energetic efficiency rises  reaching a peak of around 100  of the engine efficiency when the vehicle is travelling exactly at the same speed that the exhaust is emitted  In this case the exhaust would ideally stop dead in space behind the moving vehicle  taking away zero energy  and from conservation of energy  all the energy would end up in the vehicle  The efficiency then drops off again at even higher speeds as the exhaust ends up travelling forwards  trailing behind the vehicle  Rocket propulsive efficiency as a function of vehicle speed divided by effective exhaust speed From these principles it can be shown that the propulsive efficiency for a rocket moving at speed with an exhaust velocity is   114  And the overall energy efficiency is  For example  from the equation  with an of 0 7  a rocket flying at Mach 0 85  which most aircraft cruise at  with an exhaust velocity of Mach 10  would have a predicted overall energy efficiency of 5 9   whereas a conventional  modern  air breathing jet engine achieves closer to 35  efficiency  Thus a rocket would need about 6x more energy  and allowing for the specific energy of rocket propellant being around one third that of conventional air fuel  roughly 18x more mass of propellant would need to be carried for the same journey  This is why rockets are rarely if ever used for general aviation  Since the energy ultimately comes from fuel  these considerations mean that rockets are mainly useful when a very high speed is required  such as ICBMs or orbital launch  For example NASA s space shuttle fires its engines for around 8 5 minutes  consuming 1 000 tonnes of solid propellant  containing 16  aluminium  and an additional 2 000 000 litres of liquid propellant  106 261 kg of liquid hydrogen fuel  to lift the 100 000 kg vehicle  including the 25 000 kg payload  to an altitude of 111 km and an orbital velocity of 30 000 km h  At this altitude and velocity  the vehicle has a kinetic energy of about 3 TJ and a potential energy of roughly 200 GJ  Given the initial energy of 20 TJ  nb 5  the Space Shuttle is about 16  energy efficient at launching the orbiter  Thus jet engines which have a better match between speed and jet exhaust speed such as turbofans  in spite of their worse   dominate for subsonic and supersonic atmospheric use while rockets work best at hypersonic speeds  On the other hand rockets do also see many short range relatively low speed military applications where their low speed inefficiency is outweighed by their extremely high thrust and hence high accelerations   edit  Oberth effect Main article  Oberth effect One subtle feature of rockets relates to energy  A rocket stage  while carrying a given load  is capable of giving a particular delta v  This delta v means that the speed will increase  or decrease  by a particular amount  which is independent of the initial speed  However  because kinetic energy is a square law on speed  this means that the faster the rocket is travelling before the burn the more orbital energy it gains or loses  This fact is used in interplanetary travel  It means that the amount of delta v to reach other planets  over and above that to reach escape velocity can be much less if the delta v is applied when the rocket is travelling at high speeds  close to the Earth or other planetary surface  whereas waiting till the rocket has slowed at altitude multiplies up the effort required to achieve the desired trajectory   edit  Safety  reliability and accidents Space Shuttle Challenger was torn apart 73 seconds after launch after hot gases escaped the SRBs  causing the breakup of the Shuttle stack See also  List of spaceflight related accidents and incidents The reliability of rockets  as for all physical systems  is dependent on the quality of engineering design and construction  Because of the enormous chemical energy in rocket propellants  greater energy by weight than explosives  but lower than gasoline   consequences of accidents can be severe  Most space missions have some issues  115  In 1986  following the Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster  American Physicist Richard Feynmann  having served on the Rogers Commission estimated that the chance of an unsafe condition for a launch of the Shuttle was very roughly 1   116  more recently the historical per person flight risk in orbital spaceflight has been calculated to be around 2  117  or 4   118   edit  Costs and economics The costs of rockets can be roughly divided into propellant costs  the costs of obtaining and or producing the  dry mass  of the rocket and the costs of any required support equipment and facilities  119  Most of the takeoff mass of a rocket is normally propellant  However propellant is seldom more than a few times more expensive than gasoline per kg  as of 2009 gasoline is about  1 kg or less   and although substantial amounts are needed  for all but the very cheapest rockets it turns out that the propellant costs are usually comparatively small  although not completely negligible  119  With liquid oxygen costing  0 15 per kilogram and liquid hydrogen  2 20 per kilogram  the Space Shuttle has a liquid propellant expense of approximately  1 4 million for each launch that costs  450 million from other expenses  with 40  of the mass of propellants used by it being liquids in the external fuel tank  60  solids in the SRBs   120  121  122  Even though a rocket s non propellant  dry mass is often only between 1 5th and 1 20th of total mass  123  nevertheless this cost dominates  For hardware with the performance used in orbital launch vehicles  expenses of  2000  10 000  per kilogram of dry weight are common  primarily from engineering  fabrication  and testing  raw materials amount to typically around 2  of total expense  124  125  Extreme performance requirements for rockets reaching orbit correlate with high cost  including intensive quality control to ensure reliability despite the limited safety factors allowable for weight reasons  125  Components produced in small numbers if not individually machined can prevent amortization of R amp D and facility costs over mass production to the degree seen in more pedestrian manufacturing  125  Amongst liquid fueled rockets  complexity can be influenced by how much hardware must be lightweight  like pressure fed engines can have two orders of magnitude lesser part count than pump fed engines but lead to more weight by needing greater tank pressure  most often used in just small maneuvering thrusters as a consequence  125  To change the preceding factors for orbital launch vehicles  proposed methods have included mass producing simple rockets in large quantities or on large scale  119  or developing reusable rockets meant to fly very frequently to amortize their up front expense over many payloads  or reducing rocket performance requirements by constructing a hypothetical non rocket spacelaunch system for part of the velocity to orbit  or all of it but with most methods involving some rocket use   The costs of support equipment  range costs and launch pads generally scale up with the size of the rocket  but vary less with launch rate  and so may be considered to be approximately a fixed cost  119  Rockets in applications other than launch to orbit  such as military rockets and rocket assisted take off   commonly not needing comparable performance and sometimes mass produced  are often relatively inexpensive   edit  See also Spaceflight portal Lists Timeline of spaceflight
