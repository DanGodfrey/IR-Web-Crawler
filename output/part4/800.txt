Senator from the state of Wisconsin from 1947 until his death in 1957  Beginning in 1950  McCarthy became the most visible public face of a period in which Cold War tensions fueled fears of widespread Communist subversion  1  He was noted for making claims that there were large numbers of Communists and Soviet spies and sympathizers inside the United States federal government and elsewhere  Ultimately  McCarthy s tactics and his inability to substantiate his claims led him to be censured by the United States Senate  The term McCarthyism  coined in 1950 in reference to McCarthy s practices  was soon applied to similar anti communist activities  Today the term is used more generally in reference to demagogic  reckless  and unsubstantiated accusations  as well as public attacks on the character and or patriotism of political opponents  2  Born and raised on a Wisconsin farm  McCarthy earned a law degree at Marquette University in 1935 and was elected as a circuit judge in 1939  the youngest in state history  3  At age 33  McCarthy volunteered for the United States Marine Corps and served during World War II  He successfully ran for the United States Senate in 1946  defeating Robert M  La Follette  Jr  After three largely undistinguished years in the Senate  McCarthy rose suddenly to national fame in February 1950 when he asserted in a speech that he had a list of  members of the Communist Party and members of a spy ring  who were employed in the State Department  4  McCarthy was never able to prove his sensational charge  In succeeding years  McCarthy made additional accusations of Communist infiltration into the State Department  the administration of President Harry S  Truman  Voice of America  and the United States Army  He also used charges of communism  communist sympathies  or disloyalty to attack a number of politicians and other individuals inside and outside of government  With the highly publicized Army McCarthy hearings of 1954  McCarthy s support and popularity began to fade  On December 2  1954  the Senate voted to censure Senator McCarthy by a vote of 67 to 22  making him one of the few senators ever to be disciplined in this fashion  McCarthy died in Bethesda Naval Hospital on May 2  1957  at the age of 48  The official cause of death was acute hepatitis  it is widely accepted that this was caused  or at least exacerbated  by alcoholism  5  Contents 1 Early life and career 1 1 Military service 1 2 Senate campaign 2 United States Senate 2 1 Wheeling speech 2 2 Tydings Committee 2 3 Fame  notoriety  and

Grand Chute  Wisconsin  near Appleton  the fifth of seven children  6  7  His mother  Bridget Tierney  was from County Tipperary  Ireland  His father  Timothy McCarthy  was born in the United States  the son of an Irish father and a German mother  McCarthy dropped out of junior high school at age 14 to help his parents manage their farm  He entered Little Wolf High School  in Manawa  Wisconsin  when he was 20 and graduated in one year  8  McCarthy worked his way through college  from 1930 to 1935  studying first engineering  then law  and eventually earning a law degree at Marquette University in Milwaukee  9  He was admitted to the bar in 1935  While working in a law firm in Shawano  Wisconsin  he launched an unsuccessful campaign to become district attorney as a Democrat in 1936  In 1939  McCarthy had better success  he successfully vied for the elected post of the non partisan 10th District circuit judge  10  11  During his years as an attorney  McCarthy made money on the side by gambling  12  McCarthy s judicial career attracted some controversy due to the speed with which he dispatched many of his cases  He had inherited a docket with a heavy backlog and he worked constantly to clear it  At times he compensated for his lack of experience by demanding  and relying heavily upon  precise briefs from the contesting attorneys  The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed a relatively low percentage of the cases he heard  13   edit  Military service Joseph McCarthy in his U S  Marine Corps uniform In 1942  shortly after the U S  entered World War II  McCarthy was commissioned into the United States Marine Corps  despite the fact that his judicial office exempted him from compulsory service  His education qualified him for an automatic commission as an officer  and he became a second lieutenant after completing basic training  He served as an intelligence briefing officer for a dive bomber squadron in the Solomon Islands and Bougainville  McCarthy reportedly chose the Marines with the hope that being a veteran of this branch of the military would serve him best in his future political career  14  He would leave the Marines with the rank of captain  It is well documented that McCarthy lied about his war record  Despite his automatic commission  he claimed to have enlisted as a  buck private   He flew twelve combat missions as a gunner observer  earning the nickname of  Tail Gunner Joe  in the course of one of these missions  15  He later claimed 32 missions in order to qualify for a Distinguished Flying Cross  which he received in 1952  McCarthy publicized a letter of commendation which he claimed had been signed by his commanding officer and countersigned by Admiral Chester W  Nimitz  then Chief of Naval Operations  However  it was revealed that McCarthy had written this letter himself  in his capacity as intelligence officer  A  war wound  that McCarthy made the subject of varying stories involving airplane crashes or antiaircraft fire was in fact received aboard ship during a ceremony for sailors crossing the equator for the first time  14  16  McCarthy campaigned for the Republican Senate nomination in Wisconsin while still on active duty in 1944 but was defeated for the GOP nomination by Alexander Wiley  the incumbent  He resigned his commission in April 1945  five months before the end of the Pacific war in September 1945  He was then reelected unopposed to his circuit court position  and began a much more systematic campaign for the 1946 Republican Senate primary nomination  In this race  he was challenging three term senator and Wisconsin Progressive Party icon Robert M  La Follette  Jr   edit  Senate campaign In his campaign  McCarthy attacked La Follette for not enlisting during the war  although La Follette had been 46 when Pearl Harbor was bombed  He also claimed La Follette had made huge profits from his investments while he  McCarthy  had been away fighting for his country  In fact  McCarthy had invested in the stock market himself during the war  netting a profit of  42 000 in 1943  La Follette s investments consisted of partial interest in a radio station  which earned him a profit of  47 000 over two years  17  The suggestion that La Follette had been guilty of war profiteering was deeply damaging  and McCarthy won the primary nomination 207 935 votes to 202 557  It was during this campaign that McCarthy started publicizing his war time nickname  Tail Gunner Joe   using the slogan   Congress needs a tail gunner   Arnold Beichman later stated that McCarthy  was elected to his first term in the Senate with support from the Communist controlled United Electrical  Radio and Machine Workers  CIO   which preferred McCarthy to the anti communist Robert M  La Follette  18  In the general election against Democratic opponent Howard J  McMurray  McCarthy won 61 2  to Democrat McMurray s 37 3   and thus joined Senator Wiley  whom he had challenged unsuccessfully two years earlier  in the Senate  Wisconsin U S  Senate Election  1946 Party Candidate Votes Percentage Republican Joseph McCarthy 620 430 61 2  Democratic Howard McMurray 378 772 37 3   edit  United States Senate McCarthy s first three years in the Senate were unremarkable  McCarthy was a popular speaker  invited by many different organizations  covering a wide range of topics  His aides and many in the Washington social circle described him as charming and friendly  and he was a popular guest at cocktail parties  He was far less well liked among fellow senators  however  who found him quick tempered and prone to impatience and even rage  Outside of a small circle of colleagues  he was soon an isolated figure in the Senate  19  He was active in labor management issues  with a reputation as a moderate Republican  He fought against continuation of wartime price controls  especially on sugar  His advocacy in this area was associated by critics with a  20 000 personal loan McCarthy received from a Pepsi bottling executive  earning the Senator the derisive nickname  The Pepsi Cola Kid   20  He supported the Taft Hartley Act over Truman s veto  angering labor unions in Wisconsin but solidifying his business base  21  In an incident for which he would be widely criticized  McCarthy lobbied for the commutation of death sentences given to a group of Waffen SS soldiers convicted of war crimes for carrying out the 1944 Malmedy massacre of American prisoners of war  McCarthy was critical of the convictions because of allegations of torture during the interrogations that led to the German soldiers  confessions  He charged that the U S  Army was engaged in a coverup of judicial misconduct  but never presented any evidence to support the accusation  22  Shortly after this  a poll of the Senate press corps voted McCarthy  the worst U S  senator  currently in office  23   edit  Wheeling speech McCarthy experienced a meteoric rise in national profile on February 9  1950  when he gave a Lincoln Day speech to the Republican Women s Club of Wheeling  West Virginia  His words in the speech are a matter of some debate  as no audio recording was saved  However  it is generally agreed that he produced a piece of paper that he claimed contained a list of known Communists working for the State Department  McCarthy is usually quoted to have said   The State Department is infested with communists  I have here in my hand a list of 205 a list of names that were made known to the Secretary of State as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the State Department   24  25  There is some dispute about whether or not McCarthy actually gave the number of people on the list as being  205  or  57   In a later telegram to President Truman  and when entering the speech into the Congressional Record  he used the number 57  26  The origin of the number 205 can be traced  In later debates on the Senate floor  McCarthy referred to a 1946 letter that then Secretary of State James Byrnes sent to Congressman Adolph J  Sabath  In that letter  Byrnes said State Department security investigations had resulted in  recommendation against permanent employment  for 284 persons  and that 79 of these had been removed from their jobs  this left 205 still on the State Department s payroll  In fact  by the time of McCarthy s speech only about 65 of the employees mentioned in the Byrnes letter were still with the State Department  and all of these had undergone further security checks  27  At the time of McCarthy s speech  communism was a growing concern in the United States  This concern was exacerbated by the actions of the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe  the fall of China to the communists  the Soviets  development of the atomic bomb the year before  and by the contemporary controversy surrounding Alger Hiss and the confession of Soviet spy Klaus Fuchs  With this background and due to the sensational nature of McCarthy s charge against the State Department  the Wheeling speech soon attracted a flood of press interest in McCarthy   edit  Tydings Committee McCarthy himself was taken aback by the massive media response to the Wheeling speech  and he was accused of continually revising both his charges and his figures  In Salt Lake City  Utah  a few days later  he cited a figure of 57  and in the Senate on February 20  he claimed 81   During a five hour speech  28  McCarthy presented a case by case analysis of his 81  loyalty risks  employed at the State Department  It is widely accepted that most of McCarthy s cases were selected from the so called  Lee list   a report that had been compiled three years earlier for the House Appropriations Committee  Led by a former FBI agent named Robert E  Lee  the House investigators had reviewed security clearance documents on State Department employees  and had determined that there were  incidents of inefficiencies  29  in the security reviews of 108 employees  McCarthy hid the source of his list  stating that he had penetrated the  iron curtain  of State Department secrecy with the aid of  some good  loyal Americans in the State Department   30  In reciting the information from the Lee list cases  McCarthy consistently exaggerated  representing the hearsay of witnesses as facts and converting phrases such as  inclined towards Communism  to  a Communist   31  Senator Millard Tydings In response to McCarthy s charges  the Tydings Committee hearings were called  This was a subcommittee of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations set up in February 1950 to conduct  a full and complete study and investigation as to whether persons who are disloyal to the United States are  or have been  employed by the Department of State   32  Many Democratic Party politicians were incensed at McCarthy s attack on the State Department of a Democratic administration  and had hoped to use the hearings to discredit him  The Democratic chairman of the subcommittee  Senator Millard Tydings  was reported to have said   Let me have him  McCarthy  for three days in public hearings  and he ll never show his face in the Senate again   33  During the hearings  McCarthy moved on from his original unnamed Lee list cases and used the hearings to make charges against nine specific people  Dorothy Kenyon  Esther Brunauer  Haldore Hanson  Gustavo Dur n  Owen Lattimore  Harlow Shapley  Frederick Schuman  John S  Service  and Philip Jessup  Some of them no longer worked for the State Department  or never had  all had previously been the subject of charges of varying worth and validity  Owen Lattimore became a particular focus of McCarthy s  who at one point described him as a  top Russian spy   Throughout the hearings  McCarthy employed colorful rhetoric  but produced no substantial evidence  to support his accusations  citation needed  From its beginning  the Tydings Committee was marked by partisan infighting  Its final report  written by the Democratic majority  concluded that the individuals on McCarthy s list were neither Communists nor pro communist  and said the State Department had an effective security program  The Tydings Report labeled McCarthy s charges a  fraud and a hoax   and said that the result of McCarthy s actions was to  confuse and divide the American people       to a degree far beyond the hopes of the Communists themselves   Republicans responded in kind  with William E  Jenner stating that Tydings was guilty of  the most brazen whitewash of treasonable conspiracy in our history   34  The full Senate voted three times on whether to accept the report  and each time the voting was precisely divided along party lines  35   edit  Fame  notoriety  and personal life From 1950 onward  McCarthy continued to exploit the fear of Communism and to press his accusations that the government was failing to deal with Communism within its ranks  These accusations received wide publicity  increased his approval rating  and gained him a powerful national following  Herbert Block  who signed his work  Herblock   coined the term  McCarthyism  in this cartoon in the March 29  1950 Washington Post  McCarthy s methods also brought on the disapproval and opposition of many  Barely a month after McCarthy s Wheeling speech  the term  McCarthyism  was coined by Washington Post cartoonist Herbert Block  Block and others used the word as a synonym for demagoguery  baseless defamation  and mudslinging  Later  it would be embraced by McCarthy and some of his supporters   McCarthyism is Americanism with its sleeves rolled   McCarthy said in a 1952 speech  and later that year he published a book titled McCarthyism  The Fight For America  McCarthy has been accused of attempting to discredit his critics and political opponents by accusing them of being Communists or communist sympathizers  In the 1950 Maryland Senate election  McCarthy campaigned for John Marshall Butler in his race against four term incumbent Millard Tydings  with whom McCarthy had been in conflict during the Tydings Committee hearings  In speeches supporting Butler  McCarthy accused Tydings of  protecting Communists  and  shielding traitors   McCarthy s staff was heavily involved in the campaign  and collaborated in the production of a campaign tabloid that contained a composite photograph doctored to make it appear that Tydings was in intimate conversation with Communist leader Earl Russell Browder  36  37  38  A Senate subcommittee later investigated this election and referred to it as  a despicable  back street type of campaign   as well as recommending that the use of defamatory literature in a campaign be made grounds for expulsion from the Senate  39  In addition to the Tydings Butler race  McCarthy campaigned for several other Republicans in the 1950 elections  including that of Everett Dirksen against Democratic incumbent and Senate Majority Leader Scott W  Lucas  Dirksen  and indeed all the candidates McCarthy supported  won their elections  and those he opposed lost  The elections  including many that McCarthy was not involved in  were an overall Republican sweep  Although his impact on the elections was unclear  McCarthy was credited as a key Republican campaigner  He was now regarded as one of the most powerful men in the Senate and was treated with new found deference by his colleagues  40  In the 1952 Senate elections McCarthy was returned to his Senate seat with 54 2  of the vote  compared to Democrat Thomas Fairchild s 45 6   Wisconsin U S  Senate Election  1952 Party Candidate Votes Percentage Republican Joseph McCarthy 870 444 54 2  Democratic Thomas E  Fairchild 731 402 45 6  In 1950 McCarthy assaulted journalist Drew Pearson in the cloakroom of a Washington club  reportedly kneeing him in the groin  McCarthy  who admitted the assault  claimed he merely  slapped  Pearson  41  In 1952  using rumors collected by Pearson  Nevada publisher Hank Greenspun wrote that McCarthy was a homosexual  The major journalistic media refused to print the story  and no notable McCarthy biographer has accepted the rumor as probable  42  In 1953  McCarthy married Jean Kerr  a researcher in his office  He and his wife adopted a baby girl  whom they named Tierney Elizabeth McCarthy  in January 1957   edit  McCarthy and the Truman administration McCarthy and President Truman clashed often during the years both held office  McCarthy characterized Truman and the Democratic Party as soft on  or even in league with  Communists  and spoke of the Democrats   twenty years of treason   Truman  in turn  once referred to McCarthy as  the best asset the Kremlin has   calling McCarthy s actions an attempt to  sabotage the foreign policy of the United States  in a cold war and comparing it to shooting American soldiers in the back in a hot war  43  It was the Truman Administration s State Department that McCarthy accused of harboring 205  or 57 or 81   known Communists   Truman s Secretary of Defense George Catlett Marshall was the target of some of McCarthy s most vitriolic rhetoric  Marshall had been Army Chief of Staff during World War II and was also Truman s former Secretary of State  Marshall was a highly respected General and statesman  remembered today as both the architect of victory and the architect of peace  the latter based on the Marshall Plan for post war reconstruction of Europe  for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953  McCarthy made a lengthy speech on Marshall  later published in 1951 as a book titled America s Retreat From Victory  The Story Of George Catlett Marshall  Marshall had been involved in American foreign policy with China  and McCarthy charged that Marshall was directly responsible for the loss of China to Communism  In the speech McCarthy also implied that Marshall was guilty of treason  44  declared that  if Marshall were merely stupid  the laws of probability would dictate that part of his decisions would serve this country s interest   44  and most famously  accused him of being part of  a conspiracy so immense and an infamy so black as to dwarf any previous venture in the history of man   44  During the Korean War  when President Truman dismissed General Douglas MacArthur  McCarthy charged that Truman and his advisors must have planned the dismissal during late night sessions when  they ve had time to get the President cheerful  on Bourbon and Benedictine  McCarthy declared   The son of a bitch should be impeached   45   edit  Support from Catholics and Kennedy family One of the strongest bases of anti Communist sentiment in the United States was the Catholic community  which constituted over 20  of the national vote  McCarthy identified himself as Catholic  and although the great majority of Catholics were Democrats  as his fame as a leading anti Communist grew  he became popular in Catholic communities across the country  with strong support from many leading Catholics  diocesan newspapers  and Catholic journals  46  At the same time  some Catholics did oppose McCarthy  notably the anti Communist author Father John Francis Cronin and the influential journal Commonweal  47  McCarthy established a bond with the powerful Kennedy family  which had high visibility among Catholics  McCarthy became a close friend of Joseph P  Kennedy  Sr   himself a fervent anti Communist  and was a frequent guest at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port  He dated two of Kennedy s daughters  Patricia and Eunice  48  49  and was godfather to Robert F  Kennedy s first child  Kathleen Kennedy  Robert was chosen by McCarthy as a counsel for his investigatory committee  but resigned after six months due to disagreements with McCarthy and Cohn  Joseph Kennedy had a national network of contacts and became a vocal supporter  building McCarthy s popularity among Catholics and making sizable contributions to McCarthy s campaigns  50  The Kennedy patriarch hoped that one of his sons would be president  Mindful of the anti Catholic prejudice Al Smith faced during his 1928 campaign for that office  Joseph Kennedy supported McCarthy as a national Catholic politician who might pave the way for a younger Kennedy s presidential candidacy  Unlike many Democrats  John F  Kennedy  who served in the Senate with McCarthy from 1953 until the latter s death in 1957  never attacked McCarthy  McCarthy had refused to campaign for Kennedy s 1952 opponent  Republican incumbent Henry Cabot Lodge  Jr   due to his friendship with the Kennedys  51  When a speaker at a February 1952 final club dinner stated that he was glad McCarthy had not attended Harvard College  an angry Kennedy jumped up  denounced the speaker  and left the event  52  346 Asked by Arthur M  Schlesinger  Jr  why he avoided criticism of McCarthy  Kennedy said   Hell  half my voters in Massachusetts look on McCarthy as a hero   53   edit  McCarthy and Eisenhower Dwight D  Eisenhower  34th President of the United States During the 1952 presidential election  the Eisenhower campaign toured Wisconsin with McCarthy  In a speech delivered in Green Bay  Eisenhower declared that while he agreed with McCarthy s goals  he disagreed with his methods  In draft versions of his speech  Eisenhower had also included a strong defense of his mentor  George Marshall  which was a direct rebuke of McCarthy s frequent attacks  However  under the advice of conservative colleagues who were fearful that Eisenhower could lose Wisconsin if he alienated McCarthy supporters  he deleted this defense from later versions of his speech  54  55  The deletion was discovered by a reporter for The New York Times and featured on their front page the next day  Eisenhower was widely criticized for giving up his personal convictions  and the incident became the low point of his campaign  54  With his victory in the 1952 presidential race  Dwight Eisenhower became the first Republican president in 20 years  The Republican party also held a majority in the House of Representatives and the Senate  After being elected president  Eisenhower made it clear to those close to him that he did not approve of McCarthy and he worked actively to diminish his power and influence  Still  he never directly confronted McCarthy or criticized him by name in any speech  thus perhaps prolonging McCarthy s power by giving the impression that even the President was afraid to criticize him directly  Oshinsky disputes this  stating that  Eisenhower was known as a harmonizer  a man who could get diverse factions to work toward a common goal     Leadership  he explained  meant patience and conciliation  not  hitting people over the head    56  McCarthy won reelection in 1952 with 54  of the vote  defeating former Wisconsin State Attorney General Thomas E  Fairchild but badly trailing a Republican ticket which swept the state of Wisconsin  all the other Republican winners  including Eisenhower himself  received at least 60  of the Wisconsin vote  57  Those who expected that party loyalty would cause McCarthy to tone down his accusations of Communists being harbored within the government were soon disappointed  Eisenhower had never been an admirer of McCarthy  and their relationship became more hostile once Eisenhower was in office  In a November 1953 speech that was carried on national television  McCarthy began by praising the Eisenhower Administration for removing  1 456 Truman holdovers who were     gotten rid of because of Communist connections and activities or perversion   He then went on to complain that John Paton Davies  Jr  was still  on the payroll after eleven months of the Eisenhower Administration   even though Davies had actually been dismissed three weeks earlier  and repeated an unsubstantiated accusation that Davies had tried to  put Communists and espionage agents in key spots in the Central Intelligence Agency   In the same speech  he criticized Eisenhower for not doing enough to secure the release of missing American pilots shot down over China during the Korean War  58  By the end of 1953  McCarthy had altered the  twenty years of treason  catchphrase he had coined for the preceding Democratic administrations and began referring to  twenty one years of treason  to include Eisenhower s first year in office  59  As McCarthy became increasingly combative towards the Eisenhower Administration  Eisenhower faced repeated calls that he confront McCarthy directly  Eisenhower refused  saying privately  nothing would please him  McCarthy  more than to get the publicity that would be generated by a public repudiation by the President   60  On several occasions Eisenhower is reported to have said of McCarthy that he did not want to  get down in the gutter with that guy   61   edit  Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations With the beginning of his second term as senator in 1953  McCarthy was made chairman of the Senate Committee on Government Operations  According to some reports  Republican leaders were growing wary of McCarthy s methods and gave him this relatively mundane panel rather than the Internal Security Subcommittee the committee normally involved with investigating Communists thus putting McCarthy  where he can t do any harm   in the words of Senate Majority Leader Robert Taft  62  However  the Committee on Government Operations included the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  and the mandate of this subcommittee was sufficiently flexible to allow McCarthy to use it for his own investigations of Communists in the government  McCarthy appointed Roy Cohn as chief counsel and 27 year old Robert F  Kennedy as an assistant counsel to the subcommittee  This subcommittee would be the scene of some of McCarthy s most publicized exploits  When the records of the closed executive sessions of the subcommittee under McCarthy s chairmanship were made public in 2003 4  63  Senators Susan Collins and Carl Levin wrote the following in their preface to the documents  Senator McCarthy s zeal to uncover subversion and espionage led to disturbing excesses  His browbeating tactics destroyed careers of people who were not involved in the infiltration of our government  His freewheeling style caused both the Senate and the Subcommittee to revise the rules governing future investigations  and prompted the courts to act to protect the Constitutional rights of witnesses at Congressional hearings     These hearings are a part of our national past that we can neither afford to forget nor permit to reoccur  64  The subcommittee first investigated allegations of Communist influence in the Voice of America  VOA   at that time administered by the State Department s United States Information Agency  Many VOA personnel were questioned in front of television cameras and a packed press gallery  with McCarthy lacing his questions with hostile innuendo and false accusations  65  A few VOA employees alleged Communist influence on the content of broadcasts  but none of the charges were substantiated  Morale at VOA was badly damaged  and one of its engineers committed suicide during McCarthy s investigation  Ed Kretzman  a policy advisor for the service  would later comment that it was VOA s  darkest hour when Senator McCarthy and his chief hatchet man  Roy Cohn  almost succeeded in muffling it   65  The subcommittee then turned to the overseas library program of the International Information Agency  Cohn toured Europe examining the card catalogs of the State Department libraries looking for works by authors he deemed inappropriate  McCarthy then recited the list of supposedly pro communist authors before his subcommittee and the press  The State Department bowed to McCarthy and ordered its overseas librarians to remove from their shelves  material by any controversial persons  Communists  fellow travelers  etc   Some libraries actually burned the newly forbidden books  66  Shortly after this  in one of his carefully oblique public criticisms of McCarthy  President Eisenhower urged Americans   Don t join the book burners     Don t be afraid to go in your library and read every book   67  Soon after receiving the chair to the Subcommittee on Investigations  McCarthy appointed Joseph Brown Matthews  generally known as J  B  Matthews  as staff director of the subcommittee  One of the nation s foremost anti communists  Matthews had formerly been staff director for the House Un American Activities Committee  The appointment became controversial when it was learned that Matthews had recently written an article titled  Reds And Our Churches   68  which opened with the sentence   The largest single group supporting the Communist apparatus in the United States is composed of Protestant Clergymen   A group of senators denounced this  shocking and unwarranted attack against the American clergy  and demanded that McCarthy dismiss Matthews  McCarthy at first refused to do this  But as the controversy mounted  and the majority of his own subcommittee joined the call for Matthews  ouster  McCarthy finally yielded and accepted his resignation  For some McCarthy opponents  this was a signal defeat of the senator  showing he was not as invincible as he had formerly seemed  69   edit  Investigating the Army In autumn 1953  McCarthy s committee began its ill fated inquiry into the United States Army  This began with McCarthy opening an investigation into the Army Signal Corps laboratory at Fort Monmouth  McCarthy  newly married to Jean Kerr  cut short his honeymoon to open the investigation  He garnered some headlines with stories of a dangerous spy ring among the Army researchers  but after weeks of hearings  nothing came of his investigations  70  Unable to expose any signs of subversion  McCarthy focused instead on the case of Irving Peress  a New York dentist who had been drafted into the Army in 1952 and promoted to major in November 1953  Shortly thereafter it came to the attention of the military bureaucracy that Peress  who was a member of the left wing American Labor Party  had declined to answer questions about his political affiliations on a loyalty review form  Peress  superiors were therefore ordered to discharge him from the Army within 90 days  McCarthy subpoenaed Peress to appear before his subcommittee on January 30  1954  Peress refused to answer McCarthy s questions  citing his rights under the Fifth Amendment  McCarthy responded by sending a message to Secretary of the Army  Robert Stevens  demanding that Peress be court martialed  On that same day  Peress asked for his pending discharge from the Army to be effected immediately  and the next day Brigadier General Ralph W  Zwicker  his commanding officer at Camp Kilmer in New Jersey  gave him an honorable separation from the Army  At McCarthy s encouragement   Who promoted Peress   became a rallying cry among many anti communists and McCarthy supporters  In fact  and as McCarthy knew  Peress had been promoted automatically through the provisions of the Doctor Draft Law  for which McCarthy had voted  71  McCarthy summoned General Zwicker to his subcommittee on February 18  Zwicker  on advice from Army counsel  refused to answer some of McCarthy s questions and reportedly changed his story three times when asked if he had known at the time he signed the discharge that Peress had refused to answer questions before the McCarthy subcommittee  McCarthy compared Zwicker s intelligence to that of a  five year old child   and said he was  not fit to wear that uniform   72  This abuse of Zwicker  a battlefield hero of World War II  caused considerable outrage among the military  newspapers  civilian veterans  senators of both parties and  probably most dangerously for McCarthy  President Eisenhower himself  73  Army Secretary Stevens ordered Zwicker not to return to McCarthy s hearing for further questioning  Hoping to mend the increasingly hostile relations between McCarthy and the Army  a group of Republicans  including McCarthy  met with Secretary Stevens over a luncheon that included fried chicken and convinced him to sign a  memorandum of understanding  in which he capitulated to most of McCarthy s demands  After  The Chicken Luncheon   as it came to be called  McCarthy later told a reporter that Stevens  could not have given in more abjectly if he had got down on his knees   74  Reaction to this agreement was widely negative  Secretary Stevens was ridiculed by Pentagon officers  73  and The Times of London wrote   Senator McCarthy achieved today what General Burgoyne and General Cornwallis never achieved the surrender of the American Army   74  A few months later  the Army  with advice and support from the Eisenhower Administration  would launch a counterattack against McCarthy  It would do this not by directly challenging and criticizing McCarthy s behavior toward Army personnel  but by bringing charges against him on an unrelated issue   edit  Army McCarthy hearings Main article  Army McCarthy hearings Early in 1954  the U S  Army accused McCarthy and his chief counsel  Roy Cohn  of improperly pressuring the Army to give favorable treatment to G  David Schine  a former aide to McCarthy and a friend of Cohn s  who was then serving in the Army as a private  75  McCarthy claimed that the accusation was made in bad faith  in retaliation for his questioning of Zwicker the previous year  The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  usually chaired by McCarthy himself  was given the task of adjudicating these conflicting charges  Republican Senator Karl Mundt was appointed to chair the committee  and the Army McCarthy hearings convened on April 22  1954  McCarthy chats with Roy Cohn  right  at the Army McCarthy hearings  The hearings lasted for 36 days and were broadcast on live television by ABC and DuMont  with an estimated 20 million viewers  After hearing 32 witnesses and two million words of testimony  the committee concluded that McCarthy himself had not exercised any improper influence on Schine s behalf  but that Cohn had engaged in  unduly persistent or aggressive efforts   The committee also concluded that Army Secretary Robert Stevens and Army Counsel John Adams  made efforts to terminate or influence the investigation and hearings at Fort Monmouth   and that Adams  made vigorous and diligent efforts  to block subpoenas for members of the Army Loyalty and Screening Board  by means of personal appeal to certain members of the  McCarthy  committee   Of far greater importance to McCarthy than the committee s inconclusive final report was the negative effect that the extensive exposure had on his popularity  Many in the audience saw him as bullying  reckless  and dishonest  and the daily newspaper summaries of the hearings were also frequently unfavorable  76  77  Late in the hearings  Senator Stuart Symington made an angry and prophetic remark to McCarthy   The American people have had a look at you for six weeks   he said   You are not fooling anyone   78  In Gallup polls of January 1954  50  of those polled had a positive opinion of McCarthy  In June  that number had fallen to 34   In the same polls  those with a negative opinion of McCarthy increased from 29  to 45   73  An increasing number of Republicans and conservatives were coming to see McCarthy as a liability to the party and to anti communism  Congressman George H  Bender noted   There is a growing impatience with the Republican Party  McCarthyism has become a synonym for witch hunting  Star Chamber methods  and the denial of     civil liberties   79  Frederick Woltman  a reporter with a long standing reputation as a staunch anti communist  wrote a five part series of articles criticizing McCarthy in the New York World Telegram  He stated that McCarthy  has become a major liability to the cause of anti communism   and accused him of  wild twisting of facts and near facts  that  repels authorities in the field   80  81  The most famous incident in the hearings was an exchange between McCarthy and the army s chief legal representative  Joseph Nye Welch  On June 9  the 30th day of the hearings  Welch challenged Roy Cohn to provide U S  Attorney General Herbert Brownell  Jr  with McCarthy s list of 130 Communists or subversives in defense plants  before the sun goes down   McCarthy stepped in and said that if Welch was so concerned about persons aiding the Communist Party  he should check on a man in his Boston law office named Fred Fisher  who had once belonged to the National Lawyers Guild  which Brownell had called  the legal mouthpiece of the Communist Party   82  In an impassioned defense of Fisher that some have suggested he had prepared in advance and had hoped not to have to make  83  Welch responded   Until this moment  Senator  I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness      When McCarthy resumed his attack  Welch interrupted him   Let us not assassinate this lad further  Senator  You ve done enough  Have you no sense of decency  sir  at long last  Have you left no sense of decency   When McCarthy once again persisted  Welch cut him off and demanded the chairman  call the next witness   At that point  the gallery erupted in applause and a recess was called  84   edit  Edward R  Murrow  See It Now Edward R  Murrow  pioneer in broadcast journalism One of the most prominent attacks on McCarthy s methods was an episode of the television documentary series See It Now  hosted by journalist Edward R  Murrow  which was broadcast on March 9  1954  Titled  A Report on Senator Joseph R  McCarthy   the episode consisted largely of clips of McCarthy speaking  In these clips  McCarthy accuses the Democratic party of  twenty years of treason   describes the American Civil Liberties Union as  listed as  a front for  and doing the work of   the Communist Party   and berates and harangues various witnesses  including General Zwicker  In his conclusion  Murrow said of McCarthy  His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind  as between the internal and the external threats of Communism  We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty  We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law  We will not walk in fear  one of another  We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason  if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine  and remember that we are not descended from fearful men     We proclaim ourselves  as indeed we are  the defenders of freedom  wherever it continues to exist in the world  but we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home  The actions of the junior Senator from Wisconsin have caused alarm and dismay amongst our allies abroad  and given considerable comfort to our enemies  And whose fault is that  Not really his  He didn t create this situation of fear  he merely exploited it and rather successfully  85  The following week See It Now ran another episode critical of McCarthy  this one focusing on the case of Annie Lee Moss  an African American army clerk who was the target of one of McCarthy s investigations  The Murrow shows  together with the televised Army McCarthy hearings of the same year  were the major causes of a nationwide popular opinion backlash against McCarthy  in part because for the first time his statements were being publicly challenged by noteworthy figures  To counter the negative publicity  McCarthy appeared on See It Now on April 6  1954  and made a number of charges against the popular Murrow  including the accusation that he colluded with the  Russian espionage and propaganda organization  VOKS  86  This response did not go over well with viewers  and the result was a further decline in McCarthy s popularity   edit  Public opinion McCarthy s Support in Gallup

introduced the resolution calling for McCarthy to be censured Several members of the U S  Senate had opposed McCarthy well before 1953  Senator Margaret Chase Smith  a Maine Republican  delivered her  Declaration of Conscience  on June 1  1950  calling for an end to the use of smear tactics without mentioning McCarthy or anyone else by name  Six other Republican Senators   Wayne Morse  Irving Ives  Charles W  Tobey  Edward John Thye  George Aiken  and Robert C  Hendrickson   joined her in condemning McCarthy s tactics  McCarthy referred to Smith and her fellow Senators as  Snow White and the six dwarfs   88  On March 9  1954  Vermont Republican Senator Ralph E  Flanders gave a humor laced speech on the Senate floor  questioning McCarthy s tactics in fighting communism  likening McCarthyism to  housecleaning  with  much clatter and hullabaloo   He recommended that McCarthy turn his attention to the worldwide encroachment of Communism outside North America  89  90  In a June 1 speech  Flanders compared McCarthy to Adolf Hitler  accusing him of spreading  division and confusion  and saying   Were the Junior Senator from Wisconsin in the pay of the Communists he could not have done a better job for them   91  On June 11  Flanders introduced a resolution to have McCarthy removed as chair of his committees  Although there were many in the Senate who believed that some sort of disciplinary action against McCarthy was warranted  there was no clear majority supporting this resolution  Some of the resistance was due to concern about usurping the Senate s rules regarding committee chairs and seniority  Flanders next introduced a resolution to censure McCarthy  The resolution was initially written without any reference to particular actions or misdeeds on McCarthy s part  As Flanders put it   It was not his breaches of etiquette  or of rules or sometimes even of laws which is so disturbing   but rather his overall pattern of behavior  Ultimately a  bill of particulars  listing 46 charges was added to the censure resolution  A special committee  chaired by Senator Arthur Vivian Watkins  was appointed to study and evaluate the resolution  This committee opened hearings on August 31  92  Senator Arthur V  Watkins After two months of hearings and deliberations  the Watkins Committee recommended that McCarthy be censured on two of the 46 counts  his contempt of the Subcommittee on Rules and Administration  which had called him to testify in 1951 and 1952  and his abuse of General Zwicker in 1954  The Zwicker count was dropped by the full Senate on the grounds that McCarthy s conduct was arguably  induced  by Zwicker s own behavior  In place of this count  a new one was drafted regarding McCarthy s statements about the Watkins Committee itself  93  The two counts on which the Senate ultimately voted were  That McCarthy had  failed to cooperate with the Subcommittee on Rules and Administration   and  repeatedly abused the members who were trying to carry out assigned duties      That McCarthy had charged  three members of the  Watkins  Select Committee with  deliberate deception  and  fraud      that the special Senate session     was a  lynch party    and had characterized the committee  as the  unwitting handmaiden    involuntary agent  and  attorneys in fact  of the Communist Party   and had  acted contrary to senatorial ethics and tended to bring the Senate into dishonor and disrepute  to obstruct the constitutional processes of the Senate  and to impair its dignity   94  On December 2  1954  the Senate voted to  condemn  McCarthy on both counts by a vote of 67 to 22  95  The Democrats present unanimously favored condemnation and the Republicans were split evenly  The only senator not on record was John F  Kennedy  who was hospitalized for back surgery  Kennedy never indicated how he would have voted  96  Immediately after the vote  Senator H  Styles Bridges  a McCarthy supporter  argued that the resolution was  not a censure resolution  because the word  condemn  rather than  censure  was used in the final draft  The word  censure  was then removed from the title of the resolution  though it is generally regarded and referred to as a censure of McCarthy  both by historians 97  and in Senate documents  98  McCarthy himself said   I wouldn t exactly call it a vote of confidence   He added   I don t feel I ve been lynched   99   edit  Final years After his censure  McCarthy continued senatorial duties for another two and a half years  but his career as a major public figure had been unmistakably ruined  His colleagues in the Senate avoided him  his speeches on the Senate floor were delivered to a near empty chamber or were received with conspicuous displays of inattention  100  The press that had once recorded his every public statement now ignored him  and outside speaking engagements dwindled almost to nothing  President Eisenhower  free of McCarthy s political intimidation  quipped to his Cabinet that McCarthyism was now  McCarthywasm   101  Still  McCarthy continued to rail against Communism  He warned against attendance at summit conferences with  the Reds   saying that  you cannot offer friendship to tyrants and murderers     without advancing the cause of tyranny and murder   102  He declared that  coexistence with Communists is neither possible nor honorable nor desirable  Our long term objective must be the eradication of Communism from the face of the earth   In one of his final acts in the Senate  McCarthy opposed President Eisenhower s nomination to the Supreme Court of William J  Brennan  after reading a speech Brennan had given shortly beforehand in which he characterized McCarthy s anti Communist investigations as  witch hunts   McCarthy s opposition failed to gain any traction  however  and he was the only Senator to vote against Brennan s confirmation  103  McCarthy s biographers agree that he was a changed man after the censure  declining both physically and emotionally  he became a  pale ghost of his former self  in the words of Fred J  Cook  104  It was reported that McCarthy suffered from cirrhosis of the liver and was frequently hospitalized for alcoholism  Numerous eyewitnesses  including Senate aide George Reedy and journalist Tom Wicker  have reported finding him alarmingly drunk in the Senate  Journalist Richard Rovere  1959  wrote  He had always been a heavy drinker  and there were times in those seasons of discontent when he drank more than ever  But he was not always drunk  He went on the wagon  for him this meant beer instead of whiskey  for days and weeks at a time  The difficulty toward the end was that he couldn t hold the stuff  He went to pieces on his second or third drink  And he did not snap back quickly  105  There are those who observed McCarthy closely including such harsh critics as Jack Anderson and George Reedy who had a different version  The McCarthy they knew early on was a drink nurser  concerned to keep his wits about him and thus gain a competitive edge over others who were imbibing  Although  he may have slid down that path after censure  there are those who knew him well at this period who also deny the image of a chronic drunkard  106   edit  Death Tombstone of Joseph McCarthy with the Fox River in the background McCarthy died in Bethesda Naval Hospital on May 2  1957  at the age of 48  The official cause of his death was listed as acute hepatitis  an inflammation of the liver  It was hinted in the press that he died of alcoholism  an estimation that is now accepted by contemporary biographers  5  He was given a state funeral attended by 70 senators  and a Solemn Pontifical Requiem Mass was said before more than 100 priests and 2 000 others at St  Matthew s Cathedral  Thousands of people viewed the body in Washington  He was buried in St  Mary s Parish Cemetery  Appleton  Wisconsin  where more than 30 000 filed through St  Mary s Church to pay their last respects  107  Three senators George W  Malone  William E  Jenner  and Herman Welker had flown from Washington to Appleton on the plane carrying McCarthy s casket  Robert F  Kennedy quietly attended the funeral in Wisconsin  McCarthy was survived by his wife  Jean  and their adopted daughter  Tierney  In the summer of 1957  a special election was held to fill McCarthy s seat  In the primaries  voters in both parties turned away from McCarthy s legacy  The Republican primary was won by Walter J  Kohler  Jr   who called for a clean break from McCarthy s approach  he defeated former Congressman Glenn Robert Davis  who charged that Eisenhower was soft on Communism  The Democratic winner was William Proxmire  who called the late McCarthy  a disgrace to Wisconsin  to the Senate and to America   On August 27  Proxmire won the election  108   edit  Ongoing debate In the view of a few latter day authors  such as conservative commentators William Norman Grigg 109  and Medford Stanton Evans  110  111  McCarthy s place in history should be reevaluated  Many scholars  including some generally regarded as conservative  have opposed these views  112  113  Other authors and historians  including Arthur Herman  114  assert that new evidence in the form of Venona decrypted Soviet messages  Soviet espionage data now opened to the West  and newly released transcripts of closed hearings before McCarthy s subcommittee has partially vindicated McCarthy by showing that many of his identifications of Communists were correct and that the scale of Soviet espionage activity in the United States during the 1940s and 1950s was larger than many scholars suspected  115  116  After reviewing evidence from Venona and other sources  historian John Earl Haynes concluded that  of 159 people identified on lists used or referenced by McCarthy  evidence was substantial that nine had aided Soviet espionage efforts  He suggested that a majority of those on the lists could legitimately have been considered security risks  but that a substantial minority could not  117  These viewpoints are considered revisionist by many scholars  118  Challenging efforts aimed at the  rehabilitation  of McCarthy  Haynes argues that McCarthy s attempts to  make anti communism a partisan weapon  actually  threatened  the post War  anti Communist consensus   thereby ultimately harming anti Communist efforts more than helping  119 William Bennett  former Reagan Administration Secretary of Education  summed up this perspective in his 2007 book America  The Last Best Hope  The cause of anti communism  which united millions of Americans and which gained the support of Democrats  Republicans and independents  was undermined by Sen  Joe McCarthy     McCarthy addressed a real problem  disloyal elements within the U S  government  But his approach to this real problem was to cause untold grief to the country he claimed to love     Worst of all  McCarthy besmirched the honorable cause of anti communism  He discredited legitimate efforts to counter Soviet subversion of American institutions  120   edit  HUAC McCarthy s hearings are often incorrectly conflated with the hearings of the House Committee on Un American Activities  HUAC   HUAC is best known for the investigation of Alger Hiss and for its investigation of the Hollywood film industry  which led to the blacklisting of hundreds of actors  writers  and directors  HUAC was a House committee  and as such had no formal connection with McCarthy  who served in the Senate   edit  McCarthy in popular culture From the start of his notoriety  McCarthy was a favorite subject for political cartoonists  He was traditionally depicted in a negative light  normally pertaining to McCarthyism and his accusations  Herblock s cartoon that coined the term McCarthyism appeared less than two months after the senator s now famous February 1950 speech in Wheeling  West Virginia  In 1953  the popular daily comic strip Pogo introduced the character Simple J  Malarkey  a pugnacious and conniving wildcat with an unmistakable physical resemblance to McCarthy   After worried newspaper editors protested to the syndicate that provided the strip  creator Walt Kelly henceforth depicted the Malarkey character with a bag of garbage over his head  concealing his features   As his fame grew  McCarthy increasingly became the target of ridicule and parody  He was impersonated by nightclub and radio impressionists and was satirized in Mad magazine  on The Red Skelton Show  and elsewhere  Several comedy songs lampooning the senator were released in 1954  including  Point of Order  by Stan Freberg and Daws Butler   Senator McCarthy Blues  by Hal Block  and unionist folk singer Joe Glazer s  Joe McCarthy s Band   sung to the tune of  McNamara s Band   Also in 1954  the radio comedy team Bob and Ray parodied McCarthy with the character  Commissioner Carstairs  in their soap opera spoof  Mary Backstayge  Noble Wife   That same year  the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio network broadcast a satire  The Investigator  whose title character was a clear imitation of McCarthy  A recording of the show became popular in the United States  and was reportedly played by President Eisenhower at cabinet meetings  121  A more serious fictional portrayal of McCarthy played a central role in the 1959 novel The Manchurian Candidate by Richard Condon  The character of Senator John Iselin  a demagogic anti communist  is closely modeled on McCarthy  even to the varying numbers of Communists he asserts are employed by the federal government  In the 1962 film version  the characterization remains  in this version  a Heinz ketchup bottle inspires Iselin and his wife to settle on  57  as the number of subversives he claims are on the federal payroll  McCarthy was portrayed by Peter Boyle in the 1977 Emmy winning television movie Tail Gunner Joe  a dramatization of McCarthy s life  American band R E M  feature the song  Exhuming McCarthy  on their 1987 album Document  Archival footage of McCarthy himself was used in the 2005 movie Good Night  and Good Luck about Edward R  Murrow
