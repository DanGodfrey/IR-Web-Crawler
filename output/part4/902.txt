New York City  New York  2  and attended the School of Industrial Art high school in Manhattan  3  4  After graduation in 1959  he unsuccessfully attempted to find freelance work at DC Comics  5  and turned then to Archie Comics  where he wanted to work on the publisher s fledgling superhero line  edited by Joe Simon  At the suggestion of staffers  Adams drew  three or four pages of  the superhero  the Fly   but did not receive encouragement from Simon  6  Sympathetic staffers nonetheless asked Adams to draw samples for the Archie teen humor comics themselves  While he did so  Adams said in a 2000s interview  he unknowingly broke into comics  I started to do samples for Archie and I left my Fly samples there  A couple weeks later when I came in to show my Archie samples  I noticed that the pages were still there  but the bottom panel was cut off of one of my pages  I said   What happened   They said   One of the artists did this transition where Tommy Troy turns into the Fly and it s not very good  You did this real nice piece so we ll use that  if it s OK   I said   That s great  That s terrific   6  That panel ran in Adventures of the Fly  4  Jan  1960   6  Afterward  Adams began writing  penciling  inking  and lettering 3  humorous full page and half page gag fillers for Archie s Joke Book Magazine  6  In a 1976 interview  he recalled earning   a bout  16 00 per half page and  32 00 for a full page  That may not seem like a great deal of money  but at the time it meant a great deal to myself as well as my mothers     as we were not in a wealthy state  It was manna from heaven  so to speak   A recommendation led him to artist Howard Nostrand  who was beginning the Bat Masterson syndicated newspaper comic strip  and worked as Nostrand s assistant for three months  primarily drawing backgrounds at what Adams recalled as  9 a week and  a great experience   3  Having  not left Archie Comics under the best of circumstances   3  Adams turned to commercial art for the advertising industry  After a rocky start freelancing  he began landing regular work at the Johnstone and Cushing agency  which specialized in comic book styled advertising  7  Helped by artist Elmer Wexler  who critiqued the young Adams  samples  Adams brought his portfolio to the agency  which initially  didn t believe I had done those particular samples since they looked so much like Elmer Wexler s work  But they gave me a chance and     I stayed there for about a year   8   edit  Ben Casey Premiere of the Ben Casey strip  November 26  1962  Art by Adams  In 1962  Adams began his comics career in earnest at the NEA newspaper syndicated  From a recommendation  writer Jerry Caplin  a k a  Jerry Capp  brother of Li l Abner creator Al Capp  invited Adams to draw samples for Capp s proposed Ben Casey comic strip  based on the popular television medical drama series  6  On the strength of his samples and of his  Chip Martin  College Reporter  AT amp T advertising comic strip pages in Boys  Life magazine  and of his similar Goodyear Tire ads  9  Adams landed the assignment  6  The first daily strip  which carried Adams  signature  appeared November 26  1962  a color Sunday strip was added September 20  1964  10  Adams continued to do Johnston  amp  Cushing assignments during Ben Casey s 3 1 2 year run  11  Comics historian Maurice Horn said the strip  did not shrink from tackling controversial problems  such as heroin addiction  illegitimate pregnancy  and attempted suicide  These were usually treated in soap opera fashion     but there was also a touch of toughness to the proceedings  well rendered by Adams in a forceful  direct style that exuded realism and tension and accorded well with the overall tone of the strip   10  In addition to Capp  Jerry Brondfield also wrote for the strip  with Adams stepping in occasionally  12  The ABC series  which ran five seasons  ended March 21  1966  with the final comic strip appearing Sunday  July 31  1966  10  Despite the end of the series  Adams has said the strip  which he claimed at different points to have appeared in 365 newspapers  8  265 newspapers  13  and 165 newspapers  14  ended  for no other reason that it was an unhappy situation   We ended the strip under mutual agreement  I wasn t happy working on the strip nor was I happy giving up a third of the money to  the TV series  producer   Bing Crosby Productions  The strip I should have been making twelve hundred  dollars  a week from was making me three hundred to three fifty a week  On top of that  I was not able to express myself artistically when I wanted to  But we left under very fine conditions  I was even offered a deal in which I would be paid so much a month if I would agree not to do any syndicated strip for anyone else  in order that I might save myself for anything they have for me to do  8  Adams  goal at this point was to be a commercial illustrator  6  While drawing Ben Casey  he had continued to do storyboards and other work for ad agencies  6  and said in 1976 that after leaving the strip he had shopped around a portfolio for agencies and for men s magazines   but my material was a little too realistic and not exactly right for most  I left my portolio in an advertising agency promising they were going to hold on to it  In the meantime I needed to make some money     and I thought   Why don t I do some comics    15  In a 2000s interview  he remembered the events slightly differently  saying  I took  my portfolio  to various advertising people  I left it at one place overnight and when I came back to get it the next morning it was gone  So six months worth of work down the drain      6  He worked as a ghost artist for a few weeks in 1966 on the comic strip Peter Scratch  1965 1967   a hardboiled detective serial created by writer Elliot Caplin and artist Lou Fine  16  Comics historians also credit Adams with ghosting two weeks of dailies for Stan Drake s The Heart of Juliet Jones  but are uncertain on dates  some sources give 1966  another 1968  and Adams himself 1963  12  As well  Adams drew 18 sample dailies  three weeks  continuity  of a proposed dramatic serial  Tangent  about construction engineer Barnaby Peake  his college student brother Jeff  and their teenaged sibling Chad  in 1965  but it was not syndicated  17  Adams later said that writer Elliot Caplin  brother of Al Capp and Jerry Capp  offered Adams the job of drawing a comic strip based on author Robin Moore s The Green Berets  but that Adams  who opposed the war  suggested longtime DC Comics war comics artist Joe Kubert  who landed that assignment  14   edit  Silver Age splash Strange Adventures  207  Dec  1967   One of Adams  earliest DC Comics covers  and his first for his signature character Deadman  already shows a mature style and a design innovation for the time  It won the 1967 Alley Award for Best Cover  Turning to comic books  Adams found work at Warren Publishing s black and white horror comics magazines  under editor Archie Goodwin  18  Adams debuted there as penciler and inker of writer Goodwin s eight page anthological story  Curse of the Vampire  in Creepy  14  April 1967   He and Goodwin quickly collaborated on two more stories  in Eerie  9  May 1967  and Creepy  15  June 1967   and Adams as well reapproached DC Comics  With DC war comics stalwart Joe Kubert now concentrating on the comic strip The Green Berets  Adams saw an opening  I really didn t like most of the comics  at DC  but I did like war comics      so I thought   You know  now that Joe is not working there  they ve got Russ Heath and they are plugging other people in where Joe used to be  Maybe I could kind of shift into a Joe Kubert kind of thing and do some war comics  and kind of bash them out  quickly        So I went over to see  DC war comics editor  Bob Kanigher and I showed him my stuff  and I did have that feeling that they were missing Joe   a guy who could draw and do that rough  action stuff  So he gave me some work   14  Adams made his DC debut as penciler inker of the 8  page story  It s My Turn to Die   written by Howard Liss  in the anthology series Our Army at War  182  July 1967   He did a smattering of additional horror and war stories  respectively  for the two publishers  and then  after being turned down by DC s Batman editor Julius Schwartz  approached fellow DC editor Murray Boltinoff in the hopes of drawing for Boltinoff s Batman team up title The Brave and the Bold  14  Boltinoff instead assigned him to The Adventures of Jerry Lewis  101  July August 1967  and its full length story  Jerry the Asto Nut   written by Arnold Drake  19  20  It became the first of a slew of stories and covers Adams would draw for that series and The Adventures of Bob Hope  two licensed titles starring fictional versions of the TV  film and nightclub comics  During this period near the end of the industry revival historians call the Silver Age of comic books  Adams was soon assigned his first superhero covers  illustrating that of the Superman flagship Action Comics  356  Nov  1967  and the same month s Superman s Girl Friend  Lois Lane  79  Nov  1967   featuring Superman and a mysterious new costumed character  Titanman  Also that month  Adams drew his first superhero story  teaming with writer Gardner Fox on the lighthearted backup feature  The Elongated Man  in Detective Comics  369  the flagship Batman title  Shortly afterward  he drew Batman himself  along with the supernatural superhero the Spectre  on the cover of The Brave and the Bold  75  Jan  1968    the first published instance of Adams  work on what would become two of his signature comics characters  The first instance of Adams drawing Batman in an interior story was  The Superman Batman Revenge Squads  in World s Finest Comics  175  May 1968   21  Another  his breakout character  was the supernatural hero Deadman  who had debuted in DC s Strange Adventures  205  Nov  1967   Adams succeeded co creator artist Carmine Infantino with the following issue s 17 page story  An Eye for an Eye   22  written by Arnold Drake  with George Roussos inking Adams  pencils  Adams went on to draw both the covers and stories for issues 207 216  Dec  1967   Feb  1969   and taking over the scripting with  212  June 1968   The series became a fan sensation  23  winning many awards and being almost immediately inducted into the Alley Award Hall of Fame  with Adams himself receiving a special award  for the new perspective and dynamic vibrance he has brought to the field of comic art   Adams concurrently drew covers and stories for The Spectre  2 5  Feb  Aug  1968   also writing the latter two issues  and became DC s primary cover artist well into the 1970s  Adams recalled that Infantino  was appointed art director  and decided I was going to be his spark plug  I also thought it was a good idea  and was promised a number of things which were never fulfilled  But I thought it would be an adventure anyway  so I knuckled down to things like  Deadman   The Spectre and whatever odd things would come my way  I was also doing large amounts of covers   24  Adams was called upon to rewrite and redraw a Teen Titans story which had been written by then newcomers Len Wein and Marv Wolfman  The story  titled  Titans Fit the Battle of Jericho    would have introduced DC s first African American superhero but was rejected by Publisher Carmine Infantino  25  The revised story appeared in Teen Titans  20  March April 1969   Adams  art style  honed in advertising and in the photorealistic school of dramatic serial comics strips  26  marked a signal change from most comics art to that time  Comics writer and columnist Steve Grant wrote in 2009 that  Jim Steranko at Marvel and Neal Adams were the most prominent new artists of the late  60s to enter a field that had been relatively hostile to new artists     and breaths of modernism  referencing advertising art and pop art as much as comics  Despite vastly different styles  both favored designs that drew on depth of focus and angularity that put the reader in the center of the action while slightly disorienting them to increase the tension  and placed special emphasis on lighting and body language as emotion cues  Not that these things were unknown in comics by any stretch  but publishers traditionally deemphasized them   As well  b oth were hugely influential on how a new generation of artists thought about what comics should look like  though Adams was arguably more influential  his approach was more visceral and  more importantly  he ran a studio in Manhattan  Continuity Associates  where many young artists started their professional careers  27   edit  First Marvel Comics work X Men  63  Dec  1969   Cover art by Adams and Tom Palmer  While continuing to freelance for DC  Adams in 1969 also began freelancing for Marvel Comics  where he penciled several issues of the mutant superhero team title X Men and one story for a horror anthology title  Such freelancing across the two leading companies was rare at the time  most DC creators who did so worked pseudonymously  28  Adams recalled in 1976  The first time I got away from DC was when I went to Marvel to do the X Men  It didn t stop me from working at DC  they were a little annoyed at me  but that was a calculated plan      If people saw that I would do such a thing  then other people might do it  Beyond that  it seemed like working for Marvel might be an interesting thing to do  It was  as matter of fact  I enjoyed working on the X Men   The company was  more friendly  a lot more real and I found myself delighting in the company of Herb Trimpe  John Romita and Marie Severin  I found them to be people who were not as oppressed as the people at National  i e   DC Comics  were  29  He teamed with writer Roy Thomas on X Men  then on the verge of cancellation  30  starting with issue  56  May 1969   Adams penciled and colored  paired for the first time with inker Tom Palmer  with whom he would collaborate on several acclaimed Marvel comics  the duo s work here netted them 1969 Alley Awards for Best Pencil Artist and Best Inking Artist  respectively   Thomas won that year for Best Writer   Though the team failed to save the title  which ended its initial run with  66  March 1970   the collaboration here and on the  Kree Skrull War  arc of The Avengers  93 97  Nov  1971   May 1972  produced what comics historians regard as some of Marvel s creative highlights of the era  31  Adams also wrote and penciled the horror story  One Hungers  in Tower of Shadows  2  Dec  1969   and co wrote with Thomas  but did not draw  another in Chamber of Darkness  2  Dec  1969    edit  Batman Continuing to work for DC Comics during this sojourn  while also contributing the occasional story to Warren Publishing s black and white horror comics magazines  including the Don Glut scripted  Goddess from the Sea  in Vampirella  1  Sept  1969   Adams had his first collaboration on Batman with writer Dennis O Neil  32  The duo  under the direction of editor Julius Schwartz  33  would revitalize the character with a series of noteworthy stories reestablishing Batman s dark  brooding nature and taking the books away from the campy look and feel of the 1966 68 ABC TV series  34  Their first two stories were  The Secret of the Waiting Graves  in Detective Comics  395  Jan  1970  and  Paint a Picture of Peril  in issue  397  March 1970   with a short Batman backup story  written by Mike Friedrich  coming in between  in Batman  219  Feb  1970   Adams introduced new characters to the Batman mythos beginning with Man Bat co created with writer Frank Robbins in Detective Comics  400  June 1970   35  O Neil and Adams  creation Ra s al Ghul was introduced in the story  Daughter of the Demon  in Batman  232  June 1971  36  and the character would later appear in the 2005 film Batman Begins and be portrayed by actor Liam Neeson  The Joker was revitalized in  The Joker s Five Way Revenge   in Batman  251  Sept  1973   a landmark story bringing the character back to his roots as a homicidal maniac who murders people on a whim and delights in his mayhem  37  38   edit  Green Lantern Green Arrow and  relevant comics  Batman s enduring makeover was contemporaneous 39  with Adams and O Neil s celebrated and  for the time  controversial revamping of the longstanding DC characters Green Lantern and Green Arrow  Rechristening Green Lantern vol  2 as Green Lantern Green Arrow with issue  76  April 1970   O Neil and Adams teamed these two very different superheroes in a long story arc in which the characters undertook a social commentary journey across America  40  A few months earlier  Adams updated Green Arrow s visual appearance by designing a new costume for the character in The Brave and the Bold  85  Aug  Sept 1969   41  A major exemplar of what the industry and the public at the time called  relevant comics   42  the landmark run began with the 23 page story  No Evil Shall Escape My Sight  and continued to      And through Him Save a World  in the series  finale   89  May 1972   43  It was during this period that one of the best known O Neil Adams stories appeared  in Green Lantern  85 86  when it was revealed that Green Arrow s ward Speedy was addicted to heroin  44  45  Wrote historian Ron Goulart  Green Lantern Green Arrow 76  April 1970   Cover art by Adams  These angry issues deal with racism  overpopulation  pollution  and drug addiction  The drug abuse problem was dramatized in an unusual and unprecedented way by showing Green Arrow s heretofore clean cut boy companion Speedy turning into a heroin addict  All this endeared DC to the dedicated college readers of the period and won awards for both artist and writer  Sales  however  weren t especially influenced by the praise  and by 1973 the crusading had ceased  I remember dropping in on  editor  Julius Schwartz about this time and asking him how relevance was doing   Relevance is dead   he informed me  not too cheerfully  34  After Green Lantern was cancelled  the adventures of both super heroes continued on the pages of The Flash  217 219 and  226  1972 74   edit  Other work for DC After Green Lantern Green Arrow  Adams  contributions to DC  apart from his work on Batman  were sporadic  limiting to draw a Clark Kent back up story in Superman  254  1972  and sharing credits with Jim Aparo pencilling the Teen Titans in Brave and the Bold  102  1972   Adams also drew a few stories for Weird Western Tales and House of Mystery and covers for Action Comics and Justice League of America titles as well  Adams worked on the first intercompany superhero crossover Superman vs  the Amazing Spider Man  Several of the Superman figures were redrawn by him  46  The last complete story that Adams drew at DC before opening his own company  Continuity Associates  was the oversize Superman vs  Muhammad Ali  1978  which Adams has called a personal favorite  47  After this  Adams  production for DC and Marvel was mainly limited to new covers for reprint editions of some of his work  such as Green Lantern Green Arrow  The Avengers  The Kree Skrull War  X Men  Visionaries  Deadman Collection and The Saga of Ra s al Ghul  which were variously published as reprint miniseries or trade paperback collections  In 1990  he designed a new costume for DC s Robin character 48  and drew a miniposter included in the first issue of the Robin limited series  49   edit  Return to DC and Marvel In 2005 Adams returned to Marvel  his last collaboration for this publisher had been in 1981 drawing a story for the Bizarre Adventures magazine  to draw a 8 page story for the Giant Size X Men  3  50  The following year Adams  among other artists  provided art to Young Avengers Special  1  51  In 2010  DC Comics announced that Adams would return as writer and artist on the new miniseries Batman  Odyssey  52   Originally conceived as a 12 issue story  the series ran only to issue  6  Feb  2011  53  54   and was relaunched with vol  2   1 in October 2011  55  Adams penciled New Avengers vol  2   16 1  Nov  2011   teaming again with inker Tom Palmer  56  nearly 40 years since both artists had worked together on The Avengers  96  Feb  1972   57  58    edit  Movie and theater work Adams  pencil drawings on his later Batman stories were frequently inked by Dick Giordano  with whom Adams formed Continuity Associates  a company that primarily supplied storyboards for motion pictures  In the early 1970s  Adams was the art director  costume designer  as well as the poster Playbill illustrator for Warp   a science fiction stage play by director Stuart Gordon and playwright Lenny Kleinfeld under the pseudonym Bury St  Edmund  59   edit  Creator s rights During the 1970s  Adams was politically active in the industry  and attempted to unionize its creative community  His efforts  along with precedents set by Atlas Seaboard Comics  creator friendly policies and other factors  helped lead to the modern industry s standard practice of returning original artwork to the artist  who can earn additional income from art sales to collectors  He won his battle in 1987  when Marvel returned original artwork to him and industry legend Jack Kirby  among others  60  61  Adams notably and vocally helped lead the lobbying efforts that resulted in Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster receiving decades overdue credit and some financial remuneration from DC  Inker Bob McLeod recalled in the 2000s the unique place Adams held in the industry when McLeod broke into comics in 1973  Pat  Broderick  told me I really ought to meet Neal Adams  whom he had met at DC        At that time  Neal held a position of respect in the industry that no one in comics since then has achieved  He was the single most respected artist in the business        Neal looked at one of my samples and asked me what kind of work I was looking for  I said   Anything that pays    By that time  I was down to my last  10         He just picked up the phone and called the production manager at Marvel and said   I ve got a guy here who has some potential as  well  some potential as an artist  but I think he has a lot of potential as a letterer   I was immediately hired at Marvel in the production department on Neal s recommendation  and they still didn t even want to see my portfolio  If I was good enough for Neal  I was good enough for them  62  In 1978  Adams helped form the Comics Creators Guild  which over three dozen comic book writers and artists joined  63  Also during the 1970s  Adams illustrated paperback novels in the Tarzan series for Ballantine Books  64  With the independent comic publishing boom of the early 1980s  he began working for Pacific Comics  where he produced the poorly received Skateman  and other publishers  and founded his own Continuity Comics as an off shoot of Continuity Associates  His comic book company s characters include Megalith  Bucky O Hare  Skeleton Warriors  CyberRad  and Ms  Mystic  He and fellow artist Michael Netzer entered into a dispute over intellectual property rights to Ms  Mystic  a character they had worked on jointly in 1977  which Adams had published under the Pacific Comics and Continuity Comics imprints  leading to a lawsuit against Adams in United States District Court in 1993  65  The case was dismissed in 1997  citing the statute of limitations  66  Adams and Rafael Medoff promoting They Spoke Out  American Voices Against the Holocaust at the Big Apple Convention  May 21  2011  In collaboration with Rafael Medoff  director of the David S  Wyman Institute for Holocaust Studies  Adams has championed an effort to get the Auschwitz Birkenau State Museum  which is operated by the government of Poland  to return the original artwork of Dina Babbitt  In exchange for his sparing her mother and herself from the gas chambers  Babbitt worked as an illustrator for Nazi death camp doctor Josef Mengele who wanted detailed paintings to demonstrate his pseudoscientific theories about Gypsy racial inferiority  67  Using text from Medoff  Adams illustrated a six page graphic documentary about Babbitt that was inked by Joe Kubert and contains an introduction by Stan Lee  68  However  Adams deemphasizes any comparison between the Babbitt case and his struggle for creator rights  saying that her situation was  tragic  and  an atrocity   67  In 2010  Adams and Medoff teamed with Disney Educational Productions to produce They Spoke Out  American Voices Against the Holocaust  an online educational motion comics series that tells stories of Americans who protested Nazis or helped rescue Jews during the Holocaust  Each standalone episode  which runs from five to ten minutes  utilizes a combination of archival film footage and animatics drawn by Adams  who also narrates   and focus on a different person  The first episode   La Guardia s War Against Hitler  was screened in April 2010 at a festival sponsored by the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art  and tells the story of the forceful stand New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia took against Nazi Germany  La Guardia s actions stood in contrast to the relative passivity of President Franklin Roosevelt  who historians such as David S  Wyman believe did not do as much as he could have to save European Jewry  69  a point underlined in the episode  Messenger from Hell   Other episodes include  Voyage of the Doomed   which focuses on the S S  St  Louis  the ship that carried more than 900 German Jewish refugees but was turned away by Cuban authorities and later the Roosevelt administration  and  Rescue Over the Mountains   which depicts Vivian Fry  the young journalist who led an underground rescue network that smuggled Jewish refugees out of Vichy France  70

Kirby Hall of Fame in 1999   edit  Advocacy of Expanding Earth theory Adams with his son  Josh  at a signing for Batman  Odyssey  1 at Midtown Comics Times Square  July 10  2010  Adams has put forth a pseudo scientific opinion on a model of the universe he terms the  Growing Earth Theory   an idea he credits to Samuel Warren Carey  73  74  While Carey did advocate an expanding Earth model in the mid 20th century  that model has been rejected following the recognition of plate tectonics  75  76  77  Adams rejects tectonics  particularly the theory of subduction  which he says has only been shown to exist in one place on earth and that geologists have grabbed onto it to make their model work  78  He claims that the Earth is not merely expanding by increasing its volume  but rather growing by manufacturing new atomic mass in its core  Adams advocates his ideas in a DVD documentary he wrote and produced  clips of which he displays on his YouTube channel   79  80  Adams appeared on the radio show Coast to Coast AM several times to discuss his claims  81  He was also interviewed by Dr  Steven Novella on a Skeptics Guide podcast in 2006  and afterward continued the debate on Novella s blog  82  His work led to a 3 part magazine feature on Growing Earth and history of Earth sciences in the Japan Times in 2009  83  84  85   edit  Personal life Adams has three sons  Jason
