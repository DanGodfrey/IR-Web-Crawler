Executive Branch 3 See also 4 Notes 5 References  edit  Scope and organization of political scandals The article is organized by presidential terms and then divided into scandals of the Executive  Legislative and Judicial Branches  Members of both parties are listed under the term of the president in office at the time the scandal took place  Scandals  There is no hard and fast rule defining scandals  Scandal is defined as  loss of or damage to reputation caused by actual or apparent violation of morality or propriety   In politics scandal should be kept separate from  controversy    which implies two differing points of view  and  unpopularity   Many decisions are controversial  many decisions are unpopular  that alone does not make them scandals  A good guideline is whether or not an action is  or appears to be  illegal  Since everyone  particularly a politician  is expected to be law abiding  breaking the law is  by definition  a scandal  Misunderstandings  breaches of ethics  unproven crimes or cover ups may or may not result in scandals depending on who is bringing the charges  the amount of publicity garnered  and the seriousness of the crime  if any  The finding of a court with jurisdiction is the sole method used to determine a violation of law  There is no bright line to distinguish  major  scandals from  minor  scandals  but rather scandals tend to be defined by the public themselves and the media s desire to feed that particular frenzy  Thus  small but salacious scandals  such as Larry Craig s  R ID  arrest for lewd behavior can eclipse more serious scandals such as suspending the Writ of Habeas Corpus in time of war  What is also not so clear  is how far down the ladder of obscurity a scandal should go  During the Truman  D  administration  196 local IRS staffers were found to be corrupt  but they were so far removed from Washington  Truman or any of his appointees  that it could hardly be called a  Truman scandal   Also not included in this article are pervasive systemic scandals  such as the role of money in  normal  politics which purchases access and influence  Neither are  revolving door  stories  which is the practice of hiring government officials to promote or lobby for companies they were recently paid to regulate  Though some rules now apply  to a great extent this is legal in the United States  Politicians are those who make their living primarily in politics  their staffs and appointees  By definition  political scandals should involve politicians and not private citizens  Private citizens should be included only when they are closely linked to elected or appointed politicians such as party officials  Kenneth Lay of Enron  is a good example of such a citizen  This list also does not include crimes which occur outside the politician s tenure unless they specifically stem from acts while they were in office  Scope To keep the article a manageable size  Senators and Congressmen who are rebuked  admonished  condemned  suspended  found in contempt  found to have acted improperly  used poor judgement or were reprimanded by Congress are not included unless the scandal is exceptional or leads to expulsion  See Also at the bottom of the article has links to related articles which deal with politicians who are actually convicted of crimes  as well as differentiating between federal  state and local scandals and two separate articles are devoted to sex crimes and scandals   edit  Federal government scandals  edit  2009  Obama Administration  edit  Executive Branch  edit
