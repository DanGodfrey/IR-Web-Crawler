the Federal Republic of Nigeria  is a federal constitutional republic comprising 36 states and its Federal Capital Territory  Abuja  The country is located in West Africa and shares land borders with the Republic of Benin in the west  Chad and Cameroon in the east  and Niger in the north  Its coast in the south lies on the Gulf of Guinea on the Atlantic Ocean  The three largest and most influential ethnic groups in Nigeria are the Hausa  Igbo and Yoruba  In terms of religion Nigeria is roughly split half and half between Muslims and Christians with a very small minority who practice traditional religion  The people of Nigeria have an extensive history  Archaeological evidence shows that human habitation of the area dates back to at least 9000 BCE  5  The area around the Benue and Cross River is thought to be the original homeland of the Bantu migrants who spread across most of central and southern Africa in waves between the 1st millennium BC and the 2nd millennium  The name Nigeria was taken from the Niger River running through the country  This name was coined by Flora Shaw  the future wife of Baron Lugard  a British colonial administrator  in the late 19th century  Since 2002 there have been a spate of clashes in the north of the country between government forces and the Boko Haram militant group which seeks to establish sharia law  Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa  the seventh most populous country in the world  and the most populous country in the world in which the majority of the population is black  6  It is listed among the  Next Eleven

The Nok people of central Nigeria produced the earliest terracotta sculptures found in the country  7  In the northern part of the country  Kano and Katsina have a recorded history dating back to around 999  Hausa kingdoms and the Kanem Bornu Empire prospered as trade posts between North and West Africa  At the beginning of the 19th century under Usman dan Fodio the Fulani led the centralized Fulani Empire which continued until 1903 when the Fulani population and land were divided into various European colonies  Between 1750 and 1900  one to two thirds of the population of the Fulani jihad states consisted of slaves  8  The royal Bini mask  one of Nigeria s most recognized artifacts The Yoruba kingdoms of Ife and Oyo in southwestern Nigeria became prominent in the 12th 9  10  and 14th 11  century respectively  However  Yoruba mythology states that Ile Ife is the source of the human race and that it pre dates any other civilization  although the oldest signs of human settlement dates back to the 9th century  9  If  produced terracotta and bronze figures  and  y  once extended from western Nigeria to Togo  The Kingdom of Benin is located in southwestern Nigeria  Benin s power lasted between the 15th and 19th century  Their dominance reached as far as the city of Eko  an Edo name later changed to Lagos by the Portuguese  and further  12  The Kingdom of Nri of the Igbo people started in the 10th century until it lost its sovereignty to the British in 1911  It is the oldest kingdom in Nigeria  13  14  Nri was ruled by the Eze Nri  and the city of Nri is considered to be the foundation of Igbo culture  Nri and Aguleri  where the Igbo creation myth originates  are in the territory of the Umeuri clan who trace their lineages back to the patriarchal king figure Eri  15  The oldest pieces of bronzes made out of the lost wax process in West Africa were from Igbo Ukwu  a city under Nri influence  13  Colonial era Main article  Colonial Nigeria Benin city in the 17th century with the Oba of Benin in procession  This image was pictured in a European book  Description of Africa  in 1668  16  Spaniard and Portuguese explorers were the first Europeans to begin trade in Nigeria in the port they named Lagos and in Calabar  The Europeans traded with the ethnicities of the coast and also negotiated a trade in slaves  to the detriment and profit of many Nigerian ethnicities  Consequently many of the citizens of the former slave nations of the British Empire are descended from a Nigerian ethnic group  Britain abolished its slave trade in 1807 and  following the Napoleonic Wars  established the West Africa Squadron in an attempt to halt the international traffic in slaves  17  In 1885  British claims to a West African sphere of influence received international recognition  and in the following year the Royal Niger Company was chartered under the leadership of Sir George Taubman Goldie  In 1900 the company s territory came under the control of the British government  which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria  On January 1  1901  Nigeria became a British protectorate  part of the British Empire  the foremost world power at the time  Many wars against subjugation had been fought by the states of what later became Nigeria against the British Empire in the late 19th and early 20th centuries  Notably of those were the British Conquest of Benin in 1897 and the Anglo Aro War from 1901 1902  The restraint or complete destruction of these states opened up the Niger area to British rule  In 1914  the Niger area was formally united as the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria  Administratively  Nigeria remained divided into the northern and southern provinces and Lagos Colony  Western education and the development of a modern economy proceeded more rapidly in the south than in the north  with consequences felt in Nigeria s political life ever since  Slavery was not finally outlawed in northern Nigeria until 1936  18  Following World War II  in response to the growth of Nigerian nationalism and demands for independence  successive constitutions legislated by the British government moved Nigeria toward self government on a representative and increasingly federal basis  By the middle of the 20th century  the great wave for independence was sweeping across Africa  Post independence On October 1  1960  Nigeria gained its independence from the United Kingdom  Newly independent  Nigeria s government was a coalition of conservative parties  the Nigerian People s Congress  NPC   a party dominated by Northerners and those of the Islamic faith  and the Igbo and Christian dominated National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons  NCNC  led by Nnamdi Azikiwe  who became Nigeria s maiden Governor General in 1960  Forming the opposition was the comparatively liberal Action Group  AG   which was largely dominated by the Yoruba and led by Obafemi Awolowo  19  The cultural and political differences between Nigeria s dominant ethnicities  the Hausa   Northerners    Igbo   Easterners   and Yoruba   Westerners    were sharp  An imbalance was created in the polity by the result of the 1961 plebiscite  Southern Cameroon opted to join the Republic of Cameroon while northern Cameroon chose to remain in Nigeria  The northern part of the country was now far larger than the southern part  The nation parted with its British legacy in 1963 by declaring itself a Federal Republic  with Azikiwe as its first president  When elections came about in 1965  the AG was outmanoeuvred for control of Nigeria s Western Region by the Nigerian National Democratic Party  Nigerian Biafran War Main article  Nigerian Civil War Severely malnourished woman during the Nigerian Biafran war of the late 1960s  The disequilibrium and perceived corruption of the electoral and political process led in 1966 to several back to back military coups  The first was in January and led by a collection of young leftists under Major Emmanuel Ifeajuna and Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu  It was partially successful  the coup plotters murdered Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa  Premier Ahmadu Bello of the Northern Region and Premier Ladoke Akintola of the Western Region  Despite this  they could not set up a central government  President Nwafor Orizu was then pressured to hand over government to the Nigeria Army  under the command of General JTU Aguyi Ironsi  The coup was counter acted by another successful plot  supported primarily by Northern military officers and Northerners who favoured the NPC  it was engineered by Northern officers  which allowed Lt Colonel Yakubu Gowon to become head of state  This sequence of events led to an increase in ethnic tension and violence  The Northern coup  which was mostly motivated by ethnic and religious reasons was a bloodbath of both military officers and civilians  especially those of Igbo extraction  citation needed  The violence against the Igbo increased their desire for autonomy and protection from the military s wrath  By May 1967  the Eastern Region had declared itself an independent state called the Republic of Biafra under the leadership of Lt Colonel Emeka Ojukwu in line with the wishes of the people  20  The Nigerian Civil War began as the Nigerian  Western and Northern  side attacked Biafra  South eastern  on July 6  1967 at Garkem signalling the beginning of the 30 month war that ended in January 1970  21  Estimates in the former Eastern Region of the number of dead from hostilities  disease  and starvation during the thirty month civil war are estimated at between 1 million and 3 million  22  Military era During the oil boom of the 1970s  Nigeria joined OPEC  and billions of dollars generated by production in the oil rich Niger Delta flowed into the coffers of the Nigerian state  The northern military clique benefited from the oil boom to the detriment of the Nigerian people and economy  As oil revenues fueled the rise of federal subventions to states and precariously to individuals  the federal government soon became the centre of political struggle and the centre became the threshold of power in the country  As oil production and revenue rose  the Nigerian government created a dangerous situation as it became increasingly dependent on oil revenues and the international commodity markets for budgetary and economic concerns eschewing economic stability  That spelled doom to federalism in Nigeria  23  Beginning in 1979  Nigerians participated in a brief return to democracy when Obasanjo transferred power to the civilian regime of Shehu Shagari  The Shagari government was viewed as corrupt and incompetent by virtually all sectors of Nigerian society  so when the regime was overthrown by the military coup of Muhammadu Buhari shortly after the regime s fraudulent re election in 1984  it was generally viewed as a positive development by most of the population  24  Buhari promised major reforms  but his government fared little better than its predecessor  and his regime was overthrown by yet another military coup in 1985  25  Nigerian troops  part of the United Nations African Union Mission in Darfur  embarking on a US Aircraft The new head of state  Ibrahim Babangida  promptly declared himself president and commander in chief of the armed forces and the ruling Supreme Military Council and also set 1990 as the official deadline for a return to democratic governance  Babangida s tenure was marked by a flurry of political activity  he instituted the International Monetary Fund s Structural Adjustment Program  SAP  to aid in the repayment of the country s crushing international debt  which most federal revenue was dedicated to servicing  He also inflamed religious tensions in the nation and particularly the south by enrolling Nigeria in the Organisation of the Islamic Conference  26  After Babangida survived an abortive coup  he pushed back the promised return to democracy to 1992  When free and fair elections were finally held on 12 June 1993  Babangida declared that the results showing a presidential victory for Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola null and void  sparking mass civilian violence in protest which effectively shut down the country for weeks and forced Babangida to keep his promise to relinquish office to a civilian run government  27  Babangida s regime is adjudged to be at the apogee of corruption in the history of the nation as it was during his time that corruption became officially diluted in Nigeria  28  Babangida s caretaker regime headed by Ernest Shonekan survived only until late 1993 when General Sani Abacha took power in another military coup  Abacha proved to be perhaps Nigeria s most brutal ruler and employed violence on a wide scale to suppress the continuing civilian unrest  Money had been found in various western European banks traced to him  He avoided coup plots by bribing army generals  Several hundred million dollars in accounts traced to him were discovered in 1999  29  The regime came to an end in 1998 when the dictator was found dead amid dubious circumstances  Abacha s death yielded an opportunity for return to civilian rule  Return to democracy Nigeria re achieved democracy in 1999 when it elected Olusegun Obasanjo  the former military head of state  as the new President of Nigeria ending almost 33 years of military rule  from 1966 until 1999  excluding the short lived second republic  between 1979 and 1983  by military dictators who seized power in coups d  tat and counter coups during the Nigerian military juntas of 1966 1979 and 1983 1998  Although the elections which brought Obasanjo to power in 1999 and again in 2003 were condemned as unfree and unfair  Nigeria has shown marked improvements in attempts to tackle government corruption and to hasten development  Ethnic violence over the oil producing Niger Delta region and inadequate infrastructures are some of the current issues in the country  Umaru Yar Adua of the People s Democratic Party came into power in the general election of 2007   an election that was witnessed and condemned by the international community as being severely flawed  30  Yar Adua died on 5 May 2010  Dr  Goodluck Jonathan was sworn in as Yar Adua s replacement on 6 May 2010  31  becoming Nigeria s 14th Head of State  while his vice a former Kaduna state governor  Namadi Sambo  an architect was chosen on 18 May 2010 by the National Assembly following President Goodluck Jonathan s nomination for Sambo to be his Vice President  32  33  Goodluck Jonathan served as Nigeria s president till April 16  2011 when a new presidential election in Nigeria was conducted  Goodluck Jonathan of the People s Democratic Party  PDP  was declared the winner on 19 April 2011 having won the election by a total of 22 495 187 of the 39 469 484 votes cast to stand ahead of Muhammadu Buhari from the main opposition party  the The Congress for Progressive Change  CPC   which won 12 214 853 of the total votes cast  34  The international media reported the elections as having run smoothly with relatively little violence or voter fraud in contrast to previous elections  35  Boko Haram is an Islamist movement that seeks to abolish the secular system of government and establish Sharia law in the country  36  37  Government and politics Main article  Politics of Nigeria See also  Federal Ministries of Nigeria Nigeria is a Federal Republic modelled after the United States  38  with executive power exercised by the president and with overtones of the Westminster System model citation needed  in the composition and management of the upper and lower houses of the bicameral legislature  The current president of Nigeria is Goodluck Jonathan  who succeeded Umaru Musa Yar Adua to the office in 2010  The president presides as both Head of State and head of the national executive and is elected by popular vote to a maximum of two four year terms  2  The president s power is checked by a Senate and a House of Representatives  which are combined in a bicameral body called the National Assembly  The Senate is a 109 seat body with three members from each state and one from the capital region of Abuja  members are elected by popular vote to four year terms  The House contains 360 seats and the number of seats per state is determined by population  2  Ethnocentrism  tribalism  religious persecution  and prebendalism have played a visible role in Nigerian politics both prior and subsequent to independence in 1960  Kin selective altruism has made its way into Nigerian politics and has spurned various attempts by tribalists to concentrate Federal power to a particular region of their interests  39  Nationalism has also led to active secessionist movements such as MASSOB  Nationalist movements such as Oodua Peoples Congress  Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta and a civil war  Nigeria s three largest ethnic groups  Hausa  Igbo and Yoruba  have maintained historical preeminence in Nigerian politics  competition amongst these three groups has fuelled corruption and graft  40  Because of the above issues  Nigeria s current political parties are pan national and irreligious in character  though this does not preclude the continuing preeminence of the dominant ethnicities   40  41  The major political parties at present include the ruling People s Democratic Party of Nigeria which maintains 223 seats in the House and 76 in the Senate  61 9  and 69 7  respectively   the opposition All Nigeria People s Party has 96 House seats and 27 in the Senate  26 6  and 24 7    There are also about twenty other minor opposition parties registered  The immediate past president  Olusegun Obasanjo  acknowledged fraud and other electoral  lapses  but said the result reflected opinion polls  In a national television address he added that if Nigerians did not like the victory of his handpicked successor they would have an opportunity to vote again in four years  42  National Symbols of Nigeria Flag Bicolour Emblem Coat of arms of Nigeria Anthem Arise  O

major challenges to Nigeria  as vote rigging and other means of coercion are practised by all major parties in order to remain competitive  In 1983  it was adjudged by the policy institute at Kuru that only the 1959 and 1979 elections witnessed minimal rigging  43  Law Main article  Law of Nigeria There are four distinct systems of law in Nigeria  English law which is derived from its colonial past with Britain  Common law  a development of its post colonial independence  Customary law which is derived from indigenous traditional norms and practice  including the dispute resolution meetings of pre colonial Yorubaland secret societies and the  kp  and Ok nk  of Igboland and Ibibioland  Sharia law  used only in the predominantly Muslim north of the country  It is an Islamic legal system which had been used long before the colonial administration in Nigeria but recently politicised and spearheaded in Zamfara in late 1999 and eleven other states followed suit  These states are Kano  Katsina  Niger  Bauchi  Borno  Kaduna  Gombe  Sokoto  Jigawa  Yobe  and Kebbi  44  The country has a judicial branch  the highest court of which is the Supreme Court of Nigeria  2  Foreign relations Main article  Foreign relations of Nigeria Upon gaining independence in 1960  Nigeria made the liberation and restoration of the dignity of Africa the centrepiece of its foreign policy and played a leading role in the fight against the apartheid regime in South Africa  45  One notable exception to the African focus of Nigeria s foreign policy was the close relationship the country enjoyed with Israel throughout the 1960s  with the latter country sponsoring and overseeing the construction of Nigeria s parliament buildings  46  Nigeria s foreign policy was soon tested in the 1970s after the country emerged united from its own civil war and quickly committed itself to the liberation struggles going on in the Southern Africa sub region  Though Nigeria never sent an expeditionary force in that struggle  it offered more than rhetoric to the African National Congress  ANC  by taking a committed tough line with regard to the racist regime and their incursions in southern Africa  in addition to expediting large sums to aid anti colonial struggles  Nigeria was also a founding member of the Organisation for African Unity  now the African Union   and has tremendous influence in West Africa and Africa on the whole  Nigeria has additionally founded regional cooperative efforts in West Africa  functioning as standard bearer for ECOWAS and ECOMOG  economic and military organizations respectively  With this African centred stance  Nigeria readily sent troops to the Congo at the behest of the United Nations shortly after independence  and has maintained membership since that time   Nigeria also supported several Pan African and pro self government causes in the 1970s  including garnering support for Angola s MPLA  SWAPO in Namibia  and aiding anti colonial struggles in Mozambique  and Zimbabwe  then Rhodesia  military and economically  Nigeria retains membership in the Non Aligned Movement  and in late November 2006 organized an Africa South America Summit in Abuja to promote what some attendees termed  South South  linkages on a variety of fronts  47  Nigeria is also a member of the International Criminal Court  and the Commonwealth of Nations  from which it was temporarily expelled in 1995 under the Abacha regime  Nigeria has remained a key player in the international oil industry since the 1970s  and maintains membership in Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC which it joined in July  1971  Its status as a major petroleum producer figures prominently in its sometimes vicissitudinous international relations with both developed countries  notably the United States and more recently China and developing countries  notably Ghana  Jamaica and Kenya  48  Millions of Nigerians have emigrated at times of economic hardship to Europe  North America and Australia among others  It is estimated that over a million Nigerians have emigrated to the United States and constitute the Nigerian American populace  Of such Diasporic communities include the  Egbe Omo Yoruba  society  49  Military See also  Military of Nigeria The Nigerian Military are charged with protecting The Federal Republic of Nigeria  promoting Nigeria s global security interests  and supporting peacekeeping efforts especially in West Africa  The Nigerian Military consist of an Army  a Navy and an Air Force  2  The military in Nigeria have played a major role in the country s history since independence  Various juntas have seized control of the country and ruled it through most of its history  Its last period of rule ended in 1999 following the sudden death of former dictator Sani Abacha in 1998  with his successor  Abdulsalam Abubakar  handing over power to the democratically elected government of Olusegun Obasanjo in 1999  Taking advantage of its role as Africa s most populated country  Nigeria has repositioned its military as an African peacekeeping force  Since 1995  the Nigerian military through ECOMOG mandates have been deployed as peacekeepers in Liberia  1997   Ivory Coast  1997 1999   Sierra Leone 1997 1999  50  and presently in Sudan s Darfur region under an African Union mandate  Geography Main articles  Geography of Nigeria and Climate of Nigeria Nigeria is located in western Africa on the Gulf of Guinea and has a total area of 923 768 km2  356 669 sq mi   51  making it the world s 32nd largest country  after

at 2 419 m  7 936 ft   The main rivers are the Niger and the Benue River which converge and empty into the Niger Delta  one of the world s largest river deltas and the location of a large area of Central African Mangroves  Nigeria is also an important center for biodiversity  It is widely believed that the areas surrounding Calabar  Cross River State  contain the world s largest diversity of butterflies  The drill monkey is only found in the wild in Southeast Nigeria and neighbouring Cameroon  Nigeria has a varied landscape  The far south is defined by its tropical rainforest climate  where annual rainfall is 60 to 80 inches  1 524 to 2 032 mm  a year  53  In the southeast stand the Obudu Plateau  Coastal plains are found in both the southwest and the southeast  54  This forest zone s most southerly portion is defined as salt water swamp  also known as a mangrove swamp because of the large amount of mangroves in the area  North of this is fresh water swamp  containing different vegetation from the salt water swamp  and north of that is rain forest  55  55  Nigeria s most expansive topographical region is that of the valleys of the Niger and Benue River valleys  which merge into each other and form a  y  shape   54  To the southwest of the Niger there is  rugged  highland  and to the southeast of the Benue are hills and mountains which forms the Mambilla Plateau the highest Plateau in Nigeria This plateau extends to the border with Cameroon  this montane land is part of the Bamenda Highlands in Cameroon  The area near the border with Cameroon close to the coast is rich rainforest and part of the Cross Sanaga Bioko coastal forests ecoregion  an important centre for biodiversity including the drill monkey which is only found in the wild in this area and across the border in Cameroon  It is widely believed that the areas surrounding Calabar  Cross River State  also in this forest  contain the world s largest diversity of butterflies  The area of southern Nigeria between the Niger and the Cross Rivers has seen its forest more or less disappear to be replaced by grassland  see Cross Niger transition forests   Everything in between the far south and the far north  is savannah  insignificant tree cover  with grasses and flowers located between trees   and rainfall is between 20 and 60 inches  508 and 1 524 mm  per year  53  The savannah zone s three categories are Guinean forest savanna mosaic  plains of tall grass which are interrupted by trees and the most common across the country  Sudan savannah  similar but with  shorter grasses and shorter trees  and Sahel savannah  comprised patches of grass and sand  found in the northeast  55  To the north is the Sahel with its almost desert like climate  where rain is less than 20 inches  508 mm  per year and the Sahara Desert is encroaching  53  In the dry north east corner of the country lies Lake Chad  which Nigeria shares with Niger  Chad and Cameroon  Environmental issues Nigeria s Delta region  home of the large oil industry  experiences serious oil spills and other environmental problems  See Environmental issues in the Niger Delta for more details  and Conflict in the Niger Delta about strife which has arisen in connection with those issues  Waste management including sewage treatment  the linked processes of deforestation and soil degradation  and climate change or global warming are the major environmental problems in Nigeria  Waste management presents problems in a mega city like Lagos and other major Nigerian cities which are linked with economic development  population growth and the inability of municipal councils to manage the resulting rise in industrial and domestic waste  Haphazard industrial planning  increased urbanization  poverty and lack of competence of the municipal government are seen as the major reasons for high levels of waste pollution in major Nigerian cities  Some of the  solutions  have been disastrous to the environment  resulting in untreated waste being dumped in places where it can pollute waterways and groundwater  56  In terms of global warming  Africans contribute only about one metric ton of carbon dioxide per person per year  It is perceived by many climate change experts that food production and security in the northern sahel region of the country will suffer as semi arid areas will have more dry periods in the future  57  Subdivisions Main articles  States of Nigeria and Local Government Areas of Nigeria Nigeria is divided into thirty six states and one Federal Capital Territory  which are further sub divided into 774 Local Government Areas  LGAs   The plethora of states  of which there were only three at independence  reflect the country s tumultuous history and the difficulties of managing such a heterogeneous national entity at all levels of government  Nigeria has six cities with a population of over 1 million people  from largest to smallest  Lagos  Kano  Ibadan  Kaduna  Port

development had been hindered by years of military rule  corruption  and mismanagement  The restoration of democracy and subsequent economic reforms have successfully put Nigeria back on track towards achieving its full economic potential  It is now the second largest economy in Africa  following South Africa   and the largest economy in the West Africa Region  66  During the oil boom of the 1970s  Nigeria accumulated a significant foreign debt to finance major infrastructural investments  With the fall of oil prices during the 1980s oil glut Nigeria struggled to keep up with its loan payments
