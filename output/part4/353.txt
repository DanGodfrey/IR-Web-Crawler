United to simply X2  I noticed  after I already made the change  that this has been an issue in the past  Can we gather some sort of consensus on it  EVula 15 03  3 June 2006  UTC  Apparently  the official title is X2    Chris Griswold 14 39  13 June 2006  UTC  Yeah  but the name on it s DVD is X Men 2  LooseTheHotButtonS 13 15  15 June 2006  UTC  True  but the official name is X2  See X2  film     Chris Griswold 15 45  15 June 2006  UTC   edit  Inclusion I don t really see why minor concepts like the Crimson Dawn and Alkali Lake get linked from the main X Men template when much more major concepts and characters are omitted   Sean Curtin 04 28  6 June 2006  UTC  Such as      Make some suggestions  I have no problem replacing those two with something else  but I can t agree with nothing     EVula 04 51  6 June 2006  UTC  I second a removal of Alkali Lake  mainly because it s a movie only location  I would like to see the template used for comic information with links only to the films themselves  WikiFew 23 48  24 June 2006  UTC  Does anyone know why Mutant X is listed off this template  While I am sure that this tv show was influenced by the X Men in some ways  there is no mention of the X Men on the Mutant X page    Silver lode 03 33  9 August 2006  UTC  I know  I ve been meaning to update the Mutant X article  Sony sued Marvel over the similarity between the television series and the X Men movies  and they settled out of court  It s a TV show by Marvel about a group of mutants fighting under an enigmatic leader on behalf of mutants everywhere  It s not just influenced    Chris Griswold 04 30  9 August 2006  UTC  Cool  I figured you guys wouldnt let it stay on there without a reason  I just couldnt seem to find what it was    Silver lode I recently dug up some articles that deal with the lawsuit  but this past week I ve had spotty Internet service and so have been somewhat limited in what I can add  But I will be adding the information to the Mutant X article soon because it needs some out of universe detail anyway   Chris Griswold 01 51  10 August 2006  UTC   edit  Crossovers I had desired the addition of a Crossovers section to the Template and I think Kusonaga did a good job of this  only to have it removed shortly after  I think it s important to add the most important and influential crossovers  as they have a far greater impact on the X Men Universe than Alkali Lake or the Crimson Dawn  Perhaps  for the sake of keeping the template brief  we should compromise and include the biggest crossovers    WikiFew 21 50  15 July 2006  UTC  Well  obviously  I m in support  Kusonaga 11 22  16 July 2006  UTC  I re added it yesterday after reading WikiFew s comment  I changed it to  Major storylines   which is slightly less comic book jargon y and allows for other important storylines    Chris Griswold 17 39  16 July 2006  UTC  Eh  hottie 12 46  20 July 2006  UTC   edit  Characters It never ceases to amaze me how quickly these things get noticed    within twenty four hours of my adding a character list to the template someone changes it I have no problem with that I m hardly the world s greatest authority on the X Men and if someone with greater knowledge can think of an alternative line up then I m happy for them to do so However  I ve changed  Shadowcat  back to  Kitty Pryde  since I feel this is what the character is better known as  hence it being the name of her character page like Jean Grey  she has used many different codenames over the years making her real name more prominent Skteosk  talk  18 56  5 February 2008  UTC  Weren t characters removed from these templates like two years ago    Gonzalo84  talk  04 34  7 April 2008  UTC  EDIT  nevermind Sookenon  talk  09 37  3 June 2008  UTC   edit  Series Categories I divided the list of series up and made a new category  Past Series   It looks cleaner in my opinion  and it makes it easier to distinguish what is ongoing and what is not  We might also consider dividing Series up into Core titles and others    StarIV  talk  19 31  10 February 2008  UTC   edit  Yellow Come on guys we can come up with a better color than yellow for this thing  can t we  It looks ridiculous  especially since it is an X MEN Template and not an    Iron Fist template   Captain la rose  talk  22 19  17 May 2008  UTC  The first step should be asking  Is there a color scheme that is iconic across the franchise   That includes the later X Men teams  X Factor  X Force  Excalibur  etc  The blue and yellow only covers the  school age  teams  If that s the best possible  then leaving the default may be wise    J Greb  talk  22 30  17 May 2008  UTC  It has been reverted  Rau s Speak Page 22 49  17 May 2008  UTC   edit  Alternate Universe Titles Since when are X Men  First Class and Wolverine  First class alternate universes  I believe that they still take place in 616  they re just set in the past  I think either the section needs to be removed  or renamed   Preceding unsigned comment added by 132 170 102 137  talk  16 12  29 May 2008  UTC  I was unsure of whether or not they are in or out of continuity  so I added them there  Feel free to change it  Rau s Speak Page 00 27  30 May 2008  UTC  I agree that the First Class titles should be listed as mainstream continuity    Darknus823  talk  17 43  6 June 2008  UTC  Nothing that happens in the book has had or has been said to have any effect on the mainstream continuity  Add to the fact of things happening in the books that date them too recent  i e  X Box references  plus relationships with some of the villains  like Scarlet Witch  being different from main continuity  there is nothing in them that says they are in the 616 universe 68 49 68 231  talk  23 54  11 May 2009  UTC  X men First Class and Wolverine First Class are NOT  alternate books   They take place in the 616 marvel universe  not in an alternate universe  Therefore  they are cannon  and not alternate  Labeling them as  flashback  is the best way to go  Classic X men  while also a re print book  also gave new material in continuity  as thus  also qualifies as a  flashback book   I reject your classification of those books as  alternate   and will forever change it unless something better is thought of  I think  flahback  is a fine classification   Abaddon667  talk  17 43  11 May 2009  UTC   First Class books are not in canon with the rest of the line  therefore they are not  flashback  titles  and we do no need an unnecessary line clogging up the template more  68 49 68 231  talk  19 27  10 May 2009  UTC  I disagee with your logic   Alternate  suggests a different world in the Marvel Universe  The first class stories  as well as the back up stories from Classic X men take place in the 616 Marvel Universe  They are thus  cannon   not alternate  Calling the book   flashback  denotes this point  I would disagree that this is an unnecessary distinction   Abaddon667  talk  23 27  11 May 2009  UTC   No  they are not canon  There are things in the books  like the characters playing X Box  as well as relationships which do not fit in with the timelines of the original runs  Hence  they are in an alternate universe  The world s may be similar  but there are enough differences that shows they are alternate worlds  plus  absolutely nothing that has happened in the book has any effect on the main books  and there s been nothing stated as such by anyone working on the book  If you can find something that proves that they are in canon  fine but with all the things that have dated it too recent for it to fit in with past continuity of the main 616 line  there s too much proving that it is NOT canon  This is a site for facts  not opinions   Preceding unsigned comment added by 68 49 68 231  talk  23 51  11 May 2009  UTC  The Marvel Universe is on a  floating timeline  or a  sliding timescale   For example  Flash Thompson from Spider man went to Vietiam originally  but that s been changed to a later conflict make sense in the Marvel Sliding Timeline  The X box example is another feature of this concept of a sliding timeline  As for the Classic X men back up stories  that is canon as well  yet you have no argument for it   Abaddon667  talk  01 55  12 May 2009  UTC   First of all  there was no reason to copy and paste what we said on your talk page  and that may even be violating a rule  Second  I have never said any kind of argument against Classic X Men  which is just reprintings of original issues anyway  so there was no reason to bring it up at all 68 49 68 231  talk  23 39  12 May 2009  UTC  Well  early issues Classic X men also has new stories in it from the past  so I m just saying it qualifies  I just felt this should be a public conversation is all  since this was already a subject debated over  Nothing personal  I ll take down our conversation if you want me too   Preceding unsigned comment added by Abaddon667  talk   contribs  03 42  13 May 2009  UTC    This won t be a study in X Men history but it ll definitely be part of the official X continuity     Scott Gray  Uncanny X Men First Class Writer 1  Uncanny X Men First Class is not an alternate universe 74 47 108 87  talk  04 18  7 September 2009  UTC    Exploring in continuity tales from the X Men s past  WOLVERINE  FIRST CLASS is a must read for all X Men fans     Solicitation  Marvel com  2  Wolverine  First Class is not an alternate universe 74 47 108 87  talk  04 18  7 September 2009  UTC  All of Marvel s alternative universes are canon to the Marvel Universe  official alternative realities are all canon to themselves  The events of the alternative universes just take place in their own canon  All events that occur in Ulimate Marvel are canon to Earth 1610  all events in Marvel Zombies are canon to Earth 2149 etc  they just have a seperate continuity to Earth 616  Even if it was a seperate universe  it would still be canon to whatever universe it is set in  X men and Wolverine First class titles are officially in continuity  Earth 616   They re no more  alternate universe  than the current Astonishing X men series  86 96 226 20  talk  11 20  29 November 2009  UTC   edit  Villains As a major villain  ala Vulcan  and as recurring major villain teams and collective  ala Purifiers  shouldn t the following be included with the X Men s Villains  Cassandra Nova Hellfire Club  comics   Phalanx  comics   and Brood  comics    Kez  talk  01 18  7 August 2008  UTC  Unrelated to previous comment  With Necrosha  and other previous storylines that established her very much a villain outside the Hellfire Club  shouldn t Selene get her own section under  Villains    Kez  talk  23 48  20 October 2009  UTC   edit  writers and artists why insn t a section about the major writers and artists   Preceding unsigned comment added by 98 210 25 252  talk  03 45  15 August 2008  UTC  Nutshell  Consensus with the Navboxes has been  Keep It Simple  Short   List the original creators and create a list article for everyone else  This avoids 1  the recurring argument over who s notable enough to be in the  box and 2  the tendency to add everyone who s put word or image to the character team  By way example see   Batman   and   Green Lantern    With this  box  a creators group could be added to the top  But it would have 3 listings   Lee  Kirby  List of   As an aside  the same variation of KISS would argue that individual member should not be listed   and the constant additions and removals there support that   nor should individual villains that are also part of listed teams     J Greb  talk  10 52  15 August 2008  UTC  Okay I see your logic and id think it should have Lee Kirby and writers artists but what about chris claremont i mean he basically set the standard for x books  Preceding unsigned comment added by 98 210 25 252  talk  05 19  4 October 2008  UTC  That s the problem    if Claremont is included  then why not Cockrum  Bryne  Simonson  Hamma  Windsor Smith  Jim Lee  Morrison  Weadon  and on and on and on  The shortest answer is the 3 items  Stan  Jack  and a list  And a list also allows for expanding on how the various writers and artists contributed to the characters and title    J Greb  talk  15 22  4 October 2008  UTC  Doesn t the fact that Claremont basically wrote X Men and its spin offs single handedly for SIXTEEN YEARS count for anything  All Stan Lee did was write a thirty odd issues of a series that eventually floundered  Claremont made it into the X Behemoth it is today  No other writer s contribution compares  Let s give the guy some credit Es won  talk  01 56  18 November 2008  UTC  And Claremont would have had next to nil to play with in Lee hadn t been there  As for the rest    both the floundering being linked to Lee and everyone else s work on the characters being subservient to Claremont comes across as apocryphal and  The fan wants his fave writer added   If needed  and those POVs do need  a list article or a neutral article covering the ups and downs of the creative teams  sales  and popularity the X books is in order  Such an article would likely start as an un hyped tick off of what each of the writers and artists brought to the property  Such an article would be very relevant to add to this template  But adding the bios of writers and artists beyond the two that  birthed  the concept  No  that s more clutter than this already hard to navigate template needs    J Greb  talk  02 16  18 November 2008  UTC  Ok but then why is there so many characters that are peoples favorites  and nearly all SIXTY x men are there   Preceding unsigned comment added by 98 210 25 252  talk  05 14  26 November 2008  UTC   edit  Wolverine all about wolverine him and his villians  Preceding unsigned comment added by X venomtoxin 134  talk   contribs  03 14  8 February 2009  UTC   edit  Wolverine  First Class Is there an actual Wolverine  First Class article on Wikipedia  Because I can t find one  Wolverine  First Class just redirects to X Men  First Class  and the link in this template sends you to an article on the wolverine  the animal  not the comic character    Rycr  talk  08 01  13 March 2009  UTC   edit  Marvel Noir  and other tidbits X Men Noir isn t an on going but a mini  so I reckon it don t really qualify to be in there  Mutant X  comics  should be added to the past alternate titles tab  Wolverine  Weapon X series is an on going  and as such should be there since the main series and Origins are  If one worries that that tab is getting to big  well  Captain Britain  amp  Co is leaving it soon  RIP     X Men  Kingbreaker is not really that important to the X universe  so probably should be removed from the list of major storylines  If that is kept we might as well put in The Rise and Fall of Shi ar Empire and X Men  Emperor Vulcan  which are kind of more important to the X Men  In my opinon the ones above are not too disagreeable  so I might as well do them anyway  The following though could be more problematic  Bishop  comics  should be in villains  He has been for at least a year  and just cos he once was an X Man don t mean he is one now  There should be a certain level of continuity present in the template  On that note  some time ago the template had the list of all current X Men in bold  I d say that should be brought back  Possibly  embolden  all the X Force and X Factor members too  although not necessary X Factor   With Utopia  comics  coming soon some of the character profiles and status will change  as well as the number of enemies will  well  increase  In particular where do the Dark X Men fit in the template   An aside  any help creating editing referencing all articles connected with Utopia crossover will be greatly appreciated  User Ermol talk  13 June 2009  Preceding undated comment added 16 01  13 June 2009  UTC   The Noir thing is debatable  since there is a chance of Marvel doing more mini s  and that Wolverine has his own one coming out too  the link will take readers straight to the same page for both  Done  Done  Again  debatable  but since it s not something that affects more than one title  it can probably go  In case you haven t seen  there are several characters who have been both X Men and X Villains who are listed as both in the template  If you want to put Bishop under both  then go ahead  but do no remove him from the X Men proper  where he has been known the most  In order to keep arguments down in the past of who belongs on the template and who doesn t  every X Man  past and present  has been included in the X Men list  The villain list could likely use some trimming down  like have those who would fit under one team be taken out and the team name left  but that s something debatable again  But    The bolding idea might work for current characters  only if it doesn t make the template even more busy than it already is  However I would not do anything for those who have been in X Force and X Factor  since they are not considered X Men  another ongoing argument  But when you do this  would you do the same for villains  And where would you also have to do it for any of the other content  This is something that might be smart to get other opinions on before implementing it  so can it please be held off on for the time being  I don t know what you mean by how some of the character profiles will change or how what happens on their own personal pages will affect the template  The enemies list isn t likely to change much at all  except to maybe include the Dark Avengers in it  but that is something that we ll need to wait until the end of the crossover to see where they all stand at the time  The Dark X Men have been put in the X Universe section  since they don t have their own title like all other current teams  and the members aren t considered proper X Men in the Marvel U yet  nor can they be classified by villains until we know what the true motives behind them are and what actions they will take  so they can stay there until we see what happens at the end of the crossover 68 49 68 231  talk  14 29  14 June 2009  UTC  Well by now  i think that they d count as villains because they re basically the same team idea as Dark Avengers and they are considered villains in the Marvel U  We know that for most of them it was this or prison  and the few that didn t join because of this  that are still members  are mentally unstable so even though they don t know that they aren t villains that doesn t exclude them since about 1 2 of x men villains don t consider what they re doing as wrong  However this shouldn t have another section for it because we ve only seen about 7 to nine members  half who ve left and their only villains are Simon Trask x man and the x men  OH and for the other question that will still apply to this template Bolding for characters may not work  simply because nearly half the members on the template are members from right now so it would look kind of wierd  I think that the members who ve been villains or at least major villains should be in th bad guy section  However I don t think all should count since many of the members are more well known as heroes    Mutantkingmagneto  talk  05 51  7 January 2010  UTC     edit  Split box I am currently recommending a split of the template into several different navboxes including  Template X Men storylines  Template X Men characters  and Template X Men media  The current navbox is too large to effectively navigate through  breaking them up would provide more contextually specific navigation for the articles  Similar efforts have been done with Template Batman  The current navbox links to a few hundred different subjects  on a few hundred different pages  this should bring the numbers into a more useful range    Sharp962  talk  20 59  19 August 2009  UTC   Yes to storylines and media  but no to characters  I feel that the characters are always an important part of the main box for any kind of franchise like this and that since they are the life of the franchise  they deserve to be there  If anything  I d trim down the villains section and remove unimportant villains  i e  ones that have been minor having been in only small amount of stories or too new to have done much  and or villains that can fit under a team name 68 49 68 231  talk  20 28  21 August 2009  UTC  It relly looks like the template breaks into three categories  In universe elements   Characters and  Universe  Publications   Titles and publications Other media It also looks like the template should be split on those  Leave the in universe stuff here  create   X Men Storylines   and   X Men in other media    and then deal with the train wreck the IOM section is    J Greb  talk  15 28  22 August 2009  UTC  I actually thought it would work best with 4 total  similar to that of those use in Batman  In universe  Publication  and media     and a trimmed version of the original for the actual X Men page   Sharp962  talk  19 35  24 August 2009  UTC     X Comics   for storylines and   X Men media   were create due to the consensus on this page  I still would like consideration for in universe elements  and a pilot template was created  Any and all feedback would be appreciated    X Men characters    Sharp962  talk  04 35  28 August 2009  UTC   I like the  Comics  amp  arcs  and Media templates  But all that leaves here is essentially what you have in the characters  box on you sandbox  It isn t needed    J Greb  talk  17 55  29 August 2009  UTC  I agree with J Greb  the stuff that is under the  characters  template is essentially the main stuff for X Men in general  so the main X Men template can be edited around to fit that one  to make it similar to the main Batman one which you ve referenced for this change  Though  the one thing I m wondering about is if division by decades is necessary 68 49 68 231  talk  19 33  30 August 2009  UTC  I don t think so    just alphabetize the lists  This is to facilitate navigation  not provide information    J Greb  talk  20 23  30 August 2009  UTC  I used the years to create some order to such a massive lists of characters  Alphabetized is good  but I feel some sort of subheaders will create easier navigation  In the coming week  I ll look to replace templates for the Comics arcs and media   Sharp962  talk  15 05  31 August 2009  UTC   Well  look at it this way  for normal everyday users on here  will they tend to know which decade their favorite character debuted in and look them up in the template that way  or would it be easier just to go straight for their name  In most cases  it s going to be the latter  That is usually why alphabetization is the most common way things are organized  One can go straight to the subject at hand and not have to know specifics behind them to be found  I ve noticed the proposed template to replace the main one has been edited out of your sandbox  so I would like to propose one on my own and see how that will be taken  I will use the one you created and the Batman one you referenced for this split as references for the template  Also  I am going to propose that the   X Men television series   and   X Men video games   templates be merged into your   X Men media   page  68 49 68 231  talk  14 02  6 September 2009  UTC  Comment  Given the enormous number of characters    both hero and villain    then duplicated because they appear in many comics as different reincarnations within different universes  in different tv shows through the years  in several movies  and in many video games  isn t a listing of these characters inside of a navbox that we hope to shorten split a bit over the top  This isn t just one cartoon series where you have a half dozen characters that you see 90  of the time and twice as many villain types or other characters  some of which you may only see once  This is an enormous cast of characters who have each been the focus at one time or another  within the comic book world  at least  through multiple timelines and universes  Such cast group seems more fitting as just link in the navbox to a list  or lists  instead of attempting to list them all or picking and choosing who should and should not belong    CobraWiki   jabber   stuff   04 59  4 September 2009  UTC  As I have stated in this section as well as in the section above  the main reason that everyone who has been a main X Man has been included on the list is to stop fights about who deserves to be there and who doesn t  If they ve been on a mission with X Men and been considered and called a member of the team in the pages of the book  then they re on the list  That s why characters who have helped them out  but been members of other teams or just students and not junior X Men at the time are not kept on the list  As for the villains  I have agreed time and again that that section is too large  I m going to propose a trimmed down one after the split that Sharp has proposed  and first  I m going to split that into two sections  Villains and villain teams  Anyone who is known for being a member of a villain team  but has not been known for major acts on their own outside of the team  will not be kept as a singular villain in the villains section  For example  Magneto will likely stay on the villains section even though he s led the Brotherhood on several occasions because he s fought the X Men many times on his own but characters like Toad  Destiny  Pyro  etc will not and just be linked to on the Brotherhood link  However  say  Sebastian Shaw will not be kept on villains section because he hasn t done anything while not being affiliated with the Hellfire Club  Also  as you have referenced  there are many villains included in the current list that have only appeared a handful of times or less  or not appeared in a major storyline  that I would like to remove  For example  does Lucifer really need to be included since he only appeared once  when he fought the X Men and it was revealed he was the one who crippled Xavier  I will work on this proposed template and place it up here when finished 68 49 68 231  talk  14 02  6 September 2009  UTC  Template Proposal  As promised  you can find my take on how to restructure the main template here  There will likely be more changes in the future when I ve reviewed things more  as there are with just about any restructuring  but I think this is a good base to start off with and would like to use this for the main template now that the others have been created 68 49 68 231  talk  15 45  6 September 2009  UTC  What if all the charcters were dropped like in   Avengers    and a simple members list was left   Sharp962  talk  17 14  6 September 2009  UTC   Well  I think that one only really works because it has all of the titles still in there as well  so users can go to the title that has the character they want  instead of searching the whole list  and we ve broken those X Men ones off in a separate template now  Having them all there is convenient to users who don t want to search a long list  and keeps down arguments of who deserves to be there and who doesn t  Plus  this template has had the character list up for so long  what s to stop others from trying to put them back up  I think this is just more convenient for users overall 68 49 68 231  talk  17 30  6 September 2009  UTC  I would like to get this finalized as soon as possible since this proposed split has been going on for almost a month and changing this template is the last thing left  so if there are no objections by tomorrow  I m going to slim down this template  and move ahead with the merges I ve proposed 68 49 68 231  talk  01 10  7 September 2009  UTC   edit  Members The members section is too long for the fact that we already have an article about it  I suggest trimming it and showing the more well known characters  Jhenderson777  talk  20 05  23 October 2009  UTC  I think that the members who re still actually members at the moment should be there  The extra squads that aren t really considered x men like most of the new mutants and the younger kids at the moment should be taken off    Mutantkingmagneto  talk  05 53  7 January 2010  UTC   edit  Brotherhood of Mutants I was just wondering since we can t seem to store the Brotherhood characters in this template  Maybe the characters are important enough for their own template  I am thinking if the group if the group is large enough to have their own members page they can have their own template  What is your thoughts  Jhenderson777  talk  18 01  19 February 2010  UTC  I d oppose that  The list is fine for purposes here  And there is another work around      J Greb  talk  22 16  19 February 2010  UTC  Which should be up now in a test size    J Greb  talk  22 47  19 February 2010  UTC  I totally agree  And I think what you did on the template is a really great idea  And probably need be done on other large templates such as Template Legion of Super Heroes for example  Jhenderson777  talk  00 07  2 March 2010  UTC   edit  New Mutants Do New Mutants count as X Men members too  I would understand if they didn t  But since you seem to let Dark X Men members count  One could never know  Jhenderson777  talk  23 03  1 May 2010  UTC  The general rule that has usually been followed is that secondary team members are usually not included because they usually have their own thing going on outside of the main X Men and usually under different leadership than someone at the school  Like X Factor used to be run by the government and now are their own detective agency  And X Force used to be run by Cable off on his own without having to work by the X Men s rules  However  most of the New Mutants are already included because they have been upgraded to X Men at some point  I think the only members who aren t on there are Cypher  Warlock  and Wolfsbane  It may be a good idea to have a vote on whether or not to add another column for secondary teams  but not adding the members of each team to keep the template size down  Though the main argument I could think of against them is that they are all likely linked to in the X Comics template since they re all their own books as well  As for the Dark X Men  they re only included if they ve been X Men or major villains in the past  The team was included since they factored into a major arc and had their own series  and were put into the miscellanea section when they debuted since they weren t considered real X Men or major villains at the time  Since they were last seen fully working under Osborn  they can probably be moved to villain teams now 68 49 68 231  talk  23 02  4 May 2010  UTC  I understand your reasoning  I also think of Tabitha Smith as another New Mutant character to mention  Jhenderson777  talk  00 19  5 May 2010  UTC  I am fairly certain that Boom Boom is at least a reserve member of the X Men as of Utopia  so I think she deserves a spot on the template   Preceding unsigned comment added by Todd landreth  talk   contribs  04 56  14 May 2010  UTC  Yep  Boom Boom is an official X Men member  not even just a reservist   per Marvel s Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z  vol  13 hardcover  And since I didn t really address the main question before  the New Mutants are no longer a separate team  it s been clearly established in the current New Mutants series and in Marvel s handbooks that Cannonball  under Cyclops as the current leader of all of the X Men  is now in charge of a squad of X Men that s informally referred to as the  New Mutants   They ve been called X Men repeatedly  they were the X Men s beta team at the beginning of the  Second Coming  storyline  and they re all listed as full members of the X Men in Marvel s handbook series  DeadpoolRP  talk  22 29  23 May 2010  UTC   edit  Adding Recent Members  etc  Okay  because I know these kinds of changes are sometimes considered  controversial  and are often quickly reverted  I m about to add some X Men members to the list on the template  so I m giving my reasons here first  So PLEASE do not revert any or all of this without similarly discussing your reasons here  And  just as an added note  for now I m not even going to add ALL of the current members  just members whose membership I can verify at the moment from multiple sources  First of all  I m adding Vulcan  Mystique  and Sabretooth  I realize that in the past the reason given for removing these characters was that they re also listed in the villains section  However  Magneto and Juggernaut have been listed in both places for a while now and no one has reverted it  so for the purpose of consistency  I m adding these three back as well  If anyone decides to remove them again  please either remove Magneto and Juggernaut as well or give your reasons here for not removing those two  Second  I m adding Magik  Cypher  and Warlock because  as I said above   it s been clearly established in the current New Mutants series and in Marvel s handbooks that Cannonball  under Cyclops as the current leader of all of the X Men  is now in charge of a squad of X Men that s informally referred to as the  New Mutants   They ve been called X Men repeatedly  they were the X Men s beta team at the beginning of the  Second Coming  storyline  and they re all listed as full members of the X Men in Marvel s handbook series   In case anyone needs the info  Magik officially joined the team in New Mutants  vol  3   1  2009  and Cypher and Warlock joined in New Mutants  vol  3   9  2010   And all of this information was verified by Marvel in Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z  vol  13  2010   Finally  I m adding Ariel to the list  She has similarly been confirmed an official X Men member in Marvel s handbooks  and she was made the teleporter for the X Men s alpha squad  as was Magik before her  during  Second Coming   further confirming her  and Magik s  status as full X Men members  Also  why is Xorn only on the list once  There were two separate Xorns on the team  and both members named Marvel Girl Phoenix are on the list  albeit each with their most recent codename   as well as both Thunderbirds  with parenthetical clarification   etc  Unless someone has VERY strong feelings about this and gives a good reason why we shouldn t  I think we should change Xorn to Kuan Yin Xorn and Shen Xorn  DeadpoolRP  talk  19 18  5 June 2010  UTC  Also  for those concerned about the list taking up too much space  my edits so far haven t made the list any larger  spacially speaking  however  there ARE several characters currently on the list who could be eliminated  To begin with  I propose removing Caliban and Nate Grey  since both have only been on substitute teams or sub groups  Caliban was only on the X Men s X Force strike team  and X Man was only on the 1999  Mannite Rescue X Men  in the second Astonishing X Men miniseries  though it looks like he ll probably be joining the main X Men team following  Second Coming   but that hasn t happened yet   Thoughts  DeadpoolRP  talk  20 36  5 June 2010  UTC  The double listings of characters has been discussed before  I know because I was a major part of it  It may have been in user talk pages or in edit summaries  since I don t see it on here anymore  but I know it was talked about it because I had some very long talks about it  I think Mags and Juggs were left on both since they skirted the line with long runs on both sides of the coin  We can go ahead and knock them both down to just villains  since that seems to be main side most people will remember them on  or we can keep them both on the side of good since Mags is now aligned with the X Men and Juggs is trying to go good again with the Thunderbolts  I ll keep them to the villains side  unless someone finds it necessary to move them back to the heroes  The New Mutants thing  I m actually working on something to put a listing for the secondary teams and work in a similar way to the Brotherhood listing  I m going to explain more in a new section  The argument for Ariel seems to draw a lot of parallels to when people argue about including M  As said on her page  Ariel volunteered to help out the X Men and not really said to being an actual member of the team itself  And much like M  just helping them out on occasion doesn t always mean that they are full X Men themselves  If just helping them out on a couple missions when they re available is enough to make someone an X Man  then the lists would would be a lot longer  And from what I m seeing on various talk pages  like the List of X Men members page and the Wikipedia Comics page  more users seem to be leaning towards not just going off of what the handbooks say and sticking to how things are stated in the comics themselves  I m fine with the Xorn change  Caliban has been considered an X Man since the Extremists arc of Uncanny during Ed Brubaker s run  I believe he may have had an X on his uniform when he went with them back to the tunnels  and he was included in the team list when they tried to restart the inclusion of the little heads in the upper left corner of the covers at that time  I believe he may have made a brief appearance with the team during one of the events going on at the time before Messiah Complex started  Either way  he s been with them before he was a part of X Force  This is an example of why we tend to not use the handbooks as sources since they obviously don t include his membership since the Extremists arc  Nate can stay too  since besides that mini  whenever I ve seen him reference in the books since then  he s always been considered a member 68 49 68 231  talk  01 37  6 June 2010  UTC  The villain switch you made is fine with me  I too remember seeing that discussion somewhere  and like I said  it just needed to be consistent one way or the other  all on both lists or all on one list  I think what a lot of people are missing is that Marvel has established in both their comics and in their handbooks that the X Men are no longer just a small ish   close knit group of heroes  Instead  they re now an expansive army with LOTS of members  as has been mentioned both by X Men members and by villains   In particular  the so called  New Mutants  are no longer just a group that s related to but not part of the X Men  they re full X Men members and shouldn t be in some kind of sub group section  They often work together as a squad  but as can be seen in several instances  Cannonball and Karma s recent involvement in several main X Men missions  Magik s inclusion in the alpha squad  Cannonball s leadership of the Hellbound squad  etc    they re  just  X Men like everyone else  I too got the impression that Caliban was going to become an X Men member when he appeared in the corner box of Uncanny X Men for one issue  but nowhere does it say a corner box appearance an X Man makes  Heck  villains have appeared in corner boxes before  Who knows  maybe the original plan was to make him a member of the team but then there ended up not being enough time before  Messiah Complex   his inclusion in X Force  and his death all happened  and they all happened right in a row  there was nothing between  The Extremists  and  Messiah Complex    But I just don t understand why a corner box appearance and helping the X Men find Masque  i e    helping them out on occasion   your words  makes Caliban an X Men member while helping out on SEVERAL missions and being included in the X Men s ALPHA SQUAD  not to mention being listed as a member in the handbook  as well as a status quo change demonstrated in story and explained in Marvel s official indexes and handbooks  isn t enough for Ariel  No offense  but it seems like you re making completely opposite arguments to suit your personal preference for each character  Marvel made the corner boxes as much as they made the handbooks  and it s their prerogative to interpret whether a corner box inclusion means membership or not   and if you only want to judge things based on in story references  then a corner box inclusion is no more  in story  than a handbook entry is  Now  if you reread  The Extremists  arc and find it clearly stated that Caliban s an X Men member  and maybe even if you just find an X on his uniform  though the Cuckoos and all of the other trainees have those and it isn t enough to make them full X Men   I might reconsider  But I don t think you ll find either of those things  Similarly  please give me one example of where Nate Grey has been called an X Men member in story during an X Men mission other than in the second Astonishing X Men miniseries  The only other time I can remember him even appearing with the team was in the Danger Room right before Astonishing X Men  when Professor X was announcing that the X Men were disbanding  not recruiting  So I m not sure why you can authoritatively decide that  Nate can stay too  based on what you remember of comics from 9  years ago  while my inclusion of members who are clearly stated in story to be members of the X Men s alpha and beta squads is called into question  Please tell me that you understand what I m saying here  DeadpoolRP  talk  02 54  6 June 2010  UTC  MY problem is that it seems redundant that characters are on the template more than once  Mystique and Magneto were already on there twice considering the Brotherhood subtemplate  Since characters like Mystique  Juggernaut  Magneto  and Xorn are more well known as antagonists of X Men than actual members it would be nicer if they are just in the villain sections  There is just too many villains on the members sections which are only members in certain circumstances  Jhenderson777  talk  19 58  6 June 2010  UTC  Magneto is currently a member of the X Men  Just so everyone knows  Preceding unsigned comment added by Eagle2ch  talk   contribs  08 41  2 August 2010  UTC   edit  Secondary teams One of the issues I ve seen recently regarding membership is how the various secondary teams fit in  like X Force and New Mutants  With the restarting of those teams and having them more closely related to the X Men then ever before  the line has become somewhat blurrier as to including them in the template as official members or not  So  I m working on putting up a section for the secondary teams  and to that we will work on putting in a similar set up for several of those teams like we currently have with the Brotherhood of Mutants  That set up is  while many of the Brotherhood members are well known  they haven t been relevant enough outside of the team as a single villain to warrant a separate inclusion on the list  but another user made a set up so that when you visit their page  they ll show up on the template with the incarnation of the team they re most known for  but not show up on pages other than those in that incarnation  It allows them to be included in the template  but keeps the size of the template down  which has been another big issue with this template in the past  A similar thing would be done with the secondary teams  It will allow characters like Warlock  Cypher  and Vanisher to be included in the template under those teams even though there s arguments that can go against them  It will draw a middle ground to hopefully make all parties happy  I ve already contacted user J Greb  who did the set up for the Brotherhood team  about this  and when I have a response from him  I hope to move forward with this  68 49 68 231  talk  02 29  6 June 2010  UTC  The training squad members included in the list  Anole  Blindfold  Cipher  Dust  Elixir  Gentle  Graymalkin  Hellion  Ink  Mercury  Prodigy  Rockslide  Surge  and Wolf Cub  are more of a secondary team than full members like the New Mutants  so I d say that they should be relegated to secondary status in the template before anyone else  And you d need to add the other trainees  Bling   Indra  Loa  Match  Onyxx  the Cuckoos  and Trance   But I think it d be fine to add X Club member  Yuriko Takiguchi and Kavita Rao  and X Force members  Wolfsbane  Caliban  Elixir  and Vanisher  who ve never been full X Men to the list in secondary spots  DeadpoolRP  talk   Preceding undated comment added 03 08  6 June 2010  UTC   Weird  why didn t that last comment auto date  Did I leave off a tilde or something  DeadpoolRP  talk  03 13  6 June 2010  UTC  The students that are already on the list are indeed X Men  The ones added during the run of New X Men were  as I was reminded on several occasions during arguments over it  called X Men on several occasions through Yost and Kyle s run  with the biggest specific mention happening during Messiah Complex  I believe  when Scott puts the kids against the Marauders  The Young X Men were in the same boat  after the first arc  when Cyclops decides to keep them together with Dani and Sunspot as their appointed leaders with him saying specifically that they won t be leading a teaching squad  but a fighting force  This is also when Sunspot has been considered being a full X Man and not just a New Mutant  68 49 68 231  talk  04 11  6 June 2010  UTC  Well  it s funny you should say that  because the  New Mutants  that are already on the list are indeed X Men  They have been called X Men on several occasions through their current series  with the biggest specific mention happening during Second Coming  I believe  when Scott sends them against Cameron Hodge and his forces and calls them the beta X Men team  So I guess we ll just have to keep both the trainees and the New Mutants on the main list  since they re given the same status in story  and Cannonball s squad is given higher status in the handbooks  a higher status that s clearly demonstrated in the confrontation between the two groups that happened in New Mutants  vol  3   1      DeadpoolRP  talk  16 09  6 June 2010  UTC  As I ve already posted elsewhere  if anyone needs more evidence that the  New Mutants  squad members are all full X Men  not a separate team  now  here s just one of many examples  a quotation from page 11 of last week s New Mutants  vol  3   15  September 2010   Cyclops  the current leader of all things X Men  says to Cannonball  the leader of the  New Mutants  squad of X Men    Take your X Men on a recreational leave  I want you gone by morning   This is just one of MANY examples throughout the series  as well as other X books  showing that the New Mutants are all X Men now  despite a lot of people on Wikipedia apparently not wanting them to be  Similarly  Domino and Boom Boom have been on the X Men for months now  so I m adding them to the template  Domino has been on both covert missions with the secret X Force squad AND open missions with the main  i e   NOT secret  thus NOT X Force  X Men  Boom Boom has been on several missions throughout the  Utopia    Nation X   and  Second Coming  storylines  including fighting against Predator Xs  Nimrods  Osborn s Avengers and X Men  etc   and both have been identified as X Men members by Marvel  DeadpoolRP  talk  02 41  26 July 2010  UTC  I ve added Box and Doctor Nemesis to the list based on several sources  They ve both attended Utopia s  core X Men members  meetings  in Nation X  1 and assorted Uncanny X Men issues   they ve both fought to defend Utopia against attacks  against Norman Osborn s Avengers and X Men in Dark Avengers Uncanny X Men  Exodus  against Emplate in X Men Legacy  etc    as opposed to just taking part in X Club research and missions  and both have been listed as core members in Marvel s handbooks  So if anyone feels the need to remove them from the list  be sure to discuss it here first  DeadpoolRP  talk  12 42  9 August 2010  UTC  I ve added the secondary teams article finally  but have not heard from the other user for putting up members lists like have been done for the Brotherhood on this template  As said in the edit summary  I ll remove this myself if I can not get it to work out 68 55 153 254  talk  21 06  17 July 2010  UTC   edit  Membership If you re going to list New Mutants and other affiliated mutants that were never officially X Men per se  then you should really just make the nav box bigger and include subsections for the secondary groups  i e  New Mutants  X Factor  Uncanny X Force  etc    I recently createda New Mutants Template that could easily be added as a sub group  Same could be done for X Factor and the other groups  We should really take a polll on this and come to some conclusion Vaf2675  talk  08 41  18 July 2010  UTC  I don t know what you mean by saying these characters were never members unless you just plain don t know about their history  But fine  I ll take it one by one if that will finally satisfy it  Caliban   Joined in the Extremists arc in Uncanny and stayed with them until his death in Messiah Complex  Chamber and Husk   The common thread in some of your arguments seems to be that if they were in previous teams  that they were never upgraded to X Men  which shows you just plain don t know or you re willfully ignoring it  Chamber joined somewhere before Uncanny X Men  400 and stayed with them until he went undercover in the Weapon X series and was used as a spy for them  still maintaining his contact with the team  Husk I don t know how you missed due to her rather controversial relationship with Angel during her tenure  joined around issue 422 of Uncanny  and after a few arcs where she was heavily featured  has appeared sporadically since the reload  but still as a member  since then  Changeling   Was given membership by Xavier himself when he asked him to mimic him while he left to prepare for the invasion he saw coming  This has never really been something that has been not taken as canon  Cloak  amp  Dagger   were made members after they turned their back on Osborne and his Dark X Men at the end of the Utopia crossover and were seen as members in the mini series with the Agents of Atlas  Deadpool   Was finally given membership at during a recent arc in his own series where he set out to join them  It was more a pity membership just so Cyclops wouldn t be bothered by it anymore from what I understand  but it s considered legit and canon by Marvel ever since  Karma  Mirage  Magma  Sunspot   Again  you need to look up more of their histories  Karma joined after Uncanny  500 when she helped to take down the Hellfire Cult and had been shown sporadically helping the X Men in various ways up through to the newest New Mutants book  Mirage joined after she left X Force when it turned to more of a black ops unit back around X Men  102 and had been said to have joined during the Six Month Gap  Magma was brief member of the X treme X Men during that series  which are considered official X Men like with Lifeguard and Slipstream  Sunspot joined when he took over as an instructor for the Young X Men during that series  short run  which would also add more to Mirage s credibility of being an X Man  As has also been told to you before  this current team of New Mutants ARE considered X Men in the books as they are the team that Cyclops gave Cannonball permission to gather as an field team of X Men  which would include Majik  Warlock  and Cypher  Petra and Sway   Yes  they are members  They may have died on their first mission  but they still died as X Men  Or would you want to not include the original Thunderbird  who died on one of his first missions too  All the students from New X Men and Young X Men   Yes  they actually are considered X Men  Through both the runs of their books  they are repeatedly referred to as the younger team of X Men and during Young X Men Cyclops even stated to Dani and Sunspot that he needed them to take over the leaders of this new team of X Men  And as far as the templates  what real purpose do they serve  I m trying to work with another user so that the secondary teams will be featured on this template much like the way the Brotherhood members are  They will appear on the template on their various personal pages  but not on others so as not to glut the template with all their names  That takes up their members part of what those other templates would offer  and everything else you have on there  story arcs and a history link  are already satisfied by the X Comics template  They re not necessary and only serve as something else someone can stick on a page just to have it there  68 55 153 254  talk  12 54  18 July 2010  UTC  There seem to be a lot of members missing and a lot of characters who are either inactive or dead currently in the list  I attempted to edit this but what I changed was changed back  and by edit this i don t mean I would remove those who are dead or inactive  but I think separating them from the current lineup would be helpful to avoid confusing  I find it quite odd that the lis on the actual x men page barely resembles the list of members on the Template eagle2ch  talk  1 49  2 August 2010 Eagle2ch  this is just a general list of X Men members with no regard to their current status  and lots of people are already complaining that the template is too large  So splitting the list into two lists  current and former members  is just going to make it even bigger  which is probably one of the reasons why your edits are being reverted  Also  you should always discuss major changes like yours here on the talk page and try to reach a consensus before actually making the changes  so the fact that you haven t been doing this  and you haven t even been putting much in your edit summaries   is probably another reason your changes were reverted  You should also read the talk page before making major changes to see if the kinds of changes you re about to make have already been discussed and decided on  If you had done that  you would have seen that the issue of villains and former villains has already been discussed several times  and it s been decided that if a villain is already on the template in the villains section and is better known as a villain  Magneto  Juggernaut  Sabretooth  Mystique  etc    they re left out of the X Men member list  This is another effort to keep the size of the template down  as well as to avoid repetition  I realize that there are still several members missing from the list  Aurora  Box  Danger  Fantomex  Doctor Nemesis  and possibly Hope Summers  though she may be considered part of the training squad  we ll have to wait and see   as well as some characters that are included in the list whose membership status is questionable  Caliban  Deadpool  Nate Grey  some training squad members   I ve been slowly adding members of the main X Men team to the list  but only when I have time to gather up enough evidence of their membership and present it here  because additions tend to be speedily reverted if they re not backed up on the talk page  due  I m sure  to the team s size   Members who ve only been on a temporary X Men squad  the Muir Island  Phalanx Invasion  and Mannite Rescue squads  for example  or an X Men sub group  Dr  Rao and Dr  Takiguchi of X Club  Wolfsbane and Vanisher of X Force  Onyxx  Bling   the Cuckoos  etc   of the training squad  for example  are generally left off of the list  though I m not worried enough about it to deal with the arguments that would result if I were to remove the training squad members currently on the list  New X Men  etc    On the other hand  the list on the main X Men page is a list of current members  and includes current sub groups   if you want a more extensive  detailed list  see the List of X Men members page  So  if after all that you still have changes you want to make  I d strongly suggest discussing them here on the talk page first and seeing what others think of your changes  especially if they re formatting changes   Or at least back them up here on the talk page before making them  especially if they involve adding to or removing from the characters on the list   I ll be sure to keep an eye on this talk page and address any of your comments when I get a chance  I hope all of this helps  DeadpoolRP  talk  20 23  2 August 2010  UTC  Bling   Trance  Loa  Indra  Stepford Cuckoos  Match and other X Men in training should be added becouse many of them took part in X Men mission  like Trance in Necrosha  Loa and Indra in Collision  Match in Utopia  Bling  in Utopia and versus Emplate  Onyxx in Utopia and Necrosha  No Girl in Nation X or Stepford Cuckoos in several misions in San Francisco and Utopia  And I think the same about Magneto  the group of Eve of destruction Frenzy  Omerta  Sunpyre  Wraith   Madelyne Pryor in the Fall of the Mutants and in Australia  Legion in Second Coming  Aurora in Secret Invasion  Mystique and Sabretooth in the team with Rogue  Iceman  Cannonball  Sentinel Omega and Lady Mastermind  Fantomex and EVA in New X Men vol 1  Nation X  Second Coming and Uncanny X Force  Vulcan in Deadly Genesis  Hope Summers in Second Coming and the Five Lights and Pulse in several times   Preceding unsigned comment added by 213 99 155 40  talk  16 44  27 August 2010  UTC  There are several problems with just about all those characters that have been discussed throughout the talk page  Some are already listed as villains which they are more known for than brief runs as heroes  Some were kidnapped or just happened to be there when they were attacked so of course they had to fight  which doesn t make them members  That and just flat out helping the X Men in general doesn t automatically make someone a member  If that were all it took  then half the marvel universe would be X Men 68 55 153 254  talk  23 19  27 August 2010  UTC  Okay  let s look at all of the characters you suggest  individually or in small groups  Bling   Trance  Loa  Indra  the Stepford Cuckoos  Match  and other X Men In Training  I believe that the official stance on these characters is that they re students and therefore not full members  so they get left off of the list like characters who are only members of the X Club  Dr  Rao  or X Force  Wolfsbane  Vanisher   However  there is some contention over this point  For example  all of the New X Men and Young X Men characters are on the list because some contributors argue that they re called  full X Men  in the comics and therefore belong on the list  I don t disagree strongly enough to remove them from the list myself and cause contention argument  but I also don t plan on adding the rest of the trainees myself  However  if you feel strongly about it  all you d have to do is find instances where they ve been specifically called  X Men   Trance in  Hellbound   Indra and Loa in  Collision   etc    Be sure to discuss it here before you add them to the template  citing specific issues  not just general storylines  like you ve been doing   etc   and I don t see how people can argue with you  as long as you discuss and source it thoroughly   considering all of the New and Young X Men characters already included       No Girl  Not all students are automatically X Men In Training  If they don t have uniforms  haven t been in training sessions and on mission  etc   like Ernst and No Girl  they definitely don t belong on the list  No Girl battling Kid Omega in a mental battle the X Men didn t know about beforehand doesn t count as being an X Man or taking part in an X Men mission  you know  Magneto  Juggernaut  Mystique  Sabretooth  Lady Mastermind  Vulcan  Kuan Yin Xorn  and Danger  All of these characters are already on the template  the first seven in the role they re better known as  villains  and Danger in the  Equipment  amp  Vehicles  section in her better known role as the Danger Room  The template s already big enough that we don t want characters on it twice   Actually  I misspoke  Lady Mastermind already is on the template as an X Men member since she hasn t been a significant enough villain to be in the villains section   The X Men group from  Eve of Destruction   Frenzy  Omerta  Sunpyre  Wraith   This X Men lineup  as well as the New Mutants Graduate X Men  Muir Island X Men  Phalanx Invasion X Men  Mannite Rescue X Men  and Street Team X Men  is considered a temporary substitute X Men group  so they don t have full membership status and don t go on the template  except for those members who have also been full X Men   Madelyne Pryor  Madelyne Pryor and Gateway have both been listed as X Men members in Marvel s handbooks  so I wouldn t be opposed to their inclusion  though it would have to be discussed and sourced first   However  now that I look back at the template  Madelyne s already on it as a villain  so she shouldn t be included in the members list too  Legion  It s as yet unclear what the official status of the Utopia residents who helped out during  Second Coming   Legion  Avalanche  Random  Scalphunter  Litterbug  Sack  and arguably Toad  etc   will be  According to Cyclops  they re X Men of some kind  but I m not sure if they re considered full members or just substitute members like the ones discussed above  I d wait to add them until we get some kind of clarification or see if any of them stick around and take part in future missions  Aurora  Yep  Aurora s a member and joined the team during  Secret Invasion   and she s been listed as a member in Marvel s handbooks  so I ll be adding her to the template eventually  In fact  I m going to add her right now  She was one of many new recruits who joined and battled alongside the team after it re formed in San Francisco  joining the team in Secret Invasion  X Men  2  2008   Her membership has been confirmed in several of Marvel s handbooks  including volume 13 of the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z hardcover series and the recent Women of Marvel handbook  And if you have any questions about the ability of handbooks to clarify events  and even add new information  as directed by Marvel s writers and editors  please read this entry in the handbooks  FAQs  http   marvel com universe OHOTMU 3AFAQ How do you go about writing each profile 3F As usual  I ve followed the preferred procedure here of explaining my changes before making them  so please do the same  citing sources  etc   if you want to change this  Fantomex and E V A   While these two were only substitute members when they were on the Street Team in New X Men  vol  1  I believe that like Boom Boom  Ariel  Domino  etc   with the X Men s current status quo  they ve qualified as full X Men members during the  Nation X  and  Second Coming  storylines  so I ll eventually be adding them as well  together as  Fantomex  amp  E V A    like  Cloak  amp  Dagger   so they re not on the template twice   Hope Summers and the  Five Lights   We ll have to wait and see if Hope  and the  Five Lights   are eventually classified as X Men In Training or full X Men  It s too early to add the Five Lights to the template  but it would be easy to justify Hope s inclusion since she s been on an X Men squad throughout the  Five Lights  storyline  and she even introduced the group by saying   We re the X Men   Just be sure to discuss it and cite it here before adding her  This week s Origins of Marvel Comics  X Men  1 has the following quote about Hope   After proving herself in battle  Hope watched her surrogate father make the ultimate sacrifice  then took her place with the X Men   So between that and the Uncanny X Men  526 quote above   We re the X Men    I m going to add her to the template  And there are some similar clarifying quotes about Magik  Cannonball  and the other New Mutants   Domino  and Jubilee being X Men members in the X Men Origins one shot  for those who still don t want to recognize them as full X Men       Pulse  Pulse was never called an X Man and has never been included on any X Men membership list  Sorry  He just came along with Mystique and helped out  which doesn t make him a member  Really the only way he d get added to the list is if a later writer specifically says in a story that he had been a member  or  obviously  if he joined the team at some future date   Thoughts comments differing opinions  DeadpoolRP  talk  02 46  30 August 2010  UTC  Okay  I m going to go ahead and add Fantomex and E V A  onto the membership list  As I mentioned above  I m going to follow the lead of how Cloak and Dagger  the other members who share a single Wikipedia page  were added by listing them together  however  I m not positive that that s the best way to list them  or Cloak  amp  Dagger   so I m open to suggestions  Anyway  my rationale for adding them  1   Fantomex has fulfilled all of the current requirements for X Men membership  per Marvel s handbooks and the explanation given in the X Men section of the recent Official Index to Marvel Universe series  He joined the X Men for a mission  in New York  against Sublime s associates   brought that squad back to Utopia  stayed on Utopia  and defended Utopia and San Francisco throughout the  Second Coming  storyline  Heck  he s fought alongside the X Men more than other current members  including Aurora  Boom Boom  Danger  etc  2   In Uncanny X Men  521  when Fantomex is transporting the X Men squad he assisted back to Utopia  he telepathically talks to Cyclops via Emma Frost and ends the conversation by saying  X Men  out   including himself with the group  3   If you look at the  main  cover of Uncanny X Men  522  every other character on the cover is an X Men member  with Rockslide being an X Men in Training member   so it seems odd to include Fantomex if he s not a member  4   Even before Cyclops s declaration during the  Second Coming  storyline that everyone on Utopia was a combatant and an X Man  Fantomex was already defending the island alongside the X Men  5   Fantomex has also joined Wolverine s new X Force squad  but since that team s a secret team  even from Cyclops    Fantomex s continuing exploits with the main X Men obviously can t be seen as X Force missions  6   Even after he joined X Force  Fantomex has continued his involvement with the X Men  including in the most recent issue of Uncanny X Men  where he and E V A  helped Emma Frost and Kitty Pryde sneak Sebastian Shaw off of Utopia  and he continues to appear prominently on the covers of upcoming issues  7   He got his own story in the recent X Men  To Serve and Protect  1 anthology  which ended with him telling the police that he was returning the diamond he and Batroc were fighting over  in the name of the X Men   All of these things point to his membership  Also  while I m adding things  I ll be adding two X Men secondary teams to the template  Generation X and X Terminators  Generation X members were official Xavier students who had their own series for 75 issues  and several of them have gone on to become X Men  Emma Frost  Chamber  Husk   And I know one contributor called the X Terminators  too minor  to include  but I don t really see why  In addition to  X Terminators  being the original superhero team name for the original X Factor lineup  the formation and training of the second X Terminators team  X Factor s young wards trainees  was a major subplot for most of the original X Factor team s run  They were to X Factor what the New Mutants were to the X Men  and they got their own miniseries and were prominently featured in a major X Men crossover   Inferno    And it s not like there s a shortage of space in the secondary teams section  So I m going to add them back to the list  at least until someone can explains in a bit more detail why they re too minor   Plus  the X Terminators page is pretty weak  so maybe linking to them in the template will get them more exposure and inspire someone to improve on that article   DeadpoolRP  talk  13 34  6 November 2010  UTC  I think after  Collision   X Men Legacy   238 241   it would be fair to include  at the least  Indra and Loa in the list right  Especially as they were given equal status in the arc as Anole  who is included  It would be a bit of a stretch to still classify them as just  X Men in Training  now that the two  especially Indra  are setup to play significant parts in the future as well   Preceding unsigned comment added by 59 95 36 152  talk  15 19  5 November 2010  UTC   edit  Dark X Men Just a heads up that I m changing  Dark X Men  in the template to  Norman Osborn s X Men   Since they were never actually called the Dark X Men in the comics  that was just the series name   this reflects both in story events and the way Marvel s handbooks have handled the team  DeadpoolRP  talk  01 01  20 September 2010  UTC  Cite error  There are  lt ref
