1953 until 1961  Prior to that he was a five star general in the United States Army  During World War II  he served as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe  he had responsibility for planning and supervising the invasion of North Africa in Operation Torch in 1942 43 and the successful invasion of France and Germany in 1944 45  from the Western Front  In 1951  he became the first supreme commander of NATO  2  Eisenhower was of Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry  and was reared in a large family in Kansas  by parents with a robust work ethic and religious background  As one of five sons  he was conditioned by a competitive atmosphere requiring self reliance  He was admitted to  and graduated from  West Point  and later was married with two sons  After World War II Eisenhower served as Chief of Staff under President Harry S  Truman  then assumed the post of President at Columbia University  3  Eisenhower entered the 1952 presidential race as a Republican  to counter the non interventionism of Senator Robert A  Taft  and to crusade against  Communism  Korea and corruption   He won by a landslide  defeating Democrat Adlai Stevenson and ending two decades of the New Deal Coalition  In the first year of his presidency Eisenhower deposed the leader of Iran in the 1953 Iranian coup d etat  and used nuclear threats to conclude the Korean War with China  His New Look policy of nuclear deterrence gave priority to inexpensive nuclear weapons while reducing the funding for the other military forces  the goal was to keep pressure on the Soviet Union and reduce federal deficits  When the Soviets launched Sputnik in 1957 he had to play catchup in the space race  Eisenhower forced Israel  the UK and France to end their invasion of Egypt during the Suez Crisis of 1956  In 1958 he sent 15 000 US troops to Lebanon to prevent the pro Western government falling to a Nasser inspired revolution  Near the end of his term  his efforts to set up a summit meeting with the Soviets collapsed because of the U 2 incident when an American spy plane was shot down over Russia and its pilot captured  4  On the domestic front  he covertly helped remove Joseph McCarthy from power but otherwise left most political activity to his Vice President  Richard Nixon  He was a moderate conservative who continued New Deal agencies  expanded Social Security and launched the Interstate Highway System  He sent federal troops to Little Rock  Arkansas  for the first time since Reconstruction to enforce federal court orders to desegregate public schools  and signed civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 to protect the right to vote  He implemented desegregation of the armed forces in two years  and made five appointments to the Supreme Court  He was the first term limited president in accordance with the 22nd Amendment  Eisenhower s two terms were peaceful ones for the most part and saw considerable economic prosperity except for a sharp recession in 1958 59  Although he left office in 1961 with low overall approval ratings  his posthumous reputation has grown and in recent surveys of historians  Eisenhower is often ranked as one of the top ten U S

Eisenhower family home  Abilene  Kansas The Eisenhauer  German for  iron hewer   family migrated from Karlsbrunn  Germany to Switzerland in the 17th century due to religious persecution  and a century later came to the United States  A misspelling in official documents changed their name  the Eisenhower family settled in York  Pennsylvania in 1730  and in the 1880s they moved to Kansas  5  Eisenhower s Pennsylvania Dutch ancestors  who were primarily farmers  included Hans Nikolaus Eisenhauer of Karlsbrunn who migrated to Lancaster  Pennsylvania in 1741  6  Hans  great great grandson  David Jacob Eisenhower  1863 1942   was Dwight s father  and was a college educated engineer  despite his own father Jacob s urging to stay on the family farm  Eisenhower s mother  Ida Elizabeth Stover  born in Virginia of German Lutheran ancestry  moved to Kansas from Virginia  She married David on September 23  1885 in Lecompton  Kansas on the campus of their alma mater  Lane University  David owned a general store in Hope  Kansas but the business failed due to economic conditions and the family became impoverished  The Eisenhowers then lived in Texas from 1889 until 1892  and later returned to Kansas  with  24 to their name at the time  David worked as a mechanic with a railroad and then with a creamery  7  By 1898  the family was self sustaining with suitable accommodations for their large family  8  Eisenhower was born on October 14  1890  in Denison  Texas  the third of seven boys  9  His mother originally named him David Dwight but reversed the two names after his birth to avoid the confusion of having two Davids in the family  10  All of the boys were called  Ike   such as  Big Ike   Edgar  and  Little Ike   Dwight   the nickname was intended as an abbreviation of their last name  11  By World War II  only Dwight was still called  Ike   5  In 1892 the family moved to Abilene  Kansas  which Eisenhower considered as his home town   5  As a child  he was involved in an accident that cost his younger brother an eye  he later referred to this as a experience teaching him the need to be protective of those under him  Dwight developed a keen and enduring interest in exploring outdoors  hunting fishing  cooking and card playing from an illiterate named Bob Davis who lived by the river  And though his mother was against war  it was her collection of history books that first sparked Eisenhower s early and lasting interest in military history  He persisted in reading the books in her collection and became a voracious reader in the subject  Other favorite subjects early in his education were arithmetic and spelling  12  His parents set aside specific times at breakfast and at dinner for daily family bible reading  Chores were regularly assigned and rotated among all the children  and misbehavior was met with unequivocal discipline  usually from David  13  His mother  previously a member  with David  of the River Brethren sect of the Mennonites  joined the International Bible Students Association  which later became Jehovah s Witnesses  The Eisenhower home served as the local meeting hall from 1896 to 1915  though Eisenhower never joined the International Bible Students  14  His later decision to attend West Point saddened his mother  who felt that warfare was  rather wicked   but she did not overrule him  15  In 1948  Eisenhower said he was  one of the most deeply religious men I know  though unattached to any  sect or organization   He was baptized in the Presbyterian Church in 1953  16  Mamie Eisenhower Eisenhower attended Abilene High School and graduated with the class of 1909  17  As a freshman  he injured his knee and developed a leg infection which extended into his groin and which his doctor diagnosed as life threatening  the doctor insisted that the leg be amputated but Dwight refused to allow it  and miraculously recovered  though he had to repeat his freshman year  18  He and brother Edgar both wanted to attend college  though they lacked the funds  They made a pact to take alternate years at college while the other worked  in order to earn the tuitions  19  Edgar took the first turn at school  and Dwight was employed as a night supervisor at the Belle Springs Creamery  20  Edgar asked for a second year  Dwight consented and worked for a second year  At that time  a friend  Swede  Hazlet was applying to the Naval Academy and urged Dwight to apply to the school  since no tuition was required  Eisenhower requested consideration for either Annapolis or West Point with his U S  Senator  Joseph L  Bristow  Though Eisenhower was among the winners of the entrance exam competition  he was beyond the age limit for the Naval Academy  21  He then accepted an appointment to West Point in 1911  21  At West Point  Eisenhower relished the emphasis on traditions and on sports  but was less enthusiastic about the hazing  though he willingly accepted it as a plebe  he was also a regular violator of the more detailed regulations  and finished school with a less than stellar discipline rating  Academically  Eisenhower s best subject by far was English  otherwise his performance was average  though he thoroughly enjoyed the typical emphasis of engineering on science and mathematics  22  In athletics  Eisenhower later said that  not making the baseball team at West Point was one of the greatest disappointments of my life  maybe my greatest   23  He did make the football team  and was a varsity starter as running back and linebacker in 1912  tackling the legendary Jim Thorpe of the Carlisle Indians that year  24  Eisenhower broke his leg in that  his last  game  it became permanently damaged on horseback and in the boxing ring  5  25  so he turned to fencing and gymnastics  5  Eisenhower later served as junior varsity football coach and yell leader  Controversy persists over whether Eisenhower played minor league baseball for Junction City in the Central Kansas League the year before he attended West Point  where he played amateur football  26  27  He graduated in the middle of the class of 1915  28  which became known as  the class the stars fell on   because 59 members eventually became general officers  Eisenhower met and fell in love with Mamie Geneva Doud of Boone  Iowa  six years his junior  while he was stationed in Texas  5  He and her family were also immediately taken with one another  He proposed to her on Valentine s Day in 1916  A November wedding date in Denver was moved up to July 1 due to the pending outbreak of World War I  In their first 35 years of marriage they moved as many times  29  Personal life Eisenhower  2nd from left  and Omar Bradley  2nd from right  were members of the 1912 West Point football team  The Eisenhowers had two sons  Doud Dwight  Icky  Eisenhower was born September 24  1917  and died of scarlet fever on January 2  1921  at the age of three  30  Eisenhower was mostly reticent to discuss his death  31  Their second son  John Sheldon Doud Eisenhower  was born on August 3  1922 while they were in Panama  John served in the United States Army  retired as a brigadier general  became an author and served as U S  Ambassador to Belgium from 1969 to 1971  John  coincidentally  graduated from West Point on D Day  June 6  1944  He married Barbara Jean Thompson on June 10  1947  John and Barbara had four children  Dwight David II  David   Barbara Ann  Susan Elaine and Mary Jean  David  after whom Camp David is named  married Richard Nixon s daughter Julie in 1968  Eisenhower was a golf enthusiast later in life  and joined the Augusta National Golf Club in 1948  32  He played golf frequently during and after his presidency and was unreserved in expressing his passion for the game  He had a small  basic golf facility installed at Camp David  and became close friends with the Augusta National Chairman Clifford Roberts  inviting Roberts to stay at the White House on several occasions  Roberts  an investment broker  also handled the Eisenhower family s investments  Roberts also advised Eisenhower on tax aspects of publishing his memoirs  which proved to be financially lucrative  32  After golf  oil painting was Eisenhower s second hobby  31  While at Columbia Eisenhower began the art after watching Thomas E  Stephens paint Mamie s portrait  He painted about 260 oils during the last 20 years of his life to relax  mostly landscapes but also portraits of subjects such as Mamie  their grandchildren  General Montgomery  George Washington  and Abraham Lincoln  33 Wendy Beckett stated that Eisenhower s work   simple and earnest  rather cause us to wonder at the hidden depths of this reticent president   A conservative in both art and politics  he in a 1962 speech denounced modern art as  a piece of canvas that looks like a broken down Tin Lizzie  loaded with paint  has been driven over it   31  Early military career See also  Military career of Dwight D  Eisenhower World War I After graduation in 1915  Lieutenant  2nd  Eisenhower put in for assignment in the Phillipines which was denied  and served with the infantry  initially in supplies  until 1918 at various camps in Texas and Georgia  In 1916  while stationed at Fort Sam Houston  Eisenhower was football coach for St  Louis College  now St  Mary s University  34  In late 1917 while in charge of training at Ft  Oglethorpe in Georgia  Mamie had their first son  When World War I began he immediately requested an overseas assignment but was again denied and then assigned to Ft  Leavenworth  Kansas  35  In February 1918 he was transferred to Camp Meade in Maryland with the 65th Engineers  His unit was later ordered to France but to his chagrin he received orders for the new tank corps  where he rose to temporary  Bvt   Lieutenant Colonel in the National Army  36  He trained tank crews at  Camp Colt  his first command at the site of  Pickett s Charge  on the Gettysburg  Pennsylvania Civil War battleground  Though Ike and his tank crews never saw combat  he displayed excellent organizational skills  as well as an ability to accurately assess junior officers  strengths and make optimal placements of personnel  37  Once again his spirits were raised when the unit under his command received orders overseas to France  this time his wishes were thwarted when the armistice was signed  just a week before departure  38  Completely missing out on the warfront left him depressed and bitter for a time  despite being given the Distinguished Service Medal for his work at home  In World War II rivals who had combat service in the first great war  led by Gen  Bernard Montgomery  sought to denigrate Eisenhower for his previous lack of combat duty  despite his stateside experience establishing a camp  completely equipped  for thousands of troops  and developing a full combat training schedule  39  In service of generals After the war  Eisenhower reverted to his regular rank of captain and a few days later was promoted to major  a rank he held for 16 years  6  The major was assigned in 1919 to a transcontinental Army convoy to test vehicles and dramatize the need for improved roads in the nation  Indeed  the convoy averaged only 5 mph from Washington  D C  to San Francisco  later the improvement of highways became a signature issue for Eisenhower as President  40  He assumed duties again at Camp Meade  Maryland commanding a battalion of tanks  where he remained until 1922  His schooling continued  focused on the nature of the next war and the role of the tank in it  His new expertise in tank warfare was strengthened by a close collaboration with George S  Patton and other senior tank leaders  their leading edge ideas of speed oriented offensive tank warfare were strongly discouraged by superiors who considered the new approach too radical and preferred the tank continue to be used in a strictly supportive role for the infantry  Eisenhower was even threatened with court martial for continued publication of these proposed methods of tank deployment  and he relented  41  42  From 1920 Eisenhower served with an unprecedented succession of generals   Fox Conner  John J  Pershing  Douglas MacArthur and George Marshall  He first became executive officer to General Conner in the Panama Canal Zone  where  joined by Mamie  he served until 1924  Under Conner s tutelage  he studied military history and theory  including Carl von Clausewitz s On War   and later cited Conner s enormous influence on his military thinking  saying in 1962 that  Fox Conner was the ablest man I ever knew   Conner s comment on Ike was    he  is one of the most capable  efficient and loyal officers I have ever met   43  On Conner s recommendation  in 1925 26 he attended the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth  Kansas where he graduated first in a class of 245 officers  44  45  He then served as a battalion commander at Fort Benning  Georgia until 1927  During the late 1920s and early 1930s Eisenhower s career in the post war army stalled somewhat  as military priorities diminshed  many of his friends resigned for high paying business jobs  He was assigned to the American Battle Monuments Commission directed by General Pershing  and with the help of his brother Milton  then a journalist at the Agriculture Dept   he produced a guide to American battlefields in Europe  He then was assigned to the Army War College and graduated in 1928  After a one year assignment in France  Eisenhower served as executive officer to General George V  Mosely  Assistant Secretary of War  from 1929 to February 1933  46  His primary duty was planning for the next war which proved most difficult in the midst of the great depression  47  He then was posted as chief military aide to General MacArthur  Army Chief of Staff  In 1932  he participated in the clearing of the Bonus March encampment in Washington DC  Although he was against the actions taken against the veterans and strongly advised MacArthur against taking a public role in it  he later wrote the Army s official incident report  endorsing MacArthur s conduct  48  49  In 1935 he accompanied MacArthur to the Philippines  where he served as assistant military adviser to the Philippine government in developing their army  Eisenhower had strong philosophical disagreements with his patron regarding the role of the Philippine Army and the leadership qualities that an American army officer should exhibit and develop in his subordinates  The dispute and resulting antipathy lasted the rest of their lives  50  Historians have concluded that this assignment provided valuable preparation for handling the challenging personalities of Winston Churchill  George S  Patton  George Marshall and General Montgomery during World War II  Eisenhower later emphasized that too much had been made of the disagreements with McArthur  and that a positive relationship endured  51  While in Manila Mamie suffered a life threatening stomach ailment but recovered fully  Eisenhower was promoted to the rank of permanent lieutenant colonel in 1936  He also learned to fly  although he was never rated as a military pilot  He made a solo flight over the Philippines in 1937  Eisenhower returned to the U S  in 1939 and held a series of staff positions in Washington  D C   California and Texas  In June 1941  he was appointed Chief of Staff to General Walter Krueger  Commander of the 3rd Army  at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio  Texas  He was promoted to brigadier general on October 3  1941  52  Although his administrative abilities had been noticed  on the eve of the U S  entry into World War II he had never held an active command above a battalion and was far from being considered as a potential commander of major operations  World War II After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor  Eisenhower was assigned to the General Staff in Washington  where he served until June 1942 with responsibility for creating the major war plans to defeat Japan and Germany  He was appointed Deputy Chief in charge of Pacific Defenses under the Chief of War Plans Division  WPD   General Leonard T  Gerow  and then succeeded Gerow as Chief of the War Plans Division  Then he was appointed Assistant Chief of Staff in charge of the new Operations Division  which replaced WPD  under Chief of Staff General George C  Marshall  who spotted talent and promoted accordingly  53  At the end of May 1942  Eisenhower accompanied Lt  Gen  Henry H  Arnold  commanding general of the Army Air Forces  to London to assess the effectiveness of the theater commander in England  Maj  Gen  James E  Chaney  He returned to Washington on June 3 with a pessimistic assessment  stating he had an  uneasy feeling  about Chaney and his staff  On June 23  1942  he returned to London as Commanding General  European Theater of Operations  ETOUSA   based in London  54  and replaced Chaney  55  Operations Torch and Avalanche General Eisenhower  In November 1942  he was also appointed Supreme Commander Allied  Expeditionary  Force of the North African Theater of Operations  NATOUSA  through the new operational Headquarters A E FHQ  The word  expeditionary  was dropped soon after his appointment for security reasons  The campaign in North Africa was designated Operation Torch  French cooperation was deemed necessary to the campaign  and Eisenhower encountered a  preposterous situation  with the multiple rival factions in France  His primary objective was to move forces successfully onto Tunisia  and intending to facilitate that objective  he gave his support to Fran ois Darlan as High Commissioner in North Africa  despite Darlan s fascist leanings  The Allied leaders were  thunderstruck  by this from a political standpoint  though none of them had offered Eisenhower guidance with the problem in the course of planning the operation  Eisenhower was severely criticized for the move  but Darlan was assassinated later that year  and Eisenhower s command position was not effected  56  The matter was a lesson learned for Eisenhower in terms of future communications with the Allied leaders  Operation Torch also served as a valuable training ground for Eisenhower s combat command skills  during the initial phase of Erwin Rommel s move into the Kasserine Pass  Eisenhower created some confusion in the ranks by some interference with the execution of battle plans by his subordinates  He also was initially indecisive in his removal of Lloyd Fredendall  He became more adroit in such matters in later campaigns  57  In February 1943  his authority was extended as commander of AFHQ across the Mediterranean basin to include the British 8th Army  commanded by General Bernard Law Montgomery  The 8th Army had advanced across the Western Desert from the east and was ready for the start of the Tunisia Campaign  Eisenhower gained his fourth star and gave up command of ETOUSA to be commander of NATOUSA  After the capitulation of Axis forces in North Africa Eisenhower oversaw the highly successful invasion of Sicily  Once Mussolini had fallen in Italy  the Allies switched their attention to the mainland with Operation Avalanche  But while Eisenhower argued with Roosevelt and Churchill  who both insisted on unconditional terms of surrender in exchange for helping the Italians  the Germans pursued an aggressive buildup of forces in the country   making the job more difficult  by adding 19 divisions and initially outnumbering the Allied forces 2 to 1  Nevertheless  the invasion of Italy was highly successful  58  Supreme Allied commander and Operation Overlord Eisenhower with U S  paratroopers of the 502d Parachute Infantry Regiment  101st Airborne Division on June 5  1944 In December 1943  President Roosevelt decided that Eisenhower not Marshall would be Supreme Allied Commander in Europe  In January 1944  he resumed command of ETOUSA and the following month was officially designated as the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force  SHAEF   serving in a dual role until the end of hostilities in Europe in May 1945  59  In these positions he was charged with planning and carrying out the Allied assault on the coast of Normandy in June 1944 under the code name Operation Overlord  the liberation of Western Europe and the invasion of Germany  From left  front row includes army officers Simpson  Patton  Spaatz  Eisenhower  Bradley  Hodges and Gerow in 1945 Eisenhower  as well as the officers and troops under him  had learned valuable lessons in their previous operations  and their skill sets had all strengthened in preparation for the next most difficult campaign against the Germans   a beach landing assault  Eisenhower s first struggles however were with Allied leaders and officers on matters vital to the success of the Normandy invasion  he argued with Roosevelt over an essential agreement with de Gaulle to use French resistance forces in covert and sabotage operations against the Germans in advance of Overlord  60  Eisenhower fought with Admiral Ernest J  King over King s refusal to provide additional landing craft from the Pacific  61  He also insisted that the British give him exclusive command over all strategic air forces to facilitate Overlord  to the point of threatening to resign unless Churchill relented  as he did  62  Eisenhower then designed a bombing plan in France in advance of Overlord and argued with Churchill over the latter s concern with civilian casualties  de Gaulle interjected that the casualties were justified in shedding the yoke of the Germans  and Eisenhower prevailed  63  He also had to skillfully manage to retain the services of the often unruly George S  Patton  by severely reprimanding him  when Patton earlier had slapped a subordinate and then when Patton gave a grossly errant speech  64  The D Day Normandy landings on June 6  1944 were costly but successful  a month later the invasion of Southern France took place  and control of the forces which took part in the southern invasion passed from the AFHQ to the SHAEF  Many prematurely considered that victory in Europe would come by summer s end  but Eisenhower knew from his German roots that the fight would continue  From then until the end of the war in Europe on May 8  1945  Eisenhower through SHAEF had command of all Allied forces  and through his command of ETOUSA  administrative command of all U S  forces  on the Western Front north of the Alps  He was ever mindful of the inevitable loss of life and suffering that would be experienced on an individual level by the troops under his command and their families  This prompted him to make a point of personally visiting every division involved in the invasion  65  Ike s sense of responsibility was underscored by his draft of a statement to be issued if the invasion failed  it has been called one of the great speeches of history  Our landings in the Cherbourg Havre area have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and I have withdrawn the troops  My decision to attack at this time and place was based on the best information available  The troops  the air and the Navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do  If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt  it is mine alone   66  Liberation of France and victory in Europe Eisenhower  amp  Allied Commanders at Rheims Surrender Once the coastal assault had succeeded  Eisenhower insisted on retaining personal control over the land battle strategy  and was immersed in the command and supply of multiple assaults through France on Germany  Gen  Montgomery insisted priority be given to his 21st Army Group s attack being made in the north  while Gens  Bradley  U S  12th Army Group   Patton  U S  Third Army  and Devers  U S  Sixth Army  insisted they be given priority in the south and near Paris  Eisenhower worked tirelessly to address the demands of the rival commanders to optimize Allied forces  often by giving them tactical  though sometimes ineffective  latitude  many historians conclude this delayed the Allied victory in Europe  However  due to Eisenhower s persistence  the pivotal supply port at Antwerp was successfully  albeit belatedly  opened in late 1944  and victory became a more distinct probability  67  In recognition of his senior position in the Allied command  on December 20  1944 he was promoted to General of the Army  equivalent to the rank of Field Marshal in most European armies  In this and the previous high commands he held  Eisenhower showed his great talents for leadership and diplomacy  Although he had never seen action himself  he won the respect of front line commanders  He interacted adeptly with allies such as Winston Churchill  Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and General Charles de Gaulle  He had serious disagreements with Churchill and Montgomery over questions of strategy  but these rarely upset his relationships with them  He dealt with Soviet Marshal Zhukov  his Russian counterpart  and they became good friends  68  The Germans launched a predictable and aggressive counter offensive in the Battle of the Bulge in late 1944 which was turned back in early 1945 by the ill prepared allies after Eisenhower repositioned their armies and improved weather allowed their bombers to engage  69  German defenses continued to deteriorate on both the eastern front with the Soviets and the western front with the Allies  As the defeat of the Germans became inevitable  Churchill and Roosevelt then began to shift their concern from the Germans to the Russians  the British particularly expected final surrender in Berlin ahead of the arrival of Russian forces  Though he was careful to restrict himself to military considerations toward completing a decisive victory over the Germans  Eisenhower at that time preferred a cooperative approach with the Russians  and displayed that in his decision as to the logistics of the Germans  surrender  The Germans finally surrendered on May 7  1945 at Rheims  France  70  Post World War II Military Governor and Chief of Staff General of the Army Dwight D  Eisenhower  Chief of Staff of the United States Army by Nicodemus David Hufford III  Following the German unconditional surrender  Eisenhower was appointed Military Governor of the U S  Occupation Zone  based in Frankfurt am Main  He had no responsibility for the other three zones  controlled by Britain  France and the Soviet Union  Upon discovery of the Nazi concentration camps  he ordered camera crews to document evidence of the atrocities in them for use in the Nuremberg Trials  He reclassified German prisoners of war  POWs  in U S  custody as Disarmed Enemy Forces  DEFs   Eisenhower followed the orders laid down by the Joint Chiefs of Staff  JCS  in directive JCS 1067  but softened them by bringing in 400 000 tons of food for civilians and allowing more fraternization  71  72  73  In response to the devastation in Germany  including food shortages and an influx of refugees  he arranged distribution of American food and medical equipment  74  His actions reflected the new American attitudes of the German people as Nazi victims not villains  while aggressively purging the ex Nazis  75  76  In November 1945  Eisenhower returned to Washington to replace Marshall as Chief of Staff of the Army  His main role was rapid demobilization of millions of soldiers  a slow job that was delayed by lack of shipping  Eisenhower suffered from a respiratory infection in December 1945 which prevented him from receiving the Order of the Elephant in person from King Christian X of Denmark  77  Eisenhower was convinced in 1946 that the Soviet Union did not want war and that friendly relations could be maintained  he strongly supported the new United Nations and favored its involvement in the control of atomic bombs  However  in formulating policies regarding the atomic bomb and relations with the Soviets Truman was guided by the U S  State Department and ignored Eisenhower and the Pentagon  By mid 1947  as East West tensions over economic recovery in Germany and the Greek Civil War escalated  Eisenhower gave up his hopes for cooperation with the Soviets and agreed with a containment policy to stop Soviet expansion  78  As the 1948 election approached  Eisenhower was repeatedly urged by prominent citizens from both parties nationwide to run for president  President Truman even approached him  offering to serve as his Vice President if he would agree to run as president on the Democratic ticket  Eisenhower maintained no political party affiliation during this time  though he was clear in not aligning with the Democrats  He firmly declined all of the offers and many believed he was foregoing his only opportunity to be president  Thomas E  Dewey was considered the other probable winner  would presumably serve two terms  and Eisenhower  at age 66 in 1956  would then be too old  79  President at Columbia University and NATO Supreme Commander The Supreme Commanders on June 5  1945 in Berlin  Bernard Montgomery  Dwight D  Eisenhower  Georgy Zhukov and Jean de Lattre de Tassigny  In 1948  Eisenhower became President of Columbia University  a premier private university in New York  The assignment was described as not being a good fit in either direction  80  During that year Eisenhower s memoir  Crusade in Europe  was published  81  Critics regarded it as one of the finest U S  military memoirs  and it was a major financial success as well  Eisenhower s stint as president of Columbia University was punctuated by his activity within the Council on Foreign Relations  a study group he led as president concerning the political and military implications of the Marshall Plan  and The American Assembly  Eisenhower s  vision of a great cultural center where business  professional and governmental leaders could meet from time to time to discuss and reach conclusions concerning problems of a social and political nature   Biographer Blanche Weisen Cook suggests that this period served as  the political education of General Eisenhower   as he had to prioritize wide ranging educational  administrative  and financial demands for the university  Through his involvement in the Council on Foreign Relations  he also gained exposure to economic analysis  which would become the bedrock of his understanding in economic policy   Whatever General Eisenhower knows about economics he has learned at the study group meetings   one Aid to Europe member claimed  Eisenhower accepted the presidency of the university to expand his ability to promote  the American form of democracy  through education  He was clear on this point to the trustees involved in the search committee  He informed them that his main purpose was  to promote the basic concepts of education in a democracy   As a result he was  almost incessantly  devoted to the idea of the American Assembly  a concept which he developed into an institution by the end of 1950  Within months of beginning his tenure as university president  Eisenhower was requested to advise Secretary of Defense James Forrestal on unification of the armed services  Approximately six months after his installation  he became the informal chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon  Two months later he fell ill and spent over a month in recovery at Augusta National Golf Club  He returned to his post in mid May  and in July 1949 took a two month vacation out of state  Because the American Assembly had begun to take shape  he traveled around the country in mid to late 1950 building financial support from Columbia Associates  an alumni association  Eisenhower was unknowingly building resentment and a reputation among the Columbia faculty and staff as an absentee president who was using the university for his own interests  As a career military man  he naturally had little in common with the academics  82  The contacts gained through university and American Assembly fund raising activities would later become important supporters in Eisenhower s bid for the Republican party nomination and the presidency  Meanwhile  Columbia University s liberal faculty members became disenchanted with the university president s ties to oilmen and businessmen  including Leonard McCollum  president of Continental Oil  Frank Abrams  chairman of Standard Oil of New Jersey  Bob Kleberg  president of King Ranch  H  J  Porter  a Texas oil producer  Bob Woodruff  president of Coca Cola  and Clarence Francis  General Foods chairman  As Columbia s president  Eisenhower gave voice and form to his opinions about the supremacy and difficulties of American democracy  His tenure marked his transformation from military to civilian leadership  The biographer Travis Beal Jacobs also suggests that the alienation of the Columbia faculty contributed to sharp intellectual criticism of him for many years  83  The Columbia trustees refused to accept his resignation in December 1950  when he took leave from the university to become the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  NATO   and was given operational command of NATO forces in Europe  Eisenhower retired from active service on May 31  1952  and resumed the university presidency  which he held until January 1953  NATO did not initially have strong bipartisan support in Congress at the time he assumed his command  Eisenhower unhesitatingly advised the participating European nations that it would be incumbent upon them to demonstrate their own commitment of troops and equipment to the NATO force before it would come from a war weary United States  At home  Eisenhower was more effective in making the case for NATO in Congress than the Truman administration  by the middle of 1951  American and European support for NATO was substantial enough to give it a genuine military force  Nevertheless  Eisenhower initially anticipated that NATO would be a truly European entity  with the American commitment ending after ten years or so  84  Presidential campaign of 1952 Main article  United States presidential election  1952 President Truman  symbolizing a broad based desire for an Eisenhower candidacy for president  again in 1951 pressed him to run for the office as a Democrat  It was at this time that Eisenhower vocalized his disdain for the Democratic party and declared himself and his family to be Republicans  85  A  Draft Eisenhower  movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non interventionist Senator Robert Taft  The effort was a long struggle  Eisenhower had to be convinced that 1  the political circumstances in the country had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate  and 2  that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their President  Henry Cabot Lodge who served as his campaign manager and others succeeded in convincing him  and in June 1952 he resigned his command at NATO to campaign full time  86  Eisenhower defeated Taft for the nomination  having won critical delegate votes from Texas  Eisenhower s campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan   I Like Ike   It was essential to his success that Ike express his opposition to Roosevelt s policy at Yalta and against Truman s policies in Korea and China   matters in which he had once participated  87  88  In defeating Taft for the nomination  it became necessary for Eisenhower to appease the right wing Old Guard of the Republican Party  his selection of Richard M  Nixon as the Vice President on the ticket was designed in part for that purpose  Nixon also provided a strong anti communist presence as well as some youth to counter Ike s more advanced age  89  1952 Electoral Vote Results In the general election  against the advice of his advisors  Eisenhower insisted on campaigning in the South  refusing to surrender the region to the Democrats  The campaign strategy  dubbed  K1C2   was to focus on attacking the Truman and Roosevelt administrations on three issues  Korea  Communism and corruption  In an effort to accommodate the right  he stressed that the liberation of Eastern Europe should be by peaceful means only  he also distanced himself from his former boss President Truman  Two controversies arose during the campaign which tested him and his staff but were without effect on the campaign  one involved a report that Nixon had improperly received funds from a secret trust   Nixon spoke out adroitly to avoid potential damage but the matter permanently alienated the two candidates  The second issue centered around Eisenhower s relented decision to confront the controversial methods of Joseph McCarthy on his home turf in a Wisconsin appearance  90  Just two weeks prior to the election  Eisenhower vowed to go to Korea and end the war there  He promised to maintain a strong commitment against Communism while avoiding the topic of NATO  finally  he stressed a corruption free  frugal administration at home  He defeated Democrat Adlai Stevenson in a landslide  with an electoral margin of 442 to 89  marking the first Republican return to the White House in 20 years  88  In the election he also brought with him a Republican majority in the House  by eight votes  and in the Senate  actually a tie  with Nixon providing the majority vote   91  Eisenhower was the last president born in the 19th century  and at age 62  was the oldest man to be elected President since James Buchanan in 1856  92  Eisenhower was the only general to serve as President in the 20th century  and the most recent President to have never held elected office prior to the Presidency   The other Presidents who did not have prior elected office were Zachary Taylor  Ulysses S  Grant  William Howard Taft and Herbert Hoover   Presidency 1953 1961 Main article  Presidency of Dwight D  Eisenhower Throughout his presidency  Eisenhower preached a doctrine of dynamic conservatism  93  He continued all the major New Deal programs still in operation  especially Social Security  He expanded its programs and rolled them into a new cabinet level agency  the Department of Health  Education and Welfare  while extending benefits to an additional ten million workers  He implemented integration in the Armed Services in two years  which had not been completed under Truman  94  His cabinet  consisting of several corporate executives and one labor leader  was dubbed by one journalist   Eight millionaires and a plumber   95  In 1956  Eisenhower faced Adlai Stevenson and Estes Kefauver on the Democratic ticket  Eisenhower won his second term with 457 of 531 votes in the Electoral College  and 57 6  of the popular vote  Interstate Highway System Main article  Interstate Highway System Remarks in Cadillac Square  Detroit President Eisenhower delivered remarks about the need for a new highway program at Cadillac Square in Detroit on October 29  1954Text of speech excerpt Problems listening to this file  See media help  One of Eisenhower s enduring achievements was championing and signing the bill that authorized the Interstate Highway System in 1956  96  He justified the project through the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 as essential to American security during the Cold War  It was believed that large cities would be targets in a possible future war  and the highways were designed to evacuate them and allow the military to move in  Eisenhower s goal to create improved highways was influenced by his involvement in the U S  Army s 1919 Transcontinental Motor Convoy  He was assigned as an observer for the mission  which involved sending a convoy of U S  Army vehicles coast to coast  97  98  His subsequent experience with German autobahns during World War II convinced him of the benefits of an Interstate Highway System  Noticing the improved ability to move logistics throughout the country  he thought an Interstate Highway System in the U S  would not only be beneficial for military operations  but be the building block for continued economic growth  99  Foreign policy Eisenhower held out an olive branch to the Soviet Union after Joseph Stalin s death in March 1953  100  but the Cold War escalated during his presidency  His foreign policy was marked by  the brave new world of CIA led coups and assassinations  It was Eisenhower whose CIA deposed the leaders of Iran  Guatemala  and possibly the newly independent Republic of the Congo  L opoldville   The Eisenhower administration also planned the Bay of Pigs Invasion to overthrow Fidel Castro in Cuba  which John F  Kennedy was left to carry out   101  Korean War  China and Taiwan Korean War In late 1952  Eisenhower went to Korea and discovered a military and political stalemate  Once in office he decided to resolve both stalemates by threatening to use nuclear weapons if China did not agree to a settlement  102  The National Security Council  the Joint Chiefs of Staff  and the Strategic Air Command  SAC  devised detailed plans for nuclear war against China  103  With the death of Stalin in early March 1953  Russian support for a Chinese hard line weakened and China decided to compromise on the prisoner issue  In July 1953  an armistice took effect with Korea divided along approximately the same boundary as in 1950  The armistice and boundary remain in effect today  with American soldiers stationed there to guarantee it  Throughout his terms Eisenhower took a hard line attitude toward China  as demanded by conservative Republicans  with the goal of driving a wedge between China and the Soviet Union  104  He continued Truman s policy of recognizing the Republic of China  based in Formosa Taiwan  as the legitimate government of China  not the Beijing regime  There were localized flare ups when the Red Army began shelling the islands of Quemoy and Matsu in September 1954  Eisenhower secured bipartisan Congressional support for the  Formosa Resolution  that gave Eisenhower the power to use military force  The Resolution boosted morale on Formosa  and signaled to Beijing that the U S  was committed to holding the line  As during the Korean War  Eisenhower openly threatened to use nuclear weapons  The shelling eventually ceased and the protection of Taiwan from an invasion remains a core American policy  105  Mideast and Eisenhower doctrine Eisenhower with the Iranian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi Even before he was inaugurated Eisenhower accepted a request from the British government to restore the Shah to power  He therefore authorized the Central Intelligence Agency to help the Iranian army overthrow Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh  106  In November 1956  Eisenhower forced an end to the combined British  French and Israeli invasion of Egypt in response to the Suez Crisis  Simultaneously he condemned the brutal Soviet invasion of Hungary in response to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956  Therefore he publicly disavowed his allies at the United Nations  and used financial and diplomatic pressure to make them withdraw from Egypt  107  Controversy surrounds Harold Macmillan  who met with Eisenhower on September 25  1956  then relayed to Prime Minister Anthony Eden the false impression that Eisenhower promised to support an invasion  108  109  In 1965 Eisenhower explicitly defended his strong position against Israel  Britain and France in his memoirs  110  Eisenhower and Vice President Richard Nixon with their host  King Saud of Saudi Arabia  Washington D C  in 1957 After the Suez Crisis the United States became the protector of unstable friendly governments in the Middle East via the  Eisenhower Doctrine   Designed by Secretary of State Dulles  it held the U S  would be  prepared to use armed force      to counter  aggression from any country controlled by international communism   Further  the United States would provide economic and military aid and  if necessary  use military force to stop the spread of communism in the Middle East  111  Eisenhower applied the doctrine in 1957 58 by dispensing economic aid to shore up the Kingdom of Jordan  and by encouraging Syria s neighbors not to consider military operations against it  More dramatically  in July 1958  he sent 15 000 Marines and soldiers to Lebanon as part of Operation Blue Bat  a non combat peace keeping mission to stabilize the pro Western government and to prevent a radical revolution from sweeping over that country  The mission proved a success and the Marines departed three months later  The deployment came in response to the urgent request of Lebanese president Camille Chamoun after sectarian violence had erupted in the country  Washington considered the military intervention successful since it brought about regional stability  weakened Soviet influence  and intimidated the Egyptian and Syrian governments  whose anti West political position had hardened after the Suez Crisis  112  Most Arab countries were skeptical about the  Eisenhower doctrine  because they considered  Zionist imperialism  the real danger  However  they did take the opportunity to obtain free money and weapons  Egypt and Syria  supported by the Soviet Union  openly opposed the initiative  However  Egypt received American aid until the Six Day War in 1967  113  As the Cold War deepened  Dulles sought to isolate the Soviet Union by building regional alliances of nations against it  Critics sometimes called it  pacto mania   114  Southeast Asia The French asked Eisenhower for help in French Indochina against the Communists  supplied from China  who were fighting the First Indochina War  In 1953  Eisenhower sent Lt  General John W   Iron Mike  O Daniel to Vietnam to study and  assess  the French forces therein  115  Chief of Staff Matthew Ridgway dissuaded the President from intervening by presenting a comprehensive estimate of the massive military deployment that would be necessary  However  it is now known that U S  Air Force pilots flew to support the French during Operation Castor in November 1953  In 1954  Eisenhower offered military and economic aid to the new nation of South Vietnam  116  In the years that followed  Eisenhower increased the number of US military advisors in South Vietnam to 900 men  117  This was due to North Vietnam s support of  uprisings  in the south and concern the nation would fall  116  In May 1957  Ngo Dinh Diem the President of South Vietnam  made a state visit to the United States for ten days  President Eisenhower pledged his continued support  and a parade was held in Diem s honor in New York City  Although Diem was publicly praised  in private Secretary of State John Foster Dulles conceded that Diem had been selected because there were no better alternatives  118  After the election of November 1960  Eisenhower in briefing with John F  Kennedy pointed out the communist threat in Southeast Asia as requiring prioritization in the next administration  Eisenhower told Kennedy he considered Laos to be  the cork in the bottle  in regards to the regional threat  119  Civil rights The Eisenhower administration declared racial discrimination a national security issue  as Communists around the world used the racial discrimination and history of violence in the U S  as a point of propaganda attack  120  The day after the U S  Supreme Court ruled in Brown v  Board of Education  1954   that segregated schools were unconstitutional  Eisenhower told District of Columbia officials to make Washington a model for the rest of the country in integrating black and white public school children  121  122  He proposed to Congress the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960 and signed those acts into law  The 1957 act for the first time established a permanent civil rights office inside the Justice Department and a Civil Rights Commission to hear testimony about abuses of voting rights  Although both acts were much weaker than subsequent civil rights legislation  they constituted the first significant civil rights acts since 1875  123  In 1957  the state of Arkansas refused to honor a federal court order to integrate their public school system stemming from the Brown decision  Eisenhower demanded that Arkansas governor Orval Faubus obey the court order  When Faubus balked  the president placed the Arkansas National Guard under federal control and sent in the 101st Airborne Division  They escorted and protected nine black students  entry to Little Rock Central High School  an all white public school  for the first time since the Reconstruction era  124  Relations with Congress Eisenhower had a Republican Congress for only his first two years in office  The Democrats gained a majority in the next election  He had to work with the Democratic Majority Leader Lyndon B  Johnson in the Senate and Speaker Sam Rayburn in the House  both of Texas  Joe Martin  the Republican Speaker from 1947 1949 and again from 1953 1955  wrote that Eisenhower  never surrounded himself with assistants who could solve political problems with professional skill  There were exceptions  Leonard W  Hall  for example  who as chairman of the Republican National Committee  tried to open the administration s eyes to the political facts of life  with occasional success  However  these exceptions were not enough to right the balance   125  Speaker Martin concluded that Eisenhower worked too much through subordinates in dealing with Congress  with results   often the reverse of what he has desired  because Members of Congress  resent having some young fellow who was picked up by the White House without ever having been elected to office himself coming around and telling them  The Chief wants this   The administration never made use of many Republicans of consequence whose services in one form or another would have been available for the asking   125  Judicial appointments Supreme Court Main article  Dwight D  Eisenhower Supreme Court candidates Eisenhower appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States  Earl Warren  1953  Chief Justice  John Marshall Harlan II  1954 William J  Brennan  1956 Charles Evans Whittaker  1957 Potter Stewart  1958 Whittaker was unsuited for the role and soon retired  Stewart and Harlan were conservative Republicans  while Brennan was a Democrat who became a leading voice for liberalism  126  In selecting a Chief Justice Eisenhower looked for an experienced jurist who could appeal to liberals in the party as well as law and order conservatives  noting privately that Warren  represents the kind of political  economic  and social thinking that I believe we need on the Supreme Court     He has a national name for integrity  uprightness  and courage that  again  I believe we need on the Court   127  In the next few years Warren led the Court in a series of liberal decisions that revolutionized the role of the Court  Eisenhower later remarked that his appointment was  the biggest damned fool mistake I ever made   128  Other courts Main article  Dwight D  Eisenhower judicial appointments In addition to his five Supreme Court appointments  Eisenhower appointed 45 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals  and 129 judges to the United States district courts  States admitted to the Union Alaska   January 3  1959 49th state Hawaii   August 21  1959 50th state Health issues Eisenhower was a chain smoker until March 1949  129  He was probably the first president to release information about his health and medical records while in office  130  On September 24  1955  while vacationing in Colorado  he had a serious heart attack that required several weeks  hospitalization  during which time Vice President Nixon took over executive duties  He was treated by Dr  Paul Dudley White  a cardiologist with a national reputation  who regularly informed the press of the president s progress  As a consequence of his heart attack  Eisenhower developed a left ventricular aneurysm  which was in turn the cause of a mild stroke on November 25  1957  This incident occurred during a cabinet meeting when Eisenhower suddenly found himself unable to speak or move his right hand  The president also suffered from Crohn s disease  a chronic inflammatory condition of the intestine  which necessitated surgery for a bowel obstruction on June 9  1956  He was still recovering from this operation during the Suez Crisis  Eisenhower s health issues forced him to give up smoking and make some changes to his dietary habits  but he still indulged in alcohol  During a visit to England he complained of dizziness and had to have his blood pressure checked on August 29  1959  however  before dinner at Chequers on the next day his doctor General Howard Snyder recalled Eisenhower  drank several gin and tonics  and one or two gins on the rocks     three or four wines with the dinner   131  The last three years of Eisenhower s second term in office were ones of relatively good health  Eventually after leaving the White House  he suffered several additional and ultimately crippling heart attacks  132  A severe heart attack in August 1965 largely ended his participation in public affairs  133  In August 1966 he began to show symptoms of cholecystitis  for which he underwent surgery on December 12  1966 when his gallbladder was removed  containing 16 gallstones  134  After Eisenhower s death in 1969  see below   an autopsy unexpectedly revealed an adrenal pheochromocytoma  135  a benign adrenaline secreting tumor that may have made the President more vulnerable to heart disease  End of presidency 1960 1961 Official White House portrait of Dwight D  Eisenhower  The 22nd Amendment to the U S  Constitution was ratified in 1951  and it set term limits to the presidency of two terms  It stipulated that Harry S  Truman  the incumbent at the time  would not be affected by the amendment  In 1961  Eisenhower became the first U S  president to be constitutionally prevented from running for re election to the office  having served the maximum two terms allowed  Eisenhower was also the first outgoing President to come under the protection of the Former Presidents Act  two living former Presidents  Herbert Hoover and Harry S  Truman  left office before the Act was passed  Under the act  Eisenhower was entitled to receive a lifetime pension  state provided staff and a Secret Service detail  136  In the 1960 election to choose his successor  Eisenhower endorsed his own Vice President  Republican Richard Nixon against Democrat John F  Kennedy  He told friends   I will do almost anything to avoid turning my chair and country over to Kennedy   88  He actively campaigned for Nixon in the final days and may have done Nixon some harm  When asked by reporters at the end of a televised press conference to list one of Nixon s policy ideas he had adopted  Eisenhower joked   If you give me a week  I might think of one  I don t remember   Kennedy s campaign used the quote in one of its campaign commercials  Nixon narrowly lost to Kennedy  Eisenhower  who was the oldest president in history at that time  then 70   was succeeded by the youngest elected president  as Kennedy was 43  88  On January 17  1961  Eisenhower gave his final televised Address to the Nation from the Oval Office  137  In his farewell speech  Eisenhower raised the issue of the Cold War and role of the U S  armed forces  He described the Cold War   We face a hostile ideology global in scope  atheistic in character  ruthless in purpose and insidious in method     and warned about what he saw as unjustified government spending proposals and continued with a warning that  we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence  whether sought or unsought  by the military industrial complex   He said   we recognize the imperative need for this development     the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist     Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals  so that security and liberty may prosper together   Because of legal issues related to holding a military rank while in a civilian office  Eisenhower had resigned his permanent commission as General of the Army before entering the office of President of the United States  Upon completion of his Presidential term  his commission was reactivated and Eisenhower again was commissioned a five star general in the United States Army  138  139  Retirement  death and funeral Eisenhower s funeral service Eisenhower retired to the place where he and Mamie had spent much of their post war time  a working farm adjacent to the battlefield at Gettysburg  Pennsylvania  In 1967  the Eisenhowers donated the farm to the National Park Service  In retirement  the former president did not completely retreat from political life  he spoke at the 1964 Republican National Convention and appeared with Barry Goldwater in a Republican campaign commercial from Gettysburg  140  However  his endorsement came somewhat reluctantly because Goldwater had attacked the former president as  a dime store New Dealer   On March 28  1969  Eisenhower died of congestive heart failure at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington  D C   The following day his body was moved to the Washington National Cathedral s Bethlehem Chapel  where he lay in repose for 28 hours  On March 30  his body was brought by caisson to the United States Capitol  where he lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda  On March 31  Eisenhower s body was returned to the National Cathedral  where he was given an Episcopal Church funeral service  That evening  Eisenhower s body was placed onto a train en route to Abilene  Kansas  His body arrived on April 2  and was interred later that day in a small chapel on the grounds of the Eisenhower Presidential Library  Eisenhower is buried alongside his son Doud  who died at age 3 in 1921  His wife Mamie was buried next to him after her death in 1979  141  Richard Nixon  then President  spoke of Eisenhower  Some men are considered great because they lead great armies or they lead powerful nations  For eight years now  Dwight Eisenhower has neither commanded an army nor led a nation  and yet he remained through his final days the world s most admired and respected man  truly the first citizen of the world  142  Legacy After Eisenhower left office  his reputation declined  He was widely seen as having been an inactive  uninspiring president compared to his vigorous young successor  Despite his unprecedented use of Army troops to enforce a federal desegregation order at Central High School in Little Rock  Eisenhower was criticized for his reluctance to support the civil rights movement to the degree which activists wanted  Eisenhower was also criticized for his handling of the 1960 U 2 incident and the international embarrassment  143  144  the Soviet Union s perceived leadership in the Arms race and the Space race  and his failure to publicly oppose McCarthyism  In particular  Eisenhower was criticized for failing to defend George Marshall from attacks by Joseph McCarthy  though he privately deplored McCarthy s tactics and claims  145  Such omissions were held against him during the liberal climate of the 1960s and 1970s  Since that time  however  Eisenhower s reputation has risen  In recent surveys of historians  Eisenhower often is ranked in the top 10 among all U S  Presidents  On June 1  1954  this signing ceremony changed Armistice Day to Veterans Day  Although conservatism in politics was strong during the 1950s and Eisenhower generally shared these sentiments  his administration concerned itself mostly with foreign affairs  an area that the career military president was more knowledgeable about  and pursued a hands off domestic policy  Eisenhower looked to moderation and cooperation as a means of governance  146  Although he sought to slow or contain the New Deal and other federal programs  he did not attempt to repeal them outright and in doing so was popular among the liberal wing of the Republican Party  146  Conservative critics of his administration found that he did not do enough to advance the goals of the right   Eisenhower s victories were   according to Hans Morgenthau   but accidents without consequence in the history of the Republican party   147  Eisenhower was the first President to hire a White House Chief of Staff or  gatekeeper    an idea which he borrowed from the United States Army  Every president after Lyndon Johnson has also appointed staff to this position  Initially  Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter tried to operate without a Chief of Staff but both eventually appointed one  Eisenhower founded People to People International in 1956  based on his belief that citizen interaction would promote cultural interaction and world peace  The program includes a student ambassador component which sends American youth on educational trips to other countries  148  Eisenhower described his position on space and the need for peace during his speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations  New York City  September 22  1960  The emergence of this new world poses a vital issue  will outer space be preserved for peaceful use and developed for the benefit of all mankind  Or will it become another focus for the arms race   and thus an area of dangerous and sterile competition  The choice is urgent  And it is ours to make  The nations of the world have recently united in declaring the continent of Antarctica  off limits  to military preparations  We could extend this principle to an even more important sphere  National vested interests have not yet been developed in space or in celestial bodies  Barriers to agreement are now lower than they will ever be again  149  On the whole  Eisenhower s support of the embryonic space program was lukewarm and his administration s lack of interest partially led to the Soviet Union beating out the US in putting a satellite in space  Eisenhower warned about the emerging military industrial complex in his Chance for Peace Speech  Every gun that is made  every warship launched  every rocket fired signifies  in the final sense  a theft from those who hunger and are not fed  those who are cold and are not clothed  This world in arms is not spending money alone  It is spending the sweat of its laborers  the genius of its scientists  the hopes of its children  The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this  a modern brick school in more than 30 cities  It is two electric power plants  each serving a town of 60 000 population  It is two fine  fully equipped hospitals  It is some fifty miles of concrete pavement  We pay for a single fighter plane with a half million bushels of wheat  We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8 000 people  This is  I repeat  the best way of life to be found on the road the world has been taking  This is not a way of life at all  in any true sense  Under the cloud of threatening war  it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron      Is there no other way the world may live  150  Eisenhower was the first president to appear on color television  He was videotaped when he spoke at the dedication of WRC TV s new studios in Washington  D C   on May 21  1958  Tributes and memorials Eisenhower is
