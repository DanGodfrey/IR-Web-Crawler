Monocondylia Archaeognatha  Coxoplectoptera Dicondylia Pterygota Insects  from Latin insectum  a calque of Greek           ntomon    cut into sections   are a class of living creatures within the arthropods that have a chitinous exoskeleton  a three part body  head  thorax  and abdomen   three pairs of jointed legs  compound eyes  and two antennae  They are among the most diverse groups of animals on the planet  including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms  2  3  The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million  2  4  5  and potentially represent over 90  of the differing metazoan life forms on Earth  6  Insects may be found in nearly all environments  although only a small number of species occur in the oceans  a habitat dominated by another arthropod group  the crustaceans  The life cycles of insects vary but most hatch from eggs  Insect growth is constrained by the inelastic exoskeleton and development involves a series of molts  The immature stages can differ from the adults in structure  habit and habitat and can include a passive pupal stage in those groups that undergo complete metamorphosis  Insects that undergo incomplete metamorphosis lack a pupal stage and adults develop through a series of nymphal stages  7  The higher level relationship of the hexapoda is unclear  Fossilized insects of enormous size have been found from the Paleozoic Era  including giant dragonflies with wingspans of 55 to 70 cm  22 28 in   The most diverse insect groups appear to have coevolved with flowering plants  Insects typically move about by walking  flying or occasionally swimming  As it allows for rapid yet stable movement  many insects adopt a tripedal gait in which they walk with their legs touching the ground in alternating triangles  Insects are the only invertebrates to have evolved flight  Many insects spend at least part of their life underwater  with larval adaptations that include gills and some adult insects are aquatic and have adaptations for swimming  Some species  like water striders  are capable of walking on the surface of water  Insects are mostly solitary  but some insects  such as certain bees  ants  and termites are social and live in large  well organized colonies  Some insects  like earwigs  show maternal care  guarding their eggs and young  Insects can communicate with each other in a variety of ways  Male moths can sense the pheromones of female moths over distances of many kilometers  Other species communicate with sounds  crickets stridulate  or rub their wings together  to attract a mate and repel other males  Lampyridae in the beetle order Coleoptera communicate with light  Humans regard certain insects as pests and attempt to control them using insecticides and a host of other techniques  Some insects damage crops by feeding on sap  leaves or fruits  a few bite humans and livestock  alive and dead  to feed on blood and some are capable of transmitting diseases to humans  pets and livestock  Nevertheless  without insects to pollinate flowers  the human race would soon run out of food because many of the crop plants that we rely on would not be able to reproduce  8  Many other insects are considered ecologically beneficial as predators and a few provide direct economic benefit  Silkworms and bees have been used extensively by humans for the production of silk and honey  respectively  Contents 1 Etymology 2 Distribution and diversity 3 Morphology and physiology 3 1 External 3 2 Segmentation 3 2

divided body   literally  cut into   from neuter plural of insectare  to cut into  to cut up   from in   into    secare  to cut   9  from the fact that insects are  cut into  three sections  The word created by Pliny the Elder s loan translation of the Greek word         or  insect   as in entomology   which was Aristotle s term for this class of life  also in reference to their  notched  bodies  first documented in English in 1601 in Holland s translation of Pliny  Translations of Aristotle s term also form the usual word for  insect  in Welsh  trychfil  from trychu  cut    mil  animal    Serbo Croatian  zareznik  from rezati  cut    Russian            nasekomoe  from sekat  cut    etc  9   edit  Distribution and diversity Even though the true dimensions of species diversity remain uncertain  estimates are ranging from 1 4 to 1 8 million species  This probably represents less than 20  of all species on Earth  and with only about 20 000 new species of all organisms being described each year  it seems that most species will remain undescribed for many years unless there is a rapid increase in species descriptions  About 850 000 1 000 000 of all described species are insects  Of the 30 or so orders of insects  four dominate in terms of numbers of described species  with an estimated 600 000 795 000 species include Coleoptera  Diptera  Hymenoptera  and Lepidoptera

mouthparts   Insects have segmented bodies supported by an exoskeleton  a hard outer covering made mostly of chitin  The segments of the body are organized into three distinctive but interconnected units  or tagmata  a head  a thorax  and an abdomen  10  The head supports a pair of sensory antennae  a pair of compound eyes  and  if present  one to three simple eyes  or ocelli  and three sets of variously modified appendages that form the mouthparts  The thorax has six segmented legs one pair each for the prothorax  mesothorax and the metathorax segments making up the thorax and  if present in the species  two or four wings  The abdomen consists of eleven segments  though in a few species of insects these segments may be fused together or reduced in size  The abdomen also contains most of the digestive  respiratory  excretory and reproductive internal structures  11  22 48 There is considerable variation and many adaptations in the body parts of insects especially wings  legs  antenna  mouth parts etc   edit  Segmentation The head  is enclosed in a hard  heavily sclerotized  unsegmented  exoskeletal head capsule  or epicranium  which contains most of the sensing organs  including the antennae  ocellus or eyes  and the mouthparts  Out of all the insect orders  Orthoptera displays the most features found in other insects  including the sutures and sclerites  12  here  the vertex  or the apex  dorsal region   is situated between the compound eyes for insects with a hypognathous and opisthognathous head  In prognathous insects  the vertex is not found between the compound eyes  but rather  where the ocelli are normally  This is because the primary axis of the head is rotated 90 degrees to become parallel to the primary axis of the body  In some species this region is modified and assumes a different name  12  13 The thorax  is a segment composed of three sections  the prothorax  mesothorax  and the metathorax  The anterior segment  closest to the head  is the prothorax  with the major features being the first pair of legs and the pronotum  The middle segment is the mesothorax with the major features being the second pair of legs and the anterior wings  The third and most posterior segment  abutting the abdomen  is the metathorax  which features the third pair of legs and the posterior wings  Each segment is dilineated by an intersegmental suture  Each segment has four basic regions  The dorsal surface is called the tergum  or notum  to distinguish them from the abdominal terga  11  The two lateral regions are called the pleura  singular  pleuron  and the ventral aspect is called the sternum  In turn  the notum of the prothorax is called the pronotum  the notum for the mesothorax is called the mesonotum and the notum for the metathorax is called the metanotum  Continuing with this logic  there is also the mesopleura and metapleura as well as the mesosternum and metasternum  12  The abdomen  is a the last segment of the insect  which typically consists of 11 12 segments and is less strongly sclerotized than the head or thorax  Each segment of the abdomen is represented by a sclerotized tergum  sternum  and perhaps a pleurite  Terga are separated from each other and from the adjacent sterna or pleura by a membrane  Spiracles are located in the pleural area  Variation of this ground plan includes the fusion of terga or terga and sterna to form continuous dorsal or ventral shields or a conical tube  Some insects bear a sclerite in the pleural area called a laterotergite  Ventral sclerites are sometimes called laterosternites  During the embryonic stage of many insects and the postembryonic stage of primitive insects  11 abdominal segments are present  In modern insects there is a tendency toward reduction in the number of the abdominal segments  but the primitive number of 11 is maintained during embryogenesis Variation in abdominal segment number is considerable  If the Apterygota are considered to be indicative of the ground plan for pterygotes  confusion reigns  adult Protura have 12 segments  Collembola have 6  The orthopteran family Acrididae has 11 segments  and a fossil specimen of Zoraptera has a 10 segmented abdomen  12   edit  Exoskeleton The insect outer skeleton  the cuticle  is made up of two layers  the epicuticle  which is a thin and waxy water resistant outer layer and contains no chitin  and a lower layer called the procuticle  The procuticle is chitinous and much thicker than the epicuticle and has two layers  an outer layer known as the exocuticle and an inner layer known as the endocuticle  The tough and flexible endocuticle is built from numerous layers of fibrous chitin and proteins  criss crossing each others in a sandwich pattern  while the exocuticle is rigid and hardened  11  22 24 The exocuticle is greatly reduced in many soft bodied insects  e g   caterpillars   especially during their larval stages  Insects are the only invertebrates to have developed active flight capability  and this has played an important role in their success  11  186 Their muscles are able to contract multiple times for each single nerve impulse  allowing the wings to beat faster than would ordinarily be possible  Having their muscles attached to their exoskeletons is more efficient and allows more muscle connections  crustaceans also use the same method  though all spiders use hydraulic pressure to extend their legs  a system inherited from their pre arthropod ancestors  Unlike insects  though  most aquatic crustaceans are biomineralized with calcium carbonate extracted from the water  13  14   edit  Internal  edit  Nervous system The nervous system of an insect can be divided into a brain and a ventral nerve cord  The head capsule is made up of six fused segments  each with a pair of ganglia  or a cluster of nerve cells outside of the brain  The first three pairs of ganglia are fused into the brain  while the three following pairs are fused into a structure of three pairs of ganglia under the insect s esophagus  called the subesophageal ganglion  11  57 The thoracic segments have one ganglion on each side  which are connected into a pair  one pair per segment  This arrangement is also seen in the abdomen but only in the first eight segments  Many species of insects have reduced numbers of ganglia due to fusion or reduction  15  Some cockroaches have just six ganglia in the abdomen  whereas the wasp Vespa crabro has only two in the thorax and three in the abdomen  Some insects  like the house fly Musca domestica  have all the body ganglia fused into a single large thoracic ganglion  At least a few insects have nociceptors  cells that detect and transmit sensations of pain  16  This was discovered in 2003 by studying the variation in reactions of larvae of the common fruitfly Drosophila to the touch of a heated probe and an unheated one  The larvae reacted to the touch of the heated probe with a stereotypical rolling behavior that was not exhibited when the larvae were touched by the unheated probe  17  Although nociception has been demonstrated in insects  there is not a consensus that insects feel pain consciously 18  but see Pain in invertebrates   edit  Digestive system An insect uses its digestive system to extract nutrients and other substances from the food it consumes  19  Most of this food is ingested in the form of macromolecules and other complex substances like proteins  polysaccharides  fats  and nucleic acids  These macromolecules must be broken down by catabolic reactions into smaller molecules like amino acids and simple sugars before being used by cells of the body for energy  growth  or reproduction  This break down process is known as digestion  The main structure of an insect s digestive system is a long enclosed tube called the alimentary canal  which runs lengthwise through the body  The alimentary canal directs food unidirectionally from the mouth to the anus  It has three sections  each of which performs a different process of digestion  In addition to the alimentary canal  insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs  These structures usually reside in the thorax  adjacent to the foregut  11  70 77 The salivary glands  element 30 in numbered diagram  in an insect s mouth produce saliva  The salivary ducts lead from the glands to the reservoirs and then forward through the head to an opening called the salivarium  located behind the hypopharynx  By moving its mouthparts  element 32 in numbered diagram  the insect can mix its food with saliva  The mixture of saliva and food then travels through the salivary tubes into the mouth  where it begins to break down  19  20  Some insects  like flies  have extra oral digestion  Insects using extra oral digestion expel digestive enzymes onto their food to break it down  This strategy allows insects to extract a significant proportion of the available nutrients from the food source  21  31 The gut is where almost all of insects  digestion takes place  It can be divided into the foregut  midgut and hindgut   edit  Foregut Stylized diagram of insect digestive tract showing malpighian tubule  from an insect of the order Orthoptera  The first section of the alimentary canal is the foregut  element 27 in numbered diagram   or stomodaeum  The foregut is lined with a cuticular lining made of chitin and proteins as protection from tough food  The foregut includes the buccal cavity  mouth   pharynx  esophagus  and Crop and proventriculus  any part may be highly modified  which both store food and signify when to continue passing onward to the midgut  11  70 Digestion starts in buccal cavity  mouth  as partially chewed food is broken down by saliva from the salivary glands  As the salivary glands produce fluid and carbohydrate digesting enzymes  mostly amylases   strong muscles in the pharynx pump fluid into the buccal cavity  lubricating the food like the salivarium does  and helping blood feeders  and xylem and phloem feeders  From there  the pharynx passes food to the esophagus  which could be just a simple tube passing it on to the crop and proventriculus  and then onward to the midgut  as in most insects  Alternately  the foregut may expand into a very enlarged crop and proventriculus  or the crop could just be a diverticulum  or fluid filled structure  as in some Diptera species  21  30 31 Bumblebee defecating  Note the contraction of the anus which provides internal pressure   edit  Midgut Once food leaves the crop  it passes to the midgut  element 13 in numbered diagram   also known as the mesenteron  where the majority of digestion takes place  Microscopic projections from the midgut wall  called microvilli  increase the surface area of the wall and allow more nutrients to be absorbed  they tend to be close to the origin of the midgut  In some insects  the role of the microvilli and where they are located may vary  For example  specialized microvilli producing digestive enzymes may more likely be near the end of the midgut  and absorption near the origin or beginning of the midgut  21  32  edit  Hindgut In the hindgut  element 16 in numbered diagram   or proctodaeum  undigested food particles are joined by uric acid to form fecal pellets  The rectum absorbs 90  of the water in these fecal pellets  and the dry pellet is then eliminated through the anus  element 17   completing the process of digestion  The uric acid is formed using hemolymph waste products diffused from the Malpighian tubules  element 20   It is then emptied directly into the alimentary canal  at the junction between the midgut and hindgut  The number of Malpighian tubules possessed by a given insect varies between species  ranging from only two tubules in some insects to over 100 tubules in others  11  71 72  78 80  edit  Endocrine system The salivary glands  element 30 in numbered diagram  in an insect s mouth produce saliva  The salivary ducts lead from the glands to the reservoirs and then forward through the head to an opening called the salivarium  located behind the hypopharynx  By moving its mouthparts  element 32 in numbered diagram  the insect can mix its food with saliva  The mixture of saliva and food then travels through the salivary tubes into the mouth  where it begins to break down  19  20  Some insects  like flies  have extra oral digestion  Insects using extra oral digestion expel digestive enzymes onto their food to break it down  This strategy allows insects to extract a significant proportion of the available nutrients from the food source  21  31  edit  Reproductive system The reproductive system of female insects consist of a pair of ovaries  accessory glands  one or more spermathecae  and ducts connecting these parts  The ovaries are made up of a number of egg tubes  called ovarioles  which vary in size and number by species  The number of eggs that the insect is able to make vary by the number of ovarioles with the rate that eggs can be develop being also influenced by ovariole design  Female insects are able make eggs  receive and store sperm  manipulate sperm from different males  and lay eggs  Accessory glands or glandular parts of the oviducts produce a variety of substances for sperm maintenance  transport  and fertilization  as well as for protection of eggs  They can produce glue and protective substances for coating eggs or tough coverings for a batch of eggs called oothecae  Spermathecae are tubes or sacs in which sperm can be stored between the time of mating and the time an egg is fertilized   12  880 For males  the reproductive system is the testis  suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body  Most male insects have a pair of testes  inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac  The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens  and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct that leads to the outside  A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the seminal vesicle  which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female  The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm  The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and  as a result  has a cuticular lining  The terminal portion of the ejaculatory duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ  the aedeagus  The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm  except for the germ cells  or spermatogonia  which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during embryogenesis  12  885  edit  Respiratory and circulatory systems Insect respiration is accomplished without lungs  Instead  the insect respiratory system uses a system of internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped  delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their trachea  element 8 in numbered diagram   Since oxygen is delivered directly  the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen  and is therefore greatly reduced  The insect circulatory system has no veins or arteries  and instead consists of little more than a single  perforated dorsal tube which pulses peristaltically  Toward the thorax  the dorsal tube  element 14  divides into chambers and acts like the insect s heart  The opposite end of the dorsal tube is like the aorta of the insect circulating the hemolymph  arthropods  fluid analog of blood  inside the body cavity  11  61 65 22  Air is taken in through openings on the sides of the abdomen called spiracles  There are many different patterns of gas exchange demonstrated by different groups of insects  Gas exchange patterns in insects can range from continuous and diffusive ventilation  to discontinuous gas exchange  11  65 68 During continuous gas exchange  oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is released in a continuous cycle  In discontinuous gas exchange  however  the insect takes in oxygen while it is active and small amounts of carbon dioxide are released when the insect is at rest  23  Diffusive ventilation is simply a form of continuous gas exchange that occurs by diffusion rather than physically taking in the oxygen  Some species of insect that are submerged also have adaptations to aid in respiration  As larvae  many insects have gills that can extract oxygen dissolved in water  while others need to rise to the water surface to replenish air supplies which may be held or trapped in special structures  24  25   edit  Reproduction and development A pair of Simosyrphus grandicornis hoverflies mating in flight  The majority of insects hatch from eggs  but not all insects lay eggs  an example of an insect that can give birth to live young is the Aphid   The fertilization and development takes place inside the egg  enclosed by a shell  chorion   Some species of insects  like the cockroach Blaptica dubia  as well as juvenile aphids and tsetse flies  are ovoviviparous  The eggs of ovoviviparous animals develop entirely inside the female  and then hatch immediately upon being laid  7  Some other species  such as those in the genus of cockroaches known as Diploptera  are viviparous  and thus gestate inside the mother and are born alive  11  129  131  134 135 Some insects  like parasitic wasps  show polyembryony  where a single fertilized egg divides into many and in some cases thousands of separate embryos  11  136 137 The different forms of the male  top  and female  bottom  tussock moth Orgyia recens is an example of sexual dimorphism in insects  Other developmental and reproductive variations include haplodiploidy  polymorphism  paedomorphosis or peramorphosis  sexual dimorphism  parthenogenesis and more rarely hermaphroditism  11  143 In haplodiploidy  which is a type of sex determination system  the offspring s sex is determined by the number of sets of chromosomes an individual receives  This system is typical in bees and wasps  26  Polymorphism is the where a species may have different morphs or forms  as in the oblong winged katydid  which has four different varieties  green  pink  and yellow or tan  Some insects may retain phenotypes that are normally only seen in juveniles  this is called paedomorphosis  In peramorphosis  an opposite sort of phenomenon  insects take on previously unseen traits after they have matured into adults  Many insects display sexual dimorphism  in which males and females have notably different appearances  such as the moth Orgyia recens as an exemplar of sexual dimorphism in insects  Some insects use parthenogenesis  a process in which the female can reproduce and give birth without having the eggs fertilized by a male  Many aphids undergo a form of parthenogenesis  called cyclical parthenogenesis  in which they alternate between one or many generations of asexual and sexual reproduction  27  28  In summer  aphids are generally female and parthenogenetic  in the autumn  males may be produced for sexual reproduction  Other insects produced by parthenogenesis are bees  wasps  and ants  in which they spawn males  However  overall  most individuals are female  which are produced by fertilization  The males are haploid and the females are diploid  7  More rarely  some insects display hermaphroditism  in which a given individual has both male and female reproductive organs  Insect life histories show adaptations to withstand cold and dry conditions  Some temperate region insects are capable of activity during winter  while some others migrate to a warmer climate or go into a state of torpor  29  Still other insects have evolved mechanisms of diapause that allow eggs or pupae to survive these conditions  30   edit  Metamorphosis Metamorphosis in insects is the biological process of development all insects must undergo  There are two forms of metamorphosis  incomplete metamorphosis and complete metamorphosis   edit  Incomplete metamorphosis Main article  Hemimetabolism Insects that show hemimetabolism  or incomplete metamorphosis  change gradually by undergoing a series of molts  An insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton  which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect s growth  The molting process begins as the insect s epidermis secretes a new epicuticle  After this new epicuticle is secreted  the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle  When this stage is complete  the insect makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air  which makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest  11  142 31  Other arthropods have a much different process and only molt  though must accommodate for the difference in exoskeleton structure and make up with other enzymes  Immature insects that go through incomplete metamorphosis are called nymphs or in the case of dragonflies and damselflies as naiads  Nymphs are similar in form to the adult except for the presence of wings  which are not developed until adulthood  With each molt  nymphs grow larger and become more similar in appearance to adult insects    The template below  Wide image  is being considered for merging  See templates for discussion to help reach a consensus    Like other insects that develop through incomplete metamorphosis  this Southern Hawker dragonfly molts its exoskeleton  shown above  several times during its pre adult life   edit  Complete metamorphosis Main article  Holometabolism Gulf Fritillary life cycle  an example of holometabolism  Holometabolism  or complete metamorphosis  is where the insect changes all in four stages  an egg or embryo  a larva  a pupa  and the adult or imago  In these species  egg hatches to produce a larva  which is generally worm like in form  This worm like form can be one of several varieties  eruciform  caterpillar like   scarabaeiform  grub like   campodeiform  elongated  flattened  and active   elateriform  wireworm like  or vermiform  maggot like   The larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa  a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon  There are three types of pupae  obtect  exarate or coarctate  Obtect pupae are compact  with the legs and other appendages enclosed  Exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended  Coarctate pupae develop inside the larval skin  11  151 Insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage  and emerge as adults  Butterflies are a well known example of an insects that undergo complete metamorphosis  although most insects use this life cycle  Some insects have evolved this system to hypermetamorphosis  Some of the oldest and most successful insect groups  such Endopterygota  use a system of complete metamorphosis  11  143 Strangely though  complete metamorphosis is unique to certain insect orders  like Diptera  Lepidoptera  and Hymenoptera  and no other arthropods undergo it  but incomplete metamorphosis   edit  Senses and communication Many insects possess very sensitive and or specialized organs of perception  Some insects such as bees can perceive ultraviolet wavelengths  or detect polarized light  while the antennae of male moths can detect the pheromones of female moths over distances of many kilometers  32  There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity  such that most insects with well developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae  and vice versa  There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound  while the patterns are not universal  insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it  Different insect species can have varying hearing  though most insects can hear only a narrow range of frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds they can produce  Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2 MHz   and some grasshoppers can hear up to 50 MHz  33  Certain predatory and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic sounds made by their prey or hosts  respectively  For instance  some nocturnal moths can perceive the ultrasonic emissions of bats  which helps them avoid predation  11  87 94 Insects that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions  and use them to home in on their hosts  Some insects display a rudimentary sense of numbers  34  such as the solitary wasps that prey upon a single species  The mother wasp lays her eggs in individual cells and provides each egg with a number of live caterpillars on which the young feed when hatched  Some species of wasp always provide five  others twelve  and others as high as twenty four caterpillars per cell  The number of caterpillars is different among species  but always the same for each sex of larva  The male solitary wasp in the genus Eumenes is smaller than the female  so the mother of one species supplies him with only five caterpillars  the larger female receives ten caterpillars in her cell   edit  Light production and vision Insects have compound eyes and two antennae  A few insects  such as members of the families Poduridae and Onychiuridae  Collembola   Mycetophilidae  Diptera   and the beetle families Lampyridae  Phengodidae  Elateridae and Staphylinidae are bioluminescent  The most familiar group are the fireflies  beetles of the family Lampyridae  Some species are able to control this light generation to produce flashes  The function varies with some species using them to attract mates  while others use them to lure prey  Cave dwelling larvae of Arachnocampa  Mycetophilidae  Fungus gnats  glow to lure small flying insects into sticky strands of silk  35  Some fireflies of the genus Photuris mimic the flashing of female Photinus species to attract males of that species  which are then captured and devoured  36  The colors of emitted light vary from dull blue  Orfelia fultoni  Mycetophilidae  to the familiar greens and the rare reds  Phrixothrix tiemanni  Phengodidae   37  Most insects  except some species of cave crickets  are able to perceive light and dark  Many species have acute vision capable of detecting minute movements  The eyes include simple eyes or ocelli as well as compound eyes of varying sizes  Many species are able to detect light in the infrared  ultraviolet and the visible light wavelengths  Color vision has been demonstrated in many species and phylogenetic analysis suggests that UV green blue trichromacy existed from at least the Devonian period between 416 and 359 million years ago  38   edit  Sound production and hearing Insects were the earliest organisms to produce and sense sounds  Insects make sounds mostly by mechanical action of appendages  In grasshoppers and crickets  this is achieved by stridulation  Cicadas make the loudest sounds among the insects by producing and amplifying sounds with special modifications to their body and musculature  The African cicada Brevisana brevis has been measured at 106 7 decibels at a distance of 50 cm  20 in   39  Some insects  such as the hawk moths and Hedylid butterflies  can hear ultrasound and take evasive action when they sense that they have been detected by bats  Some moths produce ultrasonic clicks that were once thought to have a role in jamming bat echolocation  The ultrasonic clicks were subsequently found to be produced mostly by unpalatable moths to warn bats  just as warning colorations are used against predators that hunt by sight  40  Some otherwise palatable moths have evolved to mimic these calls  41  Grasshopper stridulation Several unidentified grasshoppers stridulating Problems listening to this file  See media help  Very low sounds are also produced in various species of Coleoptera  Hymenoptera  Lepidoptera  Mantodea  and Neuroptera  These low sounds are simply the sounds made by the insect s movement  Through microscopic stridulatory structures located on the insect s muscles and joints  the normal sounds of the insect moving are amplified and can be used to warn or communicate with other insects  Most sound making insects also have tympanal organs that can perceive airborne sounds  Some species in Hemiptera  such as the corixids  water boatmen   are known to communicate via underwater sounds  42  Most insects are also able to sense vibrations transmitted through surfaces  For example  an insect is caught in a spider web and struggles to escape  The vibrations it produces are sensed by the spider  who is alerted to its presence  Through these vibrations  the spider can tell where on the web the insect is located  as well as how big it is  11  87 94 Communication using surface borne vibrational signals is more widespread among insects because of size constraints in producing air borne sounds  43  Insects cannot effectively produce low frequency sounds  and high frequency sounds tend to disperse more in a dense environment  such as foliage   so insects living in such environments communicate primarily using substrate borne vibrations  44  The mechanisms of production of vibrational signals are just as diverse as those for producing sound in insects  Some species use vibrations for communicating within members of the same species  such as to attract mates as in the songs of the shield bug Nezara viridula  45  Vibrations can also be used to communicate between entirely different species  lycaenid  gossamer winged butterfly  caterpillars which are myrmecophilous  living in a mutualistic association with ants  communicate with ants in this way  46  The Madagascar hissing cockroach has the ability to press air through its spiracles to make a hissing noise as a sign of aggression  47  the Death s head Hawkmoth makes a squeaking noise by forcing air out of their pharynx when agitated  which may also reduce aggressive worker honey bee behavior when the two are in close proximity  48   edit  Chemical communication In addition to the use of sound for communication  a wide range of insects have evolved chemical means for communication  These chemicals  termed semiochemicals  are often derived from plant metabolites include those meant to attract  repel and provide other kinds of information  Pheromones  a type of semiochemical  are used for attracting mates of the opposite sex  for aggregating conspecific individuals of both sexes  for deterring other individuals from approaching  to mark a trail  and to trigger aggression in nearby individuals  Allomonea benefit their producer by the effect they have upon the receiver  Kairomones benefit their receiver instead of their producer  Synomones benefit the producer and the receiver  While some chemicals are targeted at individuals of the same species  others are used for communication across species  The use of scents is especially well known to have developed in social insects  11  96 105  edit  Social behavior A cathedral mound created by termites  Isoptera   Social insects  such as termites  ants and many bees and wasps  are the most familiar species of eusocial animal  49  They live together in large well organized colonies that may be so tightly integrated and genetically similar that the colonies of some species are sometimes considered superorganisms  It is sometimes argued that the various species of honey bee are the only invertebrates  and indeed one of the few non human groups  to have evolved a system of abstract symbolic communication where a behavior is used to represent and convey specific information about something in the environment  In this communication system  called dance language  the angle at which a bee dances represents a direction relative to the sun  and the length of the dance represents the distance to be flown  11  309 311 Only insects which live in nests or colonies demonstrate any true capacity for fine scale spatial orientation or homing  This can allow an insect to return unerringly to a single hole a few millimeters in diameter among thousands of apparently identical holes clustered together  after a trip of up to several kilometers  distance  In a phenomenon known as philopatry  insects that hibernate have shown the ability to recall a specific location up to a year after last viewing the area of interest  50  A few insects seasonally migrate large distances between different geographic regions  e g   the overwintering areas of the Monarch butterfly   11  14  edit  Care of young Some bees  ants  termites and some wasps are eusocial  build nest  guard eggs and provide food for offsprings fulltime  see Eusociality   Most insects  however  lead short lives as adults  and rarely interact with one another except to mate or compete for mates  A small number exhibit some form of parental care  where they will at least guard their eggs  and sometimes continue guarding their offspring until adulthood  and possibly even feeding them  Another simple form of parental care is to construct a nest  a burrow or an actual construction  either of which may be simple or complex   store provisions in it  and lay an egg upon those provisions  The adult does not contact the growing offspring  but it nonetheless does provide food  This sort of care is typical for most species of bees and various types of wasps  51   edit  Locomotion  edit  Flight Main article  Wing  insect  Basic motion of the insect wing in insect with an indirect flight mechanism scheme of dorsoventral cut through a thorax segment witha wingsb jointsc dorsoventral musclesd longitudinal muscles  Insects are the only group of invertebrates to have developed flight  Note 1  The evolution of insect wings has been a subject of debate  Some entomologists suggest that the wings are from paranotal lobes  or extensions from the insect s exoskeleton called the nota  called the paranotal theory  Other theories are based on a pleural origin  These theories include suggestions that wings originated from modified gills  spiracular flaps or as from an appendage of the epicoxa  The epicoxal theory suggests the insect wings are modified epicoxal exites  a modified appendage at the base of the legs or coxa  53  In the Carboniferous age  some of the Meganeura dragonflies had as much as a 50 cm  20 in  wide wingspan  The appearance of gigantic insects has been found to be consistent with high atmospheric oxygen  The respiratory system of insects constrains their size  however the high oxygen in the atmosphere allowed larger sizes  54  The largest flying insects today are much smaller and include several moth species such as the Atlas moth and the White Witch  Thysania agrippina   Insect flight has been a topic of great interest in aerodynamics due partly to the inability of steady state theories to explain the lift generated by the tiny wings of insects  Unlike birds  many small insects are swept along by the prevailing winds 55  although many of the larger insects are known to make migrations  Aphids are known to be transported long distances by low level jet streams  56  As such  fine line patterns associated with converging winds within weather radar imagery  like the WSR 88D radar network  often represent large groups of insects  57   edit  Walking Many adult insects use six legs for walking and have adopted a tripedal gait  The tripedal gait allows for rapid walking while always having a stable stance and has been studied extensively in cockroaches  The legs are used in alternate triangles touching the ground  For the first step  the middle right leg and the front and rear left legs are in contact with the ground and move the insect forward  while the front and rear right leg and the middle left leg are lifted and moved forward to a new position  When they touch the ground to form a new stable triangle the other legs can be lifted and brought forward in turn and so on  58  The purest form of the tripedal gait is seen in insects moving at high speeds  However  this type of locomotion is not rigid and insects can adapt a variety of gaits  For example  when moving slowly  turning  or avoiding obstacles  four or more feet may be touching the ground  Insects can also adapt their gait to cope with the loss of one or more limbs  Cockroaches are among the fastest insect runners and  at full speed  adopt a bipedal run to reach a high velocity in proportion to their body size  As cockroaches move very quickly  they need to be video recorded at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait  More sedate locomotion is seen in the stick insects or walking sticks  Phasmatodea   A few insects have evolved to walk on the surface of the water  especially the bugs of the Gerridae family  commonly known as water striders  A few species of ocean skaters in the genus Halobates even live on the surface of open oceans  a habitat that has few insect species  59   edit  Use in robotics See also  Robot locomotion and Hexapod  robotics  Insect walking is of particular interest as an alternative form of locomotion in robots  The study of insects and bipeds has a significant impact on possible robotic methods of transport  This may allow new robots to be designed that can traverse terrain that robots with wheels may be unable to handle  58   edit  Swimming Main article  Aquatic insects The backswimmer Notonecta glauca underwater  showing its paddle like hindleg adaptation  A large number of insects live either parts or the whole of their lives underwater  In many of the more primitive orders of insect  the immature stages are spent in an aquatic environment  Some groups of insects  like certain water beetles  have aquatic adults as well  24  Many of these species have adaptations to help in under water locomotion  Water beetles and water bugs have legs adapted into paddle like structures  Dragonfly naiads use jet propulsion  forcibly expelling water out of their rectal chamber  60  Some species like the water striders are capable of walking on the surface of water  They can do this because their claws are not at the tips of the legs as in most insects  but recessed in a special groove further up the leg  this prevents the claws from piercing the water s surface film  24  Other insects such as the Rove beetle Stenus are known to emit pygidial gland secretions that reduce surface tension making it possible for them to move on the surface of water by Marangoni propulsion  also known by the German term Entspannungsschwimmen   61  62   edit  Phylogeny and systematics Evolution has produced astonishing variety in insects  Pictured are some of the possible shapes of antennae  Main article  Evolution of insects The evolutionary relationships of insects to other animal groups remain unclear  Although more traditionally grouped with millipedes and centipedes  evidence has emerged favoring closer evolutionary ties with crustaceans  In the Pancrustacea theory  insects  together with Remipedia and Malacostraca  make up a natural clade  63  Other terrestrial arthropods  such as centipedes  millipedes  scorpions and spiders  are sometimes confused with insects since their body plans can appear similar  sharing  as do all arthropods  a jointed exoskeleton  However  upon closer examination their features differ significantly  most noticeably they do not have the six legs characteristic of adult insects  64    Hexapoda  Insecta  Collembola  Diplura  Protura  Crustacea  crabs  shrimp  isopods  etc   Myriapoda Pauropoda Diplopoda  millipedes  Chilopoda  centipedes  Symphyla Chelicerata Arachnida  spiders  scorpions and allies  Eurypterida  sea scorpions  extinct  Xiphosura  horseshoe crabs  Pycnogonida  sea spiders  Trilobites  extinct  A phylogenetic tree of the arthropods and related groups 65  The higher level phylogeny of the arthropods continues to be a matter of debate and research  In 2008  researchers at Tufts University uncovered what they believe is the world s oldest known full body impression of a primitive flying insect  a 300 million year old specimen from the Carboniferous Period  66  The oldest definitive insect fossil is the Devonian Rhyniognatha hirsti  from the 396 million year old Rhynie chert  It may have superficially resembled a modern day silverfish insect  This species already possessed dicondylic mandibles  two articulations in the mandible   a feature associated with winged insects  suggesting that wings may already have evolved at this time  Thus  the first insects probably appeared earlier  in the Silurian period  1  67  There have been four super radiations of insects  beetles  evolved  300 million years ago   flies  evolved  250 million years ago   moths and wasps  evolved  150 million years ago   citation needed  These four groups account for the majority of described species  The flies and moths along with the fleas evolved from the Mecoptera  The origins of insect flight remain obscure  since the earliest winged insects currently known appear to have been capable fliers  Some extinct insects had an additional pair of winglets attaching to the first segment of the thorax  for a total of three pairs  As of 2009  there is no evidence that suggests that the insects were a particularly successful group of animals before they evolved to have wings  68  Late Carboniferous and Early Permian insect orders include both extant groups and a number of Paleozoic species  now extinct  During this era  some giant dragonfly like forms reached wingspans of 55 to 70 cm  22 to 28 in  making them far larger than any living insect  This gigantism may have been due to higher atmospheric oxygen levels that allowed increased respiratory efficiency relative to today  The lack of flying vertebrates could have been another factor  Most extinct orders of insects developed during the Permian period that began around 270 million years ago  Many of the early groups became extinct during the Permian Triassic extinction event  the largest mass extinction in the history of the Earth  around 252 million years ago  69  The remarkably successful Hymenopterans appeared as long as 146 million years ago in the Cretaceous period  but achieved their wide diversity more recently in the Cenozoic era  which began 66 million years ago  A number of highly successful insect groups evolved in conjunction with flowering plants  a powerful illustration of coevolution  70  Many modern insect genera developed during the Cenozoic  Insects from this period on are often found preserved in amber  often in perfect condition  The body plan  or morphology  of such specimens is thus easily compared with modern species  The study of fossilized insects is called paleoentomology   edit  Evolutionary relationships Insects are prey for a variety of organisms  including terrestrial vertebrates  The earliest vertebrates on land existed 400 million years ago and were large amphibious piscivores  through gradual evolutionary change  insectivory was the next diet type to evolve  71  Insects were among the earliest terrestrial herbivores and acted as major selection agents on plants  70  Plants evolved chemical defenses against this herbivory and the insects in turn evolved mechanisms to deal with plant toxins  Many insects make use of these toxins to protect themselves from their predators  Such insects often advertise their toxicity using warning colors  70  This successful evolutionary pattern has also been utilized by mimics  Over time  this has led to complex groups of coevolved species  Conversely  some interactions between plants and insects  like pollination  are beneficial to both organisms  Coevolution has led to the development of very specific mutualisms in such systems   edit  Taxonomy See also  Category Orders of insects and Category Insect families   Classification Insecta Monocondylia

Cladogram of living insect groups  72  with numbers of species in each group  5  Note that Apterygota  Palaeoptera and Exopterygota are possibly paraphyletic groups  Traditional morphology based or appearance based systematics has usually given Hexapoda the rank of superclass  11  180 and identified four groups within it  insects  Ectognatha   springtails  Collembola   Protura and Diplura  the latter three being grouped together as Entognatha on the basis of internalized mouth parts  Supraordinal relationships have undergone numerous changes with the advent of methods based on evolutionary history and genetic data  A recent theory is that Hexapoda is polyphyletic  where the last common ancestor was not a member of the group   with the entognath classes having separate evolutionary histories from Insecta  73  Many of the traditional appearance based taxa have been shown to be paraphyletic  so rather than using ranks like subclass  superorder and infraorder  it has proved better to use monophyletic groupings  in which the last common ancestor is a member of the group   The following represents the best supported monophyletic groupings for the Insecta  Insects can be divided into two groups historically treated as subclasses  wingless insects  known as Apterygota  and winged insects  known as Pterygota  The Apterygota consist of the primitively wingless order of the silverfish  Thysanura   Archaeognatha make up the Monocondylia based on the shape of their mandibles  while Thysanura and Pterygota are grouped together as Dicondylia  It is possible that the Thysanura themselves are not monophyletic  with the family Lepidotrichidae being a sister group to the Dicondylia  Pterygota and the remaining Thysanura   74  75  Paleoptera and Neoptera are the winged orders of insects differentiated by the presence of hardened body parts called sclerites  also  in Neoptera  muscles that allow their wings to fold flatly over the abdomen  Neoptera can further be divided into incomplete metamorphosis based  Polyneoptera and Paraneoptera  and complete metamorphosis based groups  It has proved difficult to clarify the relationships between the orders in Polyneoptera because of constant new findings calling for revision of the taxa  For example  Paraneoptera has turned out to be more closely related to Endopterygota than to the rest of the Exopterygota  The recent molecular finding that the traditional louse orders Mallophaga and Anoplura are derived from within Psocoptera has led to the new taxon Psocodea  76 Phasmatodea and Embiidina have been suggested to form Eukinolabia  77  Mantodea  Blattodea and Isoptera are thought to form a monophyletic group termed Dictyoptera  78  It is likely that Exopterygota is paraphyletic in regard to Endopterygota  Matters that have had a lot of controversy include Strepsiptera and Diptera grouped together as Halteria based on a reduction of one of the wing pairs   a position not well supported in the entomological community  79  The Neuropterida are often lumped or split on the whims of the taxonomist  Fleas are now thought to be closely related to boreid mecopterans  80  Many questions remain to be answered when it comes to basal relationships amongst endopterygote orders  particularly Hymenoptera  The study of the classification or taxonomy of any insect is called systematic entomology  If one works with a more specific order or even a family  the term may also be made specific to that order or family  for example systematic dipterology   edit  Ecology See also  Insect ecology Insect ecology is the scientific study of how insects  individually or as a community  interact with the surrounding environment or ecosystem  81  3 Insects play one of the most important roles in their ecosystems  which includes many roles  such as dung burial  pest control  pollination  and wildlife nutrition  An example is beetles  which are scavengers that feed on dead animals and fallen trees and thereby recycle biological materials into forms found useful by other organisms  82  These insects  and others  are responsible for much of the process by which topsoil is created  11  3  218 228  edit  Defense and predation See also  Defense in insects Perhaps one of the most well known examples of mimicry  the viceroy butterfly  top  appears very similar to the noxious tasting monarch butterfly  bottom   83  Insects are mostly soft bodied  fragile and almost defenseless compared to other  larger lifeforms  while the immature stages are small  move slowly or are immobile  hence all stages are exposed to predation and parasitism  So insects have a variety of strategies to avoid being attacked by predators or parasitoids  These include camouflage  mimicry  toxicity  and active defense  84  Camouflage is also important defense strategies  which involves the use of coloration or shape to blend into the surrounding environment  This sort of protective coloration is common and widespread among beetle families  especially those that feed on wood or vegetation  such as many of the leaf beetles  family Chrysomelidae  or weevils  In some of these species  sculpturing or various colored scales or hairs cause the beetle to resemble bird dung or other inedible objects  Many of those that live in sandy environments blend in with the coloration of the substrate  84  Most phasmids are known for effectively replicating the forms of sticks and leaves  and the bodies of some species  such as O  macklotti and Palophus centaurus  are covered in mossy or lichenous outgrowths that supplement their disguise  Some species have the ability to change color as their surroundings shift  B  scabrinota  T  californica   In a further behavioral adaptation to supplement crypsis  a number of species have been noted to perform a rocking motion where the body is swayed from side to side that is thought to reflect the movement of leaves or twigs swaying in the breeze  Another method by which stick insects avoid predation and resemble twigs is by feigning death  catalepsy   where the insect enters a motionless state that can be maintained for a long period  The nocturnal feeding habits of adults also aids Phasmatodea in remaining concealed from predators  85  Another defense that often uses color or shape to deceive potential enemies is mimicry  A number of longhorn beetles  family Cerambycidae  bear a striking resemblance to wasps  which helps them avoid predation even though the beetles are in fact harmless  84 Batesian and M llerian mimicry complexes are commonly found in Lepidoptera  Genetic polymorphism and natural selection give rise to otherwise edible species  the mimic  gaining a survival advantage by resembling inedible species  the model   Such a mimicry complex is referred to as Batesian and is most commonly known by the mimicry by the limenitidine Viceroy butterfly of the inedible danaine Monarch  Later research has discovered that the Viceroy is  in fact more toxic than the Monarch and this resemblance should be considered as a case of M llerian mimicry  86  In M llerian mimicry  inedible species  usually within a taxonomic order  find it advantageous to resemble each other so as to reduce the sampling rate by predators who need to learn about the insects  inedibility  Taxa from the toxic genus Heliconius form one of the most well known M llerian complexes  87  Chemical defense is another important defense found amongst species of Coleoptera  usually being advertised by bright colors  such as the Monarch butterfly  They obtain their toxicity by sequestering the chemicals from the plants they eat into their own tissues  Some Lepidoptera manufacture their own toxins  Predators that eat poisonous butterflies and moths may become sick and vomit violently  learning not to eat those types of species  this is actually the basis of M llerian mimicry  A predator who has previously eaten a poisonous lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future  thus saving many other species as well  88  Chemical defense is another important defense found amongst species of Coleoptera  with some species releasing chemicals in the form of a spray with surprising accuracy  such as ground beetles  Carabidae   may spray chemicals from their abdomen to repel predators  84   edit  Pollination  edit  Mutualism  edit  Parasitism  edit  Other biological interactions  edit  Relationship to humans  edit  As pests Aedes aegypti  a parasite  and vector of dengue fever and yellow fever  Many insects are considered pests by humans  Insects commonly regarded as pests include those that are parasitic  mosquitoes  lice  bed bugs   transmit diseases  mosquitoes  flies   damage structures  termites   or destroy agricultural goods  locusts  weevils   Many entomologists are involved in various forms of pest control  as in research for companies to produce insecticides  but increasingly relying on methods of biological pest control  or biocontrol  Biocontrol uses one organism to reduce the population density of another organism   the pest   and is considered a key element of integrated pest management  89  90  Despite the large amount of effort focused at controlling insects  human attempts to kill pests with insecticides can backfire  If used carelessly the poison can kill all kinds of organisms in the area  including insects  natural predators such as birds  mice  and other insectivores  The effects of DDT s use exemplifies how some insecticides can threaten wildlife beyond intended populations of pest insects  91  92   edit  As beneficial Because they help flowering plants to cross pollinate  some insects are critical to agriculture  This European honey bee is gathering nectar while pollen collects on its body  Although pest insects attract the most attention  many insects are beneficial to the environment and to humans  Some insects  like wasps  bees  butterflies  and ants  pollinate flowering plants  Pollination is a mutualistic relationship between plants and insects  As insects gather nectar from different plants of the same species  they also spread pollen from plants on which they have previously fed  This greatly increases plants  ability to cross pollinate  which maintains and possibly even improves their evolutionary fitness  This ultimately affects humans since ensuring healthy crops is critical to agriculture  A serious environmental problem is the decline of populations of pollinator insects  and a number of species of insects are now cultured primarily for pollination management in order to have sufficient pollinators in the field  orchard or greenhouse at bloom time  93  240 243 Insects also produce useful substances such as honey  wax  lacquer and silk  Honey bees have been cultured by humans for thousands of years for honey  although contracting for crop pollination is becoming more significant for beekeepers  The silkworm has greatly affected human history  as silk driven trade established relationships between China and the rest of the world  A robberfly with its prey  a hoverfly  Insectivorous relationships such as these help control insect populations  Insectivorous insects  or insects which feed on other insects  are beneficial to humans because they eat insects that could cause damage to agriculture and human structures  For example  aphids feed on crops and cause problems for farmers  but ladybugs feed on aphids  and can be used as a means to get significantly reduce pest aphid populations  While birds are perhaps more visible predators of insects  insects themselves account for the vast majority of insect consumption  Without predators to keep them in check  insects can undergo almost unstoppable population explosions  11  328 348 11  400 94  95  Insects are also used in medicine  for example fly larvae  maggots  were formerly used to treat wounds to prevent or stop gangrene  as they would only consume dead flesh  This treatment is finding modern usage in some hospitals  Recently insects have also gained attention as potential sources of drugs and other medicinal substances  96  Also adult insects  such as crickets  and insect larvae of various kinds are also commonly used as fishing bait  97   edit  In research The common fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster is one of the most widely used organisms in biological research  Insects play important roles in biological research  For example  because of its small size  short generation time and high fecundity  the common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a model organism for studies in the genetics of higher eukaryotes  D  melanogaster has been an essential part of studies into principles like genetic linkage  interactions between genes  chromosomal genetics  development  behavior  and evolution  Because genetic systems are well conserved among eukaryotes  understanding basic cellular processes like DNA replication or transcription in fruit flies can help to understand those processes in other eukaryotes  including humans  98  The genome of D  melanogaster was sequenced in 2000  reflecting the organism s important role in biological research  99   edit  As food Main article  Entomophagy In some parts of the world  insects are used for human food  while being a taboo in other places  In some cultures  insects  especially deep fried cicadas  are considered to be delicacies  while in other places they form part of the normal diet as they have a high protein content for their mass  In most first world countries  however  entomophagy  or the consumption of insects  is taboo  100  There are proponents of developing this use to provide a major source of protein in human nutrition  11  10 13 Since it is impossible to entirely eliminate pest insects from the human food chain  insects are present in many foods  especially grains  Food safety laws in many countries do not prohibit insect parts in food  but rather limit the quantity  According to cultural materialist anthropologist Marvin Harris  the eating of insects is taboo in cultures that have other protein sources such as fish or livestock   edit  In culture Scarab beetles held religious and cultural symbolism in Old Egypt  Greece and some shamanistic Old World cultures  The ancient Chinese regarded cicadas as symbols of rebirth or immortality  In Mesopotamian literature  the epic poem of Gilgamesh has allusions to Odonata which signify the impossibility of immortality  Amongst the Aborigines of Australia of the Arrernte language groups  honey ants and witchety grubs served as personal clan totems  In the case of the  San  bush men of the Kalahari  it is the praying mantis which holds much cultural significance including creation and zen like patience in waiting  11  9  edit  See also Book  Introduction to Insects Book  Insect Wikipedia books are collections of articles that can be downloaded or
