Claremont and artist John Bolton  In a 2008 interview  Stan Lee elaborated that he  did not think of Magneto as a bad guy  He just wanted to strike back at the people who were so bigoted and racist    he was trying to defend the mutants  and because society was not treating them fairly he was going to teach society a lesson  He was a danger of course    but I never thought of him as a villain   13  In the same interview  he also revealed that he originally planned for Magneto to be the brother of his archnemesis Professor X  13  Magneto s first original title was the four issue miniseries

mass grave  but Max survived  possibly due to the manifestation of his powers  Escaping from the mass grave  he was ultimately captured yet again 18  and sent to Auschwitz  where he eventually became a Sonderkommando  18  19  20  While at Auschwitz  Eisenhardt reunited with a Roma girl named Magda  with whom he had fallen in love when he was younger  and with whom he escaped the prison camp during the October 7th 1944 revolt  Following the war  he and Magda moved to the Ukrainian city of Vinnytsia  and Max adopted the name  Magnus   Magda and Magnus had a daughter named Anya  and lived

Lehnsherr the Sinte gypsy  for him  3   Erik  relocated to Israel  where he met and befriended Charles Xavier while working at a psychiatric hospital near Haifa  2  There  lengthy debates were held by the two regarding the consequences humanity faces with the rise of mutants  though neither revealed to the other that they both in fact possessed mutant powers  However  they were forced to reveal their inherent abilities to one another while facing Baron Strucker and HYDRA  Following the battle  Erik  now dressed as Magneto   realizing that his and Xavier s views were incompatible  left with a cache of hidden Nazi gold  which provided him with the finances to pursue his goals  Rise of Magneto Magneto and Xavier would eventually part ways because of the differences in their beliefs on how to help mutants  Art by Carlos Pacheco  Magneto s experiences surviving Nazi Germany  Auschwitz  and Vinnytsia would shape his outlook on the situation that mutants face in the Marvel Universe  Determined to keep such atrocities from ever being committed against mutantkind  he is willing to use deadly force to protect mutants  He would believe that mutants   Homo superior   will become the dominant life form on the planet and would set about either creating a homeland on Earth where mutants could live peacefully  or conquering and enslaving humanity in the name of mutantkind  Magneto s first villainous act was attacking a United States military base called Cape Citadel after bringing down missiles  He was defeated by Charles Xavier s mutant students  the X Men  in their first mission  21  He creates Asteroid M  an orbital base of operations in a hollowed out asteroid that he wanted to be a homeland for all mutantkind  He then gathered a group of angry and disillusioned mutants including his own  albeit at the time unbeknown to him  son and daughter Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch and formed the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants to further his goals  Magneto briefly conquers the fictional South American nation of San Marco in the hopes of establishing a mutant homeland there after stealing a military ship and getting Mastermind to cast an illusion of an army  but is once again foiled by the X Men  22  He tried to make the Toad infiltrate the X Men  but when that failed he captured the Angel and tried to force him to tell the secrets of the X Men  However the other X Men were able to rescue their member and destroy Asteroid M  volume  amp  issue needed  Constant defeat of him and the Brotherhood by the X Men led him to get captured by the Stranger  a powerful alien being  whom Magneto initially thought was another powerful mutant  The Stranger encased Magneto and Toad in a special cocoon and spirited him away to another planet  the Stranger s laboratory world  Back on Earth  Magneto s Brotherhood splintered  and Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch deserted him  23  Magneto escaped to Earth by repairing a spaceship on the Stranger s planet  but left the Toad behind  He captured nearly all the X Men and took over the Mansion  hoping to use the parents of Warren Worthington III to create a race of mutants  but was then recaptured by the Stranger after Xavier telepathically contacted the Stranger  24  Magneto remained on the Stranger s world for a time  but escaped again  made his way back to Earth  and reassembled the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants with the exception of the mutant Mastermind  25  He then captured the X Men  but with the help of the Avengers and a rebellious member of the Brotherhood  Toad  Magneto was defeated again  Magneto then created the Savage Land Mutates  With the Savage Land Mutates  he clashed with the X Men and Ka Zar  26  Along with Namor  Magneto later attacked New York City  27  He later fought the Inhumans Royal Family  28  and battled the Avengers once more  29  Magneto later reorganized the Brotherhood  and fought Professor X and the Defenders  Using ancient and advanced alien technology he found near the core of the earth  Magneto created an artificial humanoid he named  Alpha the Ultimate Mutant   Alpha rebelled against his creator and reduced Magneto to infancy  30  Magneto was then placed in the care of Xavier s former love interest  Professor Moira MacTaggert at Muir Island  At Muir Island  MacTaggert manipulated the infant Magneto s genetic code in an attempt to prevent him from becoming  evil  in adulthood  However  her genetic tampering lost its effect when Magneto reactivated his powers again  Magneto is eventually restored to adulthood  but to his physical prime rather than his older age  when he is found at Muir Island by the alien Shi ar agent Erik the Red  31  Magneto later gathered a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants  and with them battled Captain America  32  He then opposed Doctor Doom s conquest of Earth  33  Redemption Magneto goes on trial for his crimes in Uncanny X Men  200  Art by John Romita Jr  Magneto later discovered that former Brotherhood members the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver are actually his children  simultaneously learning about their recent marriages to the Vision and Crystal  He revealed to Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch that he is their father  34  He also discovered his granddaughter  Quicksilver s human child Luna Maximoff  34  Seeing Luna as a bond to the human race he has rejected  Magneto tried to reach out to his children  Angered by his rejection of them and their mother  they pushed him away and refused to forgive him  34  Magneto found himself allied with Professor Xavier and the X Men when a group of heroes and villains were abducted by the Beyonder  a nearly omnipotent alien being  This entity took them to a planet he created called the Battleworld to participate in a personal experiment of his to observe the concept of the battle between good and evil which would later be known as the Secret Wars  The characters were sorted according to their desires  Magneto was placed with the heroes as his desires were based on a wish to help mutants rather than the more selfish drives of the others  This surprised many of the other heroes  who still believed him to be a villain  although eventually they came to accept him as an ally  Captain America even spoke in his defense on some occasions  and the Wasp developed a certain affection for him  although it was tempered by her knowledge of his past  35  After the Secret Wars  Magneto was transported back to his base  Asteroid M  where the alien Warlock  traveling to Earth  collided into the asteroid  breaking it to pieces  Magneto was sent falling towards Earth and into the Atlantic Ocean  sustaining serious injuries  He was rescued by Lee Forrester  the captain of a fishing trawler  36  Lee helped him recuperate from his injuries  and the two shared a small romance  volume  amp  issue needed  After recuperating from his injuries  Magneto was asked to aid the X Men in battling the returned Beyonder  volume  amp  issue needed  Magneto stayed with the X Men even after the Beyonder was defeated  volume  amp  issue needed  His association with the team softened his views on humanity  and Magneto eventually surrendered himself to the law to stand trial for his crimes  A special tribunal was organized which chose to strike all charges against Magneto from prior to his  rebirth   deeming that this had constituted a figurative death of the old Magneto  However  the tribunal was interrupted by an attack from Fenris  the twin children of Baron Wolfgang von Strucker  Fenris was defeated  but Professor X was brought to near death due to the strain of the battle and previously sustained injuries  Xavier asked Magneto to take over his school and the X Men  and told him that doing so would make amends enough for his past crimes  Magneto agreed and chose not to return to the courtroom  Instead  he took over Xavier s school under the assumed identity of Michael Xavier  Charles Xavier s cousin  37  Seeing him try to reform  the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver began accepting him as their father  volume  amp  issue needed  Though Magneto made a substantial effort as the headmaster of the New Mutants and an ally to the X Men  his tenure was disastrous  The Beyonder plagued him yet again  slaying Xavier s current students  the New Mutants  38  and bringing them back to life soon after  39  This deeply traumatized the entire group  40  Magneto was then manipulated by Emma Frost  headmistress of her own school  the Massachusetts Academy  and White Queen of the Hellfire Club  into battling sanctioned heroes the Avengers and the Supreme Soviets  41  Magneto submitted to a trial once again  but used mind control circuitry he salvaged from the wreckage of Asteroid M to alter the opinions of the head justice in charge of the trial  As a result  Magneto was finally absolved of his past crimes but found that this had only fueled the hostility that normal humans have towards mutants  42  Feeling that desperate measures needed to be taken after the genocidal massacre in the Morlock tunnels  Magneto and Storm joined the Hellfire Club jointly as the White King  43  He was unable to prevent his students Roberto da Costa and the alien Technarch Warlock from running away from the school  44  or prevent the death of the young mutant student Douglas Ramsey after the students snuck away yet again to save a friend  45  and witnessed the apparent death of all of the senior X Men on national television  46  His relationship with the New Mutants deteriorated even further when they saw him and the Hellfire Club negotiating with the demons of the Inferno incident  47  Magneto later ousted longtime Hellfire Club co chair Sebastian Shaw in order to establish himself as the head of the Hellfire Club as the Grey King  During this confrontation he revealed his real purpose of raising an army for the coming war between humans and mutants  48  The New Mutants did not return to Magneto s tutelage  Seeing conditions for mutants grow progressively more perilous  Magneto began seeking allies to protect mutants from humanity  He participated in the Acts of Vengeance alongside such established villains as Doctor Doom  the Wizard  the Mandarin  and the Red Skull  volume  amp  issue needed  His temporary alliance with the Red Skull   an unrepentant Nazi war criminal   was a highly uneasy one  After confirming that the Skull was the original one who had worked with Hitler  Magneto took revenge upon him by entombing him alive  49  He also fought a cosmically powered Spider Man in order to examine his powers  50  He worked alongside Rogue  Ka Zar  and the American intelligence agent Nick Fury as well as a number of Russian operatives in order to reestablish peace in the Savage Land  51  This ultimately led to an altercation with Zaladane  who had appropriated the magnetic powers of Magneto s then unknown daughter  Polaris  The conflict ended with Magneto executing Zaladane himself  With her death  Magneto renounced his previous efforts to act as a mentor to the New Mutants and to follow Xavier s beliefs in peaceful co existence between mutants and normal humans  52  Avalon and Genosha Tired of the constant state of strife  Magneto set his sights significantly lower than world conquest  Instead  Magneto built a second orbital base called Avalon where he hoped to live a life of quiet seclusion  He was  by this point  a figurehead for the cause of mutantkind and was sought out by a group of new mutants calling themselves the Acolytes who pledged their service and allegiance to him  53  Under the influence of one of them  Fabian Cortez  he announced that the orbital base known as Asteroid M will be a new homeland for mutantkind  obtaining nuclear missiles from a sunken Soviet submarine he had previously destroyed and placed them around the Asteroid pointed towards Earth  volume  amp  issue needed  Magneto discovered how Moira MacTaggert had altered his genetic structure when he had been de aged  Enraged as he felt that his redemption had been a lie  he kidnapped Moira and subjected her to torture  Though it was later revealed that the genetic tampering had lost its effect when he had first used his powers after being re aged  and thus his actions had never been influenced by Moira s tampering  the damage was done  While the X Men attacked Avalon to rescue Moira and stop Magneto s plans  the Soviets launched a particle beam satellite which destroyed Asteroid M  Betrayed and abandoned at the last minute by Cortez  Magneto refused Xavier s pleas to escape with the X Men back to Earth and he and his followers seemingly perished in the subsequent explosion  54  It would later be revealed that Magneto survived the crash  as the Acolyte Chrome had encased him in a protective shell  However  Chrome and the other Acolytes died  volume  amp  issue needed  The United Nations Security Council  in response to a resurgent Magneto  voted to activate the  Magneto Protocols    a satellite network  in slightly lower orbit than Avalon  which skews the Earth s magnetic field enough to prevent Magneto from using his powers within  preventing him from returning to the planet s surface  In response  Magneto generated an electromagnetic pulse not only destroying the satellites  but deactivating every electric device on Earth within minutes  The X Men responded by hacking into Avalon s own computer systems to teleport a small team to the station with the aid of Colossus  who had joined Magneto as one of Magneto s Acolytes   Magneto  during the battle with the X Men  ripped the adamantium from Wolverine s bones  which enraged Xavier to the point that he wiped his former friend s mind  leaving him in a coma  This action later led to the creation of Onslaught an omnipotent being that was formed with the combination of both Xavier s and Magneto s powers  Magneto remained comatose on Avalon  worshiped by his Acolytes under the leadership of the ancient mutant Exodus  until Avalon itself was destroyed by the arrival of Holocaust from the Age of Apocalypse Earth  During the destruction  Colossus placed Magneto in an escape pod sending him back to Earth  This pod was intercepted by Astra  a former ally who now desires his death  volume  amp  issue needed  After cloning Magneto  Astra restored Magneto s memories and powers before attempting to kill him  Instead  Magneto  now fully revived  battled both Astra and his clone  After a pitched battle  Magneto triumphed over the clone sending him crashing into a South American barn  However  too weak to continue the battle  the real Magneto went into hiding while the now amnesiac clone became known as Joseph  christened as such by the nun who discovered him  and eventually joined the X Men  Since the world believed Joseph to be the real Magneto  Magneto took his time to plan  He engaged in a pair of brief diversions  first posing as  Erik the Red  and revealing Gambit s past crimes to the X Men  resulting in Gambit s expulsion from the group  Then he killed George Odekirk  the forger that created his  Erik Lehnsherr  alias to prevent his true identity from being discovered by Sabra and Gabrielle Haller  volume  amp  issue needed  Following this  Magneto constructed a machine to amplify his powers and blackmail the world into creating a mutant nation  The X Men and Joseph  who had fallen under Astra s control again  opposed him  Magneto s powers were severely depleted from over straining them in battling Joseph  who sacrificed his life to restore the Earth to normal  However  the United Nations  manipulated by its mutant affairs officer Alda Huxley  ceded to Magneto the island nation of Genosha  which had no recognized government  leaving Magneto unexpectedly triumphant  He then ruled Genosha for some time with the aid of many who had previously opposed him  including Quicksilver  Polaris  and the founder of the Acolytes  Fabian Cortez  and engaged in a brutal civil war with the island s former human rulers  volume  amp  issue needed  Despite the UN s hopes that Genosha s civil war between humans and mutants would destroy or at least occupy him  Magneto ultimately crushed all opposition to his rule and rebuilt the nation by forming an army of mutants dedicated to his cause  including mutants coming from all over the world seeking sanctuary  Eventually  Magneto was able to use the Genegineer s equipment to fully restore his power  Intending to declare war on humanity  he captured Professor X to use as a symbol with which to rally his troops  In the Eve of Destruction storyline  Jean Grey recruited a new group of X Men to help Cyclops and Wolverine rescue Xavier  they defeated Magneto when Xavier psychically cut off his access to his powers  Taking the opportunity for revenge  Wolverine attacked the depowered Magneto  crippling him with serious injuries  volume  amp  issue needed  The Destruction of Genosha While recovering from the stabbing he endured at the hands of Wolverine  Genosha was attacked by an army of Sentinels sent by Xavier s long lost twin sister Cassandra Nova Xavier  Over 16 million mutants and humans died in Genosha  with Magneto as one of the casualties  The attack came just after Polaris  one of the survivors  discovered the truth about her biological relationship as Magneto s daughter  volume  amp  issue needed  Magneto s last moments were spent revealing to Genosha Polaris s status as his daughter  Kuan Yin Xorn in the guise of Magneto also apparently converted a magnetic black box  designed to disable all forms of global electronic communication  into a recorder for a final message to the masses in which he tells his people that they will live on in the form of a radio message that records their last dying moments  55  Alliance with Charles Xavier on Genosha Magneto was presumed to be dead until a Chinese mutant named Xorn  who had been associated with the X Men as a teacher and follower of Charles Xavier  took on the guise of Magneto in the storyline  Planet X  in New X Men  150  and attacked the X Men mansion  then attacked New York City after kidnapping Charles Xavier  Xorn as Magneto was then beheaded by Wolverine in the same issue  When Charles Xavier was transporting the body of the supposed  Magneto  to Genosha for burial  a short time later  he was met on Genosha by the real Magneto  who had never left the island  in the first book of a revived Excalibur vol  3  Magneto explained that he did not

Shen Xorn  Shen Xorn claimed to be the twin brother of the original Xorn  now referred to as Kuan Yin Xorn  who  under the influence of the entity known as Sublime  had pretended to be Magneto  This claim was supported when Emma Frost conducted a thorough mind scan of Shen  The claim was confirmed by Kuan Yin Xorn himself as the leading intelligence of  The Collective   volume  amp  issue needed

Xavier met the real Magneto in Genosha  who apparently survived Cassandra Nova s attack and lived unnoticed within the ruins  Xavier brought with him the coffin supposedly containing the corpse of Xorn  but which is later shown to be filled with guns   and explains how the impostor had killed over 5 000 people including Jean Grey  Magneto is shocked and angry that people think he is capable of committing such an act  Xavier and Magneto put aside their differences to rebuild the island nation  rekindling their friendship in the process  56  Magneto s daughter Wanda suffered a mental breakdown over the loss of her children and started to warp reality in order to recreate them  inadvertently resulting in random attacks on the Avengers  until Doctor Strange put her into a coma to stop her  In Genosha  Magneto heard Wanda s psychic cry for help and created a wormhole  whisking her away before the Avengers were able to stop her  Back in Genosha  Magneto tended to Wanda  increasingly becoming more withdrawn and angry  He allowed only Xavier to visit  in the belief that Xavier could help Wanda  Xavier was angry to learn that Magneto had revealed to the world that he was alive by rescuing Wanda  but agreed to try and help  Months passed with no avail  and not even Doctor Strange s magic helped  The X Men and the Avengers meet to decide what should be done  and when some of the members suggest killing Wanda  Quicksilver informed Magneto of this development  before convincing Wanda to warp reality into the House of M  In the new reality  where the New Avengers  the X Men  and the members of Wanda s family all received their  heart s desires   Magneto was attacked by Sentinels over Manhattan in 1979  and revealed an alleged international anti mutant conspiracy involving Richard Nixon  This resulted in Magneto being granted sovereignty over Genosha as leader of the world s much larger and much faster growing mutant population  Magneto then turned Genosha into the most powerful  technologically advanced country on Earth  which he used as a base to dominate the world and place mutantkind above humanity  volume  amp  issue needed  A group of heroes were brought together by Wolverine   who alone remembers the way the world is supposed to be because his  heart s desire  was to regain all the memories stolen from him by the Weapon X Program   and have their own memories of the  real world  restored by Layla Miller  They banded together and attacked Magneto in Genosha  believing him to be the one responsible  During the battle Layla was able to restore Magneto s memories as well  and he confronted his son  enraged that Quicksilver had done all of this in his name  Quicksilver revealed that Magneto would have let Wanda die  but Magneto replied that Quicksilver was only using Wanda and himself  and he would never have allowed this to happen  Furious  Magneto kills Quicksilver  Sensing her brother s death  Wanda resurrected him and retaliated with the phrase  No more mutants   changing the world back to its original form and causing ninety eight percent of the mutant population to lose their powers including Magneto  Magneto was left a broken man  and Wolverine spared his life simply because Magneto wasn t directly responsible for this latest tragedy and because Wolverine felt that he  deserved every second of his

Magneto is attacked by Xorn  who has somehow evolved into a being of pure energy and merged with both an energy absorbing mutant named Michael Pointer and free floating mutant power energy that manifested itself after Scarlet Witch depowered the bulk of the mutant population  Xorn reveals that he  of his own free will  impersonated Magneto in order to rally mutantkind against humanity but

broken psyche of Professor Xavier  Together they managed to revive Xavier before being attacked by Frenzy  Magneto wounded Frenzy by firing a medical laser into one of her eyes  prompting Exodus to ask what punishment he would have instilled on a human who injured a mutant  as the Acolytes consider him a human  Exodus even claims that Magneto is dead and that Lehnsherr is just a shell that was left over   Magneto replied  Death  and Exodus proceeded to choke him with his telekinesis before Xavier challenged Exodus on the astral plane  After Xavier defeated Exodus  he left Magneto and Omega Sentinel to try and rebuild his lost memories  volume  amp  issue needed  Manifest Destiny Magneto appeared  seemingly repowered  reactivating Sentinels to attack the X Men just as they had recently relocated to San Francisco  The X Men defeated him in combat  but it was then revealed that his powers were artificially simulated by a suit designed by the High Evolutionary  and that his attack was merely a distraction so the High Evolutionary could gain an unknown object from the Dreaming Celestial in order to further a shared goal between Magneto and the High Evolutionary  60  After extensively examining the Dreaming Celestial  the High Evolutionary subjected Magneto to an extremely dangerous technological procedure in a successful attempt to restore his powers  61  Nation X Magneto appeared on Utopia  the new mutant homeland created by the X Men using the remnants of his old Asteroid M  Magneto stuns the X Men by offering to work with them impressed with their recent efforts in defending and helping mutantkind  62  Magneto feared the end of mutantkind until Cyclops informed him that Hope Summers  the Mutant Messiah is alive and well  He puts this offer in action as he assisted the X Men in defending Utopia Island from an attack of Predator X monsters  63  After helping the X Men defeat the Predators  Magneto  now considered a member of the X Men  assists them in stabilizing the asteroid from sinking into the Pacific  To that end  he worked with Namor and the Atlanteans by constructing a pillar supporting Utopia on the surface that would provide a home for the Atlanteans  which Magneto would later refer to as New Atlantis  However  Magneto s actions angered Cyclops who reprimanded Magneto for acting on his own authority  64  Despite Xavier being apologetic and appreciative for what he d done  Magneto left Utopia for nearby Mount Tamalpais in Marin County  65  In a final bid to gain their trust  Magneto entered into a deep meditative catatonic state to focus his powers at an interstellar distance  reverse the path of Breakworld s  Earth destroyer  Metal Bullet that Kitty Pryde was trapped in  and bring her home to Earth  Magneto had encountered the bullet earlier while working to regain his powers with the High Evolutionary  and had surmised that Kitty was inside  He had chosen to focus on ways to restore the powers of mutants  but he memorized the metals of the bullet allowing him to keep a trace on it  Using all of his powers  Magneto was able to bring the bullet back to Earth  drawing Kitty out of it and levitating her

that this Scarlet Witch is actually a Doombot in disguise  72  Magneto Goes Public With his reputation around the world as a well known mutant revolutionary terrorist  Magneto is talked into finding a solution to the problem by Cyclops before it goes public that he is established in Utopia  Kate Kildare  a  superhuman public relations specialist   advises him on a costume color scheme containing white  along with getting the public to  love and fear  him  both of which he refuses  With an earthquake inbound for San Francisco  Magneto uses his powers to stabilize the city s buildings  structures and metal vehicles  and to smooth the earth movements themselves  thus preventing any major damage and saving many lives  As a result  some of the city favors him  while others are reminded of how potentially dangerous he can be and has been  73  Powers and abilities Magneto is a mutant with the power to manipulate the Earth s electromagnetic fields to achieve a wide range of effects  The primary application of his power is control over magnetism and the manipulation of metal   ferrous and nonferrous  He can affect a very large quantity of metal at one time  For example  he has levitated objects as heavy as a 30 000 ton nuclear submarine and has used his power to move large asteroids several times  The maximum amount of mass that he can manipulate at one time is unknown  but his powers extend into the subatomic fields as evidenced during the Secret Wars  when he pulled ambient molecules of metal out of the surrounding atmosphere into a metal comb for Janet Van Dyne  and the dozens of times he has been shown to assembled his costume out of metallic molecules pulled from the surrounding air and environment  volume  amp  issue needed  He can manipulate a large number of individual metal objects simultaneously and has assembled complex machinery with his powers  He can also affect non metallic and non magnetic objects to a lesser extent and frequently levitates himself and others  Another way in which Magneto frequently uses his power is the projection of force fields which selectively block out matter and energy  These fields are strong enough to withstand the detonation of multiple thermonuclear weapons  hence Magneto is invulnerable to most harm when surrounded by his shield and can survive in deep space thanks to it  Magneto can also channel his powers through his own body to increase his strength and durability far beyond human limits and has a baseline reaction time 15 times shorter than that of regular humans  On occasion he has altered the behavior of gravitational fields around him  which has been suggested as evidence of the existence of a unified field which he can manipulate  He can also generate electromagnetic pulses of great strength and generate and manipulate electromagnetic energy down to photons  He can turn invisible by warping visible light around his body  74  Although Magneto has been shown capable of manipulating matter on a subatomic level  insofar as the electromagnetic force is responsible for chemical bonding   the use of his powers in this way seems to be difficult for him  and he has not been frequently depicted as doing so  He has demonstrated the capacity to produce a wormhole and to safely teleport himself and others via the wormhole  75  His powers have also demonstrated that he can condense planetary objects into subatomic size  volume  amp  issue needed  He is also regularly seen  flying   In Uncanny X Men  150  his costume is shown to be made of a metal mesh  allowing him to manipulate it into  flying   76  In the original Secret Wars series it has been explained as Magneto pushing the metallic minerals in the ground away from him  allowing him to fly  volume  amp  issue needed  Magneto has been consistently and frequently depicted as able to resist all but the strongest or most unexpected of telepathic attacks  A number of explanations have been proposed for his unusually strong resistance to telepathy  among them   a  technology wired into his helmet  the explanation given in the X Men film series and several comic plotlines    b  some physical aspect of his electromagnetic powers that can interfere with telepathy  he once used the Earth s magnetic field to dampen the powers of all telepaths within his reach    c  latent telepathic powers of his own or  d  sheer force of will  cf  X Men Vol  2  2   The theme of latent telepathic powers has been explored in a number of stories  among them the Secret Wars limited series  In some of his earliest appearances  Magneto was depicted as capable of engaging in astral projection  He has also  on rare occasions  been shown reading other s dreams  issuing telepathic commands  and probing the minds of others  77  He has demonstrated the ability to shield his mind  while in intense meditation  so completely that even Emma Frost was not able to read his thoughts  despite being directly in front of him and actively attempting to do so  65  In addition to his powers  Magneto has many other skills  He is a genius with competence in various fields of advanced science  especially in genetic manipulation  particle physics  engineering  and other fields of technology  He has engineered advanced weaponry  space stations  superpowered humanoid lifeforms  devices that generate volcanoes and earthquakes  devices that block telepathy  and devices that can nullify all mutant powers except for his own  He has reconstructed computerized devices from memory  He is fluent in many human languages and once single handedly deciphered the unknown language of a lost civilization  78  He possesses extraordinary skill in  reading  the microexpressions on others  faces and sensing what they are thinking and feeling  whether they are lying  fearful  etc  a skill which he refers to as  taking your enemy s measure   79  He also is a master strategist and tactician with extensive combat experience  and has often been successful in single handed combat against entire groups of superhuman adversaries  He also has some military training in hand to hand combat and has been shown to be effective with his fists  but he prefers to use his powers when in combat situations  Other versions Main article  Alternative versions of Magneto In other media Main article  Magneto in other media
