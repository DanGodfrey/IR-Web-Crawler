 commonly known as GM  formerly incorporated  until 2009  as General Motors Corporation  is an American multinational automotive corporation headquartered in Detroit  Michigan and the world s largest automaker  by vehicle unit sales  in 2011  3  GM employs 202 000 people 1  and does business in some 157 countries  General Motors produces cars and trucks in 31 countries  and sells and services these vehicles through the following divisions brands  Buick  Cadillac  Chevrolet  GMC  Opel  Vauxhall  and Holden  as well as two joint ventures in China  Shanghai GM and SAIC GM Wuling Automobile  GM s OnStar subsidiary provides vehicle safety  security and information services  The late 2000s financial crisis and late 2000s recession exacerbated GM s pre existing financial and corporate culture problems and pushed the corporation into a period of crisis  Two successive U S  presidential administrations wrestled with the question of what role the U S  government should or should not play in emergent intervention in the automotive industry  most especially at GM  In December 2008  U S  President George W  Bush agreed to a  13 4 billion bailout for General Motors  within months  an additional  39 billion was added by the Barack Obama administration  4  The financing came from the  700 billion fund known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program that was intended for financial institutions  5  Both presidents have stated that despite counterarguments presented to them in which the creative destruction of capitalism should be allowed to run its course  they chose intervention for GM in order to prevent collapse of the North American segment of the automotive industry and the economic sequelae that it was expected to have throughout the supply chain  such as huge job losses  credit market freezing  and loss of industrial base  GM emerged from a Chapter 11 reorganization in 2009  with an initial public offering that was one of the world s top 5 largest IPOs to date  GM has returned to profitability  even posting a record annual profit in 2011  although its economic impact and surroundings are different 6  from those in the era when GM was by many

leaner  greener GM  which will aim to break even with annual sales much lower than previously stated  28  President Obama declared that the restructuring  will mark the end of an old GM  and the beginning of a new GM  a new GM that can produce the high quality  safe  and fuel efficient cars of tomorrow  that can lead America towards an energy independent future  and that is once more a symbol

recently introduced and all new 2006 model vehicles produced and sold in North America  However  in 2009 the  New GM  reversed this  saying that emphasis on its four core divisions would downplay the GM logo  31   edit  Asia The company manufactures most of its China market vehicles locally through Shanghai GM  a joint venture with the Chinese company SAIC  which was created on March 25  1997  The Shanghai GM plant was officially opened on December 15  1998  when the first Chinese built Buick came off the assembly line  The SAIC GM Wuling Automobile joint venture is also successfully selling microvans under the Wuling marque  34 percent owned by GM   The Buick brand is especially strong in China  led by the Buick Excelle subcompact  The last emperor of China owned a Buick  32  The Cadillac brand was introduced in China in 2004  starting with exports to China  GM pushed the marketing of the Chevrolet brand in China in 2005 as well  transferring Buick Sail to that marque  GM also maintains a dealership presence in Japan  called GM Chevrolet Shop  previously known as GM Auto World Shop  Current GM Japan dealerships were either former Saturn dealerships or Isuzu dealership locations  GM products are also sold by the company Yanase  Ltd  In August 2009 the joint venture of FAW GM Light Duty Commercial Vehicle Co Ltd was formed that mainly produces Jiefang light duty trucks  33  General Motors vehicle sales in China rose 28 8 percent to a record 2 351 610 units in 2010  34  GM set up an auto research center as part of a USD250 million corporate campus in Shanghai to develop  gasoline hybrid cars  electric vehicles and alternative fuels  engines and new technologies   35  The company plans to double its sales from 2010 to about 5 million units in China by 2015  36  SAIC GM Wuling established the low cost Baojun brand to better compete with domestic rivals  Chery  Geely and BYD for first time buyers of cars priced around USD10 000  It is estimated that such market in China is about 5 million vehicles a year  larger than the auto market in France and Britain combined  However  some are worried that  local brands like Baojun could eventually become threats to their parent brands if they compete more against established models over time   Shanghai GM Wuling sold 1 23 million vehicles in 2010  mainly commercial vans and trucks  of which about 700 000 units were a van called Sunshine  37  In August 2011  GM announced plans to build a plant in Bekasi  West Java  Indonesia which would produce 40 000 passenger cars per year for the Southeast Asian market  It is the third plant in Southeast Asia  after the Rayong plant  Thailand and the Hanoi plant  Vietnam  38  In October 2011  President Obama  in a joint appearance at a GM plant in Michigan  said that the recently approved South Korea Free Trade Agreement would open up the South Korean auto market to American made cars  39   edit  Africa General Motors has a long history in Egypt which began in the 1920s with the assembling of cars and light pickup trucks for the local market  In the mid of the 1950s  GM withdrew from the Egyptian market  Some year later  the Ghabbour Brothers began to assemble Cadillac  Chevrolet and Buick models up to the 1990s  Since 1983 GM and Al Monsour Automotive Company has founded the General Motors Egypt which is currently the only manufacturer of traditional GM branded vehicles in Egypt  The Speranza Motors is a big company which started in the 1990s with the SKD assembling of Daewoo cars  Today the main products of Speranza are from the Chinese Chery concern  GM began operating in South Africa in 1913 through its wholly owned subsidiary  General Motors South Africa  Following the passage of the Comprehensive Anti Apartheid Act in 1986  GM was forced to divest from South Africa  and GMSA became the independent Delta Motor Corporation  GM purchased a 49  stake in Delta in 1997 following the end of apartheid  and acquired the remaining 51  in 2004  reverting the company to its original name  Another manufacturing base of the GM for the African markets is the Industries M caniques Maghr bines headquartered in Kairouan  Tunisia which assembles Isuzu and Mazda models for the Maghreb region  General Motors East Africa  GMEA  located in Nairobi  Kenya assembles a wide range of Isuzu trucks and buses including the popular Isuzu N Series versatile light commercial vehicle  TF Series pick ups and Isuzu bus chassis  Formed in 1975  GMEA s facility is the largest assembler of commercial vehicles in the region exporting to East and Central African countries including Uganda  Tanzania  Malawi  Rwanda and Burundi  In addition to assembly  GMEA also markets the Chevrolet products Spark and Optra  In the 1920s Miller Brothers Nigeria was founded as an importer of commercial vehicles of the Bedford brand into the country  In 1949  the company opened its own assembly plant and operated under the name Niger Nigeria Motors  In 1965 the plant and its distribution network was split into different companies and renamed as Federated Motors Industries  In 1991 the company was taken in by a joint venture

WTCC   24 Hours of Le Mans  NASCAR  SCCA  and many other world venues  Chevrolet Cruze in the WTCC Corvette Racing Team in the American Le Mans Series GM s engines were highy successful in the Indy Racing League  IRL  throughout the 1990s  winning many races in the small V 8 class  GM has also done much work in the development of electronics for GM auto racing  An unmodified Aurora V 8 in the Aerotech  captured 47 world records  including the record for speed endurance in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America  Recently  the Cadillac V Series has entered motorsports racing  GM has also used many cars in the American racing series NASCAR  Currently the Chevrolet Impala is the only entry in the series but in the past the Pontiac Grand Prix  Buick Regal  Oldsmobile Cutlass  Chevrolet Lumina  Chevrolet Malibu  and the Chevrolet Monte Carlo were also used  GM has won a total of 40 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series manufacturer s championships  including 34 with Chevrolet  the most of any make in NASCAR history  3 with Oldsmobile  2 with Buick  and 1 with Pontiac  GM leads all other automobile manufacturers in races won in NASCAR s premier series at 1 011  Chevrolet leads individual makes with 677 wins  In Australia  there is the V8 Supercar Championship which is battled out by the two main rivals of  GM  Holden and Ford  The current Holden Racing Team cars are based on the Holden Commodore and run a 5 0 litre V8 cylinder engine producing 635 bhp  474 kW   These cars have a top speed of 318 km h  198 mph  and run 0 100 km h in 3 8 seconds  The Holden Racing Team is Australia s most successful team in Australian Touring Car History  In 2006  amp  2007  the Drivers championship was won by the very closely linked HSV Dealer Team   edit  Research and development Research and development  R amp D  at General Motors began organically as the continuation of such R amp D as the various divisions  e g   Cadillac  Buick  Olds  Oakland  were already doing for themselves before the merger  Its character was entirely empirical  it was whatever key people in each company had been competent enough to organize and pursue  Charles F  Kettering s Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company  Delco   at Dayton  Ohio  was still an independent firm at this time  Its work was well known to GM central management through its relationship as a supplier and consultancy to Cadillac and Buick  In 1916  Durant organized the United Motors Corporation as an amalgamation of parts suppliers  supplying GM and other OEMs but independent of GM  40 Alfred P  Sloan  head of the newly acquired Hyatt Roller Bearing Corporation  became United Motors  CEO  United Motors acquired Delco  and Kettering began his association with Sloan  United Motors also acquired at this time the original Remy corporation 40   called the Remy Electric Company   a competitor of Delco  In 1918 General Motors bought United Motors  40  Various entities grew out of the original Delco and Remy  including the Dayton Metal Products Corporation  the General Motors Research Corporation  the Delco Division and Remy Electric Division of GM  Delco Remy  now Remy International  Inc    ACDelco  Delco Electronics  and others  Today s main successor corporation is Delphi Automotive  which nowadays is an independent parent corporation  The General Motors Research Corporation  at Dayton under Kettering  was the world s first true automotive research center  citation needed  During the next few decades it led the development of  many electrical appliance features for cars and trucks tetraethyllead and its widespread use as a gasoline additive  recognized today as a bad idea environmentally  but a technological wonder of its day  dichlorodifluoromethane refrigerant for HVAC and refrigeration applications  Freon  R 12  recognized today as a bad idea environmentally  being a chlorofluorocarbon  CFC    but a technological wonder of its day  commercially practical two stroke diesel engines better transmissions for track laying vehicles many other advancements Although GM R amp D  as it is known in colloquial shorthand  began as an organization largely built around one extraordinary man  Kettering   it eventually evolved into a more modern organization whose path is shaped by individuals but not dominated entirely by any of them  World War II was a turning point wherein military affairs  after mingling with the technologies of applied science for some 80 years  first started to become fundamentally reinvented by them  Civilian life  too  changed in this direction  By the 1950s  corporations such as GM and many others were facing a new era of R amp D  different from earlier ones  Less about genius inventors and individual inventions  and more about organizational progress and integrated systems  it raised new questions about where the capital for R amp D would come from in an era of limitless demand for R amp D  although not necessarily for production   Alfred Sloan  longtime CEO of GM  1920s to 1960s   discussed in his memoir  also considered a seminal management treatise  the relationships between government  academia  and private industry in the areas of basic science and applied science  in light of this new era  41  The views he laid out reflected  and influenced  wide consensus on these relationships that persists largely to today  Today  GM R amp D  headquartered in Warren  Michigan  is a network of six laboratories  six science offices  and collaborative relationships in over twelve countries including working relationships with universities  government groups  suppliers  and other partners from across the globe   edit  Small car sales Chevrolet Aveo Concept  later went into production as the Chevy Sonic From the 1920s onward  General Motors always maintained an internal dialog about what its economy car and small car policies should be  42  43  The economy and size considerations often naturally overlapped  although a strong distinction was always drawn in the 20th century between policies for the U S  market and policies for other markets  Economy  in some form  always had good demand anywhere  but its definition in the U S  was long considered different from that in other markets  In this view   economy  in the U S  did not mean  small  in the sense of what qualified as  small  outside the U S  The policy discussion often focused on topics like the higher demand for truly small cars in non U S  markets than in the U S   and whether it made more sense to import a car into a certain country or to build it domestically within that country  either as some variant of knockdown or with truly extensive domestic sourcing  42  GM s acquisitions of Vauxhall Motors Ltd  UK  1925  42  and Adam Opel AG  Germany  1929   42  rather than starting new domestic companies to compete against them  were based on analyses that convinced GM managers that acquiring an existing domestic manufacturer was a better business decision  42  Although GM since the 1920s has always offered economy models in the U S  market  relative to that market s definition in any given decade   and had done research and development in the 1940s and 1950s in preparation for any potential rise of strong demand for truly small cars in the U S  market  43  it has also been criticized over the decades for not doing enough to promote fuel efficiency in the U S  market in the 1970s through 1990s  GM s response has been that it has always responded to market demands  and that most Americans  despite anything they said to the contrary  did not actually demand  at purchasing decision time  small size or fuel efficiency in their vehicles to any great or lasting extent  Although U S  consumers flocked temporarily to the ideal of fuel economy whenever fuel supply crises arose  such as 1973 and 1979   they flocked equally enthusiastically to SUVs when cheap fuel of the 1980s and 1990s temporarily shielded them from any downside to these choices  Since the return of high fuel prices in the 2000s and 2010s  GM s interest in  truly  small car programs for the U S  market has been renewed  As part of General Motors Company development  it plans to revive one of its idled U S  factories for the production of a small car in Orion  Michigan  with the creation of 1 200 American jobs  This will be the first time ever that a large manufacturer produces a supermini vehicle in the United States  The new small car will add to a group of small and fuel efficient vehicles that the company is planning to roll out in the near future  This retooled plant will be capable of building 160 000 cars annually  including both small and compact vehicles  44   edit  Environmental initiatives The 2011 Chevrolet Volt  a breakthrough vehicle for GM  is a plug in electric vehicle  General Motors is one of the leading users in renewable energy  The company has published principles regarding the environment and maintains an extensive website to inform the public  In 2008  General Motors committed to engineering half of its manufacturing plants to be landfill free  In order to achieve its landfill free status  production waste is recycled or reused in the manufacturing process  The world s largest rooftop solar power installation was installed at General Motors Spanish Zaragoza Manufacturing Plant in fall 2008  The Zaragoza solar installation has about 2 000 000 square feet  190 000 m2  of roof at the plant and contains about 85 000 solar panels  The installation was created  owned and operated by Veolia Environment and Clairvoyant Energy  who lease the rooftop area from General Motors   45  46  47  In 2011  the company also invested  7 5 million in solar panel provider Sunlogics  which will install solar panels on GM facilities  48  The company has long worked on alternative technology vehicles  and has led the industry with ethanol burning flexible fuel vehicles that can run on either E85  ethanol  or gasoline  The company was the first to use turbochargers and was an early proponent of V6 engines in the 1960s  but quickly lost interest as the muscle car race took hold  They demonstrated 49 gas turbine vehicles powered by kerosene  an area of interest throughout the industry  but abandoned the alternative engine configuration in view of the 1973 oil crisis  In the 1970s and 1980s  GM pushed the benefits of diesel engines and cylinder deactivation technologies with disastrous results due to poor durability in the Oldsmobile diesels and drivability issues in the Cadillac V8 6 4 variable cylinder engines  In 1987  GM  in conjunction with AeroVironment  built the Sunraycer  which won the inaugural World Solar Challenge and was a showcase of advanced technology  Much of the technology from Sunraycer found its way into the Impact prototype electric vehicle  also built by Aerovironment  and was the predecessor to the General Motors EV1  GM supported a compromise version of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy  CAFE  standard increase from 27 mpg US  8 7 L 100 km  32 mpg imp  to 35 mpg US  6 7 L 100 km  42 mpg imp   the first such increase in over 20 years  50  GM announced they will introduce more Volt based plug in hybrids   edit  Hybrid electric vehicles Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid In May 2004  GM delivered the world s first full sized hybrid pickups  the 1 2 ton Silverado Sierra  These mild hybrids did not use electrical energy for propulsion  like GM s later designs  In 2005  the Opel Astra diesel Hybrid concept vehicle was introduced  The 2006 Saturn Vue Green Line was the first hybrid passenger vehicle from GM and is also a mild design  GM has hinted at new hybrid technologies to be employed that will be optimized for higher speeds in freeway driving  GM currently offers the 2 mode hybrid system used by the Chevrolet Tahoe GMC Yukon Cadillac Escalade  and GM 1 2 half ton pickups and will later be used on other vehicles  51  GM introduced the Chevrolet Volt in 2010  an electric vehicle with back up generators powered by gasoline  The production Chevrolet Volt was available in late 2010 as a 2011 model with limited availability  52  GM delivered the first Volt during December 2010  The GM Magic Bus is a hybrid powered bus  53   edit  All electric vehicles Further information  Who Killed the Electric Car  Batteries General Motors was the first company  in the modern era  to release an all electric automobile  In 1990  GM debuted the  Impact  concept car at the Los Angeles Auto Show  It was the first car with zero emissions marketed in the US in over three decades  The Impact was eventually produced as the EV1 for the 1996 model year  It was available through dealers located in only a few regions  e g   California  Arizona  Georgia   Vehicles were leased  rather than sold  to individuals  In 1999 GM decided to cease production of the vehicles  When the individual leases had expired  they declined to renew the leases or allow the lessors to purchase them  All of the EV1s were eventually returned to General Motors and  with the exception of a few which were donated to museums  all were destroyed  The documentary film Who Killed the Electric Car  covered the EV1 story  The EV1 s cancellation had disappointed supporters of electric vehicles  In 2010  GM debuted the Chevrolet Volt  an electric vehicle with back up generators powered by gasoline  General Motors has announced that it is building a prototype two seat electric vehicle with Segway  An early prototype of the Personal Urban Mobility and Accessibility vehicle dubbed Project P U M A    will be shown off in New York a day ahead of the press previews for the 2009 New York International Auto Show  54  dated info   edit  Battery packs for electric vehicles GM builds battery packs in southern Michigan  52  GM also established an automotive battery laboratory in Michigan  55  GM will be responsible for battery management systems and power electronics  thermal management  as well as the pack assembly  An existing GM facility at Brownstown Township was chosen to be upgraded as battery pack plant  52  LG Chem s U S  subsidiary  Compact Power of Troy  Michigan  has been building the prototype packs for the development vehicles and will continue to provide integration support and act as a liaison for the program   edit  Hydrogen initiative Sequel  a fuel cell powered vehicle from GM GM has prided its research and prototype development of hydrogen powered vehicles  52  to be produced in early 2010  using a support infrastructure still in a prototype state  The economic feasibility of the technically challenging hydrogen car  and the low cost production of hydrogen to fuel it  has also been discussed by other automobile manufacturers such as Ford and Chrysler  In June 2007  Larry Burns  vice president of research and development  said he s not yet willing to say exactly when hydrogen vehicles will be mass produced  but he said it should happen before 2020  the year many experts have predicted  He said  I sure would be disappointed if we weren t there  before 2020  56   edit  Flexible fuel vehicles GM produces several flexible fuel vehicles that can operate on E85 ethanol fuel or gasoline  or any blend of both  Since 2006 GM started featuring a bright yellow gas cap to remind drivers of the E85 capabilities  57  58  59  60  and also using badging with the text  Flexfuel E85 Ethanol  to clearly mark the car as an E85 FFV  61  62  GM is the leader in E85 flex fuel vehicles  with over 3 million FlexFuel vehicles on the road in the U S  As of 2009  GM offers 18 ethanol enabled FlexFuel cars and trucks in the US  and produces more than one million new FlexFuel vehicles  GM s goal is to have half of their annual vehicle production be E85 or biodiesel capable by 2012  63   edit  History Main article  History of General Motors The company was founded on September 16  1908  in Flint  Michigan  as a holding company for Buick  then controlled by William C  Durant  64  At the turn of the 20th century there were fewer than 8 000 automobiles in America and Durant had become a leading manufacturer of horse drawn vehicles in Flint  MI  before making his foray into the automotive industry  65  GM s co founder was Charles Stewart Mott  whose carriage company was merged into Buick prior to GM s creation  Over the years Mott became the largest single stockholder in GM and spent his life with his Mott Foundation which has benefited the city of Flint  his adopted home  It acquired Oldsmobile later that year  In 1909  Durant brought in Cadillac  Elmore  Oakland and several others  Also in 1909  GM acquired the Reliance Motor Truck Company of Owosso  Michigan  and the Rapid Motor Vehicle Company of Pontiac  Michigan  the predecessors of GMC Truck  Durant lost control of GM in 1910 to a bankers  trust  because of the large amount of debt taken on in its acquisitions coupled with a collapse in new vehicle sales  The longest lived continuous automobile nameplate still in production is the Chevrolet Suburban The next year  Durant started the Chevrolet Motor Car Company and through this he secretly purchased a controlling interest in GM  Durant took back control of the company after one of the most dramatic proxy wars in American business history  Durant then reorganized General Motors Company into General Motors Corporation in 1916  Shortly after  he again lost control  this time for good  after the new vehicle market collapsed  Alfred P  Sloan was picked to take charge of the corporation and led it to its post war global dominance  This unprecedented growth of GM would last into the early 1980s when it employed 349 000 workers and operated 150 assembly plants  GM led global sales for 77 consecutive years from 1931 through 2007  longer than any other automaker  In 2008  2009  and 2010  GM has ranked as the second

reorganization At the end of March 2009  U S  President Barack Obama declined to provide financial aid to General Motors  and requested that General Motors produce credible plans  saying that the company s proposals had avoided tough decisions  and that Chapter 11 bankruptcy appeared the most promising way to reduce its debts  by allowing the courts to compel bondholders and trade unions into settlements  Chapter 11 filing was necessitated largely by inability of former GM entity to support its pension liabilities and also to form commercial alliances with other automakers that could have aided cost reductions in existing business model  On June 8  2009  General Motors filed for reorganization under the provisions of Chapter 11  Title 11  United States Code  and as a direct result investments of all former common stockholders were lost completely   Reorganized GMGMQ Corporate statement of June 10  2009   GM management strongly believes that any recovery for the common stockholders in the chapter 11 bankruptcy process is highly unlikely  even under the most optimistic of scenarios  Stockholders of a company in chapter 11 generally receive value only if all claims of the secured and unsecured creditors are fully satisfied   Prior to chapter 11  the former GM stock hit a high of  93 63 on April 28  2000    On July 10  2009  with financing partially provided by the US Government  General Motors emerged from reorganization  GM was re listed on the NYSE on November 18  2010  setting the record for the largest IPO in US history with a value of  20 1 billion  67  Before the IPO  the U S  government owned a 27  stake in GM  and the Canadian government still owns a 12  stake in the company  The Ontario government has owned a 3 8  stake in the company since 2009  GM had filed for Chapter 11 reorganization on June 8  2009  Only the US Subsidiary was forced into bankruptcy  Shareholders were left without access to assets from GM owned assets in Asia or Europe  On July 10  2009  General Motors emerged from Chapter 11 reorganization  68  69  70  The Company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange again on November 18  2010 following a US 33 a share initial public offering of US 23 billion  including preferred shares  The shareholding in the Company by the U S  Treasury department is reduced from about 61  to about 33   including preferred shares and accounting for stock options given to former GM bondholders  71  72  Disposal of such shares gave the Treasury department about US 13 6 billion in proceeds  It was previously estimated that the Treasury would have to sell GM shares at an average of  43 67 a share to break even  SAIC Motor  partner of GM in China and India  acquired just less than 1 percent of the GM shares for about  500 million  73  74   edit  Brand reorganization As part of the company reorganization  the content and the structure of its brand portfolio  its brand architecture  was reorganized  75  Some nameplates like Pontiac  Oldsmobile  Saturn  Hummer  and service brands like Goodwrench were discontinued  Others  like SAAB  were sold  76  The practice of putting the  GM Mark

every brand to a multiple brand corporate invisible brand architecture structure  78  The company s familiar square blue  badge  has been removed from the Web site and advertising  in favor of a new
