History of Las Vegas The area was previously settled by Mormon farmers in 1854 and later became the site of a United States Army fort in 1864  beginning a long relationship between southern Nevada and the U S  military  Since the 1930s  Las Vegas has generally been identified as a gaming center as well as a resort destination  primarily targeting adults  Relatively inexpensive real estate prompted a residential population boom in the Las Vegas Valley in the 1990s and is still expanding in every direction  citation needed  Nellis Air Force Base is located in the northeast corner of the valley  The ranges that the Nellis pilots use and various other land areas used by various federal agencies  limit growth of the valley in terms of geographic area  Due to this reason  the valley has seen more mid  and high rise buildings erected  citation needed  Businessman Howard Hughes arrived in the late 1960s and purchased many casino hotels  as well as television and radio stations in the area  Legitimate corporations began to purchase casino hotels as well  and the mob was run out by the federal government over the next several years  The constant stream of tourist dollars from the hotels and casinos was augmented by a new source of federal money from the establishment of what is now Nellis Air Force Base  The influx of military personnel and casino job hunters helped start a land building boom which is now leveling off  Though Las Vegas s gambling revenues have been surpassed by Macau  the Las Vegas area remains one of the world s top entertainment destinations  5  6   edit  Boundaries Cities and communities of the Las Vegas valley The valley is contained in the Las Vegas Valley landform  This includes the cities of Las Vegas  North Las Vegas  Nevada and Henderson  and the unincorporated towns of Paradise  Spring Valley  Sunrise Manor  Enterprise  Winchester  and Whitney  The government of Clark County has an  Urban Planning Area  of Las Vegas  This definition is a roughly rectangular area  about 20 mi  32 km  from east to west and 30 miles  48 km  from north to south  Notable exclusions from the  Urban Planning Area  include Red Rock  Blue Diamond  and Mount Charleston  The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department is the largest police department in the valley and the state and exercises jurisdiction in the entire county  There are approximately 3 000 police officers that cover the city of Las Vegas  unincorporated areas  the town of Laughlin  about 90 mi  140 km  from Downtown Las Vegas  and desert and park areas within Clark County  The department does not exercise primary jurisdiction in areas with separate police forces such as North Las Vegas  Henderson  Boulder City  Nellis Air Force Base and the Paiute reservation   edit  Geography and environment Las Vegas Valley viewed in false color  from 438 mi  705 km  by TERRA satellite  Grass covered land  such as golf courses  appears in red  The picture bottom is just south of Sunset Road and the airport  the Spring Mountains on the west and Sunrise Mountain on the east  Las Vegas at night in 2010  The Las Vegas Valley lies in the Mojave Desert  The surrounding land is desert with mountains in the distance   edit  Climate The Las Vegas Valley lies in a relatively high altitude portion of the Mojave Desert  which tends to produce drastic changes of temperature between seasons  and also between day and night  The Valley generally averages less than 5 in  130 mm  of rain annually  7  Daily daytime summer temperatures in July and August are typically around 101  F  38  C  degrees  7  Very low humidity  however  tempers the effect of these temperatures  though dehydration  heat exhaustion  and sun stroke can occur after even a limited time outdoors in the summer  The interiors of automobiles often prove deadly to small children and pets during the summer and surfaces exposed to the sun can cause first  and second degree burns to unprotected skin  July and August can also be marked by  monsoon season   when moist winds from the Gulf of California soak much of the Southwestern United States  While not only raising humidity levels  these winds develop into dramatic desert thunderstorms that can sometimes cause flash flooding  Winter season temperatures in Las Vegas range from mild to chilly  with many days being quite sunny  Winter daytime highs are near 60  F  16  C  and winter nighttime lows are about 40  F  4  C   7  The mountains surrounding the valley are snow covered during the winter season  but snow accumulation in the area itself is uncommon  Every few years apart  however  Las Vegas does get a measurable snowfall   edit  Fault zones The valley has seven known earthquake fault zones  Frenchman Mountain Fault  Whitney Mesa Fault  Cashman Fault  Valley View Fault  Decatur Fault  Eglington Fault  West Charleston Fault  8   edit  Air quality Having part of the region located in a desert basin creates issues with air quality  From the dust the wind picks up  to the smog produced by vehicles  to the pollen in the air  the valley has several bad air days  Pollen can be a major issue several weeks a year with counts occasionally in the 70 000 plus range  Local governments are trying to control this by banning plants that produce the most pollen  The dust problems usually happen on very windy days  so they tend to be short and seasonal with full fledged dust storms occurring rarely  Smog on the other hand gets worst when there is no wind to move the air out of the valley  Also in winter it is possible to get an inversion in the valley air that actually traps any smog in the valley  Since manufacturing is not a dominant industry of Las Vegas  and with Clark County working to control air quality problems  some success has been shown over the years  The constant tightening of federal requirements for allowable particles in the air  however  make the task of meeting air quality standards difficult   edit  Water The native flora does little to help the soil retain water  During the intense rains of monsoon season or  relatively  wet months of January and February  a network of dry natural channels  called washes or arroyos  carved into the valley floor allows water to flow down from the mountains and converge in the Las Vegas Wash which runs through the Clark County Wetlands Park  The wash system used to form a large natural wetlands which then flowed into the Colorado River  until the construction of Hoover Dam on the Colorado River led to the creation of Lake Mead  Further development in the 1980s and 1990s made Lake Las Vegas  which required directing the Las Vegas Wash into tunnels which run under Lake Las Vegas and into Lake Mead  Nevada receives an allocation 300 000 acre feet  370 000 000 m3  of water 9  each year from Lake Mead  with credits for water it returns to the lake  The allocations were made with the Colorado River Compact when Nevada had a much smaller population and very little agriculture  The allocations were also made during a wet string of years  which overstated the available water in the entire watershed  As a result  precipitation that is below normal for a few years can have a major impact on the Colorado River Reservoirs  The Las Vegas area uses most of this allocation with Laughlin  Nevada using most of the remaining allocation  In June 2007  the price of a cubic meter was 57 cents in Las Vegas  10  Las Vegas gets around 90 percent of its water from Lake Mead  11  Early Vegas depended on the aquifer which fed the flowing springs supporting the meadows that gave the area its name  but the pumping of water from these caused a large drop in the water levels and ground subsidence over wide areas of the valley  Today  the aquifers are basically used to store water that is pumped from the lake during periods of low demand and pumped out during periods of high demand   edit  Urbanization The population doubling time in the greater metropolitan area was under ten years  since the early 1970s and the Las Vegas metropolitan area now has a population approaching two million people  This rapid population growth led to a significant urbanization of desert lands into industrial and commercial areas see suburbia    edit  Economy Exterior of the Palazzo hotel at night  A major part of the city economy is based on tourism including gambling and ultra luxury hotels Historical Visitors and Hotel Rooms Data through 2008  Room Projections Las Vegas Convention Authority The driving force in Las Vegas is the tourism industry and the area has about 150 000 hotel rooms  more than any city in the world  12  In the past  casinos and celebrity shows were the two major attractions for the area  Now shopping  conventions  fine dining  and outdoor beauty are also major forces in attracting tourist dollars  Las Vegas serves as world headquarters for the world s two largest Fortune 500 gaming companies  Harrah s Entertainment and MGM Resorts International  13  Several companies involved in the manufacture of electronic gaming machines  such as slot machines  are located in the Las Vegas area  In the first decade of the 21st century  shopping and dining have become attractions of their own  Tourism marketing and promotion are handled by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority  a county wide agency  Its annual Visitors Survey provides detailed information on visitor numbers  spending patterns  and resulting revenues  14  While Las Vegas has historically attracted high stake gamblers from around the world  it is now facing tougher competition from the UK  Hong Kong and Macau  China   Eastern Europe and developing areas in the Middle East  The financial and operating risks associated with pursuing the high roller market will persist  but some U S  casinos may opt out of chasing high end players altogether as the costs to attract these players increase significantly and the relative incentive declines  15  Las Vegas has recently enjoyed a boom in population and tourism  The urban area has grown outward so quickly that it borders Bureau of Land Management holdings along its edges  This has led to an increase in land values such that medium  and high density development is occurring closer to the core  The Chinatown of Las Vegas was constructed in the early 1990s on Spring Mountain Road  Chinatown initially consisted of only one large shopping center complex  but the area was expanded with shopping centers that contain various Asian businesses  Over the past few years  retirees have been moving to the metro area  driving businesses that support them from housing to health care  Las Vegas has been seeking to expand its manufacturing and research bases  There have been positive signs such as the World Market Center located in the city  and the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health  in addition to many smaller businesses  While the cost of housing spiked up over 40  in 2004  the lack of business and income taxes still makes Nevada an attractive place for many companies to relocate to or expand existing operations  Being a true twenty four hour city  call centers have always seemed to find Las Vegas a good place to hire workers who are accustomed to working at all hours  The construction industry usually accounts for a large share of the economy in Las Vegas  Hotel casinos planned for the Strip can take years to build and employ thousands of workers  The same could be said of the housing boom  With the introduction of Turnberry Towers  developers discovered that there was a large demand for high end condominiums  At the end of 2004  several major condominium towers were in various stages of development  however  by 2008  the construction industry was in a downturn due to the credit crunch  Constant population growth means that the housing construction industry is important  In 2000 more than 21 000 new homes and 26 000 resale homes were purchased  In early 2005 there were 20 residential development projects of more than 300 acres  120 ha  each underway  During the that same period  Las Vegas was regarded as the fastest growing community in the US  However  the financial crisis of 2007 2010 and the accompanying business downturn has sent business and growth tumbling  with Las Vegas recording one of the highest home foreclosure rates in the country  The disappearance of disposable consumer income and the backlash against corporate entertainment spending sent the hospitality industry into a tailspin from which it has yet to fully recover as of summer 2010  Other promising residential and office developments have begun construction around downtown Las Vegas  New condominium and high rise hotel projects have changed the Las Vegas skyline dramatically in recent years  Many large high rise projects are planned for downtown Las Vegas  as well as the Las Vegas Strip  In recent years rapid Manhattanization and Vancouverism has occurred in Las Vegas   edit  Construction See also  List of tallest buildings in Las Vegas Construction on The Strip Construction in Las Vegas is a major industry and quickly growing with the population  In March 2011  construction employed 40 700 people and is expected to grow with the recovering economy  16  Since the mega resorts that have defined Las Vegas today  began going up in the early 1970s  construction has played a vital role in both commercial and non commercial developments  Cranes are a constant part of the Las Vegas Skyline  At any given time there are 300 new homes being constructed in Las Vegas  Downtown and The strip always have at least one hospitality project under construction  In addition  in recent years Las Vegas has seen a spike in high rise housing units  Luxurious condos and penthouse suites are always being built  New suburban master planned communities are also becoming common in Las Vegas ever since The Howard Hughes Corporation began work on Summerlin  an upper class community on the west side of the valley  The massive project CityCenter broke ground on June 26  2006  Now completed at 3780 Las Vegas Boulevard South  it is the largest privately funded building complex in the world  At a cost of  9 2 billion  CityCenter was one of the largest projects in Vegas history  It put a massive strain on the construction ability and workforce of the area due to number of laborers and amount of materials required  Because of this  prices of almost any construction project in Las Vegas doubled  It is currently held by MGM Resorts International and has three hotels  two condo towers  and a hotel condo building along with a large shopping and entertainment center  Construction is expected to increase slowly in 2011 and 2012 however will pick up in 2013 with significant spending and millions of new jobs in the industry  17  In the near future  five years to a decade  it is estimated that Las Vegas will see an increase in commercial skyscraper developments in the Downtown area  A World Jewelry Center tower is planned for Downtown  It would stand as the tallest and only non hospitality or residential tower in Las Vegas  18  This will hopefully attract other developers and businesses in industries such as banking  finance  real estate  insurance  and media   edit  Housing Suburbs in the Valley are testament to the rapid urbanization in the region  Slab on grade foundations is the common base for residential buildings in the area  Traditionally  housing consisted primarily of single family detached homes  Apartment complexes generally were two story buildings  There have been exceptions  but they were few and far between  In the 1990s  Turnberry Associates constructed the first high rise condominium  Prior to this  there were only a handful of mid rise multi family buildings  By the mid 2000s  there was a major move into high rise condominiums towers  which had an impact on the region s skyline around the Strip   edit  U S  housing market collapse Las Vegas has been one of the top areas in the nation adversely affected by the recent subprime mortgage crisis and United States housing market correction  resulting in a free fall in home prices and mass foreclosures  As of January 2008  1 9  of homes in the Las Vegas area were in the foreclosure process  almost triple the rate of a year earlier  19  The problems  as it was mostly nationwide  was rampant speculation from house flippers  who sought quick profits and never intended to live in the homes they purchased  Also  resetting of many mortgage rates increased foreclosures  As of April 2008  51  of the more than 22 000 homes for sale in the area were vacant  according to Las Vegas real estate research firm SalesTraq  20  This downturn also negatively affected rental properties by placing downward pressure on rent prices  However  since the first quarter of 2010  the rental market has shown some signs of rebounding with average rent increasing 2  in the last six months  21  Changes in house prices for the area are publicly tracked on a regular basis using the Case Shiller index  the statistic is published by Standard  amp  Poor s and is also a component of S amp P s 10 city composite index of the value of the residential real estate market   edit  Technology companies Some technology companies have either relocated to Las Vegas or were created there  For various reasons  the Las Vegas has had a high concentration of technology companies in electronic gaming and telecommunications industries  Some current technology companies in southern Nevada include  Bigelow Aerospace  CommPartners  Datanamics  eVital Communications  Petroglyph  SkywireMedia  Switch Communications  WorldDoc and Zappos  Companies that originally were formed in the Las Vegas region  but have since sold or relocated include Westwood Studios  sold to Electronic Arts   Systems Research  amp  Development  Sold to IBM   Yellowpages com  Sold to Bellsouth and SBC   and MPower Communications   edit  Tourism The iconic Las Vegas Sign The major attractions in Las Vegas are the casinos and the hotels  The most famous hotel casinos are located on Las Vegas Boulevard on the segment known as the Las Vegas Strip  These larger casinos are located outside of the city  Many of these hotels are massive  providing thousands of rooms  and have large adjoining casino areas  There are many hotel casinos in the city s downtown area as well  which was the focal point of the city s gaming industry in its early days  Several large hotels and casinos are also located somewhat off the Strip  as well as in the county around the city  Nevada divides the area s casinos into several groups which cover the valley  these are the Boulder Strip  Downtown Las Vegas  LV Strip  North Las Vegas and the Balance of County which also includes areas that are outside of the valley   edit  Shopping Las Vegas has expanded its attractiveness to visitors by offering both affordable and high end merchandise in many shops and shopping malls  Many hotels on the Las Vegas Strip also have adjacent shopping malls  giving the Las Vegas area the highest concentration of shopping malls in any four mile stretch of road  In addition to the malls on the Strip  there are several outlying malls in the City of Las Vegas  Henderson  and the surrounding area  The monorail  lying somewhat east of the Strip  facilitates north south travel  including stations at several casinos and the Las Vegas Convention Center  Major malls include  The Crystals Bonanza Gift Shop The Boulevard Mall Galleria at Sunset Grand Canal Shoppes Fashion Outlets of Las Vegas Fashion Show Mall The Forum Shops at Caesars Las Vegas Premium Outlets Meadows
