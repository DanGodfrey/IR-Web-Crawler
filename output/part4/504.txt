April 12  1945   also known by his initials  FDR  was the 32nd President of the United States  1933 1945  and a central figure in world events during the mid 20th century  leading the United States during a time of worldwide economic crisis and world war  The only American president elected to more than two terms  he facilitated a durable coalition that realigned American politics for decades  With the bouncy popular song  Happy Days Are Here Again  as his campaign theme  FDR defeated incumbent Republican Herbert Hoover in November 1932  at the depth of the Great Depression  FDR s persistent optimism and activism contributed to a renewal of the national spirit  1  reflecting his victory over paralytic illness to become the longest serving president in U S  history  He worked closely with Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin in leading the Allies against Germany and Japan in World War II  but died just as victory was in sight  In his first hundred days in office  which began March 4  1933  Roosevelt spearheaded major legislation and issued a profusion of executive orders that instituted the New Deal a variety of programs designed to produce relief  government jobs for the unemployed   recovery  economic growth   and reform  through regulation of Wall Street  banks and transportation   The economy improved rapidly from 1933 to 1937  but then relapsed into a deep recession  The bipartisan Conservative Coalition that formed in 1937 prevented his packing the Supreme Court or passing any considerable legislation  it abolished many of the relief programs when unemployment diminished during World War II  Most of the regulations on business were ended about 1975 85  except for the regulation of Wall Street by the Securities and Exchange Commission  which still exists  Along with several smaller programs  major surviving programs include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  which was created in 1933  and Social Security  which Congress passed in 1935  As World War II loomed after 1938  with the Japanese invasion of China and the aggressions of Nazi Germany  FDR gave strong diplomatic and financial support to China and Britain  while remaining officially neutral  His goal was to make America the  Arsenal of Democracy  which would supply munitions to the Allies  In March 1941  Roosevelt  with Congressional approval  provided Lend Lease aid to the countries fighting against Nazi Germany with Britain  With very strong national support he made war on Japan and Germany after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7  1941  calling it a  date which will live in infamy   He supervised the mobilization of the U S  economy to support the Allied war effort  As an active military leader  Roosevelt implemented an overall war strategy on two fronts that ended in the defeat of the Axis Powers and the development of the world s first atom bomb  In 1942 Roosevelt ordered the Army to inter 100 000 Japanese American civilians in camps in the inland West  away from the Pacific coast  Unemployment dropped to 2   relief programs largely ended  and the industrial economy grew rapidly to new heights as millions of people moved to new jobs in war centers  and 16 million men and 300 000 women were drafted or volunteered for military service  Roosevelt dominated the American political scene  not only during the twelve years of his presidency  but for decades afterward  He orchestrated the realignment of voters that created the Fifth Party System  FDR s New Deal Coalition united labor unions  big city machines  white ethnics  African Americans and rural white Southerners  Roosevelt s diplomatic impact also resonated on the world stage long after his death  with the United Nations and Bretton Woods as examples of his administration s wide ranging impact  Roosevelt is consistently rated by scholars as one of the top three U S  Presidents  A liberal Democrat  Roosevelt defined his ideological position as  a little left of center  2  and also called his cabinet  slightly to the left of center   3  Contents 1 Personal life 1 1 Family name  early life and education 1 2 Marriage and family life 2 Early political

life Family name  early life and education See also  Roosevelt family and Delano family FDR at age 11 Roosevelt is an Anglicized form of the Dutch surname  Van Rosevelt  or  Van Rosenvelt   meaning  from field of roses   4  Although some use an Anglicized spelling pronunciation of   ru z v lt   that is  with the vowel of ruse  FDR himself used   ro z v lt   with the vowel of rose   The last syllable was pronounced by him with a schwa  or nondescript vowel  almost as vult   One of the oldest families in New York State  the Roosevelts distinguished themselves in areas other than politics  One ancestor  Isaac Roosevelt  had served with the New York militia during the American Revolution  5  Roosevelt attended events of the New York society Sons of the American Revolution  and joined the organization while he was president  While his paternal family had become prosperous early on in New York real estate and trade  much of his family s wealth had been built by FDR s maternal grandfather  Warren Delano  in the China trade  including opium and tea  6  His mother named him after her favorite uncle Franklin Delano  Roosevelt was born on January 30  1882  in the Hudson Valley town of Hyde Park  New York  His father  James Roosevelt  and his mother  Sara Ann Delano  were sixth cousins 5  and both were from wealthy old New York families  They were of mostly English descent  Roosevelt s great grandfather  James Roosevelt  was of Dutch ancestry  and his mother s maiden name  Delano  originated with a French Huguenot immigrant of the 17th century  7  8  Franklin was their only child  Roosevelt grew up in an atmosphere of privilege  Sara was a possessive mother  James  54 when Franklin was born  was considered by some as a remote father  though biographer Burns indicates James interacted with his son more than was typical at the time  9  Sara was the dominant influence in Franklin s early years  10  she once declared  My son Franklin is a Delano  not a Roosevelt at all   5  Frequent trips to Europe made Roosevelt conversant in German and French  He learned to ride  shoot  row  and play polo and lawn tennis  Roosevelt also took up golf in his teen years  becoming a skilled long hitter  He learned to sail  his father gave him a sailboat which he named  New Moon   Roosevelt attended Groton School  an Episcopal boarding school in Massachusetts  ninety percent of the students were from families on the social register  He was heavily influenced by its headmaster  Endicott Peabody  who preached the duty of Christians to help the less fortunate and urged his students to enter public service  Forty years later Roosevelt said of Peabody   It was a blessing in my life to have the privilege of  his  guiding hand   11  Roosevelt was a  B  student  Roosevelt in 1899 sailing with father James and half niece Helen Roosevelt went to Harvard College and lived in a suite which is now part of Adams House  in the  Gold Coast  area populated by wealthy students  Though he was a  C  student  he was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity  and also editor in chief of The Harvard Crimson daily newspaper  Roosevelt later declared   I took economics courses in college for four years  and everything I was taught was wrong   12  While he was at Harvard  his fifth cousin Theodore Roosevelt became President  and the president s vigorous leadership style and reforming zeal made him Franklin s role model and hero  13  In 1902  he met his future wife Eleanor Roosevelt  Theodore s niece  at a White House reception  they had previously met as children   Eleanor and Franklin were fifth cousins  once removed  14  At the time of their engagement Roosevelt was age twenty two and Eleanor nineteen  15  Roosevelt graduated from Harvard with an A B  in 1903  He later received an honorary LL D from Harvard in 1929  16  Roosevelt entered Columbia Law School in 1904  but dropped out in 1907 after he passed the New York State Bar exam  17  In 1908  he took a job with the prestigious Wall Street firm of Carter Ledyard  amp  Milburn  17  dealing mainly with corporate law  He was first initiated in the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and was initiated into Freemasonry on October 11  1911  at Holland Lodge No  8 in New York City  18  19  Marriage and family life See also  Roosevelt family On March 17  1905  Roosevelt married Eleanor despite the fierce resistance of his mother  15  Eleanor s uncle  Theodore Roosevelt  stood in at the wedding for Eleanor s deceased father Elliott   Eleanor had lost both parents by age ten  20   The young couple moved into Springwood  his family s estate  where FDR s mother became a frequent house guest  much to Eleanor s chagrin  The home was owned by Roosevelt s mother until her death in 1941 and was very much her home as well  As for their personal lives  Franklin was a charismatic  handsome and socially active man  21  In contrast  Eleanor was shy and disliked social life  and at first stayed at home to raise their children  Although Eleanor had an aversion to sexual intercourse  and considered it  an ordeal to be endured   22  they had six children  the first four in rapid succession  Anna Eleanor  1906 1975  age 69  James  1907 1991  age 83  Franklin Delano  Jr   March 18  1909   November 7  1909  Elliott  1910 1990  age 80  a second Franklin Delano  Jr   1914 1988  age 74  John Aspinwall  1916 1981  age 65   Roosevelt s dog  Fala  also became well known as Roosevelt s companion during his time in the White House  and was called the  most photographed dog in the world   23  Franklin and Eleanor at Campobello Island  Canada  in 1904 Roosevelt reportedly had affairs outside his marriage  including one with Eleanor s social secretary Lucy Mercer which began soon after she was hired in early 1914  In September 1918  Eleanor found letters revealing the affair in Roosevelt s luggage  when he returned from World War I  According to the Roosevelt family  Eleanor offered Franklin a divorce so that he could be with the woman he loved  but Lucy  being Catholic  could not bring herself to marry a divorced man with five children  According to FDR s biographer Jean Edward Smith it is generally accepted that Eleanor indeed offered  to give Franklin his freedom   24  However  they reconciled after a fashion with the informal mediation of Roosevelt s adviser Louis McHenry Howe  and FDR promised never to see Lucy again  His mother Sara also intervened  and told Franklin that if he divorced his wife  he would bring scandal upon the family  and she  would not give him another dollar   24  However  Franklin broke his promise  He and Lucy maintained a formal correspondence  and began seeing each other again in 1941 and perhaps earlier  25  26  Lucy was even given the code name  Mrs  Johnson  by the Secret Service  27  Indeed  Lucy was with FDR on the day he died  Despite this  FDR s affair was not widely known until the 1960s  28  Roosevelt s son Elliott stated that Franklin also had a 20 year affair with his private secretary Marguerite  Missy  LeHand  29  The effect of these affairs upon Eleanor Roosevelt is difficult to estimate   I have the memory of an elephant  I can forgive  but I cannot forget   she wrote to a close friend  30  After the affair any remaining intimacy left their relationship  Eleanor soon thereafter established a separate house in Hyde Park at Valkill  and increasingly devoted herself to various social and political causes  For the rest of their lives  the Roosevelts  marriage was more of a political partnership than an intimate relationship  31  The emotional break in their marriage was so severe that when FDR asked Eleanor in 1942 in light of his failing health to come back home and live with him again  she refused  28  Early political career State Senator  amp  Tammany antagonist In the State election of 1910  Roosevelt ran for the New York State Senate from the district around Hyde Park in Dutchess County  which had not elected a Democrat since 1884  The Roosevelt name  with its associated wealth  prestige  and influence in the Hudson Valley  and the Democratic landslide that year  carried him to the state capital in Albany  32  Taking his seat on January 1  1911  he became the leader of a group of  Insurgents  who opposed the bossism of the Tammany machine dominating the state Democratic Party  The U S  Senate election which began with the Democratic caucus on January 16  1911  was deadlocked by the struggle of the two factions for 74 days  On March 31  James A  O Gorman was elected  and Roosevelt had achieved his goal  to upset the Tammany machine by blocking their choice  William F  Sheehan  This brought Roosevelt national exposure and some experience in political tactics and intrigue  33  Roosevelt soon became a popular figure among New York Democrats  though he had not as yet become an eloquent speaker  32  Despite a bout of typhoid  and thanks to the help of Louis McHenry Howe who ran his campaign  he was re elected for a second term in the State election of 1912  and served as chairman of the Agriculture Committee  His success with farm and labor bills was a bit of a precursor to his New Deal policies twenty years later  34  By this time he had become more consistently progressive  in support of labor and social welfare programs for women and children  cousin Teddy was of some influence on these issues  35  Roosevelt  again in opposition to Tammany Hall  supported Woodrow Wilson s successful bid in the 1912 presidential election  and thereby earned an informal designation as an original Wilson man  36  This opened the door for opportunities in the Wilson administration  Roosevelt resigned from the New York State Senate on March 17  1913  to accept his appointment as Assistant U S  Secretary of the Navy  37  Assistant Secretary of the Navy Roosevelt as Assistant Secretary of the Navy  Franklin D  Roosevelt was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy by Woodrow Wilson in 1913 and served under Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels  Roosevelt developed a life long affection for the Navy  and was more ardent than his boss Daniels in supporting a large and efficient naval force  38  As assistant secretary  Roosevelt worked to expand the Navy and founded the United States Navy Reserve  Roosevelt negotiated with Congressional leaders and other government departments to get budgets approved  He opposed the Taylor  stop watch  system which was hailed by shipbuilding managers but opposed by the unions  Not a single union strike occurred during his seven plus years in the Navy department  39  In 1914  Roosevelt made an ill conceived decision to run for the U S  Senate seat for New York  The decision was doomed for lack of Wilson administration backing  He was determined to take on Tammany again at a time when Wilson needed them to help marshal his legislation and secure his future re election  40  He was soundly defeated in the Democratic primary election for the United States Senate by Tammany Hall backed James W  Gerard by a margin of 3 to 1  41  Roosevelt learned a valuable lesson   that federal patronage alone  without White House support  could not defeat a strong local organization  42  In March 1917  after Germany initiated its submarine warfare campaign  Roosevelt asked Wilson for permission  which was denied  to fit the naval fleet out for war  43  He became an enthusiastic advocate of the submarine and of means to combat the German submarine menace to Allied shipping  he proposed building a mine barrier across the North Sea from Norway to Scotland  In 1918  he visited Britain and France to inspect American naval facilities  during this visit he met Winston Churchill for the first time  Roosevelt wanted to provide arms to the merchant marine  knowing that a sale of arms was prohibited  he asked Wilson for approval to lease the arms to the mariners  Wilson ultimately approved this by executive order  and a precedent was set for this action in 1940  During these war years  Roosevelt acted to make peace with the Tammany Hall forces  and in 1918 the group actually supported others in an unsuccessful attempt to convince him to run for governor of New York  He very much wished to get into a military uniform  but the armistice took shape before this could materialize  44  With the end of World War I in November 1918  Roosevelt was in charge of demobilization  although he opposed plans to completely dismantle the Navy  In 1919  Roosevelt came under fire from newspapers in Newport  Rhode Island  over his handling of what came to be known as the Newport sex scandal  Campaign for Vice President In July 1920  overshadowed by the Newport sex scandal and its coverage in the Providence Journal and New York Times  Roosevelt resigned as Assistant Secretary of the Navy to run for Vice President  In a series of speeches in his campaign for Vice President  Roosevelt claimed  tongue in cheek  that as Assistant Secretary of the Navy he wrote the constitution which the U S  imposed on Haiti in 1915  45  The 1920 Democratic National Convention chose Roosevelt by acclamation as the candidate for Vice President of the United States  46  The ticket was headed by Governor James M  Cox of Ohio  and Roosevelt was considered as bringing balance to the ticket as a moderate  a Wilsonian and a prohibitionist  47  The Cox Roosevelt ticket was defeated by Republican Warren G  Harding in the presidential election by a wide margin  This nomination as Vice President was somewhat meteoric in nature  as Roosevelt had just turned thirty eight  four years younger than his cousin Teddy had been when he first got the same nomination from his party  48  Roosevelt then returned to New York law practice and joined the newly organized New York Civitan Club  49  but few doubted that he would soon run for public office again  Paralytic illness Main article  Franklin D  Roosevelt s paralytic illness Wheelchair photo of FDR In August 1921  while the Roosevelts were vacationing at Campobello Island  New Brunswick  Canada  Roosevelt contracted an illness diagnosed then as polio which resulted in permanent paralysis from the waist down  this diagnosis has since been questioned  50  For the rest of his life  Roosevelt refused to accept that he was permanently paralyzed  51  He tried a wide range of therapies  including hydrotherapy  and  in 1926  he purchased a resort at Warm Springs  Georgia  where he founded a hydrotherapy center for the treatment of polio patients which still operates as the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation  52  After he became President  he helped to found the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis  now known as the March of Dimes   At the time  Roosevelt was able to convince many people that he was getting better  which he believed was essential if he was to run for public office again  Fitting his hips and legs with iron braces  he laboriously taught himself to walk a short distance by swiveling his torso while supporting himself with a cane  In private  he used a wheelchair  but he was careful never to be seen in it in public  Great care was also taken to prevent his being portrayed by the press in a way which would highlight his disability  Only two photographs are known to exist of FDR which were taken while he was in his wheelchair  only four seconds of film exist of the  walk  he achieved after his illness  53  He usually appeared in public standing upright  supported on one side by an aide or one of his sons  FDR used a car with specially designed hand controls  which provided him further mobility  54  In the public mind  Roosevelt has been by far the most famous polio survivor  However  his age at onset  39 years  and the majority of symptoms of his illness are more consistent with a diagnosis of Guillain Barr  syndrome  55  Since Roosevelt s cerebrospinal fluid was not examined  the cause may never be known for certain  Governor of New York  1929 1932 Main article  Franklin D  Roosevelt s terms as Governor of New York FDR with Al Smith in 1930 Roosevelt maintained contacts and mended fences with the Democratic Party during the 1920s  especially in New York  Although he initially had made his name as an opponent of New York City s Tammany Hall machine  Roosevelt moderated his stance against that group as well  56  He helped Alfred E  Smith win the election for governor of New York in 1922  and was even a strong supporter of Smith against his cousin  Republican Theodore Roosevelt  Jr  in 1924  57  Roosevelt gave nominating speeches for Smith at the 1924 and 1928 Democratic conventions  58  As the Democratic Party presidential nominee in the 1928 election  Smith in turn asked Roosevelt to run for governor in the state election  Roosevelt was nominated by the Democrats by acclamation  59  While Smith lost the Presidency in a landslide  and was even defeated in his home state  Roosevelt was narrowly elected governor  by a one percent margin  60  As a reform governor  he established a number of new social programs  and he was advised by Frances Perkins and Harry Hopkins  In May 1930  as he began his run for a second term  Roosevelt reiterated his doctrine from the campaign two years before   that progressive government by its very terms  must be a living and growing thing  that the battle for it is never ending and that if we let up for one single moment or one single year  not merely do we stand still but we fall back in the march of civilization   61  In this campaign for re election  Roosevelt needed the good will of the Tammany Hall machine in New York City to succeed  however  his Republican opponent  Charles H  Tuttle  used Roosevelt s connection with Tammany Hall s corruption as an election issue  As the election approached  Roosevelt began preemptive efforts by initiating investigations of the sale of judicial offices  He was directly involved  as he had made a routine short term court appointment of a Tammany Hall man  who was alleged to have paid Tammany  30 000 for the position  61  His Republican opponent  however  could not overcome the public s criticism of his party for current economic distress  and Roosevelt was elected to a second term by a margin of fourteen percent  62  1932 presidential election Main article  United States presidential election  1932 Roosevelt s strong base in the most populous state made him an obvious candidate for the Democratic nomination  which was hotly contested in light of incumbent Herbert Hoover s vulnerability  Al Smith was supported by some city bosses  but had lost control of the New York Democratic party to Roosevelt  Roosevelt built his own national coalition with personal allies such as newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst  Irish leader Joseph P  Kennedy  Sr   and California leader William Gibbs McAdoo  When Texas leader John Nance Garner switched to FDR  he was given the vice presidential nomination  In his acceptance speech  Roosevelt declared I pledge you  I pledge myself to a new deal for the American people    This is more than a political campaign  It is a call to arms  63  The election campaign was conducted under the shadow of the Great Depression in the United States  and the new alliances which it created  Roosevelt and the Democratic Party mobilized the expanded ranks of the poor as well as organized labor  ethnic minorities  urbanites  and Southern whites  crafting the New Deal coalition  Color photo of Roosevelt as the Man of the Year of TIME Magazine  January 1933 Economist Marriner Eccles observed that  given later developments  the campaign speeches often read like a giant misprint  in which Roosevelt and Hoover speak each other s lines   64  Roosevelt denounced Hoover s failures to restore prosperity or even halt the downward slide  and he ridiculed Hoover s huge deficits  Roosevelt campaigned on the Democratic platform advocating  immediate and drastic reductions of all public expenditures    abolishing useless commissions and offices  consolidating departments and bureaus  and eliminating extravagances  and for a  sound currency to be maintained at all hazards   On September 23  Roosevelt made the gloomy evaluation that   Our industrial plant is built  the problem just now is whether under existing conditions it is not overbuilt  Our last frontier has long since been reached   65  Hoover damned that pessimism as a denial of  the promise of American life     the counsel of despair   66  The prohibition issue solidified the wet vote for Roosevelt  who noted that repeal would bring in new tax revenues  Roosevelt won 57  of the vote and carried all but six states  Historians and political scientists consider the 1932 36 elections a realigning election that created a new majority coalition for the Democrats  one made up of organized labor  blacks  and ethnic Americans such as Italian Americans  Polish Americans and Jews  Thus  this transformed American politics and starting what is called the  New Deal Party System  or  by political scientists  the Fifth Party System  67  After the election  Roosevelt refused Hoover s requests for a meeting to develop a joint program to stop the downward spiral and calm investors  claiming publicly it would tie his hands  and that Hoover had all the power to act if necessary  Unofficially  he told reporters that  it is not my baby   68  The economy spiraled downward until the banking system began a complete nationwide shutdown as Hoover s term ended  69  In February 1933  Roosevelt escaped an assassination attempt by Giuseppe Zangara  whose shots killed Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak sitting alongside   70  Roosevelt leaned heavily on his  Brain Trust  of academic advisors  especially Raymond Moley when designing his policies  he offered cabinet positions to numerous candidates  but some declined  The cabinet member with the strongest independent base was Cordell Hull at State  William Hartman Woodin   at Treasury   was soon replaced by the much more powerful Henry Morgenthau  Jr  71  Presidency  1933 1945 First term  1933 1937 See also  New Deal Roosevelt and Hoover on Inauguration Day  1933  Presidential Portrait of Franklin D  Roosevelt  When Roosevelt was inaugurated March 4  1933  32 days after Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany   the U S  was at the nadir of the worst depression in its history  A quarter of the workforce was unemployed  Farmers were in deep trouble as prices fell by 60   Industrial production had fallen by more than half since 1929  Two million were homeless  By the evening of March 4  32 of the 48 states  as well as the District of Columbia had closed their banks  72  The New York Federal Reserve Bank was unable to open on the 5th  as huge sums had been withdrawn by panicky customers in previous days  73  Beginning with his inauguration address  Roosevelt began blaming the economic crisis on bankers and financiers  the quest for profit  and the self interest basis of capitalism  Primarily this is because rulers of the exchange of mankind s goods have failed through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence  have admitted their failure  and have abdicated  Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion  rejected by the hearts and minds of men  True they have tried  but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition  Faced by failure of credit they have proposed only the lending of more money  Stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership  they have resorted to exhortations  pleading tearfully for restored confidence    The money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization  We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths  The measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit  74  Historians categorized Roosevelt s program as  relief  recovery and reform   Relief was urgently needed by tens of millions of unemployed  Recovery meant boosting the economy back to normal  Reform meant long term fixes of what was wrong  especially with the financial and banking systems  Roosevelt s series of radio talks  known as fireside chats  presented his proposals directly to the American public  75  In 1934 FDR paid a visit to retired Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes  who mused about the President   A second class intellect  But a first class temperament   76  First New Deal  1933 1934 Roosevelt s  First 100 Days  concentrated on the first part of his strategy  immediate relief  From March 9 to June 16  1933  he sent Congress a record number of bills  all of which passed easily  To propose programs  Roosevelt relied on leading Senators such as George Norris  Robert F  Wagner and Hugo Black  as well as his Brain Trust of academic advisers  Like Hoover  he saw the Depression caused in part by people no longer spending or investing because they were afraid  His inauguration on March 4  1933  occurred in the middle of a bank panic  hence the backdrop for his famous words   The only thing we have to fear is fear itself   74  The very next day Congress passed the Emergency Banking Act which declared a  bank holiday  and announced a plan to allow banks to reopen  77  This was his first proposed step to recovery  To give Americans confidence in the banks  Roosevelt signed the Glass Steagall Act that created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  FDIC    Nothing to Fear  Sample of the Inaugural speech from FDR Problems listening to this file  See media help  Relief measures included the continuation of Hoover s major relief program for the unemployed under the new name  Federal Emergency Relief Administration  The most popular of all New Deal agencies   and Roosevelt s favorite   was the Civilian Conservation Corps  CCC   which hired 250 000 unemployed young men to work on rural local projects  Congress also gave the Federal Trade Commission broad new regulatory powers and provided mortgage relief to millions of farmers and homeowners  Roosevelt expanded a Hoover agency  the Reconstruction Finance Corporation  making it a major source of financing for railroads and industry  Roosevelt made agricultural relief a high priority and set up the first Agricultural Adjustment Administration  AAA   The AAA tried to force higher prices for commodities by paying farmers to take land out of crops and to cut herds  Reform of the economy was the goal of the National Industrial Recovery Act  NIRA  of 1933  It tried to end cutthroat competition by forcing industries to come up with codes that established the rules of operation for all firms within specific industries  such as minimum prices  agreements not to compete  and production restrictions  Industry leaders negotiated the codes which were then approved by NIRA officials  Industry needed to raise wages as a condition for approval  Provisions encouraged unions and suspended anti trust laws  The NIRA was found to be unconstitutional by unanimous decision of the U S  Supreme Court on May 27  1935  Roosevelt opposed the decision  saying  The fundamental purposes and principles of the NIRA are sound  To abandon them is unthinkable  It would spell the return to industrial and labor chaos   78  In 1933  major new banking regulations were passed  In 1934  the Securities and Exchange Commission was created to regulate Wall Street  with 1932 campaign fundraiser Joseph P  Kennedy in charge  Recovery was pursued through  pump priming   that is  federal spending   The NIRA included  3 3 billion of spending through the Public Works Administration to stimulate the economy  which was to be handled by Interior Secretary Harold Ickes  Roosevelt worked with Republican Senator George Norris to create the largest government owned industrial enterprise in American history  the Tennessee Valley Authority  TVA   which built dams and power stations  controlled floods  and modernized agriculture and home conditions in the poverty stricken Tennessee Valley  The repeal of prohibition also brought in new tax revenues and helped Roosevelt keep a major campaign promise  Executive Order 6102 made all privately held gold of American citizens was to be sold to the U S  Treasury and the price raised from  20 to  35 per ounce  79  Exceptions were made for jewelers  coin collectors and a few others  The goal was to counter the deflation which was paralyzing the economy  80  Roosevelt tried to keep his campaign promise by cutting the federal budget  including a reduction in military spending from  752 million in 1932 to  531 million in 1934 and a 40  cuts in spending on veterans  benefits  removed 500 000 veterans and widows from the pension rolls and reduced benefits for the remainder  as well as cutting the salaries of federal employees and reduced spending on research and education  81  However  this was soon seen to be a mistake and most benefits were restored or increased by 1934  82  The benefit cuts also did not last  In June 1933 Roosevelt restored  50 million in pension payments  and Congress added another  46 million more  83  Veterans groups like the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars won their campaign to transform their benefits from payments due in 1945 to immediate cash when Congress overrode the President s veto and passed the Bonus Act in January 1936  84  Roosevelt also kept his promise to push for repeal of Prohibition  In April 1933  he issued an Executive Order redefining 3 2  alcohol as the maximum allowed  citation needed  That order was preceded by Congressional action in the drafting and passage of the 21st Amendment  which was ratified later that year  Second New Deal  1935 1936 After the 1934 Congressional elections  which gave Roosevelt large majorities in both houses  there was a fresh surge of New Deal legislation  These measures included the Works Progress Administration  WPA  which set up a national relief agency that employed two million family heads  At the height of WPA employment in 1938  unemployment was down from 20 6  in 1933 to only12 5  according to figures from Michael Darby  85  The Social Security Act  established Social Security and promised economic security for the elderly  the poor and the sick  Senator Robert Wagner wrote the Wagner Act  which officially became the National Labor Relations Act  The act established the federal rights of workers to organize unions  to engage in collective bargaining  and to take part in strikes  While the First New Deal of 1933 had broad support from most sectors  the Second New Deal challenged the business community  Conservative Democrats  led by Al Smith  fought back with the American Liberty League  savagely attacking Roosevelt and equating him with Marx and Lenin  86  But Smith overplayed his hand  and his boisterous rhetoric let Roosevelt isolate his opponents and identify them with the wealthy vested interests that opposed the New Deal  setting Roosevelt up for the 1936 landslide  87  By contrast  the labor unions  energized by the Wagner Act  signed up millions of new members and became a major backer of Roosevelt s reelections in 1936  1940 and 1944  88  Some historians disagree with the prevailing belief that there were two New Deals in the Roosevelt administration  89  They argue that there is no evidence of any such blueprint for Roosevelt s programs  these contrarians assert that abundant evidence shows FDR s policies were formulated and executed haphazardly  and fluctuated in the hands of a revolving cast of presidential advisors  90  Biographer James M  Burns as well indicates Roosevelt s policy decisions were replete with sudden reversals  and that FDR was  like the general of a guerilla army  fighting blindly through a jungle   91  Schweikart and Allen maintain that the two New Deals concept serves well to explain away the ineffectiveness of FDR s programs to improve the nation s economy and contradictory decisions by FDR in his first six years in office  90  Economic environment See also  Great Depression in the United States Effects Government spending increased from 8 0  of gross national product  GNP  under Hoover in 1932 to 10 2  of the GNP in 1936  The national debt as a percentage of the GNP had more that doubled under Hoover from 16  to 40  of the GNP in early 1933  It held steady at close to 40  as late as fall 1941  then grew rapidly during the war  as shown on chart 1  92  National debt steady at 40  of GNP in New Deal years Deficit spending had been recommended by some economists  most notably by John Maynard Keynes of Britain  The GNP was 34  higher in 1936 than in 1932 and 58  higher in 1940 on the eve of war  That is  the economy grew 58  from 1932 to 1940 in 8 years of peacetime  and then grew 56  from 1940 to 1945 in 5 years of wartime  Unemployment fell dramatically in Roosevelt s first term  from 25  when he took office to 14 3  in 1937  However  it increased slightly to 19 0  in 1938   a depression within a depression   and fell to 17 2  in 1939  and then dropped again to 14 6  in 1940 until it reached 1 9  in 1945 due to World War II when increased manufacturing and conscription decreased the labor supply number  93  94  Total employment during Roosevelt s term expanded by 18 31 million jobs  with an average annual increase in jobs during his administration of 5 3   95  96  During the war  the economy operated under such different conditions that comparison with peacetime is impossible  However  Roosevelt saw the New Deal policies as central to his legacy  and in his 1944 State of the Union Address  he advocated that Americans should think of basic economic rights as a Second Bill of Rights  Roosevelt did not raise income taxes before World War II began  however payroll taxes were also introduced to fund the new Social Security program in 1937  He also got Congress to spend more on many various programs and projects never before seen in American history  However  under the revenue pressures brought on by the depression  most states added or increased taxes  including sales as well as income taxes  Roosevelt s proposal for new taxes on corporate savings were highly controversial in 1936 37  and were rejected by Congress  During the war he pushed for even higher income tax rates for individuals  reaching a marginal tax rate of 91   and corporations and a cap on high salaries for executives  He also issued Executive Order 9250 in October 1942  later to be rescinded by Congress  which raised the marginal tax rate for salaries exceeding  25 000  after tax  to 100   thereby limiting salaries to  25 000  about  356 000 today   97  98  99  To fund the war  Congress broadened the base so that almost every employee paid federal income taxes  and introduced withholding taxes in 1943  GDP in United States January 1929 to January

policy  Despite Roosevelt s Wilsonian background  he and Secretary of State Cordell Hull acted with great care not to provoke isolationist sentiment  Roosevelt s  bombshell  message to the world monetary conference in 1933 effectively ended any major efforts by the world powers to collaborate on ending the worldwide depression  and allowed Roosevelt a free hand in economic policy  101  Roosevelt was a lifelong free trader and anti imperialist  Ending European colonialism was one of his objectives  102  The main foreign policy initiative of Roosevelt s first term was the Good Neighbor Policy  which was a re evaluation of U S  policy towards Latin America  Since the Monroe Doctrine of 1823  this area had been seen as an American sphere of influence  American forces were withdrawn from Haiti  and new treaties with Cuba and Panama ended their status as United States protectorates  In December 1933  Roosevelt signed the Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States  renouncing the right to intervene unilaterally in the affairs of Latin American countries  103  The isolationist movement was bolstered in the early to mid 1930s by U S  Senator Gerald Nye and others who succeeded in their effort to stop the  merchants of death  in the U S  from selling arms abroad  104  This effort took the form of the Neutrality Acts  the president asked for  but was refused  a provision to give him the discretion to allow the sale of arms to victims of aggression  105  In the interim  Italy and Mussolini proceeded to overcome Ethiopia and the Italians joined the Germans in co opting a successful revolt in Spain  106  In 1936 Germany and Japan signed their Anti Comintern Pact  allowing their Axis to develop united strategies  107  And thus the congress passed and the president signed a mandatory arms embargo at a time when dictators in Europe and Asia were girding for world war  108  Landslide re election  1936 Main article  United States presidential election  1936 In the 1936 presidential election  Roosevelt campaigned on his New Deal programs against Kansas Governor Alf Landon  who accepted much of the New Deal but objected that it was hostile to business and involved too much waste  Roosevelt and Garner won 60 8  of the vote and carried every state except Maine and Vermont  109  The New Deal Democrats won even larger majorities in Congress  Roosevelt was backed by a coalition of voters which included traditional Democrats across the country  small farmers  the  Solid South   Catholics  big city political machines  labor unions  northern African Americans  Jews  intellectuals and political liberals  This coalition  frequently referred to as the New Deal coalition  remained largely intact for the Democratic Party until the 1960s  110  Roosevelt s popularity meant massive volumes of correspondence in need of reply  He once told his son James   Two short sentences will generally answer any known letter   111  Second term  1937 1941 In contrast to the first term  little major legislation was passed in FDR s second term  There was the Housing Act of 1937  a second Agricultural Adjustment Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act  FLSA  of 1938  which created the minimum wage  When the economy began to deteriorate again in late 1937  Roosevelt asked Congress for  5 billion in WPA relief and public works funding  This managed to eventually create as many as 3 3 million WPA jobs by 1938  Beyond this  however  the president only recommended to a special congressional session a permanent national farm act  administrative reorganization and regional planning measures  which were leftovers from a regular session  According to Burns  this attempt illustrated Roosevelt s inability to decide on a basic economic program  112  The Supreme Court became Roosevelt s primary focus during his second term  after the court overturned many of his programs  In particular in 1935 the Court unanimously ruled that the National Recovery Act  NRA  was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the president  Roosevelt stunned Congress in early 1937 by proposing a law allowing him to appoint up to six new justices  what he referred to as a  persistent infusion of new blood   113  This  court packing  plan ran into intense political opposition from his own party  led by Vice President Garner  since it upset the separation of powers and gave the President control over the Court  Roosevelt s proposal to expand the court failed  114  nevertheless by 1941 Roosevelt had appointed eight of the nine justices of the court which began to ratify his policies  115  116  Roosevelt had massive support from the rapidly growing labor unions  but now they split into bitterly feuding AFL and CIO factions  the latter led by John L  Lewis  Roosevelt pronounced a  plague on both your houses   but labor s disunity weakened the party in the elections from 1938 through 1946  117  Determined to overcome the opposition of conservative Democrats in Congress  mostly from the South   Roosevelt involved himself in the 1938 Democratic primaries  actively campaigning for challengers who were more supportive of New Deal reform  His targets denounced Roosevelt for trying to take over the Democratic party and used the argument that they were independent to win reelection  Roosevelt failed badly  managing to defeat only one target  a conservative Democrat from New York City  118  In the November 1938 election  Democrats lost six Senate seats and 71 House seats  Losses were concentrated among pro New Deal Democrats  When Congress reconvened in 1939  Republicans under Senator Robert Taft formed a Conservative coalition with Southern Democrats  virtually ending Roosevelt s ability to get his domestic proposals enacted into law  The minimum wage law of 1938 was the last substantial New Deal reform act passed by Congress  119  Foreign policy  1937 1941 Roosevelt welcomed Manuel L  Quezon  the 2nd President of the Philippines  in Washington The rise to power of dictator Adolf Hitler in Germany had aroused fears of a new world war  Nevertheless  in 1937 Congress passed an even more stringent Neutrality act  But when the Sino Japanese War broke out that year  public opinion favored China  and Roosevelt found various ways to assist that nation  120  In October 1937  he gave the Quarantine Speech aiming to contain aggressor nations  He proposed that warmongering states be treated as a public health menace and be  quarantined   121  Meanwhile he secretly stepped up a program to build long range submarines that could blockade Japan  122  At the time of the Munich Agreement in 1938 with the U S  not represented Roosevelt said the U S  would not join a  stop Hitler bloc  under any circumstances  and he made it quite clear in the event of German aggression against Czechoslovakia  the U S  would remain neutral  123  124  Roosevelt said in 1939 that France and Britain were America s  first line of defence  and needed American aid  but because of widespread isolationist sentiment he reiterated the U S  would not itself go to war  125  In the spring of 1939 FDR allowed the French to place huge orders with the American aircraft industry on a cash and carry basis  as allowed by law  Most of the aircraft ordered had not arrived in France by the time of its collapse in May 1940  so Roosevelt arranged in June 1940 for French orders to be sold to the British  126  When World War II broke out in 1939  Roosevelt rejected the Wilsonian neutrality stance and sought ways to assist Britain and France militarily  127  At first the President gave only covert support to repeal of the arms embargo provisions of the Neutrality Act  128  He began a regular secret correspondence with the First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill in September 1939 discussing ways of supporting Britain  Roosevelt forged a close personal relationship with Churchill  who became Prime Minister of Britain in May 1940  In April 1940 Germany invaded Denmark and Norway  followed by invasions of the Netherlands  Belgium  Luxembourg and France in May  The German victories left Britain vulnerable to invasion  Roosevelt  who was determined that Britain not be defeated  took advantage of the rapid shifts of public opinion  The fall of Paris shocked American opinion  and isolationist sentiment declined  A consensus was clear that military spending had to be dramatically expanded  There was no consensus on how much the U S  should risk war in helping Britain  129  In July 1940  FDR appointed two interventionist Republican leaders  Henry L  Stimson and Frank Knox  as Secretaries of War and the Navy respectively  Both parties gave support to his plans to rapidly build up the American military  but the isolationists warned that Roosevelt would get the nation into an unnecessary war with Germany  130  Congress set up the nation s first peacetime draft  131  Foreign trips of Franklin D  Roosevelt during his presidency  Roosevelt used his personal charisma to build support for intervention  America should be the  Arsenal of Democracy   he told his fireside audience  132  On September 2  1940  Roosevelt openly defied the Neutrality Acts by passing the Destroyers for Bases Agreement  which  in exchange for military base rights in the British Caribbean Islands  gave 50 WWI American destroyers to Britain  The U S  also received free base rights in Bermuda and Newfoundland  allowing British forces to be moved to the sharper end of the war  the idea of an exchange of warships for bases such as these originated in the cabinet  133  Hitler and Mussolini responded to the deal by joining with Japan in the Tripartite Pact  134  The agreement with Britain was a precursor of the March 1941 Lend Lease agreement which began to direct massive military and economic aid to Britain  the Republic of China  and later the Soviet Union  For foreign policy advice  Roosevelt turned to Harry Hopkins  who became his chief wartime advisor  They sought innovative ways to help Britain  whose financial resources were exhausted by the end of 1940  short of going to war  135  Congress  where isolationist sentiment was waning  passed the Lend Lease Act in March 1941  allowing the U S  to give Britain  China and later the Soviet Union military supplies  The legislation had hit a logjam until Sens  Byrd  Byrnes and Taft added a provision subjecting it to appropriation by Congress  136  Congress voted to commit to spend  50 billion on military supplies from 1941 to 1945  In sharp contrast to the loans of World War I  there would be no repayment after the war  Until late in 1941  FDR refused Churchill s urgent requests for armed escort of ships bound for Britain  insisting on a more passive patrolling function in the western Atlantic  137  Election of 1940 Main article  United States presidential election  1940 The two term tradition had been an unwritten rule  until the 22nd Amendment after his presidency  since George Washington declined to run for a third term in 1796  and both Ulysses S  Grant and Theodore Roosevelt were attacked for trying to obtain a third non consecutive term  FDR systematically undercut prominent Democrats who were angling for the nomination  including two cabinet members  Secretary of State Cordell Hull and James Farley  Roosevelt s campaign manager in 1932 and 1936  Postmaster General and Democratic Party chairman  Roosevelt moved the convention to Chicago where he had strong support from the city machine  which controlled the auditorium sound system   At the convention the opposition was poorly organized but Farley had packed the galleries  Roosevelt sent a message saying that he would not run  unless he was drafted  and that the delegates were free to vote for anyone  The delegates were stunned  then the loudspeaker screamed  We want Roosevelt    The world wants Roosevelt   The delegates went wild and he was nominated by 946 to 147 on the first ballot  The tactic employed by Roosevelt was not entirely successful  as his goal had been to be drafted by acclamation  138  The new vice presidential nominee was Henry A  Wallace  a liberal intellectual who was Secretary of Agriculture  139  In his campaign against Republican Wendell Willkie  Roosevelt stressed both his proven leadership experience and his intention to do everything possible to keep the United States out of war  In one of his speeches he declared to potential recruits that  you boys are not going to be sent into any foreign war   140  He won the 1940 election with 55  of the popular vote and 38 of the 48 states  141  A shift to the left within the Administration was shown by the naming of Henry A  Wallace as Vice President in place of the conservative Texan John Nance Garner  who had become a bitter enemy of Roosevelt after 1937  Third term  1941 1945 Policies State of the Union  Four Freedoms   January 6  1941  Franklin Delano Roosevelt s January 6  1941 State of the Union Address introducing the theme of the Four Freedoms  starting at 32 02  Problems listening to this file  See media help  Roosevelt s third term was dominated by World War II  Roosevelt slowly began re armament in 1938 though he was facing strong isolationist sentiment from leaders like Senators William Borah and Robert Taft  By 1940  it was in high gear  with bipartisan support  partly to expand and re equip the Army and Navy and partly to become the  Arsenal of Democracy  supporting Britain  France  China and  after June 1941   the Soviet Union  As Roosevelt took a firmer stance against the Axis Powers  American isolationists including Charles Lindbergh and America First vehemently attacked the President as an irresponsible warmonger  142  Roosevelt initiated FBI and Internal Revenue Service investigations of his loudest critics  though no legal actions resulted  143  Unfazed by these criticisms and confident in the wisdom of his foreign policy initiatives  FDR continued his twin policies of preparedness and aid to the Allied coalition  On December 29  1940  he delivered his Arsenal of Democracy fireside chat  in which he made the case for involvement in the war directly to the American people  And a week later he delivered his famous Four Freedoms speech laying out the case for an American defense of basic rights throughout the world  Roosevelt and Winston Churchill aboard HMS Prince of Wales for 1941 Atlantic Charter meeting  The homefront was subject to dynamic social changes throughout the war  though domestic issues were no longer Roosevelt s most urgent policy concern  The military buildup spurred economic growth  By 1941  unemployment had fallen to under 1 million  There was a growing labor shortage  accelerating the Great Migration of African Americans  farmers and rural populations to manufacturing centers  To pay for increased government spending  in 1941 FDR proposed that Congress enact an income tax rate of 99 5  on all income over  100 000  when the proposal failed  he issued an executive order imposing an income tax of 100  on income over  25 000  which Congress rescinded  144  When Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941  Roosevelt agreed to extend Lend Lease to the Soviets  Thus  Roosevelt had committed the U S  to the Allied side with a policy of  all aid short of war   145  Execution of the aid fell victim to foot dragging in the administration so FDR appointed a special assistant  Wayne Coy  to expedite matters  146  Later that year a German submarine fired on the U S  destroyer Greer and Roosevelt declared that the U S  Navy would assume an escort role for Allied convoys in the Atlantic as far east as Great Britain and would fire upon German ships or submarines  U boats  of the Kriegsmarine if they entered the U S  Navy zone  This  shoot on sight  policy effectively declared Naval war on Germany and was favored by Americans by a margin of 2 to 1  147  Roosevelt and Churchill conducted a highly secret bilateral meeting in Argentia  Newfoundland  and on August 14  1941  concluded their Atlantic Charter  conceptually outlining global goals following the war  this was the first of several wartime conferences  148  In July 1941  Roosevelt had ordered Henry Stimson  Secretary of War to begin planning for total American military involvement  The resulting  Victory Program   under the direction of Albert Wedemeyer  provided the President with the estimates necessary for the total mobilization of manpower  industry  and logistics to defeat the  potential enemies  of the United States  The program also planned to dramatically increase aid to the Allied nations and to have ten million men in arms  half of whom would be ready for deployment abroad in 1943  Roosevelt was firmly committed to the Allied cause and these plans had been formulated before the Attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan  145  Congress was debating a modification of The Neutrality Act in October 1941  when the USS Kearny  along with other ships  engaged a number of U boats south of Iceland  the Kearny took fire and lost eleven crewmen  As a result  The Neutrality Act to permit the arming of the merchant marine passed both houses  though by a slim margin  149  In 1942  war production increased dramatically  but fell short of the goals established by the President  due in part to manpower shortages  150  The effort was also hindered by numerous strikes by union workers  especially in the coal mining and railroad industries  which lasted well into 1944  151  The White House became the ultimate site for labor mediation  conciliation or arbitration  152  One particular battle royal occurred  between Vice President Wallace  who headed the BEW  and Jesse Jones  in charge of the RFC  both agencies assumed responsibility for acquisition of rubber supplies and came to loggerheads over funding  FDR resolved the dispute by dissolving both agencies  153  In 1944 the President requested Congress enact legislation which would tax all unreasonable profits  both corporate and individual  and thereby support his declared need for over ten billion in revenue for the war and other government measures  The Congress passed a revenue bill raising 2 billion  which FDR vetoed  though Congress in turn overrode

1940  FDR authorized increased aid to the Republic of China  a policy that won widespread popular support  In July 1941  after Japan occupied the remainder of Indo China  he cut off the sale of oil to Japan which thus lost more than 95 percent of its oil supply  Roosevelt continued negotiations with the Japanese government  primarily through Secretary Hull  Japan Premier Konoye desired a Pacific conference with FDR which U S  Ambassador Joseph Grew favored  but which Hull opposed  When Kenoye failed to produce diplomatic results  Emperor Hirohito replaced him with Minister of War Tojo  155  Meanwhile  Roosevelt started sending long range B 17 bombers to the Pacific  FDR felt that an attack by the Japanese was probable   most likely in the Dutch East Indies or Thailand  156  On December 4  1941  The Chicago Tribune published the complete text of  Rainbow Five   a top secret war plan drawn up by the War Department  It dealt chiefly with mobilization issues  calling for a 10 million man army  The great majority of scholars have rejected the conspiracy thesis that Roosevelt  or any other high government officials  knew in advance about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor  The Japanese had done a very good job in keeping their secrets  All senior American officials were aware that war was imminent  but none expected an attack on Pearl Harbor  157  On December 7  1941  the Japanese attacked the U S  Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor  destroying or damaging 16 warships  including most of the fleet s battleships  and killing almost 3000 American military personnel and civilians  Later that day  FDR called Churchill to confirm the news  saying  We are all in the same boat now   158  The President summoned his cabinet to assess events and to review a draft of his speech the next day to Congress  He rejected a suggestion for requesting a declaration of war against Germany in addition to Japan  159  Roosevelt  seeking a declaration of war against Japan  then delivered to Congress his famous  Infamy Speech  in which he said   Yesterday  December 7  1941   a date which will live in infamy   the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan   Within an hour of the speech  Congress had passed a declaration of war  as Britain had just hours earlier  160  In 1942 Roosevelt set up a new military command structure with Admiral Ernest J  King as Chief of Naval Operations in complete control of the Navy and Marines  General George C  Marshall in charge of the Army  and in nominal control of the Air Force  which in practice was commanded by General Hap Arnold  Roosevelt formed a new body  the Joint Chiefs of Staff  which made the final decisions on American military strategy  161  The Joint Chiefs was a White House agency and was chaired by Admiral William D  Leahy  but as the war progressed  Marshall increasingly dominated its deliberations  When dealing with Europe  the Joint Chiefs met with their British counterparts and formed the Combined Chiefs of Staff  162  Unlike the political leaders of the other major powers  Roosevelt rarely overrode his military advisors  163  His civilian appointees handled the draft and procurement of men and equipment  but no civilians not even the secretaries of War or Navy  had a voice in strategy  164  Roosevelt avoided the State Department and conducted high level diplomacy through his aides  especially Harry Hopkins  Since Hopkins also controlled  50 billion in Lend Lease funds given to the Allies  they paid attention to him  165  War plans Roosevelt and his military advisors implemented a war strategy with the objectives of halting the German advances in the Soviet Union and in North Africa  launching an invasion of western Europe with the aim of crushing Nazi Germany between two fronts  and saving China and defeating Japan  Public opinion  however  gave priority to the destruction of Japan  so American forces were sent chiefly to the Pacific in 1942  166  In the opening weeks of the war  Japan had conquered the Philippines  and the British and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia  capturing Singapore in February 1942  Furthermore Japan defeated the Allied Forces in Burma and advanced almost to the borders of Bengal in India  thus cutting off the overland supply route to China  After Pearl Harbor antiwar sentiment in the United States evaporated overnight  On December 11  1941  Germany and Italy declared war on the United States  which responded in kind  167  Roosevelt met with Churchill in late December and planned a broad informal alliance among the U S   Britain  China and the Soviet Union  This included Churchill s initial plan to invade North Africa  called Operation Gymnast  and the primary plan of the U S  generals for a western Europe invasion  focused directly on Germany  Operation Sledgehammer   An agreement was also reached for a centralized command and offensive in the Pacific theater called ABDA  American  British  Dutch  Australian  to save China and defeat Japan  Nevertheless  the Atlantic First strategy was intact  to Churchill s great satisfaction  168  On New Years Day 1942 Churchill and FDR issued the  Declaration by United Nations   representing 26 countries in opposition to the Tripartite Pact of Germany  Italy and Japan  169  Internment of Germans  Japanese and Italians Main articles  German American internment  Japanese American internment  and Italian American internment When the war began the danger of a Japanese attack on the coast led to growing pressure to remove people of Japanese descent away from the coastal region  This pressure grew due to fears of terrorism  espionage  and or sabotage  On February 19  1942  President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 which relocated the  Issei   first generation of Japanese immigrants who did not have U S  citizenship  and their children   Nisei   who had dual citizenship   After both Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy declared war on the United States in December 1941  German and Italian citizens who had not taken out American citizenship and who spoke out for Hitler and Mussolini were often arrested or interned  War strategy Roosevelt and Churchill at Casablanca Conference in early 1943 The  Big Three   Roosevelt  Churchill  and Joseph Stalin   together with Generalissimo Chiang Kai shek cooperated informally on a plan in which American and British troops concentrated in the West  Soviet troops fought on the Eastern front  and Chinese  British and American troops fought in Asia and the Pacific  The Allies formulated strategy in a series of high profile conferences as well as contact through diplomatic and military channels  Roosevelt guaranteed that the U S  would be the  Arsenal of Democracy  by shipping  50 billion of Lend Lease supplies  primarily to Britain and to the USSR  China and other Allies  Roosevelt acknowledged that Americans had a traditional antipathy towards the British Empire  saying   It s in the American tradition  this distrust  this dislike and even hatred of Britain  the Revolution  you know  and 1812  and India and the Boer War  and all that  There are many kinds of Americans of course  but as a people  as a country  we re opposed to Imperialism we can t stomach it   170  The U S  War Department believed that the quickest way to defeat Germany was to invade France across the English Channel  Churchill  wary of the casualties he feared this would entail  favored a more indirect approach  advancing northwards from the Mediterranean Sea  Roosevelt rejected this plan  Stalin advocated opening a Western front at the earliest possible time  as the bulk of the land fighting in 1942 44 was on Soviet soil  In May 1942 Stalin s Minister of Foreign Affairs Vyacheslav Molotov met with Roosevelt in Washington and got from FDR a commitment to the opening of a second war front in 1942 against the Germans  by way of England  Shortly thereafter a postponement of this became necessary  and Churchill carried the news to Stalin in Moscow  171  In October 1942  the President was advised that military resources were desperately needed at Guadalcanal to prevent overrunning by the Japanese  FDR heeded the advice  redirected armaments and the Japanese Pacific offensive was stalled  172  Generalissimo Chiang Kai shek of China  left   Roosevelt  middle   and Winston Churchill  right  at the Cairo Conference in December of 1943 The Allies undertook the invasions of French Morocco and Algeria  Operation Torch  in November 1942  FDR very much desired the assault be initiated before election day  but did not order it  FDR and Churchill had another war conference in Casablanca in January 1943  Stalin declined an invitation  The Allies agreed strategically that the Mediterranean focus be continued  with the cross channel invasion coming later  followed by concentration of efforts in the Pacific  173  Hitler reinforced his military in North Africa  with the result that the Allied efforts there suffered a temporary setback  Allied attempts to counterbalance this were successful  but resulted in war supplies to the USSR being delayed  as well as the second war front  174  Later  their assault pursued into Sicily  Operation Husky  followed in July 1943  and of Italy  Operation Avalanche  in September 1943  In 1943 it was apparent to FDR that Stalin  while bearing the brunt of Germany s offensive  had not had sufficient opportunity to participate in war conferences  The President made a concerted effort to arrange a one on one meeting with Stalin  in Fairbanks  However  when Stalin learned that Roosevelt and Churchill had postponed the cross channel invasion a second time  he cancelled  175  The strategic bombing campaign was escalated in 1944  pulverizing all major German cities and cutting off oil supplies  It was a 50 50 British American operation  Roosevelt picked Dwight D  Eisenhower  and not George Marshall  to head the Allied cross channel invasion  Operation Overlord that began on D Day  June 6  1944  Some of the most costly battles of the war ensued after the invasion  and the Allies were blocked on the German border in the  Battle of the Bulge  in December 1944  When Roosevelt died on April 12  1945  Allied forces were closing in on Berlin  Meanwhile  in the Pacific  the Japanese advance reached its maximum extent by June 1942  when the U S  Navy scored a decisive victory at the Battle of Midway  American and Australian forces then began a slow and costly progress called island hopping or leapfrogging through the Pacific Islands  with the objective of gaining bases from which strategic airpower could be brought to bear on Japan and from which Japan could ultimately be invaded  In contrast to Hitler  Roosevelt took no direct part in the tactical naval operations  though he approved strategic decisions  176  FDR gave way in part to insistent demands from the public and Congress that more effort be devoted against Japan  he always insisted on Germany first  Post war planning Further information  Tehran Conference and Yalta Conference Churchill  FDR  and Stalin at Yalta  By late 1943  it was apparent that the Allies would ultimately defeat the enemy so it became increasingly important to make high level political decisions about the course of the war and the postwar future of Europe  Roosevelt met with Churchill and the Chinese leader Chiang Kai shek at the Cairo Conference in November 1943  and then went to the Tehran Conference to confer with Churchill and Stalin  While Churchill warned of potential domination by a Stalin dictatorship over eastern Europe  Roosevelt responded with a statement summarizing his rationale for relations with Stalin   I just have a hunch that Stalin is not that kind of a man        I think that if I give him everything I possibly can and ask for nothing from him in return  noblesse oblige  he won t try to annex anything and will work with me for a world of democracy and peace   177  At the Tehran Conference  Roosevelt and Churchill discussed plans for a postwar international organization  For his part  Stalin insisted on redrawing the frontiers of Poland  Stalin supported Roosevelt s plan for the United Nations and promised to enter the war against Japan 90 days after Germany was defeated  By the beginning of 1945  however  with the Allied armies advancing into Germany and the Soviets in control of Poland  the postwar issues came into the open  In February  Roosevelt traveled to Yalta  in the Soviet Crimea  to meet again with Stalin and Churchill  While Roosevelt maintained his confidence that Stalin would keep his Yalta promises regarding free elections in eastern Europe  one month after Yalta ended  Roosevelt s Ambassador to the USSR Averell Harriman cabled Roosevelt that  we must come clearly to realize that the Soviet program is the establishment of totalitarianism  ending personal liberty and democracy as we know it   178  Two days later  Roosevelt began to admit that his view of Stalin had been excessively optimistic and that  Averell is right   178  Declining health Roosevelt  who turned 62 in 1944  had been in declining health since at least 1940  Noticeably fatigued  in March 1944  he went to Bethesda Hospital for tests  the results of which were startling  The strain of his paralysis and the physical exertion needed to compensate for it for over 20 years had taken their toll  as had many years of stress and smoking  The tests showed Roosevelt had numerous ailments including chronic high blood pressure  systemic atherosclerosis  coronary artery disease with angina pectoris  and myopathic hypertensive heart disease with congestive heart failure  179  180  181  Election of 1944 Main article  United States presidential election  1944 Party leaders insisted that Roosevelt drop Henry A  Wallace  who had been erratic as Vice President and was too pro Soviet  James F  Byrnes of South Carolina  a top FDR aide  was considered ineligible because he had left the Catholic Church and Catholic voters would not accept him  Roosevelt replaced Wallace with Missouri Senator Harry S  Truman  best known for his battle against corruption and inefficiency in wartime spending  The Republicans nominated Thomas E  Dewey  the liberal governor of New York  The opposition lambasted FDR and his administration for domestic corruption  bureaucratic inefficiency  tolerance of Communism  and military blunders  Labor unions  which had grown rapidly in the war  threw their all out support behind Roosevelt  In a relatively close 1944 election  Roosevelt and Truman won 53  of the vote and carried 36 states  182  The President campaigned in favor of a strong United Nations  so his victory symbolized support for the nation s future participation in the international community  183  Due to the President s health and the ongoing state of war  the President s fourth inauguration was held on the White House lawn  184  Fourth term and death  1945 Last days  death and memorial The President left the Yalta Conference on February 12  1945  and flew to Egypt and boarded the USS Quincy operating on the Great Bitter Lake near the Suez Canal  Aboard Quincy  the next day he met with Farouk I  king of Egypt  and Haile Selassie  emperor of Ethiopia  On February 14  he held a historic meeting with King Abdulaziz  the founder of Saudi Arabia  a meeting some historians believe holds profound significance in U S  Saudi relations even today  185  After a final meeting between Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill  Quincy steamed for Algiers  arriving February 18  at which time Roosevelt conferred with American ambassadors to Britain  France and Italy  186  At Yalta  Lord Moran  Winston Churchill s physician  commenting on Roosevelt s ill health  said that he was a dying man  187  Roosevelt meets with King Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia onboard the USS Quincy at the Great Bitter Lake When he returned to the United States  he addressed Congress on March 1 about the Yalta Conference  188  and many were shocked to see how old  thin and frail he looked  He spoke while seated in the well of the House  an unprecedented concession to his physical incapacity  Roosevelt opened his speech by saying   I hope that you will pardon me for this unusual posture of sitting down during the presentation of what I want to say  but   it makes it a lot easier for me not to have to carry about ten pounds of steel around on the bottom of my legs   Still in full command mentally  he firmly stated  The Crimean Conference ought to spell the end of a system of unilateral action  the exclusive alliances  the spheres of influence  the balances of power  and all the other expedients that have been tried for centuries  and have always failed  We propose to substitute for all these  a universal organization in which all peace loving nations will finally have a chance to join   189  During March 1945  he sent strongly worded messages to Stalin accusing him of breaking his Yalta commitments over Poland  Germany  prisoners of war and other issues  When Stalin accused the western Allies of plotting a separate peace with Hitler behind his back  Roosevelt replied   I cannot avoid a feeling of bitter resentment towards your informers  whoever they are  for such vile misrepresentations of my actions or those of my trusted subordinates   190  On March 29  1945  Roosevelt went to the Little White House at Warm Springs  Georgia to rest before his anticipated appearance at the founding conference of the United Nations  On the afternoon of April 12  Roosevelt said   I have a terrific pain in the back of my head   He then slumped forward in his chair  unconscious  and was carried into his bedroom  The president s attending cardiologist  Dr  Howard Bruenn  diagnosed a massive cerebral hemorrhage  stroke   191  At 3 35 pm that day  Roosevelt died  As Allen Drury later said   so ended an era  and so began another   After Roosevelt s death an editorial by The New York Times declared   Men will thank God on their knees a hundred years from now that Franklin D  Roosevelt was in the White House   192  At the time he collapsed  Roosevelt had been sitting for a portrait painting by the artist Elizabeth Shoumatoff  known as the famous Unfinished Portrait of FDR  Roosevelt s horse drawn casket proceeds down Pennsylvania Avenue during his funeral procession  In his later years at the White House  Roosevelt was increasingly overworked and his daughter Anna Roosevelt Boettiger had moved in to provide her father companionship and support  Anna had also arranged for her father to meet with his former mistress  the now widowed Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd  Shoumatoff  who maintained close friendships with both Roosevelt and Mercer  rushed Mercer away to avoid negative publicity and implications of infidelity  When Eleanor heard about her husband s death  she was also faced with the news that Anna had been arranging these meetings with Mercer and that Mercer had been with Franklin when he died  On the morning of April 13  Roosevelt s body was placed in a flag draped coffin and loaded onto the presidential train  After a White House funeral on April 14  Roosevelt was transported back to Hyde Park by train  guarded by four servicemen  one each from the Army  Navy  Marines  and Coast Guard  As was his wish  Roosevelt was buried in the Rose Garden of the Springwood estate  the Roosevelt family home in Hyde Park on April 15  Eleanor  who died in November 1962  was buried next to him  Roosevelt s death was met with shock and grief 193  across the U S  and around the world  His declining health had not been known to the general public  Roosevelt had been president for more than 12 years  longer than any other person  and had led the country through some of its greatest crises to the impending defeat of Nazi Germany and within sight of the defeat of Japan as well  Less than a month after his death  on May 8  the war in Europe ended  President Harry Truman  who turned 61 that day  dedicated Victory in Europe Day and its celebrations to Roosevelt s memory  and kept the flags across the U S  at half staff for the remainder of the 30 day mourning period  In doing so  Truman said that his only wish was  that Franklin D  Roosevelt had lived to witness this day   194  Administration  Cabinet  and Supreme Court appointments 1933 1945 Main article  Franklin D

President except George Washington  who appointed ten  By 1941  eight of the nine Justices were Roosevelt appointees  Harlan Fiske Stone was elevated to Chief Justice from the position of Associate Justice by Roosevelt  Roosevelt s appointees would not share ideologies  and some  like Hugo Black and Felix Frankfurter  would become  lifelong adversaries   195  Frankfurter even labeled his more

minority groups  especially African Americans  Catholics  and Jews  and was highly successful in attracting large majorities of these voters into his New Deal coalition  197  He won strong support from Chinese Americans and Filipino Americans  but not Japanese Americans  198  African Americans and Native Americans fared well in two New Deal relief programs  the Indian Reorganization Act and the Civilian Conservation Corps  Sitkoff reported that the WPA  provided an economic floor for the whole black community in the 1930s  rivaling both agriculture and domestic service as the chief source  of income  199  Roosevelt needed the support of Southern Democrats for his New Deal programs  and he therefore decided not to push for anti lynching legislation that could not pass and might threaten his ability to pass his highest priority programs though he did denounce lynchings as  a vile form of collective murder   200  Historian Kevin J  McMahon claims that strides were made for the civil rights of African Americans  In Roosevelt s Justice Department  the Civil Rights Section worked closely with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  NAACP   Roosevelt worked with other civil rights groups on cases dealing with police brutality  lynching  and voting rights abuses  201  Beginning in the 1960s FDR was charged 202  with not acting decisively enough to prevent or stop the Holocaust  Critics cite instances such as the 1939 episode in which 936 Jewish refugees on the SS St  Louis were denied asylum and not allowed into the United States because of strict laws passed by Congress  203  The issue of desegregating the armed forces did not arise  but in 1940 Roosevelt appointed Hastie to be a civilian aide to Secretary of War Henry L  Stimson  204  On the home front on June 25  1941  Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8802  forbidding discrimination on account of  race  creed  color  or national origin  in the hiring of workers in defense related industries  205  This was a precursor to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to come decades later  206  Enemy aliens and people of Japanese ancestry fared badly  On February 19  1942  Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 that applied to everyone classified as an  enemy alien   including people who had dual citizenship living in designated high risk areas that covered most of the cities on the West Coast  207  With the U S at war with Italy  some 600 000 Italian aliens  citizens of Italy who did not have U S  citizenship  were subjected to strict travel restrictions  the restrictions were lifted in October 1942  208  Some 120 000 people of Japanese ancestry were forced to leave the West Coast  From 1942 to 1945  they lived in internment camps inland  Those outside the West Coast  and in Hawaii  were not affected  Legacy The Four Freedoms engraved on a wall at the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in Washington A majority of polls rank Roosevelt as the second or third greatest president  consistent with other surveys  209  Roosevelt is the sixth most admired person from the 20th century by U S  citizens  according to Gallup  210  The rapid expansion of government programs that occurred during Roosevelt s term redefined the role of the government in the United States  and Roosevelt s advocacy of government social programs was instrumental in redefining liberalism for coming generations  211  Roosevelt firmly established the United States  leadership role on the world stage  with his role in shaping and financing World War II  His isolationist critics faded away  and even the Republicans joined in his overall policies  212  After his death  his widow continued to be a forceful presence in U S  and world politics  serving as delegate to the conference which established the United Nations and championing civil rights and liberalism generally  Many members of his administration played leading roles in the administrations of Truman  Kennedy and Johnson  each of whom embraced Roosevelt s political legacy  213  Reflecting on Roosevelt s presidency   which brought the United States through the Great Depression and World War II to a prosperous future   said FDR s biographer Jean Edward Smith in 2007   He lifted himself from a wheelchair to lift the nation from its knees   214  Both during and after his terms  critics of Roosevelt questioned not only his policies and positions  but even more so the consolidation of power in the White House at a time when dictators were taking over Europe and Asia  215  Many of the New Deal programs were abolished during the war by FDR s opponents  The powerful new wartime agencies were set up to be temporary and expire at war s end  216  Roosevelt s home in Hyde Park is now a National Historic Site and home to his Presidential library  His retreat at Warm Springs  Georgia is a museum operated by the state of Georgia  His summer retreat on Campobello Island is maintained by the governments of both Canada and the United States as Roosevelt Campobello International Park  the island is accessible by way of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Bridge  The Roosevelt Memorial is located in Washington  D C  next to the Jefferson Memorial on the Tidal Basin  and Roosevelt s image appears on the Roosevelt dime  Many parks and schools  as well as an aircraft carrier and a Paris subway station and hundreds of streets and squares both across the U S  and the rest of the world have been named in his honor  Roosevelt was a strong supporter of scouting  beginning in 1915  Roosevelt s leadership in the March of Dimes is one reason he is commemorated on the American dime  217  218  Roosevelt was honored by the United States Postal Service with a Prominent Americans series 6  postage stamp  issue of 1966  Roosevelt
