the United States Army s available combat forces and approximately one third of its support organizations were National Guard units  The Air National Guard part of the United States Air Force was established in 1947  Title 10 of the US Code states   a  The militia of the United States consists of all able bodied males at least 17 years of age and  except as provided in section 313 of title 32  under 45 years of age who are  or who have made a declaration of intention to become  citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard   b  The classes of the militia are   1  the organized militia  which consists of the National Guard and the Naval Militia  and  2  the unorganized militia  which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia  11  Many states also maintain their own State Defense Forces  These forces are federally recognized militia but not as an armed force service  Because of this  they are separate from the National Guard and are not meant to be federalized  They serve the state exclusively  especially when the National Guard is deployed or otherwise unavailable  Army National Guard units are trained and equipped as part of the U S  Army  The Army also operated air units until the passage of the 1947 National Defense Act  This created the U S  Air Force  as well as the separate Air National Guard  Air National Guard units are trained and equipped as part of the U S  Air Force  Both are expected to adhere to the same moral and physical standards as their  full time  federal counterparts  The same ranks and insignia are used and National Guardsmen are eligible to receive all United States military awards  The National Guard also bestows a number of state awards for local services rendered in a service member s home state   edit  Constitutional basis National Guardsmen  Penn Station  New York City The United States National Guard is authorized by the Constitution of the United States  As originally drafted  the Constitution recognized the existing state Militias  and gave them vital roles to fill   to execute the Laws of the Union  suppress Insurrections and repel Invasion    Article I  Section 8  Clause 15   The Constitution distinguished  Militia s    which were state entities  from  Troops   which were unlawful for states to maintain under normal circumstances   Article I  Section 10  Clause 3   Though originally state entities  the Constitutional  Militia of the Several States  were not entirely independent  however  because they could be federalized  According to Article I  Section 8  Clause 14  the United States Congress is given the power to pass laws for  calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union  suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions   Congress is also empowered to come up with the guidelines  for organizing  arming  and disciplining  the Militia  and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States  reserving to the States respectively  the Appointment of the Officers  and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress   clause 16   The President of the United States is the commander in chief of the state militias  when called into the actual Service of the United States    Article II  Section 2   The traditional state militias were redefined and recreated as the  organized militia    the National Guard  via the Militia Act of 1903  They were now subject to an increasing amount of federal control  including having arms and accouterments supplied by the central government  federal funding  and numerous closer ties to the Regular Army   edit  Laws covering the National Guard and the National Guard of the United States The United States Congress has enacted various laws which control the National Guard The Militia Act of 1792 Providing for the authority of the President to call out the Militia  and providing federal standards for the organization of the Militia  For the 111 years that the Militia Act of 1792 remained in effect  it defined the position of the militia in relation to the federal government  The War of 1812 tested this uniquely American defense establishment  To fight the War of 1812  the republic formed a small regular military and trained it to protect the frontiers and coastlines  Although it performed poorly in the offensive against Canada  the small force of regulars backed by a well armed militia  accomplished its defensive mission well  Generals like Andrew Jackson proved that  just as they had in the Revolution  regulars and militia could be effective when employed as a team  The Insurrection Act The Militia Act of 1862 Providing for the service of persons of African descent in the Militia  and the emancipation of slaves owned by Confederates  Title 18  U S  Code  Section 1385  The Posse Comitatus Act of 18 June 1878 Reaction in Congress against the Reconstruction era suspensions of Southern states  rights to organize militias led to the passage of the Posse Comitatus Act  restricting any person s use of the U S  Army and  as later amended  the U S  Air Force in domestic law enforcement  use of the Navy and Marine Corps  being uniformed services within the Department of Defense  is similarly restricted by statute   12  The U S  Coast Guard  in its peacetime role within the Department of Homeland Security  and the National Guard  when not in Federal Service  are specifically not limited by this act  The States revise the military codes   1881 to 1892 The Militia Act of 1903 Established the creation of the National Guard of the United States as the primary organized reserve force for the U S  armed forces  National Defense Act of 1916 This act abandoned the idea of an expandable Regular Army and firmly established the traditional concept of the citizens  army as the keystone of the United States defense forces  It established the concept of merging the National Guard  the Army Reserve  and the Regular Army into the Army of the United States in time of war  The act further expanded the National Guard s role  and guaranteed the State militias  status as the Army s primary reserve force  The law mandated use of the term  National Guard  for that force  and the President was given authority  in case of war or national emergency  to mobilize the National Guard for the duration of the emergency  The number of yearly drills increased from 24 to 48 and annual training from five to 15 days  Drill pay was authorized for the first time  The National Defense Act Amendments of 1920 This act established that the chief of the Militia Bureau  later the National Guard Bureau  would be a National Guard officer  that National Guard officers would be assigned to the general staff and that the divisions  as used by the Guard in World War I  would be reorganized  The National Guard Mobilization Act  1933 Made the National Guard a component of the Army  The National Defense Act of 1947 Section 207  f  established the Air National Guard of the United States  under the National Guard Bureau  The Total Force Policy  1973 Requires all active and reserve military organizations be treated as a single force  The Montgomery Amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987 provides that a governor cannot withhold consent with regard to active duty outside the United States because of any objection to the location  purpose  type  or schedule of such duty  This law was challenged and upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1990 in Perpich v  Department of Defense  13   The John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 Pub L  109 364 Federal law was changed in section 1076 so that the Governor of a state is no longer the sole commander in chief of their state s National Guard during emergencies within the state  The President of the United States will now be able to take total control of a state s National Guard units without the governor s consent  14  In a letter to Congress all 50 governors opposed the increase in power of the president over the National Guard  15  The National Defense Authorization Act 2008 Pub L  110 181 Repeals provisions in section 1076 in Pub L  109 364 but still enables the President to call up the National Guard of the United States for active federal military service during Congressionally sanctioned national emergency or war  Places the National Guard Bureau directly under the Department of Defense as a joint activity  Promoted the Chief of the National Guard Bureau from a three star to a four star general   edit  Duties and administrative organization Seal of the National Guard Bureau  NGB  National Guard units can be mobilized for active duty to supplement regular armed forces during times of war or national emergency declared by Congress  16  the President 16  or the Secretary of Defense  17  They can also be activated for service in their respective states upon declaration of a state of emergency by the governor of the state or territory in which they serve  in the case of Washington  D C   the Commanding General  Unlike Army Reserve members  National Guard members cannot be mobilized individually  except through voluntary transfers and Temporary Duty Assignments  TDY   However  there have been a significant number of individual activations to support ongoing military operations related to the Global War on Terrorism  beginning in 2001   the legality of this policy is a major issue within the National Guard  citation needed  The National Guard Bureau is in Arlington  Virginia  and is a joint activity of the Department of Defense to conduct all the administrative matters pertaining to the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard  The current chief of the National Guard Bureau is General Craig R  McKinley  The chief is the senior uniformed National Guard officer  in charge of developing all policies and advising the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  the Secretaries and Chiefs of Staff of the Army and the Air Force on all National Guard issues  He is appointed by the President in his capacity as Commander in Chief   edit  History  edit  Early history First Muster  Spring 1637  Massachusetts Bay Colony  The claim that the National Guard is older than the nation itself  with over three and a half centuries of service  is based on the claim that the modern day 101st Field Artillery Regiment  182nd Infantry Regiment  101st Engineer Battalion and 181st Infantry Regiment of the Massachusetts Army National Guard are directly descended from Massachusetts Bay Colony regiments formed over 375 years ago  On 13 December 1648  1  18  the General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony had ordered that the Colony s scattered militia companies be organized into North  South and East Regiments with a goal of increasing the militias  accountability to the colonial government  efficacy  and responsiveness in conflicts with indigenous Pequot Indians  Under this act  white males between the ages of 16 and 60 were obligated to possess arms and to take part in the defense of their communities by serving in nightly guard details and participating in weekly drills  As the British Colonies developed  colonial militias would develop out of this tradition  The Massachusetts militia began the American Revolutionary War at the Battles of Lexington and Concord  19  and provided the majority of soldiers during the course of the war  The early United States distrusted a standing army  and kept the number of professional soldiers small  During the Northwest Indian War  the majority of soldiers were provided by state militias  There are nineteen Army National Guard units with campaign credit for the War of 1812  The visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the U S   in 1824 25  was in every sense a triumphal procession  The 2nd Battalion  11th New York Artillery  was one of many militia commands who turned out in welcome  This unit decided to adopt the title  National Guard   in honor of Lafayette s celebrated Garde Nationale de Paris  The Battalion  later the 7th Regiment  was prominent in the line of march on the occasion of Lafayette s final passage through New York en route home to France  Taking note of the troops named for his old command  Lafayette alighted from his carriage  walked down the line  clasping each officer by the hand as he passed   National Guard  was destined to become the name of the U S  militia  Militia units provided 70  of the soldiers that fought in the Mexican American War  19  and also provided the majority of soldiers in the early months of the American Civil War 20  The majority of soldiers in the Spanish American War were from the National Guard  19   edit  20th century A National Guardsman in 1917  Throughout the 19th century the regular Army was small  and the militia provided the majority of the troops during the Mexican American War  the start of the American Civil War  and the Spanish American War  With the Militia Act of 1903  part of the militia was federalized and renamed the National Guard and organized as a Reserve force for the Army  this is the official founding of the National Guard  In World War I  the National Guard made up 40 percent of the U S  combat divisions in France  In World War II the National Guard made up 19 divisions  One hundred forty thousand Guardsmen were mobilized during the Korean War and over 63 000 for Operation Desert Storm  They have also participated in U S  peacekeeping operations in Somalia  Haiti  Saudi Arabia  Kuwait  Bosnia  and Kosovo as well as for natural disasters  strikes  riots and security for the Olympic Games when they have been in the States  Following World War II  the National Guard aviation units became the Air National Guard  There is no Naval National Guard due to the constitutional provision against states having ships of war in time of peace  though Alaska  California  New Jersey  New York  South Carolina  Texas and Ohio have incorporated Naval Militia units  and the United States Coast Guard has military prerogatives in time of war  At this time the National Guard consisted of 27 Divisions  25 Infantry and two armored  plus scores of smaller units  On 24 September 1957 President Dwight D  Eisenhower federalized the entire Arkansas National Guard in order to ensure the safe entry of the Little Rock 9 to Little Rock Central High School the following day  Governor Orval Faubus had previously used members of the guard to deny the students entry to the school  The New York National Guard were ordered by Governor Nelson A  Rockefeller to respond to the Rochester 1964 race riot in July of that year  the first such use of the Guard in a Northern city since the Civil War  The California Army National Guard were mobilized by the Governor of California Edmund Gerald Brown  Sr  during the Watts Riots  in August 1965  to provide security and help restore order  Elements of the Ohio Army National Guard were ordered to Kent State University by Ohio s governor Jim Rhodes to quell anti Vietnam War protests  culminating in their shooting into a crowd of students on 4 May 1970  killing four and injuring nine  The 2 Battalion 138th Field Artillery of the Kentucky National Guard was ordered to service in Vietnam in late 1968  The unit served in support of the regular 101st Airborne Division  The Battalion s C Battery lost 9 men killed and thirty two wounded when North Vietnamese troops overran Fire Base Tomahawk on 19 June 1969  21  During the LA Riots in 1992  when portions of south central Los Angeles erupted in chaos  overwhelming the Los Angeles Police Department s ability to contain the violence  the California National Guard were mobilized to help restore order  The National Guard were attributed with five shootings of people suspected of violating the curfew order placed on the city  During the Waco Siege in 1993 the Texas National Guard was called in to assist the Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco  Firearms and Explosives in bringing down the Branch Davidians  the National Guard s involvement was mostly for defensive purposes  The ATF suspected that the Branch Davidians could be armed with powerful weapons  and so the M1A1 Abrams tanks were used to protect the ATF s retreat area  some National Guard helicopters were also used to do reconnaissance work and an unknown number of National Guard snipers assisted the ATF in the final assault  As a result of the Bottom Up Review and post Cold War force cutbacks  the Army National Guard maneuver force was reduced to eight divisions  from ten  the 26th Infantry and 50th Armored were consolidated in the northeastern states  and fifteen  enhanced brigades   which were supposed to be ready for combat operations  augmenting the active force  within 90 days  22   edit  21st century The National Guard Memorial Building in Washington  D C  National Guard units played a major role in providing security and assisting recovery efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina  in September 2005  In January and February 2007  National Guard troops from 8 states were activated to go help shovel snow  drop hay for starving cattle  deliver food and necessities to stranded people in their houses  and help control traffic and rescue stranded motorists in blizzards dropping feet of snow across the country  23  The Air National Guard has more than 106 000 personnel  and the Army National Guard  ARNG  around 325 000 personnel  as of February 2006   citation needed  In 2005  National Guard members and reservists were said to comprise a larger percentage of frontline fighting forces than in any war in U S  history  about 43 percent in Iraq and 55 percent in Afghanistan   24  There were more than 183 366 National Guard members and reservists on active duty nationwide who left behind about 300 000 dependents  according to U S  Defense Department statistics  In 2011  Army Chief of Staff Gen  George W  Casey  Jr  stated that  Every Guard brigade has deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan  and over 300 000 Guardsmen have deployed in this war   25  The Army National Guard is reorganizing into 28 brigade combat teams and 78 support brigades as a part of the Army s transformation plan  When the reorganization is complete  brigades will have 3 000 to 4 000 soldiers whereas the former Army organization was principally structured around large  mostly mechanized  divisions of around 15 000 soldiers each  In the first quarter of 2007  United States Secretary of Defense Robert M  Gates announced changes to the Guard deployment policy aimed at shorter and more predictable deployments for National Guard troops   Gates said his goal is for Guard members to serve a one year deployment no more than every five years    Gates is imposing a one year limit to the length of deployment for National Guard Soldiers  effective immediately   Prior to this time  Guard troops deployed for a standard one year deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan would serve for 18 or more months including training and transit time  During the transition to the new policy for all troops in the pipeline  deployed or soon to be deployed  some will face deployments faster than every five years   The one to five year cycle does not include activations for state emergencies   26   edit  Developments after 11 September 2001 National Guardsman of the 1st Battalion  151st Infantry Regiment in Parun  Afghanistan  Note that he is wearing a 10th Mountain Division Former Wartime Service SSI Prior to the attacks against the United States on 11 September 2001  the National Guard s general policy regarding mobilization was that Guardsmen would be required to serve no more than one year cumulative on active duty  with no more than six months overseas  for each five years of regular drill  Due to strains placed on active duty units following the attacks  the possible mobilization time was increased to 18 months  with no more than one year overseas   Additional strains placed on military units as a result of the invasion of Iraq further increased the amount of time a Guardsman could be mobilized to 24 months  Current Department of Defense policy is that no Guardsman will be involuntarily activated for more than 24 months  cumulative  in one six year enlistment period  citation needed  Traditionally  most National Guard personnel serve  One weekend a month  two weeks a year   although personnel in highly operational or high demand units serve far more frequently  Typical examples are pilots  navigators and aircrewmen in active flying assignments  primarily in the Air National Guard and to a lesser extent in the Army National Guard  A significant number also serve in a full time capacity in roles such as Active Guard and Reserve  AGR  or Air Reserve Technician or Army Reserve Technician  ART   The  One weekend a month  two weeks a year  slogan has lost most of its relevance since the Iraq War  when nearly 28  of total US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan at the end of 2007 consisted of mobilized personnel of the National Guard and other Reserve components  27   edit  Agricultural Development Teams Prior to 2008  the functions of Agricultural Development Teams were within Provincial Reconstruction Teams of the U S  Government  Today  ADTs consist of people from the Army Guard and the Air National Guard  Today  ADTs bring  an effective platform for enhanced dialogue  building confidence  sharing interests  and increasing cooperation amongst the disparate peoples and tribes of Afghanistan   28  These teams are not only affiliated with the U S  National Guard  they frequently work across agencies  for example with USAID and the Department of State  ADTs provide education and expertise on the ground  while also providing security and order that is traditionally affiliated with the military  These teams have been essential to the counterinsurgency efforts in Afghanistan as a public diplomacy tool to build relations with the local people in the tribes and provinces of the country  ADTs provide classroom instruction and teachings to Afghan s about how to improve their farming practices during non seasonal growing months  which allows the farmers to use skills in the winter to prepare for farming in the summer and fall  This enhances agricultural production and the Afghan economy as a whole  Agricultural education also improves lines of communication and builds trust between the people  the U S  government  and the Host Nation  Additionally  through word of mouth in the provinces ideas are spread that inform others about these farming techniques  that may not have had direct interaction with the ADTs  The National Guard ADTs also introduce their U S  civilian colleagues to the Afghan University personnel  which further strengthens relations and trust in the U S  efforts in Afghanistan  29  ADTs also enhance public diplomacy in Afghanistan by providing security to the local provinces they are working within  This tool has provided the teams with the civilian military partnership that is needed to conduct public diplomacy and defeat the insurgents in Afghanistan  President Barack Obama said that the U S  will enhance agricultural development instead of big reconstruction projects to build Afghanistan s economy  to have an immediate impact on the Afghan people  Today  these projects include  basic gardening practices  to large watershed and irrigation projects  There are also projects that teach bee keeping and livestock production  all of which will have a positive impact on unemployment  hunger  and the ability to sustain future generations   28  More and more Afghan tribal leaders have been requesting additional ADTs  which illustrates how important the use of public diplomacy has been in the efforts to win the trust of the Afghan people  The case study from Nangarhar Province in Afghanistan serves as an excellent example  This province is one of the most stable and secure provinces in Afghanistan  For example  over 100 000 Afghans have returned to province  the province has also been declared poppy free in 2007 by the UN  Additionally  most districts within the province have all weather paved roads and it is also one of the most productive agricultural regions in Afghanistan  28  ADT should further its progress within the provinces of Afghanistan in agricultural education  technical support  and logistics  In order to defeat the insurgency in Afghanistan public diplomacy is an essential force  ADTs allow the U S  to educate the population of Afghanistan with the hopes of strengthening Afghan trust in the American mission in Afghanistan   edit  National Guard vs Reserve  edit  Combat Arms The Army National Guard consists of 28 fully capable brigade combat teams with combat support and combat service support components  The Army Reserve is solely Combat Service Support and Combat Support   edit  Jurisdiction The National Guard is
