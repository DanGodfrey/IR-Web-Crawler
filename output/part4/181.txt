pronounced  k m r          m r       is a member of the Brythonic branch of the Celtic languages spoken natively in Wales  by some along the Welsh border in England  and in Y Wladfa  the Welsh colony in Chubut Province  Argentina   6  Historically  it has also been known in English as  Cambrian   7   Cambric  8  and  Cymric   9  The Welsh Language Board 1  indicated in 2004 that 611 000 people  21 7  of the population of Wales in households or communal establishments  were able to speak Welsh  This figure marks a 0 9 percentage point increase when compared with a figure of 20 8  from the 2001 census  and an increase of approximately 35 000 in absolute numbers within Wales  1  Of those 611 000 Welsh speakers  57   315 000  considered themselves fluent  and 78   477 000  consider themselves fluent or  fair  speakers  62  of speakers  340 000  claimed to speak the language daily  including 88  of fluent speakers  1  A greeting in Welsh is one of 55 languages included on the Voyager Golden

emerged in the 6th century from British  the common ancestor of Welsh  Breton  Cornish  and the extinct language known as Cumbric  Like most languages  there are identifiable periods within the history of Welsh  although the boundaries between these are often indistinct  The name Welsh originated as an exonym given to its speakers by the Anglo Saxons  meaning  foreign speech   see Walha   The native term for the language is Cymraeg  and Cymru for  Wales    edit  Distribution of Welsh speakers Bilingual road markings near Cardiff Airport  Vale of Glamorgan Welsh has been spoken continuously in Wales throughout recorded history  but by 1911 it had become a minority language  spoken by 43 5  of the population  13  While this decline continued over the following decades  the language did not die out  and by the start of the twenty first century  numbers had begun to rise  The 2004 Welsh Language Use Survey showed 21 7  of the population of Wales to be Welsh speakers  1  an increase from 20 5  in the 2001 census  and from 18 5  in 1991  The 2001 census also showed that about 25  of Welsh residents were born outside Wales  The number of Welsh speakers in the rest of Britain has not yet been compiled for statistical purposes  In 1993  S4C  the Welsh language television channel  published the results of a survey into the numbers of people who spoke or understood Welsh  which estimated that there were around 133 000 Welsh speakers living in England  about 50 000 of them in the Greater London area  14  Historically  large numbers of Welsh people spoke only Welsh  15  but monoglot Welsh speakers are now virtually non existent  except among mother tongue speakers below school age as well as small numbers of elderly people in traditional Welsh speaking regions  citation needed  Almost without exception  Welsh speakers in Wales also speak English  while in Chubut Province  Argentina  almost all speakers can speak Spanish   see Y Wladfa   However  many first language Welsh speakers are more comfortable expressing themselves in Welsh than in English  A speaker s choice of language can vary according to the subject domain and the social context  even within a single discourse  known in linguistics as code switching   Welsh as a first language is largely concentrated in the north and west of Wales  principally Gwynedd  Conwy  Denbighshire  Sir Ddinbych   Anglesey  Ynys M n   Carmarthenshire  Sir G r   north Pembrokeshire  Sir Benfro   Ceredigion  parts of Glamorgan  Morgannwg   and north west and extreme south west Powys  although first language and other fluent speakers can be found throughout Wales   edit  Official status Although Welsh is a minority language  support for the language grew during the second half of the 20th century  along with the rise of organisations such as the nationalist political party Plaid Cymru from 1925 and Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg  the Welsh Language Society  from 1962  The Welsh Language Act 1993 and the Government of Wales Act 1998 provide that the Welsh and English languages be treated equally in the public sector  as far as is reasonable and practicable  Public bodies are required to prepare for approval a Welsh Language Scheme  which indicates their commitment to the equality of treatment principle  This is sent out in draft form for public consultation for a three month period  whereupon comments on it may be incorporated into a final version  It requires the final approval of the Welsh Language Board  Bwrdd yr Iaith Gymraeg   Thereafter  the public body is charged with implementing and fulfilling its obligations under the Welsh Language Scheme  The list of other public bodies which have to prepare Schemes could be added to by initially the Secretary of State for Wales  from 1993 1997  by way of Statutory Instrument  Subsequent to the forming of the National Assembly for Wales in 1997  the Government Minister responsible for the Welsh language can and has passed Statutory Instruments naming public bodies who have to prepare Schemes  Neither 1993 Act nor secondary legislation made under it cover the private sector  although some organisations  notably banks and some railway companies  provide some of their literature through the medium of Welsh  citation needed  On 7 December 2010  the Welsh Assembly unanimously approved a set of measures to develop the use of the Welsh language within Wales  16  17  On 9 February 2011  this measure received Royal Approval and was passed  thus making the Welsh language an officially recognised language within Wales  18  The Measure  confirms the official status of the Welsh language  creates a new system of placing duties on bodies to provide services through the medium of Welsh  creates a Welsh Language Commissioner with strong enforcement powers to protect the rights of Welsh speakers to access services through the medium of Welsh  establishes a Welsh Language Tribunal  gives individuals and bodies the right to appeal decisions made in relation to the provision of services through the medium of Welsh creates a Welsh Language Partnership Council to advise Government on its strategy in relation to the Welsh language  allows for an official investigation by the Welsh Language Commissioner of instances where there is an attempt to interfere with the freedom of Welsh speakers to use the language with one another  19  With the passing of this measure  public bodies and some private companies will be required to provide services in it  though it remains to be seen which companies will have to comply  The Minister for Heritage  Alun Ffred Jones  said   The Welsh language is a source of great pride for the people of Wales  whether they speak it or not  and I am delighted that this Measure has now become law  I am very proud to have steered legislation through the Assembly which confirms the official status of the Welsh language  which creates a strong advocate for Welsh speakers and will improve the quality and quantity of services available through the medium of Welsh  I believe that everyone who wants to access services in the Welsh language should be able to do so  and that is what this government has worked towards  This legislation is an important and historic step forward for the language  its speakers and for the nation   19  The measure was not welcomed warmly by all supporters  Bethan Williams  chairperson of language campaign group Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg  gave a mixed response to the move  saying   Through this measure we have won official status for the language and that has been warmly welcomed  But there was a core principle missing in the law passed by the Assembly before Christmas  It doesn t give language rights to the people of Wales in every aspect of their lives  Despite that  an amendment to that effect was supported by 18 Assembly Members from three different parties  and that was a significant step forward   20  On 5 October 2011  Meri Huws  Chairwoman of Bwrdd yr Iaith Gymraeg was appointed the new Welsh Language Commissioner  21  In a statement released by her  she said that she was  delighted  to have been appointed to the  hugely important role   adding   I look forward to working with the Welsh Government and organisations in Wales in developing the new system of standards  I will look to build on the good work that has been done by the Welsh Language Board and others to strengthen the Welsh language and ensure that it continues to thrive   First Minister Carwyn Jones said that Meri will act as a champion for the Welsh language  though some had concerns over her appointment  Plaid Cymru spokeswoman Bethan Jenkins said   I have concerns about the transition from Meri Huws s role from the Welsh Language Board to the language commissioner  and I will be asking the Welsh government how this will be successfully managed  We must be sure that there is no conflict of interest  and that the Welsh Language Commissioner can demonstrate how she will offer the required fresh approach to this new role   Local councils and the National Assembly for Wales use Welsh as a quasi official language  issuing their literature and publicity in Welsh versions  e g  letters to parents from schools  library information  and council information  and most road signs in Wales are in English and Welsh  including the Welsh placenames  However  some references to destinations in England are still given in English only  even where there are long established Welsh names  e g  London  Llundain  The  English  Midlands  Canolbarth Lloegr   Since 2000  the teaching of Welsh has been compulsory in all schools in Wales up to age 16  and that has had a major effect in stabilising and to some extent reversing the decline in the language  It means  for example  that even the children of non Welsh speaking parents from elsewhere in the UK grow up with a knowledge of or complete fluency in the language  citation needed  Although most road signs throughout Wales are bilingual  the wording on currency is in English only  The one exception is the legend on Welsh pound coins dated 1985  1990 and 1995  which are legal tender in all parts of the UK   Pleidiol wyf i m gwlad  which means  True am I to my country   and derives from the national anthem of Wales  Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau  The new British coinage from 2008 will not bear any Welsh language at all  despite being designed by a resident of North Wales and being minted at the Royal Mint in Llantrisant  South Wales  Although many shops employ bilingual signage  Welsh still rarely appears on product packaging or instructions  citation needed  The UK government has ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in respect of Welsh  22  Bilingual road sign near Wrexham Central station in 2009 The language has greatly increased its prominence since the creation of the television channel S4C in November 1982  which until digital switchover in 2010 broadcast 70  of Channel 4 s programming along with a majority of Welsh language shows 23  during peak viewing hours  The all Welsh language digital station S4C Digidol is available throughout Europe on satellite and online throughout the UK  Since the digital switchover was completed in South Wales on 31 March 2010  S4C Digidol became the main broadcasting channel and fully in Welsh  The main evening television news provided by the BBC in Welsh is available for download  24  There is also a Welsh language radio station  BBC Radio Cymru  which was launched in 1977  There is  however  no daily newspaper in Welsh  the only Welsh language national newspaper Y Cymro   The Welshman   being published once a week  A daily newspaper called Y Byd   The World   was scheduled to be launched on 3 March 2008 but has been scrapped  25  owing to poor sales of subscriptions citation needed  and the Welsh Government deeming the publication as not meeting the criteria necessary for the kind of public funding it needed to be rescued  citation needed  Since December 2001 the British Government has planned to ensure that all immigrants speak English  It remains to be seen if Welsh will be considered a separate case  At present  knowledge of Welsh  English or Scottish Gaelic is sufficient for naturalisation purposes and it is believed that this policy will be continued in any proposed changes to the law  citation needed   edit  Vocabulary Welsh vocabulary draws mainly from original Brythonic words  wy  egg   carreg  stone    with some loans from Latin  ffenestr  window   lt  Latin fenestra  gwin  wine   lt  Latin vinum   and English  silff  shelf   giat  gate     edit  Orthography Main article  Welsh orthography Welsh is written in a Latin alphabet traditionally consisting of 28 letters  of which eight are digraphs treated as single letters for collation  a  b  c  ch  d  dd  e  f  ff  g  ng  h  i  l  ll  m  n  o  p  ph  r  rh  s  t  th  u  w  y In contrast to English practice   w  and  y  are considered vowel letters in Welsh along with  a    e    i    o  and  u   The letter  j  is used in many everyday words borrowed from English  like jam  j c  joke  and garej  garage   The letters  k    q    v    x   and  z  are used in some technical terms  like kilogram  volt and zero  but in all cases can be  and often are  replaced by Welsh letters  cilogram  folt and sero  26  The letter  k  was in common use until the sixteenth century  but was dropped at the time of the publication of the New Testament in Welsh  as William Salesbury explained   C for K  because the printers have not so many as the Welsh requireth   This change was not popular at the time  27  The most common diacritic is the circumflex  which disambiguates long vowels  most often in the case of homographs  where the vowel is short in one word and long in the other  e g  man  place  vs m n  fine    small    edit  Grammar  edit  Phonology Main article  Welsh phonology The phonology of Welsh is characterised by a number of sounds that do not occur in English and are typologically rare in European languages  specifically voiceless sonorants such as the voiceless lateral fricative      voiceless nasal stops  m     n    and       and voiceless rhotic  r    Stress usually falls on the penultimate syllable in polysyllabic words  while the word final unstressed syllable receives a higher pitch than the stressed syllable   edit  Morphology Main articles  Colloquial Welsh morphology and Literary Welsh morphology Welsh morphology has much in common with that of the other modern Insular Celtic languages  such as the use of initial consonant mutations  and the use of so called  conjugated prepositions   prepositions that fuse with the personal pronouns that are their object   Welsh nouns belong to one of two grammatical genders  masculine and feminine  but are not inflected for case  Welsh has a variety of different endings to indicate the plural  and two endings to indicate the singular of some nouns  In spoken Welsh  verb inflection is indicated primarily by the use of auxiliary verbs  rather than by the inflection of the main verb  In literary Welsh  on the other hand  inflection of the main verb is usual   edit  Syntax Main article  Welsh syntax The canonical word order in Welsh is verb subject object  Colloquial Welsh inclines very strongly towards the use of auxiliaries with its verbs  The present tense is constructed with bod   to be   as an auxiliary verb  with the main verb appearing as a verbnoun  loosely equivalent to an infinitive  after the particle yn  Mae Si n yn mynd i Lanelli Si n is going to Llanelli  Here mae is the third person present form of bod  and mynd is the verb meaning  go   The imperfect is constructed in a similar manner  as are the periphrastic forms of the future and conditional tenses  In the preterite  future  and conditional tenses  there are inflected forms of all verbs  which are invariably used in the written language   However  it is more common nowadays in speech to use the verbnoun together with the inflected form of gwneud   to do    so  I went  can be Mi es i or Mi wnes i fynd  Mi is an example of a preverbal particle  such particles are common in Welsh  Welsh lacks pronouns for constructing subordinate clauses  instead  preverbal particles and special verb forms are used   edit  Other features of Welsh grammar  edit  Possessives as direct objects of verbal nouns The Welsh for  I like Rhodri  is Dw i n hoffi Rhodri   I am in liking  of  Rhodri    where Rhodri is in a possessive relationship to hoffi  With personal pronouns  the possessive form of the personal pronoun is used  as in  I like him    Dw i n ei hoffi   literally   I am in his liking     I like you  is Dw i n dy hoffi   I am your liking     edit  Pronoun doubling In colloquial Welsh  possessive pronouns   whether used to mean  my    your   etc   or to indicate the direct object of a verbal noun   are commonly reinforced by the use of the corresponding personal pronoun after the noun or verbal noun  ei d  e  his house   literally  his house of him    Dw i n dy hoffi di  I like you    I am  engaged in the action of  your liking of you    etc  It should be noted that this  reinforcement   or  simply   redoubling   adds no emphasis in the colloquial register  While the possessive pronoun alone may be used  as is especially common in more formal registers  as shown above   it is considered incorrect to use only the personal pronoun  such usage is nevertheless sometimes heard in very colloquial speech  mainly among young speakers  Ble  dyn ni n mynd  T  ti neu d  fi    Where are we going  Your house or my house      edit  Counting system Main article  Welsh numerals The traditional counting system used by the Welsh language is vigesimal  which is to say it is based on twenties  as in standard French numbers 70  soixante dix  literally  sixty ten   to 99  quatre vingt dix neuf  literally  four twenties nineteen    Welsh numbers from 11 to 14 are  x on ten   16 to 19 are  x on fifteen   though 18 is deunaw  two nines    numbers from 21 to 39 are  1 19 on twenty   40 is  two twenties   60 is  three twenties   etc  This form continues to be used  especially by older people  and it is obligatory in certain circumstances  such as telling the time   28  There is also a decimal counting system  which has become relatively widely used  though less so in giving the time  ages  and dates  it features no ordinal numbers   This system is in especially common use in schools due to its simplicity  and in Patagonian Welsh  Whereas 39 in the vigesimal system would be pedwar ar bymtheg ar hugain   four on fifteen on twenty    in the decimal system it would be tri deg naw   three tens nine    While there is only one word for  one   un   it triggers the soft mutation  treiglad meddal  of feminine nouns  other than those beginning with  ll  and  rh   There are separate masculine and feminine forms of the numbers  two   dau and dwy    three   tri and tair  and  four   pedwar and pedair   which must agree with the grammatical gender of the objects being counted   edit  Dialects Dialectal differences are very pronounced in the spoken and  to a lesser extent  the written language  A convenient  if slightly simplistic  classification is into North Walian and South Walian forms  or Gog and Hwntw based on the word for North  gogledd  and the word Hwynthwy which means  They Themselves  or  Them    The differences between dialects encompass vocabulary  pronunciation and grammar  although particularly in the last regard they are in fact fairly minor  An example of the difference between North and South Walian usage would be the question  Do you want a cup  of tea    In the north this would typically be Dach chi isio panad  while in the south the question Ych chi n moyn dishgled  would be more likely  though in the South one would not be surprised to hear Ych chi isie paned  among other possibilities   An example of a pronunciation difference between Northern and Southern Welsh is the tendency in southern dialects to palatalise the letter  s   e g  mis  month   would tend to be pronounced  mi s  in the north  and  mi    in the south  This normally occurs next to a high front vowel like  i   although exceptions include the pronunciation of sut  how  as    d  in the south  compared with northern  s t    Much more fine grained classifications exist beyond north and south  the book Cymraeg  Cymr g  Cymr g  cyflwyno r tafodieithoedd  29  about Welsh dialects was accompanied by a cassette containing recordings of fourteen different speakers demonstrating aspects of different dialects  The book refers to the earlier Linguistic Geography of Wales 30  as describing six different regions which could be identified as having words specific to those regions  An alternative traditional classification was of four dialects   Y Wyndodeg  the language of Gwynedd  Y Bowyseg  the language of Powys  Y Ddyfedeg  the language of Dyfed  and Y Wenhwyseg  the language of Gwent and Morgannwg  31  Another dialect is Patagonian Welsh  which has developed since the start of the Welsh settlement in Argentina in 1865  it includes Spanish loanwords and terms for local features  but a survey in the 1970s showed that the language in Patagonia is consistent throughout the lower Chubut valley and in the Andes   edit  Registers Modern Welsh can be considered to fall broadly into two main styles Colloquial Welsh  Cymraeg llafar  and Literary Welsh  Cymraeg llenyddol   The grammar described on this page is that of Colloquial Welsh  which is used in most speech and informal writing  Literary Welsh is closer to the form of Welsh standardised by the 1588 translation of the Bible and is found in official documents and other formal registers  including much literature  As a standardised form  literary Welsh shows little if any of the dialectal variation found in colloquial Welsh  Some differences include  Literary Welsh Colloquial Welsh Can omit subject pronouns  pro drop  Subject pronouns rarely omitted More extensive use of simple verb forms More extensive use of periphrastic verb forms No distinction between simple present and future  e g  af  I go   I shall go   Simple form most often expresses only future  e g  af i  I ll go   Subjunctive verb forms Subjunctive in fixed idioms only 3rd pl ending and pronoun  nt hwy 3rd pl ending and pronoun  n nhw Amongst the characteristics of the literary  as against the spoken  language are a higher dependence on inflected verb forms  different usage of some of the tenses  less frequent use of pronouns  since the information is usually conveyed in the verb preposition inflections  and a much lesser tendency to substitute English loanwords for native Welsh words  In addition  more archaic pronouns and forms of mutation may be observed in Literary Welsh   edit  Examples of sentences in literary and colloquial Welsh English Literary Welsh Colloquial Welsh I get up early every day  Codaf yn gynnar bob dydd  Dwi n codi n gynnar bob dydd   North Rwy n codi n gynnar bob dydd   South  I ll get up early tomorrow  Codaf yn gynnar yfory  Coda i n gynnar fory Na i godi n gynnar fory He had not stood there long  Ni safasai yno yn hir  32  Doedd o ddim wedi sefyll yno n hir   North  D odd e ddim wedi sefyll yno n hir   South  They ll sleep only when there s a need  Ni chysgant ond pan fo angen  Fyddan nhw ddim ond yn cysgu pan fydd angen  In fact  the differences between dialects of modern spoken Welsh pale into insignificance compared to the difference between some forms of the spoken language and the most formal constructions of the literary  The latter is considerably more conservative and is the language used in Welsh translations of the Bible  amongst other things  although the Beibl Cymraeg Newydd   New Welsh Bible   is significantly less formal than the traditional 1588 Bible   Gareth King  author of a popular Welsh grammar  observes that  The difference between these two is much greater than between the virtually identical colloquial and literary forms of English   33  A grammar of Literary Welsh can be found in A Grammar of Welsh  1980  by Stephen J  Williams  or more completely in Gramadeg y Gymraeg  1998  by Peter Wynn Thomas  no comprehensive grammar of Welsh exists in English   Most Welsh writing  especially that found on the Internet or in magazines  is closer to colloquial usage  though it is often argued by whom   that this preference results in questionable orthographical and grammatical choices  This is also becoming more common in artistic literature  where the parallel with the well known works of Irvine Welsh or Niall Griffiths may be helpful to understand the effect  and the controversy  Ultimately  the labels Colloquial and Literary may be no more  or less  than convenient approximations  the spoken  i e  colloquial  language naturally permits the use of formal as well as informal registers  and written  i e  literary  conventions are likewise flexible in use of registers   edit  Welsh in education Sign promoting the learning of Welsh Main article  Welsh medium education The decade around 1840 was a period of great social upheaval in Wales  manifested in the Chartist movement  which culminated in 20 000 people marching on Newport in 1839 resulting in a riot when 20 people were killed by soldiers defending the Westgate Hotel  and the Rebecca Riots when tollbooths on turnpikes were systematically destroyed  This unrest brought the state of education in Wales to the attention of the English establishment  as social reformers of the time considered education as a means of dealing with social ills  The Times newspaper was prominent among those who considered that the lack of education of the Welsh people was the root cause of most of the problems  In July 1846  three commissioners  R  R  W  Lingen  Jellynger C  Symons and H  R  Vaughan Johnson  were appointed to inquire into the state of education in Wales  the Commissioners were all Anglicans  and presumed by whom   to be unsympathetic to the non conformist majority in Wales  The Commissioners presented their report to the Government on 1 July 1847 in three large blue bound volumes  This report quickly became known as Brad y Llyfrau Gleision  The Treachery of the Blue Books  34  as  apart from documenting the state of education in Wales  the Commissioners were also free with their comments disparaging the language  non conformity  and the morals of the Welsh people in general  An immediate effect of the report was for a belief to take root in the minds of ordinary people that the only way for Welsh people to get on in the world was through the medium of English  and an inferiority complex developed about the Welsh language whose effects have not yet been completely eradicated  The historian Professor Kenneth O  Morgan referred to the significance of the report and its consequences as  the Glencoe and the Amritsar of Welsh history   35  In the later 19th century virtually all teaching in the schools of Wales was in English  even in areas where the pupils barely understood English  Some schools used the Welsh Not  a piece of wood  often bearing the letters  WN   which was hung around the neck of any pupil caught speaking Welsh  The pupil could pass it on to any schoolmate heard speaking Welsh  with the pupil wearing it at the end of the day being given a beating  Many tried in vain to get rid of this bigotry  One of the most famous Welsh born pioneers of higher education in Wales was Sir Hugh Owen  He made great progress in the cause of education  and more especially the University College of Wales at Aberystwyth  of which he was chief founder  He has been credited by whom   with the Welsh Intermediate Education Act 1889  following which several new Welsh Schools were built  The first was completed in 1894 and named Ysgol Syr Hugh Owen  Towards the beginning of the 20th century this policy slowly began to change  partly owing to the efforts of Owen Morgan Edwards when he became chief inspector of schools for Wales in 1907  The Aberystwyth Welsh School  Ysgol Gymraeg Aberystwyth  was founded in 1939 by Sir Ifan ap Owen Edwards  the son of O  M  Edwards  as the first Welsh Primary School  The headteacher was Norah Isaac  Ysgol Gymraeg is still a very successful school and now there are Welsh language primary schools all over the country  Ysgol Glan Clwyd was established in Rhyl in 1955 as the first Welsh language school to teach at the secondary level  Welsh is now widely used in education  with 20  of all pupils in Wales being taught at Welsh medium schools  36  Under the National Curriculum  it is compulsory that all students should study Welsh up to the age of 16  either as a first language or a second language  37  Many students choose to continue with their studies through the medium of Welsh for the completion of their A levels as well as during their college years  All Local Education Authorities in Wales have schools providing bilingual or Welsh medium education  38  The remainder study Welsh as a second language in English medium schools  Specialist teachers of Welsh called Athrawon Bro support the teaching of Welsh in the National Curriculum  Welsh is also taught in adult education classes  The Welsh Government has recently set up six centres of excellence in the teaching of Welsh for Adults  with centres in North Wales  learncymraeg org   Mid Wales  South West  Glamorgan  Gwent and Cardiff  The ability to speak Welsh or to have Welsh as a qualification is essential or desirable for certain career choices in Wales  such as teaching or customer service  39  All universities in Wales teach some courses in Welsh  most notably Bangor University and Aberystwyth University   but the majority of courses are taught through the medium of the English language   edit  Welsh in information technology Further information  List of Celtic language media As with many of the world s languages  the Welsh language has seen an increased use and presence on the internet  ranging from formal lists of terminology in a variety of fields 40  to Welsh language interfaces for Windows 7  Microsoft Windows XP  Vista  Microsoft Office  OpenOffice org  Mozilla Firefox and a variety of Linux distributions  and on line services to blogs kept in Welsh  41  A variety of websites are also available in Welsh  the social networking site Facebook has offered a Welsh version since 2009  and Wikipedia since July 2003  42   edit  Mobile phone technology In 2006 the Welsh Language Board launched a free software pack which enabled the use of SMS predictive text in Welsh  43  At the National Eisteddfod of Wales 2009  a further announcement was made by the Welsh Language Board that the mobile phone company Samsung was to work with the network provider Orange to provide the first mobile phone in the Welsh language  44  with the interface and the T9 dictionary on the Samsung S5600 available in the Welsh language  The model  available with the Welsh language interface  has been available since 1 September 2009  with plans to introduce it on other networks  45   edit  Welsh in warfare Secure communications are often difficult to achieve in wartime  Cryptography can be used to protect messages  but codes can be broken  Therefore  little known languages are sometimes encoded  so that even if the code is broken  the message is still in a language few people know  For example  Navajo code talkers were used by the United States military during World War
