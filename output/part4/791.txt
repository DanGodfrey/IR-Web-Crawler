Asian cinema European cinema Latin American cinema North American cinema Oceanian cinema A film  also called a movie or motion picture  is a series of still or moving images  It is produced by recording photographic images with cameras  or by creating images using animation techniques or visual effects  The process of filmmaking has developed into an art form and industry  Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures  which reflect those cultures  and  in turn  affect them  Film is considered to be an important art form  a source of popular entertainment and a powerful method for educating   or indoctrinating   citizens  The visual elements of cinema give motion pictures a universal power of communication  Some films have become popular worldwide attractions by using dubbing or subtitles that translate the dialogue into the language of the viewer  Films are made up of a series of individual images called frames  When these images are shown rapidly in succession  a viewer has the illusion that motion is occurring  The viewer cannot see the flickering between frames due to an effect known as persistence of vision  whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after the source has been removed  Viewers perceive motion due to a psychological effect called beta movement  The origin of the name  film  comes from the fact that photographic film  also called film stock  has historically been the primary medium for recording and displaying motion pictures  Many other terms exist for an individual motion picture  including picture  picture show  moving picture  photo play and flick  A common name for film in the United States is movie  while in Europe the term film is preferred  Additional terms for the field in general include the big screen  the silver screen  the cinema and the movies  Contents 1 History 2 Theory 2 1 Language 2 2 Montage 2 3 Criticism 3 Industry 4 Associated fields 5 Terminology used 5

thousands of years  early plays and dances had elements common to film  scripts  sets  costumes  production  direction  actors  audiences  storyboards  and scores  Much terminology later used in film theory and criticism apply  such as mise en scene  roughly  the entire visual picture at any one time   Owing to an absence of technology for doing so  moving visual and aural images were not recorded for replaying as in film  In the 1860s  mechanisms for producing two dimensional drawings in motion were demonstrated with devices such as the zoetrope  mutoscope and praxinoscope  These machines were outgrowths of simple optical devices  such as magic lanterns  and would display sequences of still pictures at sufficient speed for the images on the pictures to appear to be moving  a phenomenon called persistence of vision  Naturally the images needed to be carefully designed to achieve the desired effect  and the underlying principle became the basis for the development of film animation  With the development of celluloid film for still photography  it became possible to directly capture objects in motion in real time  An 1878 experiment by English photographer Eadweard Muybridge in the United States using 24 cameras produced a series of stereoscopic images of a galloping horse  is arguably the first  motion picture   though it was not called by this name  1  This technology required a person to look into a viewing machine to see the pictures which were separate paper prints attached to a drum turned by a handcrank  The pictures were shown at a variable speed of about 5 to 10 pictures per second  depending on how rapidly the crank was turned  Commercial versions of these machines were coin operated  A frame from Roundhay Garden Scene  the world s earliest film produced using a motion picture camera  by Louis Le Prince  1888 By the 1880s the development of the motion picture camera allowed the individual component images to be captured and stored on a single reel  and led quickly to the development of a motion picture projector to shine light through the processed and printed film and magnify these  moving picture shows  onto a screen for an entire audience  These reels  so exhibited  came to be known as  motion pictures   Early motion pictures were static shots that showed an event or action with no editing or other cinematic techniques  The first public exhibition of projected motion pictures in America was shown at Koster and Bial s Music Hall in New York City on the 23rd of April 1896  Ignoring W  K  L  Dickson s early sound experiments  1894   commercial motion pictures were purely visual art through the late 19th century  but these innovative silent films had gained a hold on the public imagination  Around the turn of the 20th century  films began developing a narrative structure by stringing scenes together to tell a story  The scenes were later broken up into multiple shots of varying sizes and angles  Other techniques such as camera movement were realized as effective ways to portray a story on film  Rather than leave the audience with noise of early cinema projectors  theater owners would hire a pianist or organist or a full orchestra to play music that would cover noises of projector  Eventually  musicians would start to fit the mood of the film at any given moment  By the early 1920s  most films came with a prepared list of sheet music for this purpose  with complete film scores being composed for major productions  A shot from Georges M li s Le Voyage dans la Lune  A Trip to the Moon   1902   an early narrative film  The rise of European cinema was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I when the film industry in United States flourished with the rise of Hollywood  typified most prominently by the great innovative work of D  W  Griffith in The Birth of a Nation  1914  and Intolerance  1916   However in the 1920s  European filmmakers such as Sergei Eisenstein  F  W  Murnau  and Fritz Lang  in many ways inspired by the meteoric war time progress of film through Griffith  along with the contributions of Charles Chaplin  Buster Keaton and others  quickly caught up with American film making and continued to further advance the medium  In the 1920s  new technology allowed filmmakers to attach to each film a soundtrack of speech  music and sound effects synchronized with the action on the screen  These sound films were initially distinguished by calling them  talking pictures   or talkies  The next major step in the development of cinema was the introduction of so called  natural color   which meant color that was photographically recorded from nature rather than being added to black and white prints by hand coloring  stencil coloring or other arbitrary procedures  although the earliest processes typically yielded colors which were far from  natural  in appearance  While the addition of sound quickly eclipsed silent film and theater musicians  color replaced black and white much more gradually  The pivotal innovation was the introduction of the three strip version of the Technicolor process  which was first used for short subjects and for isolated sequences in a few feature films released in 1934  then for an entire feature film  Becky Sharp  in 1935  The expense of the process was daunting  but continued favorable public response and enhanced box office receipts increasingly justified the added cost  The number of films made in color slowly increased year after year  In the early 1950s  as the proliferation of black and white television started seriously depressing theater attendance in the US  the use of color was seen as one way of winning back audiences  It soon became the rule rather than the exception  Some important mainstream Hollywood films were still being made in black and white as late as the mid 1960s  but they marked the end of an era  Color television receivers had been available in the US since the mid 1950s  but at first they were very expensive and few broadcasts were in color  During the 1960s  prices gradually came down  color broadcasts became common  and the sale of color television sets boomed  The strong preference of the general public for color was obvious  After the final flurry of black and white film releases in mid decade  all major Hollywood studio film production was exclusively in color  with rare exceptions reluctantly made only at the insistence of  star  directors such as Peter Bogdanovich and Martin Scorsese  Since the decline of the studio system in the 1960s  the succeeding decades saw changes in the production and style of film  Various New Wave movements  including the French New Wave  Indian New Wave  Japanese New Wave and New Hollywood  and the rise of film school educated independent filmmakers were all part of the changes the medium experienced in the latter half of the 20th century  Digital technology has been the driving force in change throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s  3D technology increased in usage and has become more popular since the early 2010s  Theory Main articles  Film theory and Philosophy of language film analysis Film theory seeks to develop concise and systematic concepts that apply to the study of film as art  It was started by Ricciotto Canudo s The Birth of the Sixth Art  Formalist film theory  led by Rudolf Arnheim  B la Bal zs  and Siegfried Kracauer  emphasized how film differed from reality  and thus could be considered a valid fine art  Andr  Bazin reacted against this theory by arguing that film s artistic essence lay in its ability to mechanically reproduce reality not in its differences from reality  and this gave rise to realist theory  More recent analysis spurred by Jacques Lacan s psychoanalysis and Ferdinand de Saussure s semiotics among other things has given rise to psychoanalytical film theory  structuralist film theory  feminist film theory and others  On the other hand  critics from the analytical philosophy tradition  influenced by Wittgenstein  try to clarify misconceptions used in theoretical studies and produce analysis of a film s vocabulary and its link to a form of life  Language Film is considered to have its own language  James Monaco wrote a classic text on film theory titled  How to Read a Film   Director Ingmar Bergman famously said    Andrei  Tarkovsky for me is the greatest  director   the one who invented a new language  true to the nature of film  as it captures life as a reflection  life as a dream   Examples of the language are a sequence of back and forth images of one actor s left profile speaking  followed by another actor s right profile speaking  then a repetition of this  which is a language understood by the audience to indicate a conversation  Another example is zooming in on the forehead of an actor with an expression of silent reflection  then changing to a scene of a younger actor who vaguely resembles the first actor  indicating the first actor is having a memory of their own past  Montage Main article  Montage Parallels to musical counterpoint have been developed into a theory of montage  extended from the complex superimposition of images in early silent film citation needed  to even more complex incorporation of musical counterpoint together with visual counterpoint through mise en scene and editing  as in a ballet or opera  e g   as illustrated in the gang fight scene of director Francis Ford Coppola s film  Rumble Fish  Criticism Main article  Film criticism Film criticism is the analysis and evaluation of films  In general  these works can be divided into two categories  academic criticism by film scholars and journalistic film criticism that appears regularly in newspapers and other media  Film critics working for newspapers  magazines  and broadcast media mainly review new releases  Normally they only see any given film once and have only a day or two to formulate opinions  Despite this  critics have an important impact on films  especially those of certain genres  Mass marketed action  horror  and comedy films tend not to be greatly affected by a critic s overall judgment of a film  The plot summary and description of a film that makes up the majority of any film review can still have an important impact on whether people decide to see a film  For prestige films such as most dramas  the influence of reviews is extremely important  Poor reviews will often doom a film to obscurity and financial loss  The impact of a reviewer on a given film s box office performance is a matter of debate  Some claim that movie marketing is now so intense and well financed that reviewers cannot make an impact against it  However  the cataclysmic failure of some heavily promoted movies which were harshly reviewed  as well as the unexpected success of critically praised independent movies indicates that extreme critical reactions can have considerable influence  Others note that positive film reviews have been shown to spark interest in little known films  Conversely  there have been several films in which film companies have so little confidence that they refuse to give reviewers an advanced viewing to avoid widespread panning of the film  However  this usually backfires as reviewers are wise to the tactic and warn the public that the film may not be worth seeing and the films often do poorly as a result  It is argued that journalist film critics should only be known as film reviewers  and true film critics are those who take a more academic approach to films  This line of work is more often known as film theory or film studies  These film critics attempt to come to understand how film and filming techniques work  and what effect they have on people  Rather than having their works published in newspapers or appear on television  their articles are published in scholarly journals  or sometimes in up market magazines  They also tend to be affiliated with colleges or universities  Industry Main article  Film industry Cate Blanchett at the Berlin International Film Festival  Around 20 000 professionals from over 130 countries attend the event in Berlin  The making and showing of motion pictures became a source of profit almost as soon as the process was invented  Upon seeing how successful their new invention  and its product  was in their native France  the Lumi res quickly set about touring the Continent to exhibit the first films privately to royalty and publicly to the masses  In each country  they would normally add new  local scenes to their catalogue and  quickly enough  found local entrepreneurs in the various countries of Europe to buy their equipment and photograph  export  import and screen additional product commercially  The Oberammergau Passion Play of 1898 citation needed  was the first commercial motion picture ever produced  Other pictures soon followed  and motion pictures became a separate industry that overshadowed the vaudeville world  Dedicated theaters and companies formed specifically to produce and distribute films  while motion picture actors became major celebrities and commanded huge fees for their performances  By 1917 Charlie Chaplin had a contract that called for an annual salary of one million dollars  From 1931 to 1956  film was also the only image storage and playback system for television programming until the introduction of videotape recorders  In the United States today  much of the film industry is centered around Hollywood  Other regional centers exist in many parts of the world  such as Mumbai centered Bollywood  the Indian film industry s Hindi cinema which produces the largest number of films in the world  2  Whether the ten thousand plus feature length films a year produced by the Valley pornographic film industry should qualify for this title is the source of some debate  citation needed  Though the expense involved in making movies has led cinema production to concentrate under the auspices of movie studios  recent advances in affordable film making equipment have allowed independent film productions to flourish  Profit is a key force in the industry  due to the costly and risky nature of filmmaking  many films have large cost overruns  a notorious example being Kevin Costner s Waterworld  Yet many filmmakers strive to create works of lasting social significance  The Academy Awards  also known as  the Oscars   are the most prominent film awards in the United States  providing recognition each year to films  ostensibly based on their artistic merits  There is also a large industry for educational and instructional films made in lieu of or in addition to lectures and texts  Associated fields Further information  Film history   Film criticism  Film theory  Product placement  and Propaganda Derivative academic Fields of study may both interact with and develop independently of filmmaking  as in film theory and analysis  Fields of academic study have been created that are derivative or dependent on the existence of film  such as film criticism  film history  divisions of film propaganda in authoritarian governments  or psychological on subliminal effects of a flashing soda can during a screening  These fields may further create derivative fields  such as a movie review section in a newspaper or a television guide  Sub industries can spin off from film  such as popcorn makers  and toys  Sub  industries of pre existing industries may deal specifically with film  such as product placement in advertising  Terminology used Although the words  film  and  movie  are sometimes used interchangeably   film  is more often used when considering artistic  theoretical  or technical aspects  as studies in a university class and  movies  more often refers to entertainment or commercial aspects  as where to go for fun on a date  For example  a book titled  How to Read a Film  would be about the aesthetics or theory of film  while  Lets Go to the Movies  would be about the history of entertaining movies   Motion pictures  or  Moving pictures  are films and movies  A  DVD  is a digital format which may be used to reproduce an analog film  while  videotape    video   was for many decades a solely analog medium onto which moving images could be recorded and electronically  rather than optically  reproduced  Strictly speaking   Film  refers to the media onto which a visual image is shot  and to this end it may seem improper for work in other  moving image  media to be referred to as a  film  and the action of shooting as  filming   though these terms are still in general use   Silent films  need not be silent  but are films and movies without an audible dialogue  though they may have a musical soundtrack   Talkies  refers to early movies or films having audible dialogue or analog sound  not just a musical accompaniment   Cinema  either broadly encompasses both films and movies  or is roughly synonymous with  Film   both capitalized when referring to a category of art  The  silver screen  refers to classic black and white films before color  not to contemporary films without color  The expression  Sight and Sound   as in the film journal of the same name  means  film   The following icons mean film  a  candle and bell   as in the films Tarkovsky  of a segment of film stock  or a two faced Janus image  and an image of a movie camera in profile   Widescreen  and  Cinemascope  refers to a larger width to height in the frame  compared to an earlier historic aspect ratios  3  A  feature length film   or  feature film   is of a conventional full length  usually 60 minutes or more  and can commercially stand by itself without other films in a ticketed screening  4  A  short  is a film that is not as long as a feature length film  usually screened with other shorts  or preceding a feature length film  An  independent  is a film made outside of the conventional film industry  A  screening  or  projection  is the projection of a film or video on a screen at a public or private theater  usually but not always of a film  but of a video or DVD when of sufficient projection quality  A  double feature  is a screening of two independent  stand alone  feature films  A  viewing  is a watching of a film  A  showing  is a screening or viewing on an electronic monitor   Sales  refers to tickets sold at a theater  or more currently  rights sold for individual showings  A  release  is the distribution and often simultaneous screening of a film  A  preview  is a screening in advance of the main release   Hollywood  may be used either as a pejorative adjective  shorthand for asserting an overly commercial rather than artistic intent or outcome  as in  too Hollywood   or as a descriptive adjective to refer to a film originating with people who ordinarily work near Los Angeles  Expressions for Genres of film are sometimes used interchangeably for  film  in a specific context  such as a  porn  for a film with explicit sexual content  or  cheese  for films that are light  entertaining and not highbrow  Any film may also have a  sequel   which portrays events following those in the film  Bride of Frankenstein is an early example  When there are a number of films with the same characters  we have a  series   such as the James Bond series  A film which portrays events that occur earlier than those in another film  but is released after that film  is sometimes called a  prequel   an example being Butch and Sundance  The Early Days  Credits is a list of the people involved in making the film  Before the 1970s  credits were usually at the beginning of a film  Since then  the credits roll at the end of most films  A Post credits scene is a scene shown after the end of the credits  Ferris Bueller s Day Off has a post credit scene in which Ferris tells the audience that the movie is over and they should go home  Preview Main article  Test screening A preview performance refers to a showing of a movie to a select audience  usually for the purposes of corporate promotions  before the public film premiere itself  Previews are sometimes used to judge audience reaction  which if unexpectedly negative  may result in recutting or even refilming certain sections  Audience response   Trailer Main article  Film trailer Trailers or previews are film advertisements for films that will be exhibited in the future at a cinema  on whose screen they are shown  The term  trailer  comes from their having originally been shown at the end of a film programme  That practice did not last long  because patrons tended to leave the theater after the films ended  but the name has stuck  Trailers are now shown before the film  or the A movie in a double feature program  begins  Film  or other art form  Film may be combined with performance art and still be considered or referred to as a  film   for instance  when there is a live musical accompaniment to a silent film  Another example is audience participation films  as at a midnight movies screening of The Rocky Horror Picture Show  where the audience dresses up in costume from the film and loudly does a karaoke like reenactment along with the film  Performance art where film is incorporated as a component is usually not called film  but a film  which could stand alone but is accompanied by a performance may still be referred to as a film  The act of making a film can  in and of itself  be considered a work of art  on a different level from the film itself  as in the films of Werner Herzog  Similarly  the playing of a film can be considered to fall within the realm of political protest art  as in the subtleties within the films of Tarkovsky  A  road movie  can refer to a film put together from footage from a long road trip or vacation  Education and propaganda Main articles  Education and Propaganda Film is used for education and propaganda  When the purpose is primarily educational  a film is called an  educational film   Examples are recordings of lectures and experiments  or more marginally  a film based on a classic novel  Film may be propaganda  in whole or in part  such as the films made by Leni Riefenstahl in Nazi Germany  US war film trailers during World War II  or artistic films made under Stalin by Eisenstein  They may also be works of political protest  as in the films of Wajda  or more subtly  the films of Andrei Tarkovsky  The same film may be considered educational by some  and propaganda by others  such as some of the films of Michael Moore  Production Main article  Filmmaking At its core  the means to produce a film depend on the content the filmmaker wishes to show  and the apparatus for displaying it  the zoetrope merely requires a series of images on a strip of paper  Film production can therefore take as little as one person with a camera  or without it  such as Stan Brakhage s 1963 film Mothlight   or thousands of actors  extras and crewmembers for a live action  feature length epic  The necessary steps for almost any film can be boiled down to conception  planning  execution  revision  and distribution  The more involved the production  the more significant each of the steps becomes  In a typical production cycle of a Hollywood style film  these main stages are defined as  Development Pre production Production Post production Distribution This production cycle usually takes three years  The first year is taken up with development  The second year comprises preproduction and production  The third year  post production and distribution  The bigger the production  the more resources it takes  and the more important financing becomes  most feature films are not only artistic works  but for profit business entities  Crew Main article  Film crew A film crew is a group of people hired by a film company  employed during the  production  or  photography  phase  for the purpose of producing a film or motion picture  Crew are distinguished from cast  the actors who appear in front of the camera or provide voices for characters in the film  The crew interacts with but is also distinct from the production staff  consisting of producers  managers  company representatives  their assistants  and those whose primary responsibility falls in pre production or post production phases  such as writers and editors  Communication between production and crew generally passes through the director and his her staff of assistants  Medium to large crews are generally divided into departments with well defined hierarchies and standards for interaction and cooperation between the departments  Other than acting  the crew handles everything in the photography phase  props and costumes  shooting  sound  electrics  i e   lights   sets  and production special effects  Caterers  known in the film industry as  craft services   are usually not considered part of the crew  Technology Film stock consists of transparent celluloid  acetate  or polyester base coated with an emulsion containing light sensitive chemicals  Cellulose nitrate was the first type of film base used to record motion pictures  but due to its flammability was eventually replaced by safer materials  Stock widths and the film format for images on the reel have had a rich history  though most large commercial films are still shot on  and distributed to theaters  as 35 mm prints  Originally moving picture film was shot and projected at various speeds using hand cranked cameras and projectors  though 1000 frames per minute  16  frame s  is generally cited as a standard silent speed  research indicates most films were shot between 16 frame s and 23 frame s and projected from 18 frame s on up  often reels included instructions on how fast each scene should be shown   5  When sound film was introduced in the late 1920s  a constant speed was required for the sound head  24 frames per second was chosen because it was the slowest  and thus cheapest  speed which allowed for sufficient sound quality  Improvements since the late 19th century include the mechanization of cameras   allowing them to record at a consistent speed  quiet camera design   allowing sound recorded on set to be usable without requiring large  blimps  to encase the camera  the invention of more sophisticated filmstocks and lenses  allowing directors to film in increasingly dim conditions  and the development of synchronized sound  allowing sound to be recorded at exactly the same speed as its corresponding action  The soundtrack can be recorded separately from shooting the film  but for live action pictures many parts of the soundtrack are usually recorded simultaneously  As a medium  film is not limited to motion pictures  since the technology developed as the basis for photography  It can be used to present a progressive sequence of still images in the form of a slideshow  Film has also been incorporated into multimedia presentations  and often has importance as primary historical documentation  However  historic films have problems in terms of preservation and storage  and the motion picture industry is exploring many alternatives  Most movies on cellulose nitrate base have been copied onto modern safety films  Some studios save color films through the use of separation masters  three B amp W negatives each exposed through red  green  or blue filters  essentially a reverse of the Technicolor process   Digital methods have also been used to restore films  although their continued obsolescence cycle makes them  as of 2006  a poor choice for long term preservation  Film preservation of decaying film stock is a matter of concern to both film historians and archivists  and to companies interested in preserving their existing products in order to make them available to future generations  and thereby increase revenue   Preservation is generally a higher concern for nitrate and single strip color films  due to their high decay rates  black and white films on safety bases and color films preserved on Technicolor imbibition prints tend to keep up much better  assuming proper handling and storage  Some films in recent decades have been recorded using analog video technology similar to that used in television production  Modern digital video cameras and digital projectors are gaining ground as well  These approaches are preferred by some moviemakers  especially because footage shot with digital cinema can be evaluated and edited with non linear editing systems  NLE  without waiting for the film stock to be processed  Yet the migration is gradual  and as of 2005 most major motion pictures are still shot on film  Independent Main article  Independent film Independent filmmaking often takes place outside of Hollywood  or other major studio systems  An independent film  or indie film  is a film initially produced without financing or distribution from a major movie studio  Creative  business  and technological reasons have all contributed to the growth of the indie film scene in the late 20th and early 21st century  The Lumi re Brothers On the business side  the costs of big budget studio films also leads to conservative choices in cast and crew  There is a trend in Hollywood towards co financing  over two thirds of the films put out by Warner Bros  in 2000 were joint ventures  up from 10  in 1987   6  A hopeful director is almost never given the opportunity to get a job on a big budget studio film unless he or she has significant industry experience in film or television  Also  the studios rarely produce films with unknown actors  particularly in lead roles  Before the advent of digital alternatives  the cost of professional film equipment and stock was also a hurdle to being able to produce  direct  or star in a traditional studio film  But the advent of consumer camcorders in 1985  and more importantly  the arrival of high resolution digital video in the early 1990s  have lowered the technology barrier to movie production significantly  Both production and post production costs have been significantly lowered  today  the hardware and software for post production can be installed in a commodity based personal computer  Technologies such as DVDs  FireWire connections and non linear editing system pro level software like Adobe Premiere Pro  Sony Vegas and Apple s Final Cut Pro  and consumer level software such as Apple s Final Cut Express and iMovie  and Microsoft s Windows Movie Maker make movie making relatively inexpensive  Since the introduction of DV technology  the means of production have become more democratized  Filmmakers can conceivably shoot and edit a movie  create and edit the sound and music  and mix the final cut on a home computer  However  while the means of production may be democratized  financing  distribution  and marketing remain difficult to accomplish outside the traditional system  Most independent filmmakers rely on film festivals to get their films noticed and sold for distribution  The arrival of internet based video outlets such as YouTube and Veoh has further changed the film making landscape in ways that are still to be determined  Open content film Main article  Open content film An open content film is much like an independent film  but it is produced through open collaborations  its source material is available under a license which is permissive enough to allow other parties to create fan fiction or derivative works  than a traditional copyright  Like independent filmmaking  open source filmmaking takes place outside of Hollywood  or other major studio systems  Fan film Main article  Fan film A fan film is a film or video inspired by a film  television program  comic book or a similar source  created by fans rather than by the source s copyright holders or creators  Fan filmmakers have traditionally been amateurs  but some of the more notable films have actually been produced by professional filmmakers as film school class projects or as demonstration reels  Fan films vary tremendously in length  from short faux teaser trailers for non existent motion pictures to rarer full length motion pictures  Distribution Main articles  Film distribution and Film release When it is initially produced  a feature film is often shown to audiences in a movie theater or cinema  The identity of the first theater designed specifically for cinema is a matter of debate  candidates include Tally s Electric Theatre  established 1902 in Los Angeles  7  and Pittsburgh s Nickelodeon  established 1905  8  Thousands of such theaters were built or converted from existing facilities within a few years  9  In the United States  these theaters came to be known as nickelodeons  because admission typically cost a nickel  five cents   Typically  one film is the featured presentation  or feature film   Before the 1970s  there were  double features   typically  a high quality  A picture  rented by an independent theater for a lump sum  and a  B picture  of lower quality rented for a percentage of the gross receipts  Today  the bulk of the material shown before the feature film consists of previews for upcoming movies and paid advertisements  also known as trailers or  The Twenty    Historically  all mass marketed feature films were made to be shown in movie theaters  The development of television has allowed films to be broadcast to larger audiences  usually after the film is no longer being shown in theaters  citation needed  In 1967  videocassettes of movies became available to consumers to watch in their own homes  10  Recording technology has since enabled consumers to rent or buy copies of films on VHS or DVD  and the older formats of laserdisc  VCD and SelectaVision   see also videodisc   and Internet downloads may be available and have started to become revenue sources for the film companies  Some films are now made specifically for these other venues  being released as a television movie or direct to video movies  The production values on these films are often considered to be of inferior quality compared to theatrical releases in similar genres  and indeed  some films that are rejected by their own movie studios upon completion are distributed through these markets  The movie theater pays an average of about 50 55  of its ticket sales to the movie studio  as film rental fees  11  The actual percentage starts with a number higher than that  and decreases as the duration of a film s showing continues  as an incentive to theaters to keep movies in the theater longer  However  today s barrage of highly marketed movies ensures that most movies are shown in first run theaters for less than 8 weeks  There are a few movies every year that defy this rule  often limited release movies that start in only a few theaters and actually grow their theater count through good word of mouth and reviews  According to a 2000 study by ABN AMRO  about 26  of Hollywood movie studios  worldwide income came from box office ticket sales  46  came from VHS and DVD sales to consumers  and 28  came from television  broadcast  cable  and pay per view   11  This section requires expansion with  optical disc distribution  Animation Main article  Animation Animation is the technique in which each frame of a film is produced individually  whether generated as a computer graphic  or by photographing a drawn image  or by repeatedly making small changes to a model unit  see claymation and stop motion   and then photographing the result with a special animation camera  When the frames are strung together and the resulting film is viewed at a speed of 16 or more frames per second  there is an illusion of continuous movement  due to the persistence of vision   Generating such a film is very labor intensive and tedious  though the development of computer animation has greatly sped up the process  Because animation is very time consuming and often very expensive to produce  the majority of animation for TV and movies comes from professional animation studios  However  the field of independent animation has existed at least since the 1950s  with animation being produced by independent studios  and sometimes by a single person   Several independent animation producers have gone on to enter the professional animation industry  Limited animation is a way of increasing production and decreasing costs of animation by using  short cuts  in the animation process  This method was pioneered by UPA and popularized by Hanna Barbera  and adapted by other studios as cartoons moved from movie theaters to television  12  Although most animation studios are now using digital technologies in their productions  there is a specific style of animation that depends on film  Cameraless animation  made famous by moviemakers like Norman McLaren  Len Lye and Stan Brakhage  is painted and drawn directly onto pieces of film  and then run through a projector  Future state This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  While motion picture films have been around for more than a century  film is still a relative newcomer in the pantheon clarification needed  of fine arts  In the 1950s  when television became widely available  industry analysts who   predicted the demise of local movie theaters  citation needed  Despite competition from television s increasing technological sophistication over the 1960s and 1970s citation needed  such as the development of color television and large screens  motion picture cinemas continued  In fact with the rise of television s predominance  film began to become more respected as an artistic medium by contrast due the low general opinion of the quality of average television content  citation needed  In the 1980s  when the widespread availability of inexpensive videocassette recorders enabled people to select films for home viewing  industry analysts again wrongly predicted the death of the local cinemas  citation needed  In the 1990s and 2000s  the development of DVD players  home theater amplification systems with surround sound and subwoofers  and large LCD or plasma screens enabled people to select and view films at home with greatly improved audio and visual reproduction  citation needed  These new technologies provided audio and visual that in the past only local cinemas had been able to provide  a large  clear widescreen presentation of a film with a full range  high quality multi speaker sound system  Once again industry analysts predicted the demise of the local cinema  Local cinemas will be changing in the 21st century and moving towards digital screens  a new approach which will allow for easier and quicker distribution of films  via satellite or hard disks   a development which may give local theaters a reprieve from their predicted demise  citation needed  The cinema now faces a new challenge from home video by the likes of a new high definition  HD  format  Blu ray  which can provide full HD 1080p video playback at near cinema quality  citation needed  Video formats are gradually catching up with the resolutions and quality that film offers  1080p in Blu ray offers a pixel resolution of 1920 1080  a leap from the DVD offering of 720 480 and the 330 480 offered by the first home video standard  VHS  citation needed Ultra HD  a future digital video format  will offer a resolution of 7680 4320  However  the nature and structure of film prevents an apples to apples comparison with regard to resolution  13  The resolving power of film  and its ability to capture an image which can later be scanned to a digital format  will ensure that film remains a viable medium for some time to come  citation needed  Currently the super 16 format is seeing use as a capture medium  with digital scanning and post production providing good results  14  15  Despite advances in digital capture  film still offers unsurpassed ability to capture fine detail beyond what is possible with digital image sensors  A 35 mm film frame  with proper exposure and processing  still offers an equivalent resolution in the range of 500 mega pixels  13  Despite the rise of all new technologies  the development of the home video market and a surge of online copyright infringement  2007 was a record year in film that showed the highest ever box office grosses  Many who   expected film to suffer as a result of the effects listed above but it has flourished  strengthening film studio expectations for the future  citation needed  See also Genre Fiction film
