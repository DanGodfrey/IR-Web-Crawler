hides her in a tower  saving the powers of the flower for herself  and raising her as her own child  Every year  on Rapunzel s birthday  her parents and their subjects release thousands of sky lanterns  in the hope that the lost princess will return  Rapunzel has seen these over the years from her high tower  Nearing her 18th birthday  she asks Gothel to take her outside to see the source of the annual floating lights as her present  but Gothel refuses  Meanwhile  the charismatic Flynn Rider and accomplices steal the tiara of the lost princess  During the ensuing chase  Maximus  horse of the Captain of the Guards  is separated from his rider and continues the search for Flynn alone  Flynn outwits his accomplices  takes the tiara  and stumbles upon Rapunzel s tower  He climbs up it and in but is knocked unconscious by a frightened Rapunzel  who hides him in a wardrobe  When Gothel returns  Rapunzel tries to show her the captive but is fiercely barked down by Gothel  Gothel tells her she is never leaving the tower  But the forlorn but sharp Rapunzel instead asks for Gothel a special paint for her birthday found three days journey away  Gothel leaves and Rapunzel takes Flynn out of her closet and ties him to a chair  When revived  she tells him that she will give him the tiara if he takes her to see the lights  Flynn takes her to the Snuggly Duckling Inn  which is full of Gaul thugs  in hopes of scaring her into giving up her quest  but the thugs are charmed by Rapunzel  who encourages them to follow their dreams  Mother Gothel sees Maximus riderless and worries someone will find Rapunzel  She returns to the tower to find Rapunzel gone  Meanwhile  the guards invade the tavern  but Rapunzel and Flynn Rider have escaped  The pursuit ends at a dam  which Maximus causes to collapse  Flynn and Rapunzel are trapped in a flooding cave  Believing he s about to die  Flynn admits his true name  Eugene Fitzherbert  Rapunzel admits she has hair that glows when she sings  Using her hairlight  they find a way out  Later  when Flynn goes to gather firewood  Gothel meets Rapunzel insisting that Flynn does not care for her and merely wants the tiara  Gothel gives Rapunzel the tiara  suggesting that she test Flynn by giving it to him  The next morning  Maximus confronts Flynn but Rapunzel befriends the horse and convinces him to help them instead  They arrive at the kingdom and Flynn takes Rapunzel to see the lanterns  There  Rapunzel gives Flynn back the tiara  Flynn spies his old accomplices and leaves Rapunzel waiting as he gives them the tiara back

 Production Tangled was in development for six years and cost more than  260 million to produce  2  It had originally been announced in April 2007 that Annie nominated animator and story artist Dean Wellins would be co directing the film alongside Glen Keane  5  On October 9  2008  it was reported that Keane and Wellins had stepped down as directors  and were replaced by the team of Byron Howard and Nathan Greno  director and storyboard director  respectively  of Disney s 2008 animated feature Bolt  Keane stayed on as an executive producer and animation supervisor  while Wellins moved on to developing other short and feature films  6   edit  Title change Official logo of Rapunzel  before it was changed to Tangled  When first put into production  the film was promoted as having the title Rapunzel Unbraided  which was later changed to Rapunzel  7  Disney s previous animated feature The Princess and the Frog in 2009  while being well received by various critics 8  and taking in nearly  270 million worldwide  was not as successful as Disney had hoped  9  Disney expressed the belief that the film s emphasis on princesses may have discouraged young boys from seeing the film  9  In order to market the film to both sexes  Disney changed the film s name from Rapunzel to Tangled while also emphasizing Flynn Rider  the film s prominent male character  9  Disney was criticized for altering the classic title as a marketing strategy  Floyd Norman  a former Disney and Pixar animator and story artist  said   The idea of changing the title of a classic like Rapunzel to Tangled is beyond stupid  I m convinced they ll gain nothing from this except the public seeing Disney as desperately trying to find an audience   10  Justin Chang of Variety compared it to changing the title of The Little Mermaid to Beached  11  On November 24  2010  the day of the film s release  directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard disputed reports that the title change was a marketing decision  They said they changed the title from Rapunzel to Tangled because Rapunzel is not the only main character in the film  They went on to say that you can t call Toy Story  Buzz Lightyear   and they really needed a title that represented what the film is  and that it s a duo  and it stars Rapunzel and Flynn Rider  12   edit  Animation A concept rendering of Rapunzel  demonstrating the  luscious hair  Keane wanted  The film was made using computer generated imagery  CGI   although Tangled was modeled on the traditional look of oil paintings on canvas  The Rococo paintings of French artist Jean Honor  Fragonard  particularly The Swing  were used as references for the film s artistic style  a style described by Keane as  romantic and lush   13  To create the impression of a painting  non photorealistic rendering has been used  Glen Keane wanted the film to look and feel like a traditional hand drawn Disney film in 3D  and held a seminar called  The Best of Both Worlds   where he  with 50 Disney CGI artists and traditional artists  focused on the pros and cons of each style  14  Due to limitations in computer technology  many basic principles of animation used in traditionally animated movies had been absent from earlier CGI films  but technological advancements have made it easier to blend the two  combining the strengths of each style  Keane stated repeatedly he was trying to make the computer  bend its knee to the artist  instead of having the computer dictate the artistic style and look of the film  By making the computer become as  pliable as the pencil   Keane s vision of a  three dimensional drawing  seemed within reach  with the artist controlling the technology  Many of the techniques and tools that were required to give the film the quality Keane demanded did not exist when the project was started  and Disney Animation Studios had to create them on their own  13  Keane said   There s no photoreal hair  I want luscious hair  and we are inventing new ways of doing that  I want to bring the warmth and intuitive feel of hand drawn to CGI   15  One of the main goals of the animators was to create movement that mimicked the soft fluidity of the hand drawn art found in older Disney animated films  Keane credited Disney 3D animator Kyle Strawitz with helping to combine CGI with the traditional hand drawn style   He took the house from Snow White and built it and painted it so it looked like a flat painting that suddenly started to move  and it had dimension and kept all of the soft  round curves of the brushstrokes of watercolor  Kyle helped us get that Fragonard look of that girl on the swing  We are using subsurface scattering and global illumination and all of the latest techniques to pull off convincing human characters and rich environments   13  Existing CGI technology continued to present difficulties  in particular  animating hair turned out to be a challenge  Senior software engineer Kelly Ward spent six years writing programs to make it move the way they wanted  16  As late as January 2010  the directors were still not sure if the Rapunzel character s length of hair was going to work  These problems were finally solved in March  17  An improved version of a hair simulation program named Dynamic Wires  originally developed for Bolt  was eventually used  To make hair float believably in water  and to surmount other similar challenges  discrete differential geometry was used to produce the desired effects  freeing the animators from executing these specific tasks directly  which would have taken days instead of minutes  18  Rather than focusing on realism  the 3D team used an aesthetic approach  Robert Newman  the film s stereoscopic supervisor said that  We re using depth more artistically than ever before  and we re not as concerned with the literal transcription of depth between camera and projector as we are the interpretation of it   To do this  they used a new technique called multi rigging  which is made up by multiple pairs of virtual cameras  Each pair is used individually on each separate element that adds depth to a scene  like background  foreground and characters  without adjusting for the relation with the other pairs  When sandwiched together later in production  the result was something that would be visually impossible in the real world  but which created an appealing look to the movie  19   edit  Music Tangled  Original Soundtrack Soundtrack album by Alan Menken Released November 16  2010 Recorded 2010 Genre Folk rock  medieval  soundtrack Label Walt Disney Walt Disney Animation Studios chronology The Princess and the Frog  2009  Tangled  2010  Winnie the Pooh  2011  The original score was composed for the movie by 8 time Academy Award winner Composer Alan Menken with lyrics written by Glenn Slater  20  Menken said he attempted to blend medieval music with 1960s folk rock to create the new songs  21  Several songs were written but eventually cut from the final film   When Will My Life Begin   replaced an earlier version called  What More Could I Ever Need    Menken reported that that opening number went through five or six different versions  22  Elsewhere  Menken reported that there was originally a love song called  You Are My Forever  that Mother Gothel sang to Rapunzel in a motherly way but was reprised later in the film by Flynn in a romantic way  This idea was apparently replaced with the two songs  Mother Knows Best  and  I See the Light   23  The song  Something That I Want  performed by Grace Potter from Grace Potter and the Nocturnals is featured in the closing credits  This version features some of the lyrics that were re written and sung by Potter herself  The Latin American Spanish version of the song  titled  Algo quiero querer   was recorded by Colombian pop singer  Fanny L   24  The album has peaked at No  44 on the Billboard 200  No  7 on the Soundtrack chart  and No  3 on the Top Kids

and enjoyable  but not groundbreaking   35  Berardinelli also stated Rapunzel is  not as memorable as Snow White  Princess Ariel  or Belle  as well as stating  the songs are neither catchy nor memorable   35  Todd McCarthy  film reviewer for The Hollywood Reporter opened his review with   It would have been nice if Disney s self touted 50th animated feature were one of its best  a film that could stand with the studio s classics  but the world will have to make do with Tangled  a passably entertaining hodgepodge of old and new animation techniques  mixed sensibilities and hedged commercial calculations   36  Most reviews have praised the animation  notably the sky lantern sequence   I See The Light   in the film  some comparing it to the ballroom scene in Beauty and the Beast
