Dow Jones Industrial Average From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search Recent logarithmic graph of the DJIA from Jan 2000 through Jul 2011  Historical logarithmic graph of the DJIA from the 1890s to the late 2000s  The Dow Jones Industrial Average     da   d o nz    also called the Industrial Average  the Dow Jones  the Dow 30  or simply the Dow  is a stock market index  and one of several indices created by Wall Street Journal editor and Dow Jones  amp  Company co founder Charles Dow  It was founded on May 26  1896  and is now owned by Dow Jones Indexes  which is majority owned by the CME Group  The average is named after Dow and one of his business associates  statistician Edward Jones  It is an index that shows how 30 large  publicly owned companies based in the United States have traded during a standard trading session in the stock market  1  It is the second oldest U S  market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Average  which was also created by Dow  The Industrial portion of the name is largely historical  as many of the modern 30 components have little or nothing to do with traditional heavy industry  The average is price weighted  and to compensate for the effects of stock splits and other adjustments  it is currently a scaled average  The value of the Dow is not the actual average of the prices of its component stocks  but rather the sum of the component prices divided by a divisor  which changes whenever one of the component stocks has a stock split or stock dividend  so as to generate a consistent value for the index  Along with the NASDAQ Composite  the S amp P 500 Index  and the Russell 2000 Index  the Dow is among the most closely watched U S  benchmark indices tracking targeted stock market activity  Although Dow compiled the index to gauge the performance of the industrial sector within the American economy  the index s performance continues to be influenced by not only corporate and economic reports  but also by domestic and foreign political events such as war and terrorism  as well as by natural disasters that could potentially lead to economic harm  Components of the Dow trade on both the NASDAQ OMX and the NYSE Euronext  two of the largest stock market companies  Derivatives of the Dow trade on the Chicago Board Options Exchange and through the CME Group  the world s largest futures exchange company  which owns 90  of the indexing business founded by Dow Jones  including the Industrial Average  2  3  Contents 1 Components 2 Former components 3 History 3 1 Early years 3 2 Post war years 3 3 Dot

48 times in its 115 year history  and only General Electric remains in the index  As of 2011  General Electric has had the longest continuous presence on the index  with its latest addition being in 1907  When companies are replaced  the scale factor used to calculate the index is adjusted so that the value of the average remains the same  A summary of the more recent changes to the index includes the following  On February 19  2008  Chevron and Bank of America replaced Altria Group and Honeywell  Chevron had previously been a Dow component from July 18  1930  to November 1  1999  During Chevron s absence  its split adjusted price per share had gone from forty four dollars to eighty five  while the price of petroleum had risen from twenty four dollars to a hundred  On September 22  2008  Kraft Foods replaced the American International Group  AIG  in the index  5  On June 8  2009  General Motors and Citigroup were replaced by The Travelers Companies and Cisco Systems  which became the third company traded on the NASDAQ to be part of the Dow  6   edit  History  edit  Early years The Dow Jones Industrial Average was founded by Charles Dow on May 26  1896  and represented the dollar average of 12 stocks from leading American industries  Previously in 1884  Dow had composed an initial stock average called the Dow Jones Averages  which contained nine railroads and two industrial companies that appeared in the Customer s Afternoon Letter  a daily two page financial news bulletin which was the precursor to The Wall Street Journal  The original group of 12 stocks ultimately chosen to form the Dow Jones Industrial Average did not contain any railroad stocks  but purely industrial stocks  Of these  only General Electric currently remains part of that index  7  The other 11 were  8  American Cotton Oil Company  a predecessor company to Bestfoods  now part of Unilever  American Sugar Company  became Domino Sugar in 1900  now Domino Foods  Inc  American Tobacco Company  broken up in a 1911 antitrust action  Chicago Gas Company  bought by Peoples Gas Light in 1897  now an operating subsidiary of Integrys Energy Group  Distilling  amp  Cattle Feeding Company  now Millennium Chemicals  formerly a division of LyondellBasell  the latter of which recently emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy  9  Laclede Gas Company  still in operation as the Laclede Group  Inc   removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1899  National Lead Company  now NL Industries  removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1916  North American Company  an electric utility holding company  broken up by the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  in 1946  Tennessee Coal  Iron and Railroad Company in Birmingham  Alabama  bought by U S  Steel in 1907  U S  Steel was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1991  U S  Leather Company  dissolved in 1952  United States Rubber Company  changed its name to Uniroyal in 1961  merged with private B F  Goodrich in 1986  bought by Michelin in 1990  When it was first published in the late 1890s  the index stood at a level of 40 94  but ended up hitting its all time low of 28 48 during the summer of 1896 during the depths of what later became known as the Panic of 1896  Many of the biggest percentage price moves in the Dow occurred early in its history  as the nascent industrial economy matured  A brief war in 1898 between the U S  and the Spanish Empire might have only had a minor impact in the Dow s direction  citation needed  The decade of the 1900s would see the Dow halt its momentum as it worked its way through a pair of cataclysmic financial crises  the Panic of 1901 and the Panic of 1907  The Dow would be stuck in a trading range of between the 50 and 100 point levels till late 1909  The negativity surrounding the 1906 San Francisco earthquake did little to improve the economic climate  International disturbances such as the Russo Japanese War were few and far between and seemed to have little if any influence on the Dow  The average would end off the decade near the vicinity of the 100 point level  citation needed  At the start of the 1910s  the decade would begin with the Panic of 1910 1911 stifling economic growth for a lengthy period of time  History would later take its course on July 30  1914  as the average stood at a level of 71 42 when a decision was made to close down the New York Stock Exchange  and suspend trading for a span of 4  months  Some historians believe the exchange closed because of a concern that markets would plunge as a result of panic over the onset of World War I  An alternative explanation is that the Secretary of the Treasury  William Gibbs McAdoo  closed the exchange because he wanted to conserve the U S  gold stock in order to launch the Federal Reserve System later that year  with enough gold to keep the U S  at par with the gold standard  When the markets reopened on December 12  1914  the index closed at 54  a drop of 24 39   10  Also  in trying to explain the huge percentage drop  there was a new recalculation performed on the index in September 1916  Additions to the index raised the number of companies to 20  resulting in a mathematical inconsistency to the average from previous years in the past including 1914  11  Following World War I  the U S  would experience another downturn in economic activity in what became known as the Post World War I recession  The Dow s performance would remain virtually unchanged from the closing value of the previous decade  adding only around 5   from about the 100 level to 105  citation needed  During the 1920s  specifically in 1928  the components of the Dow were increased to 30 stocks near the economic height of that decade  which was nicknamed the Roaring Twenties  The prosperous nature of the economic climate  muted the negative influence of an early 1920s recession plus certain international conflicts such as the Polish Soviet war  the Irish Civil War  the Turkish War of Independence and the initial phase of the Chinese Civil War  The Crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression returned the average to its starting point  almost 90  below its peak  By July 8  1932  following its intra day low of 40 56  the Dow would end up closing the session at 41 22  The high of 381 17 on September 3  1929  would not be surpassed until 1954  in inflation adjusted numbers  However  the bottom of the 1929 Crash came just 2  months later on November 13  1929  when intra day it was at the 195 35 level  closing slightly higher at 198 69  12  For the decade  the Dow would end off with a healthy 173  gain from around the 105 level to a level of 286  Marked by global instability  the 1930s contended with several consequential European and Asian outbreaks of war  leading up to catastrophic World War II  including the Spanish Civil War  the Second Italo Abyssinian War  the Soviet Japanese Border War and the Second Sino Japanese War  On top of that  the U S  dealt with a painful recession in 1937 and 1938  The largest one day percentage gain in the index  15 34   happened on March 15  1933  in the depths of the 1930s bear market  However  as a whole  the Dow posted some of its worst performances  for a negative return  For the decade  the average was down from around the 286 level to 148  a loss of about 48    edit  Post war years This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Post war reconstruction during the 1940s  along with renewed optimism of peace and prosperity  brought about a 39  surge in the Dow from around the 148 level to 206  The strength in the Dow occurred despite a brief recession in 1949 and other global conflicts which started a short time later including the latter stages of the Chinese Civil War  the Greek Civil War  the Indo Pakistani War of 1947 and the 1948 Arab Israeli War  During the 1950s  the Korean War  the Algerian War  the Cold War and other political tensions such as the Cuban Revolution  as well as widespread political and economic changes in Africa during the initial stages of European Decolonization  did not stop the Dow s bullish climb higher  Additionally  the U S  would also make its way through two grinding recessions  one in 1953 and another in 1958  A 200  increase in the average from a level of 206 to 616 ensued over the course of that decade  The Dow s bullish behavior began to stall during the 1960s as the U S  became entangled with foreign political issues  They included the Bay of Pigs Invasion involving Cuba  the Vietnam War  the Portuguese Colonial War  the Colombian Civil War which the U S  assisted with short lived counter guerrilla campaigns  as well as domestic issues such as the Civil Rights Movement and several influential political assassinations  For the decade though  and despite a mild recession between 1960 and 1961  the average still managed a respectable 30  gain from the 616 level to 800  The 1970s marked a time of economic uncertainty and troubled relations between the U S  and certain Middle Eastern countries  To begin with  the decade started off with the ongoing Recession of 1969 70  Following that  the 1970s Energy Crisis ensued which included the 1973 75 recession  the 1973 Oil Crisis as well as the 1979 energy crisis beginning as a prelude to a disastrous economic climate injected with stagflation  the combination between high unemployment and high inflation  However  on November 14  1972  the average closed above the 1 000 mark  1 003 16  for the first time  during a brief relief rally in the midst of a lengthy bear market  Between January 1973 and December 1974  the average lost 48  of its value in what became known as the 1973 1974 Stock Market Crash  with the situation being exacerbated by the events surrounding the Yom Kippur War  Although the Vietnam War ended in 1975  new tensions arose towards Iran surrounding the Iranian Revolution in 1979  Other notable disturbances such as the Lebanese Civil War  the Ethiopian Civil War  the Indo Pakistani War of 1971 and the Angolan Civil War which the U S  and Soviet Union considered critical to the global balance of power  seemed to have had little influence towards the financial markets  Performance wise for the decade  gains remained virtually flat  rising less than 5  from about the 800 level to 838  The Dow fell 22 61  on Black Monday  1987  from about the 2 500 level to around 1 750  Two days later  it rose 10 15  above the 2 000 level for a mild recovery attempt  The 1980s saw a rapid increase in the average  though severe corrections did occur along the way  The largest one day percentage drop occurred on Black Monday  October 19  1987  when the average fell 22 61   There were no clear reasons given to explain the crash  but program trading may have been a major contributing factor  On October 13  1989  the Dow stumbled into another downfall  the 1989 Mini Crash which initiated the collapse of the junk bond market as the Dow registered a loss of almost 7   However  for the rest of the 1980s as a whole  the Dow made a 228  increase from the 838 level to 2 753  despite the market crashes  Silver Thursday  an Early 1980s recession  the 1980s oil glut  the Japanese asset price bubble and other political distractions such as the Soviet War in Afghanistan  the Falklands War  the Iran Iraq War  the Second Sudanese Civil War and the First Intifada in the Middle East   edit  Dot com boom This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article

To start off  the markets contended with the 1990 oil price shock compounded with the effects of the Early 1990s recession and a brief European situation surrounding Black Wednesday  Certain influential foreign conflicts such as the 1991 Soviet coup d  tat attempt which took place as part of the initial stages of the Dissolution of the USSR and the Fall of Communism  the First and Second Chechen Wars  the Persian Gulf War and the Yugoslav Wars failed to dampen economic enthusiasm surrounding the ongoing Information Age and the  Irrational Exuberance   a phrase coined by Alan Greenspan  of the Internet Boom  Even the occurrences of the Rwandan Genocide and the Second Congo War  termed as  Africa s World War  that involved 8 separate African nations which together between the two killed over 5 million people  didn t seem to have any noticeable negative financial impact on the Dow either  Between late 1992 and early 1993  the Dow staggered through the 3 000 level making only modest gains as the Biotechnology sector suffered through the downfall of the Biotech Bubble  as many biotech companies saw their share prices rapidly rise to record levels and then subsequently fall to new all time lows  A linear chart which approximates the shape of the rise in the DJIA during the 1990s acceleration  From a trading low of under 4 000 in 1990 to above the 12 000 mark in the year 2000 with intermittent slides throughout the decade  On November 21  1995  the DJIA closed above the 5 000 level  5 023 55  for the first time  Over the following two years  the Dow would rapidly tower above the 6 000 level during the month of October in 1996  and the 7 000 level in February 1997  On its march higher into record territory  the Dow easily made its way through the 8 000 level in July 1997  However  later in that year during October  the events surrounding the Asian Financial Crisis plunged the Dow into a 554 point loss to a close of 7 161 15  a retrenchment of 7 18  in what became known as the 1997 Mini Crash  Although internationally there was negativity surrounding the 1998 Russian financial crisis  the Dow would go on to surpass the 9 000 level during the month of April in 1998  making its sentimental push towards the symbolic 10 000 level  On March 29  1999  the average closed above the 10 000 mark  10 006 78  after flirting with it for two weeks  This prompted a celebration on the trading floor  complete with party hats  The scene at the exchange made front page headlines on many U S  newspapers such as The New York Times  On May 3  1999  the Dow achieved its first close above the 11 000 mark  11 014 70   Total gains for the decade exceeded 315   from the 2 753 level to 11 497  The Dow averaged a 5 3  return compounded annually for the 20th century  a record Warren Buffett called  a wonderful century   when he calculated that to achieve that return again  the index would need to close at about 2 000 000 by December 2099  13  Even during the height of the dot com era  authors James K  Glassman and Kevin A  Hassett went so far as to publish a book entitled Dow 36 000  The New Strategy for Profiting From the Coming Rise in the Stock Market  Their theory was to imply that stocks were still cheap and it was not too late to benefit from rising prices during the Internet boom  Characterized by fear on the part of newer investors  the uncertainty of the 2000s brought on a significant bear market  There was indecision on whether the cyclical bull market represented a prolonged temporary bounce or a new long term trend  Ultimately  there was widespread resignation and disappointment as the lows were revisited  and in some cases  surpassed near the end of the decade   edit  September 11 attacks The third largest one day point drop in DJIA history  and largest at the time  occurred on September 17  2001  the first day of trading after the September 11  2001 attacks  when the Dow fell 684 81 points  or 7 1   It should be noted that the Dow had been in a downward trend for virtually all of 2001 prior to Sept 11  losing well over 1000 points between Jan 2 and Sept  10  and had lost 187 51 points on Sept  6  followed by losing 235 4 points on Sept  7  14  By the end of that week  the Dow had fallen 1 369 70 points  or 14 3   However  the Dow began an upward trend shortly after the attacks and quickly regained all lost ground to close above the 10 000 level for the year  The Dow fell 14 3  from the mid 9 000 level to the low 8 000 level after the September 11  2001 attacks  Exchanges were closed between September 10 and September 17  During 2002  the average remained subdued without making substantial gains due to the Stock market downturn of 2002 as well as the lingering effects of the Dot com bubble  In 2003  the Dow held steady within the 7 000 to 9 000 point level range by the Early 2000s Recession  the Afghan War and the Iraq War  But by December of that year  the Dow remarkably returned to the 10 000 mark  In October 2006  four years after its bear market low  the DJIA set fresh record theoretical  intra day  daily close  weekly  and monthly highs for the first time in almost seven years  closing above the 12 000 level for the first time on the 19th anniversary of Black Monday  1987   On February 27  2007  the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3 3   415 30 points   its biggest point drop since 2001  The initial drop was caused by a global sell off after Chinese stocks experienced a Mini Crash  yet by April 25  the Dow passed the 13 000 level in trading and closed above that milestone for the first time  On July 19  2007  the average passed the 14 000 level  completing the fastest 1 000 point advance for the index since 1999  One week later  a 450 point intra day loss  owing to turbulence in the U S  sub prime mortgage market and the soaring value of the yuan  15  16  initiated another correction falling below the 13 000 mark  about 10  from its highs  On October 9  2007  the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at the record level of 14 164 53  Two days later on October 11  the Dow would trade at its highest intra day level ever  at the 14 198 10 mark  17  In what would normally take many years to accomplish  numerous reasons were cited for the Dow s extremely rapid rise from the 11 000 level in early 2006  to the 14 000 level in late 2007  They included future possible takeovers and mergers  healthy earnings reports particularly in the tech sector  and moderate inflationary numbers  fueling speculation the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates  Roughly on par with the 2000 record when adjusted for inflation  this represented the final high of the cyclical bull   edit  Late 2000s recession On September 15  2008  a wider financial crisis became evident when Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy along with the economic effect of record high oil prices which reached almost  150 per barrel two months earlier  The DJIA lost more than 500 points for only the sixth time in history  returning to its mid July lows below the 11 000 level  A series of  bailout  packages  including the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008  proposed and implemented by the Federal Reserve and U S  Treasury  as well as FDIC sponsored bank mergers  did not prevent further losses  After two months of extreme volatility during which the Dow experienced its largest one day point loss  largest daily point gain  and largest intra day range  more than 1 000 points   the index closed at a new twelve year low of 6 547 05 on March 9  2009  after an intra day low of 6 469 95 18  during the March 6 session   its lowest close since April 1997  and had lost 20  of its value in only six weeks  Towards the latter half of 2009  the average rallied towards the 10 000 level amid optimism that the Late 2000s Recession  the United States Housing Bubble and the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 2009  were easing and possibly coming to an end  For the decade  the Dow saw a rather substantial pullback for a negative return from the 11 497 level to 10 428  a loss of a little over 9   During the early part of the 2010s  the Dow made a fairly notable rally attempt in the face of growing global concerns such as the 2010 European sovereign debt crisis and the Dubai debt crisis  Although for the most part just a political event  the Dow closed at the 10 785 89 level on March 22  2010 following the passage of the landmark Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in Washington  On May 6  2010  just after 2 30 pm EDT  the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by 998 50 points  an intra day loss of 9 2   The event later became known as the 2010 Flash Crash or the  Flash Crash   19  Although there was an immediate recovery  it was the biggest intra day fall ever  This would have put the trading day as the fifth worst market sell off on a percentage basis as well  The Dow bottomed out at 9 869  and then recovered quickly  eventually ending at 10 520 32  a loss of 347 80 points or 3 2   19  On February 1  2011  the Dow settled at the 12 040 16 level  reaching past the 12 000 mark for the first time in over two and a half years  20  Following negative reaction to news surrounding the United States debt ceiling crisis  the Dow closed in correction territory at the 11 383 68 level  after a 512 76 point drop on August 4  2011  Later on August 8  following the U S  Sovereign debt downgrade from Standard  amp  Poor s to AA  from AAA  the Dow plummeted 634 76 points to close at 10 809 85  its first close under 11 000 since November 2010  21  On February 28  2012  the Dow closed above the 13 000 level for the first time since May 19  2008  settling at 13 005 12  With the Dow also reaching a new closing high of 13 252 76 on March 15  and an intraday high of 13 331 77 later on March 16  the index still remains 6 5  below its all time intraday high   edit  Investing Investing in the DJIA is made widely accessible in equities through exchange traded funds  ETFs  as well as in derivatives through option contracts and futures contracts   edit  Equities Within equities  asset manager SSgA  issue a family of ETFs the SPDRs  one of which attempts to match the daily performance of the index  the DIAMONDS  introduced in 1998  NYSE  DIA   Another asset management firm  ProFunds  issue other related DJIA ETFs through ProShares such as the Inverse Performance  NYSE  DOG  for a bearish strategy on the average  That is  when the Dow trades in negative territory  the ETF trades higher  thus  making it not needed to sell short if one has a bearish goal in mind  Due to the advent of pre market trading  the DIAMONDS ETF provides a very accurate opening value for the average  As an example  if the ETF opens the trading session with a 76  loss  then that would strongly indicate roughly a 76 point loss for the Dow within the first few seconds or so  even before all of its components open for trade  Likewise  if the ETF starts the trading session higher by  1 12  then that would signal an approximate gain for the Dow of 112 points at the open  even if some components begin trading at 9 31 am or 9 33 am due to a delay   edit  Leveraged equities Profunds also issues the 2x  NYSE  DDM   which attempts to match the daily performance of the DJIA by 200  and the Inverse 2x  NYSE  DXD   which attempts to match the inverse daily performance by 200   In the case of 2x performance  the ETF increases the buying power by leveraging money without using margin  Currently  there are also 3x performance ETFs issued by ProShares that exist too  which attempt to replicate  300  leverage  against the Dow  For 3x performance  the symbol is  NYSE  UDOW   and for Inverse 3x performance  it is

respectively  Trading is typically carried out in an Open Outcry auction  or over an electronic network such as CME s Globex platform   edit  Options contracts The Chicago Board Options Exchange  CBOE  issues Options Contracts on the Dow through the root symbol DJX in combination with long term expiration options called DJX LEAPS  Concerning equities  the exchange issues options contracts on Performance ETFs  Inverse Performance ETFs  2x Performance ETFs  Inverse 2x Performance ETFs  3x Performance ETFs  and Inverse 3x Performance ETFs   edit  Calculation To calculate the DJIA  the sum of the prices of all 30 stocks is divided by a divisor  the Dow Divisor  The divisor is adjusted in case of stock splits  spinoffs or similar structural changes  to ensure that such events do not in themselves alter the numerical value of the DJIA  Early on  the initial divisor was composed of the original number of component companies  which made the DJIA at first  a simple arithmetic average  The present divisor  after many adjustments  is less than one  meaning the index is larger than the sum of the prices of the components   That is  where p are the prices of the component stocks and d is the Dow Divisor  Events like stock splits or changes in the list of the companies composing the index alter the sum of the component prices  In these cases  in order to avoid discontinuity in the index  the Dow Divisor is updated so that the quotations right before and after the event coincide  The Dow Divisor is currently 0 132129493  24  Presently  every  1 change in price in a particular stock within the average  equates to a 7 57  1 0 132129493  point movement   edit  Assessment With the current inclusion of only 30 stocks  critics like Ric Edelman argue that the DJIA is not a very accurate representation of overall market performance  Still  it is the most cited and most widely recognized of the stock market indices  25  26  Additionally  the DJIA is criticized for being a price weighted average  which gives higher priced stocks more influence over the average than their lower priced counterparts  but takes no account of the relative industry size or market capitalization of the components  For example  a  1 increase in a lower priced stock can be negated by a  1 decrease in a much higher priced stock  even though the lower priced stock experienced a larger percentage change  In addition  a  1 move in the smallest component of the DJIA has the same effect as a  1 move in the largest component of the average  The Dow would see the negative effects of this price weighted average during September October 2008 with a former component AIG  Before its reverse split adjusted stock price change  the stock collapsed from  22 76 on September 8 to  1 35 on October 27  contributing to a roughly 3 000 point drop in the index  27  As of March 2012  IBM and Caterpillar are among the highest priced stocks in the average and therefore have the greatest influence on it  Alternately  Bank of America and Alcoa are among the lowest priced stocks in the average and have the least amount of sway in the price movement  Many critics of the DJIA recommend the float adjusted market value weighted S amp P 500 or the Wilshire 5000  the latter of which includes all U S  equity securities  as better indicators of the U S  stock market   edit  See also Dow
