LGBT social movements From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search See also  LGBT rights by country or territory and Timeline of LGBT history Gay rights demonstration in New York City  1976  Lesbian  gay  bisexual  and transgender social movements share inter related goals of social acceptance of sexual and gender minorities  Lesbian  gay  bisexual  and transgender  LGBT  people and their allies have a long history of campaigning for what is generally called LGBT rights  also called gay rights and gay and lesbian rights  Various communities have worked not only together  but also independent of each other in various configurations including gay liberation  lesbian feminism  the queer movement and transgender activism  There is no one organization representing all LGBT people and interests  although arguably two organizations come close  InterPride by coordinating and networking gay pride events worldwide  and International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission  IGLHRC  which addresses human rights violations against LGBT and HIV positive people and works with the United Nations are seen as broadly inclusive all LGBT communities and interests  A commonly stated goal is social equality for LGBT people  some have also focused on building LGBT communities  or worked towards liberation for the broader society from sexual oppression  1  LGBT movements organized today are made up of a wide range of political activism and cultural activity  such as lobbying and street marches  social groups  support groups and community events  magazines  films and literature  academic research and writing  and even business activity  Workers of the Taiwan Tongzhi Hotline Association participating in 2005 Taiwan Pride parade in Taipei

Authors    Digital   LaborLinguistic   Reproductive v t e Sociologist Mary Bernstein writes   For the lesbian and gay movement  then  cultural goals include  but are not limited to  challenging dominant constructions of masculinity and femininity  homophobia  and the primacy of the gendered heterosexual nuclear family  heteronormativity   Political goals include changing laws and policies in order to gain new rights  benefits  and protections from harm   2  Bernstein emphasizes that activists seek both types of goals in both the civil and political spheres  As with other social movements  there is also conflict within and between LGBT movements  especially about strategies for change and debates over exactly who comprises the constituency that these movements represent  There is debate over to what extent lesbians  gays  bisexuals  transgendered people  intersexed people and others share common interests and a need to work together  Leaders of the lesbian and gay movement of the 1970s  80s and 90s often attempted to hide masculine lesbians  feminine gay men  transgendered people  and bisexuals from the public eye  creating internal divisions within LGBT communities  3  LGBT movements have often adopted a kind of identity politics that sees gay  bisexual and or transgender people as a fixed class of people  a minority group or groups  Those using this approach aspire to liberal political goals of freedom and equal opportunity  and aim to join the political mainstream on the same level as other groups in society  4  In arguing that sexual orientation and gender identity are innate and cannot be consciously changed  attempts to change gay  lesbian and bisexual people into heterosexuals   conversion therapy   are generally opposed by the LGBT community  Such attempts are often based in religious beliefs that perceive gay  lesbian and bisexual activity as immoral  However  others within LGBT movements have criticised identity politics as limited and flawed  elements of the queer movement have argued that the categories of gay and lesbian are restrictive  and attempted to deconstruct those categories  which are seen to  reinforce rather than challenge a cultural system that will always mark the nonheterosexual as inferior   5  After the French Revolution the anticlerical feeling in Catholic countries coupled with the liberalizing effect of the Napoleonic Code made it possible to sweep away sodomy laws  However  in Protestant countries  where the tyranny of the church was less severe  there was no general reaction against statutes that were religious in origin  As a result  many of those countries retained their statutes on sodomy until late in the 20th century  The prominent Nazi jurist Rudolf Klare argued for the moral superiority of harsh anti homosexual Teutonic traditions  such as Germany  England and American states  over Latin countries  such as France  Spain  Italy  and Poland  which no longer punished homosexual acts  6   edit  History See also  Timeline of LGBT history  edit  Before 1860 In eighteenth and nineteenth century Europe  same sex sexual behaviour and cross dressing were widely considered to be socially unacceptable  and were serious crimes under sodomy and sumptuary laws  There were  however  some exceptions  For example  in the 17th century cross dressing was common in plays  as  for example  evident in the content of many of William Shakespeare s plays  and by the actors in the actual performances  since female roles in Elizabethan Theater were always performed by males  usually prepubescent boys   And Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart s opera  Apollo et Hyacinthus  was performed by males only  although the libretto differed from the original text of Ovidius to reduce homosexual relations among Apollon  Hyacinthus  and Zephyrus  Many Native American cultures also widely respected individuals who  in today s terms  might have been transgender  bisexual or homosexual  stating that they embodied characteristics of both male and female counterparts  Thomas Cannon wrote what may be the earliest published defence of homosexuality in English  Ancient and Modern Pederasty Investigated and Exemplify d  1749   Social reformer Jeremy Bentham wrote the first known argument for homosexual law reform in England around 1785  at a time when the legal penalty for buggery was death by hanging  7  However  he feared reprisal  and his powerful essay was not published until 1978  The emerging currents of secular humanist thought which had inspired Bentham also informed the French Revolution  and when the newly formed National Constituent Assembly began drafting the policies and laws of the new republic in 1792  groups of militant  sodomite citizens  in Paris petitioned the Assembl e nationale  the governing body of the French Revolution  for freedom and recognition  8  In 1791 France became the first nation to decriminalise homosexuality  probably thanks in part to the homosexual Jean Jacques R gis de Cambac r s who was one of the authors of the Napoleonic code  In 1830  the new Penal Code of the Brazilian Empire did not repeat the title XIII of fifth book of the  Ordena  es Philipinas   which made sodomy a crime  In 1833  an anonymous English language writer wrote a poetic defence of Captain Nicholas Nicholls  who had been sentenced to death in London for sodomy  Whence spring these inclinations  rank and strong  And harming no one  wherefore call them wrong  8  Three years later in Switzerland  Heinrich Hoessli published the first volume of Eros  Die M nnerliebe der Griechen   Eros  The Male love of the Greeks    another defence of same sex love  8  During that period  Poland never criminalized homosexuality  18th century Poland was marked by an Enlightenment driven tolerant attitude to sexuality  with public figures reported to engage in homosexual activities or transvestitism  Such  scandalous  events drew public attention  but did not result in prosecution  One example is Poland s last king  Stanislaw August Poniatowski  who was said to have slept with the British ambassador in his youth  After the partitions of Poland Polish territories came under control of the Russian Empire  the Austro Hungarian Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia  the law of those countries ruled homosexual acts illegal  Nevertheless  prominent figures were known to form homosexual relationships  including Narcyza  michowska  1819 1876   a writer and founder of the Polish feminist movement  who used her private experiences in her writing  9   edit

2009  Karl Heinrich Ulrichs  German gay rights activist of the 1860s From the 1870s  social reformers in other countries had begun to defend homosexuality  but their identities were kept secret  A secret British society called the  Order of Chaeronea  campaigned for the legalisation of homosexuality  and counted playwright Oscar Wilde among its members in the last decades of the 19th century  10  In the 1890s  English socialist poet Edward Carpenter and Scottish anarchist John Henry Mackay wrote in defense of same sex love and androgyny  Carpenter and British homosexual rights advocate John Addington Symonds contributed to the development of Havelock Ellis s groundbreaking book Sexual Inversion  which called for tolerance towards  inverts  and was suppressed when first published in England  In Europe and America  a broader movement of  free love  was also emerging from the 1860s among first wave feminists and radicals of the libertarian left  They critiqued Victorian sexual morality and the traditional institutions of family and marriage that were seen to enslave women  Some advocates of free love in the early 20th century  including Russian anarchist and feminist Emma Goldman  also spoke in defence of same sex love and challenged repressive legislation  In 1897  German doctor and writer Magnus Hirschfeld formed the Scientific Humanitarian Committee to campaign publicly against the notorious law  Paragraph 175   which made sex between men illegal  Adolf Brand later broke away from the group  disagreeing with Hirschfeld s medical view of the  intermediate sex   seeing male male sex as merely an aspect of manly virility and male social bonding  Brand was the first to use  outing  as a political strategy  claiming that German Chancellor Bernhard von B low engaged in homosexual activity  May 14  1928 issue of German lesbian periodical Die Freundin  The Girlfriend   The 1901 book Sind es Frauen  Roman  ber das dritte Geschlecht  Are These Women  Novel about the Third Sex  by Aim e Duc was as much a political treatise as a novel  criticising pathological theories of homosexuality and gender inversion in women  11  Anna R ling  delivering a public speech in 1904 at the request of Hirschfeld  became the first female Uranian activist  R ling  who also saw  men  women  and homosexuals  as three distinct genders  called for an alliance between the women s and sexual reform movements  but this speech is her only known contribution to the cause  Women only began to join the previously male dominated sexual reform movement around 1910 when the German government tried to expand Paragraph 175 to outlaw sex between women  Heterosexual feminist leader Helene St cker became a prominent figure in the movement  Friedrich Radszuweit published LGBT literature and magazines in Berlin  for example  Die Freundin    Hirschfeld  whose life was dedicated to social progress for people who were transsexual  transvestite and homosexual  formed the Institut f r Sexualwissenschaft  Institute for Sexology  in 1919  The institute conducted an enormous amount of research  saw thousands of transgender and homosexual clients at consultations  and championed a broad range of sexual reforms including sex education  contraception and women s rights  However  the gains made in Germany would soon be drastically reversed with the rise of Nazism  and the institute and its library were destroyed in 1933  The Swiss journal Der Kreis was the only part of the movement to continue through the Nazi era  The Russian Revolution of 1917 decriminalised homosexuality and recognised same sex marriage  citation needed  This was a remarkable step in Russia of the time   which was very backward economically and socially  and where many conservative attitudes towards sexuality prevailed  This step was part of a larger project of freeing sexual relationships and expanding women s rights   including legalising abortion  granting divorce on demand  equal rights for women  and attempts to socialise house work  With the era of Stalin  however  Russia reverted all these progressive measures   re criminalising homosexuality and imprisoning gay men and banning abortion  In the United States  several secret or semi secret groups were formed explicitly to advance the rights of homosexuals as early as the turn of the 20th century  but little is known about them  12  A better documented group is Henry Gerber s The Society for Human Rights formed in Chicago in 1924  which was quickly suppressed  13  Cover of U S  lesbian publication  The Ladder  from October 1957  The motif of masks and unmasking was prevalent in the homophile era  prefiguring the political strategy of coming out and giving the Mattachine Society its name  After 1918  the newly independent Polish state returned to the Napoleonic tradition and the 1932 criminal code did not specify homosexuality as a crime  The police still used gross indecency laws instead to harass homosexuals  but the gay community in Poland thrived  with many important public figures  such as the composer Karol Szymanowski  the poet Boles aw Le mian and the novelists Jaros aw Iwaszkiewicz and Maria D browska being of homosexual orientation  The German Nazi invasion of 1939 put an end to it  9   edit  1945 1968 Main article  Homophile Immediately following World War II  a number of homosexual rights groups came into being or were revived across the Western world  in Britain  France  Germany  Holland  the Scandinavian countries and the United States  These groups usually preferred the term  homophile  to  homosexual   emphasizing love over sex  The homophile movement began in the late 1940s with groups in the Netherlands and Denmark  and continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s with groups in Sweden  Norway  the United States  France  Britain and elsewhere  ONE  Inc   the first public homosexual organization in the U S  14  was bankrolled by the wealthy transsexual man Reed Erickson  A U S  transgender rights journal  Transvestia  The Journal of the American Society for Equality in Dress  also published two issues in 1952  The homophile movement lobbied to establish a prominent influence in political systems of social acceptability  radicals of the 1970s would later disparage the homophile groups for being assimilationist  Any demonstrations were orderly and polite  15  By 1969  there were dozens of homophile organizations and publications in the U S  16  and a national organization had been formed  but they were largely ignored by the media  A 1965 gay march held in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia  according to some historians  marked the beginning of the modern gay rights movement  Meanwhile in San Francisco in 1966  transgender street prostitutes in the poor neighborhood of Tenderloin rioted against police harassment at a popular all night restaurant  Gene Compton s Cafeteria  After the introduction of Soviet style communism to Poland  the 1948 law stated that the age of consent for all sexual acts  homosexual or heterosexual  was 15  However  the powerful influence of the Roman Catholic Church made open homosexuality a matter of scandal  While a gay poet Grzegorz Musia  could publish officially  Jerzy Andrzejewski s last novel dealing with the subject of homosexuality was censored  While the gay subculture grew  with official and underground press alike discussing the subject of homosexuality  the traditionally conservative attitudes towards sexuality were used by the secret police to harass and put pressure on individuals  9   edit  1969 1974 Main article  Gay Liberation See also  1970s in LGBT rights The new social movements of the sixties  such as the Black Power and anti Vietnam war movements in the U S  the May 1968 insurrection in France  and Women s Liberation throughout the Western world  inspired some LGBT activists to become more radical  15  and the Gay Liberation Movement emerged towards the end of the decade  This new radicalism is often attributed to the Stonewall riots of 1969  when a group of transsexual  butch femme lesbians  drag queens and gay male patrons at a bar in New York resisted a police raid  13  Although Gay Liberation was already underway  Stonewall certainly provided a rallying point for the fledgling movement  Immediately after Stonewall  such groups as the Gay Liberation Front  GLF  and the Gay Activists  Alliance  GAA  were formed  Their use of the word  gay  represented a new unapologetic defiance   as an antonym for  straight    respectable sexual behaviour    it encompassed a range of non normative sexualities and gender expressions  such as transgender street prostitutes  and sought ultimately to free the bisexual potential in everyone  rendering obsolete the categories of homosexual and heterosexual  17  18  According to Gay Lib writer Toby Marotta   their Gay political outlooks were not homophile but liberationist   19   Out  loud and proud   they engaged in colourful street theatre  20  The GLF s  A Gay Manifesto  set out the aims for the fledgling gay liberation movement  and influential intellectual Paul Goodman published  The Politics of Being Queer   1969   Chapters of the GLF were established across the U S  and in other parts of the Western world  The Front Homosexuel d Action R volutionnaire was formed in 1971 by lesbians who split from the Mouvement Homophile de France  One of the values of the movement was gay pride  Within weeks of the Stonewall Riots  Craig Rodwell  proprietor of the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop in lower Manhattan  was working to commemorate them by replacing the Annual Reminder  which had been held annually in at Independence Hall in Philadelphia since 1965  with a celebration of the Stonewall Riots  In September 1969  Rodwell and local lesbian allies led by Ellen Broidy  attended an Eastern Regional Conference of Homophile Organizations  ERCHO  meeting in Philadelphia and got it to vote to replace the Fourth of July Annual Reminder at Independence Hall in Philadelphia  which ERCHO had been sponsoring since 1965  with a first commemoration of the Stonewall Riots  Rodwell and the committee he assembled to organize this event spent the next nine months assembling the first end of June commemoration of the Stonewall Riots  Other liberation groups that had been formed during the previous year  consecutively  the Gay Liberation Front  Queens  the Gay Activists Alliance  Radicalesbians  and Street Transvestites Action Revolutionaries  STAR   asked for an opportunity to hold officially recommended commemorative events of their own  Rodwell and his committee accommodated them by organizing the first Gay Pride Week  The secretary of their planning committee circulated copies of their meeting minutes to movement leaders in cities throughout the country  Los Angeles held a big parade on the first Gay Pride Day  Smaller demonstrations were held in San Francisco  Chicago  and Boston   Toby Marotta   Organized by an early GLF leader Brenda Howard  the Stonewall riots were commemorated by annual marches that became known as Gay pride parades  From 1970 activists protested the classification of homosexuality as a mental illness by the American Psychiatric Association in their Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  and in 1974 it was replaced with a category of  sexual orientation disturbance  then  ego dystonic homosexuality   which was also deleted  although  gender identity disorder  remains  Sweden became first country in the world to allow people who were transsexual by legislation to correct their sex in 1972  and provides free hormone replacement therapy  equal age of consent set at 15   edit  1975 1986 From the anarchistic Gay Liberation Movement of the early 1970s arose a more reformist and single issue  Gay Rights Movement   which portrayed gays and lesbians as a minority group and used the language of civil rights   in many respects continuing the work of the homophile period  21  In Berlin  for example  the radical Homosexuelle Aktion Westberlin was eclipsed by the Allgemeine Homosexuelle Arbeitsgemeinschaft  22  Gay and lesbian rights advocates argued that one s sexual orientation does not reflect on one s gender  that is   you can be a man and desire a man    without any implications for your gender identity as a man   and the same is true if you are a woman  23  Gays and lesbians were presented as identical to heterosexuals in all ways but private sexual practices  and butch  bar dykes  and flamboyant  street queens  were seen as negative stereotypes of lesbians and gays  Veteran activists such as Sylvia Rivera and Beth Elliot were sidelined or expelled because they were transgender  In 1977  Harvey Milk was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors becoming the first openly gay man in the United States elected to public office  Milk was assassinated by a former city supervisor Dan White in 1978  In 1977  a former Miss America contestant and orange juice spokesperson  Anita Bryant  began a campaign  Save Our Children   in Dade County  Florida  greater Miami   which proved to be a major set back in the Gay Liberation movement  Essentially  she established an organization which put forth an amendment to the laws of the county which resulted in the firing of many public school teachers on the suspicion that they were homosexual  In 1979  a number of people in Sweden called in sick with a case of being homosexual  in protest of homosexuality being classified as an illness  This was followed by an activist occupation of the main office of the National Board of Health and Welfare  Within a few months  Sweden became the first country in the world to remove homosexuality as an illness  24  Lesbian feminism  which was most influential from the mid 1970s to the mid 1980s  encouraged women to direct their energies toward other women rather than men  and advocated lesbianism as the logical result of feminism  25  As with Gay Liberation  this understanding of the lesbian potential in all women was at odds with the minority rights framework of the Gay Rights movement  Many women of the Gay Liberation movement felt frustrated at the domination of the movement by men and formed separate organisations  some who felt gender differences between men and women could not be resolved developed  lesbian separatism   influenced by writings such as Jill Johnston s 1973 book Lesbian Nation  Disagreements between different political philosophies were  at times  extremely heated  and became known as the lesbian sex wars  26  clashing in particular over views on sadomasochism  prostitution and transsexuality  The term  gay  came to be more strongly associated with homosexual males  In Canada  the coming into effect of Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1985 saw a shift in the gay rights movement in Canada  as Canadian gays and lesbians moved from liberation to litigious strategies  Premised on Charter protections and on the notion of the immutability of homosexuality  judicial rulings rapidly advanced rights  including those that compelled the Canadian government to legalize same sex marriage  It has been argued that while this strategy was extremely effective in advancing the safety  dignity and equality of Canadian homosexuals  its emphasis of sameness came at the expense of difference and may have undermined opportunities for more meaningful change  27  The Rainbow flag Mark Segal  an early member of Gay Liberation  has continued to pave the road of gay equality  Many  who   refer to Mark Segal as the dean of American gay journalism  As a pioneer of the local gay press movement  he was one of the founders and former president of both The National Gay Press Association and the National Gay Newspaper Guild  He also is the founder and publisher of the award winning Philadelphia Gay News  As a young gay activist  Segal understood the power of media  In 1973 Segal disrupted the CBS evening news with Walter Cronkite  an event covered in newspapers across the country and viewed by 60  of American households  many seeing or hearing about homosexuality for the first time  Before the networks agreed to put a stop to censorship and bias in the news division  Segal went on to disrupt The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson  and Barbara Walters on The Today Show  The trade newspaper Variety claimed that Segal had cost the industry  750 000 in production  tape delays and lost advertising revenue  citation needed  Aside from publishing  Segal has also reported on gay life from far reaching places as Lebanon  Cuba  and East Berlin during the fall of the Berlin Wall  He and Bob Ross  former publisher of San Francisco s Bay Area Reporter represented the gay press and lectured in Moscow and St  Petersburg at Russia s first openly gay conference  referred to as Russia s Stonewall  He recently coordinated a network of local gay publications nationally to celebrate October as gay history month  with a combined print run reaching over a half million people  His determination to gain acceptance and respect for the gay press can be summed up by his 15 year battle to gain membership in the Pennsylvania Newspaper Association  one of the nation s oldest and most respected organizations for daily and weekly newspapers  The 15 year battled ended after the Philadelphia Inquirer  Philadelphia Daily News and the Pittsburgh Post Gazette joined forces and called for PGN s membership  Today Segal sits on the Board of Directors of PNA  In 2005  he produced Philadelphia s official July 4 concert for a crowd estimated at 500 000 people  The star studded show featured Sir Elton John  Pattie Labelle  Bryan Adams  and Rufus Wainwright  On a recent anniversary of PGN an editorial in the Philadelphia Inquirer stated  Segal and PGN continue to step up admirably to the challenge set for newspapers by H L  Menchen   To afflict the comfortable and to comfort the afflicted   citation needed   edit  1987   present Same sex

recognized Same sex relationships illegal   Minimal penalty   Large penalty   Life in prison   Death penalty v t e Some historians consider that a new era of the gay rights movement began in the 1980s with the emergence of AIDS  which decimated the leadership and shifted the focus for many  14  This era saw a resurgence of militancy with direct action groups like AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power  ACT UP   formed in 1987   and its offshoots Queer Nation  1990  and the Lesbian Avengers  1992   Some younger activists  seeing  gay and lesbian  as increasingly normative and politically conservative  began using queer as a defiant statement of all sexual minorities and gender variant people   just as the earlier liberationists had done with gay  Less confrontational terms that attempt to reunite the interests of lesbians  gays  bisexuals and transpeople also became prominent  including various acronyms like LGBT  LGBTQ  and LGBTI  where the Q and I stand for Questioning and Intersex respectively  In the 1990s  organizations began to spring up in non western countries  such as Progay Philippines  which was founded in 1993 and organized the first Gay Pride march in Asia on June 26  1994  In many countries  LGBT organizations remain illegal and transsexual  transgender and homosexual activists face extreme opposition from the state  citation needed  The 1990s also saw the emergence of many LGBT youth movements and organizations such as LGBT youth centers  Gay straight alliances in high schools and youth specific activism such as the National Day of Silence  The 1990s also saw a rapid push of the transgender movements  while at the same time a sidelining of the identity of those who are transsexual  In the English speaking world  Leslie Feinberg s   Transgender Liberation  A Movement Whose Time Has Come   The Story of Ben Wells   published in 1992  In 1993 Cheryl Chase founded the Intersex Society of North America  Gender different peoples across the globe also formed minority rights movements   Hijra activists campaigned for recognition as a third sex in India and Travesti groups began to organize against police brutality across Latin America  while activists in the United States formed direct confrontation groups such as Transexual Menace  In many cases  LGBTI rights movements came to focus on questions of intersectionality  the interplay of oppressions arising from being both queer and underclass  colored  disabled  etc  The Netherlands was the first country to allow same sex marriage  in 2001  As of today  same sex marriages are also legal in Sweden  Argentina  Belgium  Canada  Iceland  Norway  South Africa  Spain  and Portugal  along with six states in the United States  Massachusetts  Iowa  Connecticut  Vermont  New Hampshire  and New York  as well as the District of Columbia  28  During this same period  some municipalities have been enacting laws against homosexuality  E g   Rhea County  Tennessee unsuccessfully tried to  ban homosexuals  in 2006  29  From 6 to 9 November 2006  The Yogyakarta Principles on application of international human rights law in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity was adopted by international meeting of 29 specialists  International Commission of Jurists and International Service for Human Rights  On 13 December 2008  UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity was adopted by United Nations General Assembly  And on August 2010  Yogyakarta Principles in Action published  An Activist s Guide  for activists and human rights defenders  On 22 October 2009  the assembly of the Church of Sweden  voted strongly in favour of giving its blessing to homosexual couples   30  including the use of the term marriage    matrimony    The new law was introduced on November 1  2009 and is the first case in the world  In 2010 in the U S  an ad campaign was launched to inform people not to use the term  that s so gay  to mean  that s so stupid   due to the term s offensive nature  On 11 June 2010  Iceland became the first country in the world to legalize same sex marriage through a unanimous vote  49 0  31  On July 2010  Argentina became the first country in Latin America to legalize same sex marriage  On December 18  2010   Don t ask  don t tell   the 1993 law forbidding homosexual people from serving openly in the United States military  was repealed  This meant that gays and lesbians could now serve openly in the military without any fear of being discharged because of their sexual orientation  In 2012  The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity issued a regulation to prohibit discrimination in federally assisted housing programs  The new regulations ensure that the Department s core housing programs are open to all eligible persons  regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity   edit  Opposition See also  LGBT rights opposition LGBT movements are opposed by a variety of individuals and organizations   32  33  34  35  36  They may have a personal  moral  political or religious objection to gay rights  homosexual relations or gay people  Opponents have said same sex relationships are not marriages  37  that legalization of same sex marriage will open the door for the legalization of polygamy  38  that it is unnatural 39  and that it encourages unhealthy behavior  40  41  Some social conservatives believe that all sexual relationships with people other than an opposite sex spouse undermines the traditional family 42  and that children should be reared in homes with both a father and a mother  43  44  The 1990s saw the establishment of the ex gay movement  There is also concern that gay rights may conflict with individuals  freedom of speech  45  46  47  48  49  religious freedoms in the workplace  50  51  and the ability to run churches  52  charitable organizations 53  54  and other religious organizations 55  that hold opposing social and cultural views to LGBT rights  There is also concern that religious organizations might be forced to accept and perform same sex marriages or risk losing their tax exempt status  56  57  58  59  Eric Rofes author of the book  A Radical Rethinking of Sexuality and Schooling  Status Quo or Status Queer   argues that the inclusion of teachings on homosexuality in public schools will play an important role in transforming public ideas about lesbian and gay individuals  60  As a former teacher in the public school system  Rofes recounts how he was fired from his teaching position after making the decision to come out as gay  As a result of the stigma that he faced as a gay teacher he emphasizes the necessity of the public to take radical approaches to making significant changes in public attitudes about homosexuality  60  According to Rofes  radical approaches are grounded in the belief that  something fundamental needs to be transformed for authentic and sweeping changes to occur  The radical approaches proposed by Rofes have been met with strong opposition from anti gay rights activists such as John Briggs  Former California senator  John Briggs proposed Proposition 6  a ballot initiative that would require that all California state public schools fire any gay or lesbian teachers or counselors  along with any faculty that displayed support for gay rights in an effort to prevent what he believe to be   the corruption of the children s minds   61  The exclusion of homosexuality from the sexual education curriculum  in addition to the absence of sexual counseling programs in public schools  has resulted in increased feelings of isolation and alienation for gay and lesbian students who desire to have gay counseling programs that will help them come to terms with their sexual orientation  60  Eric Rofes founder of youth homosexual programs  such as Out There and Committee for Gay Youth  stresses the importance of having support programs that help youth learn to identify with their sexual orientation  David Campos  author of the book  Sex  Youth  and Sex Education  A Reference Handbook  illuminates the argument proposed by proponents of sexual education programs in public schools  Many gay rights supporters argue that teachings about the diverse sexual orientations that exist outside of heterosexuality are pertinent to creating students that are well informed about the world around them  However  Campos also acknowledges that the sex education curriculum alone cannot teach youth about factors associated with sexual orientation but instead he suggests that schools implement policies that create safe school learning environments and foster support for gay and lesbian  bisexual  and transgender youth  62  It is his belief that schools that provide unbiased  factual information about sexual orientation  along with supportive counseling programs for these homosexual youth will transform the way society treats homosexuality  62  Many opponents of LGBT social movements have attributed their indifference toward homosexuality as being a result of the immoral values that it may instill in children who are exposed to homosexual individuals  61  In opposition to this claim  many proponents of increased education about homosexuality suggest that educators should refrain from teaching about sexuality in schools entirely  In her book entitled  Gay and Lesbian Movement   Margaret Cruickshank provides statistical data from the Harris and Yankelvoich polls which confirmed that over 80  of American adults believe that students should be educated about sexuality within their public school  In addition  the poll also found that 75  of parents believe that homosexuality and abortion should be included in the curriculum as well  An assessment conducted on California public school systems discovered that only 2  of all parents actually disproved of their child being taught about sexuality in school  63  Overall  education has a consistent positive impact on support for same sex marriage  and African Americans statistically have lower rates of educational attainment  However  the education level of African Americans does not have as much significance on their attitude towards same sex marriage as it does on white attitudes  Educational attainment among whites has a significant positive effect on support for same sex marriage  whereas the direct effect of education among African Americans is less significant  White income level has a direct and positive correlation with support for same sex marriage  but African American income level is not significantly associated with attitudes toward same sex marriage  64  Location also affects ideas towards same sex marriage  residents of rural and southern areas are significantly more opposed to same sex marriage in comparison to residents elsewhere  Women are consistently more supportive than men of LGBT rights  and individuals that are divorced or have never married are also more likely to grant marital rights to same sex couples than married or widowed individuals  Also  white women are significantly more supportive than white men  but there are no gender discrepancies among African Americans  The year in which one was born is a strong indicator of attitude towards same sex marriage generations born after 1946 are considerably more supportive of same sex marriage than older generations  Statistics show that African Americans are more opposed to same sex marriage than any other ethnicity  65  Studies show that Non Protestants are much more likely to support same sex unions than Protestants  63  of African Americans claim that they are Baptist or Protestant  whereas only 30  of white Americans are  Religion  as measured by individuals  religious affiliations  behaviors  and beliefs  has a lot of influence in structuring same sex union attitudes and consistently influences opinions about homosexuality  The most liberal attitudes are generally reflected by Jews  liberal Protestants  and people who are not affiliated with religion  This is because many of their religious traditions have not  systematically condemned homosexual behaviors  in recent years  Moderate and tolerant attitudes are generally reflected by Catholics and moderate Protestants  And lastly  the most conservative views are held by Evangelical Protestants  Moreover  it is a tendency for one to be less tolerant of homosexuality if their social network is strongly tied to a religious congregation  Organized religion  especially Protestant and Baptist affiliations  espouse conservative views which traditionally denounce same sex unions  Therefore  these congregations are more likely to hear messages of this nature  Polls have also indicated that the amount and level of personal contact that individuals have with homosexual individuals and traditional morality affects attitudes of same sex marriage and homosexuality  66   edit  See also Age of consent Biphobia Civil rights Declaration of Montreal Gay culture Gay icon GLSEN Heterosexism Homosexual agenda International Day Against Homophobia LGBT
