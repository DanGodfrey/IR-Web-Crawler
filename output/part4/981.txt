action is of the order of Planck constant  quantum mechanics departs from classical mechanics primarily at the atomic and subatomic scales  the so called quantum realm  It provides a mathematical description of much of the dual particle like and wave like behavior and interactions of energy and matter  In advanced topics of quantum mechanics  some of these behaviors are macroscopic and only emerge at very low or very high energies or temperatures  The name  quantum mechanics  derives from the observation that some physical quantities can change only by discrete amounts  or quanta in Latin  For example  the angular momentum of an electron bound to an atom or molecule is quantized  1  In the context of quantum mechanics  the wave particle duality of energy and matter and the uncertainty principle provide a unified view of the behavior of photons  electrons and other atomic scale objects  The mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics are abstract  A mathematical function called the wavefunction provides information about the probability amplitude of position  momentum  and other physical properties of a particle  Mathematical manipulations of the wavefunction usually involve the bra ket notation  which requires an understanding of complex numbers and linear functionals  The wavefunction treats the object as a quantum harmonic oscillator and the mathematics is akin to that of acoustic resonance  Many of the results of quantum mechanics are not easily visualized in terms of classical mechanics  for instance  the ground state in the quantum mechanical model is a non zero energy state that is the lowest permitted energy state of a system  rather than a more traditional system that is thought of as simply being at rest with zero kinetic energy  Instead of a traditional static  unchanging zero state  quantum mechanics allows for far more dynamic  chaotic possibilities  according to John Wheeler  The earliest versions of quantum mechanics were formulated in the first decade of the 20th century  At around the same time  the atomic theory and the corpuscular theory of light  as updated by Einstein  first came to be widely accepted as scientific fact  these latter theories can be viewed as quantum theories of matter and electromagnetic radiation  The early quantum theory was significantly reformulated in the mid 1920s by Werner Heisenberg  Max Born  Wolfgang Pauli and their associates  and the Copenhagen interpretation of Niels Bohr became widely accepted  By 1930  quantum mechanics had been further unified and formalized by the work of Paul Dirac and John von Neumann  with a greater emphasis placed on measurement in quantum mechanics  the statistical nature of our knowledge of reality and philosophical speculation about the role of the observer  Quantum mechanics has since branched out into almost every aspect of 20th century physics and other disciplines such as quantum chemistry  quantum electronics  quantum optics and quantum information science  Much 19th century physics has been re evaluated as the classical limit of quantum mechanics  and its more advanced developments in terms of quantum field theory  string theory  and speculative quantum gravity theories  Contents 1 History 2 Mathematical formulations 3 Interactions with other scientific theories 3 1 Quantum mechanics and classical physics 3 2

history of quantum mechanics dates back to the 1838 discovery of cathode rays by Michael Faraday  This was followed by the 1859 statement of the black body radiation problem by Gustav Kirchhoff  the 1877 suggestion by Ludwig Boltzmann that the energy states of a physical system can be discrete  and the 1900 quantum hypothesis of Max Planck  2  Planck s hypothesis that energy is radiated and absorbed in discrete  quanta   or  energy elements   precisely matched the observed patterns of black body radiation  According to Planck  each energy element E is proportional to its frequency    where h is Planck s constant  Planck cautiously insisted that this was simply an aspect of the processes of absorption and emission of radiation and had nothing to do with the physical reality of the radiation itself  3  However  in 1905 Albert Einstein interpreted Planck s quantum hypothesis realistically and used it to explain the photoelectric effect  in which shining light on certain materials can eject electrons from the material  The 1927 Solvay Conference in Brussels  The foundations of quantum mechanics were established during the first half of the twentieth century by Niels Bohr  Werner Heisenberg  Max Planck  Louis de Broglie  Albert Einstein  Erwin Schr dinger  Max Born  John von Neumann  Paul Dirac  Wolfgang Pauli  David Hilbert  and others  In the mid 1920s  developments in quantum mechanics led to its becoming the standard formulation for atomic physics  In the summer of 1925  Bohr and Heisenberg published results that closed the  Old Quantum Theory   Out of deference to their dual state as particles  light quanta came to be called photons  1926   From Einstein s simple postulation was born a flurry of debating  theorizing and testing  Thus the entire field of quantum physics emerged  leading to its wider acceptance at the Fifth Solvay Conference in 1927  The other exemplar that led to quantum mechanics was the study of electromagnetic waves such as light  When it was found in 1900 by Max Planck that the energy of waves could be described as consisting of small packets or quanta  Albert Einstein further developed this idea to show that an electromagnetic wave such as light could be described as a particle   later called the photon   with a discrete quanta of energy that was dependent on its frequency  4  This led to a theory of unity between subatomic particles and electromagnetic waves called wave particle duality in which particles and waves were neither one nor the other  but had certain properties of both  While quantum mechanics traditionally described the world of the very small  it is also needed to explain certain recently investigated macroscopic systems such as superconductors and superfluids  The word quantum derives from Latin  meaning  how great  or  how much   5  In quantum mechanics  it refers to a discrete unit that quantum theory assigns to certain physical quantities  such as the energy of an atom at rest  see Figure 1   The discovery that particles are discrete packets of energy with wave like properties led to the branch of physics dealing with atomic and sub atomic systems which is today called quantum mechanics  It is the underlying mathematical framework of many fields of physics and chemistry  including condensed matter physics  solid state physics  atomic physics  molecular physics  computational physics  computational chemistry  quantum chemistry  particle physics  nuclear chemistry  and nuclear physics  6  Some fundamental aspects of the theory are still actively studied  7  Quantum mechanics is essential to understand the behavior of systems at atomic length scales and smaller  For example  if classical mechanics governed the workings of an atom  electrons would rapidly travel towards and collide with the nucleus  making stable atoms impossible  However  in the natural world the electrons normally remain in an uncertain  non deterministic  smeared   wave particle wave function  orbital path around or through the nucleus  defying classical electromagnetism  8  Quantum mechanics was initially developed to provide a better explanation of the atom  especially the differences in the spectra of light emitted by different isotopes of the same element  The quantum theory of the atom was developed as an explanation for the electron remaining in its orbit  which could not be explained by Newton s laws of motion and Maxwell s laws of classical electromagnetism  Broadly speaking  quantum mechanics incorporates four classes of phenomena for which classical physics cannot account  The quantization of certain physical properties Wave particle duality The uncertainty principle Quantum entanglement  Mathematical formulations Main article  Mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics See also  Quantum logic In the mathematically rigorous formulation of quantum mechanics developed by Paul Dirac 9  and John von Neumann  10  the possible states of a quantum mechanical system are represented by unit vectors  called  state vectors    Formally  these reside in a complex separable Hilbert space  variously called the  state space  or the  associated Hilbert space  of the system  well defined up to a complex number of norm 1  the phase factor   In other words  the possible states are points in the projective space of a Hilbert space  usually called the complex projective space  The exact nature of this Hilbert space is dependent on the system  for example  the state space for position and momentum states is the space of square integrable functions  while the state space for the spin of a single proton is just the product of two complex planes  Each observable is represented by a maximally Hermitian  precisely  by a self adjoint  linear operator acting on the state space  Each eigenstate of an observable corresponds to an eigenvector of the operator  and the associated eigenvalue corresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstate  If the operator s spectrum is discrete  the observable can only attain those discrete eigenvalues  In the formalism of quantum mechanics  the state of a system at a given time is described by a complex wave function  also referred to as state vector in a complex vector space  11  This abstract mathematical object allows for the calculation of probabilities of outcomes of concrete experiments  For example  it allows one to compute the probability of finding an electron in a particular region around the nucleus at a particular time  Contrary to classical mechanics  one can never make simultaneous predictions of conjugate variables  such as position and momentum  with accuracy  For instance  electrons may be considered to be located somewhere within a region of space  but with their exact positions being unknown  Contours of constant probability  often referred to as  clouds   may be drawn around the nucleus of an atom to conceptualize where the electron might be located with the most probability  Heisenberg s uncertainty principle quantifies the inability to precisely locate the particle given its conjugate momentum  12  According to one interpretation  as the result of a measurement the wave function containing the probability information for a system collapses from a given initial state to a particular eigenstate  The possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator representing the observable   which explains the choice of Hermitian operators  for which all the eigenvalues are real  We can find the probability distribution of an observable in a given state by computing the spectral decomposition of the corresponding operator  Heisenberg s uncertainty principle is represented by the statement that the operators corresponding to certain observables do not commute  The probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics thus stems from the act of measurement  This is one of the most difficult aspects of quantum systems to understand  It was the central topic in the famous Bohr Einstein debates  in which the two scientists attempted to clarify these fundamental principles by way of thought experiments  In the decades after the formulation of quantum mechanics  the question of what constitutes a  measurement  has been extensively studied  Newer interpretations of quantum mechanics have been formulated that do away with the concept of  wavefunction collapse   see  for example  the relative state interpretation  The basic idea is that when a quantum system interacts with a measuring apparatus  their respective wavefunctions become entangled  so that the original quantum system ceases to exist as an independent entity  For details  see the article on measurement in quantum mechanics  13  Generally  quantum mechanics does not assign definite values  Instead  it makes predictions using probability distributions  that is  it describes the probability of obtaining possible outcomes from measuring an observable  Often these results are skewed by many causes  such as dense probability clouds 14  or quantum state nuclear attraction  15  16  Naturally  these probabilities will depend on the quantum state at the  instant  of the measurement  Hence  uncertainty is involved in the value  There are  however  certain states that are associated with a definite value of a particular observable  These are known as eigenstates of the observable   eigen  can be translated from German as meaning inherent or characteristic   17  In the everyday world  it is natural and intuitive to think of everything  every observable  as being in an eigenstate  Everything appears to have a definite position  a definite momentum  a definite energy  and a definite time of occurrence  However  quantum mechanics does not pinpoint the exact values of a particle s position and momentum  since they are conjugate pairs  or its energy and time  since they too are conjugate pairs   rather  it only provides a range of probabilities of where that particle might be given its momentum and momentum probability  Therefore  it is helpful to use different words to describe states having uncertain values and states having definite values  eigenstate   Usually  a system will not be in an eigenstate of the observable  particle  we are interested in  However  if one measures the observable  the wavefunction will instantaneously be an eigenstate  or generalised eigenstate  of that observable  This process is known as wavefunction collapse  a controversial and much debated process  18  It involves expanding the system under study to include the measurement device  If one knows the corresponding wave function at the instant before the measurement  one will be able to compute the probability of collapsing into each of the possible eigenstates  For example  the free particle in the previous example will usually have a wavefunction that is a wave packet centered around some mean position x0  neither an eigenstate of position nor of momentum  When one measures the position of the particle  it is impossible to predict with certainty the result  13  It is probable  but not certain  that it will be near x0  where the amplitude of the wave function is large  After the measurement is performed  having obtained some result x  the wave function collapses into a position eigenstate centered at x  19  The time evolution of a quantum state is described by the Schr dinger equation  in which the Hamiltonian  the operator corresponding to the total energy of the system  generates time evolution  The time evolution of wave functions is deterministic in the sense that  given a wavefunction at an initial time  it makes a definite prediction of what the wavefunction will be at any later time  20  During a measurement  on the other hand  the change of the wavefunction into another one is not deterministic  it is unpredictable  i e  random  A time evolution simulation can be seen here  21  22  Wave functions can change as time progresses  An equation known as the Schr dinger equation describes how wavefunctions change in time  a role similar to Newton s second law in classical mechanics  The Schr dinger equation  applied to the aforementioned example of the free particle  predicts that the center of a wave packet will move through space at a constant velocity  like a classical particle with no forces acting on it  However  the wave packet will also spread out as time progresses  which means that the position becomes more uncertain  This also has the effect of turning position eigenstates  which can be thought of as infinitely sharp wave packets  into broadened wave packets that are no longer position eigenstates  23  Fig  1  Probability densities corresponding to the wavefunctions of an electron in a hydrogen atom possessing definite energy levels  increasing from the top of the image to the bottom  n   1  2  3       and angular momentum  increasing across from left to right  s  p  d        Brighter areas correspond to higher probability density in a position measurement  Wavefunctions like these are directly comparable to Chladni s figures of acoustic modes of vibration in classical physics and are indeed modes of oscillation as well  they possess a sharp energy and thus a keen frequency  The angular momentum and energy are quantized  and only take on discrete values like those shown  as is the case for resonant frequencies in acoustics   Some wave functions produce probability distributions that are constant  or independent of time  such as when in a stationary state of constant energy  time drops out of the absolute square of the wave function  Many systems that are treated dynamically in classical mechanics are described by such  static  wave functions  For example  a single electron in an unexcited atom is pictured classically as a particle moving in a circular trajectory around the atomic nucleus  whereas in quantum mechanics it is described by a static  spherically symmetric wavefunction surrounding the nucleus  Fig  1    Note that only the lowest angular momentum states  labeled s  are spherically symmetric   24  The Schr dinger equation acts on the entire probability amplitude  not merely its absolute value  Whereas the absolute value of the probability amplitude encodes information about probabilities  its phase encodes information about the interference between quantum states  This gives rise to the wave like behavior of quantum states  It turns out that analytic solutions of Schr dinger s equation are only available for a small number of model Hamiltonians  of which the quantum harmonic oscillator  the particle in a box  the hydrogen molecular ion and the hydrogen atom are the most important representatives  Even the helium atom  which contains just one more electron than hydrogen  defies all attempts at a fully analytic treatment  There exist several techniques for generating approximate solutions  For instance  in the method known as perturbation theory one uses the analytic results for a simple quantum mechanical model to generate results for a more complicated model related to the simple model by  for example  the addition of a weak potential energy  Another method is the  semi classical equation of motion  approach  which applies to systems for which quantum mechanics produces weak deviations from classical behavior  The deviations can be calculated based on the classical motion  This approach is important for the field of quantum chaos  There are numerous mathematically equivalent formulations of quantum mechanics  One of the oldest and most commonly used formulations is the transformation theory proposed by Cambridge theoretical physicist Paul Dirac  which unifies and generalizes the two earliest formulations of quantum mechanics  matrix mechanics  invented by Werner Heisenberg  25  26  and wave mechanics  invented by Erwin Schr dinger   27  In this formulation  the instantaneous state of a quantum system encodes the probabilities of its measurable properties  or  observables   Examples of observables include energy  position  momentum  and angular momentum  Observables can be either continuous  e g   the position of a particle  or discrete  e g   the energy of an electron bound to a hydrogen atom   28  An alternative formulation of quantum mechanics is Feynman s path integral formulation  in which a quantum mechanical amplitude is considered as a sum over histories between initial and final states  this is the quantum mechanical counterpart of action principles in classical mechanics  Interactions with other scientific theories The rules of quantum mechanics are fundamental  they assert that the state space of a system is a Hilbert space and that observables of that system are Hermitian operators acting on that space  they do not tell us which Hilbert space or which operators  These can be chosen appropriately in order to obtain a quantitative description of a quantum system  An important guide for making these choices is the correspondence principle  which states that the predictions of quantum mechanics reduce to those of classical physics when a system moves to higher energies or  equivalently  larger quantum numbers  i e  whereas a single particle exhibits a degree of randomness  in systems incorporating millions of particles averaging takes over and  at the high energy limit  the statistical probability of random behaviour approaches zero   In other words  classical mechanics is simply a quantum mechanics of large systems  This  high energy  limit is known as the classical or correspondence limit  One can even start from an established classical model of a particular system  and attempt to guess the underlying quantum model that would give rise to the classical model in the correspondence limit  Unsolved problems in physics In the correspondence limit of quantum mechanics  Is there a preferred interpretation of quantum mechanics  How does the quantum description of reality  which includes elements such as the  superposition of states  and  wavefunction collapse   give rise to the reality we perceive  When quantum mechanics was originally formulated  it was applied to models whose correspondence limit was non relativistic classical mechanics  For instance  the well known model of the quantum harmonic oscillator uses an explicitly non relativistic expression for the kinetic energy of the oscillator  and is thus a quantum version of the classical harmonic oscillator  Early attempts to merge quantum mechanics with special relativity involved the replacement of the Schr dinger equation with a covariant equation such as the Klein Gordon equation or the Dirac equation  While these theories were successful in explaining many experimental results  they had certain unsatisfactory qualities stemming from their neglect of the relativistic creation and annihilation of particles  A fully relativistic quantum theory required the development of quantum field theory  which applies quantization to a field rather than a fixed set of particles  The first complete quantum field theory  quantum electrodynamics  provides a fully quantum description of the electromagnetic interaction  The full apparatus of quantum field theory is often unnecessary for describing electrodynamic systems  A simpler approach  one employed since the inception of quantum mechanics  is to treat charged particles as quantum mechanical objects being acted on by a classical electromagnetic field  For example  the elementary quantum model of the hydrogen atom describes the electric field of the hydrogen atom using a classical Coulomb potential  This  semi classical  approach fails if quantum fluctuations in the electromagnetic field play an important role  such as in the emission of photons by charged particles  Quantum field theories for the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force have been developed  The quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force is called quantum chromodynamics  and describes the interactions of subnuclear particles  quarks and gluons  The weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force were unified  in their quantized forms  into a single quantum field theory known as electroweak theory  by the physicists Abdus Salam  Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg  These three men shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979 for this work  29  It has proven difficult to construct quantum models of gravity  the remaining fundamental force  Semi classical approximations are workable  and have led to predictions such as Hawking radiation  However  the formulation of a complete theory of quantum gravity is hindered by apparent incompatibilities between general relativity  the most accurate theory of gravity currently known  and some of the fundamental assumptions of quantum theory  The resolution of these incompatibilities is an area of active research  and theories such as string theory are among the possible candidates for a future theory of quantum gravity  Classical mechanics has been extended into the complex domain  and complex classical mechanics exhibits behaviours similar to quantum mechanics  30  Quantum mechanics and classical physics Predictions of quantum mechanics have been verified experimentally to an extremely high degree of accuracy  According to the correspondence principle between classical and quantum mechanics  all objects obey the laws of quantum mechanics  and classical mechanics is just an approximation for large systems  or a statistical quantum mechanics of a large collection of particles   The laws of classical mechanics thus follow from the laws of quantum mechanics as a statistical average at the limit of large systems or large quantum numbers  31  However  chaotic systems do not have good quantum numbers  and quantum chaos studies the relationship between classical and quantum descriptions in these systems  Quantum coherence is an essential difference between classical and quantum theories  and is illustrated by the Einstein Podolsky Rosen paradox  Quantum interference involves adding together probability amplitudes  whereas classical waves infer that there is an adding together of intensities  For microscopic bodies  the extension of the system is much smaller than the coherence length  which gives rise to long range entanglement and other nonlocal phenomena characteristic of quantum systems  32  Quantum coherence is not typically evident at macroscopic scales  although an exception to this rule can occur at extremely low temperatures  when quantum behavior can manifest itself on more macroscopic scales  see Bose Einstein condensate and Quantum machine   This is in accordance with the following observations  Many macroscopic properties of a classical system are a direct consequences of the quantum behavior of its parts  For example  the stability of bulk matter  which consists of atoms and molecules which would quickly collapse under electric forces alone   the rigidity of solids  and the mechanical  thermal  chemical  optical and magnetic properties of matter are all results of the interaction of electric charges under the rules of quantum mechanics  33  While the seemingly exotic behavior of matter posited by quantum mechanics and relativity theory become more apparent when dealing with extremely fast moving or extremely tiny particles  the laws of classical Newtonian physics remain accurate in predicting the behavior of the vast majority of large objects of the order of the size of large molecules and bigger at velocities much smaller than the velocity of light  34  Relativity and quantum mechanics Main articles  Quantum gravity and Theory of everything Even with the defining postulates of both Einstein s theory of general relativity and quantum theory being indisputably supported by rigorous and repeated empirical evidence and while they do not directly contradict each other theoretically  at least with regard to primary claims   they are resistant to being incorporated within one cohesive model  35  Einstein himself is well known for rejecting some of the claims of quantum mechanics  While clearly contributing to the field  he did not accept the more philosophical consequences and interpretations of quantum mechanics  such as the lack of deterministic causality  he is famously quoted as saying in response to this aspect   My God does not play with dice   and the assertion that a single subatomic particle can occupy numerous areas of space at one time  He also was the first to notice some of the apparently exotic consequences of entanglement and used them to formulate the Einstein Podolsky Rosen paradox  in the hope of showing that quantum mechanics had unacceptable implications  This was 1935  but in 1964 it was shown by John Bell  see Bell inequality  that  although Einstein was correct in identifying seemingly paradoxical implications of quantum mechanical nonlocality  these implications could be experimentally tested  Alain Aspect s initial experiments in 1982  and many subsequent experiments since  have verified quantum entanglement  According to the paper of J  Bell and the Copenhagen interpretation  the common interpretation of quantum mechanics by physicists since 1927   and contrary to Einstein s ideas  quantum mechanics was not at the same time a  realistic  theory and a local theory  The Einstein Podolsky Rosen paradox shows in any case that there exist experiments by which one can measure the state of one particle and instantaneously change the state of its entangled partner  although the two particles can be an arbitrary distance apart  however  this effect does not violate causality  since no transfer of information happens  Quantum entanglement is at the basis of quantum cryptography  with high security commercial applications in banking and government  Gravity is negligible in many areas of particle physics  so that unification between general relativity and quantum mechanics is not an urgent issue in those applications  However  the lack of a correct theory of quantum gravity is an important issue in cosmology and physicists  search for an elegant  theory of everything   Thus  resolving the inconsistencies between both theories has been a major goal of twentieth  and twenty first century physics  Many prominent physicists  including Stephen Hawking  have labored in the attempt to discover a theory underlying everything  combining not only different models of subatomic physics  but also deriving the universe s four forces  the strong force  electromagnetism  weak force  and gravity  from a single force or phenomenon  While Stephen Hawking was initially a believer in the Theory of Everything  after considering G del s Incompleteness Theorem  concluded that one was not obtainable  and stated such publicly in his lecture   G del and the end of physics  in 2002  36  One of the leaders in this field is Edward Witten  a theoretical physicist who formulated the groundbreaking M theory  which is an attempt at describing the supersymmetrical based string theory  Attempts at a unified field theory Main article  Grand unified theory The quest to unify the fundamental forces through quantum mechanics is still ongoing  Quantum electrodynamics  or  quantum electromagnetism    which is currently  in the perturbative regime at least  the most accurately tested physical theory  37  unreliable source  blog  has been successfully merged with the weak nuclear force into the electroweak force and work is currently being done to merge the electroweak and strong force into the electrostrong force  Current predictions state that at around 1014 GeV the three aforementioned forces are fused into a single unified field  38  Beyond this  grand unification   it is speculated that it may be possible to merge gravity with the other three gauge symmetries  expected to occur at roughly 1019 GeV  However   and while special relativity is parsimoniously incorporated into quantum electrodynamics   the expanded general relativity  currently the best theory describing the gravitation force  has not been fully incorporated into quantum theory  Philosophical implications Main article  Interpretations of quantum mechanics Since its inception  the many counter intuitive results of quantum mechanics have provoked strong philosophical debate and many interpretations  Even fundamental issues such as Max Born s basic rules concerning probability amplitudes and probability distributions took decades to be appreciated by the society and leading scientists  Richard Feynman said   I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics   39  The Copenhagen interpretation  due largely to the Danish theoretical physicist Niels Bohr  is the interpretation of the quantum mechanical formalism most widely accepted amongst physicists  According to it  the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is not a temporary feature which will eventually be replaced by a deterministic theory  but instead must be considered to be a final renunciation of the classical ideal of causality  In this interpretation  it is believed that any well defined application of the quantum mechanical formalism must always make reference to the experimental arrangement  due to the complementarity nature of evidence obtained under different experimental situations  Albert Einstein  himself one of the founders of quantum theory  disliked this loss of determinism in measurement   A view paraphrased as  God does not play dice with the universe    Einstein held that there should be a local hidden variable theory underlying quantum mechanics and that  consequently  the present theory was incomplete  He produced a series of objections to the theory  the most famous of which has become known as the Einstein Podolsky Rosen paradox  John Bell showed that the EPR paradox led to experimentally testable differences between quantum mechanics and local realistic theories  Experiments have been performed confirming the accuracy of quantum mechanics  thus demonstrating that the physical world cannot be described by local realistic theories  40  The Bohr Einstein debates provide a vibrant critique of the Copenhagen Interpretation from an epistemological point of view  The Everett many worlds interpretation  formulated in 1956  holds that all the possibilities described by quantum theory simultaneously occur in a multiverse composed of mostly independent parallel universes  41  This is not accomplished by introducing some new axiom to quantum mechanics  but on the contrary by removing the axiom of the collapse of the wave packet  All the possible consistent states of the measured system and the measuring apparatus  including the observer  are present in a real physical  not just formally mathematical  as in other interpretations  quantum superposition  Such a superposition of consistent state combinations of different systems is called an entangled state  While the multiverse is deterministic  we perceive non deterministic behavior governed by probabilities  because we can observe only the universe  i e  the consistent state contribution to the mentioned superposition  we inhabit  Everett s interpretation is perfectly consistent with John Bell s experiments and makes them intuitively understandable  However  according to the theory of quantum decoherence  the parallel universes will never be accessible to us  This inaccessibility can be understood as follows  Once a measurement is done  the measured system becomes entangled with both the physicist who measured it and a huge number of other particles  some of which are photons flying away towards the other end of the universe  in order to prove that the wave function did not collapse one would have to bring all these particles back and measure them again  together with the system that was measured originally  This is completely impractical  but even if one could theoretically do this  it would destroy any evidence that the original measurement took place  including the physicist s memory   citation needed  Applications Quantum mechanics had enormous 42  success in explaining many of the features of our world  The individual behaviour of the subatomic particles that make up all forms of matter electrons  protons  neutrons  photons and others can often only be satisfactorily described using quantum mechanics  Quantum mechanics has strongly influenced the string theory  a candidate for a theory of everything  see reductionism  and the multiverse hypothesis  Quantum mechanics is important for understanding how individual atoms combine covalently to form chemicals or molecules  The application of quantum mechanics to chemistry is known as quantum chemistry   Relativistic  quantum mechanics can in principle mathematically describe most of chemistry  Quantum mechanics can provide quantitative insight into ionic and covalent bonding processes by explicitly showing which molecules are energetically favorable to which others  and by approximately how much  43  Most of the calculations performed in computational chemistry rely on quantum mechanics  44  A working mechanism of a resonant tunneling diode device  based on the phenomenon of quantum tunneling through the potential barriers  Much of modern technology operates at a scale where quantum effects are significant  Examples include the laser  the transistor  and thus the microchip   the electron microscope  and magnetic resonance imaging  The study of semiconductors led to the invention of the diode and the transistor  which are indispensable for modern electronics  Researchers are currently seeking robust methods of directly manipulating quantum states  Efforts are being made to develop quantum cryptography  which will allow guaranteed secure transmission of information  A more distant goal is the development of quantum computers  which are expected to perform certain computational tasks exponentially faster than classical computers  Another active research topic is quantum teleportation  which deals with techniques to transmit quantum information over arbitrary distances  Quantum tunneling is vital in many devices  even in the simple light switch  as otherwise the electrons in the electric current could not penetrate the potential barrier made up of a layer of oxide  Flash memory chips found in USB drives use quantum tunneling to erase their memory cells  Quantum mechanics primarily applies to the atomic regimes of matter and energy  but some systems exhibit quantum mechanical effects on a large scale  superfluidity  the frictionless flow of a liquid at temperatures near absolute zero  is one well known example  Quantum theory also provides accurate descriptions for many previously unexplained phenomena such as black body radiation and the stability of electron orbitals  It has also given insight into the workings of many different biological systems  including smell receptors and protein structures  45  Recent work on photosynthesis has provided evidence that quantum correlations play an essential role in this most fundamental process of the plant kingdom  46  Even so  classical physics often can be a good approximation to results otherwise obtained by quantum physics  typically in circumstances with large numbers of particles or large quantum numbers  Examples Free particle For example  consider a free particle  In quantum mechanics  there is wave particle duality so the properties of the particle can be described as the properties of a wave  Therefore  its quantum state can be represented as a wave of arbitrary shape and extending over space as a wave function  The position and momentum of the particle are observables  The Uncertainty Principle states that both the position and the momentum cannot simultaneously be measured with full precision at the same time  However  one can measure the position alone of a moving free particle creating an eigenstate of position with a wavefunction that is very large  a Dirac delta  at a particular position x and zero everywhere else  If one performs a position measurement on such a wavefunction  the result x will be obtained with 100  probability  full certainty   This is called an eigenstate of position  mathematically more precise  a generalized position eigenstate  eigendistribution    If the particle is in an eigenstate of position then its momentum is completely unknown  On the other hand  if the particle is in an eigenstate of momentum then its position is completely unknown  47  In an eigenstate of momentum having a plane wave form  it can be shown that the wavelength is equal to h p  where h is Planck s constant and p is the momentum of the eigenstate  48  3D confined electron wave functions for each eigenstate in a Quantum Dot  Here  rectangular and triangular shaped quantum dots are shown  Energy states in rectangular dots are more  s type  and  p type   However  in a triangular dot the wave functions are mixed due to confinement symmetry  Step potential Main article  Solution of Schr dinger equation for a step potential Scattering at a finite potential step of height V0  shown in green  The amplitudes and direction of left and right moving waves are indicated  Yellow is the incident wave  blue are reflected and transmitted  red does not occur  E  gt  V0 for this figure  The potential in this case is given by  The solutions are superpositions of left and right moving waves    where the wave vectors are related to the energy via   and and the coefficients A and B are determined from the boundary conditions and by imposing a continuous derivative to the solution  Each term of the solution can be interpreted as an incident  reflected or transmitted component of the wave  allowing the calculation of transmission and reflection coefficients  In contrast to classical mechanics  incident particles with energies higher than the size of the potential step are still partially reflected  Rectangular potential barrier Main article  Rectangular potential barrier This is a model for the quantum tunneling effect  which has important applications to modern devices such as flash memory and the scanning tunneling microscope  Particle in a box 1 dimensional potential energy box  or infinite potential well  Main article  Particle in a box The particle in a 1 dimensional potential energy box is the most simple example where restraints lead to the quantization of energy levels  The box is defined as having zero potential energy inside a certain region and infinite potential energy everywhere outside that region  For the 1 dimensional case in the direction  the time independent Schr dinger equation can be written as  49  Writing the differential operator the previous equation can be seen to be evocative of the classic analogue with as the energy for the state   in this case coinciding with the kinetic energy of the particle  The general solutions of the Schr dinger equation for the particle in a box are  or  from Euler s formula  The presence of the walls of the box determines the values of C  D  and k  At each wall  x   0 and x   L       0  Thus when x   0  and so D   0  When x   L  C cannot be zero  since this would conflict with the Born interpretation  Therefore sin kL   0  and so it must be that kL is an integer multiple of    Therefore  The quantization of energy levels follows from this constraint on k  since Finite potential well Main article  Finite potential well This is generalization of the infinite potential well problem to potential wells of finite depth  Harmonic oscillator Main article  Quantum harmonic oscillator Some trajectories of a harmonic oscillator  a ball attached to a spring  in classical mechanics  A B  and quantum mechanics  C H   In quantum mechanics  the position of the ball is represented by a wave  called the wavefunction   with real part shown in blue and imaginary part in red  Some of the trajectories  such as C D E F  are standing waves  or  stationary states    Each standing wave frequency is proportional to a possible energy level of the oscillator  This  energy quantization  does not occur in classical physics  where the oscillator can have any energy  As in the classical case  the potential for the quantum harmonic oscillator is given by  This problem can be solved either by solving the Schr dinger equation directly  which is not trivial  or by using the more elegant ladder method  first proposed by Paul Dirac  The eigenstates are given by  where Hn are the Hermite polynomials  and the corresponding energy levels are   This is another example which illustrates the quantization of energy for bound states  Notes   The angular momentum of an unbound electron is not quantized    J  Mehra and H  Rechenberg  The historical development of
