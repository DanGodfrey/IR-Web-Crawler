Valparaiso Seringapatam Munity Action of 9 May 1814 The War of 1812 was a military conflict fought between the forces of the United States of America and those of the British Empire  The Americans declared war in 1812 for several reasons  including trade restrictions due to Britain s ongoing war with France  the impressment of American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy  British support of American Indian tribes against American expansion  outrage over insults to national honour after humiliations on the high seas and possible American desire to annex Canada  3   Tied down in Europe until 1814  the British at first used defensive strategy  repelling multiple American invasions of the provinces of Upper and Lower Canada  However  the Americans gained control over Lake Erie in 1813  seized parts of western Ontario  and ended the prospect of an Indian confederacy and an independent Indian state in the Midwest under British sponsorship  In the Southwest  General Andrew Jackson destroyed the military strength of the Creek nation at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814  With the defeat of Napoleon in 1814  the British adopted a more aggressive strategy  sending in three large invasion armies  The British victory at the Battle of Bladensburg in August 1814 allowed them to capture and burn Washington  D C  American victories in September 1814 and January 1815 repulsed all three British invasions in New York  Baltimore and New Orleans  The war was fought in three theatres  At sea  warships and privateers of both sides attacked each other s merchant ships  The British blockaded the Atlantic coast of the U S  and mounted large scale raids in the later stages of the war  American successes at sea were characterized by single ship duels against British frigates  and combat against British provincial vessels on the Great Lakes  such as at the action on Lake Erie  Both land and naval battles were fought on the frontier  which ran along the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River  The South and the Gulf coast saw major land battles in which the American forces destroyed Britain s Indian allies and repulsed the main British invasion force at New Orleans  Both sides invaded each other s territory  but these invasions were unsuccessful or temporary  At the end of the war  both sides occupied parts of the other s territory  but these areas were restored by the Treaty of Ghent  In the United States  battles such as the Battle of New Orleans of 1815 and the Battle of Baltimore of 1814  which inspired the lyrics of the United States national anthem   The Star Spangled Banner   produced a sense of euphoria over a  second war of independence  against Britain  It ushered in an  Era of Good Feelings  in which partisan animosity nearly vanished  Canada also emerged from the war with a heightened sense of national feeling and solidarity  having repelled multiple American invasions  Battles such as the Battle of Queenston Heights and the Battle of Crysler s Farm were used as such examples by Canadians  The war is scarcely remembered in Britain today  as it regarded the war as a sideshow to the much larger war against Napoleon raging in Europe  as such it welcomed an era of peaceful relations and trade with the United States  Contents 1 Reasons for the war 1 1 Trade with France 1 2 Impressment 1 3 British support for Indian raids 1 4

References 12 Further reading 13 External links Reasons for the war Main article  Origins of the War of 1812 The United States declared war on Britain for several reasons  As Risjord  1961  notes  an unstated but powerful motivation for the Americans was the desire to uphold national honour in the face of what they considered to be British insults  including the Chesapeake affair   4  Trade with France In 1807  Britain introduced a series of trade restrictions via a series of Orders in Council to impede American trade with France  with which Britain was at war  The United States contested these restrictions as illegal under international law  5  The British wanted to impede American trade with France  regardless of their theoretical right as neutrals to do so  As author Reginald Horsman explains   a large section of influential British opinion  both in the government and in the country  thought that America presented a threat to British maritime supremacy   6  The American merchant marine had come close to doubling between 1802 and 1810  making it by far the largest neutral fleet  Britain was the largest trading partner  receiving 80  of U S  cotton and 50  of other U S  exports  The British public and press were resentful of the growing mercantile and commercial competition  7  The United States  view was that Britain s restrictions violated its right to trade with others  Impressment During the Napoleonic Wars  the Royal Navy expanded to 175 ships of the line and 600 ships overall  requiring 140 000 sailors to man  8  While the Royal Navy could man its ships with volunteers in peacetime  it competed in wartime with merchant shipping and privateers for a small pool of experienced sailors and turned to impressment when it could not operate ships with volunteers alone  Britain did not recognize the right of a British subject to relinquish his status as a British subject  emigrate and transfer his national allegiance as a naturalized citizen to any other country  Thus while the United States recognized British born sailors on American ships as Americans  Britain did not  It was estimated that there were 11 000 naturalized sailors on United States ships in 1805  Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin stated that 9 000 were born in Britain  9  The Royal Navy went after them by intercepting and searching U S  merchant ships for deserters  Impressment actions such as the Leander Affair and the Chesapeake Leopard Affair outraged Americans  because they infringed on national sovereignty and denied America s ability to naturalize foreigners  10  Moreover  a great number of British sailors serving as naturalized Americans on U S  ships were  in fact  Irish  An investigation by Captain Isaac Chauncey in 1808 found that 58  of the sailors based in New York City were either naturalized citizens or recent immigrants  the majority of foreign sailors  134 of 150  being from Britain  Moreover  eighty of the 134 British sailors were Irish   Alan Taylor  The Civil War of 1812  p  104   The United States believed that British deserters had a right to become United States citizens  Britain did not recognize naturalized United States citizenship  so in addition to recovering deserters  it considered United States citizens born British liable for impressment  Aggravating the situation was the widespread use of forged identity papers by sailors  This made it all the more difficult for the Royal Navy to distinguish Americans from non Americans and led it to impress some Americans who had never been British   Some gained freedom on appeal   11  American anger at impressment grew when British frigates stationed themselves just outside U S  harbours in view of U S  shores and searched ships for contraband and impressed men in U S  territorial waters  12   Free trade and sailors  rights  was a rallying cry for the United States throughout the conflict  British support for Indian raids Origins of the War of 1812 Chesapeake Leopard Affair Orders in Council  1807  Embargo Act of 1807 Non Intercourse Act  1809  Macon s Bill Number 2 Tecumseh s War Henry letters War Hawks Rule of 1756 Monroe Pinkney Treaty Little Belt Affair The Northwest Territory  comprising the modern states of Ohio  Indiana  Illinois  Michigan  and Wisconsin  had been an area of dispute between the Indian Nations and the United States since the passage of the Northwest Ordinance in 1787  13  The British Empire had ceded the area to the United States in the Treaty of Paris in 1783  The Indian Nations followed Tenskwatawa  the Shawnee Prophet and the brother of Tecumseh  Tenskwatawa had a vision of purifying his society by expelling the  children of the Evil Spirit   the American settlers  14  Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh formed a confederation of numerous tribes to block American expansion  The British saw the Indian nations as valuable allies and a buffer to its Canadian colonies and provided arms  Attacks on American settlers in the Northwest further aggravated tensions between Britain and the United States  15  The Confederation s raids hindered American expansion into potentially valuable farmlands in the Northwest Territory  16  The British had the long standing goal of creating a large  neutral  Indian state that would cover much of Ohio  Indiana  and Michigan  They made the demand as late as the fall of 1814 at the peace conference  but lost control of western Ontario at key battles on Lake Erie  thus giving the Americans control of the proposed neutral zone  17  18  American Expansionism American expansion into the Northwest Territory was being obstructed by indigenous leaders like Tecumseh  who were supplied and encouraged by the British  Americans on the western frontier demanded that interference be stopped  19  Before 1940  some historians 20  21  held that United States expansionism into Canada was also a reason for the war  however  one subsequent historian wrote   Almost all accounts of the 1811 1812 period have stressed the influence of a youthful band  denominated War Hawks  on Madison s policy  According to the standard picture  these men were a rather wild and exuberant group enraged by Britain s maritime practices  certain that the British were encouraging the Indians and convinced that Canada would be an easy conquest and a choice addition to the national domain  Like all stereotypes  there is some truth in this tableau  however  inaccuracies predominate  First  Perkins has shown that those favoring war were older than those opposed  Second  the lure of the Canadas has been played down by most recent investigators   22  Some Canadian historians proposed the notion in the early 20th century  23  and it survives in public opinion in Ontario  According to Stagg  1981  and Stagg  1983   Madison and his advisers believed that conquest of Canada would be easy and that economic coercion would force the British to come to terms by cutting off the food supply for their West Indies colonies  Furthermore  possession of Canada would be a valuable bargaining chip  Settlers demanded the seizure of Canada not because they wanted the land  but because the British were thought to be arming the Indians and thereby blocking US settlement of the West  24  25  As Horsman concluded   The idea of conquering Canada had been present since at least 1807 as a means of forcing England to change her policy at sea  The conquest of Canada was primarily a means of waging war  not a reason for starting it   26  Hickey flatly stated   The desire to annex Canada did not bring on the war   27  Brown  1964  concluded   The purpose of the Canadian expedition was to serve negotiation  not to annex Canada   28  Burt  a leading Canadian scholar  agreed  noting that Foster the British minister to Washington also rejected the argument that annexation of Canada was a war goal  29  However  J  C  A  Stagg states that      had the War 1812 been a successful military venture  the Madison administration would have been reluctant to have returned occupied Canadian territory to the enemy    3  Most inhabitants of Upper Canada  Ontario  were either Revolutionary era exiles from the United States  United Empire Loyalists  or postwar American immigrants  The Loyalists were hostile to union with the United States  while the other settlers were uninterested  The Canadian colonies were thinly populated and only lightly defended by the British Army  Americans then believed that many in Upper Canada would rise up and greet a United States invading army as liberators  which did not happen  One reason American forces retreated after one successful battle inside Canada was that they could not obtain supplies from the locals  30  But the Americans thought that the possibility of local support suggested an easy conquest  as former President Thomas Jefferson believed   The acquisition of Canada this year  as far as the neighborhood of Quebec  will be a mere matter of marching  and will give us the experience for the attack on Halifax  the next and final expulsion of England from the American continent   Some British officials   and some dissident Americans   charged that the goal of the war was to annex part of Canada  but they did not specify which part  The states nearest Canada strongly opposed the war  31  US political conflict While the British government was largely oblivious to the deteriorating North American situation  due to its involvement in a continent wide European War  the US was in a period of significant political conflict between the Federalist Party  based mainly in the Northeast   which favoured a strong central government and closer ties to Britain  and the Democratic Republican Party  with its greatest power base in the South and West   which favoured a weak central government  preservation of slavery  expansion into Indian land  and a stronger break with Britain  By 1812  the Federalist Party had weakened considerably  and the Democratic Republicans  with James Madison completing his first term of office and control of Congress  was in a very strong position to pursue its more aggressive agenda against Britain and attempt to further weaken its Federalist rivals  32  Throughout the war  support for the US cause would be weak  or sometimes non existent  in Federalist areas of the Northeast  though after the war  the self destruction of the Federalists at the Hartford Convention led to broader  retroactive support from all parts of the country  Declaration of war On June 1  1812  President James Madison sent a message to the Congress recounting American grievances against Great Britain  though not specifically calling for a declaration of war  After Madison s message  the House of Representatives deliberated for four days behind closed doors before voting  79 to 49  the first declaration of war  and the Senate agreed by 19 to 13  The conflict began formally on June 18  1812  when Madison signed the measure into law  This was the first time that the United States had declared war on another nation  and the Congressional vote would prove to be the closest vote to declare war in American history  None of the 39 Federalists in Congress voted in favour of the war  critics of war subsequently referred to it as  Mr  Madison s War    33  Meanwhile in London on May 11  an assassin killed Prime Minister Spencer Perceval  which resulted in Lord Liverpool coming to power  Liverpool wanted a more practical relationship with the United States  He issued a repeal of the Orders in Council  but the United States was unaware of this  as it took three weeks for the news to cross the Atlantic  34  Course of the war Although the outbreak of the war had been preceded by years of angry diplomatic dispute  neither side was ready for war when it came  Britain was heavily engaged in the Napoleonic Wars  most of the British Army was deployed in the Peninsular War  in Spain   and the Royal Navy was compelled to blockade most of the coast of Europe  The number of British regular troops present in Canada in July 1812 was officially stated to be 6 034  supported by Canadian militia  35  Throughout the war  the British Secretary of State for War and the Colonies was the Earl of Bathurst  For the first two years of the war  he could spare few troops to reinforce North America and urged the commander in chief in North America  Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost  to maintain a defensive strategy  The naturally cautious Prevost followed these instructions  concentrating on defending Lower Canada at the expense of Upper Canada  which was more vulnerable to American attacks  and allowing few offensive actions  The United States was not prepared to prosecute a war  for Madison had assumed that the state militias would easily seize Canada and that negotiations would follow  In 1812  the regular army consisted of fewer than 12 000 men  Congress authorized the expansion of the army to 35 000 men  but the service was voluntary and unpopular  it offered poor pay  and there were few trained and experienced officers  at least initially  36  The militia objected to serving outside their home states  were not open to discipline  and performed poorly against British forces when outside their home states  American prosecution of the war suffered from its unpopularity  especially in New England  where anti war speakers were vocal   Two of the Massachusetts members  of Congress   Seaver and Widgery  were publicly insulted and hissed on Change in Boston  while another  Charles Turner  member for the Plymouth district  and Chief Justice of the Court of Sessions for that county  was seized by a crowd on the evening of August 3   1812  and kicked through the town   37  The United States had great difficulty financing its war  It had disbanded its national bank  and private bankers in the Northeast were opposed to the war  The failure of New England to provide militia units or financial support was a serious blow  38  Threats of secession by New England states were loud  as evidenced by the Hartford Convention  Britain exploited these divisions  blockading only southern ports for much of the war and encouraging smuggling  39  On July 12  1812  General William Hull led an invading American force of about 1 000 untrained  poorly equipped militia across the Detroit River and occupied the Canadian town of Sandwich  now a neighbourhood of Windsor  Ontario   By August  Hull and his troops  numbering 2 500 with the addition of 500 Canadians  retreated to Detroit  where they surrendered to a force of British regulars  Canadian militia and Native Americans  led by British Major General Isaac Brock and Shawnee leader Tecumseh  40  The surrender not only cost the United States the village of Detroit  but control over most of the Michigan territory  Several months later  the U S  launched a second invasion of Canada  this time at the Niagara peninsula  On October 13  United States forces were again defeated at the Battle of Queenston Heights  where General Brock was killed  41  Military and civilian leadership remained a critical American weakness until 1814  The early disasters brought about chiefly by American unpreparedness and lack of leadership drove United States Secretary of War William Eustis from office  His successor  John Armstrong  Jr   attempted a coordinated strategy late in 1813  with 10 000 men  aimed at the capture of Montreal  but he was thwarted by logistical difficulties  uncooperative and quarrelsome commanders and ill trained troops  After losing several battles to inferior forces  the Americans retreated in disarray in October 1813  42  A decisive use of naval power came on the Great Lakes and depended on a contest of building ships  The U S  started a rapidly expanded program of building warships at Sackets Harbor on Lake Ontario  where 3 000 men were recruited  many from New York City  to build 11 warships early in the war  In 1813  the Americans won control of Lake Erie in the Battle of Lake Erie and cut off British and Native American forces in the west from their supply base  they were decisively defeated by General William Henry Harrison s forces on their retreat towards Niagara at the Battle of the Thames in October 1813  43  Tecumseh  the leader of the tribal confederation  was killed and his Indian coalition disintegrated  44  While some Natives continued to fight alongside British troops  they subsequently did so only as individual tribes or groups of warriors  and where they were directly supplied and armed by British agents  The Americans controlled western Ontario  and permanently ended the threat of Indian raids based in Canada into the American Midwest  thus achieving a basic war goal  45  46  Control of Lake Ontario changed hands several times  with both sides unable and unwilling to take advantage of the temporary superiority  At sea  the powerful Royal Navy blockaded much of the coastline  though it was allowing substantial exports from New England  which traded with Canada in defiance of American laws  The blockade devastated American agricultural exports  but it helped stimulate local factories that replaced goods previously imported  The American strategy of using small gunboats to defend ports was a fiasco  as the British raided the coast at will  The most famous episode was a series of British raids on the shores of Chesapeake Bay  including an attack on Washington that resulted in the British burning of the White House  the Capitol  the Navy Yard  and other public buildings  in the  Burning of Washington   The embarrassing Burning of Washington led to Armstrong s dismissal as US Secretary of War  The British power at sea was enough to allow the Royal Navy to levy  contributions  on bayside towns in return for not burning them to the ground  The Americans were more successful in ship to ship actions  They sent out several hundred privateers to attack British merchant ships  in the first four months of war they captured 219 British merchant ships  47  British commercial interests were damaged  especially in the West Indies  48  After Napoleon abdicated in 1814  the British could send veteran armies to the United States  but by then the Americans had learned how to mobilize and fight  49  British General Prevost launched a major invasion of New York State with these veteran soldiers  but the American fleet under Thomas Macdonough gained control of Lake Champlain and the British lost the Battle of Plattsburgh in September 1814  Prevost  blamed for the defeat  sought a court martial to clear his name  but he died in London awaiting it  50  A British invasion of Louisiana  unknowingly launched after the Treaty of Ghent was negotiated to end the war  was defeated with very heavy British losses by General Andrew Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815  The victory made Jackson a national hero  restored the American sense of honour  51  and ruined the Federalist party efforts to condemn the war as a failure  52  53  With the ratification of the peace treaty in February 1815  the war ended before the U S  new Secretary of War James Monroe could put his new offensive strategy into effect  Once Britain and The Sixth Coalition defeated Napoleon in 1814  France and Britain became allies  Britain ended the trade restrictions and the impressment of American sailors  thus removing two more causes of the war  After two years of warfare  the major causes of the war had disappeared  Neither side had a reason to continue or a chance of gaining a decisive success that would compel their opponents to cede territory or advantageous peace terms  54  As a result of this stalemate  the two countries signed the Treaty of Ghent on December 24  1814  News of the peace treaty took two months to reach the U S   during which fighting continued  The war fostered a spirit of national unity and an  Era of Good Feelings  in the U S   55  as well as in Canada  56  It opened a long era of peaceful relations between the United States and the British Empire  57  Theatres of war The war was conducted in three theatres  The Atlantic Ocean The Great Lakes and the Canadian frontier The Southern States Atlantic theatre Single ship actions Map of USS Chesapeake during War of 1812 In 1812  Britain s Royal Navy was the world s largest  with over 600 cruisers in commission and some smaller vessels  Although most of these were involved in blockading the French navy and protecting British trade against  usually French  privateers  the Royal Navy nevertheless had 85 vessels in American waters  if all British Navy vessels in North American and the Caribbean are counted  58  However the Royal Navy s North American squadron based in Halifax  Nova Scotia which bore the brunt of the war  numbered one small ship of the line  seven frigates  nine smaller sloops and brigs along with five schooners  59  By contrast  the United States Navy comprised 8 frigates  14 smaller sloops and brigs  and no ships of the line  However some American frigates were exceptionally large and powerful for their class  larger than any British frigate in North America  Whereas the standard British frigate of the time was rated as a 38 gun ship  with its main battery consisting of 18 pounder guns  the USS Constitution  USS President  and USS United States were rated as 44 gun ships and carried 56 guns with a main battery of 24 pounders  60  USS Constitution defeats HMS Guerriere  a significant event during the war  The British strategy was to protect their own merchant shipping to and from Halifax  Canada and the West Indies  and to enforce a blockade of major American ports to restrict American trade  Because of their numerical inferiority  the Americans aimed to cause disruption through hit and run tactics  such as the capture of prizes and engaging Royal Navy vessels only under favourable circumstances  Days after the formal declaration of war  however  two small squadrons sailed  including the frigate USS President and the sloop USS Hornet under Commodore John Rodgers  and the frigates USS United States and USS Congress  with the brig USS Argus under Captain Stephen Decatur  These were initially concentrated as one unit under Rodgers  and it was his intention to force the Royal Navy to concentrate its own ships to prevent isolated units being captured by his powerful force  Large numbers of American merchant ships were still returning to the United States  and if the Royal Navy was concentrated  it could not watch all the ports on the American seaboard  Rodgers  strategy worked  in that the Royal Navy concentrated most of its frigates off New York Harbor under Captain Philip Broke and allowed many American ships to reach home  However  his own cruise captured only five small merchant ships  and the Americans never subsequently concentrated more than two or three ships together as a unit  Meanwhile  the USS Constitution  commanded by Captain Isaac Hull  sailed from Chesapeake Bay on July 12  On July 17  Broke s British squadron gave chase off New York  but the Constitution evaded her pursuers after two days  After briefly calling at Boston to replenish water  on August 19  the Constitution engaged the British frigate HMS Guerriere  After a 35 minute battle  Guerriere had been dis masted and captured and was later burned  The Constitution earned the nickname  Old Ironsides  following this battle as many of the British cannon balls were seen to bounce off her hull  Hull returned to Boston with news of this significant victory  On October 25  the USS United States  commanded by Captain Decatur  captured the British frigate HMS Macedonian  which he then carried back to port  61  At the close of the month  the Constitution sailed south  now under the command of Captain William Bainbridge  On December 29  off Bahia  Brazil  she met the British frigate HMS Java  After a battle lasting three hours  Java struck her colours and was burned after being judged unsalvageable  The USS Constitution  however  was relatively undamaged in the battle  The successes gained by the three big American frigates forced Britain to construct five 40 gun  24 pounder heavy frigates 62  and two  spar decked  frigates  the 60 gun HMS Leander and HMS Newcastle 63   and to razee three old 74 gun ships of the line to convert them to heavy frigates  64  The Royal Navy acknowledged that there were factors other than greater size and heavier guns  The United States Navy s sloops and brigs had also won several victories over Royal Navy vessels of approximately equal strength  While the American ships had experienced and well drilled volunteer crews  the enormous size of the overstretched Royal Navy meant that many ships were shorthanded and the average quality of crews suffered  and constant sea duties of those serving in North America interfered with their training and exercises  65  HMS Shannon leading the captured American frigate USS Chesapeake into Halifax  Nova Scotia  1813  The capture of the three British frigates stimulated the British to greater exertions  More vessels were deployed on the American seaboard and the blockade tightened  On June 1  1813  off Boston Harbor  the frigate USS Chesapeake  commanded by Captain James Lawrence  was captured by the British frigate HMS Shannon under Captain Sir Philip Broke  Lawrence was mortally wounded and famously cried out   Don t give up the ship  Hold on  men   65  Although the Chesapeake was only of equal strength to the average British frigate and the crew had mustered together only hours before the battle  the British press reacted with almost hysterical relief that the run of American victories had ended  66  It should be noted that this single victory was by ratio one of the bloodiest contests recorded during this age of sail with more dead and wounded than HMS Victory suffered in 4 hours of combat at Trafalgar  Captain Lawrence was killed and Captain Broke would never again hold a sea command due to wounds  67  In January 1813  the American frigate USS Essex  under the command of Captain David Porter  sailed into the Pacific in an attempt to harass British shipping  Many British whaling ships carried letters of marque allowing them to prey on American whalers  and nearly destroyed the industry  The Essex challenged this practice  She inflicted considerable damage on British interests before she was captured off Valparaiso  Chile by the British frigate HMS Phoebe and the sloop HMS Cherub on March 28  1814  68  The British 6th rate Cruizer class brig sloops did not fare well against the American ship rigged sloops of war  The USS Hornet and USS Wasp constructed before the war were notably powerful vessels  and the Frolic class built during the war even more so  although USS Frolic was trapped and captured by a British frigate and a schooner   The British brig rigged sloops tended to suffer fire to their rigging far worse than the American ship rigged sloops  while the ship rigged sloops could back their sails in action  giving them another advantage in manoeuvring  69  Following their earlier losses  the British Admiralty instituted a new policy that the three American heavy frigates should not be engaged except by a ship of the line or smaller vessels in squadron strength  An example of this was the capture of the USS President by a squadron of four British frigates in January 1815  A month later  however  the USS Constitution managed to engage and capture two smaller British warships  HMS Cyane and HMS Levant  sailing in company  70  Blockade The blockade of American ports later tightened to the extent that most American merchant ships and naval vessels were confined to port  The American frigates USS United States and USS Macedonian ended the war blockaded and hulked in New London  Connecticut  Some merchant ships were based in Europe or Asia and continued operations  Others  mainly from New England  were issued licences to trade by Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren  commander in chief on the American station in 1813  This allowed Wellington s army in Spain to receive American goods and to maintain the New Englanders  opposition to the war  The blockade nevertheless resulted in American exports decreasing from  130 million in 1807 to  7 million in 1814  71  The operations of American privateers  some of which belonged to the United States Navy  but most of which were private ventures  were extensive  They continued until the close of the war and were only partially affected by the strict enforcement of convoy by the Royal Navy  An example of the audacity of the American cruisers was the depredations in British home waters carried out by the American sloop USS Argus  It was eventually captured off St  David s Head in Wales by the British brig HMS Pelican on August 14  1813  A total of 1 554 vessels were claimed captured by all American naval and privateer vessels  1 300 of which were captured by privateers  72  73  74  However  insurer Lloyd s of London reported that only 1 175 British ships were taken  373 of which were recaptured  for a total loss of 802  75  As the Royal Navy base that supervised the blockade  Halifax profited greatly during the war  From that base British privateers seized many French and American ships and sold their prizes in Halifax  The war was the last time the British allowed privateering  since the practice was coming to be seen as politically inexpedient and of diminishing value in maintaining its naval supremacy  It was the swan song of Bermuda s privateers  who had vigorously returned to the practice after American lawsuits had put a stop to it two decades earlier  The nimble Bermuda sloops captured 298 enemy ships  British naval and privateer vessels between the Great Lakes and the West Indies captured 1 593  76  Atlantic coast Preoccupied in their pursuit of American privateers when the war began  the British naval forces had some difficulty in blockading the entire U S  coast  The British government  having need of American foodstuffs for its army in Spain  benefited from the willingness of the New Englanders to trade with them  so no blockade of New England was at first attempted  The Delaware River and Chesapeake Bay were declared in a state of blockade on December 26  1812  This was extended to the coast south of Narragansett by November 1813 and to the entire American coast on May 31  1814  In the meantime  illicit trade was carried on by collusive captures arranged between American traders and British officers  American ships were fraudulently transferred to neutral flags  Eventually  the U S  government was driven to issue orders to stop illicit trading  this put only a further strain on the commerce of the country  The overpowering strength of the British fleet enabled it to occupy the Chesapeake and to attack and destroy numerous docks and harbours  Additionally  commanders of the blockading fleet  based at the Bermuda dockyard  were given instructions to encourage the defection of American slaves by offering freedom  as they did during the Revolutionary War  Thousands of black slaves went over to the Crown with their families and were recruited into the 3rd  Colonial  Battalion of the Royal Marines on occupied Tangier Island  in the Chesapeake  A further company of colonial marines was raised at the Bermuda dockyard  where many freed slaves men  women  and children had been given refuge and employment  It was kept as a defensive force in case of an attack  These former slaves fought for Britain throughout the Atlantic campaign  including the attack on Washington  D C  and the Louisiana Campaign  and most were later re enlisted into British West India regiments or settled in Trinidad in August 1816  where seven hundred of these ex marines were granted land  they reportedly organized in villages along the lines of military companies   Many other freed American slaves were recruited directly into West Indian regiments or newly created British Army units  A few thousand freed slaves were later settled at Nova Scotia by the British  Maine Maine  then part of Massachusetts  was a base for smuggling and illegal trade between the U S  and the British  Until 1813 the region was generally quiet except for privateer actions near the coast  In September  1813  there was a notable naval action when the U S  Navy s brig Enterprise fought and captured the Royal Navy brig Boxer off Pemaquid Point  77  The first British assault came in July  1814  when Sir Thomas Masterman Hardy took Moose Island  Eastport  Maine  without a shot  with the entire American garrison of Fort Sullivan surrendering  78  Next  from his base in Halifax  Nova Scotia  in September 1814  Sir John Coape Sherbrooke led 500 British troops in the  Penobscot Expedition   In 26 days  he raided and looted Hampden  Bangor  and Machias  destroying or capturing 17 American ships  He won the Battle of Hampden  losing two killed while the Americans lost one killed  and occupied the village of Castine for the rest of the war  The Treaty of Ghent returned this territory to the United States  The British left in April 1815  at which time they took 10 750 pounds obtained from tariff duties at Castine  This money  called the  Castine Fund   was used in the establishment of Dalhousie University  in Halifax  Nova Scotia  79  Chesapeake campaign and  The Star Spangled Banner  The strategic location of the Chesapeake Bay near America s capital made it a prime target for the British  Starting in March 1813  a squadron under Rear Admiral George Cockburn started a blockade of the bay and raided towns along the bay from Norfolk to Havre de Grace  On July 4  1813  Joshua Barney  a Revolutionary War naval hero  convinced the Navy Department to build the Chesapeake Bay Flotilla  a squadron of twenty barges to defend the Chesapeake Bay  Launched in April 1814  the squadron was quickly cornered in the Patuxent River  and while successful in harassing the Royal Navy  they were powerless to stop the British campaign that ultimately led to the  Burning of Washington   This expedition  led by Cockburn and General Robert Ross  was carried out between August 19 and 29  1814  as the result of the hardened British policy of 1814  although British and American commissioners had convened peace negotiations at Ghent in June of that year   As part of this  Admiral Warren had been replaced as commander in chief by Admiral Alexander Cochrane  with reinforcements and orders to coerce the Americans into a favourable peace  Burning of Washington 1814 Governor in chief of British North America Sir George Prevost had written to the Admirals in Bermuda  calling for retaliation for the American sacking of York  now Toronto   A force of 2 500 soldiers under General Ross had just arrived in Bermuda aboard HMS Royal Oak  three frigates  three sloops and ten other vessels  Released from the Peninsular War by British victory  the British intended to use them for diversionary raids along the coasts of Maryland and Virginia  In response to Prevost s request  they decided to employ this force  together with the naval and military units already on the station  to strike at Washington  D C  On August 24  U S  Secretary of War John Armstrong insisted that the British would attack Baltimore rather than Washington  even when the British army was obviously on its way to the capital  The inexperienced American militia  which had congregated at Bladensburg  Maryland  to protect the capital  was routed in the Battle of Bladensburg  opening the route to Washington  While Dolley Madison saved valuables from the Presidential Mansion  President James Madison was forced to flee to Virginia  80  The British commanders ate the supper that had been prepared for the President before they burned the Presidential Mansion  American morale was reduced to an all time low  The British viewed their actions as retaliation for destructive American raids into Canada  most notably the Americans  burning of York  now Toronto  in 1813  Later that same evening  a furious storm swept into Washington  D C   sending one or more tornadoes into the city that caused more damage but finally extinguished the fires with torrential rains  81  The naval yards were set afire at the direction of U S  officials to prevent the capture of naval ships and supplies  80  The British left Washington  D C  as soon as the storm subsided  Having destroyed Washington s public buildings  including the President s Mansion and the Treasury  the British army next moved to capture Baltimore  a busy port and a key base for American privateers  The subsequent Battle of Baltimore began with the British landing at North Point  where they were met by American militia  An exchange of fire began  with casualties on both sides  General Ross was killed by an American sniper as he attempted to rally his troops  The sniper himself was killed moments later  and the British withdrew  The British also attempted to attack Baltimore by sea on September 13 but were unable to reduce Fort McHenry  at the entrance to Baltimore Harbor  An artist s rendering of the battle at Fort McHenry  where Francis Scott Key was inspired to write  The Star Spangled Banner   The Battle of Fort McHenry was no battle at all  British guns had range on American cannon  and stood off out of U S  range  bombarding the fort  which returned no fire  Their plan was to coordinate with a land force  but from that distance coordination proved impossible  so the British called off the attack and left  All the lights were extinguished in Baltimore the night of the attack  and the fort was bombarded for 25 hours  The only light was given off by the exploding shells over Fort McHenry  illuminating the flag that was still flying over the fort  The defence of the fort inspired the American lawyer Francis Scott Key to write a poem that would eventually supply the lyrics to  The Star Spangled Banner   None of the actions of the Chesapeake campaign were deemed worthy of a British army medal clasp  Fort Detroit  Chateauguay  Chrysler s Farm being the three clasps for the war   but participants in the attack in Washington were paid prize money by the War Office  82  In addition  prize money arising from the booty captured by the expedition in the River Patuxent  at Fort Washington  and Alexandria  between 22 and 29 August 1814 was paid in November 1817  Three companies of Corps of Colonial Marines were among the recipients  A first class share was worth  183 9s 1 d  a sixth class share  which was what probably an ordinary marine would receive  was worth  1 9s 3 d  83  A second and final payment came in May 1819  A first class share was worth  42 13s 10 d  a sixth class share was worth 9s 1 d  84  Great Lakes and Western Territories Invasions of Upper and Lower Canada  1812 Map showing the northern theatre of the War of 1812 American leaders assumed that Canada could be easily overrun  Former President Jefferson optimistically referred to the conquest of Canada as  a matter of marching   Many Loyalist Americans had migrated to Upper Canada after the Revolutionary War  and the US assumed they would favour the American cause  but they did not  In prewar Upper Canada  General Prevost was in the unusual position of having to purchase many provisions for his troops from the American side  This peculiar trade persisted throughout the war in spite of an abortive attempt by the US government to curtail it  In Lower Canada  which was much more populous  support for Britain came from the English elite with strong loyalty to the Empire  and from the French elite  who feared American conquest would destroy the old order by introducing Protestantism  Anglicization  republican democracy  and commercial capitalism  and weakening the Catholic Church  The French inhabitants feared the loss of a shrinking area of good lands to potential American immigrants  85  In 1812 13  British military experience prevailed over inexperienced American commanders  Geography dictated that operations would take place in the west  principally around Lake Erie  near the Niagara River between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario  and near the Saint Lawrence River area and Lake Champlain  This was the focus of the three pronged attacks by the Americans in 1812  Although cutting the St  Lawrence River through the capture of Montreal and Quebec would have made Britain s hold in North America unsustainable  the United States began operations first in the western frontier because of the general popularity there of a war with the British  who had sold arms to the Native Americans  opposing the settlers  The British scored an important early success when their detachment at St  Joseph Island  on Lake Huron  learned of the declaration of war before the nearby American garrison at the important trading post at Mackinac Island in Michigan  A scratch force landed on the island on July 17  1812 and mounted a gun overlooking Fort Mackinac  After the British fired one shot from their gun  the Americans  taken by surprise  surrendered  This early victory encouraged the natives  and large numbers moved to help the British at Amherstburg  An American army under the command of William Hull invaded Canada on July 12  with his forces chiefly composed of untrained and ill disciplined militiamen  86  Once on Canadian soil  Hull issued a proclamation ordering all British subjects to surrender  or  the horrors  and calamities of war will stalk before you   He also threatened to kill any British prisoner caught fighting alongside a native  The proclamation helped stiffen resistance to the American attacks  Hull s army was too weak in artillery and badly supplied to achieve its objectives  and had to fight just to maintain its own lines of communication  The senior British officer in Upper Canada  Major General Isaac Brock  felt that he should take bold measures to calm the settler population in Canada  and to convince the aboriginals who were needed to defend the region that Britain was strong  86  He moved rapidly to Amherstburg near the western end of Lake Erie with reinforcements and immediately decided to attack Detroit  Hull  fearing that the British possessed superior numbers and that the Indians attached to Brock s force would commit massacres if fighting began  surrendered Detroit without a fight on August 16  Knowing of British instigated indigenous attacks on other locations  Hull ordered the evacuation of the inhabitants of Fort Dearborn  Chicago  to Fort Wayne  After initially being granted safe passage  the inhabitants  soldiers and civilians  were attacked by Potowatomis on August 15 after travelling only 2 miles  3 2 km  in what is known as the Battle of Fort Dearborn  87  The fort was subsequently burned  Brock promptly transferred himself to the eastern end of Lake Erie  where American General Stephen Van Rensselaer was attempting a second invasion  An armistice  arranged by Prevost in the hope the British renunciation of the Orders in Council to which the United States objected might lead to peace  prevented Brock from invading American territory  When the armistice ended  the Americans attempted an attack across the Niagara River on October 13  but suffered a crushing defeat at Queenston Heights  Brock was killed during the battle  While the professionalism of the American forces would improve by the war s end  British leadership suffered after Brock s death  A final attempt in 1812 by American General Henry Dearborn to advance north from Lake Champlain failed when his militia refused to advance beyond American territory  In contrast to the American militia  the Canadian militia performed well  French Canadians  who found the anti Catholic stance of most of the United States troublesome  and United Empire Loyalists  who had fought for the Crown during the American Revolutionary War  strongly opposed the American invasion  However  many in Upper Canada were recent settlers from the United States who had no obvious loyalties to the Crown  Nevertheless  while there were some who sympathized with the invaders  the American forces found strong opposition from men loyal to the Empire  88  American Northwest  1813 After Hull s surrender of Detroit  General William Henry Harrison was given command of the U S  Army of the Northwest  He set out to retake the city  which was now defended by Colonel Henry Procter in conjunction with Tecumseh  A detachment of Harrison s army was defeated at Frenchtown along the River Raisin on January 22  1813  Procter left the prisoners with an inadequate guard  who could not prevent some of his North American aboriginal allies from attacking and killing perhaps as many as sixty Americans  many of whom were Kentucky militiamen  89  The incident became known as the River Raisin Massacre  The defeat ended Harrison s campaign against Detroit  and the phrase  Remember the River Raisin   became a rallying cry for the Americans  Oliver Hazard Perry s message to William Henry Harrison after the Battle of Lake Erie began with what would become one of the most famous sentences in American military history   We have met the enemy and they are ours   This 1865 painting by William H  Powell shows Perry transferring to a different ship during the battle  In May 1813  Procter and Tecumseh set siege to Fort Meigs in northern Ohio  American reinforcements arriving during the siege were defeated by the natives  but the fort held out  The Indians eventually began to disperse  forcing Procter and Tecumseh to return to Canada  A second offensive against Fort Meigs also failed in July  In an attempt to improve Indian morale  Procter and Tecumseh attempted to storm Fort Stephenson  a small American post on the Sandusky River  only to be repulsed with serious losses  marking the end of the Ohio campaign  On Lake Erie  American commander Captain Oliver Hazard Perry fought the Battle of Lake Erie on September 10  1813  His decisive victory ensured American control of the lake  improved American morale after a series of defeats  and compelled the British to fall back from Detroit  This paved the way for General Harrison to launch another invasion of Upper Canada  which culminated in the U S  victory at the Battle of the Thames on October 5  1813  in which Tecumseh was killed  Tecumseh s death effectively ended the North American indigenous alliance with the British in the Detroit region  American control of Lake Erie meant the British could no longer provide essential military supplies to their aboriginal allies  who therefore dropped out of the war  The Americans controlled the area during the conflict  Niagara frontier  1813 Because of the difficulties of land communications  control of the Great Lakes and the St  Lawrence River corridor was crucial  When the war began  the British already had a small squadron of warships on Lake Ontario and had the initial advantage  To redress the situation  the Americans established a Navy yard at Sackett s Harbor  New York  Commodore Isaac Chauncey took charge of the large number of sailors and shipwrights sent there from New York  they completed the second warship built there in a mere 45 days  Ultimately  3 000 men worked at the shipyard  building eleven warships and many smaller boats and transports  Having regained the advantage by their rapid building program  Chauncey and Dearborn attacked York  now called Toronto   the capital of Upper Canada  on April 27  1813  The Battle of York was an American victory  marred by looting and the burning of the Parliament buildings and a library  However  Kingston was strategically more valuable to British supply and communications along the St  Lawrence  Without control of Kingston  the U S  navy could not effectively control Lake Ontario or sever the British supply line from Lower Canada  On May 27  1813  an American amphibious force from Lake Ontario assaulted Fort George on the northern end of the Niagara River and captured it without serious losses  The retreating British forces were not pursued  however  until they had largely escaped and organized a counteroffensive against the advancing Americans at the Battle of Stoney Creek on June 5  On June 24  with the help of advance warning by Loyalist Laura Secord  another American force was forced to surrender by a much smaller British and native force at the Battle of Beaver Dams  marking the end of the American offensive into Upper Canada  Meanwhile  Commodore James Lucas Yeo had taken charge of the British ships on the lake and mounted a counterattack  which was nevertheless repulsed at the Battle of Sackett s Harbor  Thereafter  Chauncey and Yeo s squadrons fought two indecisive actions  neither commander seeking a fight to the finish  Late in 1813  the Americans abandoned the Canadian territory they occupied around Fort George  They set fire to the village of Newark  now Niagara on the Lake  on December 15  1813  incensing the Canadians and politicians in control  Many of the inhabitants were left without shelter  freezing to death in the snow  This led to British retaliation following the Capture of Fort Niagara on December 18  1813  Early the next morning on December 19  the British and their native allies stormed the neighbouring town of Lewiston  New York  torching homes and buildings and killing about a dozen civilians  As the British were chasing the surviving residents out of town  a small force of Tuscarora natives intervened and stopped the pursuit  buying enough time for the locals to escape to safer ground  It is notable in that the Tuscaroras defended the Americans against their own Iroquois brothers  the Mohawks  who sided with the British  90  91  Later  the British attacked and burned Buffalo on December 30  1813  Attack on Fort Oswego  May 1814   War of 1812 Sakawarton  John Smoke Johnson   John Tutela  and Young Warner  three Six Nations veterans of the War of 1812  In 1814  the contest for Lake Ontario turned into a building race  Eventually  by the end of the year  Yeo had constructed HMS St  Lawrence  a first rate ship of the line of 112 guns that gave him superiority  but the Engagements on Lake Ontario were an indecisive draw  St  Lawrence and Lower Canada  1813 The British were potentially most vulnerable over the stretch of the St  Lawrence where it formed the frontier between Upper Canada and the United States  During the early days of the war  there was illicit commerce across the river  Over the winter of 1812 and 1813  the Americans launched a series of raids from Ogdensburg on the American side of the river  which hampered British supply traffic up the river  On February 21  Sir George Prevost passed through Prescott on the opposite bank of the river with reinforcements for Upper Canada  When he left the next day  the reinforcements and local militia attacked  At the Battle of Ogdensburg  the Americans were forced to retire  For the rest of the year  Ogdensburg had no American garrison  and many residents of Ogdensburg resumed visits and trade with Prescott  This British victory removed the last American regular troops from the Upper St  Lawrence frontier and helped secure British communications with Montreal  Late in 1813  after much argument  the Americans made two thrusts against Montreal  The plan eventually agreed upon was for Major General Wade Hampton to march north from Lake Champlain and join a force under General James Wilkinson that would embark in boats and sail from Sackett s Harbor on Lake Ontario and descend the St  Lawrence  Hampton was delayed by bad roads and supply problems and also had an intense dislike of Wilkinson  which limited his desire to support his plan  On October 25  his 4 000 strong force was defeated at the Chateauguay River by Charles de Salaberry s smaller force of French Canadian Voltigeurs and Mohawks  Wilkinson s force of 8 000 set out on October 17  but was also delayed by bad weather  After learning that Hampton had been checked  Wilkinson heard that a British force under Captain William Mulcaster and Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Wanton Morrison was pursuing him  and by November 10  he was forced to land near Morrisburg  about 150 kilometres  90 mi   from Montreal  On November 11  Wilkinson s rear guard  numbering 2 500  attacked Morrison s force of 800 at Crysler s Farm and was repulsed with heavy losses  After learning that Hampton could not renew his advance  Wilkinson retreated to the U S  and settled into winter quarters  He resigned his command after a failed attack on a British outpost at Lacolle Mills  Niagara and Plattsburgh Campaigns  1814 By the middle of 1814  American generals  including Major Generals Jacob Brown and Winfield Scott  had drastically improved the fighting abilities and discipline of the army  Their renewed attack on the Niagara peninsula quickly captured Fort Erie  Winfield Scott then gained a victory over an inferior British force at the Battle of Chippawa on July 5  An attempt to advance further ended with a hard fought but inconclusive battle at Lundy s Lane on July 25  The outnumbered Americans withdrew but withstood a prolonged Siege of Fort Erie  The British suffered heavy casualties in a failed assault and were weakened by exposure and shortage of supplies in their siege lines  Eventually the British raised the siege  but American Major General George Izard took over command on the Niagara front and followed up only halfheartedly  The Americans lacked provisions  and eventually destroyed the fort and retreated across the Niagara  Meanwhile  following the abdication of Napoleon  15 000 British troops were sent to North America under four of Wellington s ablest brigade commanders  Fewer than half were veterans of the Peninsula and the rest came from garrisons  Prevost was ordered to neutralize American power on the lakes by burning Sackets Harbor  gain naval control of Lake Erie  Lake Ontario and the Upper Lakes  and defend Lower Canada from attack  He did defend Lower Canada but otherwise failed to achieve his objectives  92  Given the late season he decided to invade New York State  His army outnumbered the American defenders of Plattsburgh  but he was worried about his flanks so he decided he needed naval control of Lake Champlain  On the lake  the British squadron under Captain George Downie and the Americans under Master Commandant Thomas Macdonough were more evenly matched  On reaching Plattsburgh  Prevost delayed the assault until the arrival of Downie in the hastily completed 36 gun frigate HMS Confiance  Prevost forced Downie into a premature attack  but then unaccountably failed to provide the promised military backing  Downie was killed and his naval force defeated at the naval Battle of Plattsburgh in Plattsburgh Bay on September 11  1814  The Americans now had control of Lake Champlain  Theodore Roosevelt later termed it  the greatest naval battle of the war   The successful land defence was led by Alexander Macomb  To the astonishment of his senior officers  Prevost then turned back  saying it would be too hazardous to remain on enemy territory after the loss of naval supremacy  Prevost was recalled and in London  a naval court martial decided that defeat had been caused principally by Prevost s urging the squadron into premature action and then failing to afford the promised support from the land forces  Prevost died suddenly  just before his own court martial was to convene  Prevost s reputation sank to a new low  as Canadians claimed that their militia under Brock did the job and he failed  Recently  however  historians have been more kindly  measuring him not against Wellington but against his American foes  They judge Prevost s preparations for defending the Canadas with limited means to be energetic  well conceived  and comprehensive  and against the odds  he had achieved the primary objective of preventing an American conquest  85  American West  1813 14 The Upper Mississippi River during the War of 1812  1  Fort Bellefontaine U S  headquarters  2  Fort Osage  abandoned 1813  3  Fort Madison  defeated 1813  4  Fort Shelby  defeated 1814  5  Battle of Rock Island Rapids  July 1814 and the Battle of Credit Island  Sept  1814  6  Fort Johnson  abandoned 1814  7  Fort Cap au Gris and the Battle of the Sink Hole  May 1815  Plans of the original Fort Madison in 1810  captured by British supported Indians in 1813  The Mississippi River valley was the western frontier of the United States in 1812  The territory acquired in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 contained almost no U S  settlements west of the Mississippi except around Saint Louis and a few forts and trading posts  Fort Bellefontaine  an old trading post converted to a U S  Army post in 1804  served as regional headquarters  Fort Osage  built in 1808 along the Missouri was the western most U S  outpost  it was abandoned at the start of the war  93 Fort Madison  built along the Mississippi in what is now Iowa  was also built in 1808  and had been repeatedly attacked by British allied Sauk since its construction  In September 1813 Fort Madison was abandoned after it was attacked and besieged by natives  who had support from the British  This was one of the few battles fought west of the Mississippi  Black Hawk played a leadership role  94  Little of note took place on Lake Huron in 1813  but the American victory on Lake Erie and the recapture of Detroit isolated the British there  During the ensuing winter  a Canadian party under Lieutenant Colonel Robert McDouall established a new supply line from York to Nottawasaga Bay on Georgian Bay  When he arrived at Fort Mackinac with supplies and reinforcements  he sent an expedition to recapture the trading post of Prairie du Chien in the far west  The Siege of Prairie du Chien ended in a British victory on July 20  1814  Earlier in July  the Americans sent a force of five vessels from Detroit to recapture Mackinac  A mixed force of regulars and volunteers from the militia landed on the island on August 4  They did not attempt to achieve surprise  and at the brief Battle of Mackinac Island  they were ambushed by natives and forced to re embark  The Americans discovered the new base at Nottawasaga Bay  and on August 13  they destroyed its fortifications and a schooner that they found there  They then returned to Detroit  leaving two gunboats to blockade Mackinac  On September 4  these gunboats were taken unawares and captured by enemy boarding parties from canoes and small boats  This Engagement on Lake Huron left Mackinac under British control  The British garrison at Prairie du Chien also fought off another attack by Major Zachary Taylor  In this distant theatre  the British retained the upper hand until the end of the war  through the allegiance of several indigenous tribes that received British gifts and arms  In 1814 U S  troops retreating from the Battle of Credit Island on the upper Mississippi attempted to make a stand at Fort Johnson  but the fort was soon abandoned  along with most of the upper Mississippi valley  95  After the U S  was pushed out of the Upper Mississippi region  they held on to eastern Missouri and the St  Louis area  Two notable battles fought against the Sauk were the Battle of Cote Sans Dessein  in April 1815  at the mouth of the Osage River in the Missouri Territory  and the Battle of the Sink Hole  in May 1815  near Fort Cap au Gris  96  At the conclusion of peace  Mackinac and other captured territory was returned to the United States  Fighting between Americans  the Sauk  and other indigenous tribes continued through 1817  well after the war ended in the east  97  Southern theatre Creek War Main article  Creek War In March 1814  Jackson led a force of Tennessee militia  Choctaw  98 Cherokee warriors  and U S  regulars southward to attack the Creek tribes  led by Chief Menawa  The British were attempting to send supplies to their allies but they arrived too late  On March 26  Jackson and General John Coffee decisively defeated the Creek at Horseshoe Bend  killing 800 of 1 000 Creeks at a cost of 49 killed and 154 wounded out of approximately 2 000 American and Cherokee forces  Jackson pursued the surviving Creek until they surrendered  Most historians consider the Creek War as part of the War of 1812  because the British supported them  New Orleans Main article  Battle of New Orleans Andrew Jackson heard reports that the British were organizing ships and armies for a large scale invasion  The British set up a base at Pensacola  Florida in August 1814  Jackson with 4 000 men took the town in November  99  Unaware of the Ghent treaty  Andrew Jackson s force moved to New Orleans  Louisiana  in late 1814  Using 1 000 regulars and 3 000 to 4 000 militia  pirates and other fighters  as well as civilians and slaves sent to work on the fortifications  he built strong defences just south of the city  which was 150 miles  240 km  north of the Gulf  The 8 000 British regulars under General Edward Pakenham attacked on January 8  1815  The Battle of New Orleans was a smashing American victory  as the British suffered 2 000 casualties  291 dead  including Pakenham and his second and third in command   1262 wounded  and 484 captured or missing  100  101  102  The Americans had 71 casualties  13 dead  39 wounded  and 19 missing  It was hailed as a great victory for the U S   making Jackson a national hero and eventually propelling him to the presidency  53  103  Alabama James Wilkinson captured Mobile  Alabama from the Spanish in March 1813  and built fortifications  In early 1815 the British gave up on New Orleans but moved to attack Mobile  In one of the last military actions of the war  1 000 British troops won the Battle of Fort Bowyer on February 12  1815  When news of peace arrived the next day  they abandoned the fort and sailed home  Postwar fighting In May 1815  a band of British allied Sauk  unaware that the war had ended months before  attacked a small band of U S  soldiers northwest of St  Louis  104  Intermittent fighting  primarily with the Sauk  continued in the Missouri Territory well into 1817  although it is unknown if the Sauk were acting on their own or on behalf of British agents  105  Several uncontacted isolated warships continued fighting well into 1815 and were the last American forces to take offensive action against the British  The Treaty of Ghent Main article  Treaty of Ghent Factors leading to the peace negotiations By 1814  both sides had achieved their main war goals and were weary of a costly war that offered little but stalemate  They both sent delegations to a neutral site in Ghent  Belgium  The negotiations began in early August and concluded on December 24  when a final agreement was signed  both sides had to ratify it before it could take effect  Meanwhile both sides planned new invasions  In 1814 the British began blockading New England ports  reducing American foreign trade to a trickle  but hurting British interests in the West Indies and Canada that had depended on that trade  New England was considering secession  106  107  But although American privateers found chances of success much reduced  with most British merchantmen now sailing in convoy  privateering continued to prove troublesome to the British  as shown by high insurance rates  108  British landowners grew weary of high taxes  and colonial interests and merchants called on the government to reopen trade with the U S  by ending the war  109  Negotiations and peace Britain  which had forces in uninhabited areas near Lake Superior and Lake Michigan and two towns in Maine  demanded the cession of large areas  plus turning most of the Midwest into a neutral zone for Indians  American public opinion was outraged when Madison published the demands  even the Federalists were now willing to fight on  The British were planning three invasions  One force burned Washington but failed to capture Baltimore  and sailed away when its commander was killed  In New York State  10 000 British veterans were marching south until a decisive defeat at the Battle of Plattsburgh forced them back to Canada  nb 2  Nothing was known of the fate of the third large invasion force aimed at capturing New Orleans and southwest  The Prime Minister wanted the Duke of Wellington to command in Canada and finally win the war  Wellington said that he would go to America but he believed he was needed in Europe  110  111  112  He also stated  I think you have no right  from the state of war  to demand any concession of territory from America     You have not been able to carry it into the enemy s territory  notwithstanding your military success and now undoubted military superiority  and have not even cleared your own territory on the point of attack  You cannot on any principle of equality in negotiation claim a cessation of territory except in exchange for other advantages which you have in your power     Then if this reasoning be true  why stipulate for the uti possidetis  You can get no territory  indeed  the state of your military operations  however creditable  does not entitle you to demand any  113  114  The Prime Minister  Lord Liverpool  aware of growing opposition to wartime taxation and the demands of Liverpool and Bristol merchants to reopen trade with America  realized Britain had little to gain and much to lose from prolonged warfare  115  116  On December 24  1814 the diplomats in Ghent signed the Treaty of Ghent  The treaty was ratified by the British three days later on December 27 117  118  119  and arrived in Washington on February 17 where it was quickly ratified and went into effect  thus finally ending the war  The terms called for all occupied territory was to be returned  the prewar boundary between Canada and the United States would be restored  and the Americans were to gain fishing rights in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence  The treaty ignored the grievances that led to war  American complaints of Indian raids  impressment and blockades had ended when Britain s war with France ended in 1814  and were not mentioned in the treaty  Mobile and parts of western Florida were not mentioned in the treaty but remained permanently in American possession  despite objections by Spain  120  Thus  the war ended with no significant territorial losses for either side  Impressment could have become an issue during Napoleon s reappearance for the Hundred Days  for which Britain remanned her fleet  however  the British did not search American ships for British sailors at Liverpool  even the American official position conceded that they had the right to do in British ports   and when William Eustis  American minister to the Netherlands  complained of the impressment of a seaman off an American ship  the captain responsible was recalled to explain his actions  After the second fall of Napoleon  impressment was largely abandoned  121  Losses and compensation British losses in the war were about 1 600 killed in action and 3 679 wounded  3 321 British died from disease  American losses were 2 260 killed in action and 4 505 wounded  While the number of Americans who died from disease is not known  it is estimated that about 15 000 died from all causes directly related to the war  122  These figures do not include deaths among Canadian militia forces or losses among native tribes  There have been no estimates of the cost of the American war to Britain  but it did add some  25 million to the national debt  123  In the U S   the cost was  105 million  about the same as the cost to Britain  The national debt rose from  45 million in 1812 to  127 million by the end of 1815  although by selling bonds and treasury notes at deep discounts and often for irredeemable paper money due to the suspension of specie payment in 1814 the government received only  34 million worth of specie  124  125  In addition  at least 3 000 American slaves escaped to the British because of their offer of freedom  the same as they had made in the American Revolution  Many other slaves simply escaped in the chaos of war and achieved their freedom on their own  The British settled some of the newly freed slaves in Nova Scotia  126  Four hundred freedmen were settled in New Brunswick  127  The Americans protested that Britain s failure to return the slaves violated the Treaty of Ghent  After arbitration by the Tsar of Russia the British paid  1 204 960 in damages to Washington  which reimbursed the slaveowners  128  Memory and historiography Popular views During the 19th century the popular image of the war in the United States was of an American victory  and in Canada  of a Canadian victory  Each young country saw her self perceived victory as an important foundation of her growing nationhood  The British  on the other hand  who had been preoccupied by Napoleon s challenge in Europe  paid little attention to what was to them a peripheral and secondary dispute  Canadian In British North America  which formed the Dominion of Canada in 1867   the War of 1812 was seen by Loyalists as a victory  as they had successfully defended their borders from an American takeover  The outcome gave Empire oriented Canadians confidence and  together with the postwar  militia myth  that the civilian militia had been primarily responsible rather than the British regulars  was used to stimulate a new sense of Canadian nationalism  129  A long term implication of the militia myth which was false  but remained popular in the Canadian public at least until World War I was that Canada did not need a regular professional army  130  The U S  Army had done poorly  on the whole  in several attempts to invade Canada  and the Canadians had shown that they would fight bravely to defend their country  But the British did not doubt that the thinly populated territory would be vulnerable in a third war   We cannot keep Canada if the Americans declare war against us again   Admiral Sir David Milne wrote to a correspondent in 1817  131  By the 21st century it was a forgotten war in Britain and Quebec  although still remembered in the rest of Canada  especially Ontario  In a 2009 poll  37  of Canadians said the war was a Canadian victory  9  said the U S  won  15  called it a draw  and 39  mainly younger Canadians said they knew too little to comment  132  A February 2012 poll found that in a list of items that could be used to define Canadians  identity  the fact that Canada successfully repelled an American invasion in the War of 1812 places second  25    only behind the fact that Canada has universal health care  53    133  The Canadian comedy troupe Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie released a popular parody song in 2000 called the  The White House Burned  War of 1812    citation needed  American Today  American popular memory includes the British capture and the burning of Washington in August 1814  which necessitated its extensive renovation  Another memory is the successful American defence of Fort McHenry in September 1814  which inspired the lyrics of the U S  national anthem  The Star Spangled Banner  134  The successful Captains of the U S  Navy became popular heroes with plates with the likeness of Decatur  Steward  Hull  and others  becoming popular items  Ironically  many were made in England  The Navy became a cherished institution beloved for the victories that it gave against all odds  135  The war remained in the American popular consciousness as late as the later 20th century due to the song The Battle of New Orleans  Historians  views Historians have differing and more complex interpretations  They are in full agreement that the native Indians were the war s clear losers  losing land  power and any hope of keeping their semi autonomous status  Historians also agree that ending the war with neither side gaining or losing territory allowed for the peaceful settlement of boundary disputes and for the opening of a permanent era of good will and friendly relations between the U S  and Canada  In recent decades the view of the majority of historians has been that the war ended in stalemate  with the Treaty of Ghent closing a war that had become militarily inconclusive  Neither side wanted to continue fighting since the main causes had disappeared and since there were no large lost territories for one side or the other to reclaim by force  Insofar as they see the war s untriumphant resolution as allowing two centuries of peaceful and mutually beneficial intercourse between the U S   Britain and Canada  these historians often conclude that all three nations were the  real winners  of the War of 1812  These writers often add that the war could have been avoided in the first place by better diplomacy  It is seen as a mistake for everyone concerned because it was badly planned and marked by multiple fiascoes and failures on both sides  as shown especially by the repeated American failure to seize parts of Canada  and the failed British invasions of New Orleans and upstate New York  136  137  However  other scholars hold that the war constituted a British victory and an American defeat  They argue that the British achieved their military objectives in 1812  by stopping the repeated American invasions of Canada  and that Canada retained her independence of the United States  By contrast  they say  the Americans suffered a defeat when their armies failed to achieve their war goal of seizing part or all of Canada  Additionally  they argue the US lost as it failed to stop impressment  which the British refused to repeal until the end of the Napoleonic Wars  and the US actions had no effect on the orders in council  which were rescinded before the war started  138  139  A second minority view is that both the US and Britain won the war   that is  both achieved their main objectives  while the Indians were the losing party  140  141  The British won by losing no territories and achieving their great war goal  the total defeat of Napoleon  U S  won by  1  securing her honour and successfully resisting a powerful empire once again  nb 3  thus winning a  second war of independence   142   2  ending the threat of Indian raids and the British plan for a semi independent Indian sanctuary thereby opening an unimpeded path for the United States  westward expansion and  3  stopping the Royal Navy from restricting American trade and impressing American sailors  143  Long term consequences Main article  Results of the War of 1812 Neither side lost territory in the war  nb 4  nor did the treaty that ended it address the original points of contention and yet it changed much between the United States of America and Britain  The Rush Bagot Treaty was a treaty between the United States and Britain enacted in 1817 that provided for the demilitarization of the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain  where many British naval arrangements and forts still remained  The treaty laid the basis for a demilitarized boundary and was indicative of improving relations between the United States and Great Britain in the period following the War of 1812  It remains in effect to this day  The Treaty of Ghent established the status quo ante bellum  that is  there were no territorial losses by either side  The issue of impressment was made moot when the Royal Navy  no longer needing sailors  stopped impressment after the defeat of Napoleon  Except for occasional border disputes and the circumstances of the American Civil War  relations between the U S  and Britain remained generally peaceful for the rest of the 19th century  and the two countries became close allies in the 20th century  Border adjustments between the U S  and British North America were made in the Treaty of 1818  A border dispute along the Maine New Brunswick border was settled by the 1842 Webster Ashburton Treaty after the bloodless Aroostook War  and the border in the Oregon Territory was settled by splitting the disputed area in half by the 1846 Oregon Treaty  United States The U S  suppressed the native American resistance on its western and southern borders  The nation also gained a psychological sense of complete independence as people celebrated their  second war of independence   144  145  Nationalism soared after the victory at the Battle of New Orleans  The opposition Federalist Party collapsed  and the Era of Good Feelings ensued  146  No longer questioning the need for a strong Navy  the U S  built three new 74 gun ships of the line and two new 44 gun frigates shortly after the end of the war  147   Another frigate had been destroyed to prevent it being captured on the stocks   148  In 1816  the U S  Congress passed into law an  Act for the gradual increase of the Navy  at a cost of  1 000 000 a year for eight years  authorizing 9 ships of the line and 12 heavy frigates  149  The Captains and Commodores of the U S  Navy became the heroes of their generation in the U S  Decorated plates and pitchers of Decatur  Hull  Bainbridge  Lawrence  Perry  and Macdonough were made in Staffordshire  England  and found a ready market in the United States  Three of the war heroes used their celebrity to win national office  Andrew Jackson  elected President in 1828 and 1832   Richard Mentor Johnson  elected Vice President in 1836   and William Henry Harrison  elected President in 1840   New England states became increasingly frustrated over how the war was being conducted and how the conflict was affecting them  They complained that the U S  government was not investing enough in the states  defences militarily and financially  and that the states should have more control over their militia  The increased taxes  the British blockade  and the occupation of some of New England by enemy forces also agitated public opinion in the states  150  As a result  at the Hartford Convention  December 1814 January 1815  held in Connecticut  New England representatives asked New England to have its states  powers fully restored  Nevertheless  a common misconception propagated by newspapers of the time was that the New England representatives wanted to secede from the Union and make a separate peace with the British  This view is not supported by what happened at the Convention  151  This war enabled thousands of slaves to escape to British lines or ships for freedom  despite the difficulties  The planters  complacency about slave contentment was shocked by their seeing slaves who would risk so much to be free  126  British North

as a defence against the United States  the fort remains an operational base of the Canadian Forces  Additionally  work began on the Halifax citadel to defend the port against American attacks  This fort remained in operation through World War II  From 1826 to 1832  the Rideau Canal was built to provide a secure waterway from Bytown  now Ottawa  to Kingston via the Rideau River then southwest via the canal to Lake Ontario  avoiding the narrows of the St  Lawrence River  where ships could be vulnerable to American cannon fire  To defend the western end of the canal  the British also built Fort Henry at Kingston  including four Martello towers  which remained operational until 1891  Indigenous nations The Native Americans allied to the British lost their cause  The British proposal to create a  neutral  Indian zone in the American West was rejected at the Ghent peace conference and never resurfaced  After 1814 the natives  who lost most of their fur gathering territory  became an undesirable burden to British policymakers who now looked to the United States for markets and raw materials  British agents in the field continued to meet regularly with their former native partners  but they did not supply arms or encouragement and there were no Indian campaigns to stop U S  expansionism in the Midwest  Abandoned by their powerful sponsor  Great Lakes area natives ultimately migrated or reached accommodations with the American authorities and settlers  152  In the Southeast  Indian resistance had been crushed by General Andrew Jackson  as President  1829 37   Jackson systematically removed the major tribes to reservations west of the Mississippi  153  Bermuda Bermuda had been largely left to the defences of its own militia and privateers prior to U S  independence  but the Royal Navy had begun buying up land and operating from there in 1795  as its location was a useful substitute for the lost U S  ports  It originally was intended to be the winter headquarters of the North American Squadron  but the war saw it rise to a new prominence  As construction work progressed through the first half of the 19th century  Bermuda became the permanent naval headquarters in Western waters  housing the Admiralty and serving as a base and dockyard  The military garrison was built up to protect the naval establishment  heavily fortifying the archipelago that came to be described as the  Gibraltar of the West   Defence infrastructure would remain the central leg of Bermuda s economy until after World War II  Britain The massive ongoing conflict against the French Empire under Napoleon ensured that the War of 1812 was never seen as more than a sideshow to the main event by the British  154  Britain s blockade of French trade had been entirely successful and the Royal Navy was the world s dominant nautical power  and would remain so for another century   While the land campaigns had contributed little  the Royal Navy had shut down American commerce  bottled up the U S  Navy in port and heavily suppressed privateering  The peace was generally welcomed by the British though there was disquiet at the rapid growth of the U S  However  the two nations quickly resumed trade after the end of the war and over time  a growing friendship  155  See also War of 1812 portal History of Canada portal History of Canada Indiana in the War of 1812 Kentucky in the War
