McKinley  born William McKinley  Jr   January 29  1843   September 14  1901  was the 25th President of the United States  serving from March 4  1897 until his death  McKinley led the nation to victory in the Spanish American War  raised protective tariffs to promote American industry  and maintained the nation on the gold standard in a rejection of inflationary proposals  McKinley s term ended with his assassination in September 1901  but his presidency began a period of over a third of a century dominated by the Republican Party  McKinley served in the Civil War and rose from private to brevet major  After the war  he settled in Canton  Ohio  where he practiced law and married Ida Saxton  In 1876  he was elected to Congress  where he became the Republican party s leading expert on the protective tariff  which he promised would bring prosperity  His 1890 McKinley Tariff was highly controversial  together with gerrymandering it led to his defeat in the Democratic landslide of 1890  He was elected Ohio s governor in 1891 and 1893  steering a moderate course between capital and labor interests while in office  With the aid of his close adviser Mark Hanna  he secured the Republican nomination for president in 1896  amid a deep economic depression  He defeated his Democratic rival  William Jennings Bryan  McKinley ran a front porch campaign in which he advocated  sound money   the gold standard unless altered by international agreement  and promised that high tariffs would restore prosperity  Rapid economic growth marked McKinley s presidency  He promoted the 1897 Dingley Tariff to protect manufacturers and factory workers from foreign competition  and in 1900  he secured the passage of the Gold Standard Act  McKinley hoped to persuade Spain to grant independence to rebellious Cuba without conflict  but when negotiation failed  led the nation in the Spanish American War of 1898  the U S  victory was quick and decisive  As part of the peace settlement Spain turned over its main overseas colonies of Puerto Rico  Guam  and the Philippines  and received  20 million for its improvements  Cuba was promised independence but at that time remained under the control of the U S  Army  The independent Republic of Hawaii joined the U S  in 1898 as a territory  McKinley was re elected in the 1900 presidential election following another intense campaign against Bryan  which focused on imperialism  prosperity  and free silver  President McKinley was assassinated by an anarchist in September 1901  and was succeeded by Vice President Theodore Roosevelt  Historians regard McKinley s 1896 victory as a realigning election  in which the political stalemate of the post Civil War era gave way to the Republican dominated Fourth Party System  which began with the Progressive Era  He is generally placed near the middle in rankings of American presidents  Contents 1 Early life and family 2 Civil War 2 1 Western Virginia and Antietam 2 2 Shenandoah Valley and

seventh child of William  and Nancy  Allison  McKinley  1  The McKinleys were of English and Scotch Irish descent and had settled in western Pennsylvania in the 18th century  There  the elder McKinley was born in Pine Township  1  The family moved to Ohio when the senior McKinley was a boy  settling in New Lisbon  now Lisbon   He met Nancy Allison there in 1829  and married her the same year  1  The Allison family was of mostly English blood and among Pennsylvania s earliest settlers  2  The family trade on both sides was iron making  and McKinley senior operated foundries in New Lisbon  Niles  Poland  and finally Canton  Ohio  3  The McKinley household was  like many from Ohio s Western Reserve  steeped in Whiggish and abolitionist sentiment  4  Religiously  the family was staunchly Methodist and young William followed in that tradition  becoming active in the local Methodist church at the age of sixteen  5  He was a lifelong pious Methodist  6  In 1852  the family moved from Niles to Poland so that their children could attend the better school there  Graduating in 1859  he enrolled the following year at Allegheny College in Meadville  Pennsylvania  He remained at Allegheny for only one year  returning home in 1860 after becoming ill and depressed  7  Although his health recovered  family finances declined and McKinley was unable to return to Allegheny  first working as a postal clerk and later taking a job teaching at a school near Poland  8   edit  Civil War  edit  Western Virginia and Antietam Rutherford B  Hayes was McKinley s mentor during the Civil War and afterward  When the southern states seceded from the Union and the American Civil War began  thousands of men in Ohio volunteered for service  9  Among them were McKinley and his cousin  William McKinley Osbourne  who enlisted as privates in the newly formed Poland Guards in June 1861  10  The men left for Columbus where they were consolidated with other small units to form the 23rd Ohio Infantry  11  The men were unhappy to learn that  unlike Ohio s earlier volunteer regiments  they would not be permitted to elect their officers  they would be designated by Ohio s governor  William Dennison  11  Dennison appointed Colonel William Rosecrans as the commander of the regiment  and the men began training on the outskirts of Columbus  11  McKinley quickly took to the soldier s life and wrote a series of letters to his hometown newspaper extolling the army and the Union cause  12  Delays in issuance of uniforms and weapons soon brought the men again into conflict with their officers  but Major Rutherford B  Hayes convinced them to accept what the government had issued them  his style in dealing with the men impressed McKinley  beginning an association and friendship that would last until Hayes  death in 1893  13  After a month of training  McKinley and the 23rd Ohio  now led by Colonel Eliakim P  Scammon  set out for western Virginia  today part of West Virginia  in July 1861 as a part of the Kanawha Division  14  McKinley initially thought Scammon was a martinet  but when the regiment finally saw battle  he came to appreciate the value of their relentless drilling  15  Their first contact with the enemy came in September when they drove back Confederate troops at Carnifex Ferry in present day West Virginia  16  Three days after the battle  McKinley was assigned to duty in the brigade quartermaster office  where he carried out clerical duties as well as working to supply the regiment  17  In November  the regiment moved deeper into western Virginia  where they entered winter quarters near Fayetteville  18  McKinley spent the winter substituting for a commissary sergeant who was ill  and in April 1862 he was promoted to that rank  19  The regiment resumed its advance that spring with Hayes in command  Scammon by then led the brigade  and fought several minor engagements against the rebel forces  20  That September  McKinley s regiment was called east to reinforce General John Pope s Army of Virginia at the Second Battle of Bull Run  21  Delayed in passing through Washington  D C   the 23rd Ohio did not arrive in time for the battle  but joined the Army of the Potomac as it hurried north to cut off Robert E  Lee s Army of Northern Virginia as it was advanced into Maryland  21  The 23rd was the first regiment to encounter the Confederates at the Battle of South Mountain on September 14  22  After severe losses  Union forces drove back the Confederates and continued to Sharpsburg  Maryland  where they engaged Lee s army at the Battle of Antietam  one of the bloodiest battles of the war  23  The 23rd was also in the thick of the fighting at Antietam  and McKinley himself came under heavy fire when bringing rations to the men on the line  23  a  McKinley s regiment again suffered many casualties  but the Army of the Potomac was victorious and the Confederates retreated into Virginia  23  The regiment was then detached from the Army of the Potomac and returned by train to western Virginia  24   edit  Shenandoah Valley and promotion McKinley in 1865  just after the war  Photograph by Matthew Brady  While the regiment went into winter quarters near Charleston  Virginia  present day West Virginia   McKinley was ordered back to Ohio with some other sergeants to recruit fresh troops  25  When they arrived in Columbus  Governor David Tod surprised McKinley with a commission as second lieutenant in recognition of his service at Antietam  25  McKinley and his comrades saw little action until July 1863  when the division skirmished with John Hunt Morgan s cavalry at the Battle of Buffington Island  26  Early in 1864  the Army command structure in West Virginia was reorganized  and the division was assigned to George Crook s Army of West Virginia  27  They soon resumed the offensive  marching into southwestern Virginia to destroy salt and lead mines used by the enemy  27  On May 9  the army engaged Confederate troops at Cloyd s Mountain  where the men charged the enemy entrenchments and drove the rebels from the field  27  McKinley later said the combat there was  as desperate as any witnessed during the war   27  Following the rout  the Union forces destroyed Confederate supplies and skirmished with the enemy again successfully  27  McKinley and his regiment moved to the Shenandoah Valley as the armies broke from winter quarters to resume hostilities  Crook s corps was attached to Major General David Hunter s Army of the Shenandoah and soon back in contact with Confederate forces  capturing Lexington  Virginia  on June 11  28  They continued south toward Lynchburg  tearing up railroad track as they advanced  28  Hunter believed the troops at Lynchburg were too powerful  however  and the brigade returned to West Virginia  28  Before the army could make another attempt  Confederate General Jubal Early s raid into Maryland forced their recall to the north  29  Early s army surprised them at Kernstown on July 24  where McKinley came under heavy fire and the army was defeated  30  Retreating into Maryland  the army was reorganized again  Major General Philip Sheridan replaced Hunter  and McKinley  who had been promoted to captain after the battle  was transferred to General Crook s staff  31  By August  Early was retreating south in the valley  with Sheridan s army in pursuit  32  They fended off a Confederate assault at Berryville  where McKinley had a horse shot out from under him  and advanced to Opequon Creek  where they broke the enemy lines and pursued them farther south  33  They followed up the victory with another at Fisher s Hill on September 22  and were engaged once more at Cedar Creek on October 19  34  After initially falling back from the Confederate advance  McKinley helped to rally the troops and turn the tide of the battle  34  After Cedar Creek  the army stayed in the vicinity through election day  when McKinley cast his first presidential ballot  for the incumbent Republican  Abraham Lincoln  34  The next day  they moved north up the valley into winter quarters near Kernstown  34  In February 1865  Crook was captured by Confederate raiders  35  Crook s capture added to the confusion as the army was reorganized for the spring campaign  and McKinley found himself serving on the staffs of four different generals over the next fifteen days Crook  John D  Stevenson  Samuel S  Carroll  and Winfield S  Hancock  35  Finally assigned to Carroll s staff again  McKinley acted as the general s first and only adjutant  36  Lee and his army surrendered to General Ulysses S  Grant a few days later  effectively ending the war  McKinley found time to join a Freemason lodge in Winchester  Virginia  before he and Carroll were transferred to Hancock s First Veterans Corps in Washington  37  Just before the war s end  McKinley received his final promotion  a brevet commission as major  38  In July  the Veterans Corps was mustered out of service  and McKinley and Carroll were relieved of their duties  38  Carroll and Hancock encouraged McKinley to apply for a place in the peacetime army  but he declined and returned to Ohio the following month  38   edit  Legal career and marriage Ida Saxton McKinley After the war ended in 1865  McKinley decided on a career in the law and began studying in the office of an attorney in Poland  Ohio  39  The following year  he continued his studies by attending Albany Law School in New York  40  After studying there for a year  McKinley returned home and was admitted to the bar in Warren  Ohio  in March 1867  40  That same year  he moved to Canton  the county seat of Stark County  and set up a small office  40  He soon formed a partnership with George W  Belden  an experienced lawyer and former judge  41  McKinley s practice was successful enough for him to buy a block of buildings on Main Street in Canton  which would provide him with small but consistent rental income for decades to come  41  When Hayes was nominated for governor in 1867  McKinley made speeches on his behalf in Stark County  his first foray into politics  42  The county was closely divided between Democrats and Republicans but Hayes carried it that year in his statewide victory  42  In 1869  McKinley ran for the office of prosecuting attorney of Stark County  an office usually then held by Democrats and was unexpectedly elected  43  When McKinley ran for re election in 1871  the Democrats nominated William A  Lynch  a prominent local lawyer  and McKinley was defeated by 143 votes  43  As McKinley s professional career progressed  so too did his social life blossom as he wooed Ida Saxton  the daughter of a prominent Canton family  43  They were married on January 25  1871 in the newly built First Presbyterian Church of Canton  although Ida soon joined her husband s Methodist church  44  Their first child  Katherine  was born on Christmas Day 1871  44  A second daughter  Ida  followed in 1873  but died the same year  44  McKinley s wife descended into a deep depression at her baby s death and her health  never robust  grew worse  44  Two years later  in 1875  Katherine died of typhoid fever  Ida never recovered from her daughters  deaths  the McKinleys had no more children  44  Ida McKinley developed epilepsy around the same time and thereafter disliked her husband leaving her side  44  He remained a devoted husband and tended to his wife s medical and emotional needs for the rest of his life  44  Ida insisted that McKinley continue his increasingly successful career in law and politics  45  He attended the state Republican convention that nominated Hayes for a third term as governor in 1875  and campaigned again for his old friend in the election that fall  45  The next year  McKinley undertook a high profile case defending a group of coal miners arrested for rioting after a clash with strikebreakers  46  Lynch  McKinley s opponent in the 1871 election  and his partner  William R  Day  were the opposing counsel  and the mine owners included Mark Hanna  a Cleveland businessman  46  Taking the case pro bono  he was successful in getting all but one of the miners acquitted  46  The case raised McKinley s standing among laborers  a crucial part of the Stark County electorate  and also introduced him to Hanna  who would become his strongest backer in years to come  46  McKinley s good standing with labor became useful that year as he campaigned for the Republican nomination for Ohio s 17th congressional district  47  Delegates to the county conventions thought he could attract blue collar voters  and in August 1876  McKinley was nominated  47  By that time  Hayes had been nominated for President  and McKinley campaigned for him while running his own congressional campaign  48  Both were successful  McKinley  campaigning mostly on his support for a protective tariff  defeated the Democratic nominee  Levi L  Lamborn  by 3 300 votes  while Hayes won a hotly disputed election to reach the presidency  48  McKinley s victory came at a personal cost his income as a congressman would be half of what he earned as a lawyer  49   edit  Rising politician 1877 1895  edit  Spokesman for protection Congressman McKinley For additional information on the currency question  see Cross of Gold speech Background  McKinley first took his congressional seat in October 1877  when President Hayes summoned Congress into special session  b  With the Republicans in the minority  McKinley was given unimportant committee assignments  which he undertook conscientiously  50  McKinley s friendship with Hayes did McKinley little good on Capitol Hill  the President was not well regarded by many leaders there  51  The young congressman broke with Hayes on the question of the currency  but it did not affect their friendship  52  The United States had effectively been placed on the gold standard by the Coinage Act of 1873  when silver prices dropped significantly  many sought to make silver again a legal tender  equally with gold  Such a course would be inflationary  advocates argued that the economic benefits of the increased money supply would be worth the inflation  opponents warned that  free silver  would not bring the promised benefits and would harm the United States in international trade  53  McKinley voted for the Bland Allison Act of 1878  which mandated large government purchases of silver for striking into money  and also joined the large majorities in each house that overrode Hayes  veto of the legislation  In so doing  McKinley voted against the position of the House Republican leader  his fellow Ohioan and friend  James Garfield  54  From his first term in Congress  McKinley was a strong advocate of protective tariffs  The primary purposes of such imposts was not to raise revenue  but to allow American manufacturing to develop by giving it a price advantage in the domestic market over foreign competitors  McKinley biographer Margaret Leech noted that Canton had become prosperous as a center for the manufacture of farm equipment because of protection  and that this may have helped form his political views  McKinley introduced and supported bills which raised protective tariffs  and opposed those which lowered them or imposed tariffs simply to raise revenue  55  Garfield s election as president in 1880 created a vacancy on the House Ways and Means Committee  McKinley was selected to fill it  placing him on the most powerful committee after only two terms  56  McKinley increasingly became a significant figure in national politics  In 1880  he served a brief term as Ohio s representative on the Republican National Committee  In 1884  he was elected a delegate to that year s Republican convention  where he served as chair of the Committee on Resolutions and won plaudits for his handling of the convention when called upon to preside  By 1886  McKinley  Senator John Sherman  and Governor Joseph B  Foraker were considered the leaders of the Republican party in Ohio  57  Sherman  who had helped to found the Republican Party  ran three times for the Republican nomination for president in the 1880s  each time failing  58  while Foraker began a meteoric rise in Ohio politics early in the decade  Hanna  once he entered public affairs as a political manager and generous contributor  supported Sherman s ambitions  as well as those of Foraker  The latter relationship broke off at the 1888 Republican National Convention  to which McKinley  Foraker  and Hanna were all delegates supporting Sherman  Convinced Sherman could not win  Foraker threw his support to the unsuccessful Republican 1884 presidential nominee  Maine Senator James G  Blaine  When Blaine stated he was not a candidate  Foraker backed the ultimately successful candidate  Indiana Governor Benjamin Harrison  who was elected president  In the bitterness that followed the convention  Hanna abandoned Foraker  and for the rest of McKinley s life  the Ohio Republican Party was divided into two factions  one aligned with McKinley  Sherman  and Hanna and the other with Foraker  59  Hanna came to admire McKinley and became a friend and close adviser to him  Although Hanna remained active in business and in promoting other Republicans  in the years after 1888  he spent an increasing amount of time boosting McKinley s political career  60  In 1889  with the Republicans in the majority  McKinley sought election as Speaker of the House  He failed to gain the post  which went to Thomas B  Reed of Maine  however  Speaker Reed appointed McKinley chairman of the Ways and Means Committee  The Ohioan guided through Congress the McKinley Tariff of 1890  although McKinley s work was altered through the influence of special interests in the Senate  imposed a number of protective tariffs on foreign goods  61   edit  Gerrymandering and defeat for re election Recognizing McKinley s potential  the Democrats  whenever they controlled the Ohio legislature  sought to gerrymander or redistrict him out of office  62  In 1878  McKinley faced election in a redrawn 17th district  he won anyway  causing Hayes to exult   Oh  the good luck of McKinley  He was gerrymandered out and then beat the gerrymander  We enjoyed it as much as he did   63  After the 1882 election  McKinley was unseated on an election contest by a near party line House vote  64  Out of office  he was briefly depressed by the setback  but soon vowed to run again  The Democrats again redistricted Stark County for the 1884 election  McKinley was returned to Congress anyway  65  Judge magazine cover from September 1890  showing McKinley  left  having helped dispatch Speaker Reed s opponent in early voting Maine  hurrying off with the victor to McKinley s  jerrymandered  Ohio district  For 1890  the Democrats gerrymandered McKinley one final time  placing Stark County in the same district as one of the strongest pro Democrat counties  Holmes  populated by solidly Democratic Pennsylvania Dutch  The new boundaries seemed to be good  based on past results  for a Democratic majority of 2000 to 3000  The Republicans could not reverse the gerrymander as legislative elections would not be held until 1891  but they could throw all their energies into the district  as the McKinley Tariff was a main theme of the Democratic campaign nationwide  and there was considerable attention paid to McKinley s race  The Republican Party sent its leading orators to Canton  including Blaine  then Secretary of State   Speaker Reed and President Harrison  The Democrats countered with their best spokesmen on tariff issues  66  McKinley tirelessly stumped his new district  reaching out to its 40 000 voters to explain that his tariff was framed for the people     as a defense to their industries  as a protection to the labor of their hands  as a safeguard to the happy homes of American workingmen  and as a security to their education  their wages  and their investments     It will bring to this country a prosperity unparalleled in our own history and unrivalled in the history of the world   67  Democrats ran a strong candidate in former lieutenant governor John G  Warwick  To drive their point home they hired young partisans to pretend to be peddlers  who went door to door offering 25 cent tinware to housewives for 50 cents  explaining the rise in prices was due to the McKinley Tariff  In the end  McKinley lost by 300 votes  but the Republicans won a statewide majority and claimed a moral victory  68   edit  Governor of Ohio Even before McKinley completed his term in Congress  he met with a delegation of Ohioans urging him to run for governor  Governor James E  Campbell  a Democrat  who had defeated Foraker in 1889  was to seek re election in 1891  The Ohio Republican party remained divided  but McKinley quietly arranged for Foraker to nominate him at the 1891 state Republican convention  which chose McKinley by acclamation  The former congressman spent much of the second half of 1891 campaigning against Campbell  beginning in his birthplace of Niles  Hanna  however  was little seen in the campaign  he spent much of his time raising funds for the election of legislators pledged to vote for Sherman in the 1892 senatorial election  69  70  c  McKinley won the 1891 election by some 20 000 votes  71  the following January  Sherman  with considerable assistance from Hanna  turned back a challenge by Foraker to win the legislature s vote for another term in the Senate  72  Even after his final run for president in 1884  James G  Blaine was still seen as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination  In this 1890 Puck cartoon  he is startling Reed and McKinley  right  as they make their plans for 1892  Ohio s governor had relatively little power for example  he could recommend legislation  but not veto it but with Ohio a key swing state  its governor was a major figure in national politics  73  Although McKinley believed that the health of the nation depended on that of business  he was evenhanded in dealing with labor  74  procuring legislation to set up an arbitration board at which work disputes could be settled  and obtaining passage of a law to fine employers who fired workers for belonging to a union  75  President Harrison had proven unpopular  there were divisions even within the Republican party as the year 1892 began and Harrison began his re election drive  Although no declared candidate opposed Harrison  many Republicans were ready to dump the President from the ticket if an alternative emerged  Among the possible candidates spoken of were McKinley  Reed  and the aging Blaine  Fearing that the Ohio governor would emerge as a candidate  Harrison s managers arranged for McKinley to be permanent chairman of the convention in Minneapolis  requiring him to play a public  neutral role  Hanna established an unofficial McKinley headquarters near the convention hall  though no active effort was made to convert delegates to McKinley s cause  McKinley objected to delegate votes being cast for him  nevertheless he finished third  behind the renominated Harrison  and behind Blaine  who had sent word he did not want to be considered  76  Although McKinley campaigned loyally for the Republican ticket  Harrison was defeated by former President Cleveland in the November election  In the wake of Cleveland s victory  McKinley was seen by some as the likely Republican candidate in 1896  77  Soon after Cleveland s return to office  hard times struck the nation with the Panic of 1893  A businessman in Youngstown  Robert Walker  had lent money to McKinley in their younger days  in gratitude  McKinley had often guaranteed Walker s borrowings for his business  The governor had never kept track of what he was signing  he believed Walker a sound businessman  In fact  Walker had deceived McKinley  telling him that new notes were actually renewals of matured ones  Walker was ruined by the recession  McKinley was called upon for repayment in February 1893   78  The total owed was over  100 000 and a despairing McKinley initially proposed to resign as governor and earn the money as an attorney  79  Instead  McKinley s wealthy supporters  including Hanna and Chicago publisher H  H  Kohlsaat  became trustees of a fund from which the notes would be paid  Both William and Ida McKinley placed their property in the hands of the fund s trustees  who included Hanna and Kohlsaat   and the supporters raised and contributed a substantial sum of money  All of the couple s property was returned to them by the end of 1893  and when McKinley  who had promised eventual repayment  asked for the list of contributors  it was refused him  Many people who had suffered in the hard times sympathized with McKinley  whose popularity grew  79  He was easily re elected in November 1893  receiving the largest percentage of the vote of any Ohio governor since the Civil War  80  McKinley campaigned widely for Republicans in the 1894 midterm congressional elections  many party candidates in districts where he spoke were successful  His political efforts in Ohio were rewarded by the election of a Republican successor as governor  Asa Bushnell in November 1895  and a Republican legislature that elected Foraker to the Senate  McKinley supported Foraker for Senate and Bushnell  who was of Foraker s faction  for governor  in return  the new senator elect agreed to back McKinley s presidential ambitions  With party peace in Ohio assured  McKinley turned to the national arena  81   edit  Election of 1896 Main article  United States presidential election  1896  edit  Obtaining the nomination McKinley s close friend and adviser  Mark Hanna It is unclear when William McKinley began to seriously prepare a run for president  As Phillips notes   no documents  no diaries  no confidential letters to Mark Hanna  or anyone else  contain his secret hopes or veiled stratagems   82  From its earliest days  McKinley s preparations had the participation of Hanna  whose biographer William T  Horner noted   what is certainly true that in 1888 the two men began to develop a close working relationship that helped put McKinley in the White House   83  Sherman did not run for president again after 1888  and so Hanna could support McKinley s ambitions for that office wholeheartedly  84  Backed by Hanna s money and organizational skills  McKinley quietly built support for a presidential bid through 1895 and early 1896  When other contenders  such as Speaker Reed and Iowa Senator William B  Allison sent agents outside their states to organize Republicans in support of their candidacies  they found that Hanna s agents had preceded them  According to historian Stanley Jones in his study of the 1896 election  Another feature common to the Reed and Allison campaigns was their failure to make headway against the tide which was running toward McKinley  In fact  both campaigns from the moment they were launched were in retreat  The calm confidence with which each candidate claimed the support of his own section  of the country  soon gave way to     bitter accusations that Hanna by winning support for McKinley in their sections had violated the rules of the game  85  Hanna  on McKinley s behalf  met with the eastern Republican political bosses  such as Senators Thomas Platt of New York and Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania  who were willing to guarantee McKinley s nomination in exchange for promises regarding patronage and offices  McKinley  however  was determined to obtain the nomination without making deals  and Hanna accepted that decision  86  Many of their early efforts were focused on the South Hanna obtained a vacation home in southern Georgia where McKinley visited and met with Republican politicians from the region  McKinley needed 453  delegate votes to gain the nomination  he gained nearly half that number from the South and border states  Platt lamented in his memoirs    Hanna  had the South practically solid before some of us awakened   87  The bosses still hoped to deny McKinley a first ballot majority at the convention by boosting support for local favorite son candidates such as Quay  New York Governor  and former vice president  Levi P  Morton  and Illinois Senator Shelby Cullom  Delegate rich Illinois proved a crucial battleground  as McKinley supporters  such as Chicago businessman  and future vice president  Charles G  Dawes  sought to elect delegates pledged to vote for McKinley at the national convention in St  Louis  Cullom proved unable to stand against McKinley despite the support of local Republican machines  at the state convention at the end of April  McKinley completed a near sweep of Illinois  delegates  88  Former President Harrison had been deemed a possible contender if he entered the race  when Harrison made it known he would not seek a third nomination  the McKinley organization took control of Indiana with a speed Harrison privately found unseemly  Morton operatives who journeyed to Indiana sent word back that they had found the state alive for McKinley  89 Wyoming Senator Francis Warren wrote   The politicians are making a hard fight against him  but if the masses could speak  McKinley is the choice of at least 75  of the entire  body of  Republican voters in the Union   90  By the time the national convention began in St  Louis on June 16  1896  McKinley had an ample majority of delegates  The former governor  who remained in Canton  followed events at the convention closely by telephone  and was able to hear part of Foraker s speech nominating him over the line  When Ohio was reached in the roll call of states  its votes gave McKinley the nomination  which he celebrated by hugging his wife and mother as his friends fled the house  anticipating the first of many crowds which would gather at the Republican candidate s home  Thousands of partisans came from Canton and surrounding towns that evening to hear McKinley speak from his front porch  The convention nominated Republican National Committee vice chairman Garret Hobart of New Jersey for vice president  a choice actually made  by most accounts  by Hanna  Hobart  a wealthy lawyer  businessman  and former state legislator  was not widely known  but as Hanna biographer Herbert Croly pointed out   if he did little to strengthen the ticket he did nothing to weaken it   91  92   edit  General election campaign For additional information on the currency question  see Cross of Gold speech Background  Prior to the 1896 convention  McKinley tried to avoid coming down on one side or the other of the currency question  William Allen Rogers cartoon from Harper s Weekly  June 1896  Prior to the Republican convention  McKinley had been a  straddle bug  on the currency question  favoring moderate positions on silver such as accomplishing bimetallism by international agreement  In the final days before the convention  McKinley decided  after hearing from politicians and businessmen  that the platform should endorse the gold standard  though it should allow for bimetallism by international agreement  Adoption of the platform caused some western delegates  led by Colorado Senator Henry M  Teller to walk out of the convention  However  compared with the Democrats  Republican divisions on the issue were small  especially as McKinley promised future concessions to silver advocates  93  94  95  The bad economic times had continued  and strengthened the hand of forces for free silver  The issue bitterly divided the Democratic Party  President Cleveland firmly supported the gold standard  but an increasing number of rural Democrats wanted silver  especially in the South and West  The silverites took control of the 1896 Democratic National Convention and chose William Jennings Bryan for president  he had electrified the delegates with his Cross of Gold speech  Bryan s financial radicalism shocked financiers they thought his inflationary program would bankrupt the railroads and ruin the economy  Hanna approached them with a business plan to use money to win  they gave  3 5 million  This money went for speakers and over 200 million pamphlets advocating the Republican position on the money and tariff questions  96  97  Bryan s campaign had at most  500 000  chiefly from owners of silver mines  His eloquence and youthful energy were his major assets in the race  he decided on a whistle stop political tour by train on an unprecedented scale  Hanna urged McKinley to match Bryan s tour with one of his own  the candidate declined on the ground that the Democrat was a better stump speaker   I might just as well set up a trapeze on my front lawn and compete with some professional athlete as go out speaking against Bryan  I have to think when I speak   98  Instead of going to the people  McKinley would remain at home in Canton and allow the people to come to him  according to historian R  Hal Williams in his book on the 1896 election   it was  as it turned out  a brilliant strategy  McKinley s  Front Porch Campaign  became a legend in American political history   98  William and Ida McKinley  to her husband s right  pose with members of the  Flower Delegation  from Oil City  Pennsylvania  before the McKinley home  Although women could not vote in most states  they might influence male relatives and were encouraged to visit Canton  McKinley made himself available to the public every day except Sunday  receiving delegations from the front porch of his home  The railroads subsidized the visitors with low excursion rates the pro silver Cleveland Plain Dealer disgustedly stated that going to Canton had been made  cheaper than staying at home   99  100  Delegations marched through the streets from the railroad station to McKinley s home on North Market Street  Once there  they crowded close to the front porch from which they surreptitiously whittled souvenirs as their spokesman addressed McKinley  The candidate then responded  speaking on campaign issues in a speech molded to suit the interest of the delegation  The speeches were carefully scripted to avoid extemporaneous remarks  even the spokesman s remarks were approved by McKinley or a representative  This was done as the candidate feared an offhand comment by another that might rebound on him  99  101  102   A Man of Mark  1896 Homer Davenport cartoon of McKinley as Hanna s creature  from William Randolph Hearst s New York Journal Most Democratic newspapers refused to support Bryan  the major exception being the New York Journal  controlled by William Randolph Hearst whose fortune was based on silver mines  In biased reporting and through the sharp cartoons of Homer Davenport  Hanna was viciously characterized as a plutocrat  trampling on labor  McKinley was drawn as a child  easily controlled by big business  103  Even today  these depictions still color the images of Hanna and McKinley  one as a heartless businessman  the other as a creature of Hanna and others of his ilk  104  McKinley speaks from the front porch Historic recording of William McKinley  The final 1 08 of this sound file contains an excerpt from one of his 1896 campaign speeches  Problems listening to this file  See media help  The Democrats had pamphlets too  though not as many  Jones analyzed how voters responded to the education campaigns of the two parties  For the people it was a campaign of study and analysis  of exhortation and conviction a campaign of search for economic and political truth  Pamphlets tumbled from the presses  to be read  reread  studied  debated  to become guides to economic thought and political action  They were printed and distributed by the million     but the people hankered for more  Favorite pamphlets became dog eared  grimy  fell apart as their owners laboriously restudied their arguments and quoted from them in public and private debate  105  The battleground proved to be the Midwest the South and most of the West were conceded to Bryan and the Democrat spent much of his time in those crucial states  106  107  The Northeast was considered most likely safe for McKinley after the early voting states of Maine and Vermont supported him in September  108  By then  it was clear that public support for silver had receded  and McKinley began to emphasize the tariff issue  By the end of September  the Republicans had discontinued printing material on the silver issue  and were entirely concentrating on the tariff question  109  On November 3  1896  the voters had their say in most of the nation  McKinley won the entire Northeast and Midwest  he won 51  of the vote and an ample majority in the Electoral College  Bryan had concentrated entirely on the silver issue  and had not appealed to urban workers  Voters in cities supported McKinley  the only city of more than 100 000 population carried by Bryan was Denver  Colorado  110  The 1896 presidential election is often seen as a realigning election  in which McKinley s view of a stronger central government building American industry through protective tariffs and a dollar based on gold triumphed  The voting patterns established then displaced the near deadlock the major parties had seen since the Civil War  the Republican dominance begun then would continue until 1932  another realigning election with the ascent of Franklin Roosevelt  111  Phillips argues that  with the possible exception of Iowa Senator Allison  McKinley was the only Republican who could have defeated Bryan he theorized that eastern candidates such as Morton or Reed would have done badly against the Illinois born Bryan in the crucial Midwest  112  According to the biographer  though Bryan was popular among rural voters   McKinley appealed to a very different industrialized  urbanized America

McKinley was sworn in as president on March 4  1897  as his wife and mother looked on  The new President gave a lengthy inaugural address  he urged tariff reform  and stated that the currency issue would have to await tariff legislation  He warned against foreign interventions   We want no wars of conquest  We must avoid the temptation of territorial aggression   114  McKinley s most controversial Cabinet appointment was that of John Sherman as Secretary of State  115  Sherman was not McKinley s first choice for the position  he initially offered it to Senator Allison  115  One consideration in Senator Sherman s appointment was to provide a Senate place for Hanna  who had turned down a Cabinet position as Postmaster General   As Sherman had served as Secretary of the Treasury under Hayes  only the State position  the leading Cabinet post  was likely to entice him from the Senate  Sherman s mental faculties were decaying even in 1896  this was widely spoken of in political circles  but McKinley did not believe the rumors  115  Nevertheless  McKinley sent his cousin  William McKinley Osborne  to have dinner with the 73 year old senator  he reported back that Sherman seemed as lucid as ever  116  McKinley wrote once the appointment was announced   the stories regarding Senator Sherman s  mental decay  are without foundation     When I saw him last I was convinced both of his perfect health  physically and mentally  and that the prospects of life were remarkably good   116  After some difficulties  Ohio Governor Bushnell appointed Hanna to the Senate  117  Once in Cabinet office  Sherman s mental incapacity became increasingly apparent  He was often bypassed by his first assistant  McKinley s Canton crony Judge William Day  and by the somewhat deaf second secretary  Alvey A  Adee  Day  an Ohio lawyer unfamiliar with diplomacy  was often reticent in meetings  One diplomat characterized the arrangement   the head of the department knew nothing  the first assistant said nothing  and the second assistant heard nothing   116  President McKinley and his cabinet Maine Congressman Nelson Dingley  Jr  was McKinley s choice for Secretary of the Treasury  he declined it  preferring to remain as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee  Charles Dawes  who had been Hanna s lieutenant in Chicago during the campaign  was considered for the Treasury post but by some accounts Dawes felt he was too young  Dawes eventually became Comptroller of the Currency  he recorded in his published diary that he had strongly urged McKinley to appoint the successful candidate as secretary  Lyman J  Gage  president of the First National Bank of Chicago  118  The Navy Department was offered to former Massachusetts Congressman John Davis Long  an old friend from the House  on January 30  1897  119  Although McKinley was initially inclined to allow Long to choose his own assistant  there was considerable pressure on the President elect to appoint Theodore Roosevelt  head of the New York City Police Commission and a former state assemblyman  McKinley was reluctant  stating to one Roosevelt booster   I want peace and I am told that your friend Theodore is always getting into rows with everybody   Nevertheless  he made the appointment  120  Video clip of McKinley s inauguration in 1897 In addition to Sherman  McKinley made one other Cabinet appointment which proved ill advised  121  that of Secretary of War  which fell to former General and Michigan Governor Russell A  Alger  Competent enough in peacetime  Alger proved inadequate once the conflict against Spain began  With the War Department plagued by scandal  Alger resigned at McKinley s request in mid 1899  122  Vice President Hobart  as was customary at the time  was not invited to Cabinet meetings  However  he proved a valuable adviser both for McKinley and for his Cabinet members  The wealthy Vice President leased a residence close to the White House  the two families visited each other without formality  and the Vice President s wife  Jennie Tuttle Hobart  sometimes substituted as Executive Mansion hostess when Ida McKinley was not well  123  For most of McKinley s administration  George B  Cortelyou served as his personal secretary  Cortelyou  who served in three Cabinet positions under Theodore Roosevelt  became a combination press secretary and chief of staff to McKinley  124   edit  War with Spain For decades  rebels in Cuba had waged an intermittent campaign for freedom from Spanish colonial rule  By 1895  the conflict had expanded to a war for Cuban independence  125  As war engulfed the island  Spanish reprisals against the rebels grew ever harsher  These included the removal of Cubans to reconcentration camps near Spanish military bases  a strategy designed to make it hard for the rebels to receive support in the countryside  126  American opinion favored the rebels  and McKinley shared in their outrage against Spanish policies  127  As many of his countrymen called for war to liberate Cuba  McKinley favored a peaceful approach  hoping that through negotiation Spain might be convinced to grant Cuba independence  or at least to allow the Cubans some measure of autonomy  128  The United States and Spain began negotiations on the subject in 1897  but it became clear that Spain would never concede Cuban independence  while the rebels  and their American supporters  would never settle for anything less  129  In January 1898  Spain promised some concessions to the rebels  but when American consul Fitzhugh Lee reported riots in Havana  McKinley agreed to send the battleship USS Maine there to protect American lives and property  130  On February 15  the Maine exploded and sunk with 266 men killed  131  Public opinion and the newspapers demanded war  but McKinley insisted that a court of inquiry first determine if the explosion was accidental  132  Negotiations with Spain continued as the court considered the evidence  but on March 20  the court ruled that the Maine was blown up by an underwater mine  133  As pressure for war mounted in Congress  McKinley continued to negotiate for Cuban independence  134  Spain refused McKinley s proposals  and on April 11  McKinley turned the matter over to Congress  He did not ask for war  but Congress anyway declared war on April 20  with the addition of the Teller Amendment which disavowed any intention of annexing Cuba  135  Editorial cartoon intervention in Cuba  Columbia  the American people  reaches out to help oppressed Cuba in 1897 while Uncle Sam

greater control over the day to day management of the war than previous presidents had enjoyed  and he used the new technologies to direct the army s and navy s movements as far as he was able  136  McKinley found Alger inadequate as Secretary of War  and did not get along with the Army s commanding general  Nelson A  Miles  137  Bypassing them  he looked for strategic advice first from Miles s predecessor  General John Schofield  and later from Adjutant General Henry Clarke Corbin  137  The war also led to a change in McKinley s cabinet  as the President accepted Sherman s resignation as Secretary of State  Day agreed to serve as Secretary until the war s end  138  Within a fortnight  the navy had its first victory when the Asiatic Squadron  led by Commodore George Dewey  engaged the Spanish navy at the Battle of Manila Bay in the Philippines  destroying the enemy force without the loss of a single American vessel  139  Dewey s overwhelming victory expanded the scope of the war from one centered in the Caribbean to one that would determine the fate of all of Spain s Pacific colonies  140  The next month  McKinley increased the number of troops to be sent to the Philippines and granted the force s commander  Major General Wesley Merritt  the power to set up legal systems and raise taxes necessities for a long occupation  141  By the time the troops arrived in the Philippines at the end of June 1898  McKinley had decided that Spain would be required to surrender the archipelago to the United States  142  He professed to be open to all views on the subject  however  he believed that as the war progressed  the public would come to demand retention of the islands as a prize of war  143  Meanwhile  in the Caribbean theater  a large force of regulars and volunteers gathered near Tampa  Florida  for an invasion of Cuba  144  The army faced difficulties in supplying the rapidly expanding force even before they departed for Cuba  but by June  Corbin had made progress in resolving the problems  145  After lengthy delays  the army  led by Major General William Rufus Shafter  sailed from Florida on June 20  landing near Santiago de Cuba two days later  146  Following a skirmish at Las Guasimas on June 24  Shafter s army engaged the Spanish forces on July 2 in the Battle of San Juan Hill  147  In an intense day long battle  the American force was victorious  although both sides suffered heavy causalities  148  The next day  the Spanish Caribbean squadron  which had been sheltering in Santiago s harbor  broke for the open sea but was intercepted and destroyed by Rear Admiral William T  Sampson s North Atlantic Squadron in the largest naval battle of the war  149  Shafter laid siege to the city of Santiago  which surrendered on July 17  placing Cuba in effective American control  150  McKinley and Miles also ordered an invasion of Puerto Rico  which met little resistance when it landed in July  150  The distance from Spain and the destruction of the Spanish navy made resupply impossible  and the Spanish government began to look for a way to end the war  151   edit  Peace and territorial gain Signing of the Treaty of Paris On July 22  the Spanish authorized Jules Cambon  the French Ambassador to the United States  to represent Spain in negotiating peace  151  The Spanish initially wished to restrict the discussion to Cuba  but were quickly forced to recognize that their other possessions were to be claimed as spoils of war  151  McKinley s cabinet agreed with him that Spain must leave Cuba and Puerto Rico  but they disagreed on the Philippines  with some wishing to annex the entire archipelago and some wishing only to retain a naval base in the area  152  Although public sentiment seemed to favor annexation of the Philippines  several prominent political leaders  including Bryan  ex President Cleveland  and the newly formed American Anti Imperialist League made their opposition known  153  McKinley proposed to open negotiations with Spain on the basis of Cuban liberation and Puerto Rican annexation  with the final status of the Philippines to be subject to further discussion  154  He stood firmly in that demand even as the military situation on Cuba began to deteriorate when the American army was struck with yellow fever  154  Spain ultimately agreed to a ceasefire on those terms on August 12  and treaty negotiations began in Paris in September 1898  155  The talks continued until December 18  when the Treaty of Paris was signed  156  The United States acquired Puerto Rico and the Philippines as well as the island of Guam  and Spain relinquished its claims to Cuba  in exchange  the United States agreed to pay Spain  20 million  156  McKinley had difficulty convincing the Senate to approve the treaty by the requisite two thirds vote  but his lobbying  and that of Vice President Hobart  eventually saw success  as the Senate voted in favor on February 6  1899  57 to 27  157  During the war  McKinley also pursued the annexation of the Republic of Hawaii  The new republic  dominated by American interests  had seized power from the royal government in 1893  158  The lame duck Harrison administration had submitted a treaty of annexation to the Senate  Cleveland  once he returned to office  had sent a special commission to the islands  After receiving the report  Cleveland withdrew the treaty  stating that the revolution did not reflect the will of Hawaiian citizens  159  Nevertheless  many Americans favored annexation  and the cause gained momentum as the United States became embroiled in war with Spain  160  McKinley came to office as a supporter of annexation  and lobbied Congress to adopt his opinion  believing that to do nothing would invite a royalist counter revolution or a Japanese takeover  160  Foreseeing difficulty in getting two thirds of the Senate to approve a treaty of annexation  McKinley instead supported the effort of Democratic Representative Francis G  Newlands of Nevada to accomplish the result by joint resolution of both houses of Congress  161  The resulting Newlands Resolution passed both houses by wide margins  and McKinley signed it into law on July 8  1898  161  McKinley biographer H  Wayne Morgan notes   McKinley was the guiding spirit behind the annexation of Hawaii  showing     a firmness in pursuing it   162  the President told Cortelyou   We need Hawaii just as much and a good deal more than we did California  It is manifest destiny   163 Wake Island  an uninhabited atoll between Hawaii and Guam  was claimed for the United States on July 12  1898  164   edit  Expanding influence overseas In acquiring of Pacific possessions for the United States  McKinley expanded the nation s ability to compete for trade in China  165  Even before peace negotiations began with Spain  McKinley asked Congress to set up a commission to examine trade opportunities in the region and espoused an  Open Door Policy   in which all nations would freely trade with China and none would seek to violate that nation s territorial integrity  166  When John Hay replaced Day as Secretary of State at the end of the war  he circulated notes to that effect to the European powers  167  Great Britain favored the idea  but Russia opposed it  France  Germany  Italy and Japan agreed in principle  but only if all the other nations signed on  167  Trade with China became imperiled shortly thereafter as the Boxer Rebellion menaced foreigners and their property in China  168  Americans and other westerners in Peking were besieged and  in cooperation with other western powers  McKinley ordered 5000 troops to the city in June 1900 in the China Relief Expedition  169  The westerners were liberated the next month  but several Congressional Democrats objected to McKinley dispatching troops without consulting the legislature  168  McKinley s actions set a precedent that led to most of his successors exerting similar independent control over the military  169  After the rebellion ended  the United States reaffirmed its commitment to the Open Door policy  which became the basis of American policy toward China  170  Closer to home  McKinley and Hay engaged in negotiations with Britain over the possible construction of a canal across Central America  The Clayton Bulwer Treaty  which the two nations signed in 1850  prohibited either from establishing exclusive control over a canal there  The war had exposed the difficulty of maintaining a two ocean navy without a connection closer than Cape Horn  171  Now  with American business and military interests even more involved in Asia  a canal seemed more essential than ever  and McKinley pressed for a renegotiation of the treaty  171  Hay and the British ambassador  Julian Pauncefote  agreed that the United States could control a future canal  provided that it was open to all shipping and not fortified  172  McKinley was satisfied with the terms  but the Senate rejected them  demanding that the United States be allowed to fortify the canal  172  Hay was embarrassed by the rebuff and offered his resignation  but McKinley refused it and ordered him to continue negotiations to achieve the Senate s demands  172  He was successful  and a new treaty was drafted and approved  but not before McKinley s assassination in 1901  172   edit  Tariffs and bimetallism 1900 reelection poster celebrates McKinley standing tall on the gold standard with support from soldiers  sailors  businessmen  factory workers and professionals  Two of the great issues of the day  tariff reform and free silver  became intertwined in 1897  173  Ways and Means chairman Dingley introduced a new tariff bill  later called the Dingley Act  to revise the Wilson Gorman Tariff Act of 1894  173  McKinley supported the bill  which increased tariffs on wool  sugar  and luxury goods  but the proposed new rates alarmed the French  who exported many luxury items to the United States  173  The Dingley Act passed the House easily  but was delayed in the Senate as they assessed the French objections  174  French representatives offered to cooperate with the United States in developing an international agreement on bimetallism if the new tariff rates were reduced  this pleased silverite Republicans in the Senate  whose votes were necessary for passage  175  The Senate amended the bill to allow limited reciprocity  giving France some possibility of relief   but did not reduce the rates on luxury goods  176  McKinley signed the bill into law and agreed to begin negotiations on an international bimetallism standard  177  American negotiators soon concluded a reciprocity treaty with France  and the two nations approached Britain to gauge British enthusiasm for bimetallism  177  The Prime Minister  Lord Salisbury  and his government showed some interest in the idea and told the American envoy  Edward O  Wolcott  that he would be amenable to reopening the mints in India to silver coinage if the British dominated government there agreed  178  News of a possible departure from the gold standard stirred up immediate opposition from its partisans  and misgivings by the Indian administration led Britain to reject the proposal  178  With the international effort a failure  McKinley turned away from silver coinage and embraced the gold standard  179  Even without the agreement  agitation for free silver eased as prosperity began to return to the United States and gold from recent strikes in the Yukon and Australia increased the monetary supply even without silver coinage  180  In the absence of international agreement  McKinley favored legislation to formally affirm the gold standard  but was initially deterred by the silver strength in the Senate  181  By 1900  with another campaign ahead and good economic conditions  McKinley urged Congress to pass such a law  and was able to sign the Gold Standard Act on March 14  1900  using a gold pen to do so  182   edit  Judicial appointments Main article  List of federal judges appointed by William McKinley After the retirement of Justice Stephen Johnson Field  McKinley appointed Attorney General Joseph McKenna to the Supreme Court of the United States in December 1897  183  The appointment aroused some controversy as McKenna s critics in the Senate said he was too closely associated with railroad interests and lacked the qualifications of a Supreme Court justice  184  Despite the objections  McKenna s nomination was approved unanimously  185  McKenna responded to the criticism of his legal education by taking some courses at Columbia Law School for several months before taking his seat  184  Along with his Supreme Court appointment  McKinley appointed six judges to the United States Courts of Appeals  and 28 judges to the United States district courts  186   edit  Civil rights In the wake of McKinley s election in 1896  African Americans were hopeful of progress towards equality  McKinley had spoken out against lynching while governor  and most African Americans who could vote supported him in 1896  McKinley s priority  however  was in ending sectionalism  and they were disappointed by his policies and appointments  Although McKinley made some appointments of African Americans to low level government posts  and received some praise for that  the appointments were less than they had received under previous Republican administrations  Blanche K  Bruce  an African American who during Reconstruction had served as senator from Mississippi  received the post of register at the Treasury Department  this post was traditionally given to an African American by Republican presidents  McKinley appointed several black postmasters  however  when whites protested the appointment of Justin W  Lyons as postmaster of Augusta  Georgia  McKinley asked Lyons to withdraw  he was given the post of Treasury register after Bruce s death in 1898  187  The President did appoint George B  Jackson  a former slave  to the post of customs collector in Presidio  Texas  188  However  African Americans in northern states felt their contributions to McKinley s victory were overlooked  few were appointed to office  187  The administration s response to racial violence was minimal  causing him to lose black support  187  When black postmasters at Hogansville  Georgia in 1897 and at Lake City  South Carolina the following year were assaulted  McKinley issued no statement of condemnation  Although black leaders criticized McKinley for inaction  supporters responded there was little the president could do to intervene  Critics replied that he could at least publicly condemn such events  as Harrison had done  189  McKinley   right of

190  African Americans saw the onset of war in 1898 as an opportunity to display their patriotism  and black soldiers fought bravely at El Caney and San Juan Hill  African Americans in the peacetime Army had formed elite units  nevertheless they were harassed by whites as they traveled from the West to Tampa for embarkation to the war  Under pressure from black leaders  McKinley required the War Department to commission black officers above the rank of lieutenant  The heroism of the black troops did not still racial tensions in the South  as the second half of 1898 saw several outbreaks of racial violence  11 African Americans were killed in riots in Wilmington  North Carolina  191  McKinley toured the South in late 1898  hoping for sectional reconciliation  In addition to visiting Tuskegee Institute and black educator Booker T  Washington  he addressed the Georgia legislature  wearing a badge of gray  and visited Confederate memorials  In his tour of the South  McKinley did not mention the racial tensions or violence  Although the President received a rapturous reception from Southern whites  many African Americans  excluded from official welcoming committees  felt alienated by the President s words and actions  191  192  According to Gould and later biographer Phillips  given the political climate in the South  with white legislatures passing segregationist laws such as that upheld in Plessy v  Ferguson  there was little McKinley could have done to improve race relations  and he did better than later presidents Theodore Roosevelt  who doubted racial equality  and Woodrow Wilson  who supported segregation  However  Gould concluded   McKinley lacked the vision to transcend the biases of his day and to point toward a better future for all Americans   193   edit  1900 election McKinley ran on his record of prosperity and victory in 1900  winning easy re election over Bryan  Main article  United States presidential election  1900 Republicans were generally successful in state and local elections around the country in 1899  and McKinley was optimistic about his chances at re election in 1900  194  McKinley s popularity in his first term assured him of renomination for a second  195  The only question about the Republican ticket concerned the vice presidential nomination  McKinley needed a new running mate as Hobart had died in late 1899  196  McKinley initially favored Elihu Root  who had succeeded Alger as Secretary of War  but McKinley decided that Root was doing too good a job at the War Department to move him  196  He considered other prominent candidates  including Allison and Cornelius N  Bliss  but none were as popular as the Republican party s rising star  Theodore Roosevelt  197  After a stint as Assistant Secretary of the Navy  Roosevelt had resigned and raised a cavalry regiment  they fought bravely in Cuba  and Roosevelt returned home covered in glory  Elected governor of New York on a reform platform in 1898  Roosevelt had his eye on the presidency  196  Many supporters recommended him to McKinley for the second spot on the ticket  and Roosevelt believed it would be an excellent stepping stone to the presidency in 1904  196  McKinley remained uncommitted in public  but Hanna was firmly opposed to the New York governor  198  The Ohio senator considered the New Yorker overly impulsive  his stance was undermined by the efforts of political boss and New York Senator Thomas Platt  who  disliking Roosevelt s reform agenda  sought to sideline the governor by making him vice president  199  When the Republican convention began in Philadelphia that June  no vice presidential candidate had overwhelming support  but Roosevelt had the broadest range of support from around the country  196  McKinley affirmed that the choice belonged to the convention  not to him  200  On June 21  McKinley was unanimously renominated and  with Hanna s reluctant acquiescence  Roosevelt was nominated for vice president on the first ballot  201  The Democratic convention convened the next month in Kansas City and nominated William Jennings Bryan  setting up a rematch of the 1896 contest  202  The candidates were the same  but the issues of the campaign had shifted  free silver was still a question that animated many voters  but the Republicans focused on victory in war and prosperity at home as issues they believed favored their party  203  Democrats knew the war had been popular  even if the imperialism issue was less sure  so they focused on the issue of trusts and corporate power  painting McKinley as the servant of capital and big business  204  As in 1896  Bryan embarked on a speaking tour around the country while McKinley stayed at home  this time making only one speech  to accept his nomination  205  Roosevelt emerged as the campaign s primary speaker and Hanna helped the cause working to settle a coal miners strike in Pennsylvania  206  Bryan s campaigning failed to excite the voters as it had in 1896  and McKinley never doubted that he would be re elected  207  On November 6  1900  he was proven correct  winning the largest victory for any Republican since 1872  208  Bryan carried only four states outside the solid South  and McKinley even won Bryan s home state of Nebraska  208   edit  Second term and assassination Main article  Assassination of William McKinley Artist s conception of the shooting of McKinley Soon after his second inauguration on March 4  1901  William and Ida McKinley undertook a six week tour of the nation  Traveling mostly by rail  the McKinleys were to travel through the South to the Southwest  and then up the Pacific coast and east again  to conclude with a visit on June 13  1901 to the Pan American Exposition in Buffalo  New York  209  However  the First Lady fell ill in California  causing her husband to limit his public events and cancel a series of speeches he had planned to give urging trade reciprocity  He also postponed the visit to the fair until September  planning a month in Washington and two in Canton before the Buffalo visit  210  Although McKinley enjoyed meeting the public  Cortelyou was concerned with his security  and twice tried to remove a public reception from the President s rescheduled visit to the Exposition  McKinley refused  and Cortelyou arranged for additional security for the trip  211  On September 5  the President delivered his address at the fairgrounds  before a crowd of some 50 000 people  In his final speech  McKinley urged reciprocity treaties with other nations to assure American manufacturers foreign markets  He intended the speech as a keynote to his plans for a second term  212  213  One man in the crowd  anarchist Leon Czolgosz  hoped to assassinate McKinley  He had managed to get close to the presidential podium  but did not fire  uncertain of hitting his target  212  Czolgosz  since hearing a speech by fellow anarchist Emma Goldman in Cleveland  had decided to do something heroic  in his own mind  for the cause  He had initially decided to get near McKinley  on September 4  he decided to assassinate him  214  After the failure on the 5th  Czolgosz waited the next day at the Temple of Music on the Exposition grounds  where the President was to meet the public after his return from the falls  The anarchist concealed his gun in a handkerchief  and when he reached the head of the line  shot McKinley twice in the abdomen  215  McKinley s concerns  after unsuccessfully trying to convince Cortelyou that he was not seriously wounded  were to urge his aides to break the news gently to Ida  and to call off the mob which had set on Czolgosz a request that may have saved his assassin s life  216  McKinley was taken by electric ambulance to the Exposition hospital  which despite its name and the inclusion of an operating theatre generally only dealt with the minor medical issues of fairgoers  One bullet had apparently been deflected by a button and only grazed the President  Cortelyou selected Dr  Matthew D  Mann from the doctors who hastened to the scene  he had little experience in abdominal surgery or in dealing with gunshot wounds and proved unable to locate the other bullet  Although a primitive X ray machine was being exhibited on the Exposition grounds  it was not used  and Mann carefully cleaned and closed the wound  After the operation  McKinley was taken to the Milburn House  where the First Lady had taken the news calmly  217  In the days after the shooting McKinley appeared to improve  Doctors issued increasingly cheerful bulletins  Members of the Cabinet  who had rushed to Buffalo on hearing the news dispersed  Vice President Roosevelt departed on a camping trip to the Adirondacks   218  Leech wrote  It is difficult to interpret the optimism with which the President s physicians looked for his recovery  There was obviously the most serious danger that his wounds would become septic  In that case  he would almost certainly die  since drugs to control infection did not exist      Prominent New York City physician  Dr  McBurney was by far the worst offender in showering sanguine assurances on the correspondents  As the only big city surgeon on the case  he was eagerly questioned and quoted  and his rosy prognostications largely contributed to the delusion of the American public  219  By September 12  McKinley s doctors were confident enough of his condition to allow him toast and coffee  He proved unable to digest the food  unknown to the doctors  the gangrene which would kill him was growing on the walls of his stomach  slowly poisoning his blood  On the morning of September 13  McKinley took a turn for the worse and became critically ill  Frantic word was sent to the Vice President  who was 12 miles  19 km  from the nearest telegraph station or telephone  By the evening  McKinley roused from a stupor and realized his condition   It is useless  gentlemen  I think we ought to have prayer   220  Relatives and friends gathered around the dying man s bed as Ida McKinley sobbed over him  stating that she wanted to go with him   We are all going  we are all going   her husband replied   God s will be done  not ours   220  By some accounts  those were his final words  he may also have sung part of his favorite hymn   Nearer  My God  to Thee   Sometime that evening  Mark Hanna approached the bedside  The senator addressed McKinley as  Mr  President   when he received no intelligible response  he abandoned formality and cried out to his friend   William  William  don t you know me   220  At 2 15 a m  on September 14  1901  President McKinley died  220  Theodore Roosevelt was hastily returning to Buffalo by horseback and rail  that afternoon he took the oath of office as president in Buffalo at the house of his friend Ansley Wilcox  wearing borrowed formal clothing and pledging to carry out McKinley s political agenda  221  Czolgosz  put on trial for murder nine days after McKinley s death  was found guilty  sentenced to death on September 26  and was executed by electric chair on October 29  1901  222   edit  Funeral  memorials  and legacy  edit  Funeral and resting place McKinley s tomb in Canton According to Gould   The nation experienced a wave of genuine grief at the news of McKinley s passing   223  The stock market  faced with sudden uncertainty  suffered a steep decline  this was almost unnoticed in the mourning  The nation s attention was focused on the casket which made its way by train first to Washington  where it first lay in the East Room of the Executive Mansion and then in state in the Capitol  and then to Canton  224  A hundred thousand people passed by the open casket in the Capitol Rotunda  many having waited hours in the rain  in Canton  an equal number did the same at the Stark County Courthouse on September 18  The following day  a funeral service was held at the First Methodist Church  the casket was then sealed and taken to the McKinley house  where relatives paid their final respects  225  It was then transported to the receiving vault at West Lawn Cemetery in Canton  to await the construction of the memorial to McKinley already being planned  226  There was a widespread expectation that Ida McKinley would not long survive her husband  one family friend stated  as William McKinley lay dying  that they should be prepared for a double funeral  227  This did not occur  the former first lady accompanied her husband on the funeral train  Leech noted  the circuitous journey was a cruel ordeal for the woman who huddled in a compartment of the funeral train  praying that the Lord would take her with her Dearest Love   228  She was not able to attend the services in Washington or Canton  though she listened at the door to the service for her husband in her house on North Market Street  She remained in Canton for the remainder of her life  setting up a shrine in her house  and often visiting the receiving vault  until her death at age 59 on May 26  1907  227  She died only months before the completion of the large marble monument to her husband in Canton  which was dedicated by President Roosevelt on September 30  1907  William and Ida McKinley rest there with their daughters  atop a hillside overlooking the city of Canton  229   edit  Other memorials McKinley memorial by Hermon MacNeil in front of the Ohio Statehouse  Columbus In addition to the Canton site  for which over a million school children donated money  there are many memorials to William McKinley  There is a monument at his birthplace in Niles  20 Ohio schools bear his name  230  Phillips suggests the significant number of major memorials to McKinley in Ohio reflected the expectation among Ohioans in the years after McKinley s death that he would be ranked among the great presidents  231  Statues to him may be found in more than a dozen states  his name has been bestowed on streets  civic organizations  and libraries  Mount McKinley in central Alaska is named for the former president  its summit  at 20 320 feet  6 190 m   is the highest point in North America  Until its name was changed to Denali National Park  the park which surrounds it was known as Mount McKinley National Park  230   edit  Legacy and historical image McKinley s biographer  H  Wayne Morgan remarks that McKinley died the most beloved president in history  232  However  the young  enthusiastic Roosevelt quickly captured public attention after his predecessor s death  The new president made little effort to secure the trade reciprocity McKinley had intended to negotiate with other nations  Controversy and public interest surrounded Roosevelt throughout the seven and a half years of his presidency as memories of McKinley faded  by 1920  according to Gould  McKinley s administration was deemed no more than  a mediocre prelude to the vigor and energy of Theodore Roosevelt s   223  Beginning in the 1950s  McKinley received more favorable evaluations  nevertheless  in surveys ranking American presidents  he has generally been placed near the middle  often trailing contemporaries such as Hayes and Cleveland  223  Morgan suggests that this relatively low ranking is due to a perception among historians that while many decisions during McKinley s presidency profoundly affected the nation s future  he more followed public opinion than led it  and that McKinley s standing has suffered from altered public expectations of the presidency  233  There has been broad agreement among historians that McKinley s election was at the time of a transition between two political eras  dubbed the Third and Fourth Party Systems  234  Historian Daniel P  Klinghard argued that McKinley s personal control of the 1896 campaign gave him the opportunity to reshape the presidency rather than simply follow the party platform by representing himself as the voice of the people  235  However  more recently  as Republican political official Karl Rove exalted McKinley as the agent of sweeping political realignment in the 2000s  some scholars  such as David Mayhew  questioned whether the 1896 election truly represented a realignment  thereby placing in issue whether McKinley deserves credit for it  236  Historian Michael J  Korzi argued in 2005 that while it is tempting to see McKinley as the key figure in the transition from congressional domination of government to the modern  powerful president  this change was an incremental process through the late 19th and early 20th centuries  237  McKinley on the 25 cent value of the Presidential Issue of U S  stamps  released in 1938 Phillips writes that McKinley s low rating is undeserved  and that he should be ranked just after the great presidents such as Washington and Lincoln  He pointed to McKinley s success in building an electoral coalition which would keep the Republicans mostly in power for a generation  238  Phillips believes a McKinley legacy to be the men whom he made a part of his administration  and who dominated the Republican Party for a quarter century after his death  These officials included Cortelyou  who served in three Cabinet positions under Roosevelt  Dawes  who became vice president under Coolidge  William Howard Taft  who succeeded Roosevelt as president  and Day  who was elevated to the Supreme Court by Roosevelt and remained there almost twenty years  239  Phillips notes that  for the first time after a president s death in office  his Cabinet was not mostly replaced within a year  but instead served well into the successor s time in office  121  A controversial aspect of McKinley s presidency is territorial expansion and the question of imperialism with the exception of the Philippines  granted independence in 1946  the United States retains the territories taken under McKinley  240  The territorial expansion of 1898 is often seen by historians as the beginning of American empire  241  Morgan sees that historical discussion as a subset of the debate over the rise of America as a world power  242  The decision in 1898 1899 to annex these lands also involved issues of race  with many Democrats and some Republicans reluctant to see more non whites incorporated into the United States  this has affected studies of McKinley s decision ever since  243  Morgan expects the debate over McKinley s actions to continue indefinitely without resolution  and notes that however one judges McKinley s actions in American expansion  one of his motivations was to change the lives of Filipinos and Cubans for the better  242  Morgan alludes to the rise of interest in McKinley as part of the debate over the more assertive American foreign policy of recent decades  McKinley was a major actor in some of the most important events in American history  His decisions shaped future policies and public attitudes  He usually rises in the estimation of scholars who study his life in detail  Even those who disagree with his policies and decisions see him as an active  responsible  informed participant in charge of decision making  His dignified demeanor and subtle operations keep him somewhat remote from public perception  But he is once again at the center of events  where he started  244   edit  See also Bibliography on William McKinley United States Army
