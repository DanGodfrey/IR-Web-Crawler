the United States  established in 1919  It has a long  complex history that is closely related to the histories of similar communist parties worldwide and the U S  labor movement  For the first half of the 20th century  the CPUSA was the largest and most influential communist party in the United States  It played a very prominent role in the U S  labor movement from the 1920s through the 1940s  having a major hand in founding most of the country s first industrial unions  which would later expel communists by adopting the Smith Act  while also becoming known for opposing racism and fighting for integration in workplaces and communities during the height of the Jim Crow period of U S  racial segregation  Historian Ellen Schrecker concludes that decades of recent scholarship 2  offers a  nuanced portrayal of the party as both a Stalinist sect tied to a vicious regime and the most dynamic organization within the American Left during the 1930s and  40s   3  In regards to the former charge  the CPUSA  claiming proletarian internationalism  while the U S  Government called it espionage   sponsored an elaborate intelligence network on behalf of the Soviet Union  involving over 500 members acting as agents  The most prominent example dealt with the Manhattan Project in which the network was accused in giving the blueprints of the atomic bomb to the Soviets  Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were thereafter convicted and executed as the chief architects of this plan  Subsequent examination of the trial record shows the testimony directly tying the Rosenbergs to the atomic blueprints was conflicted and possibly false  4  By August 1919  only months after its founding  the CPUSA had 60 000 members  including anarchists and other radical leftists  while the more moderate Socialist Party of America had only 40 000 members  The sections of the CP s International Workers Order meanwhile organized for communism around linguistic and ethnic lines  providing mutual aid and tailored cultural activities to an IWO membership that peaked at 200 000 at its height  But the CP s early labor and organizing successes did not last  As the decades progressed  the combined effects of the second Red Scare  McCarthyism  Nikita Khrushchev s 1956 Secret Speech denouncing the previous decades of Joseph Stalin s rule  and the adversities of the continued Cold War mentality  steadily weakened the Communist Party s internal structure and confidence  CPUSA s membership in the Comintern and its close adherence to the political positions of the Soviet Union enabled anti communist critics to constantly present the party as not only a threatening  subversive domestic entity  but also as a  foreign  agent fundamentally alien to the  American way of life   Internal and external crises swirled together  to the point where members who did not end up in prison for party activities tended either to disappear quietly from its ranks or to adopt more moderate political positions at odds with the CPUSA s party line  By 1957  membership had dwindled to less than 10 000  of whom some 1 500 were FBI informants  5  The party attempted to recover with its opposition to the Vietnam War during the U S  Civil rights movement in the 1960s  but the continued uncritical support of the CPUSA for an increasingly stultified and militaristic Soviet Union increasingly alienated them from the rest of the U S  left  who saw this supportive position as outdated and even dangerous  At the same time  the party s aging membership demographics and noticeably hollow calls for  peaceful coexistence  failed to speak to a new Left in the United States  With the rise of Mikhail Gorbachev and his effort to radically alter the Soviet economic and political system from the mid 1980s  the CPUSA finally became estranged from the leadership of the Soviet Union itself  the USSR cut off major funding to the CPUSA in 1989 due to the CP s opposition to glasnost and perestroika  With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991  the party held its convention and attempted to resolve the issue of whether the Party should reject Marxism Leninism  The majority reasserted the party s now purely Marxist outlook  prompting a minority faction which urged social democrats to exit the now reduced party  The CPUSA is based in New York City  For decades  its West Coast newspaper was the People s World  and its East Coast newspaper was The Daily World  6  The two newspapers merged in 1986  Political Affairs Magazine is a monthly magazine  International Publishers is its publishing

Labor Party Alfred Wagenknecht  See also  Communist Labor Party The Comintern was not happy with two communist parties and in January  1920 dispatched an order that the two parties  which consisted of about 12 000 members  merge under the name United Communist Party  and to follow the party line established in Moscow  Part of the Communist Party of America under the leadership of Charles Ruthenberg and Jay Lovestone did this but a faction under the leadership of Nicholas I  Hourwich and Alexander Bittelman continued to operate independently as the Communist Party of America  A more strongly worded directive from the Comintern eventually did the trick and the parties were merged in May  1921  Only five percent of the members of the newly formed party were native English speakers  Many of the members came from the ranks of the Industrial Workers of the World  7  page needed  8  The first US socialist political party was the Socialist Labor Party  formed in 1876 and for many years a viable force in the international socialist movement  By the mid 1890s  however  the SLP came under the influence of Daniel De Leon  and his radical views led to widespread discontent amongst the members  leading to the formation of the reformist oriented Socialist Party of America around the turn of the 20th century 3  A left wing gradually emerged within the SP  much to the consternation of many Party leaders  In January 1919  Vladimir Lenin invited the left wing of the Socialist Party of America to join Comintern  During the spring of 1919 the Left Wing Caucus of the Socialist Party  buoyed by a large influx of new members from countries involved in the Russian Revolution  prepared to wrest control from the smaller controlling faction of moderate socialists  A referendum to join Comintern passed with 90  support  but the incumbent leadership suppressed the results  Elections for the party s National Executive Committee resulted in 12 leftists being elected out of a total of 15  Calls were made to expel moderates from the party  The moderate incumbents struck back by expelling several state organizations  half a dozen language federations  and many locals  in all two thirds of the membership  The Socialist Party then called an emergency convention on August 30  1919  The party s Left Wing Caucus made plans at a June conference of its own to regain control of the party  by sending delegations from the sections of the party that had been expelled to the convention to demand that they be seated  However  the language federations  eventually joined by C E  Ruthenberg and Louis C  Fraina  turned away from that effort and formed their own party  the Communist Party of America  at a separate convention on September 1  1919  Meanwhile plans led by John Reed and Benjamin Gitlow to crash the Socialist Party convention went ahead  Tipped off  the incumbents called the police  who obligingly expelled the leftists from the hall  The remaining leftist delegates walked out and  meeting with the expelled delegates  formed the Communist Labor Party on August 30  1919  7  page needed   edit  The Red Scare and the communist party  1919 1923  From its inception  the Communist Party USA came under attack from state and federal governments and later the Federal Bureau of Investigation  In 1919  after a series of unattributed bombings and attempted assassinations of government officials  and judges  later traced to militant Galleanist adherents of radical anarchist Luigi Galleani   the US Department of Justice headed by Attorney General A  Mitchell Palmer  acting under the Sedition Act of 1918  began arresting thousands of foreign born party members  many of whom the government deported  The Communist Party was forced underground and took to the use of pseudonyms and secret meetings in an effort to evade the authorities  The party apparatus was to a great extent underground  It re emerged in the last days of 1921 as a legal political party called the Workers Party of America  As the red scare and deportations of the early 1920s ebbed  the party became bolder and more open  An element of the party  however  remained permanently underground and came to be known as the  CPUSA secret apparatus   During this time  immigrants from Eastern Europe are said to have played a very prominent role in the CPUSA  9  A majority of the members of the Socialist Party were immigrants and that an  overwhelming  percentage of the CPUSA consisted of recent immigrants  10   edit  The factional war  1923 1929  Executive Secretary C E  Ruthenberg  1924  Now that the above ground element was legal  the communists decided that their central task was to develop roots within the working class  This move away from hopes of revolution in the near future to a more nuanced approach was accelerated by the decisions of the Fifth World Congress of the Comintern held in 1925  The Fifth World Congress decided that the period between 1917 and 1924 had been one of revolutionary upsurge  but that the new period was marked by the stabilization of capitalism and that revolutionary attempts in the near future were to be stopped  The American communists embarked then on the arduous work of locating and winning allies  That work was  however  complicated by factional struggles within the CPUSA  The party quickly developed a number of more or less fixed factional groupings within its leadership  a faction around the party s Executive Secretary C E  Ruthenberg  which was largely organized by his supporter Jay Lovestone  and the Foster Cannon faction  headed by William Z  Foster  who headed the Party s Trade Union Educational League  and James P  Cannon  who led the International Labor Defense  ILD  organization  11  Foster  who had been deeply involved in the Steel Strike of 1919 and had been a long time syndicalist and a Wobbly  had strong bonds with the progressive leaders of the Chicago Federation of Labor and  through them  with the Progressive Party  United States  1924  and nascent farmer labor parties  Under pressure from the Comintern  however  the party broke off relations with both groups in 1924  In 1925 the Comintern  through its representative Sergei Gusev  ordered the majority Foster faction to surrender control to Ruthenberg s faction  Foster complied  The factional infighting within the CPUSA did not end  however  the Communist leadership of the New York locals of the International Ladies  Garment Workers  Union lost the 1926 strike of cloakmakers in New York City in large part because of intra party factional rivalries  12  Ruthenberg died in 1927 and his ally  Lovestone  succeeded him as party secretary  Cannon attended the Sixth Congress of the Comintern in 1928  hoping to use his connections with leading circles within it to regain the advantage against the Lovestone faction  However Cannon and Maurice Spector of the Communist Party of Canada were accidentally given a copy of Trotsky s  Critique of the Draft Program of the Comintern   that they were instructed to read and return  Persuaded by its contents  they came to an agreement to return to America and campaign for the document s positions  A copy of the document was then smuggled out of the country in a child s toy  13  14  Back in America  Cannon and his close associates in the ILD such as Max Shachtman and Martin Abern  dubbed the  three generals without an army   15  began to organize support for Trotsky s theses  However  as this attempt to develop a Left Opposition came to light  they and their supporters were expelled  Cannon and his followers organized the Communist League of America as a section of Trotsky s International Left Opposition  At the same Congress  Lovestone had impressed the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as a strong supporter of Nikolai Bukharin  the general secretary of the Comintern  This was to have unfortunate consequences for Lovestone when  in 1929  Bukharin was on the losing end of a struggle with Stalin and was purged from his position on the Politburo and removed as head of the Comintern  In a reversal of the events of 1925  a Comintern delegation sent to the United States demanded that Lovestone resign as party secretary  in favor of his archrival Foster  despite the fact that Lovestone enjoyed the support of the vast majority of the American party s membership  Lovestone traveled to the Soviet Union and appealed directly to the Comintern  Stalin informed Lovestone that he  had a majority because the American Communist Party until now regarded you as the determined supporter of the Communist International  And it was only because the Party regarded you as friends of the Comintern that you had a majority in the ranks of the American Communist Party   16  When Lovestone returned to the United States  he and his ally Benjamin Gitlow were purged despite holding the leadership of the party  Ostensibly  this was not due to Lovestone s insubordination in challenging a decision by Stalin  but for his support for American Exceptionalism  the thesis that socialism could be achieved peacefully in the USA  Lovestone and Gitlow formed their own group called the  Communist Party  Opposition    a section of the pro Bukharin International Communist Opposition  which was initially larger than the Trotskyists but failed to survive past 1941  Lovestone had initially called his faction the  Communist Party  Majority Group   in the expectation that the majority of the CPUSA s members would join him  but only a few hundred people joined his new organization   edit  The Third Period  1928 1935  The upheavals within the CPUSA in 1928 were an echo of a much more significant change  Stalin s decision to break off any form of collaboration with western socialist parties  which were now condemned as  social fascists   This policy had particularly severe consequences in Germany  where the German Communist Party not only refused to work in alliance with the German Social Democratic Party  but attacked it and its members  The impact of this policy in the U S  was counted in membership figures  In 1928 there were about 24 000 members  By 1932 the total had fallen to 6 000 members  17  Opposing Stalin s Third Period policies in the Communist Party USA was James P  Cannon  For this action  he was expelled from the party  He then founded the Communist League of America with Max Shachtman and Martin Abern  and started publishing The Militant  It declared itself to be an external faction of the Communist Party until  as the Trotskyists saw it  Stalin s policies in Germany helped Hitler take power  At that point they started working towards the founding of a new international  the Fourth International  In the United States the principal impact of the Third Period was to end the CPUSA s efforts to organize within the AFL through the TUEL and to turn its efforts into organizing dual unions through the Trade Union Unity League  Foster went along with this change  even though it contradicted the policies he had fought for previously  By 1930  the party adopted the title of Communist Party of the USA  with the slogan of  the united front from below   The Party devoted much of its energy in the Great Depression to organizing the unemployed  attempting to found  red  unions  championing the rights of African Americans and fighting evictions of farmers and the working poor  18  At the same time  the Party attempted to weave its sectarian revolutionary politics into its day to day defense of workers  usually with only limited success  They recruited more disaffected members of the Socialist Party and an organization of African American socialists called the African Blood Brotherhood  some of whose members  particularly Harry Haywood  would later play important roles in communist work among blacks  In 1932  the retiring head of the CPUSA  William Z  Foster  published a book entitled Toward Soviet America  which laid out the Communist Party s plans for revolution and the building of a new socialist society based on the model of Soviet Russia  In that same year Earl Browder became General Secretary of the Party  At first Browder moved the party closer to Soviet interests  and helped to develop its secret apparatus or underground network  He also assisted in the recruitment of espionage sources and agents for the Soviet NKVD  Browder s own younger sister Margerite was an NKVD operative in Europe until removed from those duties at Browder s request  19  It was at this point that the CPUSA s foreign policy platform came under the complete control of Stalin  who enforced his directives through his secret police and foreign intelligence service  the NKVD  The NKVD controlled the secret apparatus of the CPUSA  including responsibility for political murders  kidnappings  and assassinations  20  21   edit  The Popular Front  1935 1939  CPUSA General Secretary Earl Browder The ideological rigidity of the third period began to crack  however  with two events  the election of Franklin D  Roosevelt as president of the United States in 1932 and Adolf Hitler s rise to power in Germany in 1933  Roosevelt s election and the passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act in 1933 sparked a tremendous upsurge in union organizing in 1933 and 1934  While the party line still favored creation of autonomous revolutionary unions  party activists chose to fold up those organizations and follow the mass of workers into the AFL unions they had been attacking  The Seventh Congress of the Comintern made the change in line official in 1935  when it declared the need for a popular front of all groups opposed to fascism  The CPUSA abandoned its opposition to the New Deal and provided many of the organizers for the Congress of Industrial Organizations  The party also sought unity with forces to its right  Earl Russell Browder offered to run as Norman Thomas  running mate on a joint Socialist Party Communist Party ticket in the 1936 presidential election but Thomas rejected this overture  The gesture did not mean that much in practical terms  since the CPUSA was  by 1936  effectively supporting Roosevelt in much of his trade union work  While continuing to run its own candidates for office  the CPUSA pursued a policy of representing the Democratic Party as the lesser evil in elections  Party members also rallied to the defense of the Spanish Republic during this period after a Nationalist military uprising moved to overthrow it  resulting in the Spanish Civil War  1936 to 1939   The CPUSA  along with leftists throughout the world  raised funds for medical relief while many of its members made their way to Spain with the aid of the party to join the Lincoln Brigade  one of the International Brigades  Among its other achievements  the Lincoln Brigade was the first American military force to include blacks and whites integrated on an equal basis  Intellectually  the Popular Front period saw the development of a strong communist influence in intellectual and artistic life  This was often through various organizations influenced or controlled by the Party or  as they were pejoratively known   fronts   The CPUSA under Browder supported Stalin s show trials in the Soviet Union  called the Moscow Trials  22  Therein  between August 1936 and mid 1938 the Soviet government indicted  tried  and shot virtually all of the remaining Old Bolsheviks  22  Beyond the show trials lay a broader purge  the Great Purge  that killed millions  22  Browder uncritically supported Stalin  likening Trotskyism to  cholera germs  and calling the purge  a signal service to the cause of progressive humanity   23  He compared the show trial defendants to domestic traitors Benedict Arnold  Aaron Burr  disloyal War of 1812 Federalists  and Confederate secessionists  while likening persons who  smeared  Stalin s name to those who had slandered Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt  23   edit  World War II and after  1939 1947  The Washington Commonwealth Federation newspaper after the signing of the Molotov Ribbentrop pact  The Washington Commonwealth Federation was an alleged Communist front organisation  The CPUSA was adamantly opposed to fascism during the Popular Front period  Although membership in the CPUSA rose to about 75 000 24  by 1938  many members left the party after the Soviet Union signed the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany on August 24  1939  25  While General Secretary Browder at first attacked Germany for its September 1  1939 invasion of western Poland  on September 11  the CPUSA received a blunt directive from Moscow denouncing the Polish government  26  Between September 14 16  CPUSA leaders bickered about the direction to take  26  On September 17 the Soviet Union invaded eastern Poland and occupied the Polish territory assigned to it by the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact  followed by co ordination with German forces in Poland  27  28  The British  French  and German Communist parties  all originally war supporters  abandoned their anti Fascist crusades  demanded peace  and denounced Allied governments  29  The CPUSA turned the focus of its public activities from anti fascism to advocating peace  not only opposing military preparations but also condemning those opposed to Hitler  The CPUSA attacked British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and French leader  douard Daladier  but did not at first attack President Roosevelt  reasoning that this could devastate American Communism  blaming instead Roosevelt s advisors  29  In October and November  after the Soviets invaded Finland and forced mutual assistance pacts from Estonia  Latvia and Lithuania  the CPUSA considered Russian security sufficient justification to support the actions  30  Secret short wave radio broadcasts in October from Comintern leader Georgi Dimitrov ordered Stalinist Browder to change the CPUSA s support for Roosevelt  30  On October 23  the CPUSA began attacking Roosevelt  31  The CPUSA dropped its boycott of Nazi goods  spread the slogans  The Yanks Are Not Coming  and  Hands Off   set up a  perpetual peace vigil  across the street from the White House and announced that Roosevelt was the head of the  war party of the American bourgeoisie   31  By April 1940  the CPUSA Daily Worker s line seemed not so much antiwar as simply pro German  32  A pamphlet stated the Jews had just as much to fear from Britain and France as they did Germany  32  In August 1940  after NKVD agent Ram n Mercader killed Leon Trotsky with an ice axe  Browder perpetuated Moscow s fiction that the killer  who had been dating one of Trotsky s secretaries  was a disillusioned follower  33  In allegiance to the Soviet Union  the party changed this policy again after Adolf Hitler broke the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact by attacking the Soviet Union on June 22  1941  Throughout the rest of World War II  the CPUSA continued a policy of militant  if sometimes bureaucratic  trade unionism while opposing strike actions at all costs  The leadership of the CPUSA was among the most vocal pro war voices in the United States  advocating unity against fascism  supporting the prosecution of leaders of the Socialist Workers Party under the newly enacted Smith Act  34  and opposing A  Philip Randolph s efforts to organize a march on Washington to dramatize black workers  demands for equal treatment on the job  Prominent CPUSA members and supporters  such as Dalton Trumbo and Pete Seeger  recalled anti war material they had previously released  Earl Browder expected the wartime coalition between the Soviet Union and the west to bring about a prolonged period of social harmony after the war  In order better to integrate the communist movement into American life the party was officially dissolved in 1944 and replaced by a  Communist Political Association   That harmony proved elusive  however  and the international Communist movement swung to the left after the war ended  Browder found himself isolated when a critical letter from the leader of the French Communist Party received wide circulation  As a result of this  in 1945 he was retired and replaced by William Z  Foster  who would remain the senior leader of the party until his own retirement in 1958  In line with other Communist parties worldwide  the CPUSA also swung to the left and  as a result  experienced a brief period in which a number of internal critics argued for a more leftist stance than the leadership was willing to countenance  The result was the expulsion of a handful of  premature anti revisionists    edit  Second Red Scare  1947 1958  Main article  Smith Act trials of communist party leaders More important for the party was the renewal of state persecution of the CPUSA  The Truman administration s loyalty oath program  introduced in 1947  drove some leftists out of federal employment and  more importantly  legitimized the notion of Communists as subversives  to be exposed and expelled from public and private employment  The House Committee on Un American Activities  whose hearings were perceived as forums where current and former Communists and those sympathetic to Communism were compelled under the duress of the ruin of their careers to confess and name other Communists  made even brief affiliation with the CPUSA or any related groups grounds for public exposure and attack  inspiring local governments to adopt loyalty oaths and investigative commissions of their own  Private parties  such as the motion picture industry and self appointed watchdog groups  extended the policy still further  This included the still controversial blacklist of actors  writers and directors in Hollywood who had been Communists or who had fallen in with Communist controlled or influenced organizations in the pre war and wartime years  The union movement purged party members as well  The CIO formally expelled a number of left led unions in 1949 after internal disputes triggered by the party s support for Henry Wallace s candidacy for President and its opposition to the Marshall Plan  while other labor leaders sympathetic to the CPUSA either were driven out of their unions or dropped their alliances with the party  In 1949 s Foley Square trial  the FBI prosecuted eleven members of the CPUSA s leadership  including Gus Hall and Eugene Dennis  The prosecution argued that the Party endorsed a violent overthrow of the government  but the defendants countered that they advocated for a peaceful transition to socialism  and that the First Amendment s guarantee of free speech and association protected their membership in a political party  The trial   held in Manhattan s Foley Square courthouse   was widely publicized by the media  and was featured on the cover of Time magazine twice  Large numbers of protesters supporting the communist defendants protested outside the courthouse daily  The defense attorneys used a  labor defense  strategy  which attacked the trial as a capitalist venture that would not provide a fair outcome to proletarian defendants  During the trial  the defense routinely antagonized the judge and prosecution  and five of the defendants were sent to jail for contempt of court for disrupting the trial  Public opinion was overwhelmingly against the defendants  and after a ten month trial  the jury found all 11 defendants guilty  and they were sentenced to terms of five years in federal prison  When the trial concluded  the judge sent all five defense attorneys to jail for contempt of court  Two of the attorneys were subsequently disbarred  The government prosecutors  encouraged by their success  arrested and convicted over 100 additional Party officers in the early 1950s  35  The widespread fear of Communism became even more acute after the Soviets  explosion of an atomic bomb in 1949 and discovery of Soviet espionage  36  Ambitious politicians  including Richard Nixon and Joseph McCarthy  made names for themselves by exposing or threatening to expose Communists within the Truman administration or later  in McCarthy s case  within the United States Army  Liberal groups  such as the Americans for Democratic Action  not only distanced themselves from communists and communist causes  but defined themselves as anti communist  The Congress outlawed the CPUSA in the Communist Control Act of 1954  37  However  the act was largely ineffectual thanks in part to its ambiguous language  In the 1961 case  Communist Party v  Catherwood  the United States Supreme Court ruled that the act did not bar the party from participating in New York s unemployment insurance system  No administration has tried to enforce it since  By the mid 1950s  membership of Communist Party USA had slipped from its 1944 peak of around 80 000 38  to an active base of approximately 5 000  39  Some 1 500 of these  members  were FBI informants  40  To the extent that the Communist Party did survive  it was crippled by the penetration activities of these informants  who kept close surveillance on the few remaining legitimate members of the Party on behalf of FBI Director J  Edgar Hoover  41  42  and the CPUSA dried up as a base for Soviet espionage  43   If it were not for me   Hoover told a State Department official in 1963   there would not be a Communist Party of the United States  Because I ve financed the Communist Party  in order to know what they are doing   44  William Sullivan  chief of intelligence operations for the FBI in the 1950s  has also described Hoover s continued zeal in pursuing action against the CPUSA as  insincere   as he was fully aware of the Party s moribund condition  44  Senator McCarthy had also kept up his attacks on the CPUSA during the 1950s despite also being aware of its impotency  44   edit  Party in crisis  1956 1989  The 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary and the Secret Speech of Nikita Khrushchev to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union criticizing Stalin had a cataclysmic effect on the previously Stalinist majority membership CPUSA  45  Membership plummeted and the leadership briefly faced a challenge from a loose grouping led by Daily Worker editor John Gates  which wished to democratize the party  Perhaps the greatest single blow dealt to the party in this period was the loss of the Daily Worker  published since 1924  which was suspended in 1958 due to falling circulation  Most of the critics would depart from the party demoralized  but others would remain active in progressive causes and would often end up working harmoniously with party members  This diaspora rapidly came to provide the audience for publications like the National Guardian and Monthly Review  which were to be important in the development of the New Left in the 1960s  The post 1956 upheavals in the CPUSA also saw the advent of a new leadership around former steel worker Gus Hall  Hall s views were very much those of his mentor Foster  but the younger man was to be more rigorous in ensuring the party was completely orthodox than the older man in his last years  Therefore  while remaining critics who wished to liberalize the party were expelled  so too were anti revisionist critics who took an anti Khrushchev stance  Many of these critics were elements on both U S  coasts who would come together to form the Progressive Labor Movement in 1961  Progressive Labor would come to play a role in many of the numerous Maoist organizations of the mid 1960s and early 1970s  Jack Shulman  Foster s secretary  also played a role in these organizations  he was not expelled from the CP  but resigned  In the 1970s  the CPUSA managed to grow in membership to about 25 000 members  despite the exodus of numerous Anti Revisionist and Maoist groups from its ranks  See also  New Communist Movement and Progressive Labor Party  United States   edit  From glasnost to the 21st century  1989 present  Ideologically  much appears to be up for grabs  for example regarding China  46  In a 2002 article in People s Weekly World  CPUSA correspondents Marilyn Bechtel and Debbie Bell said of their trip to the People s Republic of China    W e came away with a new respect for the thoughtfulness  thoroughness  energy and optimism with which the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people are going about the complex  long term process of building socialism in a vast developing country  which is of necessity part of an increasingly globalized economy   47  An overview of the Communist Party s current ideology can be found in the near definitive report   Reflections on Socialism   by Sam Webb  the Party s national chair  The article explains the Party s support for a democratic  anti racist  anti sexist  immediate left wing change for the United States  The report also covers the fall of the Socialist Bloc  claiming that democracy was not sufficiently developed in these countries  The report states that   On the one hand  socialism transformed and modernized backward societies  secured important economic and social rights  assisted countries breaking free of colonialism  contributed decisively to the victory over Nazism  constituted by its mere presence a pressure on the ruling classes in the capitalist world to make concessions to their working classes and democratic movements  and acted as a counterweight to the aggressive ambitions of U S  imperialism for nearly fifty years   The report stresses its dedication to revolutionary struggle  but states that Americans should look for peaceful revolutionary change  Webb says that capitalism cannot solve problems such as economic stagnation  racism  gender discrimination  or poverty  The report explains that there will be many transitory stages from capitalism  to socialism  and finally to communism  On the issue of markets in a socialist society  Webb states   Admittedly  market mechanisms in a socialist society can generate inequality  disproportions and imbalances  destructive competition  downward pressure on wages  and monopoly cornering of commodity markets   even the danger of capitalist restoration  But this is not sufficient reason for concluding that markets have no place in a socialist economy   The CPUSA recognizes the right of independence seeking groups  many of whom have been led by communist and communist oriented partisans  to defend themselves from imperialism  but rejects the use of violence in any United States uprising  The CPUSA argues that most violence throughout modern history is the result of capitalist ruling class violently trying to stop social change  48    While some governments run by people calling themselves Communists have been responsible for horrible acts of violence and repression  notably the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia  much if not most of the violence often blamed on revolutionary governments and parties is actually the responsibility of the conservative  reactionary  capitalist governments and parties      Many revolutions have been relatively peaceful  including the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Vietnamese Revolution of 1945   The bloodshed comes when those formerly in power initiate a civil war  or foreign armies invade  trying to reestablish capitalist  feudal  or colonial power   While we think that an objective  detailed analysis of most situations over the last century would conclude that capitalist and reactionary governments and parties are responsible for most of the violence  it is true that Communists have engaged in armed struggle  are not pacifists  and that some who called themselves Communists have engaged in repressive tactics    In order to make room for the rental of 4 floors in the CPUSA national building the CPUSA had to move its extensive archives  The archives of the Communist Party USA were donated in March  2007 to the Tamiment Library at New York University  The massive donation  in 12 000 cartons  included history from the founding of the party  20 000 books and pamphlets  and a million photographs from the archives of the Daily Worker  The Tamiment Library also holds a copy of the microfilmed archive of Communist Party documents from Soviet Archives held by the Library of Congress and from other materials which documents radical and Left history  49   edit  Ideology  edit  The CPUSA constitution and program According to its 2001 Constitution  the party operates on the principle of democratic centralism  its highest authority being the quadrennial National Convention  Article VI  Section 3 of the 2001 Constitution lays out certain positions as non negotiable   struggle for the unity of the working class  against all forms of national oppression  national chauvinism  discrimination and segregation  against all racist ideologies and practices  against all manifestations of male supremacy and discrimination against women  against homophobia and all manifestations of discrimination against gays  lesbians  bisexuals and transgender people   50  Among the points in the party s  Immediate Program  are a  12 hour minimum wage for all workers  national universal health care  and opposition to privatization of United States Social Security  Economic measures such as increased taxes on  the rich and corporations    strong regulation  of the financial industry   regulation and public ownership of utilities   and increased federal aid to cities and states  opposition to the Iraq War and other military interventions  opposition to free trade treaties such as the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   nuclear disarmament and a reduced military budget  various civil rights provisions  campaign finance reform including public financing of campaigns  and election law reform  including Instant Runoff Voting  51   edit  Bill of Rights socialism The Communist Party USA emphasizes a vision of socialism as an extension of American democracy  Seeking to  build socialism in the United States based on the revolutionary traditions and struggles  of American history  the CPUSA promotes a conception of  Bill of Rights Socialism  that will  guarantee all the freedoms we have won over centuries of struggle  and also extend the Bill of Rights to include freedom from unemployment   as well as freedom  from poverty  from illiteracy  and from discrimination and oppression   52  Reiterating the idea of property rights in socialist society as it is outlined in Karl Marx s Communist Manifesto  53  the Communist Party emphasizes that  Many myths have been propagated about socialism  Contrary to right wing claims  socialism would not take away the personal private property of workers   but  the private ownership of major industries  financial institutions  and other large corporations  and the excessive luxuries of the super rich   52  Rather than making all wages entirely equal  the Communist Party USA holds that building socialism would entail  eliminating private wealth from stock speculation  from private ownership of large corporations  from the export of capital and jobs  and from the exploitation of large numbers of workers   52   edit  Living standards Among the primary concerns of the Communist Party are the problems of unemployment  underemployment and job insecurity  which Communism understands as the natural result of the profit driven incentives of the capitalist economy   Millions of workers are unemployed  underemployed  or insecure in their jobs  even during economic upswings and periods of  recovery  from recessions  Most workers experience long years of stagnant and declining real wages  while health and education costs soar  Many workers are forced to work second and third jobs to make ends meet  Most workers now average four different occupations during their lifetime  many involuntarily moved from job to job and career to career  Often  retirement age workers are forced to continue working just to provide health care for themselves and their families  Millions of people continuously live below the poverty level  many suffer homelessness and hunger  Public and private programs to alleviate poverty and hunger do not reach everyone  and are inadequate even for those they do reach  With capitalist globalization  jobs move from place to place as capitalists export factories and even entire industries to other countries in a relentless search for the lowest wages   52  The Communist Party believes that  class struggle starts with the fight for wages  hours  benefits  working conditions  job security  and jobs  But it also includes an endless variety of other forms for fighting specific battles  resisting speed up  picketing  contract negotiations  strikes  demonstrations  lobbying for pro labor legislation  elections  and even general strikes   52  The Communist Party s national programs understands that workers who struggle  against the capitalist class or any part of it on any issue with the aim of improving or defending their lives  are part of the class struggle  52   edit  Imperialism and war The Communists maintain that developments within the foreign policy of the United States as reflected in the rise of neoconservatives and other groups associated with right wing politics have developed in tandem with the interests of large scale capital such as the multinational corporations  The state thereby becomes thrust into a proxy role that is essentially inclined to help facilitate  control by one section of the capitalist class over all others and over the whole of society   52  Accordingly  the Communist Party holds that right wing policymakers such as the neoconservatives  steering the state away from working class interests on behalf of a disproportionately powerful capitalist class  have     demonized foreign opponents of the U S   covertly funded the right wing initiated civil war in Nicaragua  and gave weapons to the Saddam Hussein dictatorship in Iraq  They picked small countries to invade  including Panama and Grenada  testing new military equipment and strategy  and breaking down resistance at home and abroad to U S  military invasion as a policy option   52  From its ideological framework  the Communist Party understands imperialism as the pinnacle of capitalist development  the state  working on behalf of the few who wield disproportionate power  assumes the role of proffering  phony rationalizations  for economically driven imperial ambition as a means to promote the sectional economic interests of big business  52  In opposition to what it considers the ultimate agenda of the conservative wing of U S  politics  the Communist Party rejects such foreign policy proposals as the Bush Doctrine  rejecting the right of the American government to attack  any country it wants  to conduct war without end until it succeeds everywhere  and even to use  tactical  nuclear weapons and militarize space  Whoever does not support the U S  policy is condemned as an opponent  Whenever international organizations  such as the United Nations  do not support U S  government policies  they are reluctantly tolerated until the U S  government is able to subordinate or ignore them   52  Juxtaposing the support from the Republicans and the right wing of the Democratic Party for the Bush administration led invasion of Iraq with the many millions of Americans who opposed the invasion of Iraq from its beginning  the Communist Party notes the spirit of opposition towards the war coming from the American public   Thousands of grassroots peace committees  were  organized by ordinary Americans    neighborhoods  small towns and universities expressing opposition in countless creative ways  Thousands of actions  vigils  teach ins and newspaper advertisements were organized  The largest demonstrations were held since the Vietnam War  500 000 marched in New York after the war started  Students at over 500 universities conducted a Day of Action for  Books not Bombs    Over 150 anti war resolutions were passed by city councils  Resolutions were passed by thousands of local unions and community organizations  Local and national actions were organized on the Internet  including the  Virtual March on Washington  D C      officials were flooded with millions of calls  emails and letters   In an unprecedented development  large sections of the US labor movement officially opposed the war  In contrast  it took years to build labor opposition to the Vietnam War    Chicago labor leaders formed Labor United for Peace  Justice and Prosperity  They concluded that mass education of their members was essential to counter false propaganda  and that the fight for the peace  economic security and democratic rights was interrelated  54  The Party has consistently opposed U S  involvement in the Korean War  the Vietnam War  the First Gulf War  and the post September 11 conflicts in both Iraq and Afghanistan  The CPUSA does not believe that the threat of terrorism can be resolved through war  55   edit  Women and minorities The Communist Party USA s Constitution defines the working class as a class which is  multiracial  multinational  and unites men and women  young and old  employed and unemployed  organized and unorganized  gay and straight  native born and immigrant  urban and rural  and composed of workers who perform a large range of physical and mental labor the vast majority of our society   50  The Communist Party seeks equal rights for women  equal pay for equal work  the protection of reproductive rights  together with putting an end to sexism  56  The Party s ranks include a Women s Equality Commission  which recognizes the role of women as an asset in moving towards building socialism  57  Historically significant in American history as an early fighter for African Americans  rights and playing a leading role in protesting the lynchings of African Americans in the South  the Communist Party  in its national program today  calls racism the  classic divide and conquer tactic      58  From its New York City base  the Communist Party s Ben Davis Club and other Communist Party organizations have been involved in local activism in Harlem and other African American and minority communities  59  The Communist Party was instrumental in the founding of the progressive Black Radical Congress in 1998  Historically significant in Latino working class history as a successful organizer of the Mexican American working class in the Southwestern United States in the 1930s  the Communist Party regards working class Latino people as another oppressed group targeted by overt racism as well as systemic discrimination in areas such as education  and sees the participation of Latino voters in a general mass movement in both party based and nonpartisan work as an essential goal for major left wing progress  60  The Communist Party holds that racial and ethnic discrimination not only harms minorities  but is pernicious to working class people of all backgrounds  as any discriminatory practices between demographic sections of the working class constitute an inherently divisive practice responsible for  obstructing the development of working class consciousness  driving wedges in class unity to divert attention from class exploitation  and creating extra profits for the capitalist class   61  The Communists support an end to racial profiling  51  The party supports continued enforcement of civil rights laws as well as affirmative action  51   edit  The environment The Communist Party notes its commitment to participating in environmental movements wherever possible  emphasizing the significance of building unity between the environmental movement and other progressive tendencies  62  The Party s most recently released environmental document the CPUSA National Committee s  2008 Global Warming Report  takes note of the necessity of  major changes in how we live  move  produce  grow  and market   These changes  the Communists believe  cannot be effectively accomplished solely on the basis of profit considerations   They require long term planning  massive investment in redesigning and re engineering  collective input  husbanding resources  social investment in research for long term sustainability  and major conservation efforts   Various approaches blame the victims  Supposedly the only solution is to change individual consumer choices  since people in general are claimed to cause the problem  But consumers  workers  and poor people don t have any say in energy plant construction  in decisions about trade or plant relocation or job export  in deciding on tax subsidies to polluting industries like the oil industry   63  Supporting cooperation between economically advanced and less economically developed nations in the area of environmental cooperation  the Communist Party USA stands in favor of promoting  transfer from developed countries to developing countries of sustainable technology  and funds for capital investment in sustainable agriculture  energy  and industry  We should support efforts to get the developed nations to make major contributions to a fund to protect the rainforests from devastation   63  The Communist Party opposes drilling in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge  62  the use of nuclear power until  and unless  there is a safe way to dispose of its waste  62  and conceives of nuclear war as the greatest possible environmental threat  62   edit  Religion The Communist Party is not against religion  but instead regards positively religious people s belief in justice  peace and respectful relations among the peoples  To build good relations with supporters of religion  the party has its own Religious Commission  64   edit  Relations with other groups  edit  The U S  labor movement See main article  Communists in the U S  Labor Movement  1919 1937   Communists in the U S  Labor Movement  1937 1950  The Communist Party has sought to play an active role in the US labor movement since its origins as part of its effort to build a mass movement of American workers to bring about their own liberation through socialist revolution  As the prospects for such a social cataclysm have faded over time  the party has increasingly emphasized the ameliorative value of trade unions in capitalist society   edit  Soviet funding and espionage From 1959 until 1989  when Gus Hall attacked the initiatives taken by Mikhail Gorbachev in the Soviet Union  the CPUSA received a substantial subsidy from the Soviet Union  There is at least one receipt signed by Gus Hall in the KGB archives  65  Starting with  75 000 in 1959 this was increased gradually to  3 million in 1987  This substantial amount reflected the Party s subservience to the Moscow line  in contrast to the Italian and later Spanish and British Communist parties  whose Eurocommunism deviated from the orthodox line in the late 1970s  Releases from the Soviet archives show that all national Communist parties that conformed to the Soviet line were funded in the same fashion  From the Communist point of view this international funding arose from the internationalist nature of Communism itself  fraternal assistance was considered the duty of Communists in any one country to give aid to their comrades in other countries  From the anti communist point of view  this funding represented an unwarranted interference by one country in the affairs of another  The cutoff of funds in 1989 resulted in a financial crisis  which forced the CPUSA to cut back publication in 1990 of the Party newspaper  the People s Daily World  to weekly publication  the People s Weekly World   references for this section are provided below  Much more controversial than mere funding  however  is the alleged involvement of CPUSA members in espionage for the Soviet Union  Whittaker Chambers has alleged that Sandor Goldberger also known as  Josef Peters   who commonly wrote under the name J  Peters headed the CPUSA s underground secret apparatus from 1932 to 1938 and pioneered its r le as an auxiliary to Soviet intelligence activities  66 Bernard Schuster  Organizational Secretary of the New York District of the CPUSA  is claimed to have been the operational recruiter and conduit for members of the CPUSA into the ranks of the secret apparatus  or  Group A line   Stalin publicly disbanded the Comintern in 1943  A Moscow NKVD message to all stations on September 12  1943 detailed instructions for handling intelligence sources within the CPUSA after the disestablishment of the Comintern  There are a number of decrypted World War II Soviet messages between NKVD offices in the United States and Moscow  also known as the Venona cables  The Venona cables and other published sources appear to confirm that Julius Rosenberg was guilty of espionage  Theodore Hall  a Harvard trained physicist who did not join the CPUSA until 1952  began passing information on the atomic bomb to the Soviets soon after he was hired at Los Alamos at age 19  Hall  who was known as Mlad by his KGB handlers  escaped prosecution  Hall s wife  aware of his espionage  claims that their NKVD handler had advised them to plead innocent  as the Rosenbergs did  if formally charged  It was the belief of opponents of the CPUSA such as J  Edgar Hoover  long time director of the FBI  and Joseph McCarthy  for whom McCarthyism is named  and other anti communists that the CPUSA constituted an active conspiracy  was secretive  loyal to a foreign power  and whose members assisted Soviet intelligence in the clandestine infiltration of American government  This is the  traditionalist  view of some in the field of Communist studies such as Harvey Klehr and John Earl Haynes  since supported by several memoirs of ex Soviet KGB officers and information obtained from VENONA and Soviet archives  67  68  69  At one time this view was shared by the majority of the United States Congress  In the  Findings and declarations of fact  section of the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950  50 U S C  Chap  23 Sub  IV Sec  841   it stated   although purportedly a political party  is in fact an instrumentality of a conspiracy    prescribed for it by the foreign leaders    to carry into action slavishly the assignments given   acknowledges no constitutional or statutory limitations    its dedication to the proposition that the present constitutional Government of the United States ultimately must be brought to ruin by any available means  including resort to force and violence    as the agency of a hostile foreign power renders its existence a clear present and continuing danger   70  In 1993  experts from the Library of Congress traveled to Moscow to copy previously secret archives of Communist Party USA  CPUSA  records  sent to the Soviet Union for safekeeping by party organizers  The records provided an irrefutable link between Soviet intelligence and information obtained by the CPUSA and its contacts in the U S  government from the 1920s through the 1940s  Some documents revealed that the CPUSA was actively involved in secretly recruiting party members from African American groups and rural farm workers  Other CPUSA records contained further evidence that Soviet sympathizers had indeed infiltrated the State Department  beginning in the 1930s  Included in CPUSA archival records were confidential letters from two U S  ambassadors in Europe to Roosevelt and a senior State Department official  Thanks to an official in the State department sympathetic to the Party  the confidential correspondence  concerning political and economic matters in Europe  ended up in the hands of Soviet intelligence  67  71  72   edit  Criminal prosecutions When the Communist Party was formed in 1919 the United States government was engaged in prosecution of socialists who had opposed World War I and military service  This prosecution was continued in 1919 and January  1920 in the Palmer Raids or the red scare  Rank and file foreign born members of the Party were targeted and as many as possible were arrested and deported  leaders were prosecuted and in some cases sentenced to prison terms  In the late 1930s  with the authorization of President Franklin D  Roosevelt  the Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI  began investigating both domestic Nazis and Communists  Congress passed the Smith Act  which made it illegal to advocate  abet  or teach the desirability of overthrowing the government  in 1940  In 1949  the federal government put Eugene Dennis  William Z  Foster and ten other CPUSA leaders on trial for advocating the violent overthrow of the government  Because the prosecution could not show that any of the defendants had openly called for violence or been involved in accumulating weapons for a proposed revolution  it relied on the testimony of former members of the party that the defendants had privately advocated the overthrow of the government and on quotations from the work of Karl Marx  Lenin and other revolutionary figures of the past  During the course of the trial the judge held several of the defendants and all of their counsel in contempt of court  All of the remaining eleven defendants were found guilty  The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of their convictions by a 6 2 vote in Dennis v  United States  341 U S  494  1951   The government then proceeded with the prosecutions of more than 100  second string  members of the party  Panicked by these arrests and the fear that it was compromised by informants  Dennis and other party leaders decided to go underground and to disband many affiliated groups  The move only heightened the political isolation of the leadership  while making it nearly impossible for the Party to function  The widespread support of action against communists and their associates began to abate somewhat after Senator Joseph McCarthy overreached himself in the Army McCarthy Hearings  producing a backlash  The end of the Korean War in 1953 also led to a lessening of anxieties about subversion  The Supreme Court brought a halt to the Smith Act prosecutions in 1957 in its decision in Yates v  United States  354 U S  298  1957   which required that the government prove that the defendant had actually taken concrete steps toward the forcible overthrow of the government  rather than merely advocating it in theory   edit  African Americans Main article  The Communist Party USA and African Americans The Communist Party USA played a significant role in defending the rights of African Americans during its heyday in the 1930s and 1940s  Earlier however  at the direction of the Comintern in 1928  the party advocated for many years a separate  Negro Republic   to be founded in the heavily black populated areas of the Southern part of the United States  Based on Stalin s nationalities policy in the Soviet Union  blacks throughout the US were to be declared citizens of this new Republic  then shipped off to it  citation needed  Throughout its history many of the Party s leaders and political thinkers have been African Americans  James Ford  Charlene Mitchell  Angela Davis  and Jarvis Tyner  the current executive vice chair of the Party  all ran as presidential or vice presidential candidates on the Party ticket  Others like Benjamin J  Davis  William L  Patterson  Harry Haywood  James Jackson  Henry Winston  Claude Lightfoot  Alphaeus Hunton  Doxey Wilkerson  Claudia Jones  and John Pittman contributed in important ways to the Party s approaches to major issues from human and civil rights  peace  women s equality  the national question  working class unity  Marxist thought  cultural struggle and more  Their contributions have had a lasting impact on not only the Party but the general public as well  Noted African American thinkers  artists  and writers such as Claude McKay  Richard Wright  Ann Petry  W  E  B  Du Bois  Shirley Graham Du Bois  Lloyd Brown  Charles White  Elizabeth Catlett  Paul Robeson  Frank Marshall Davis  Gwendolyn Brooks  and many more were one time members or supporters of the Party  and the Communists also had a close alliance with Harlem Congressman Adam Clayton Powell  Jr  73  The party s work to appeal to African Americans continues to this day  It was instrumental in the founding of the Black Radical Congress in 1998   edit  The gay liberation movement One of America s most prominent sexual radicals  Harry Hay  developed his political views as an active member of the CPUSA  but his founding in the early 1950s of the Mattachine Society  America s second gay rights group  was not seen as something Communists should associate with organizationally  Most Party members saw homosexuality as something done by those with fascist tendencies  following the lead of the Soviet Union in criminalizing the practice for that reason  and Hay was expelled from the party as an ideological risk  In 2004  the editors of Political Affairs published articles detailing their self criticism of the Party s early views of gay and lesbian rights 74  and praised Hay s work   edit  The U S  peace movement The Communist Party opposed the U S  involvement in the Vietnam War  the invasion of Grenada  and U S  support for anti communist military dictatorships and movements in Central America  Meanwhile  some in the peace movement and the New Left rejected the CPUSA for what it saw as the party s bureaucratic rigidity and for its steadfastly close association with Soviet Union  The CPUSA has been consistently opposed to the U S  s 2003 2010 in Iraq  75 United for Peace and Justice  currently the largest peace and justice coalition in the U S   includes the CPUSA as a member group  with Judith LeBlanc  who chairs the CPUSA s Peace and Solidarity Commission  being a member of the Steering Committee of UFPJ   edit  Presidential tickets Year President Vice President
