Artificial intelligence From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search  AI  redirects here  For other uses  see Ai  For other uses  see Artificial intelligence  disambiguation   Artificial intelligence  AI  is the intelligence of machines and the branch of computer science that aims to create it  AI textbooks define the field as  the study and design of intelligent agents  1  where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success  2 John McCarthy  who coined the term in 1956  3  defines it as  the science and engineering of making intelligent machines   4  The field was founded on the claim that a central property of humans  intelligence the sapience of Homo sapiens can be so precisely described that it can be simulated by a machine  5  This raises philosophical issues about the nature of the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings  issues which have been addressed by myth  fiction and philosophy since antiquity  6  Artificial intelligence has been the subject of optimism  7  but has also suffered setbacks 8  and  today  has become an essential part of the technology industry  providing the heavy lifting for many of the most difficult problems in computer science  9  AI research is highly technical and specialized  deeply divided into subfields that often fail in the task of communicating with each other  10  Subfields have grown up around particular institutions  the work of individual researchers  and the solution of specific problems  resulting in longstanding differences of opinion about how AI should be done and the application of widely differing tools  The central problems of AI include such traits as reasoning  knowledge  planning  learning  communication  perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects  11  General intelligence  or  strong AI   is still among the field s long term goals  12  Contents 1 History 2

myths  such as Talos of Crete  the bronze robot of Hephaestus  and Pygmalion s Galatea  13  Human likenesses believed to have intelligence were built in every major civilization  animated cult images were worshipped in Egypt and Greece 14  and humanoid automatons were built by Yan Shi  Hero of Alexandria and Al Jazari  15  It was also widely believed that artificial beings had been created by J bir ibn Hayy n  Judah Loew and Paracelsus  16  By the 19th and 20th centuries  artificial beings had become a common feature in fiction  as in Mary Shelley s Frankenstein or Karel  apek s R U R   Rossum s Universal Robots   17 Pamela McCorduck argues that all of these are examples of an ancient urge  as she describes it   to forge the gods   6  Stories of these creatures and their fates discuss many of the same hopes  fears and ethical concerns that are presented by artificial intelligence  Mechanical or  formal  reasoning has been developed by philosophers and mathematicians since antiquity  The study of logic led directly to the invention of the programmable digital electronic computer  based on the work of mathematician Alan Turing and others  Turing s theory of computation suggested that a machine  by shuffling symbols as simple as  0  and  1   could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction  18  19  This  along with concurrent discoveries in neurology  information theory and cybernetics  inspired a small group of researchers to begin to seriously consider the possibility of building an electronic brain  20  The field of AI research was founded at a conference on the campus of Dartmouth College in the summer of 1956  21  The attendees  including John McCarthy  Marvin Minsky  Allen Newell and Herbert Simon  became the leaders of AI research for many decades  22  They and their students wrote programs that were  to most people  simply astonishing  23  Computers were solving word problems in algebra  proving logical theorems and speaking English  24  By the middle of the 1960s  research in the U S  was heavily funded by the Department of Defense 25  and laboratories had been established around the world  26  AI s founders were profoundly optimistic about the future of the new field  Herbert Simon predicted that  machines will be capable  within twenty years  of doing any work a man can do  and Marvin Minsky agreed  writing that  within a generation     the problem of creating  artificial intelligence  will substantially be solved   27  They had failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the problems they faced  28  In 1974  in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects  both the U S  and British governments cut off all undirected exploratory research in AI  The next few years  when funding for projects was hard to find  would later be called the  AI winter   29  In the early 1980s  AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems  30  a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of one or more human experts  By 1985 the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars  At the same time  Japan s fifth generation computer project inspired the U S and British governments to restore funding for academic research in the field  31  However  beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987  AI once again fell into disrepute  and a second  longer lasting AI winter began  32  In the 1990s and early 21st century  AI achieved its greatest successes  albeit somewhat behind the scenes  Artificial intelligence is used for logistics  data mining  medical diagnosis and many other areas throughout the technology industry  9  The success was due to several factors  the increasing computational power of computers  see Moore s law   a greater emphasis on solving specific subproblems  the creation of new ties between AI and other fields working on similar problems  and a new commitment by researchers to solid mathematical methods and rigorous scientific standards  33  On 11 May 1997  Deep Blue became the first computer chess playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion  Garry Kasparov  34  In 2005  a Stanford robot won the DARPA Grand Challenge by driving autonomously for 131 miles along an unrehearsed desert trail  35  Two years later  a team from CMU won the DARPA Urban Challenge by autonomously navigating 55 miles in an Urban environment while adhering to traffic hazards and all traffic laws  36  In February 2011  in a Jeopardy  quiz show exhibition match  IBM s question answering system  Watson  defeated the two greatest Jeopardy  champions  Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings  by a significant margin  37  The leading edge definition of artificial intelligence research is changing over time  One pragmatic definition is   AI research is that which computing scientists do not know how to do cost effectively today   For example  in 1956 optical character recognition  OCR  was considered AI  but today  sophisticated OCR software with a context sensitive spell checker and grammar checker software comes for free with most image scanners  No one would any longer consider already solved computing science problems like OCR  artificial intelligence  today  Low cost entertaining chess playing software is commonly available for tablet computers  DARPA no longer provides significant funding for chess playing computing system development  The Kinect which provides a 3D body motion interface for the Xbox 360 uses algorithms that emerged from lengthy AI research  38  but few consumers realize the technology source  AI applications are no longer the exclusive domain of U S  Department of Defense R amp D  but are now commonplace consumer items and inexpensive intelligent toys  In common usage  the term  AI  no longer seems to apply to off the shelf solved computing science problems  which may have originally emerged out of years of AI research   edit  Problems  Can a machine act intelligently   is still an open problem  Taking  A machine can act intelligently  as a working hypothesis  many researchers have attempted to build such a machine  The general problem of simulating  or creating  intelligence has been broken down into a number of specific sub problems  These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers would like an intelligent system to display  The traits described below have received the most attention  11   edit  Deduction  reasoning  problem solving Early AI researchers developed algorithms that imitated the step by step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions  39  By the late 1980s and  90s  AI research had also developed highly successful methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information  employing concepts from probability and economics  40  For difficult problems  most of these algorithms can require enormous computational resources   most experience a  combinatorial explosion   the amount of memory or computer time required becomes astronomical when the problem goes beyond a certain size  The search for more efficient problem solving algorithms is a high priority for AI research  41  Human beings solve most of their problems using fast  intuitive judgments rather than the conscious  step by step deduction that early AI research was able to model  42  AI has made some progress at imitating this kind of  sub symbolic  problem solving  embodied agent approaches emphasize the importance of sensorimotor skills to higher reasoning  neural net research attempts to simulate the structures inside human and animal brains that give rise to this skill   edit  Knowledge representation An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts  Main articles  Knowledge representation and Commonsense knowledge Knowledge representation 43  and knowledge engineering 44  are central to AI research  Many of the problems machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge about the world  Among the things that AI needs to represent are  objects  properties  categories and relations between objects  45  situations  events  states and time  46  causes and effects  47  knowledge about knowledge  what we know about what other people know   48  and many other  less well researched domains  A representation of  what exists  is an ontology  borrowing a word from traditional philosophy   of which the most general are called upper ontologies  49  Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are  Default reasoning and the qualification problem Many of the things people know take the form of  working assumptions   For example  if a bird comes up in conversation  people typically picture an animal that is fist sized  sings  and flies  None of these things are true about all birds  John McCarthy identified this problem in 1969 50  as the qualification problem  for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent  there tend to be a huge number of exceptions  Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires  AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem  51  The breadth of commonsense knowledge The number of atomic facts that the average person knows is astronomical  Research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of commonsense knowledge  e g   Cyc  require enormous amounts of laborious ontological engineering   they must be built  by hand  one complicated concept at a time  52  A major goal is to have the computer understand enough concepts to be able to learn by reading from sources like the internet  and thus be able to add to its own ontology  citation needed  The subsymbolic form of some commonsense knowledge Much of what people know is not represented as  facts  or  statements  that they could express verbally  For example  a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it  feels too exposed  53  or an art critic can take one look at a statue and instantly realize that it is a fake  54  These are intuitions or tendencies that are represented in the brain non consciously and sub symbolically  55  Knowledge like this informs  supports and provides a context for symbolic  conscious knowledge  As with the related problem of sub symbolic reasoning  it is hoped that situated AI or computational intelligence will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge  55   edit  Planning A hierarchical control system is a form of control system in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a hierarchy  Main article  Automated planning and scheduling Intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them  56  They need a way to visualize the future  they must have a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it  and be able to make choices that maximize the utility  or  value   of the available choices  57  In classical planning problems  the agent can assume that it is the only thing acting on the world and it can be certain what the consequences of its actions may be  58  However  if the agent is not the only actor  it must periodically ascertain whether the world matches its predictions and it must change its plan as this becomes necessary  requiring the agent to reason under uncertainty  59  Multi agent planning uses the cooperation and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal  Emergent behavior such as this is used by evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence  60   edit  Learning Main article  Machine learning Machine learning 61  has been central to AI research from the beginning  62  In 1956  at the original Dartmouth AI summer conference  Ray Solomonoff wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning   An Inductive Inference Machine   63 Unsupervised learning is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input  Supervised learning includes both classification and numerical regression  Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in  after seeing a number of examples of things from several categories  Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change  In reinforcement learning 64  the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones  These can be analyzed in terms of decision theory  using concepts like utility  The mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory  65   edit  Natural language processing A parse tree represents the syntactic structure of a sentence according to some formal grammar  Main article  Natural language processing Natural language processing 66  gives machines the ability to read and understand the languages that humans speak  A sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable natural language user interfaces and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human written sources  such as Internet texts  Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include information retrieval  or text mining  and machine translation  67   edit  Motion and manipulation Main article  Robotics The field of robotics 68  is closely related to AI  Intelligence is required for robots to be able to handle such tasks as object manipulation 69  and navigation  with sub problems of localization  knowing where you are   mapping  learning what is around you  and motion planning  figuring out how to get there   70   edit  Perception Main articles  Machine perception  Computer vision  and Speech recognition Machine perception 71  is the ability to use input from sensors  such as cameras  microphones  sonar and others more exotic  to deduce aspects of the world  Computer vision 72  is the ability to analyze visual input  A few selected subproblems are speech recognition  73 facial recognition and object recognition  74   edit  Social intelligence Main article  Affective computing Kismet  a robot with rudimentary social skills  citation needed  Affective computing is the study and development of systems and devices that can recognize  interpret  process  and simulate human affects  It is an interdisciplinary field spanning computer sciences  psychology  and cognitive science  75  While the origins of the field may be traced as far back as to early philosophical enquiries into emotion  76  the more modern branch of computer science originated with Rosalind Picard s 1995 paper 77  on affective computing  78  79  A motivation for the research is the ability to simulate empathy  The machine should interpret the emotional state of humans and adapt its behaviour to them  giving an appropriate response for those emotions  Emotion and social skills 80  play two roles for an intelligent agent  First  it must be able to predict the actions of others  by understanding their motives and emotional states   This involves elements of game theory  decision theory  as well as the ability to model human emotions and the perceptual skills to detect emotions   Also  in an effort to facilitate human computer interaction  an intelligent machine might want to be able to display emotions even if it does not actually experience them itself in order to appear sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction   edit  Creativity Main article  Computational creativity A sub field of AI addresses creativity both theoretically  from a philosophical and psychological perspective  and practically  via specific implementations of systems that generate outputs that can be considered creative  or systems that identify and assess creativity   Related areas of computational research are Artificial intuition and Artificial imagination  citation needed   edit  General intelligence Main articles  Strong AI and AI complete Most researchers hope that their work will eventually be incorporated into a machine with general intelligence  known as strong AI   combining all the skills above and exceeding human abilities at most or all of them  12  A few believe that anthropomorphic features like artificial consciousness or an artificial brain may be required for such a project  81  82  Many of the problems above are considered AI complete  to solve one problem  you must solve them all  For example  even a straightforward  specific task like machine translation requires that the machine follow the author s argument  reason   know what is being talked about  knowledge   and faithfully reproduce the author s intention  social intelligence   Machine translation  therefore  is believed to be AI complete  it may require strong AI to be done as well as humans can do it  83   edit  Approaches There is no established unifying theory or paradigm that guides AI research  Researchers disagree about many issues  84  A few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these  should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying psychology or neurology  Or is human biology as irrelevant to AI research as bird biology is to aeronautical engineering  85  Can intelligent behavior be described using simple  elegant principles  such as logic or optimization   Or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems  86  Can intelligence be reproduced using high level symbols  similar to words and ideas  Or does it require  sub symbolic  processing  87  John Haugeland  who coined the term GOFAI  Good Old Fashioned Artificial Intelligence   also proposed that AI should more properly be referred to as synthetic intelligence  88  a term which has since been adopted by some non GOFAI researchers  89  90   edit  Cybernetics and brain simulation Main articles  Cybernetics and Computational neuroscience In the 1940s and 1950s  a number of researchers explored the connection between neurology  information theory  and cybernetics  Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence  such as W  Grey Walter s turtles and the Johns Hopkins Beast  Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at Princeton University and the Ratio Club in England  20  By 1960  this approach was largely abandoned  although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s   edit  Symbolic Main article  GOFAI When access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s  AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation  The research was centered in three institutions  CMU  Stanford and MIT  and each one developed its own style of research  John Haugeland named these approaches to AI  good old fashioned AI  or  GOFAI   91  Cognitive simulation Economist Herbert Simon and Allen Newell studied human problem solving skills and attempted to formalize them  and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence  as well as cognitive science  operations research and management science  Their research team used the results of psychological experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems  This tradition  centered at Carnegie Mellon University would eventually culminate in the development of the Soar architecture in the middle 80s  92  93  Logic based Unlike Newell and Simon  John McCarthy felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought  but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem solving  regardless of whether people used the same algorithms  85  His laboratory at Stanford  SAIL  focused on using formal logic to solve a wide variety of problems  including knowledge representation  planning and learning  94  Logic was also focus of the work at the University of Edinburgh and elsewhere in Europe which led to the development of the programming language Prolog and the science of logic programming  95   Anti logic  or  scruffy  Researchers at MIT  such as Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert  96  found that solving difficult problems in vision and natural language processing required ad hoc solutions   they argued that there was no simple and general principle  like logic  that would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior  Roger Schank described their  anti logic  approaches as  scruffy   as opposed to the  neat  paradigms at CMU and Stanford   86 Commonsense knowledge bases  such as Doug Lenat s Cyc  are an example of  scruffy  AI  since they must be built by hand  one complicated concept at a time  97  Knowledge based When computers with large memories became available around 1970  researchers from all three traditions began to build knowledge into AI applications  98  This  knowledge revolution  led to the development and deployment of expert systems  introduced by Edward Feigenbaum   the first truly successful form of AI software  30  The knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple AI applications   edit  Sub symbolic During the 1960s  symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high level thinking in small demonstration programs  Approaches based on cybernetics or neural networks were abandoned or pushed into the background  99  By the 1980s  however  progress in symbolic AI seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition  especially perception  robotics  learning and pattern recognition  A number of researchers began to look into  sub symbolic  approaches to specific AI problems  87  Bottom up  embodied  situated  behavior based or nouvelle AI Researchers from the related field of robotics  such as Rodney Brooks  rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive  100  Their work revived the non symbolic viewpoint of the early cybernetics researchers of the 50s and reintroduced the use of control theory in AI  This coincided with the development of the embodied mind thesis in the related field of cognitive science  the idea that aspects of the body  such as movement  perception and visualization  are required for higher intelligence  Computational Intelligence Interest in neural networks and  connectionism  was revived by David Rumelhart and others in the middle 1980s  101  These and other sub symbolic approaches  such as fuzzy systems and evolutionary computation  are now studied collectively by the emerging discipline of computational intelligence  102   edit  Statistical In the 1990s  AI researchers developed sophisticated mathematical tools to solve specific subproblems  These tools are truly scientific  in the sense that their results are both measurable and verifiable  and they have been responsible for many of AI s recent successes  The shared mathematical language has also permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields  like mathematics  economics or operations research   Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig describe this movement as nothing less than a  revolution  and  the victory of the neats   33  Critiques argue that these techniques are too focussed on particular problems and have failed to address the long term goal of general intelligence  103   edit  Integrating the approaches Intelligent agent paradigm An intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success  The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems  More complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings  such as firms   The paradigm gives researchers license to study isolated problems and find solutions that are both verifiable and useful  without agreeing on one single approach  An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works   some agents are symbolic and logical  some are sub symbolic neural networks and others may use new approaches  The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fields such as decision theory and economics that also use concepts of abstract agents  The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s  2  Agent architectures and cognitive architectures Researchers have designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting intelligent agents in a multi agent system  104  A system with both symbolic and sub symbolic components is a hybrid intelligent system  and the study of such systems is artificial intelligence systems integration  A hierarchical control system provides a bridge between sub symbolic AI at its lowest  reactive levels and traditional symbolic AI at its highest levels  where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modelling  105 Rodney Brooks  subsumption architecture was an early proposal for such a hierarchical system  106   edit  Tools In the course of 50 years of research  AI has developed a large number of tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science  A few of the most general of these methods are discussed below   edit  Search and optimization Main articles  Search algorithm  Mathematical optimization  and Evolutionary computation Many problems in AI can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions  107 Reasoning can be reduced to performing a search  For example  logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions  where each step is the application of an inference rule  108 Planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals  attempting to find a path to a target goal  a process called means ends analysis  109 Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space  69  Many learning algorithms use search algorithms based on optimization  Simple exhaustive searches 110  are rarely sufficient for most real world problems  the search space  the number of places to search  quickly grows to astronomical numbers  The result is a search that is too slow or never completes  The solution  for many problems  is to use  heuristics  or  rules of thumb  that eliminate choices that are unlikely to lead to the goal  called  pruning the search tree    Heuristics supply the program with a  best guess  for the path on which the solution lies  111  A very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s  based on the mathematical theory of optimization  For many problems  it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made  These algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing  we begin the search at a random point on the landscape  and then  by jumps or steps  we keep moving our guess uphill  until we reach the top  Other optimization algorithms are simulated annealing  beam search and random optimization  112  Evolutionary computation uses a form of optimization search  For example  they may begin with a population of organisms  the guesses  and then allow them to mutate and recombine  selecting only the fittest to survive each generation  refining the guesses   Forms of evolutionary computation include swarm intelligence algorithms  such as ant colony or particle swarm optimization  113  and evolutionary algorithms  such as genetic algorithms and genetic programming   114   edit  Logic Main articles  Logic programming and Automated reasoning Logic 115  is used for knowledge representation and problem solving  but it can be applied to other problems as well  For example  the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning 116  and inductive logic programming is a method for learning  117  Several different forms of logic are used in AI research  Propositional or sentential logic 118  is the logic of statements which can be true or false  First order logic 119  also allows the use of quantifiers and predicates  and can express facts about objects  their properties  and their relations with each other  Fuzzy logic  120  is a version of first order logic which allows the truth of a statement to be represented as a value between 0 and 1  rather than simply True  1  or False  0   Fuzzy systems can be used for uncertain reasoning and have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer product control systems  Subjective logic 121  models uncertainty in a different and more explicit manner than fuzzy logic  a given binomial opinion satisfies belief   disbelief   uncertainty   1 within a Beta distribution  By this method  ignorance can be distinguished from probabilistic statements that an agent makes with high confidence  Default logics  non monotonic logics and circumscription 51  are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the qualification problem  Several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of knowledge  such as  description logics  45 situation calculus  event calculus and fluent calculus  for representing events and time   46 causal calculus  47  belief calculus  and modal logics  48   edit  Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning Main articles  Bayesian network  Hidden Markov model  Kalman filter  Decision theory  and Utility theory Many problems in AI  in reasoning  planning  learning  perception and robotics  require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information  AI researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics  122  Bayesian networks 123  are a very general tool that can be used for a large number of problems  reasoning  using the Bayesian inference algorithm   124 learning  using the expectation maximization algorithm   125 planning  using decision networks  126  and perception  using dynamic Bayesian networks   127  Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering  prediction  smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data  helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time  e g   hidden Markov models or Kalman filters   127  A key concept from the science of economics is  utility   a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent  Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan  using decision theory  decision analysis  128 information value theory  57  These tools include models such as Markov decision processes  129  dynamic decision networks  127 game theory and mechanism design  130   edit  Classifiers and statistical learning methods Main articles  Classifier  mathematics   Statistical classification  and Machine learning The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types  classifiers   if shiny then diamond   and controllers   if shiny then pick up    Controllers do however also classify conditions before inferring actions  and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems  Classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine a closest match  They can be tuned according to examples  making them very attractive for use in AI  These examples are known as observations or patterns  In supervised learning  each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class  A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made  All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set  When a new observation is received  that observation is classified based on previous experience  131  A classifier can be trained in various ways  there are many statistical and machine learning approaches  The most widely used classifiers are the neural network  132 kernel methods such as the support vector machine  133 k nearest neighbor algorithm  134 Gaussian mixture model  135 naive Bayes classifier  136  and decision tree  137  The performance of these classifiers have been compared over a wide range of tasks  Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified  There is no single classifier that works best on all given problems  this is also referred to as the  no free lunch  theorem  Determining a suitable classifier for a given problem is still more an art than science  138   edit  Neural networks Main articles  Neural network and Connectionism A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes  akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain  The study of artificial neural networks 132  began in the decade before the field AI research was founded  in the work of Walter Pitts and Warren McCullough  Other important early researchers were Frank Rosenblatt  who invented the perceptron and Paul Werbos who developed the backpropagation algorithm  139  The main categories of networks are acyclic or feedforward neural networks  where the signal passes in only one direction  and recurrent neural networks  which allow feedback   Among the most popular feedforward networks are perceptrons  multi layer perceptrons and radial basis networks  140  Among recurrent networks  the most famous is the Hopfield net  a form of attractor network  which was first described by John Hopfield in 1982  141  Neural networks can be applied to the problem of intelligent control  for robotics  or learning  using such techniques as Hebbian learning and competitive learning  142  Hierarchical temporal memory is an approach that models some of the structural and algorithmic properties of the neocortex  143   edit  Control theory Main article  Intelligent control Control theory  the grandchild of cybernetics  has many important applications  especially in robotics  144   edit  Languages Main article  List of programming languages for artificial intelligence AI researchers have developed several specialized languages for AI research  including Lisp 145  and Prolog  146   edit  Evaluating progress Main article  Progress in artificial intelligence In 1950  Alan Turing proposed a general procedure to test the intelligence of an agent now known as the Turing test  This procedure allows almost all the major problems of artificial intelligence to be tested  However  it is a very difficult challenge and at present all agents fail  147  Artificial intelligence can also be evaluated on specific problems such as small problems in chemistry  hand writing recognition and game playing  Such tests have been termed subject matter expert Turing tests  Smaller problems provide more achievable goals and there are an ever increasing number of positive results  148  The broad classes of outcome for an AI test are   1  Optimal  it is not possible to perform better   2  Strong super human  performs better than all humans   3  Super human  performs better than most humans   4  Sub human  performs worse than most humans  citation needed  For example  performance at draughts is optimal  149  performance at chess is super human and nearing strong super human  see Computer chess Computers versus humans  and performance at many everyday tasks  such as recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into something  is sub human  A quite different approach measures machine intelligence through tests which are developed from mathematical definitions of intelligence  Examples of these kinds of tests start in the late nineties devising intelligence tests using notions from Kolmogorov complexity and data compression  150  Two major advantages of mathematical definitions are their applicability to nonhuman intelligences and their absence of a requirement for human testers   edit  Applications An automated online assistant providing customer service on a web page   one of many very primitive applications of artificial intelligence  This section requires expansion  See the talk page  Main article  Applications of artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list  Frequently  when a technique reaches mainstream use  it is no longer considered artificial intelligence  this phenomenon is described as the AI effect  151   edit  Competitions and prizes Main article  Competitions and prizes in artificial intelligence There are a number of competitions and prizes to promote research in artificial intelligence  The main areas promoted are  general machine intelligence  conversational behavior  data mining  driverless cars  robot soccer and games   edit  Platforms A platform  or  computing platform   is defined as  some sort of hardware architecture or software framework  including application frameworks   that allows software to run   As Rodney Brooks 152  pointed out many years ago  it is not just the artificial intelligence software that defines the AI features of the platform  but rather the actual platform itself that affects the AI that results  i e   there needs to be work in AI problems on real world platforms rather than in isolation  A wide variety of platforms has allowed different aspects of AI to develop  ranging from expert systems  albeit PC based but still an entire real world system  to various robot platforms such as the widely available Roomba with open interface  153   edit  Philosophy Main article  Philosophy of artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence  by claiming to be able to recreate the capabilities of the human mind  is both a challenge and an inspiration for philosophy  Are there limits to how intelligent machines can be  Is there an essential difference between human intelligence and artificial intelligence  Can a machine have a mind and consciousness  A few of the most influential answers to these questions are given below  154  Turing s  polite convention   We need not decide if a machine can  think   we need only decide if a machine can act as intelligently as a human being  This approach to the philosophical problems associated with artificial intelligence forms the basis of the Turing test  147  The Dartmouth proposal   Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it   This conjecture was printed in the proposal for the Dartmouth Conference of 1956  and represents the position of most working AI researchers  155  Newell and Simon s physical symbol system hypothesis   A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action   Newell and Simon argue that intelligences consist of formal operations on symbols  156 Hubert Dreyfus argued that  on the contrary  human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a  feel  for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge   See Dreyfus  critique of AI   157  158  G del s incompleteness theorem  A formal system  such as a computer program  cannot prove all true statements  159 Roger Penrose is among those who claim that G del s theorem limits what machines can do   See The Emperor s New Mind   160  Searle s strong AI hypothesis   The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds   161  John Searle counters this assertion with his Chinese room argument  which asks us to look inside the computer and try to find where the  mind  might be  162  The artificial brain argument  The brain can be simulated  Hans Moravec  Ray Kurzweil and others have argued that it is technologically feasible to copy the brain directly into hardware and software  and that such a simulation will be essentially identical to the original  82   edit  Predictions and ethics Main articles  Artificial intelligence in fiction  Ethics of artificial intelligence  Transhumanism  and Technological singularity Artificial Intelligence is a common topic in both science fiction and projections about the future of technology and society  The existence of an artificial intelligence that rivals human intelligence raises difficult ethical issues  and the potential power of the technology inspires both hopes and fears  In fiction  Artificial Intelligence has appeared fulfilling many roles  including a servant  R2D2 in Star Wars   a law enforcer  K I T T   Knight Rider    a comrade  Lt  Commander Data in Star Trek  The Next Generation   a conqueror overlord  The Matrix   a dictator  With Folded Hands   a benevolent provider de facto ruler  The Culture   an assassin  Terminator   a sentient race  Battlestar Galactica Transformers   an extension to human abilities  Ghost in the Shell  and the savior of the human race  R  Daneel Olivaw in Isaac Asimov s Robot Series   Mary Shelley s Frankenstein considers a key issue in the ethics of artificial intelligence  if a machine can be created that has intelligence  could it also feel  If it can feel  does it have the same rights as a human  The idea also appears in modern science fiction  including the films I Robot  Blade Runner and A I   Artificial Intelligence  in which humanoid machines have the ability to feel human emotions  This issue  now known as  robot rights   is currently being considered by  for example  California s Institute for the Future  although many critics believe that the discussion is premature  163  The subject is profoundly discussed in the 2010 documentary film Plug  amp  Pray  164  Martin Ford  author of The Lights in the Tunnel  Automation  Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future  165  and others argue that specialized artificial intelligence applications  robotics and other forms of automation will ultimately result in significant unemployment as machines begin to match and exceed the capability of workers to perform most routine and repetitive jobs  Ford predicts that many knowledge based occupations and in particular entry level jobs will be increasingly susceptible to automation via expert systems  machine learning 166  and other AI enhanced applications  AI based applications may also be used to amplify the capabilities of low wage offshore workers  making it more feasible to outsource knowledge work  167  Joseph Weizenbaum wrote that AI applications can not  by definition  successfully simulate genuine human empathy and that the use of AI technology in fields such as customer service or psychotherapy 168  was deeply misguided  Weizenbaum was also bothered that AI researchers  and some philosophers  were willing to view the human mind as nothing more than a computer program  a position now known as computationalism   To Weizenbaum these points suggest that AI research devalues human life  169  Many futurists believe that artificial intelligence will ultimately transcend the limits of progress  Ray Kurzweil has used Moore s law  which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology  to calculate that desktop computers will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029  He also predicts that by 2045 artificial intelligence will reach a point where it is able to improve itself at a rate that far exceeds anything conceivable in the past  a scenario that science fiction writer Vernor Vinge named the  singularity   170  Robot designer Hans Moravec  cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either  171  This idea  called transhumanism  which has roots in Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger  has been illustrated in fiction as well  for example in the manga Ghost in the Shell and the science fiction series Dune  Edward Fredkin argues that  artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution   an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler s  Darwin among the Machines   1863   and expanded upon by George Dyson in his book of the same name in 1998  172  Pamela McCorduck writes that all these scenarios are expressions of the ancient human desire to  as she calls it   forge the gods   6   edit  See also AI portal Mind and Brain portal Chess portal Strategy games portal
