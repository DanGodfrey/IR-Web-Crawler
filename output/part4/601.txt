revenue as a percentage of GDP for the U S  over the past several decades compared to other first world nations  The United States has an assortment of federal  state  local  and special purpose governmental jurisdictions  Each imposes taxes to fully or partly fund its operations  These taxes may be imposed on the same income  property or activity  often without offset of one tax against another  The types of tax imposed at each level of government vary  in part due to constitutional restrictions  Income taxes are imposed at the federal and most state levels  Taxes on property are typically imposed only at the local level  though there may be multiple local jurisdictions that tax the same property  Excise taxes are imposed by the federal and some state governments  Sales taxes are imposed by most states and many local governments  Customs duties or tariffs are only imposed by the federal government  A wide variety of other taxes  some called user or license fees  are imposed   edit  Types of taxpayers Taxes may be imposed on individuals  natural persons   business entities  estates  trusts  or other forms of organization  Taxes may be based on property  income  transactions  importation of goods  business activity  or a variety of factors  and are generally imposed on the type of taxpayer for whom such tax base is relevant  Thus  property taxes tend to be imposed on property owners  In addition  certain taxes  particularly income taxes  may be imposed on the members of organizations for the organization s activities  Thus  partners are taxed on the income of their partnership  With few exceptions  one level of government does not impose tax on another level of government or its instrumentalities   edit  Income tax Total tax revenue  not adjusted

income is reduced by tax deductions including most business and some nonbusiness expenses  Individuals are also allowed a deduction for personal exemptions  a fixed dollar allowance  The allowance of some nonbusiness deductions is phased out at higher income levels  The U S  federal and most state income tax systems tax the worldwide income of residents  2  A federal foreign tax credit is granted for foreign income taxes  Individuals may also claim the foreign earned income exclusion  Individuals may be a citizen or resident of the United States but not a resident of a state  Many states grant a similar credit for taxes paid to other states  These credits are generally limited to the amount of tax on income from foreign  or other state  sources   edit  Filing status Main article  Filing

Main article  Gross income Main article  Tax exemption Exempt income Taxable income is gross income  5  less adjustments and allowable tax deductions  6  Gross income for federal and most states is

the value received or which the taxpayer has a right to receive  Certain types of income are specifically excluded from gross income  The time at which gross income becomes taxable is determined under federal tax rules  This may differ in some cases from accounting rules  7  Certain types of income are excluded from gross income  and therefore subject to tax exemption   8  The exclusions differ at federal and state levels  For federal income tax  interest income on state and local bonds is exempt  while few states exempt any interest income except from municipalities within that state  In addition  certain types of receipts  such as gifts and inheritances  and certain types of benefits  such as employer provided health insurance  are excluded from income  Foreign persons are taxed only on income from U S  sources or from a U S  business  Tax on foreign persons on non business income is at 30  of the gross income  but reduced under many tax treaties   edit  Deductions and exemptions Main article  Tax deduction The U S  system allows reduction of taxable income for both business 9  and some nonbusiness 10  expenditures  called deductions  Businesses selling goods reduce gross income directly by the cost of goods sold  In addition  businesses may deduct most types of expenses incurred in the business  Some of these deductions are subject to limitations  For example  only 50  of the amount incurred for any meals or entertainment may be deducted  11  The amount and timing of deductions for business expenses is determined under the taxpayer s tax accounting method  which may differ from methods used in accounting records  12  Some types of business expenses are deductible over a period of years rather than when incurred  These include the cost of long lived assets such as buildings and equipment  The cost of such assets is recovered through deductions for depreciation or amortization  In addition to business expenses  individuals may reduce income by an allowance for personal exemptions  13  and either a fixed standard deduction or itemized deductions  14  One personal exemption is allowed per taxpayer  and additional such deductions are allowed for each child or certain other individuals supported by the taxpayer  The standard deduction amount varies by taxpayer filing status  Itemized deductions by individuals include home mortgage interest  property taxes  certain other taxes  contributions to recognized charities  medical expenses in excess of 7 5  of adjusted gross income  and certain other amounts  Personal exemptions  the standard deduction  and itemized deductions are limited  phased out  above certain income levels  15   edit  Business entities Main articles  Corporate tax in the United States  S corporations  and Partnership taxation in the United States Corporations must pay tax on their taxable income independently of their shareholders  16  Shareholders are also subject to tax on dividends received from corporations  17  By contrast  partnerships are not subject to income tax  but their partners calculate their taxes by including their shares of partnership items  18  Corporations owned entirely by U S  citizens or residents  S corporations  may elect to be treated similarly to partnerships  A Limited Liability Company and certain other business entities may elect to be treated as corporations or as partnerships  19  States generally follow such characterization  Many states also allow corporations to elect S corporation status  Charitable organizations are subject to tax on business income  20  Certain transactions of business entities are not subject to tax  These include many types of formation or reorganization  21   edit  Credits Main article  Tax credit A wide variety of tax credits may reduce income tax at the Federal 22  and state levels  Some credits are available only to individuals  such as the child tax credit for each dependent child or the Earned Income Tax Credit for low income wage earners  Some credits  such as the Work Opportunity Tax Credit  are available to businesses  including various special industry incentives  A few credits  such as the foreign tax credit  are available to all types of taxpayers   edit  Payment or withholding of taxes Main article  Withholding tax The United States Federal and state income tax systems are self assessment systems  Taxpayers must declare and pay tax without assessment by the taxing authority  Quarterly payments of tax estimated to be due are required to the extent taxes are not paid through withholdings  23

on Form W 4  with limited government review  25   edit  State variations Main article  State income tax 43 states and many localities in the United States impose an income tax on individuals  47 states and many localities impose a tax on the income of corporations  Tax rates vary by state and locality  and may be fixed or graduated  Most rates are the same for all types of income  State and local income taxes are imposed in addition to Federal income tax  State income tax is allowed as a deduction in computing Federal income tax  subject to limitations for individuals  State and local taxable income is determined under state law  and often is based on Federal taxable income  Most states conform to many Federal concepts and definitions  including defining income and business deductions and timing thereof  26  State rules vary widely with regard to individual itemized deductions  Most states do not allow a deduction for state income taxes for individuals or corporations  and impose tax on certain types of income exempt at the Federal level  Some states have alternative measures of taxable income  or alternative taxes  especially for corporations  States imposing an income tax generally tax all income of corporations organized in the state and individuals residing in the state  Taxpayers from another state are subject to tax only on income earned in the state or apportioned to the state  Businesses are subject to income tax in a state only if they have sufficient nexus in  connection to  the state   edit  Nonresidents Individuals and corporations not resident in the United States are subject to Federal income tax only on income from a U S  business and certain types of income from U S  sources  27  States tax individuals resident outside the state and corporations organized outside the state only on wages or business income within the state  Payers of some types of income to nonresidents must withhold Federal or state income tax on the payment  Federal withholding of 30  on such income may be reduced under a tax treaty  Such treaties do not apply to state taxes   edit  Alternative tax bases  AMT  states  An Alternative Minimum Tax  AMT  is imposed at the Federal level on a somewhat modified version of taxable income  28  The tax applies to individuals and corporations  The tax base is adjusted gross income reduced by a fixed deduction

of 26  or 28  for individuals and 20  for corporations  less the amount of regular tax  A credit against future regular income tax is allowed for such excess  with certain restrictions  Many states impose minimum income taxes on corporations and or a tax computed on an alternative tax base  These include taxes based on capital of corporations and alternative measures of income for individuals  Details vary widely by state   edit  Differences between book and taxable income for businesses In the United States  taxable income is computed under rules that differ materially from U S  generally accepted accounting principles  Since only publicly traded companies are required to prepare financial statements  many non public companies opt to keep their financial records under tax rules  Corporations that present financial statements using other than tax rules must include a detailed reconciliation of their financial statement income to their taxable income as part of their tax returns  Key areas of difference include depreciation and amortization  timing of recognition of income or deductions  assumptions for cost of goods sold  and certain items  such as meals and entertainment  the tax deduction for which is limited   edit  Reporting under self assessment system Main article  Tax return  United States  Income taxes in the United States are self assessed by taxpayers  29  by filing required tax returns  30  Taxpayers  as well as certain non taxpaying entities like partnerships  must file annual tax returns at the Federal and applicable state levels  These returns disclose a complete computation of taxable income under tax principles  Taxpayers compute all income  deductions  and credits themselves  and determine the amount of tax due after applying required prepayments and taxes withheld  Federal and state tax authorities provide preprinted forms that must be used to file tax returns  IRS Form 1040 series of forms is required for individuals  and Form 1120 series of forms for corporations  and Form 1065 for partnerships  The state forms vary widely  and rarely correspond to Federal forms  Tax returns vary from the two page  Form 1040EZ  used by nearly 70  of individual filers to thousands of pages of forms and attachments for large entities  Groups of corporations may elect to file consolidated returns at the Federal level and with a few states  Electronic filing of Federal and many state returns is widely encouraged and in some cases required  and many vendors offer computer software for use by taxpayers and paid return preparers to prepare and electronically file returns   edit  Payroll taxes In the United States  payroll taxes are assessed by the federal government  all fifty states  the District of Columbia  and numerous cities  These taxes are imposed on employers and employees and on various compensation bases  They are collected and paid to the taxing jurisdiction by the employers  Most jurisdictions

article  Tax withholding in the United States Federal  state  and local withholding taxes are required in those jurisdictions imposing an income tax  Employers having contact with the jurisdiction must withhold the tax from wages paid to their employees in those jurisdictions  32  Computation of the amount of tax to withhold is performed by the employer based on representations by the employee regarding his her tax status on IRS Form W 4  33  Amounts of income tax so withheld must be paid to the taxing jurisdiction  and are available as refundable tax credits to the employees  Income taxes withheld from payroll are not final taxes  merely prepayments  Employees must still file income tax returns and self assess tax  claiming amounts withheld as payments  34   edit  Social Security and Medicare taxes Main article  Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax Federal social insurance taxes are imposed equally on employers 35  and employees  36  consisting of a tax of 6 2  of wages up to an annual wage maximum   106 800 in 2010  for Social Security plus a tax of 1 45  of total wages for Medicare  37  For 2011  the employee s contribution was reduced to 4 2   while the employer s portion remained at 6 2   38  To the extent an employee s portion of the 6 2  tax exceeds the maximum by reason of multiple employers  the employee is entitled to a refundable tax credit upon filing an income tax return for the year  39   edit  Unemployment taxes Main article  Federal Unemployment Tax Act Employers are subject to unemployment taxes by the federal 40  and all state governments  The tax is a percentage of taxable wages 41  with a cap  The tax rate and cap vary by jurisdiction and by employer s industry and experience rating  For 2009  the typical maximum tax per employee was under  1 000  42  Some states also impose unemployment  disability insurance  or similar taxes on employees  43   edit  Reporting and payment Employers must report payroll taxes to the appropriate taxing jurisdiction in the manner each jurisdiction provides  Quarterly reporting of aggregate income tax withholding and Social Security taxes is required in most jurisdictions  44  Employers must

to the taxing jurisdiction under varying rules  in many cases within 1 banking day  Payment of Federal and many state payroll taxes is required to be made by electronic funds transfer if certain dollar thresholds are met  or by deposit with a bank for the benefit of the taxing jurisdiction  48   edit  Penalties Failure to timely and properly pay federal payroll taxes results in an automatic penalty of 2  to 10   49  Similar state and local penalties apply  Failure to properly file monthly or quarterly returns may result in additional penalties  Failure to file Forms W 2 results in an automatic penalty of up to  50 per form not timely filed  50  State and local penalties vary by jurisdiction  A particularly severe penalty applies where federal income tax withholding and Social Security taxes are not paid to the IRS  The penalty of up to 100  of the amount not paid can be assessed against the employer entity as well as any person  such as a corporate officer  having control or custody of the funds from which payment should have been made  51   edit  Sales and excise taxes  edit  Sales and use tax Main article  Sales taxes in the United States There is no Federal sales or use tax in the United States  All but five states impose sales and use taxes on retail sale  lease and rental of many goods  as well as some services  Many cities  counties  transit authorities and special purpose districts impose an additional local sales or use tax  Sales and use tax is calculated as the purchase price times the appropriate tax rate  Tax rates vary widely by jurisdiction from less than 1  to over 10   Sales tax is collected by the seller at the time of sale  Use tax is self assessed by a buyer who has not paid sales tax on a taxable purchase  Unlike value added tax  sales tax is imposed only once  at the retail level  on any particular goods  Nearly all jurisdictions provide numerous categories of goods and services that are exempt from sales tax  or taxed at a reduced rate  Purchase of goods for further manufacture or for resale is uniformly exempt from sales tax  Most jurisdictions exempt food sold in grocery stores  prescription medications  and many agricultural supplies  Generally cash discounts  including coupons  are not included in the price used in computing tax  Sales taxes  including those imposed by local governments  are generally administered at the state level  States imposing sales tax require retail sellers to register with the state  collect tax from customers  file returns  and remit the tax to the state  Procedural rules vary widely  Sellers generally must collect tax from in state purchasers unless the purchaser provides an exemption certificate  Most states allow or require electronic remittance of tax to the state  States are prohibited from requiring out of state sellers to collect tax unless the seller has some minimal connection with the state  52   edit  Excise taxes Main article  Excise tax in the United States Excise taxes may be imposed on the sales price of goods or on a per unit or other basis  Excise tax may be required to be paid by the manufacturer at wholesale sale  or may be collected from the customer at retail sale  Excise taxes are imposed at the Federal and state levels on a variety of goods  including alcohol  tobacco  tires  gasoline  diesel fuel  coal  firearms  telephone service  air transportation  unregistered bonds  and many other goods and services  Some jurisdictions require that tax stamps be affixed to goods to demonstrate payment of the tax   edit  Property taxes Main article  Property tax in the United States Most jurisdictions below the state level in the United States impose a tax on interests in real property  land  buildings  and permanent improvements   Some jurisdictions also tax some types of business personal property  53  Rules vary widely by jurisdiction  54  Many overlapping jurisdictions  counties  cities  school districts  may have authority to tax the same property  55  Few states impose a tax on the value of property  Property tax is based on fair market value of the subject property  The amount of tax is determined annually based on the market value of each property on a particular date  56  and most jurisdictions require redeterminations of value periodically  The tax is computed as the determined market value times an assessment ratio times the tax rate  57  Assessment ratios and tax rates vary widely among jurisdictions  and may vary by type of property within a jurisdiction  58  Where a property has recently been sold between unrelated sellers  such sale establishes fair market value  In other  i e   most  cases  the value must be estimated  Common estimation techniques include comparable sales  depreciated cost  and an income approach  Property owners may also declare a value  which is subject to change by the tax assessor   edit  Types of property taxed Property taxes are most commonly applied to real estate and business property  Real property generally includes all interests considered under that state s law to be ownership interests in land  buildings  and improvements  Ownership interests include ownership of title as well as certain other rights to property  Automobile and boat registration fees are a subset of this tax  Usually  other nonbusiness goods are not subject to property tax   edit  Assessment and collection The assessment process varies by state  and sometimes within a state  Each taxing jurisdiction determines values of property within the jurisdiction and then determines the amount of tax to assess based on the value of the property  Tax assessors for taxing jurisdictions are generally responsible for determining property values  The determination of values and calculation of tax is generally performed by an official referred to as a tax assessor  Property owners have rights in each jurisdiction to declare or contest the value so determined  Property values generally must be coordinated among jurisdictions  and such coordination is often performed by a board of equalization  Once value is determined  the assessor typically notifies the last known property owner of the value determination  After values are settled  property tax bills or notices are sent to property owners  59  Payment times and terms vary widely  If a property owner fails to pay the tax  the taxing jurisdiction has various remedies for collection  in many cases including seizure and sale of the property  Property taxes constitute a lien on the property to which transferes are also subject  Mortgage companies often collect taxes from property owners and remit them on behalf of the owner   edit  Customs duties The United States imposes tariffs or customs duties on imports of goods  The duty is levied at the time of import and is paid by the importer of record  Customs duties vary by country of origin and product  Goods from many countries are exempt from duty under various trade agreements  Certain types of goods are exempt from duty regardless of source  Customs rules differ from other import restrictions  Failure to properly comply with customs rules can result in seizure of goods and criminal penalties against involved parties  United States Customs and Border Protection   CBP   enforces customs rules   edit  Import of goods Goods may be imported to the United States subject to import restrictions  Importers of goods may be subject to tax   customs duty  or  tariff   on the imported value of the goods   Imported goods are not legally entered until after the shipment has arrived within the port of entry  delivery of the merchandise has been authorized by CBP  and estimated duties have been paid   60  Importation and declaration and payment of customs duties is done by the importer of record  which may be the owner of the goods  the purchaser  or a licensed customs broker  Goods may be stored in a bonded warehouse or a Foreign Trade Zone in the United States for up to five years without payment of duties  Goods must be declared for entry into the U S  within 15 days of arrival or prior to leaving a bonded warehouse or foreign trade zone  Many importers participate in a voluntary self assessment program with CBP  Special rules apply to goods imported by mail  All goods imported into the United States are subject to inspection by CBP  Some goods may be temporarily imported to the United States under a system similar to the ATA Carnet system  Examples include laptop computers used by persons traveling in the U S  and samples used by salesmen   edit  Origin Rates of tax on transaction values vary by country of origin  Goods must be individually labeled to indicate country of origin  with exceptions for specific types of goods  Goods are considered to originate in the country with the highest rate of duties for the particular goods unless the goods meet certain minimum content requirements  Extensive modifications to normal duties and classifications apply to goods originating in Canada or Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement   edit  Classification All goods that are not exempt are subject to duty computed according to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule published by CBP and the U S  International Trade Commission  This lengthy schedule 61  provides rates of duty for each class of goods  Most goods are classified based on the nature of the goods  though some classifications are based on use   edit  Duty rate Customs duty rates may be expressed as a percentage of value or dollars and cents per unit  Rates based on value vary from zero to 20  in the 2011 schedule  62  Rates may be based on relevant units for the particular type of goods  per ton  per kilogram  per square meter  etc    Some duties are based in part on value and in part on quantity  Where goods subject to different rates of duty are commingled  the entire shipment may be taxed at the highest applicable duty rate  63   edit  Procedures Imported goods are generally accompanied by a bill of lading or air waybill describing the goods  For purposes of customs duty assessment  they must also be accompanied by an invoice documenting the transaction value  The goods on the bill of lading and invoice are classified and duty is computed by the importer or CBP  The amount of this duty is payable immediately  and must be paid before the goods can be imported  Most assessments of goods are now done by the importer and documentation filed with CBP electronically  After duties have been paid  CBP approves the goods for import  They can then be removed from the port of entry  bonded warehouse  or Free Trade Zone  After duty has been paid on particular goods  the importer can seek a refund of duties if the goods are exported without substantial modification  The process of claiming a refund is known as duty drawback   edit  Penalties Certain civil penalties apply for failures to follow CBP rules and pay duty  Goods of persons subject to such penalties may be seized and sold by CBP  In addition  criminal penalties may apply for certain offenses  Criminal penalties may be as high as twice the value of the goods plus twenty years in jail   edit  Foreign Trade Zones Foreign trade Zones are secure areas physically in the United States but legally outside the customs territory of the United States  Such zones are generally near ports of entry  They may be within the warehouse of an importer  Such zones are limited in scope and operation based on approval of the Foreign Trade Zones Board  Goods in a Foreign Trade Zone are not considered imported to the United States until they leave the Zone  Foreign goods may be used to manufacture other goods within the zone for export without payment of customs duties  64   edit  Estate and gift tax Main articles  Estate tax in the United States  Gift tax in the United States  and Generation skipping transfer tax Estate and gift taxes in the United States are imposed by the Federal and most state governments  65  The estate tax is an excise tax levied on the right to pass property at death  It is imposed on the estate  not the beneficiary  Some states impose an inheritance tax on recipients of bequests  Gift taxes are levied on the giver  donor  of property where the property is transferred for less than adequate consideration  An additional generation skipping transfer  GST  tax is imposed by the Federal and some state governments on transfers to grandchildren  or their descendants   The Federal gift tax is computed based on cumulative taxable gifts  and is reduced by prior gift taxes paid  The Federal estate tax is computed on the sum of taxable estate and taxable gifts  and is reduced by prior gift taxes paid  These taxes are computed as the taxable amount times a graduated tax rate  up to 35  in 2011   The estate and gift taxes are also reduced by a  unified credit  equivalent to an exclusion   5 million in 2011   Rates and exclusions have varied  and the benefits of lower rates and the credit have been phased out during some years  Taxable gifts are certain gifts of U S  property by nonresidents  most gifts of any

a fixed dollar amount per year for the licensee  an amount based on the number of practitioners in the firm  a percentage of revenue  or any of several other bases  Persons providing professional or

offices providing taxpayer services and administering tax examinations   edit  Examination Tax returns filed with the IRS are subject to examination and adjustment  commonly called an IRS audit  Only a small percentage of returns  about 1  of individual returns in IRS FY 2008  are examined each year  The selection of returns uses a variety of methods based on IRS experiences  On examination  the IRS may request additional information from the taxpayer by mail  in person at IRS local offices  or at the business location of the taxpayer  The taxpayer is entitled to representation by an attorney  CPA  or enrolled agent  at the expense of the taxpayer  who may make representations to the IRS on behalf of the taxpayer  Taxpayers have certain rights in an audit  Upon conclusion of the audit  the IRS may accept the tax return as filed or propose adjustments to the return  The IRS may also assess penalties and interest  Generally  adjustments must be proposed within three years of the due date

authority to seize and dispose of cargo in the case of certain violations of customs rules   edit  State administrations Every state in the United States has its own tax administration  subject to the rules of that state s law and regulations  These are referred to in most states as the Department of Revenue or Department of Taxation  The powers of the state taxing authorities vary widely  Most enforce all state level taxes but not most local taxes  However  many states have unified state level sales tax administration  including for local sales taxes  State tax returns are filed separately with those tax administrations  not with the Federal tax administrations  Each state has its own procedural rules  which vary widely   edit  Local administrations Most localities within the United States administer most of their own taxes  In many cases  there are multiple local taxing jurisdictions with respect to a particular taxpayer or property  For property taxes  the taxing jurisdiction is typically represented by a tax assessor collector whose offices are located at the taxing jurisdiction s facilities   edit  Legal basis The United States Constitution provides that Congress  shall have the power to lay and collect Taxes  Duties  Imposts  and Excises     but all Duties  Imposts  and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States   68  Prior to amendment  it provided that  No Capitation  or other direct  Tax shall be Laid unless in proportion to the Census      The 16th Amendment provided that  Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes on incomes  from whatever source derived  without apportionment among the several States  and without regard to any census or enumeration   The 10th Amendment provided that  powers not delegated to the United States by this Constitution  nor prohibited to the States  are reserved to the States respectively  or to the people   Congress has enacted numerous laws dealing with taxes since adoption of the Constitution  Those laws are now codified as Title 19  Customs Duties  Title 26  Internal Revenue Code  and various other provisions  These laws specifically authorize the United States Secretary of the Treasury to delegate various powers related to levy  assessment and collection of taxes  State constitutions uniformly grant the state government the right to levy and collect taxes  Limitations under state constitutions vary widely  Various individuals and groups have questioned the legitimacy of United States federal income tax  These arguments are varied  but have been uniformly rejected by the Internal Revenue Service and by the courts and ruled to be frivolous  69  70  71   edit  Policy issues Distribution of U S  federal taxes for 2000 as a percentage of income among the family income

percentage of GDP from 1945 to 2015  note that 2010 to 2015 data are estimated  Main article  Taxation history of the United States Before 1776  the American Colonies were subject to taxation by the United Kingdom  and also imposed local taxes  Property taxes were imposed in the Colonies as early as 1634  72  In 1673  the UK Parliament imposed a tax on exports from the American Colonies  and with it created the first tax administration in what would become the United States  73  Other tariffs and taxes were imposed by Parliament  Most of the colonies and many localities adopted property taxes  Under Article VIII of the Articles of Confederation  the United States Federal government did not have the power to tax  All such power lay with the states  The United States Constitution  adopted in 1787  authorized the Federal government to lay and collect taxes  but required that some types of tax revenues be given to the states in proportion to population  Tariffs were the principal Federal tax through the 1800s  By 1796  state and local governments in fourteen of the 15 states taxed land  Delaware taxed the income from property  By the American Civil War  the principle of taxation of property at a uniform rate had developed  and many of the states relied on property taxes as a major source of revenue  However  the increasing importance of intangible property  such as corporate stock  caused the states to shift to other forms of taxation in the 1900s  Income taxes in the form of  faculty  taxes were imposed by the colonies  These combined income and property tax characteristics  and the income element persisted after 1776 in a few states  Several states adopted income taxes in 1837  74  Wisconsin adopted a corporate and individual income tax in 1911  75  and was the first to administer the tax with a state tax administration  The first Federal income tax was adopted as part of the Revenue Act of 1861  76  The tax lapsed after the American Civil War  Subsequently enacted income taxes were held to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court because they were not given to the states  In 1913  the Sixteenth Amendment was ratified  permitting the Federal government to levy an income tax without giving all of it to the states  The Federal income tax enacted in 1913 included corporate and individual income taxes  It defined income using language from prior laws  incorporated in the Sixteenth Amendment  as  all income from whatever source derived   The tax allowed deductions for business expenses  but few non business deductions  In 1918 the income tax law was expanded to include a foreign tax credit and more comprehensive definitions of income and deduction items  Various aspects of the present system of definitions were expanded through 1926  when U S  law was organized as the United States Code  Income  estate  gift  and excise tax provisions  plus provisions relating to tax returns and enforcement  were codified as Title 26  also known as the Internal Revenue Code  This was reorganized and somewhat expanded in 1954  and remains in the same general form  Federal taxes were expanded greatly during World War I  In 1921  wealthy industrialist and then Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon engineered a series of significant income tax cuts under three presidents  Mellon argued that tax cuts would spur growth  77  The last such cut in 1928 was followed by the Great Depression in 1929  Taxes were raised again in the latter part of the Depression  and during World War II  Income tax rates were reduced significantly during the Johnson  Nixon  and Reagan Presidencies  Significant tax cuts for corporations and upper income individuals were enacted during the second Bush Presidency  In 1986  Congress adopted  with little modification  a major expansion of the income tax portion of the Internal Revenue Code proposed in 1985 by the U S  Treasury Department under President Reagan  The thousand page Tax Reform Act of 1986 significantly lowered tax rates  adopted sweeping expansions of international rules  eliminated the lower individual tax rate for capital gains  added significant inventory accounting rules  and made substantial other expansions of the law  Federal income tax rates have been modified frequently  Tax rates were changed in 34 of the 97 years between 1913 and 2010  78  The rate structure has been graduated since the 1913 act  The first individual income tax return Form 1040 under the 1913 law was four pages long  In 1915  some Congressmen complained about the complexity of the form  79  In 1921  Congress considered but did not enact replacement of the income tax with a national sales tax  By the 1920s  many states had adopted income taxes on individuals and corporations  80  Many of the state taxes were simply based on the Federal definitions  The states generally taxed residents on all of their income  including income earned in other states  as well as income of nonresidents earned in the state  This led to a long line of Supreme Court cases limiting the ability of states to tax income of nonresidents  The states had also come to rely heavily on retail sales taxes  However  as of the beginning of World War II  only two cities  New York and New Orleans  had local sales taxes  81  The Federal Estate Tax was introduced in 1916  and Gift Tax in 1924  Unlike many inheritance taxes  the Gift and Estate taxes were imposed on the transferor rather than the recipient  Many states adopted either inheritance taxes or estate and gift taxes  often computed as the amount allowed as a deduction for Federal purposes  These taxes remained under 1  of government revenues through the 1990s  82  All governments within the United States provide tax exemption for some income  property  or persons  These exemptions have their roots both in tax theory  83  Federal and state legislative history  84  and the United States Constitution  85   edit  References   26 USC 1 and 26
