Multiculturalism From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search Monument to Multiculturalism by Francesco Pirelli in Toronto  Canada  Four identical sculptures are located in Buffalo City  South Africa  Changchun  China  Sarajevo  Bosnia and Sydney  Australia Multiculturalism is an ideology that promotes the institutionalisation of communities containing multiple cultures  It is generally applied to the demographic make up of a specific place  usually at the organizational level  e g  schools  businesses  neighborhoods  cities  or nations  In a political context the term is used for a wide variety of meanings  ranging from the advocacy of equal respect to the various cultures in a society  to a policy of promoting the maintenance of cultural diversity  to policies in which people of various ethnic and religious groups are addressed by the authorities as defined by the group they belong to  1  2  A common aspect of many such policies is that they avoid presenting any specific ethnic  religious  or cultural community values as central  3  Multiculturalism is often contrasted with the concepts of assimilationism and has been described as a  salad bowl  or  cultural mosaic  rather than a  melting pot   4  Contents 1 Definition 2 Contemporary Western societies 2 1 Introductory to monoculturalism 2 2 Australia 2 3 Argentina 2 4 Canada 2 5 United

multiculturalism and different countries approach the issue in a variety of manners  5  However two main different and seemingly inconsistent strategies have developed through different Government policies and strategies  6  7  The first focuses on interaction and communication between different cultures  Interactions of cultures provide opportunities for the cultural differences to communicate and interact to create multiculturalism  The second centers on diversity and cultural uniqueness  Cultural isolation can protect the uniqueness of the local culture of a nation or area and also contribute to global cultural diversity  Andrew Heywood distinguishes between two forms of multiculturalism   the term  multiculturalism  has been used in a variety of ways  both descriptive and normative  8  As a descriptive term  it has been taken to refer to cultural diversity   As a normative term  multiculturalism implies a positive endorsement  even celebration  of communal diversity  typically based on either the right of different groups to respect and recognition  or to the alleged benefits to the larger society of moral and cultural diversity   9   edit  Contemporary Western societies Further information  Multiculturalism and Christianity Monument to Multiculturalism by Francesco Pirelli in Sarajevo  Multiculturalism has been official policy in several Western nations since the 1970s  for reasons that varied from country to country  10  11  12  including the fact that many of the great cities of the Western world are increasingly made of a mosaic of cultures  13  The Canadian government has often been described as the instigator of multicultural ideology because of its public emphasis on the social importance of immigration  14  The Canadian Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism is often refereed to as the origins of modern political awareness of multiculturalism  15  In the Western English speaking countries  multiculturalism as an official national policy started in Canada in 1971  followed by Australia  where it has since been displaced by assimilation  in 1973  16  It was quickly adopted as official policy by most member states of the European Union  Recently  right of center governments in several European states notably the Netherlands and Denmark  have reversed the national policy and returned to an official monoculturalism  16  A similar reversal is the subject of debate in the United Kingdom  among others  due to evidence of incipient segregation and anxieties over  home grown  terrorism  17  Several heads of state have expressed doubts about the success of multicultural policies  The United Kingdom s Prime Minister David Cameron  German Chancellor Angela Merkel  Australia s ex prime minister John Howard  Spanish ex premier Jose Maria Aznar and French President Nicolas Sarkozy have voiced concerns about the effectiveness of their multicultural policies for integrating immigrants  18  19   edit  Introductory to monoculturalism Multiculturalism  as generally understood  refers to a theoretical approach and a number of policies adopted in Western nation states  which had seemingly achieved a de facto single national identity during the 18th and or 19th centuries  20  Many nation states in Africa  Asia  and the Americas are culturally diverse  and are  multi cultural  in a descriptive sense  In some  communalism is a major political issue  The policies adopted by these states often have parallels with multicultural ist policies in the Western world  but the historical background is different  and the goal may be a mono cultural or mono ethnic nation building   for instance in the Malaysian government s attempt to create a  Malaysian race  by 2020  21   edit  Australia Main article  Multiculturalism in Australia Australian Government poster issued by the Overseas Settlement Office to attract immigrants  1928   The next country to adopt an official policy of multiculturalism after Canada was Australia  a country with similar immigration situations had similar policies  for example the formation of the Special Broadcasting Service  22  The White Australia Policy was quietly dismantled after World War II by various changes to immigration policy  the full political introduction of official policies of multiculturalism was not until 1972  23  The election of John Howard s Liberal National Coalition government in 1996 was a major watershed for Australian multiculturalism  Howard had long been a critic of multiculturalism  releasing his One Australia policy in the late 1980s  24  A Practical Reference to Religious Diversity for Operational Police and Emergency Services was a publication of the Australasian Police Multicultural Advisory Bureau designed to offer guidance to police and emergency services personnel on how religious affiliation can affect their contact with the public  The first edition was published in 1999  25  26  27  The first edition covered Buddhist  Hindu  Islamic  Jewish and Sikh faiths with participation of representatives of the various religions  28  The second edition added Christian  Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander religions and the Bah    Faith to the list of religions was published in 2002  29  The overall level of immigration to Australia has grown during the last decades  Net overseas immagrants increased from 30 000 in 1993 30  to 118 000 in 2003 04  31  During the 2004 05  total 123 424 people immigrated to Australia  According to the 2006 census more than one fifth of the population were born overseas  22  Furthermore  almost 50  of the population were either  born overseas  and or had one or both parents born overseas  22   edit  Argentina Main article  Demographics of Argentina Though not called Multiculturalism as such  the preamble of Argentina s constitution explicitly promotes immigration  and recognizes the individual s multiple citizenship from other countries  Though 97  of Argentina s population self identify as of European descent 32  33  to this day a high level of multiculturalism remains a feature of the Argentine s culture  34  allowing foreign festivals and holidays  e g  Saint Patrick s Day   supporting all kinds of art or cultural expression from ethnic groups  as well as their diffusion through an important multicultural presence in the media  for instance it is not uncommon to find newspapers 35  or radio programs in English  German  Italian or French in Argentina   edit  Canada Political cartoon on Canada s multicultural identity  from 1911 Main article  Multiculturalism in Canada Multiculturalism  a Just Society  was adopted as the official policy of the Canadian government during the premiership of Pierre Elliot Trudeau in the 1970s and 1980s  36  Multiculturalism is reflected in the law through the Canadian Multiculturalism Act 37  and section 27 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  38  The Broadcasting Act of 1991 asserts the Canadian broadcasting system should reflect the diversity of cultures in the country  39  40  Canadian society is often depicted as being  very progressive  diverse  and multicultural   41  Canadian political parties are cautious about criticizing their country s high level of immigration  because  as noted by the Globe and Mail   in the early 1990s  the old Reform Party was branded  racist  for suggesting that immigration levels be lowered from 250 000 to 150 000   42  By the 1990s and 2000s  the largest component of Canada s immigrants came from Asia  including the Middle East  South Asia  South East Asia and East Asia  43  In 2001  approximately 250 640 people immigrated to Canada  mostly settling in the major urban areas of Toronto  Vancouver  Ottawa and Montreal  44  In a 2002 interview with the Globe and Mail   Kar m al Hussain  the 49th Aga Khan of the Ismaili Muslims described Canada as  the most successful pluralist society on the face of our globe   citing it as  a model for the world   45  He explained that the experience of Canadian governance   its commitment to pluralism and its support for the rich multicultural diversity of its peoples   is something that must be shared and would be of benefit to all societies in other parts of the world  45   edit  United States See also  Multicultural education In the United States  multiculturalism is not clearly established in policy at the federal level  Instead  it has been an issue primarily through the school system  with the rise of ethnic studies programs in higher education and with attempts to make the grade school curricula more inclusive of the history and contributions of non white peoples  46  It has also become an issue for businesses  that do not always understand the differences that occur between cultures  as they address how to meet the needs of a workforce that is increasingly more diverse  In academic sociology  the strongest definitions of multiculturalism as a form of segregation mainly emerge from the USA 47   Here  multiculturalism is seen as requiring that the host society facilitate  whether actively  or passively through an absence of assimilatory pressure  the maintenance of minority language  history  and other aspects of minority culture  Mulberry Street  along which Manhattan s Little Italy is centered  Lower East Side  New York City  United States  circa 1900  In the United States  continuous mass immigration had been a feature of economy and society since the first half of the 19th century  48 The absorption of the stream of immigrants became  in itself  a prominent feature of America s national myth  The idea of the Melting pot is a metaphor that implies that all the immigrant cultures are mixed and amalgamated without state intervention  49  The Melting Pot implied that each individual immigrant  and each group of immigrants  assimilated into American society at their own pace which  as defined above  is not multiculturalism as this is opposed to assimilation and integration  50  An Americanized  and often stereotypical  version of the original nation s cuisine  and its holidays  survived  The Melting Pot tradition co exists with a belief in national unity  dating from the American founding fathers   Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people   a people descended from the same ancestors  speaking the same language  professing the same religion  attached to the same principles of government  very similar in their manners and customs    This country and this people seem to have been made for each other  and it appears as if it was the design of Providence  that an inheritance so proper and convenient for a band of brethren  united to each other by the strongest ties  should never be split into a number of unsocial  jealous  and alien sovereignties   51  As a philosophy  multiculturalism began as part of the pragmatism movement at the end of the nineteenth century in Europe and the United States  then as political and cultural pluralism at the turn of the twentieth  52  It was partly in response to a new wave of European imperialism in sub Saharan Africa and the massive immigration of Southern and Eastern Europeans to the United States and Latin America  Philosophers  psychologists and historians and early sociologists such as Charles Sanders Peirce  William James  George Santayana  Horace Kallen  John Dewey  W  E  B  Du Bois and Alain Locke developed concepts of cultural pluralism  from which emerged what we understand today as multiculturalism  In Pluralistic Universe  1909   William James espoused the idea of a  plural society   James saw pluralism as  crucial to the formation of philosophical and social humanism to help build a better  more egalitarian society  53  The educational approach to multiculturalism has since spread to the grade school system  as school systems try to rework their curricula to introduce students to diversity earlier often on the grounds that it is important for minority students to see themselves represented in the classroom  54  In 2009 and 2010  controversy erupted in Texas as the state s curriculum committee made several changes to the state s requirements  often at the expense of minorities  They chose to juxtapose Abraham Lincoln s inaugural address with that of Confederate president Jefferson Davis  55  they debated removing Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and labor leader C sar Ch vez 56  and rejected calls to include more Hispanic figures  in spite of the high Hispanic population in the state  57   edit  United Kingdom Modest multicultural policies 58  were adopted by local administrations from the 1970s and 1980s onwards  in particular by the Labour government of Tony Blair and Harold Wilson  59  Most of the immigrants of the last decades came from Republic of Ireland  the Indian subcontinent or the Caribbean  i e  from former British colonies  60  In 2004 the number of people who became British citizens rose to a record 140 795   a rise of 12  on the previous year  This number had risen dramatically since 2000  61  The overwhelming majority of new citizens were born in Africa  32   and Asia  40    the largest three groups being people from Pakistan  India and Somalia  62  In 2011 Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader David Cameron said in a speech that  state multiculturalism has failed   63   edit  Continental Europe Ethno linguistic map of Austria Hungary  1910  Ethnic nationalism became the paramount issue as Italians  Slavs and Hungarians resisted rule by the German dominated Habsburg state  Ethno linguistic map of the Second Polish Republic  1937  The Polish Ukrainian animosity grew into ethnic massacres of 1943 44 in which up to 100 000 Poles died  64  Historically  Europe has always been a mixture of Latin  Slavic  Germanic  Uralic  Celtic  Hellenic  Illyrian  Thracian and other cultures influenced by the importation of Hebraic  Christian  Muslim and other belief systems  although the continent was supposedly unified by the super position of Imperial Roman Christianity  it is accepted that geographic and cultural differences continued from antiquity into the modern age  65  In the 19th century  the ideology of nationalism transformed the way Europeans thought about the state  65  Existing states were broken up and new ones created  the new nation states were founded on the principle that each nation is entitled to its own sovereignty and to engender  protect  and preserve its own unique culture and history  Unity  under this ideology  is seen as an essential feature of the nation and the nation state unity of descent  unity of culture  unity of language  and often unity of religion  The nation state constitutes a culturally homogeneous society  although some national movements recognized regional differences  Where cultural unity was insufficient  it was encouraged and enforced by the state  66  The 19th century nation states developed an array of policies the most important was compulsory primary education in the national language  66  The language itself was often standardized by a linguistic academy  and regional languages were ignored or suppressed  Some nation states pursued violent policies of cultural assimilation and even ethnic cleansing  66  Some European Union countries have introduced policies for  social cohesion    integration   and  sometimes   assimilation   The policies include  compulsory courses and or tests on national history  on the constitution and the legal system  e g   the computer based test for individuals seeking naturalization in the UK named Life in the United Kingdom test  introduction of an official national history  such as the national canon defined for the Netherlands by the van Oostrom Commission  67  and promotion of that history  e g   by exhibitions about national heroes  tests designed to elicit  unacceptable  values  In Baden W rttemberg immigrants are asked what they would do if their son says he is a homosexual   The desired answer is that they would accept it   68  prohibitions on Islamic dress   especially the niqab  often misnamed as burqa   69  Other countries have instituted policies which encourage cultural separation  The concept of  Cultural exception  proposed by France in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  GATT  negotiations in 1993 was an example of a measure aimed at protecting local cultures  70   edit  Bulgaria During its thousand years of history Bulgaria has hosted many religions  ethnic groups and nations  The capital Sofia is the only European city that has peacefully functioning within less than 100 meters 71  72  four holy temples of the major religions   Eastern Orthodox St Nedelya Church  Islam   Banya Bashi Mosque  Roman Catholicism   Cathedral of St Joseph  Sofia and Orthodox Judaism   Sofia Synagogue  the third largest synagogue in Europe  St Nedelya Church in Sofia This specifically unique arrangement has been called by historians a  multicultural cliche   73  It has also become known as  The Triangle of Religious Tolerance  74  and has innitiated the construction of a 100 square meters scale model of the site that is to become a symbol of the capital  75  76  77  Furthermore unlike some other Nazi Germany allies or German occupied countries excluding Denmark  Bulgaria managed to save its entire 48 000 strong Jewish population during World War II from deportation to concentration camps  78  79  According to Dr  Marinova  Christidi the main reason for the heroic efforts of Bulgarian people to save the Bulgarian Jews during WWII is Bulgaria s history of  co existed for centuries with other religions    giving it a unique multi cultural and multi ethnic history  80  Bulgaria has become a Balkan region s example of multiculturalism   not only in religious but also in artistic 81  and ethnic means 82  83    its largest ethnic minorities   turks and roma enjoy wide political representation  Back in the end of 1984 an underground organization called  National Liberation Movement of the Turks in Bulgaria  was formed in Bulgaria which headed the Turkish community s opposition movement  On January 4  1990 the activists of the movement registered an organization with the legal name  Movement for Rights and Freedom   MRF   in Bulgarian                               in Turkish  Hak ve  zg rl kler Hareketi  in the Bulgarian city of Varna   edit  Netherlands Main article  Multiculturalism in the Netherlands Multiculturalism in the Netherlands began with a major increases in immigration during the 1950s and 1960s  84  As a consequence  an official national policy of multiculturalism was adopted in the early 1980s  84  This policy subsequently gave way to more assimilationist policies in the 1990s  84  Following the murders of Pim Fortuyn  in 2002  and Theo van Gogh  in 2004  the political debate on the role of multiculturalism in the Netherlands reached new heights  85  Lord Sacks  Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth  distinguishes between tolerance and multiculturalism  and says that the Netherlands is a tolerant  rather than multicultural  society  86  The right wing cabinet recently said the Netherlands is going to take distance of Multicultural ideas about a multicultural society   Dutch culture  norms and values must be dominant  Minister Donner said  87   edit  Germany In October 2010  Angela Merkel told a meeting of younger members of her conservative Christian Democratic Union  CDU  party at Potsdam  near Berlin  that attempts to build a multicultural society in Germany had  utterly failed   88  stating   The concept that we are now living side by side and are happy about it does not work    88  89  She continued to say that immigrants should integrate and adopt Germany s culture and values  This has added to a growing debate within Germany 90  on the levels of immigration  its effect on Germany and the degree to which Muslim immigrants have integrated into German society   edit  Contemporary Eastern societies Further

most diverse country in the world  As per the 1961 Census of India  the country is home to 1652 mother tongues  91  The culture of India has been shaped by its long history  unique geography and diverse demography  India s languages  religions  dance  music  architecture and customs differ from place to place within the country  but nevertheless possess a commonality  The culture of India is an amalgamation of these diverse sub cultures spread all over the Indian subcontinent and traditions that are several millennia old  92  The Indian caste system describes the social stratification and social restrictions in the Indian subcontinent  in which social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups  often termed as j tis or castes  93  The term multiculturalism is not much used in India  Within Indian culture  the term diversity is more commonly used  Religiously  the Hindus form the majority  followed by the Muslims  The actual statistics are  Hindu  80 5    Muslim  13 4   including both Shia and Sunni   Christian  2 3    Sikh  2 1    Buddhist  Bah     Jain  Jew and Parsi populations  94  Linguistically  the two main language families in India are Indo Aryan  a branch of Indo European  and Dravidian  India officially follows a three language policy  Hindi  spoken just like Urdu  is the federal official language  English has the federal status of associate subsidiary official language and each state has its own state official language  in the Hindi sprachraum  this reduces to bilingualism   The Republic of India s state boundaries are largely drawn based on linguistic groups  this decision led to the preservation and continuation of local ethno linguistic sub cultures  except for the Hindi sprachraum which is itself divided into many states  Thus  most states differ from one another in language  culture  cuisine  clothing  literary style  architecture  music and festivities  See Culture of India for more information  Occasionally  however  India has encountered religiously motivated violence  95  such as the Moplah Riots  the Bombay riots  the 1984 anti Sikh riots and 2002 Gujarat riots   edit  Indonesia There are more than 700 living languages spoken in Indonesia 96  and although predominantly Muslim the country also has large Christian and Hindu populations  Indonesia s national motto   Bhinneka tunggal ika    Unity in Diversity  lit   many  yet one    articulates the diversity that shapes the country  Due to migration within Indonesia  as part of government transmigration programs or otherwise   there are significant populations of ethnic groups who reside outside of their traditional regions  Soon after the fourth Indonesian President  Abdurrahman Wahid came into power in 1999  he quickly abolished some of the discriminatory laws in efforts to improve race relationships  Chinese Indonesians are now in the era of rediscovery  Many younger generations  who cannot speak Mandarin due to the ban decades earlier  choose to learn Mandarin  as many learning centers open throughout the country  The Ambon  Maluku was the site of some of the worst violence between Christian and Muslim groups that gripped the Maluku Islands between 1999 and 2002  97   edit  Japan Japanese society  with its ideology of homogeneity  has traditionally rejected any need to recognize ethnic differences in Japan  even as such claims have been rejected by such ethnic minorities as the Ainu and Ryukyuan people  98  Japanese Minister Taro Aso has called Japan a  one race  nation  99  However  there are  International Society  NPOs funded by local governments throughout Japan  100   edit  Malaysia Main article  Ketuanan Melayu Malaysia is a multiethnic country  with Malays making up the majority  close to 52  of the population  About 24 6  of the population are Malaysians of Chinese descent  Malaysians of Indian descent comprise about 7  of the population  The remaining 10  comprises  Native East Malaysians  namely Bajau  Bidayuh  Dusun  Iban  Kadazan  Melanau  Orang Ulu  Sarawakian Malays  etc  Other native tribes of Peninsular Malaysia  such as the Orang Asli and Siamese people  and Non native tribes of Peninsular Malaysia such as the Chettiars  the Peranakan and the Portuguese  The Malaysian New Economic Policy or NEP serves as a form of affirmative action  see Bumiputera   101  It promotes structural changes in various aspects of life from education to economic to social integration  Established after the May 13 racial riots of 1969  it sought to address the significant imbalance in the economic sphere where the minority Chinese population had substantial control over commercial activity in the country  The Malay Peninsula has a long history of international trade contacts  influencing its ethnic and religious composition  Predominantly Malays before the 18th century  the ethnic composition changed dramatically when the British introduced new industries  and imported Chinese and Indian labor  Several regions in the then British Malaya such as Penang  Malacca and Singapore became Chinese dominated  Co existence between the three ethnicities  and other minor groups  was largely peaceful  despite the fact the immigration affected the demographic and cultural position of the Malays  Preceding independence of the Federation of Malaya  a social contract was negotiated as the basis of a new society  The contract as reflected in the 1957 Malayan Constitution and the 1963 Malaysian Constitution states that the immigrant groups are granted citizenship  and Malays  special rights are guaranteed  This is often referred to the Bumiputra policy  These pluralist policies have come under pressure from racialist Malay parties  who oppose perceived subversion of Malay rights  The issue is sometimes related to the controversial status of religious freedom in Malaysia   edit  Mauritius Multiculturalism has been a characteristic feature of the island of Mauritius  102  Mauritian society includes people from many different ethnic and religious groups  Hindu  Muslim and Sikh Indo Mauritians  Mauritian Creoles  of African and Malagasy descent   Buddhist and Roman Catholic Sino Mauritians and Franco Mauritians  descendants of the original French colonists   103   edit  Philippines The Philippines is the 8th most multiethnic nation in the world  104  It has 10 distinct major indigenous ethnic groups mainly the Bicolano  Ibanag  Ilocano  Ivatan  Kapampangan  Moro  Pangasinense  Sambal  Tagalog and Visayan  The Philippines also has several aboriginal races such as the Badjao  Igorot  Lumad  Mangyan and Negritos  The country also has considerable communities of American  Arabic  Chinese  Indian  and Hispanic descent  and other ethnicities from other countries  The Philippine government has various programs supporting and preserving the nation s ethnic diversity  105   edit  Singapore Besides English  Singapore recognizes three other languages  namely  Mandarin Chinese  Tamil and Malay as its official languages  with Malay being the national language  Besides being a multilingual country  Singapore also acknowledges festivals celebrated by these three ethnic communities  During the British colonial rule  there are areas which are enclaves containing a large population of certain ethnic groups exist in areas such as Chinatown  Geylang and Little India in Singapore  Presently  2010   remnants of the colonial ethnic concentration still exists but housing in Singapore is governed by the Ethnic Integration Policy  106  The current Indian Others ethnic limits are 10  and 13   the limits for Malays are 22  and 25   the limits for Chinese are 84  and 87  for the maximum ethnic limits for a neighborhood and a block respectively   edit  South Korea South Korea is among the world s most ethnically homogeneous nations  107  Those who do not share such features are often rejected by the Korean society or face discrimination  108  However  the word  multiculturalism  is increasingly heard in South Korea  In 2007  Han Geon Soo  Professor of Cultural Anthropology at Kangwon National University  published an article entitled  Multicultural Korea  Celebration or Challenge of Multiethnic Shift in Contemporary Korea    noting   As the increase of foreign migrants in Korea transforms a single ethnic homogenous Korean society into multiethnic and multicultural one  Korean government and the civil society pay close attention to multiculturalism as an alternative value to their policy and social movement   He argued  however  that  the current discourses and concerns on multiculturalism in Korea  lacked  the constructive and analytical concepts for transforming a society   109  The same year  Stephen Castles of the International Migration Institute argued   Korea no longer has to decide whether it wants to become a multicultural society  It made that decision years ago   perhaps unconsciously   when it decided to be a full participant in the emerging global economy  It confirmed that decision when it decided to actively recruit foreign migrants to meet the economic and demographic needs of a fast growing society  Korea is faced by a different decision today  what type of multicultural society does it want to be   110  The Korea Times suggested in 2009 that South Korea was likely to become a multicultural society  111  In 2010  JoongAng Daily reported   Media in Korea is abuzz with the new era of multiculturalism  With more than one million foreigners in Korea  2 percent of the population comes from other cultures   It added   If you stay too long  Koreans become uncomfortable with you        Having a 2 percent foreign population unquestionably causes ripples  but having one million temporary foreign residents does not make Korea a multicultural society        In many ways  this homogeneity is one of Korea s greatest strengths  Shared values create harmony  Sacrifice for the nation is a given  Difficult and painful political and economic initiatives are endured without discussion or debate  It is easy to anticipate the needs and behavior of others  It is the cornerstone that has helped Korea survive adversity  But there is a downside  too        Koreans are immersed in their culture and are thus blind to its characteristics and quirks  Examples of group think are everywhere  Because Koreans share values and views  they support decisions even when they are obviously bad  Multiculturalism will introduce contrasting views and challenge existing assumptions  While it will undermine the homogeneity  it will enrich Koreans with a better understanding of themselves   112   edit  Support for multiculturalism Multiculturalism is seen by its supporters as a fairer system that allows people to truly express who they are within a society  that is more tolerant and that adapts better to social issues  113  They argue that culture is not one definable thing based on one race or religion  but rather the result of multiple factors that change as the world changes  Historically  support for modern multiculturalism stems from the changes in Western societies after World War II  in what Susanne Wessendorf calls the  human rights revolution   in which the horrors of institutionalized racism and ethnic cleansing became almost impossible to ignore in the wake of the Holocaust  with the collapse of the European colonial system  as colonized nations in Africa and Asia successfully fought for their independence and pointed out the racist underpinnings of the colonial system  and  in the United States in particular  with the rise of the Civil Rights Movement  which criticized ideals of assimilation that often led to prejudices against those who did not act according to Anglo American standards and which led to the development of academic ethnic studies programs as a way to counteract the neglect of contributions by racial minorities in classrooms  114  115  As this history shows  multiculturalism in Western countries was seen as a useful set of strategies to combat racism  to protect minority communities of all types  and to undo policies that had prevented minorities from having full access to the opportunities for freedom and equality promised by the liberalism that has been the hallmark of Western societies since the Age of Enlightenment  C  James Trotman argues that multiculturalism is valuable because it  uses several disciplines to highlight neglected aspects of our social history  particularly the histories of women and minorities     and  promotes respect for the dignity of the lives and voices of the forgotten  116  By closing gaps  by raising consciousness about the past  multiculturalism tries to restore a sense of wholeness in a postmodern era that fragments human life and thought   116  Tariq Modood argues that in the early years of the 21st Century  multiculturalism  is most timely and necessary  and       we need more not less   since it is  the form of integration  that  1  best fits the ideal of egalitarianism   2  has  the best chance of succeeding  in the  post 9 11  post 7 7  world  and  3  has remained  moderate  and  pragmatic   117  Bhikhu Parekh counters what he sees as the tendencies to equate multiculturalism with racial minorities  demanding special rights  and to see it as promoting a  thinly veiled racis m    Instead  he argues that multiculturalism is in fact  not about minorities  but  is about the proper terms of relationship between different cultural communities   which means that the standards by which the communities resolve their differences  e g    the principles of justice  must not come from only one of the cultures but must come  through an open and equal dialogue between them   118   edit  Opposition to multiculturalism Main article  Criticism of multiculturalism Critics of multiculturalism often debate whether the multicultural ideal of benignly co existing cultures that interrelate and influence one another  and yet remain distinct  is sustainable  paradoxical  or even desirable  119  120  121  It is argued that Nation states  who would previously have been synonymous with a distinctive cultural identity of their own  lose out to enforced multiculturalism and that this ultimately erodes the host nations  distinct culture  122  Harvard professor of political science Robert D  Putnam conducted a nearly decade long study how multiculturalism affects social trust  123  He surveyed 26 200 people in 40 American communities  finding that when the data were adjusted for class  income and other factors  the more racially diverse a community is  the greater the loss of trust  People in diverse communities  don t trust the local mayor  they don t trust the local paper  they don t trust other people and they don t trust institutions   writes Putnam  124  In the presence of such ethnic diversity  Putnam maintains that  W e hunker down  We act like turtles  The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined  And it s not just that we don t trust people who are not like us  In diverse communities  we don t trust people who do look like us  123  Ethologist Frank Salter writes  Relatively homogeneous societies invest more in public goods  indicating a higher level of public altruism  For example  the degree of ethnic homogeneity correlates with the government s share of gross domestic product as well as the average wealth of citizens  Case studies of the United States  Africa and South East Asia find that multi ethnic societies are less charitable and less able to cooperate to develop public infrastructure  Moscow beggars receive more gifts from fellow ethnics than from other ethnies  sic   A recent multi city study of municipal spending on public goods in the United States found that ethnically or racially diverse cities spend a smaller portion of their budgets and less per capita on public services than do the more homogenous cities  125  Dick Lamm  former three term Democratic governor of the US state of Colorado  wrote in his essay  I have a plan to destroy America    Diverse peoples worldwide are mostly engaged in hating each other   that is  when they are not killing each other  A diverse  peaceful  or stable society is against most historical precedent   126  In Aotearoa  New Zealand   which is officially bi cultural  multiculturalism has been seen as a threat to Maori  and possibly an attempt by Pakeha  whites  to water down the growing strength of Maori demands for self determination  http   alt sagepub com content 33 1 29 abstract  edit  See also Culture portal Sociology portal Discrimination portal Human rights portal Cross culturalism Cultural competence
