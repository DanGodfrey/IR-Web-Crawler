Marvel put the project in production as its first self financed film  Favreau signed on as director  aiming for a naturalistic feel  and he chose to shoot the film primarily in California  rejecting the East Coast setting of the comics to differentiate the film from numerous superhero films set in New York City esque environments  During filming  the actors were free to create their own dialogue

inherited from his father  Even though Stark is an inventive genius and wunderkind  he is also a playboy  One day  while his father s old partner  Obadiah Stane  Jeff Bridges   takes care of day to day operations  Stark flies to war torn Afghanistan with his friend and military liaison  Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes a k a   Rhodey   Terrence Howard   for a demonstration of Stark Industries  new weapon  the  Jericho  missile  However  Stark is critically wounded in an assault and finds himself the prisoner of an Afghan terrorist group known as the Ten Rings  An electromagnet built by fellow captive Dr  Yinsen  Shaun Toub  keeps the shrapnel in his chest from reaching his heart and killing him  The Ten Rings leader  Raza  Faran Tahir   offers Stark his freedom in exchange for building a Jericho missile for the group  but Tony and Yinsen agree Raza will not keep his word  During his three months of captivity  Stark and Yinsen secretly build a powerful electric generator called an arc reactor  which will power Stark s electromagnet  and then begin to build a suit of armor to escape  The Ten Rings attack the workshop when they discover what Stark is doing  and Yinsen fights back to buy Stark time as the suit powers up  The armored Stark battles his way out of the caves and finds the dying Yinsen  who tells him not to waste his life  Stark burns the terrorists  munitions and flies away to crash in the desert  destroying the suit  After being rescued by Rhodes  Stark returns home and announces that his company will no longer manufacture weapons  Stane advises Stark that this may ruin Stark Industries and his father s legacy  In his home workshop  Stark builds an improved version of his suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor for his chest  When Stark makes his first public appearance after his return  reporter Christine Everhart  Leslie Bibb  informs him that Stark Industries  weapons  including the Jericho  were recently delivered to the Ten Rings and are being used to attack Yinsen s home village  He also learns that Stane is trying to succeed him as head of the company  Enraged  Stark decides to intervene using his now finished suit  In a lengthy and elaborate scene  Stark dons his new armor and then flies to Afghanistan where he saves Yinsen s village and turns Raza s subordinate over to the villagers  While flying home  Stark is shot at by two F 22 Raptor fighter jets  He calls Rhodes on his cell phone and reveals his secret identity in an attempt to get the attack called off  Meanwhile  the Ten Rings find the pieces of Stark s prototype suit and meet with Obadiah  who has the group eliminated and has the company s engineers reverse engineer a new suit from the wreck  Seeking to find any other weapons delivered to the Ten Rings  Stark sends his assistant Virginia  Pepper  Potts  Gwyneth Paltrow  to hack into the company computer system from Obadiah s office  She discovers Obadiah has been supplying terrorists with Stark weaponry and hired the Ten Rings to kill Stark  but the group reneged on the deal upon discovering who the target was  Pepper  soon after  meets with agent Phil Coulson  Clark Gregg  of the  Strategic Homeland Intervention  Enforcement and Logistics Division   a counter terrorism agency  to inform him of Obadiah s activities  Stane s scientists cannot duplicate Stark s arc reactor  so Stane ambushes Stark in his home  using a sonic device to paralyze him and take his arc reactor  Left to die  Stark crawls to his lab and retrieves his original reactor  Potts and several S H I E L D  agents attempt to arrest Stane  but are attacked by him in his now functional suit  Stark races to the rescue and fights Stane  but is quickly overpowered without his new reactor to run his suit at full capacity  Stark lures him atop the Stark Industries building and instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor in the building  This unleashes a massive electrical surge that knocks Stane unconscious  causing him and his armor to fall into the exploding reactor  The next day  the press has dubbed Stark in his armor as  Iron Man   Agent Coulson gives him a cover story to explain the events of the night and Stane s death  At a press conference  Stark starts to tell the cover story given to him by S H I E L D   but then announces that he is Iron Man  In a post credits scene  S H I E L D  Director Nick Fury  Samuel L  Jackson  visits Stark at home  and  noting that Iron Man is not  the only superhero in the world   says he wants to discuss the  Avenger Initiative    edit  Cast Robert Downey Jr  as Anthony  Tony  Stark   Iron Man  An industrialist  genius inventor  and consummate playboy  he is CEO of Stark Industries  a chief weapons manufacturer for the U S  military  The son of a Manhattan Project engineer  Howard Stark  he is an engineering prodigy  having built a circuit board at four years old and an engine at six  as well as graduating from MIT summa cum laude at the age of 17  He takes charge of Stark Industries at the age of 21 from Stane  who had been in control of the company since Howard s death  Favreau had planned to cast a newcomer in the role  3  but ultimately chose Downey  a fan of the comic  4  because he felt the actor s past made him an appropriate choice for the part   The best and worst moments of Robert s life have been in the public eye   the director explained   He had to find an inner balance to overcome obstacles that went far beyond his career  That s Tony Stark  Robert brings a depth that goes beyond a comic book character who is having trouble in high school  or can t get the girl   4  Favreau also felt Downey could make Stark a  likable asshole   but also depict an authentic emotional journey once he won over the audience  5  Downey had an office next to Favreau during pre production  which allowed him greater involvement in the screenwriting process  6  He brought a deeper sense of humor to the film not present in previous drafts of the script  7  He explained  What I usually hate about these  superhero  movies  is  when suddenly the guy that you were digging turns into Dudley Do Right  and then you re supposed to buy into all his  Let s go do some good   That Eliot Ness in a cape type thing  What was really important to me was to not have him change so much that he s unrecognizable  When someone used to be a schmuck and they re not anymore  hopefully they still have a sense of humor  8  To prepare  Downey spent five days a week weight training and practiced martial arts to get into shape  4  which he said benefited him because  it s hard not to have a personality meltdown       after about several hours in that suit  I m calling up every therapeutic moment I can think of to just get through the day   9  Howard preparing for the role by riding an F 16 flight simulator Terrence Howard as Lt  Colonel James  Rhodey  Rhodes  A friend of Stark s  and the liaison between Stark Industries and the U S  Air Force in the department of acquisitions  Favreau cast Howard because he felt he could play War Machine in a sequel  10  Howard prepared for the role by visiting Nellis Air Force Base on March 16  2007  where he ate with the pilots and observed HH 60 Pave Hawk rescue helicopters and F 22 Raptors  11  While Rhodes is roguish in the comics after he met Stark  his earlier disciplinarian character forms a dynamic with Stark  and he is unsure whether or not Stark s actions are acceptable   Rhodey is completely disgusted with the way Tony has lived his life  but at a certain point he realizes that perhaps there is a different way   Howard said   Whose life is the right way  is it the strict military life  or the life of an independent   9  Howard and his father are Iron Man fans  partly because Rhodes was one of the few black superheroes when he was a child  12  He was a Downey fan since he saw him in Weird Science  and they competed physically on set   Robert and his competitive ass almost tore my shoulder trying to keep up with him  Because I m 40 or 50 pounds heavier than him  so I m in there lifting and I pushed up about 225 pounds  102 kg  and knocked it out 10 times  Robert wanted to go about 235  106 kg   and he did it  So I m going to push it up to about 245  111 kg   I took him out running and gave him some nice cramps  He couldn t walk after a couple of days   13  Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane  Stark s business second in command and eventual antagonist  Bridges read the comics as a boy and liked Favreau s modern  realistic approach  He shaved his head and grew a gray beard for the role  which was something he had wanted to do for some time  Bridges googled the Book of Obadiah  and he was surprised to learn retribution is a major theme in that particular book of the Bible  something which Stane represents  14  Many of Stane s scenes were cut out to focus more on Stark  but the writers felt Bridges s performance allowed the application of  less is more   15  Gwyneth Paltrow as Virginia  Pepper  Potts  Stark s personal assistant and budding love interest  Paltrow asked Marvel to send her any comics that they would consider relevant to her understanding of the character  who she considered to be very smart  levelheaded  and grounded  She said she liked  the fact that there s a sexuality that s not blatant   Favreau wanted Potts  and Stark s relationship to be reminiscent of a 1940s comedy  something which Paltrow considered to be fun in a sexy  yet innocent way  16  Shaun Toub as Dr  Yinsen  Stark s fellow captive  In the comics  Yinsen is a Chinese physicist  but in the film  he comes from an Afghan village called Gulmira  which is one of the aspects of the modernization of the Iron Man mythos for the movie  Faran Tahir as Raza  The leader of the Ten Rings  Tahir is a fan of the comics  14  and wanted to bring humanity to the henchman   I tried to find ways to show that although he may be the bad guy  there might be a moment or just a hint of vulnerability at times  where he hasn t made the right calculations or there s a certain amount of doubt  Jon was very receptive to that kind of layering   17  Paul Bettany voices JARVIS  Stark s personal Artificial Intelligence computer program  which assists him in the construction and programming of the Iron Man suit  The name of the character is a reference to the comic book character Edwin Jarvis  Stark s butler  In Peter David s novelization of the film  Jarvis is revealed as an acronym for  Just A Rather Very Intelligent System   18  Bettany did the part as a favor to Favreau  having worked with him on Wimbledon  and said he did not know what film he was recording the lines for during his two hour recording session  19  Leslie Bibb as Christine Everhart  A reporter for Vanity Fair  She is a minor character in the comics  where she works as a reporter for The Daily Bugle and has investigated Tony Stark  20  Clark Gregg appears throughout the film as Agent Coulson of S H I E L D   21  and appears as the same character in Iron Man 2 and Thor  Samuel L  Jackson appears as the agency s head  Nick Fury  following the credits  Jackson s face was used  with his permission  as the model for that of the version of Nick Fury in Marvel s Ultimate Marvel imprint  22  Other cameos include Iron Man co creator Stan Lee  whom Stark mistakes for Hugh Hefner at a party   23  and director Jon Favreau as Stark s bodyguard and chauffeur  Happy Hogan  7 Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave guitarist Tom Morello  who provides additional guitar music for the film  has a brief cameo as a terrorist guard  24 Jim Cramer  star of CNBC s Mad Money appeared as himself  commenting on the investment opportunities   Sell  Sell  Sell   of Stark Industries  25 Rapper Ghostface Killah cameoed in a scene where Stark briefly stays in Dubai while returning to Afghanistan  but it was cut from the theatrical release for pacing reasons  26   edit  Production  edit  Development In April 1990  Universal Studios bought the rights to develop Iron Man for the big screen  27 Stuart Gordon was to direct Universal s low budget film  9  By February 1996  20th Century Fox acquired the rights from Universal  28  In January 1997  actor Nicolas Cage expressed interest in being cast for the lead role  29  and in September 1998  actor Tom Cruise had expressed interest in producing as well as starring in the film debut of Iron Man  30 Jeff Vintar and Iron Man co creator Stan Lee co wrote a story which Vintar adapted into a screenplay  Jeffrey Caine  GoldenEye  rewrote Vintar s script  31  Director Quentin Tarantino was approached in October 1999 to write and direct Iron Man  32  With no deal made  Fox eventually sold the rights to New Line Cinema the following December  33  By July 2000  the film was being written for the studio 34  by Ted Elliott  Terry Rossio  31  and Tim McCanlies  35  McCanlies s script used the idea of a Nick Fury cameo to set up his own film  31  New Line entered talks with Joss Whedon  a fan of the character Iron Man  in June 2001 for the possibility of the director taking the helm  36  In December 2002  McCanlies had turned in a completed script  37   We worked with Michael Crichton s researchers to find a grounded realistic way to deal with the suit  The idea was he needed the suit to stay alive  He s the same guy we used with Spider Man 2 to come up with Doc Ock s inhibitor chips and what the arms are made of and how they work        Mandarin was an Indonesian terrorist who masqueraded as a rich playboy who Tony knew    Alfred Gough on his draft for Nick Cassavetes  and New Line s aborted version 38  In December 2004  the studio attached director Nick Cassavetes to the project for a target 2006 release  39  After two years of unsuccessful development  and the deal with Cassavetes falling through  New Line Cinema returned the film rights to Marvel  Screenplay drafts had been written by Alfred Gough  Miles Millar and David Hayter  but they were not retained  New Line s script pitted Iron Man against his father Howard Stark  who becomes War Machine  40  In November 2005  Marvel Studios worked to start development from scratch  41  and announced it as their first independent feature  as Iron Man was their only major character not depicted in live action  6  In April 2006  Jon Favreau was hired as the film s director  with Arthur Marcum and Matt Holloway writing the script  42  Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby worked separately  with Favreau compiling both team s scripts  43  and the script received a polish by John August  44  Comic book staff Mark Millar  Brian Michael Bendis  Joe Quesada  Tom Brevoort  Axel Alonso  and Ralph Macchio were also called upon by Favreau to give advice on the script  45  Favreau had wanted to work with Marvel producer Avi Arad on another film after the Daredevil adaptation  6  Favreau celebrated getting the job by going on a diet  and lost seventy pounds  9  The director found the opportunity to create a politically ambitious  ultimate spy movie  in Iron Man  citing inspiration from Tom Clancy  James Bond  and RoboCop  46  Favreau also described his approach as similar to an independent film    i f Robert Altman had directed Superman   6  and also cited Batman Begins as an inspiration  47  He wanted to make Iron Man a story of an adult man literally reinventing himself  and realizing the world is far more complex than he believes  48  Favreau changed the Vietnam War origin of the character to Afghanistan  as he did not want to do a period piece  10  Choosing a villain was difficult  because Favreau felt Iron Man s archnemesis  the Mandarin  would not feel realistic  especially after Mark Millar gave his opinion on the script  45  He felt only in a sequel  with an altered tone  would the fantasy of the Mandarin s rings be appropriate  49  The decision to push him into the background is comparable to Sauron in The Lord of the Rings  47  or Palpatine in Star Wars  49  Favreau also wanted Iron Man to face a giant enemy  The switch from Mandarin to Obadiah Stane was done after Bridges was cast  26  Stane was intended to become a villain in the sequel  45  The Crimson Dynamo was also a villain in early drafts in the script  7  Favreau felt it was important to include intentional inside references for fans of the comics  such as giving the two fighter jets that attack Iron Man the call signs of  Whiplash 1  and  Whiplash 2   a reference to the comic book villain Whiplash  and including Captain America s shield in Stark s workshop  50  The post closing credits sequence that introduces Samuel L  Jackson as Nick Fury was written by comics writer Brian Michael Bendis  51   edit  Filming Production was based in the former Hughes Company soundstages in Playa Vista  Los Angeles  California  52  Favreau rejected the East Coast setting of the comic books because many superhero films had already been set there  10 Howard Hughes was one of the inspirations for the comic book  and the filmmakers acknowledged the coincidence that they would film Iron Man creating the flying Mark III where the Hughes H 4 Hercules  Spruce Goose  was built  14  Filming began on March 12  2007  53  with the first few weeks spent on Stark s captivity in Afghanistan  54  The cave where Stark is imprisoned was a 150  to 200 yard  150 200 m  long set  which had movable forks in the caverns to allow greater freedom for the film s crew  10 Production designer J  Michael Riva saw footage of a Taliban fighter in Afghanistan  and saw the cold breath as he spoke  realizing remote caves are actually very cold  Riva placed an air conditioning system in the set  He also sought Downey s advice about makeshift objects in prison  such as a sock being used to make tea  14  Afterwards  Stark s capture was filmed at Lone Pine  and other exterior scenes in Afghanistan were filmed at Olancha Sand Dunes  where the crew endured two days of 40 to 60 mile an hour  60 to 100 km h  winds  14  Filming at Edwards Air Force Base began in mid April  55  and wrapped on May 2  56  Exterior shots of Stark s home were digitally composited on footage of Point Dume in Malibu  26  while the interior was built at Playa Vista  where Favreau and Riva aimed to make Stark s home look less futuristic and more  grease monkey   14  Filming concluded on June 25  2007 at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas  Nevada  57  Favreau  a newcomer to action films  remarked   I m shocked that I  was  on schedule  I thought that there were going to be many curveballs   He hired  people who are good at creating action   so  the human story  felt  like it belongs to the comic book genre   9  There was much improvisation in dialogue scenes  because the script was not completed when filming began  the filmmakers had focused on the story making sense and planning the action   Favreau acknowledged that improvisation would make the film feel more natural  Some scenes were shot with two cameras to capture lines said on the spot  Multiple takes were done  as Downey wanted to try something new each time  26  It was Downey s idea to have Stark hold a news conference on the floor  9  and he created the speech Stark makes when demonstrating the Jericho weapon  5  Brian Michael Bendis wrote three pages of dialogue for the Nick Fury cameo scene  with the filmmakers choosing the best lines for filming  45  The cameo was filmed with a skeleton crew in order to keep it a secret  but rumors appeared on the Internet only days later  Marvel Studios s Kevin Feige subsequently ordered the scene removed from all preview prints in order to maintain the surprise and keep fans guessing  58   edit  Effects A scale model of the  Iron Monger  suit Favreau wanted the film to be believable by showing the construction of the suit in its three stages  10 Stan Winston  a fan of the comic book  and his company built metal and rubber versions of the armors  They had previously worked on Favreau s Zathura  14  Favreau s main concern with the effects was whether the transition between the computer generated and practical costumes would be too obvious  59 Industrial Light  amp  Magic  ILM  was hired to create the bulk of the visual effects with additional work being completed by The Orphanage and The Embassy  Favreau trusted ILM after seeing Pirates of the Caribbean  At World s End and Transformers  14  The Mark I design was intended to look like it was built from spare parts  particularly  the back is less armored than the front  as Stark would use his resources to make a forward attack  It also foreshadows the design of Stane s armor  A single 90 pound  41 kg  version was built  causing concern when a stuntman fell over inside it  Both the stuntman and the suit were unscathed  The armor was also designed to only have its top half worn at times  14  The Embassy created a digital version of the Mark I  60  Stan Winston Studios built a 10 foot  3 0 m   800 pound  360 kg  animatronic version of the comic character  Iron Monger   Obadiah Stane   14  a name which Obadiah Stane calls Tony Stark and himself earlier in the film  but is never actually used for the suit itself  The animatronic required five operators for the arm  and was built on a gimbal to simulate walking  14  A scale model was used for the shots of it being built  26  The Mark II resembles an airplane prototype  with visible flaps  26  Iron Man comic book artist Adi Granov designed the Mark III with illustrator Phil Saunders  61  Granov s designs were the primary inspiration for the film s design  and he came on board the film after he recognized his work on Jon Favreau s MySpace page  47  Saunders streamlined Granov s concept art  making it stealthier and less cartoonish in its proportions  14  Sometimes  Downey would only wear the helmet  sleeves and chest of the costume over a motion capture suit  14  For shots of the Mark III flying  it was animated to look realistic by taking off slowly  and landing quickly  To generate shots of Iron Man and the F 22 Raptors battling  cameras were flown in the air to provide reference for physics  wind and frost on the lenses  62  For further study of the physics of flying  skydivers were filmed in a vertical wind tunnel  63  Phil Saunders created concept art for the War Machine armor and said that it was originally intended to be used in the film but was  cut from the script about halfway through pre production   Saunders said that the War Machine armor  was going to be called the Mark IV armor and would have been weaponized swap out parts that would be worn over the original Mark III armor   and that it  would have been worn by Tony Stark in the final battle sequence   64   edit  Music See also  Iron Man  soundtrack  Composer Ramin Djawadi is an Iron Man fan  and still has issues of the comic from the late 1970s  Through his older brother  Amir  he is also into heavy metal music since the early 1990s  While he normally composes after watching an assembly cut  Djawadi began work after seeing the teaser trailer  Favreau clearly envisioned a focus on  heavy  guitar in the score  and Djawadi composed the music on that instrument before arranging it for orchestra  The composer said Downey s performance inspired the several Iron Man themes  for his different moods   as well as Stark s playboy leitmotif  Djawadi s favorite of the Iron Man themes is the  kickass  because of its  rhythmic pattern that is a hook on its own  Very much like a machine   The other themes are  not so much character based  but rather plot based that carry you through the movie   65  Guitarist Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave  who has a brief cameo in the film as a guard  contributed additional guitar work to the movie s soundtrack   edit  Release Downey promoting the film in Mexico City The premiere was held at the Greater Union theater at George Street  Sydney  on April 14  2008  66  The film was released worldwide except for Japan between April 30 and May 7  2008  with Japan to receive the film in September 2008  67   edit  Marketing Marvel and Paramount modeled their marketing campaign for Iron Man on that of Transformers  68 Sega released a video game based on the film  which included other iterations of the character  69  A 30 second spot for the film aired during a Super Bowl XLII break  70  6 400 7 Eleven stores in the United States helped promote the film  and LG Group also made a deal with Paramount  68 Hasbro created figures of armors from the film  as well as Titanium Man  who appears in the video game  and the armor from the World War Hulk comics  71  Worldwide  Burger King and Audi promoted the film  Jon Favreau was set to direct a commercial for the fast food chain  as Michael Bay did for Transformers  68  In the film  Tony Stark drives an Audi R8  and also has an  American cheeseburger  from Burger King after his rescue from Afghanistan  as part of the studio s product placement deal with the respective companies  Three other vehicles  the Audi S6 sedan  Audi S5 sports coupe and the Audi Q7 SUV  also appear in the film  72  Audi created a tie in website  as General Motors did for Transformers  68 Oracle Corporation also promoted the film on its site  73  Estimates for the cost of marketing Iron Man ranged from US 50 to  75 million  74   edit  Critical reception Iron Man received critical acclaim  On May 1  2008  the film was identified as the  best reviewed film of the year so far  by Jen Yamato of review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes  with the site reporting at that time the film had received a rating of 95  based on 107 reviews and this rating has held its place as of January 2010  2  75  The film currently holds a score of 94  based on 235 reviews  76  with selected top critics giving it a score of 93  based on 39 reviews  77 Metacritic gave the film normalized average score of 79   based on 38 reviews  78  Among the major trade journals  Todd McCarthy in Variety called the film an  expansively entertaining special effects extravaganza  with  fresh energy and stylistic polish   79  while Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film while nonetheless finding  disappointment  in  a climatic  sic  battle between different Iron Man prototypes       how did Tony s nemesis learn how to use the suit   80  In one of the first major daily newspaper reviews  Frank Lovece of Newsday lauded the film s  emotional truth       pitch perfect casting and plausibly rendered super science  that made it  faithful to the source material while updating it   and recognizing what s made that material so enduring isn t just the high tech cool of a man in a metal suit  but the human condition that got him there   81 A  O  Scott of The New York Times called the film  an unusually good superhero picture  Or at least   since it certainly has its problems   a superhero movie that s good in unusual ways   82  Among the specialty press  Garth Franklin of Dark Horizons commended the  impressive sets and mechanics that combine smoothly with relatively seamless CG   and said   Robert Downey Jr   along with director Jon Favreau       help this rise above formula  The result is something that  whilst hardly original or groundbreaking  is nevertheless refreshing in its earnestness to avoid dark dramatic stylings in favor of an easy going  crowd pleasing action movie with a sprinkle of anti war and redemption themes   83 IGN s Todd Gilchrist recognized Downey as  the best thing  in a film that  functions on autopilot  providing requisite story developments and character details to fill in this default  origin story  while the actors successfully breathe life into their otherwise conventional roles   84  Among major metropolitan weeklies  David Edelstein of New York magazine called the film  a shapely piece of mythmaking       Favreau doesn t go in for stylized comic book frames  at least in the first half  He gets real with it   you d think you were watching a military thriller   85  while conversely  David Denby of The New Yorker put forth a negative review  claiming  a slightly depressed  going through the motions feel to the entire show       Gwyneth Paltrow  widening her eyes and palpitating  can t do much with an antique role as Stark s girl Friday  who loves him but can t say so  Terrence Howard  playing a military man who chases around after Stark  looks dispirited and taken for granted   86  Looking at the sociocultural aspects of the film  Cristobal Giraldez Catalan at Bright Lights Film Journal argues that   Iron Man is far more than playboy fantasy  it is American foreign policy realized without context    Iron Man  with narrative and directorial precision  once again provides the high fidelity misogyny and anti Muslim rhetoric Hollywood is known for   87  Roger Ebert and Richard Corliss named Iron Man as among their favorite films of 2008  88  89   edit  Box office In its opening weekend  Iron Man grossed  98 618 668 in 4 105 theaters in the United States and Canada  ranking number one at the box office  90
