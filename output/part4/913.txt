Republic of Madagascar  older name Malagasy Republic  Malagasy  Repoblikan i Madagasikara  republi k an mada as k ar     French  R publique de Madagascar  is an island country located in the Indian Ocean off the southeastern coast of Africa  The nation comprises the island of Madagascar  the fourth largest island in the world   as well as numerous smaller peripheral islands  Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana  Madagascar split from India around 88 million years ago  allowing plants and animals on the island to evolve in complete isolation  Consequently  Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot in which over 90  of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth  The island s diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by human settlement  Initial human settlement of Madagascar occurred from 350 BCE and 550 CE by Austronesian peoples arriving on outrigger canoes from Borneo who were later joined around 1000 CE by Bantu migrants crossing the Mozambique Channel  Other groups continued to settle on Madagascar over time  each one making lasting contributions to Malagasy cultural life  The Malagasy ethnic group is often divided into eighteen or more sub groups of which the largest are the Merina of the central highlands  Until the late 18th century  the island of Madagascar was ruled by a fragmented assortment of shifting socio political alliances  Beginning in the early 19th century  the majority of the island was united and ruled as the Kingdom of Madagascar by a series of Merina nobles  The monarchy collapsed when the island was conquered and absorbed into the French colonial empire in 1896  from which the island gained independence in 1960  The autonomous state of Madagascar has since undergone four major constitutional periods  termed Republics  Since 1992 the nation has officially been governed as a constitutional democracy from its capital at Antananarivo  However  in a popular uprising in 2009 the last elected president Marc Ravalomanana was made to resign and presidential power was transferred in March 2009 to Andry Rajoelina in a move widely viewed by the international community as a coup d  tat  In 2011  the population of Madagascar was estimated at around 21 9 million  90  of whom live on less than two dollars per day  Malagasy and French are both official languages of the state  The majority of the population adheres to traditional beliefs or Christianity  Ecotourism and agriculture  paired with greater investments in education  health and private enterprise  are key elements of Madagascar s development strategy  Under Ravalomanana these investments produced substantial economic growth but the benefits were not evenly spread throughout the population  producing tensions over the increasing cost of living and declining living standards among the poor and some segments of the middle class  Current and future generations in Madagascar are faced with the challenge of striking a balance between economic growth  equitable development and natural conservation  Contents 1 Etymology 2 Geography 2 1 Climate 2 2 Ecology 2 3 Environmental challenges 3 History 3 1 Early period 3 2

links Etymology In the Malagasy language  the island of Madagascar is called Madagasikara  mada as  k ar    and its people are referred to as Malagasy  7  However  the island s appellation  Madagascar  is not of local origin but rather was popularized in the Middle Ages by Europeans  8  The name Madageiscar was first recorded in the memoirs of 13th century Venetian explorer Marco Polo as a corrupted form of the name Mogadishu  the Somali port with which Polo had confused the island  On St  Laurence s Day in 1500  Portuguese explorer Diogo Dias landed on the island and christened it S o Louren o  but Polo s name was preferred and popularized on Renaissance maps  No single Malagasy language name predating Madagasikara appears to have been used by the local population to refer to the island  although some communities had their own name for part or all of the land they inhabited  9  Geography Main articles  Geography of Madagascar and Ecoregions of Madagascar At 592 800 square kilometres  228 900 sq mi   10  Madagascar is the world s 47th largest country 4  and the fourth largest island  10  The country lies mostly between latitudes 12 S and 26 S  and longitudes 43 E and 51 E  11  The prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana separated the Madagascar Antarctica India landmass from the Africa South America landmass around 135 million years ago  Madagascar later split from India about 88 million years ago  allowing plants and animals on the island to evolve in complete isolation  12  Along the length of the eastern coast runs a narrow and steep escarpment containing much of the island s remaining tropical rain forest  To the west of this ridge lies a plateau region in the center of the island ranging in altitude from 750 to 1 500 m  2 460 to 4 920 ft  above sea level  These central highlands  traditionally the homeland of the Merina people and the location of their historic capital at Antananarivo  are the most densely populated part of the island and are characterized by terraced  rice growing valleys lying between grassy  deforested hills  To the west of the highlands  the increasingly arid terrain gradually slopes down to the Mozambique Channel  13  Madagascar s highest peaks arise from three prominent highland massifs  Maromokotro 9 436 ft  2 876 m  on the Tsaratanana Massif is the island s highest point  followed by Boby Peak 2 658 m  8 720 ft  on the Andringitra Massif and Tsiafajavona 2 643 m  8 671 ft  on the Ankaratra Massif  To the east  the Canal des Pangalanes is a chain of man made and natural lakes connected by French built canals just inland from the east coast  running parallel to it for some 600 km  370 mi   The western and southern sides  which lie in the rain shadow of the central highlands  are home to tropical dry forests  thorn forests  and deserts and xeric shrublands  Presumably due to relatively lower population densities  Madagascar s dry deciduous rain forest has been better preserved than the eastern rain forests or the original woodlands of the central plateau  The western coast features many protected harbors  but silting is a major problem caused by sediment from the high levels of inland erosion carried by rivers crossing the broad western plains  14  The diversity of the Madagascan landscape  left to right   rice production in the central highlands  the desert like plains of Isalo National Park  the Avenue of the Baobabs near Morondava  the rain forests of the eastern coast and the spiny forests of the south  Climate The combination of southeastern trade winds and northwestern monsoon winds produce a hot rainy season  November April  with frequently destructive cyclones  and a relatively cooler dry season  May October   Rain clouds  originating over the Indian Ocean  discharge much of their moisture over the island s eastern coast where the heavy precipitation supports the area s rain forest ecosystem  The central highlands are both drier and cooler  while the west is drier still  with high aridity in the southwest and southern interior of the island where a semi desert climate prevails  13 Tropical cyclones annually cause damage to infrastructure and local economies as well as loss of life  15  In 2004 Cyclone Gafilo became the strongest cyclone ever recorded to hit Madagascar  The storm killed 172 people  left 214 260 homeless 16  and caused over  250 million in damage  Ecology Main articles  Wildlife of Madagascar  Fauna of Madagascar  and Agroecology in Madagascar The island s iconic traveler s palm  ravenala  features in the national emblem  As a result of the island s long isolation from neighboring continents  Madagascar is home to a vast array of plants and animals  many found nowhere else on Earth  17  18  Approximately 90  of all plant and animal species found in Madagascar are endemic  19  including the lemurs  a type of prosimian primate   the carnivorous fossa and many avian species  This distinctive ecology has led some ecologists to refer to Madagascar as the  eighth continent   20  and the island has been classified by Conservation International as a biodiversity hotspot  17  Over 80  of Madagascar s 14 883 plant species are found nowhere else in the world  including five plant families that are found only here  21  The plant family Didiereaceae  composed of four genera and 11 species  is limited to the spiny forests of southwestern Madagascar  13  Four fifths of the world s Pachypodium species are endemic to the island  22  Three fourths 23  of Madagascar s 860 21 orchid species are found here alone  as are six of the world s eight baobab species  24  The island is also home to around 170 palm species  three times as many as are found on mainland Africa  165 of these are endemic  23  Many native plant species are used as effective herbal remedies for a variety of afflictions  This includes the Madagascar periwinkle  from which the drugs vinblastine and vincristine have been derived to effectively treat Hodgkin s disease  leukemia and other cancers  25  The traveler s palm  endemic to the eastern rain forests  26  is highly iconic of Madagascar and is featured in the national emblem as well as the Air Madagascar logo  27  The ring tailed lemur is one of around 100 known species and subspecies of lemur found only in Madagascar  28  Like its flora  Madagascar s fauna is diverse and exhibits a high rate of endemism  Lemurs have been characterized as  Madagascar s flagship mammal species  by Conservation International  17  In the absence of monkeys and other competitors  these primates have adapted to a wide range of habitats and diversified into numerous species  As of 2008  there were officially 99 species and subspecies of lemur  39 of which have been described by zoologists between 2000 and 2008  29  They are almost all classified as rare  vulnerable  or endangered  At least 17 species of lemur have become extinct since man arrived on Madagascar  all of which were larger than the surviving lemur species  30  The biodiversity of fauna in Madagascar extends beyond prosimians to the wider animal population  A number of other mammals  including the cat like fossa  are endemic to Madagascar  Over 300 species of bird have been recorded on the island  of which over 60   including four families and 42 genera  are endemic  17  The few families and genera of reptile that have reached Madagascar have diversified into more than 260 species  with over 90  of these being endemic 31   including one endemic family   17  The island is home to two thirds of the world s chameleon species  31  including the smallest one known to date  32  and researchers have proposed that Madagascar may represent the origin of all chameleon species  Endemic fishes on Madagascar include two families  14 genera and over 100 species  primarily inhabiting the island s freshwater lakes and rivers  Although invertebrate species remain poorly studied on Madagascar relative to other wildlife  researchers have found high rates of endemism among the known species  All 651 species of terrestrial snail are endemic  as are a majority of the island s butterflies  scarab beetles  lacewings  spiders and dragonflies  17  Environmental challenges Main articles  Deforestation in Madagascar and Illegal logging in Madagascar Madagascar s varied fauna and flora are endangered by human activity  33  Since the arrival of humans around 2 350 years ago  Madagascar has lost more than 90  of its original forest  34  Key contributors to the loss of forest cover include the use of coffee as a cash crop  35  illegal logging  and slash and burn activities  locally called tavy  This traditional practice was imported to Madagascar by the earliest settlers and has strong cultural meaning  in addition to its practical value as an agricultural technique  36  Tavy  slash and burn  destruction of native forest habitat is widespread  left   causing massive erosion  center  and silting of rivers  right   Habitat destruction and hunting have threatened many of Madagascar s endemic species or driven them to extinction  This process is exemplified by the extinction of the elephant bird  an endemic giant ratite that was once the world s largest bird  This species  whose average height was over 3 metres  10 ft   has been extinct since at least the 17th century  most likely due to human hunting of adult birds and poaching of their large eggs for food  37  Numerous extinct giant lemur species also vanished with the arrival of human settlers to the island  and today most extant lemurs are listed as endangered or threatened species due to habitat destruction  Many species have become extinct over the course of the centuries  as a growing population put greater pressures on lemur habitats and  among some populations  increased the rate of lemur hunting for food  38  Under President Marc Ravalomanana  a vigorous effort was made to expand Madagascar s protected natural areas  At the 2003 IUCN World Parks Congress in Durban  Ravalomanana announced the Durban Vision  a bold initiative to more than triple the area under protection from approximately 17 000 km  to over 60 000 km   an increase from 3  to 10  of Madagascar s area   As of 2011  areas protected by the state included five Strict Nature Reserves  R serves Naturelles Int grales   21 Wildlife Reserves  R serves Sp ciales  and 21 National Parks  Parcs Nationaux   39  In 2007 six of the national parks were declared a joint World Heritage Site under the name Rainforests of the Atsinanana  These six parks are Marojejy  Masoala  Ranomafana  Zahamena  Andohahela and Andringitra  40  Local timber merchants are harvesting scarce species of rosewood trees from protected rainforests such as Marojejy National Park and exporting the wood to China for the production of luxury furniture and musical instruments  41  To raise public awareness of Madagascar s environmental challenges  the Wildlife Conservation Society opened an exhibit entitled  Madagascar   in June 2008 at the Bronx Zoo in New York  42  History Main article  History of Madagascar Early period Malagasy ancestry reflects a blend of Southeast Asian and East African roots Most archaeologists estimate that the earliest settlers arrived in outrigger canoes from southern Borneo in successive waves throughout the period between 350 BCE and 550 CE  making Madagascar one of the last major landmasses on Earth to be settled by humans  43  Upon arrival  early settlers practiced slash and burn agriculture to clear the coastal rainforests for cultivation  The first settlers encountered Madagascar s abundance of megafauna  including giant lemurs  elephant birds  giant fossa and the Malagasy hippopotamus  which have since become extinct due to hunting and habitat destruction  44  By 600 CE groups of these early settlers had begun clearing the forests of the central highlands  45  Arabs first reached the island between the seventh and ninth centuries  46  and a wave of Bantu speaking East African migrants arrived around 1000 CE and introduced zebu which were kept in large herds  36  Irrigated rice paddies emerged in the central highland Betsileo Kingdom by 1600 and were extended with terraced paddies throughout the neighboring Kingdom of Imerina a century later  45  The rising intensity of land cultivation and the ever increasing demand for zebu pasturage in the central highlands had largely transformed the central highlands from a forest ecosystem to grassland by the 17th century  36  The oral histories of the Merina people  who may have arrived in the central highlands between 400 and 1000 years ago  describe encountering an established population they called the Vazimba  Probably the descendants of an earlier and less technologically advanced Austronesian settlement wave  the Vazimba were expelled from the highlands by Merina kings Andriamanelo  Ralambo and Andrianjaka in the 16th and early 17th centuries  47  Today the spirits of the Vazimba are revered as tompontany  ancestral masters of the land  by many traditional Malagasy communities  48  Pirate cemetery at  le Sainte Marie Madagascar was an important transoceanic trading hub connecting ports of the Indian Ocean in the early centuries following human settlement  The written history of Madagascar began with the Arabs  who established trading posts along the northwest coast by at least the 10th century and introduced Islam  the Arabic script  used to transcribe the Malagasy language in a form of writing known as sorabe   Arab astrology and other cultural elements  15  European contact began in 1500  when the Portuguese sea captain Diogo Dias sighted the island  10  The French established trading posts along the east coast in the late 17th century  From about 1774 to 1824  Madagascar gained prominence among pirates and European traders  particularly those involved in the trans Atlantic slave trade  The small island of Nosy Boroha off the northeastern coast of Madagascar has been proposed by some historians as the site of the legendary pirate utopia of Libertalia  49  Many European sailors were shipwrecked on the coasts of the island  among them Robert Drury  whose journal is one of the few written depictions of life in southern Madagascar during the 18th century  50  The wealth generated by maritime trade spurred the rise of organized kingdoms on the island  some of which had grown quite powerful by the 17th century  51  Among these were the Betsimisaraka alliance of the eastern coast and the Sakalava chiefdoms of Menabe and Boina on the west coast  The Kingdom of Imerina  located in the central highlands with its capital at the royal palace of Antananarivo  emerged at around the same time under the leadership of King Andriamanelo  52  Kingdom of Madagascar Main article  Merina Kingdom King Andrianampoinimerina  1787 1810  Upon its emergence in the early 17th century  the highland kingdom of Imerina was initially a minor power relative to the larger coastal kingdoms 52  and grew even weaker in the early 18th century when King Andriamasinavalona divided it among his four sons  Following a century of warring and famine  Imerina was reunited in 1793 by King Andrianampoinimerina  1787 1810   53  From his initial capital Ambohimanga  and later from the Rova of Antananarivo  this Merina king rapidly expanded his rule over neighboring principalities  with the intention of bringing the entire island under his control  54  an ambition largely achieved by his son and successor  King Radama I  1810 1828   Radama concluded a treaty in 1817 with the British governor of Mauritius to abolish the lucrative slave trade in return for British military and financial assistance  Artisan missionary envoys from the London Missionary Society began arriving in 1818 and included such key figures as James Cameron  David Jones and David Griffiths  who established schools  transcribed the Malagasy language using the Roman alphabet  translated the Bible  and introduced a variety of new technologies to the island  55  Radama s successor  Queen Ranavalona I  1828 1861   responded to increasing political and cultural encroachment on the part of Britain and France by issuing a royal edict prohibiting the practice of Christianity in Madagascar and pressuring most foreigners to leave the territory  Among those who continued to reside in Imerina were Jean Laborde  an entrepreneur who developed munitions and other industries on behalf of the monarchy  and Joseph Fran ois Lambert  with whom then Prince Radama II signed a controversial trade agreement termed the Lambert Charter  Succeeding his mother  Radama II  1861 1863  attempted to relax the queen s stringent policies  but was overthrown two years later by Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony  1852 1865  and an alliance of noble courtiers  who sought to end the absolute power of the monarch  15  Following the coup  the courtiers offered Radama s queen Rasoherina  1863 1868  the opportunity to rule  if she would accept a power sharing arrangement with the Prime Minister a new social contract that would be sealed by a political marriage between them  56  Queen Rasoherina accepted  first wedding Rainivoninahitriniony  then later deposing him and wedding his brother  Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony  1864 1895   who would go on to marry Queen Ranavalona II  1868 1883  and Queen Ranavalona III  1883 1897  in succession  57  Over the course of Rainilaiarivony s 31 year tenure as Prime Minister  numerous policies were adopted to modernize and consolidate the power of the central government  58  Schools were constructed throughout the island and attendance was made mandatory  Army organization was improved  and British consultants were employed to train and professionalize soldiers  59  Polygamy was outlawed and Christianity  declared the official religion of the court in 1869  was adopted alongside traditional beliefs among a growing portion of the populace  58  Legal codes were reformed on the basis of British Common Law and three European style courts were established in the capital city  59  In his joint role as Commander in Chief  Rainilaiarivony also successfully ensured the defense of Madagascar against several French colonial incursions  59  French colonization Primarily on the basis that the Lambert Charter had not been respected  France invaded Madagascar in 1883 in what became known as the first Franco Hova War  60  At the war s end  Madagascar ceded the northern port town of Antsiranana  Diego Suarez  to France and paid 560 000 francs to Lambert s heirs  61  In 1890  the British accepted the full formal imposition of a French protectorate on the island  but French authority was not acknowledged by the government of Madagascar  To force capitulation  the French bombarded and occupied the harbor of Toamasina on the east coast  and Mahajanga on the west coast  in December 1894 and January 1895 respectively  62  A French military flying column then marched toward Antananarivo  losing many men to malaria and other diseases  Reinforcements came from Algeria and Sub Saharan Africa  Upon reaching the city in September 1895  the column bombarded the royal palace with heavy artillery  causing heavy casualties and leading Queen Ranavalona III to surrender  63  France annexed Madagascar in 1896 and dissolved the 103 year old Merina monarchy  sending the royal family into exile on Reunion Island and in Algeria  64  Under colonial rule  plantations were established for the production of a variety of export crops  65 Slavery was abolished in 1896  but many of the 500 000 liberated slaves remained in their former masters  homes as servants  66  Wide paved boulevards and gathering places were constructed in the capital city of Antananarivo 67  and the Rova palace compound was turned into a museum  68  Additional schools were built  particularly in rural and coastal areas where the schools of the Merina had not reached  Education became mandatory between the ages of 6 to 13 and focused primarily on French language and practical skills  69  The Merina royal tradition of taxes paid in the form of labor was continued under the French and used to construct a railway and roads linking key coastal cities to Antananarivo  70  Malagasy troops fought for France in World War I  10  In the 1930s the island was identified by Nazi leadership as a potential site for the deportation of Europe s Jews  71  and during the Second World War was the site of a battle between the Vichy government and the British  72  The occupation of France during the Second World War tarnished the prestige of the colonial administration in Madagascar and galvanized the growing independence movement  leading to the Malagasy Uprising of 1947  73  This movement led the French to establish reformed institutions in 1956 under the Loi Cadre  Overseas Reform Act   and Madagascar moved peacefully towards independence  The Malagasy Republic was proclaimed on October 14  1958  as an autonomous state within the French Community  A period of provisional government ended with the adoption of a constitution in 1959 and full independence on June 26  1960  74  Independent state Philibert Tsiranana  first president of Madagascar  1960 1972  Since regaining independence  Madagascar has transitioned through four republics with corresponding revisions to its constitution  The First Republic  1960 1972   under the leadership of French appointed President Philibert Tsiranana  was characterized by a continuation of strong economic and political ties to France  15  Many high level technical positions were filled by French expatriates  and French teachers  textbooks and curricula continued to be used in schools around the country  Popular resentment over Tsiranana s tolerance for this  neo colonial  arrangement inspired a series of student protests that overturned his administration in 1972  Gabriel Ramanantsoa  a Major General in the army  was appointed interim President and Prime Minister that same year  but low public approval forced him to step down in 1975  Colonel Richard Ratsimandrava was appointed to succeed him but was assassinated six days into his tenure  General Gilles Andriamahazo ruled after him for four months before being replaced by another military appointee  Vice Admiral Didier Ratsiraka  who ushered in the socialist Marxist Second Republic that ran under his tenure from 1975 to 1993  This period saw a political alignment with the Eastern Bloc countries and a shift toward economic insularity  These policies  coupled with economic pressures stemming from the 1973 oil crisis  resulted in the rapid collapse of Madagascar s economy and a sharp decline in living standards  15  Ratsiraka s dwindling popularity in the late 1980s reached a critical point when presidential guards opened fire on unarmed protesters during a rally in 1991  Within two months  a transitional government had been established under the leadership of Albert Zafy  1993 1996   who went on to win the 1992 presidential elections and inaugurate the Third Republic  1992 2010   75  The new constitution established a multi party democracy and a separation of powers that placed significant control in the hands of the National Assembly  The new constitution also emphasized human rights  social and political freedoms  and free trade for economic development  15  Zafy s term  however  was marred by economic decline  allegations of corruption  and his introduction of legislation to give himself greater powers  He was consequently impeached in 1996  and an interim president  Norbert Ratsirahonana  was appointed for the three months prior to the next presidential election  Ratsiraka was then voted back into power on a platform of decentralization and economic reforms  but only gradual progress was made during his second tenure  which lasted from 1996 to 2001  76  The contested 2001 presidential elections in which then mayor of Antananarivo  Marc Ravalomanana  eventually emerged victorious  caused a seven month standoff in 2002 between supporters of Ravalomanana and Ratsiraka  The negative economic impact of the political crisis was gradually overcome by Ravalomanana s progressive economic and political policies  which encouraged investments in education and ecotourism  facilitated foreign direct investment  and cultivated trading partnerships both regionally and internationally  National GDP grew at an average rate of 7  per year under his administration  In the later half of his second term  Ravalomanana was criticised by domestic and international observers who accused him of increasing authoritarianism and corruption  76  Opposition leader and then mayor of Antananarivo  Andry Rajoelina  led a movement in early 2009 in which Ravalomanana was pushed from power in an unconstitutional process widely condemned as a coup d  tat  In March 2009  Rajoelina was declared by the Supreme Court as the President of the High Transitional Authority  an interim governing body responsible for moving the country toward presidential elections  In 2010  a new constitution was adopted by referendum  establishing a Fourth Republic  which sustained the democratic  multi party structure established in the previous constitution  By early 2012  a fixed date for presidential elections had not been set by the Rajoelina administration  75  Government Structure Main articles  Government of Madagascar and Antananarivo Antananarivo is the political and economic capital of Madagascar  Madagascar is a semi presidential representative democratic multi party republic  wherein the popularly elected president is the head of state and selects a prime minister  who recommends candidates to the president to form his cabinet of ministers  According to the constitution  executive power is exercised by the government while legislative power is vested in the ministerial cabinet  the Senate and the National Assembly  although in reality these two latter bodies have very little power or legislative role  The constitution establishes independent executive  legislative and judicial branches and mandates a popularly elected president limited to three five year terms  10  The last presidential election was held on December 3  2006 and resulted in the re election of Marc Ravalomanana  from whom executive power was unconstitutionally transferred to Andry Rajoelina in March 2009  There is currently no legitimately elected head of state in Madagascar  The public also elects the 127 members of the National Assembly to five year terms  The last National Assembly election was held on September 23  2007  All 33 members of the Senate serve six year terms  with 22 senators elected by local officials and 11 appointed by the president  After taking power  Rajoelina dissolved both the National Assembly and the Senate  leaving the nation without a constitutional legislative body  10  At the local level  the island s 22 provinces are administered by a governor and provincial council  Provinces are further sub divided into regions and communes  The judiciary is modeled on the French system  with a High Constitutional Court  High Court of Justice  Supreme Court  Court of Appeals  criminal tribunals  and tribunals of first instance  77  Antananarivo is the administrative capital and largest city of Madagascar  10  It is located in the highlands region  near the geographic center of the island  King Andrianjaka founded Antananarivo as the capital of his Imerina Kingdom around 1610 or 1625 upon the site of a captured Vazimba capital on the hilltop of Analamanga  47  As Merina dominance expanded over neighboring Malagasy peoples in the early 19th century to establish the Kingdom of Madagascar  Antananarivo became the center of administration for virtually the entire island  In 1896 the French colonizers of Madagascar adopted the Merina capital as their center of colonial administration  The city remained the capital of Madagascar after independence  in 1960  In 2011  the capital s population was estimated at 1 300 000 inhabitants  By comparison  the next largest cities are Antsirabe  500 000   Toamasina  450 000  and Mahajanga  400 000   10  Administrative divisions Main articles  Provinces of Madagascar and Regions of Madagascar Map of the regions and former provinces of Madagascar As part of an effort to decentralize administration  Madagascar s six administrative provinces  faritany mizakatena   established under the French colonial authority in 1946  78  were subdivided into 22 regions  faritra  in 2004  The regions became the highest subdivision level when the provinces were dissolved in accordance with the results of the 2007 referendum  10  The regions are further subdivided into 119 districts  1 579 communes  and 17 485 fokontany  79  Regions and former provinces 80  New regions Former provinces Population 2004 estimate Diana  1   Sava  2

in Madagascar has been marked by struggle for control  Since Madagascar gained independence from France in 1960  the island s political transitions have been marked by numerous popular protests  several disputed elections  an impeachment  two military coups and one assassination  The island s recurrent political crises are often prolonged  with detrimental effects on the local economy  international relations and Malagasy living standards  The eight month standoff between incumbent Ratsiraka and challenger Marc Ravalomanana  following the 2001 presidential elections  cost Madagascar millions of dollars in lost tourism and trade revenue as well as damage to infrastructure  such as bombed bridges and buildings damaged by arson  81 A series of protests led by Andry Rajoelina against Ravalomanana in early 2009 became violent  with more than 170 people killed  82  The installation of Rajoelina s transitional regime has  since March 2009  caused many bilateral donors and intergovernmental organizations to freeze aid and suspend regular diplomatic relations with Madagascar  causing economic development to stagnate and reversing many of the gains achieved under the previous administration  In addition  modern politics in Madagascar are colored by the history of Merina subjugation of coastal communities under their rule in the 19th century  The consequent tension between the highland and coastal populations has periodically flared up into isolated events of violence  83  Madagascar has historically been perceived as being on the margin of mainstream African affairs despite being a founding member of the Organisation of African Unity  which was established in 1963 and dissolved in 2002 to be replaced by the African Union  Madagascar was not permitted to attend the first African Union summit because of a dispute over the results of the election in December 2001  but rejoined the African Union in July 2003 after a 14 month hiatus triggered by the 2002 political crisis  However  Madagascar was suspended again by the African Union in March 2009 because of ongoing political crisis  84  Madagascar is a member of the International Criminal Court with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the United States military  10 Eleven countries have established embassies in Madagascar  including France  the United Kingdom  the United States  China and India  85  Human rights in Madagascar are protected under the constitution and the state is a signatory to numerous international agreements including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child  The extent to which such rights are reflected in practice remains open to debate  The 2010 Human Rights Report by the United States Department of State noted concerns over the suspension of democratic electoral processes following recent political unrest  86  Furthermore  reports of corruption  arbitrary arrest  widespread underage prostitution and child labor have demonstrated the prevalence of human rights issues in the country  87  Accusations of media censorship have arisen since 2009 due to the allegedly increasing restrictions on the coverage of opposition to the government  86  Security Main article  Military of Madagascar The rise of centralized kingdoms among the Sakalava  Merina and other ethnic groups produced the island s first standing armies by the 16th century  initially equipped with spears but later with muskets  cannon and other firearms  88  By the early 19th century  the Merina sovereigns of the Kingdom of Madagascar had brought much of the island under their control by mobilizing an army of trained and armed soldiers numbering as high as 30 000  89  French attacks on coastal towns in the later part of the century prompted then Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony to solicit British assistance to provide training to the queen s army  Despite the training and leadership provided by British military advisers  the Malagasy army was unable to withstand French weaponry and was obliged to surrender following an attack on the royal palace at Antananarivo  Madagascar was declared a colony of France in 1897  90  The political independence and sovereignty of the Malagasy armed forces  which comprises an army  navy and air force  was restored with independence from France in 1960  91  Since this time the Malagasy military has never engaged in armed conflict with another state or within its own borders  but has occasionally intervened to restore order during periods of political unrest  Under the socialist Second Republic  Admiral Didier Ratsiraka instated mandatory national armed or civil service for all young citizens regardless of gender  a policy that remained in effect from 1976 to 1991  92  93  The armed forces are under the direction of the Minister of the Interior  77  and have remained largely neutral during times of political crisis  as during the protracted standoff between incumbent Ratsiraka and challenger Marc Ravalomanana in the disputed 2001 presidential elections  when the military refused to intervene in favor of either candidate  This tradition was broken in 2009  when a segment of the army defected to the side of Andry Rajoelina  then mayor of Antananarivo  in support of his attempt to force President Ravalomanana from power  75  The Minister of the Interior is also responsible for the national police force  paramilitary force  gendarmerie  and the secret police  77  These bodies are stationed and administered at the local level  However  in 2009 fewer than one third of all communes had access to the services of the national police or gendarmerie  with most lacking local level headquarters for either corps  79  Economy Main articles  Economy of Madagascar and Tourism in Madagascar Embroidered table cloths are produced for sale to tourists at Nosy Komba  During Madagascar s First Republic  France heavily influenced Madagascar s economic planning and policy and served as its key trading partner  Key products were cultivated and distributed nationally through producers  and consumers  cooperatives  Government initiatives such as a rural development program and state farms were established to boost production of commodities such as rice  coffee  cattle  silk and palm oil  Popular dissatisfaction over these policies was a key factor in launching the socialist Marxist Second Republic  in which the formerly private bank and insurance industries were nationalized  state monopolies were established for such industries as textiles  cotton and power  and import export trade and shipping were brought under state control  Madagascar s economy quickly deteriorated as exports fell  industrial production dropped by 75 percent  inflation spiked and government debt increased  the rural population was soon reduced to living at subsistence levels  Over fifty percent of the nation s export revenues was spent on debt servicing  14  The IMF forced Madagascar s government to accept structural adjustment policies and liberalization of the economy when the state became bankrupt in 1982 and state controlled industries were gradually privatized over the course of the 1980s  The political crisis of 1991 led to the suspension of IMF and World Bank assistance  Conditions for the resumption of aid were not met under Zafy  who tried unsuccessfully to attract other forms of revenue for the State before aid was once again resumed under the interim government established upon Zafy s impeachment  The IMF agreed to write off half Madagascar s debt in 2004 under the Ravalomanana administration  Having met a set of stringent economic  governance and human rights criteria  Madagascar became the first country to benefit from the Millennium Challenge Account in 2005  10  Madagascar s GDP in 2009 was estimated at 8 6 billion USD  with a per capita GDP of  438  10  Approximately 69  of the population lives below the national poverty line threshold of one dollar per day  94  The agriculture sector constituted 29  of Malagasy GDP in 2011  while manufacturing formed 15  of GDP  Madagascar s sources of growth are tourism  agriculture and the extractive industries  95  Tourism focuses on the niche eco tourism market  capitalizing on Madagascar s unique biodiversity  unspoiled natural habitats  national parks and lemur species  96  An estimated 365 000 tourists visited Madagascar in 2008  but the sector has declined as a result of the political crisis with 180 000 tourists visiting in 2010  95  Natural resources and trade Madagascar s natural resources include a variety of unprocessed agricultural and mineral resources  Agriculture  including fishing and forestry  is a mainstay of the economy  Madagascar is the world s principal supplier of vanilla  cloves and ylang ylang  16  Other key agricultural resources include coffee  lychees and shrimp  Key mineral resources include various types of precious and semi precious stones  and Madagascar currently provides half of the world s supply of sapphires  which were discovered near Ilakaka in the late 1990s  97  The island also holds one of the world s largest reserves of ilmenite  titanium ore   as well as important reserves of chromite  coal  iron  cobalt  copper and nickel  14  Several major projects are underway in the mining  oil and gas sectors that are anticipated to give a significant boost to the Malagasy economy  These include such projects as coal mining at Sakoa and the extraction of nickel near Tamatave by Rio Tinto  as well as the development of the massive onshore heavy oil field at Tsimiroro and ultra heavy oil field at Bemolanga by Madagascar Oil  98  Exports formed 28  of GDP in 2009  10  Most of the country s export revenue is derived from the textiles industry  fish and shellfish  vanilla  cloves and other foodstuffs  95  The Madagascar U S  Business Council was formed in May 2003  as a collaboration between USAID and Malagasy artisan producers to support the export of local handicrafts to foreign markets  99  France is Madagascar s main trading partner  although the United States  Japan and Germany also have strong economic ties to the country  14  Imports of such items as foodstuffs  fuel  capital goods  vehicles  consumer goods and electronics consume an estimated 52  of GDP  The main sources of Madagascar s imports include France  China  Iran  Mauritius and Hong Kong  10  Infrastructure Main articles  Telecommunications in Madagascar and Transport in Madagascar Running water and electricity is supplied at the national level by a government service provider  Jirama  which is unable service the entire population  As of 2009  only seven percent of Madagascar s 22 districts had access to water provided by Jirama  while nine percent had access to its electricity services  Mobile telephone and internet access are widespread in urban areas but remain limited in rural parts of the island  Approximately one third of the districts are able to access the nations  several private telecommunications networks via mobile telephones or land lines  79  Two thirds of Madagascar s power is supplied by hydroelectric power plants with the remaining one third supplied by coal burning plants  14  In 2010  Madagascar had approximately 7 617 km  4 730 mi  of paved roads  854 km  530 mi  of railways and 432 km  270 mi  of navigable waterways  6  The majority of roads in Madagascar are unpaved  with many becoming impassable in the rainy season  Largely paved national routes connect the six largest regional towns to Antananarivo  with minor paved and unpaved routes providing access to other population centers in each district  There are several rail lines on the island  Antananarivo is connected to Toamasina  Ambatondrazaka  Antsirabe and Fianarantsoa by rail  and another rail line connects Fianarantsoa to Manakara  The most important port in Madagascar is located on the east coast at Toamasina  The next largest is located at Mahajanga but is significantly less used  The port at Antsiranana is considered one of the finest natural harbors in the world  although the volume of shipping through it is limited due to the town s remoteness and limited ground access to the capital  Air Madagascar services the island s many small regional airports  which offer the only practical means of access to many of the more remote regions of the island during rainy season road washouts  15  Health Child immunization is rising Medical centers  dispensaries and hospitals are found throughout the island  although they are concentrated in urban areas and particularly in Antananarivo  Access to medical care remains beyond the reach of many Malagasy  In addition to the high expense of medical care relative to the average Malagasy income  the prevalence of trained medical professionals remains extremely low  In 2010 Madagascar had an average of three hospital beds per 10 000 people and a total of 3 150 doctors  5 661 nurses  385 community health workers  175 pharmacists and 57 dentists for a population of 21 9 million  14 6  of government spending in 2008 was directed toward the health sector  Approximately 70  of spending on health was contributed by the government  while 30  originated with international donors and other private sources  100  The government provides at least one basic health center per commune  Private health centers are concentrated within urban areas and particularly those of the central highlands  79  Despite these barriers to access  health services have shown a trend toward improvement over the past twenty years  Child immunizations against such diseases as hepatitis C  diphtheria and measles increased an average of 60  in this period  indicating low but increasing availability of basic medical services and treatments  The Malagasy fertility rate in 2009 was 4 6 children per woman  declining from 6 3 in 1990  Rapid population growth remains a challenge  however  with teen pregnancy rates of 14 8  in 2011 much higher than the African average  100  In 2010 the maternal mortality rate was 440 per 100 000 births  compared to 373 1 in 2008 and 484 4 in 1990  indicating a decline in perinatal care following the 2009 coup  The infant mortality rate in 2011 was 41 per 1 000 births  10  with an under five mortality rate at 61 per 1 000 births  101  Schistosomiasis  malaria and sexually transmitted diseases are common in Madagascar  although infection rates of AIDS remain low relative to many countries in mainland Africa  at only 0 2  of the adult population  The malaria mortality rate is also among the lowest in Africa at 8 5 deaths per 100 000 people  in part due to the highest frequency use of insecticide treated nets in Africa  100  Adult life expectancy in 2009 was 63 years for men and 67 years for women  100  Education Main article  Education in Madagascar Education access and quality were prioritized under Ravalomanana Prior to the 19th century  all learning in Madagascar was informal and typically served to teach practical skills as well as social and cultural values  including respect for ancestors and elders  15  The first formal European style school was established in 1818 at Toamasina by members of the London Missionary Society  LMS   who were invited by King Radama I  1810 1828  to expand their schools throughout Imerina to teach basic literacy and numeracy to aristocratic children  The schools were closed by Ranavalona I in 1835 102  but reopened and expanded in the decades after her death  By the end of the 19th century Madagascar could boast the most developed and modern school system in pre colonial Sub Saharan Africa  Access to schooling was expanded in coastal areas during the colonial period  when French language and basic work skills were the focus of the curriculum  During the post colonial First Republic  a continued reliance on French nationals as teachers  and French as the language of instruction  created tension among those desiring a complete separation from the former colonial power  15  Consequently  under the socialist Second Republic  French instructors and other nationals were expelled  Malagasy was declared the language of instruction and a large cadre of young Malagasy were rapidly trained to teach at remote rural schools under the mandatory two year national service policy  103  This policy  known as malgachization  coincided with a severe economic downturn and a dramatic decline in the quality of education  people schooled during this period generally failed to master the French language or many other subjects  Struggling in the competitive local employment market  most remained mired in deepening poverty as they were obliged to turn to low paying jobs in the informal or black market  Excepting the brief presidency of Albert Zafy  from 1992 to 1996  Ratsiraka remained in power from 1975 to 2001 and failed to achieve significant improvements in the sector throughout this time  104  Education was prioritized under the Ravalomanana administration  2002 2009   and is currently free and compulsory from ages 6 to 13  105  The primary schooling cycle is five years  followed by four years at the lower secondary level and three years at the upper secondary level  15  During Ravalomanana s first term  thousands of new primary schools and additional classrooms were constructed  older buildings were renovated  and tens of thousands of new primary teachers were recruited and trained  Primary school fees were eliminated and kits containing basic school supplies were distributed to primary students  105  Government school construction initiatives have ensured at least one primary school per fokontany and one lower secondary school within each commune  At least one upper secondary school is located in each of the larger urban centers  79  The three branches of the national public university are located at Antananarivo  1961   Mahajanga  1977  and Fianarantsoa  1988   These are complemented by public teacher training colleges and several private universities and technical colleges  15  As a result of increased educational access  enrollment rates more than doubled between 1996 and 2006  Quality of education remains a challenge in Madagascar and student repetition and drop out rates are high  105  Education policy in Ravalomanana s second term focused on quality issues  including an increase in minimum education standards for the recruitment of primary teachers from a middle school leaving certificate  BEPC  to a high school leaving certificate  BAC   and a reformed teacher training program to support the transition from traditional didactic instruction to student centered teaching methods to boost student learning and participation in the classroom  106  Public expenditure on education was 13 4  of total government expenditure and 2 9  of GDP in 2008  Classroom overcrowding remains a challenge in Madagascar  where the 2008 pupil to teacher ratios were 47 1 at the primary level  107  Society Ethnic diversity and demographics Main articles  Ethnic groups of Madagascar and Demographics of Madagascar Malagasy ethnic groups The Malagasy ethnic group forms over 90  of Madagascar s population and is divided into eighteen ethnic sub groups  10  Recent DNA research revealed that the genetic makeup of the average Malagasy person constitutes an approximately equal blend of Austronesian and East African genes  108  109  although the genetics of some communities show a predominance of Austronesian or African origins or some Arab  Indian or European ancestry  110  Austronesian origins are most predominant among the Merina of the central highlands  83  who form the largest Malagasy ethnic sub group at approximately 26  of the population  while certain communities among the coastal peoples  collectively called c tiers  have relatively stronger African origins  The largest coastal ethnic sub groups are the Betsimisaraka  14 9   and the Tsimihety and Sakalava  6  each   15  Malagasy ethnic groups Regional concentration Antankarana  Sakalava  Tsimihety Antsiranana Province Sakalava  Vezo Mahajanga Province Betsimisaraka  Sihanaka  Bezanozano Toamasina Province Merina Antananarivo Province Betsileo  Antaifasy  Antambahoaka  Antaimoro  Antaisaka  Tanala Fianarantsoa Province Mahafaly  Antandroy  Antanosy people  Bara  Vezo Toliara Province Chinese  Indian and Comorian minorities are present in Madagascar  as well as a small European  primarily French  expatriate community  Emigration in the late 20th century has reduced these minority populations  occasionally in abrupt waves  such as the exodus of Comorans in 1976  following anti Comoran riots in Mahajanga  15  By comparison  there has been no significant emigration of Malagasy peoples  14  In the mid 1980s  the number of ethnic minorities in Madagascar was estimated at 25 000 Comorans  18 000 French  17 000 Indians  and 9 000 Chinese  15  The annual population growth rate in Madagascar was approximately 2 9  in 2009  10  The population grew from 2 2 million in 1900 15  to an estimated 21 9 million in 2011  4  Approximately 42 5  of the population is younger than 15 years of age  while 54 5  are between the ages of 15 and 64  Those aged 65 and older form three percent of the total population  95  Only two general censuses  1975 and 1993  have been carried out after independence  The most densely populated regions of the island are the eastern highlands and the eastern coast  contrasting most dramatically with the sparsely populated western plains  15  Language Main articles  Malagasy language and Languages of Madagascar The Malagasy language is of Malayo Polynesian origin and is generally spoken throughout the island  The numerous dialects of Malagasy  which are generally mutually intelligible  111  can be clustered under one of two sub groups  eastern Malagasy  spoken along the eastern forests and highlands  including the Merina dialect of Antananarivo  and western Malagasy  spoken across the western coastal plains  French became the official language  during the colonial period when Madagascar came under the authority of France  In the first national Constitution of 1958  Malagasy and French were named the official languages of the Malagasy Republic  Madagascar is a francophone country  and French is spoken among the educated population  15  No official languages were recorded in the Constitution of 1992  although Malagasy was identified as the national language  Nonetheless  many sources still claimed that Malagasy and French were official languages  eventually leading a citizen to initiate a legal case against the state in April 2000  on the grounds that the publication of official documents only in the French language was unconstitutional  The High Constitutional Court observed in its decision that  in the absence of a language law  French still had the character of an official language  112  In the Constitution of 2007  Malagasy remained the national language while official languages were reintroduced  Malagasy  French  and English  113  English was removed as an official language from the constitution approved by voters in the November referendum 2010  1  The outcome of the referendum  and its consequences for official and national language policy  are not recognized by the political opposition or by the international community  who cite lack of transparency and inclusiveness in the organization of the election by the High Transitional Authority  75  Religion Main article  Religion in Madagascar Famadihana reburial ceremony Approximately two fifths of the country s population practice traditional religion  10  which tends to emphasize links between the living and the razana  ancestors   The veneration of ancestors has led to the widespread tradition of tomb building  as well as the highlands practice of the famadihana  whereby a deceased family member s remains may be exhumed to be periodically re wrapped in fresh silk shrouds before being replaced in the tomb  The famadihana is an occasion to celebrate the beloved ancestor s memory  reunite with family and community  and enjoy a festive atmosphere  Residents of surrounding villages are often invited to attend the party  where food and rum are often served and a hiragasy troupe or other musical entertainment is typically present  114  Consideration for ancestors is also demonstrated through respect for fady  taboos that are respected during and after the lifetime of the person who establishes them  It is widely believed that by showing respect for ancestors in these ways  they may intervene on behalf of the living  Conversely  misfortunes are often attributed to ancestors whose memory or wishes have been neglected  The sacrifice of zebu is a traditional method used to appease or honor the ancestors  In addition  the Malagasy believe in a creator god  called Zanahary or Andriamanitra  115  Almost half the Malagasy are Christian  with about 20 percent practicing Roman Catholicism and over one fourth of the population adhering to Protestantism  10  In 1818 the London Missionary Society sent the first Christian missionaries to the island  where they built churches  translated the Bible into the Malagasy language and began to gain converts  Beginning in 1835 Queen Ranavalona I persecuted these converts as part of an attempt to halt European cultural and political influence on the island  In 1869 a successor  Queen Ranavalona II  converted the court to Christianity and encouraged Christian missionary activity  burning the sampy  royal idols  in a symbolic break with traditional beliefs  116  Today  many Christians integrate their religious beliefs with traditional ones relating to honoring the ancestors  For instance  they may bless their dead at church before proceeding with traditional burial rites or invite a Christian minister to consecrate a famadihana reburial  114  Many of the Christian churches are influential in politics  The best example of this is the Malagasy Council of Churches comprising the four oldest and most prominent Christian denominations  Roman Catholic  Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar  Lutheran  and Anglican   117  Eastern religions are also present on the island  Islam was first brought to the island in the Middle Ages by Arab and Somali Muslim traders  who established several Islamic schools along the eastern coast  While the use of Arabic script and loan words and the adoption of Islamic astrology would spread across the island  the Islamic religion failed to take hold in all but a handful of southeastern coastal communities  Today  Muslims constitute 7  of the population of Madagascar and are largely concentrated in the northwestern provinces of Mahajanga and Antsiranana  Diego Suarez   Muslims are divided between those of Malagasy ethnicity  Indians  Pakistanis and Comorians  More recently  Hinduism was introduced to Madagascar through Gujarati people immigrating from the Saurashtra region of India in the late 19th century  Most Hindus in Madagascar speak Gujarati or Hindi  118  Culture Hiragasy dancer Each of the many ethnic sub groups in Madagascar adhere to their own set of beliefs  practices and ways of life that have historically contributed to their unique identities  However  there are a number of core cultural features that are common throughout the island  creating a strongly unified Malagasy cultural identity  In addition to a common language and shared traditional religious beliefs around a creator god and veneration of the ancestors  the traditional Malagasy worldview is shaped by values that emphasize fihavanana  solidarity   vintana  destiny   tody  karma   and hasina  a sacred life force that traditional communities believe imbues and thereby legitimates authority figures within the community or family  Other cultural elements commonly found throughout the island include the practice of male circumcision  a traditional division of social classes into nobles  commoners  and slaves  strong kinship ties  and a widespread belief in the power of magic  diviners  astrology and witch doctors  15  115  Malagasy people traditionally consult Mpanandro   Makers of the Days   to identify the most auspicious days for important events such as weddings or famadihana  according to a traditional astrological system introduced by Arabs  Prior to French colonization the nobles of many Malagasy communities would commonly employ advisers known as the ombiasy  from olona be hasina   man of much virtue   of the southeastern Antemoro ethnic group who trace their ancestry back to early Arab settlers  119  The diverse origins of Malagasy culture are evident in its tangible expressions  Houses in Madagascar are typically four sided with a peaked roof and are traditionally constructed following a design  orientation and interior layout very similar to houses found in southeastern Borneo  120  Reflecting a widespread veneration of the ancestors  tombs are culturally significant in many regions and tend to be built of more durable material  typically stone  and display more elaborate decoration than the houses of the living  121  The zebu  humped cattle   introduced to Madagascar by Bantu speaking East African migrants about 1 000 years ago  have taken on sacred importance and embody the wealth of the owner  a tradition originating on the African mainland  Cattle rustling  originally a rite of passage for young men in the plains areas of Madagascar where the largest herds of cattle are kept  has become a dangerous and sometimes deadly criminal enterprise as herdsmen in the southwest attempt to defend their cattle with traditional spears against increasingly armed professional rustlers  45  The production and weaving of silk can be traced back to the island s earliest settlers  and Madagascar s national dress  the woven lamba  has evolved into a varied and refined art  122  The Southeast Asian cultural influence is also evident in Malagasy cuisine  in which rice is consumed at every meal  typically accompanied by one of a variety of flavorful vegetable or meat dishes  123  Arts Aloalo traditionally decorate tombs in some western coastal communities A wide range of aural artistic traditions have developed in Madagascar  One of the island s foremost artistic traditions is its oratory  as expressed in the forms of hainteny  poetry   kabary  public discourse  and ohabolana  proverbs   124  125  An epic poem exemplifying these traditions  the Ibonia  has been handed down over the centuries in several different forms across the island  and offers insight into the diverse mythologies and beliefs of traditional Malagasy communities  126  this tradition was continued in the 20th century by such artists as Jean Joseph Rabearivelo  who is considered Africa s first modern poet  127  and Elie Rajaonarison  an exemplar of the new wave of Malagasy poetry  128  Madagascar has also developed a rich musical heritage  embodied in dozens of regional musical genres such as the coastal salegy or highland hiragasy that enliven village gatherings  local dance floors and national airwaves  129  The plastic arts are also widespread throughout the island  In addition to the tradition of silk weaving and lamba production  the weaving of raffia and other local plant materials has been used to create a wide array of practical items such as floor mats  baskets  purses and hats  Wood carving is a highly developed art form  with distinct regional styles evident in the decoration of balcony railings and other architectural elements  Sculptors create a variety of furniture and household goods  aloalo funerary posts  and wooden sculptures  many of which are produced for the tourist market  The decorative and functional woodworking traditions of the Zafimaniry people of the central highlands was inscribed on UNESCO s list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2008  Among the Antaimoro people  the production of paper embedded with flowers and other decorative natural materials is a long established tradition that the community has begun to market to eco tourists  Embroidery and drawn thread work are done by hand to produce clothing  as well as tablecloths and other home textiles for sale in local crafts markets  A small but growing number of fine art galleries in Antananarivo  and several other urban areas  offer paintings by local artists  and annual art events  such as the Hosotra open air exhibition in the capital  contribute to the continuing development of fine arts in Madagascar  Sport and recreation A number of traditional pastimes have emerged in Madagascar  Moraingy  a type of hand to hand combat  is a popular spectator sport in coastal regions  It is traditionally practiced by men  but women have recently begun to participate  130  The wrestling of zebu cattle is also practiced in many regions  In addition to sports  a wide variety of games are played  Fanorona is a board game that is associated with the Merina sovereigns and is widespread throughout the Highland regions  According to folk legend  the succession of King Andrianjaka after his father Ralambo was partially due to the unhealthy obsession that Andrianjaka s older brother may have had with playing fanorona to the detriment of his other responsibilities  131  Western recreational activities were introduced to Madagascar over the past two centuries  Football and rugby are especially popular  Madagascar has produced a world champion in p tanque  a French game similar to lawn bowling  which is widely played in urban areas and throughout the Highlands  132  School athletics programs typically include soccer  track and field  judo  boxing  women s basketball and women s tennis  Madagascar sent its first competitors to the Olympic Games in 1964 and has also competed in the African Games  14 Scouting is represented in Madagascar by its own local federation of three scouting clubs  Membership in 2011 was estimated at 14 905  133  See also Geography portal Africa portal Madagascar portal Outline of Madagascar Index of Madagascar related articles Notes   a b Le Comit  Consultatif Constitutionnel
