storyline at Midtown Comics Times Square  December 21  2010   Fear Itself  began as a proposed Captain America Thor crossover by Matt Fraction  3  4  The storyline was first announced by then Marvel Editor in Chief Joe Quesada  Vice President Executive Editor Tom Brevoort and Vice President and X Men group editor Axel Alonso in a December 21  2010 press conference at Midtown Comics Times Square  Quesada explained that like the 2006 storyline  Civil War   the storyline of  Fear Itself  was inspired by the real world  in particular the perceived malaise and fear evoked by late 2000s events such as terror alerts  oil spills  the economy and partisan politics  Explains Quesada  5   The climate in the world today was certainly the inspiration for this as we started to think about the bigger stories for the Marvel Universe   Marvel editor in chief Joe Quesada said at a press conference at Midtown Comics in Manhattan   You will absolutely see the real world inject itself into this story because it s undeniable that there s a certain something in the air right now we tend to tap into that whether consciously or unconsciously and it effects  sic  all our stories   6  The storyline s title is a reference to a famous quote by Franklin D  Roosevelt   So  first of all  let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself nameless  unreasoning  unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance   as indicated by the use of a portion that quote as part of the soundtrack of the trailer presented during the Midtown press conference  5  The story s antagonist is the Serpent  an Asgardian being who sows doubt and fear among the superheroes of the Marvel Comics Universe  6  as illustrated by early promotional images for the event  which depict Spider Man  Hulk  Captain America  Cyclops  Thor  and Iron Man coming face to face with their worst nightmares  1  7  During this conflict  which is referred to among the characters as the Serpent s War  8  the Serpent is revealed to be Cul  Odin s brother  who assumed the throne of Asgard following the death of their father  Bor at the dawn of time  and was banished and imprisoned by Odin following Cul s corrupt rule  and a prophecy by Yggdrasil that cost Odin his right eye  and revealed that Cul s madness could only be cured by the death of Odin s son  9  10  Brevoort explained that all major characters are featured in the storyline  which involve a number of unconventional alliances  with even Marvel s version of Dracula participating in the event  Another god of fear  the adolescent Phobos  who is a member of the Secret Warriors  also appears in the series  Brevoort further explained that subtle hints of the storyline were planted well in advance  between approximately 15 months and two years prior to the miniseries  some of which may only be perceptible in hindsight  Brevoort and Alonso explained that although the story also ties into all of the company s other high profile titles  and presents stakes as high as an  extinction level event   the story could be understood by those who choose to read only the core Fear Itself miniseries  The related titles include the X Men family of books  1  7  with the exception of X Factor  11  Brandon Montclare  Michael Kaluta and Ryan Bodenheim at a June 8  2011 Midtown Comics

against one another as they compete to find the hammers of the Worthy that fell to Earth at the end of the main miniseries  110   edit  Reception Critics have exhibited mixed reaction to the work of the individual creators  praising the art in general  but have generally panned the writing as  pedestrian  bordering on silly   and with shops harboring copious titles that did not sell through  111  Roman Colombo of Weekly Comic Book Review commented   Fear Itself was a disaster  I don t see many people arguing that point the most that can be said is that it had some amazing tie ins   in particular Avengers Academy  Journey into Mystery and the later tie in issues of Uncanny X Men  112   edit  Prologue reviews Erik Norris of IGN gave the prologue a  Great  rating of 8 out of 10  saying it effectively set up the crossover storyline  calling Brubaker as  a master of Captain America s world   and hailing his vibrant depiction of the characters  his consistent scripting  and Scott Eaton s  gorgeous  artwork  with which he effectively captures character emotions such as Sin s wrath  113  Chad Nevett  reviewing the Fear Itself  Book of the Skull for Comic Book Resources  opined that it felt like a drawn out issue of Ed Brubaker s Captain America  and a lead in to the 2011 relaunch of that title  rather than an essential setup for  Fear Itself   Calling Brubaker s story and Scott Eaton s art  competent   Nevett characterized it as  a good comic  not great    an entertaining superhero action comic  and  your pretty standard  Red Skull crazy World War 2 scheme  plot with few surprises   Though he felt that Eaton s art was clear and the action shots energetic  he felt Eaton s line work was cluttered at times  his faces  bulging and scrunched at the same time  and in general  his work  generic   114  At Newsarama  David Pepose noted Brubaker s talent for mixing fun dialogue with action  but thought the book read  a little choppy   He described Scot Eaton s pencils as having  an exciting vibrancy   singling out his rendition of character close ups  but felt that in light of Marvel and Matt Fraction s promotion of the miniseries  that the prologue was unnecessary  115  Danny Djeljosevic of Comics Bulletin saw Book of the Skull as Brubaker s embracing of the silliness of the Marvel Universe  and also questioned if readers would need the prologue to appreciate the crossover  saying that Captain America s presence in the story felt more like a marketing ploy than a natural aspect of it  Djeljosevic found the supervillain interaction to be fun  and wished that it had been given the focus of the book  116  Alex Evans of Weekly Comic Book Review gave the book a  B   thought  despite his aversion to prologue books  for Brubaker s scripting  the accurate tone of each of the characters  comparing the combination of Nazis and paranormal elements to the work of Mike Mignola  as well as Eaton s  fantastic  art  Evans opined  however  that it did not function well as a prologue  because it did not inform him as to the nature of the upcoming storyline  117  Evan Narcisse  Graeme McMillan and Douglas Wolk of Time magazine s Techland website found the book to be  tepid   and stated that it failed to provide exposition for new readers  or to inform or intrigue readers as to the upcoming storyline  which they felt was emblematic about Marvel s  insular  approach to big event storylines  118   edit  Core miniseries reviews Characters standing before Yggdrasil at the end of Fear Itself  1  July 2011   one of the images for which the creative team of Stuart Immonen  Wade Von Grawbadger and Laura Martin were universally praised  By contrast  the core miniseries  writing drew more varied reactions  with multiple reviewers citing a high standard set by the early issues that were not met by the latter ones  Doug Zawisza  reviewing the Fear Itself miniseries for Comic Book Resources  commended writer Matt Fraction for the first two issues  praising his establishment of the story and tying it into Marvel Universe history in the first issue  while still making it enjoyable for new readers  119  Zawisza was less impressed with the issues 2   4  Though they enticed him to buy the tie in books  which he normally does not do with crossovers  he felt the story s shift of locales  the lack of resolution to its setups  the depiction of action in  snippets  and the relegation of important plot events to tie in books hurt the story  120  121  122  By issues 5 and 6  which Zawisza felt exhibited out of character dialogue  he felt the miniseries had failed to live up to the promise of the first issue  despite some powerful character defining moments  123  124  Zawisza was more favorable towards Stuart Immonen s art  calling it  incredible  and  gorgeous   and Immonen a  modern master  whose ability to convey a large amount of story in a small portion of a page Zawisza compared to that of George P rez  120  Though Zawisza was not reluctant to note the occasional error  121  He consistently singled out Immonen for his simple but detailed storytelling  and his ability to render varied subject matter  from Nazis to sea monsters  119  praising specific visuals such as his Immonen and Laura Martin s depiction of Yggdrasil in issue  1  as well as numerous scenes in issue  4  such as the scenes of global chaos  the Odin Serpent framing sequence and the shots of British Columbia  which he called  chilling   Zawisza also praised Wade Von Grawbadger s inks and Martin s colors  Despite his disappointment with the latter in issue  4  122  he singled issue  5 s rendition of a sequence spoken in runes and the electric blue lightning emanating from Thor s hammer as otherwise strong inking and coloring  respectively  123  Zawisza also positively compared Chris Eliopoulos  lettering to that of John Workman  122  At Newsarama  Jennifer Margret Smith praised Fraction s slow building of an uneasy fearful tone  his ability to play to smaller  less tangible emotions and for capturing the real world parallels of the country s mood and Steve Rogers  Barack Obama like characteristics in issue  1  125  George Marston felt the second issue built an air of paranoia and panic with an effective and utilitarian staccato pace  and enjoyed the surprising choices for the Worthy  saying that the series  main strength is relying on multiple ideas and story beats to create  a collective reading experience that may change the landscape of the Marvel Universe   which doesn t do so  at the expense of its own readability   126  Colin Bell felt the third issue was merely  passable   as it failed to depict the Worthy s actions in a consequential manner  and lacked gravitas until the end  127  Marston felt issue  4 exhibited more momentum and sweeping heroics  and contrasted Fraction s writing with Brian Michael Bendis  tendency to build events slowly  Marston conceded that the story s major beats could be perceived for their shock value  but contrasted this with the  little moments  that he felt stood out  128  Newsarama s reviewers consistently gave high ratings to the entire art team  with Smith commenting   It s Immonen who really shines   125  and Marston describing the entire art team as  the perfect blend of depth and deceptive simplicity   126  Immonen and Von Grawbager s  frenetic energy   and Laura Martin as Marvel s  go to colorist  injecting every page with mood  atmosphere  and clarity   128  Looking over the entire miniseries in his review of issue  7  Marston noted that it contained both breathtaking moments and  dragging nonsense   the latter particularly evident in the final two issues  Marston felt issue  7 in particular contained a rushed climax and an overall lack of exposition  resonance and depth for what should ve been important elements of the story  which he felt was emblematic of the miniseries  Marston criticized the epilogue pages for being devoted to upcoming spinoff books instead of these elements  129  At Comics Bulletin  a roundtable review of issue  1 by five reviews resulted in an average rating of 3 7 out of 5 bullets  The reviewers generally praised the writing and art  though Ray Tate  who expressed an aversion to large scale  event  storylines  questioned the first issue s execution  and perceived out of character behavior on the part of Odin  Norse mythology fan Thom Young stated that certain elements did not resonate or ring true to him  130  Danny Djeljosevic gave issue  2 a rating of 3 5 bullets  again praising the tension building of the story and the art  131  For issue  3  Shawn Hill rated it 3 5  stating that art and characterization justified continued patronage of the series  but that the plot did not  while Sam Salama Coh n exhibited an overall more positive reaction  with 4 5 bullets  132  Djeljosevic gave 4 bullets to issue  4  complimenting Fraction for hitting his stride as he scripted  the most technically daunting task in his comics career   and singling out the parallel scenes of Odin and the Serpent rallying their troops in particular  Like Doug Zawisza  Djeljosevic was impressed by Stuart Immonen s ability to effectively render different subjects  from sleepy seaside Canadian towns to superheroe battles  and remarking   Immonen is easily the most versatile artist in comics  who will surely go down as one of the greats with his striking layouts and dynamic  varied panel to panel storytelling  Immonen reminds me of the old school Marvel Comics artists  who were capable of delivering strong  consistent work every month with little need for fill ins   133  Jason Serafino of Complex magazine  in reviewing issue  6  stated   The Fear Itself series has stalled somewhat after a strong debut issue   but equivocated   It s tough to ask for too much from a series that hinges on little more than some widescreen action and incredible art  Just sit back  relax  and enjoy the mayhem   134  Jesse Schedeen of IGN rated the first two issues a  Great  8 5 out of 10 and a  Good  7 5  respectively  saying that the story and characterization were well executed by Fraction  including the nuanced  weighty Norse dialogue  Schedeen also thought Immonen s wide  cinematic panels were  top notch   and Laura Martin s colors  characteristically lush and beyond reproach   but thought Wade von Grawbadger s inks were thicker and slightly less precise than on his previous New Avengers work  However  Schedeen rated three of the following four issues a  Good  or  Okay  6 5  and the final issue an  Okay  6 0  citing lack of context of the story s global events  poor characterization and dialogue  reliance on events relegated to tie in books  use of too many of the final pages for epilogues and an overall sense that the series failed to surpass its origins as a Thor Captain America crossover  3  135  136  137  138  139  4  Alex Evans of Weekly Comic Book Review gave a  B   to three of the first four issues  saying that Fraction effected a a sincere  topically relevant and emotionally authentic story rather than marketing ploy or editorial shuffle that exploited the scene jumping structure to properly explore the expansive  global impact of the Worthy as a legitimate threat  handled Bucky s death well and did a good job with Loki s humorous dialogue  However  Evans decried the too straightforward treatment of Sin s setup  and the lack of Fraction s usual subtext in issue  3  which he graded  B     Evans and Dean Stell graded the next three issues C    C   and  D   expressing that  despite the exciting battles  the issues were marred by a transitional feel  redundant material covered in tie ins  a  hideous  deus ex machina use of Franklin Richards  massive but ill defined powers  a ludicrous opening scene in issue  6  choppy storytelling  meaningless character deaths  and lack of closure  Stell called it a  crappy  series based on a  thin  concept that warranted neither seven issues nor the copious tie in books  The reviewers thought the art and colors were vibrant and detailed  and Immonen the perfect choice for the series  though Stell thought it looked a bit rushed in issue  6  and not up to Immonen s usual standards in issue  7  140  141  142  143  144  145  146   edit  Tie in book reviews Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave Fear Itself  Sin s Past  1 a  Mediocre  rating of 5 out 10  saying that the issues chosen for reprinting were not the ideal ones from which readers could learn about the character  as the character s first appearances did not feature her disfigured  skull like appearance  did little to flesh out her character and the modern and because the bold  modern coloring did not mesh with Al Milgrom s soft pencils  whose detailing of Rich Buckler s layouts issue  355 were inconsistent in quality to begin with  34  Schedeen gave Fear Itself  The Worthy  1 an  Okay  rating of 6 out of 10  opining that while the origin stories  they were not particularly memorable  owing to their limited page space  that Sin s segment was a rehash of the Book of the Skull prologue  and that while the Hulk and Thing segments were outstanding in terms of the writing by Greg Pak and Roberto Aguirre Sacasa and the artwork by Lee Weeks and Javier Pulido  the entire book was available for free on Comixology  35  Page from Journey into Mystery  625  October 2011   a tie in book for which both Kieron Gillen s writing and Doug Braithwaite and Ulises Arreola s art were widely applauded  Alex Evans  reviewing issues 622   626 of Journey into Mystery for Weekly Comic Book Review  gave a grade of  A   to the first issue  and an  A   to the next three  He called the first four issues  brilliant   repeatedly lauding their consistent excellence from month to month  and naming the series one of Marvel s best comics  saying the first issue was the best one of the year thus far  Evans described Gillen s child Loki story as  perfection   and hailed Gillen s ability to tie in seemingly digressive elements as thematically relevant  his issue structure and his facility for narration and dialogue  as well as the humor  adventure and characterization  Evans called Braithwaite s art and Ulises Arreola s colors  stunning  and  epic   finding it to be on a higher level than other comics art  and comparable to that found in a fantasy storybook  which he felt made the Asgardian environment seem  immense  important  and full of life   Evans and D S  Arsenault gave a  B   to issues 626 and 630  respectively  with Evans that despite being  absolutely fantastic   his grade was due simply to the exceptionally high standard set by the prior issues  and that Surtur and the troika of Try  Leah and the Disir not as interesting  Arsenault cited Loki s  heroically comic  scene stealing  and aside from not enjoying the visuals in the flashback sequence as much  whose purpose he conceded he understood   he thought the book a  hoot  that new readers would enjoy  147  148  149  150  151  152  Chad Nevett and Ryan K  Lindsay of Comic Book Resources gave 4 out of 5 stars to issues 622  624 and 625  and 3 5 stars to issues 623 and 626  seeing it as superior to the core miniseries  The reviewers praised the intelligence  structure and  cerebral  narrative of Gillen s of Thor and Loki s new relationship set against Asgardian politics  calling it a  glorious tale   and an improvement over his previous Thor work  Also mentioned were Gillen s whimsical captions   tight dialogue  and his ability to plant narrative seeds and follow through purposefully with winding plot twists  They also noted Braithwaite s  intricate    amazing art  and Arreola s colors  and how this lent itself to depicting Loki s various moods  153  154  155  156  157  Rich Johnston of Bleeding Cool positively compared issue  623 to the 2011 Thor feature film  calling it the  perfect comic  for presenting Asgard in a  grandly poetic  light   epic  and  beautiful   Johnston praised the book for the complexity in which it elevated Loki as a more impressive character than Thor  158  Reviewers at Comics Bulletin gave 4 out of 5 bullets to Journey Into Mystery  622  624 and 625  giving Kieron Gillen high marks for his storytelling  characterization  humor and satisfyingly brisk pace  and Doug Braithwaite for his  wondrously detailed  art  159  160  161  Jesse Schedeen of IGN  who gave issue  623 a  Great  rating of 8 5 out of 10  also enjoyed Gillen s  refined and almost lyrical  dialogue  and the art  though he felt the colors needed some adjustment  162  Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave issue  627 a  Great  rating of 8 0 out of 10  saying that what was essentially a filler issue was elevated by the creative team s execution  and that Rich Elson s made an appropriate substitution for artist Doug Braithwaite  but that the lettering was too small and indistinct  163  Schedeen gave issue  630 an  Amazing  rating of 9 out of 10  calling Gillen s Volstagg tale a  classic  and the series  Marvel s best ongoing book   He compared it to the  Wiz Kids  segment of the 2001 Simpsons episode  Treehouse of Horror XII   and applauded its humor  emotion  the rendition of the different sides of Volstagg s personality  and the manner in which guest artist Rich Elson s refined  precise pencils addressed the previous problems Schedeen perceived in the series  164  Roman Colombo of Weekly Comic Book Review gave a  B   to The Mighty Thor  7  saying that the prequel story of Odin and the Serpent s childhood did such a good job of providing a setup for the main storyline  and its impact so palpable that it should have been part of the prologue  In addition to the book s appropriately non colloquial dialogue among the gods  Colombo felt that because of the much needed characterization to the Serpent  which Colombo felt the main miniseries lacked  he would be more invested in re reading that miniseries  He felt Pasqual Ferry s art was hit or miss  however  112  Erik Norris of IGN gave the book a  Mediocre  score of 5 5 out of 10  saying that issue was a  ho hum filler  that did not provide context to Thor s death  nor accomplish anything not covered by the core miniseries  saying the book s revelations might have been topical and poignant had it been published before the miniseries was  Norris felt the transition from a young Odin to aged one was handled poorly  criticized the rendition of the Worthy as the contemporary characters that are possessed by them in the miniseries  165  Alex Evans  reviewing New Avengers  14 and 15 for Weekly Comic Review  graded them  A   and  B   calling the first issue the best since the series  first story arc  due to writer Brian Michael Bendis  intimate character work with Mockingbird  and artist Mike Deodato s ability to capture the most subtle nuances of emotion in facial expressions  Regarding the next issue  Evans thought that while it was not as compelling as the previous one  Bendis nonetheless fleshed out Squirrel Girl into a  fully realized  sympathetic character   disproving his initial expectations upon learning that it focused on Squirrel Girl  166  167  CBR s Greg McElhatton enjoyed Nick Spencer s script for Secret Avengers  13  in particular the lateral thinking McElhatton felt Spencer employed in seizing the opportunity to do a different take on  Fear Itself   Though he was impressed with the story s ability to stand on its own without requiring reading a different title  he did not care for its reliance on coincidence  McElhatton also enjoyed Scot Eaton s pencils  in particular his rendition of Beast and of the fight scenes  but noted that Adi Granov s cover to the book included a number of characters not in it  168  Alex Evans of Weekly Comic Book Review gave the issue a  B    commending Spencer for keeping the story topical with a sense of anxiety that transcended the story s villains  and for his work with both the Beast and Lenny s friendship and with Ant Man  Evans also called Scott Eaton s art  incredibly polished  detailed  and high budget   as seen in both the attack on Washington  DC and the character s reactions to it  Evans said the book fulfilled all the criteria for a good tie in book  including a message that avoided being overly sentimental or silly  169  Ray Tate gave 5 out of 5 bullets to Avengers Academy  15  but only three bullets to issue  16  Conceding he was disinterested in the crossover s core miniseries  he nonetheless liked Christos Gage s exploration of Tigra in Academy  15  but thought issue  16 to be a  mixed bag   saying that while the creative team succeeded in making the Veil story resonant  the drama of the Absorbing Man and Titania did not engage him  despite being technically good  170  171  Dean Stell of Weekly Comic Book Review gave a  B   to issue  18  calling it a good opportunity for readers looking to read new characters  and as a someone whose first comic was Secret Wars  Stell was delighted by the use of Titania and Absorbing Man  though he thought the story could have been told in one issue instead of three  He also thought the art was effective  but was not enamored of what he thought was an overly highlighted coloring style  172  Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave of  Okay  rating of 6 5 out of 10 to issue  20  based on less than ideal scene transitions  bad pacing and Tom Raney s  underwhelming  art  which he felt looked rushed in many pages  Schedeen felt the series overall suffered from lack of focus on the entire team  173  Ray Tate of Comics Bulletin gave 2 out of 5 bullets to Fear Itself  Youth in Revolt  1  attributing this to confusing plotting  implausible behavior on the part of bit characters and lack of independence from the core miniseries  However  he expressed enjoyment of Sean McKeever s characterization of the heroes  in particular Thor Girl  as well as Mike Norton and Veronica Gandini s art  174  Tate gave the next two issues 5 out of 5 bullets  however  again mentioning his enjoyment of Thor Girl and the art team s work in issue  2  175  and the Hardball story in issue  3  176  Jesse Schedeen at IGN gave the first two issues  Good  ratings of 7 and 7 5  impressed with how many characters McKeever was able to fit and properly define in the series  but unimpressed with how McKeever failed to make abstract fear concept palpable  or to distinguish the book from other tie ins with similar concepts  177  178  Schedeen gave  Great  ratings of 8 out of 10 to the next two issues  for the gravitas in the books that the main miniseries lacked  in particular the brutal death scene  which he contrasted with to the Bucky death scene in Fear Itself  3  for how McKeever s handling of the heroes  internal conflict  and his development of Gravity  Schedeen likened the depiction of the low point of the Initiative s crisis to the classic Marvel Team Up  41  1975  in which Spider Man was trapped under tons of rubble  Schedeen consistently had kind words for Norton s  clean  expressive pencils   179  180  181  Dean Stell of Weekly Comic Book Review gave a  B  and  B   to the first two issues  pleased with McKeever s ability to write younger characters  in particular Thor Girl  Cloud 9 and Ultragirl  and utilizing B list and C list characters  which he felt added depth to the main series  Though he advised readers that it was not essential to the crossover  he enjoyed it more than the first two issues of the core miniseries  He felt the riots  however  marred the story  as he did not think them a believable reaction to  fear   He also said that Norton s art was a  recipe for success   182  183  Alex Evans  who reviewed Invincible Iron Man  504   506 for Weekly Comic Book Review  gave the first two issues a  B    and the third one a  B   lauding writer Matt Fraction for using Iron Man s haunting discovery of Mokk s victims to set a chilling tone and atmosphere of the crossover  reminding Evans of the Minotaur in the Cretan Labyrinth  while still maintaining the unique dynamic and relationship of Stark and Pepper Potts through dialogue  Also singled out was his tying up of the Detroit Steel rivalry from the  Stark Resilient  storyline  and the development of Potts and Cabe  Evans questioned  however  the pacing in issue 504  and the use of runes for dwarven profanity in 506  Evans called Salvador Larroca s art  perfect   specifying his design of Grey Gargoyle Mokk  and the facial expressions with which he depicted Tony s reactions to the stone Parisians  but criticized his rendition of the dwarves  facial expressions for not matching their dialogue  184  185  186  Evans gave a  D    however  to Iron Man 2 0  5  however  criticizing Nick Spencer for focusing on Iron Fist and the Immortal Weapons rather than the book s star  and the all set up nature of the story  and Ariel Olivetti for his  unnatural and stiff  artwork  and his  horrendous  computer generated backgrounds  which according to Evans  were either nonexistent or little more than slightly manipulated photos  187  Dean Stell  reviewing Hulk  36 and 37 for Weekly Comic Book Review  graded them  B   and  A    repeatedly congratulating the skilled exposition with which writer Jeff Parker effectively used an old villain Stell wasn t familiar with  the development of Anne  his ability to maintain his ongoing story despite the tie in  letterer Ed Dukeshire s handling of Parker s text heavy script  and the use of the  spider legs  version of MODOK s exoskeleton  which Stell made him legitimately  sinister and creepy  instead of  dorky   Stell also took notice of Bettie Breitweiser s colors and lighting  which she felt were the only ones that depicted the Worthy in a way that they did not appear to be  Tron rejects   188  189  Joshua Yehl of IGN Fear Itself  Hulk vs Dracula  1 an  Okay  rating of 6 out of 10  citing the dull  formulaic nature of the conflict  which was already seen in numerous other tie in books  While Yehl thought Ryan David Stegman s settings were solid and featured intricately detailed backgrounds  the character work failed to inspire awe or fear  64  Ryan Schedeen  however  while not feeling the miniseries made the best use of the three issue format  gave 8 0  Great  and 7 0  Good  ratings to issues  2 and  3  respectively  finding the former an enthralling if mindless action romp with tense character drama  and comparing Stegman s style positively to that of Ed McGuinness  while also lamenting that the change of inker and colorist near the end of issue  3 harmed the art s overall quality  190  191  Dean Stell of Weekly Comic Book Review gave issue  3 a  B    citing the political intrigue of Dracula and the various breeds and factions of vampires  the introduction of the Forgiven  the sense that the book created something  new   compared to the other tie ins that he felt went in circles  the balance between cartooniness and realism in Ryan Stegman s pencils  and the manner in which Mike Babinski and Rick Magyar s inks maintained that strength  65  Reviewing Fear Itself  The Black Widow  Kelly Thompson of Comic Book Resources criticized the in media res structure  saying that instead of the payoff demanded by such an approach  the result is an  eye rolling deus ex machina like cheat that in any movie theater would illicit vocal groans   Though Thompson was pleased with writer Cullen Bunn s pacing  clarity and his handling of the character  and thought Peter Nguyen s art interesting if inconsistent  Thompson found the story heavy handed  criticized it for employing wordy naration over visual storytelling  and thought the book a throwaway story not relevant to  Fear Itself   192  Ray Tate gave the book 4 out of 5 bullets  likening the story to  an Alias like hyperkinetic spy mission  that succeeds where other creators  interpretations of the character failed  and which will satisfy ardent fans of the character  Tate attributed the narrative s fluidity to Peter Nguyen s character designs  which he compared to Peter Chung s Aeon Flux  and also applauded Veronica Gandini s colors  193  Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the book a  Good  rating of 7 out of 10  describing it as a pointless tie in with little effective conflict that does not fit well with the main storyline  albeit an enjoyable one with spy flavored hijinks  and art that is fluid and energetic  if lacking in facial expressions  194  Jesse Schedeen  reviewing Fear Itself  Spider Man for IGN  gave issue  1 a  Good  rating of 7 5 out of 10  and  Great  ratings of 8 5 and 8 to issues 2 and 3  Despite thinking that the citizens depicted were a bit too archetypal  he felt issue  1 properly covered the effects of the Serpent on the populace that were ignored by Fear Itself  2 that week  including those inflicted on Spider Man that formed a classic set of insurmountable circumstances for him that rivaled his fight with Morlun in the 2005 2006  The Other  storyline  Schedeen felt Mike McKone s art was clean and cinematic  but varied between his familiar style and a flat  minimalist one in issue  1  Though issue  2 improved on this  he felt aspects of it were flat and rushed in issue  3  195  196  197  Dean Stell of Weekly gave a  C  grade to the first two issues  saying that while it wasn t essential to the event  it established the street level panic caused by it  providing  flavoring  to the crossover s story not present in the core miniseries  and that it featured many fine moments  his favorite of which was Spider Man s confrontation with J  Jonah Jameson  He nonetheless perceived problems in continuity and in the behavior of the mob attacking the Iranian cabbie  He also thought McKone s art was solid and effective  despite occasional problems in body proportions  198  199  James Hunt of Comic Book Resources praised issue  1 for  straddling the crossover line expertly   telling a genuine story rather than serving as an arbitrary tie in  and for helping to allow the reader to understand the stakes of  Fear Itself  by showing the chaos created in the core miniseries  Though Hunt questioned the book s choice of villain  he was interested enough to see how the story s use of that villain would develop  Hunt also Mike McKone s art and Jeremy Cox s colors  and their decision to depict a red and black version of Spider Man s costume  200  Reviewing Fear Itself  The Deep  1  Hunt opined that the book was not an essential tie in  He criticized the destruction of New Atlantis  without any mention of Utopia  which was supported by New Atlantis  He also thought that the development of Namor  while potentially interesting  did not entirely work  Though he suggested that Defenders fans would enjoy the book s improvised incarnation of that team  and Lee Garbett s art clear and enjoyable  there was little to either complain about or distinguish it  201  Ray Tate gave the book 4 out of 5 bullets  however  finding the change in the Defenders roster engaging  Loa in particular   and beautifully characterized  Tate also liked the creative team s design of the demons  and their rendition of the cast and their heroics  202  Jesse Schedeen of IGN rated issue  1 of  Mediocre  5 5 out 10  finding the characterization at times erratic  inaccurate and flat  in particular that of Namor and Attuma  While Schedeen thought Garbett s art was  functional  if a little cramped  in the underwater scenes  he perceived a sharp divide in quality between his cover and interior work  and the colors to be too dim  203  At Comic Book Resources  Zawisza found Fear Itself  The Home Front  1 to be  somewhere between forced and irrelevant   Zawisza criticized the Speedball story for a too weighty collection of elements that threatened to stall it  and for artist Mike Mayhew s over reliance on photo reference  Zawisza criticized Peter Milligan s Agents of Atlas story for lacking  pizzazz   a clear direction and consistent characterization  but found Elia Bonetti s art a nice transition between Mayhew s and Howard Chaykin s  Zawisza found the J  Jonah Jameson story  little more than a one page filler   though useful in reminder the reader of Jameson s presence in the Marvel Universe  Zawisza found Pepe Larraz s art in the Broxton  Oklahoma story to be energetic and clean  and his characters believable  Overall  Zawisza felt the book did not add to  Fear Itself   but was a  nice  read  even if not a  must read   204  Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave issue  1 a  Good  rating of 7 out of 10  saying that Gage handled the Speedball story with more depth and gravity than in the Avengers Academy that featured a similar story  and that the exploration of why the Superhuman Registration Act was abolished was welcome  though he questioned if the story was strong enough to go seven issues  Schedeen also enjoyed the story and art of Agents of Atlas  thought the inclusion of the J  Jonah Jameson tale was  bizarre   and felt Jim McCann s Broxton story explored the human element  if not memorably  and that overall  the book was not essential reading  78  He gave the next two issues  Okay  ratings of 6 and 6 5  explaining that the backup stories should ve been trimmed to give more space to the Baldwin story  in which Gage fleshed out Miriam Sharpe  and that while the Agents of Atlas work continued to be solid in issue  2  it wasn t making great use of the crossover  205  206  Dean Stell  reviewing Uncanny X Men  540   543 for Weekly Comic Book Review  graded the issues  D     C     B   and  D   Stell consistently denounced Greg Land s art  which  despite exhibiting good linework and a cinematic style  suffered  according to Stell  from over reliance on photo reference  and constant reuse of a limited number of poses and facial expressions  in particular the same face used for all the female characters  Stell also was unimpressed with Land s storytelling  his questionable choice in depicting Cyclops with beard stubble and putting Emma Frost in a cowgirl outfit for no discernible reason  and with Justin Ponsor s color palette and overabundance of highlights  Regarding the writing  he thought the first issue had an average story  and the next two were  pretty good   but disliked the final issue  Although he loved the thrashing that Colossus gave Juggernaut after decades of stories in which the latter dispatched the former  he disliked the Namor Emma Frost romance  the Kitty Peter drama  and Cyclops  haughty demeanor toward the Mayor of San Francisco  207  208  209  210  Hunt felt that Fear Itself  Uncanny X Force  1  however  was one of the stronger tie in books  opining that writer Rob Williams lived up to the standard set by regular X Force writer Rick Remender  exhibiting a similar density of ideas  well pitched character work  and the same  fun  of that book  without aping Remender s writing style  However  Hunt felt the story suffered from being almost unrelated to the core  Fear Itself  storyline  and criticized the lack of lack of clarity over the identity of the  unknown superhero  in danger  stating that it failed to invest the reader in his fate  Hunt also felt that Simone Bianchi s art was looser than on his Astonishing X Men run  and criticized his lack of backgrounds  but enjoyed his intricate visuals and his restrained rendering  211  Jesse Schedeen of IGN  however  gave each of the three issues  Mediocre  ratings of 5 5  5 0 and 5 5 out of 10  complaining that the story was barely related to the crossover  that the characterization was  bland  and unengaging  the humor  stilted   that it was entertaining on only a superficial level  and of Simone Bianchi s poorly defined and figure crowded page construction  bizarre anatomy and storytelling that lacked a proper flow  212  213  214  Hunt was pleased with Fear Itself  Wolverine  1  in particular its depiction of Wolverine and Melita s relationship  and their contrasting views on informational freedom  Though he saw potential in the otherwise generic S T R I K E  mercenaries  he again was displeased that the story had nothing to do with the core  Fear Itself  narrative  While Hunt felt artist Roland Boschi made writer Seth Peck s heavy exposition effective  and found Dan Brown s colors serviceable  he found little inspiring about the book artistically  215  Poet Mase of IGN gave issue  1 an  Okay  rating of 6 5 out of 10  saying that while he felt the villain s plot was plausible  it was somewhat stifled under the weight of text exposition that should ve been handled by the visuals  and was unimpressed by Boschi s art or Dan Brown s colors  with some frames looking unfinished  216  He felt these issues were resolved by issue  2  which he rated a  Good  7 5 for being a good middle issue  Nonetheless  while he felt that Peck s focus on the power of fear over rationality  and the buildup of Melita s panic were well done  he felt her journey through Manhattan to be somewhat aimless  a major plot point dispensed with via a poor plot device  and the final page a letdown  217  Dean Stell  reviewing New Mutants  30 for Weekly Comic Book Review  gave it a  B  for Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning s fun story  its good use of Mephisto  David Lafuente s  A List  art  whose exaggerated gestures lent itself well to the storytelling  and Val Staples and Chris Sotomayor s colors  218  Reviewing Thunderbolts  158   162  Stell gave a  B   to the first and last issues  and a  B  to the middle three  citing writer Jeff Parker s effortless integration of the crossover into the book  his ability to fit large amounts of story into each issue with good pacing and his depiction of tension and relationship development of the team members  Stell also opined that all of the stories by different creators in the anthology issue  159 were good  Parker s Underbolts story in particular   However  he criticized the rehashing of material in issue 158 that was covered in the main miniseries  and Marvel editorial  however for inconsistency in Man Thing s appearances in different books of the crossover  Stell enjoyed Kev Walker and Declan Shalvey s illustration of individual issues  an improvement over pre crossover attempts on their part to share the duties  citing Walker s inking in particular  but was slightly disappointed by Valentine de Landro and Matthew Southworth s art  whose storytelling clarity was not substandard in areas  and whose overly buxom depiction of Moonstone clashed with Walker and Shalvey s  67  68  69  219  70  Jamil Scalese of Comics Bulletin gave 4 out of 5 bullets to issue  160  also cheered Parker s crossover tie in abilities  recalling his Thunderbolts work during the 2010  Shadowland  storyline  and commending Declan Shalvey s rendition of the characters as  superb   and the style he employed when depicting the heroes infiltrating Juggernaut s soul  220  Minhquan Nguyen  reviewing Herc  3   6 for Weekly Comic Book Review  gave a  B   to three of the issues  and an  A   to issue  4  Nguyen appreciated that the minor connection to the crossover did not hijack the book s in progress storyline  which was filled with action and humor  though he felt the writing in the latter two issues was hurried and underdeveloped  Nguyen praised penciler Neil Edwards  clean  detailed art  and how his design of the mythic characters  combined both classical and modern elements  He also complimented Scott Hanna s inks and Jesus Aburtov s colors  221  222  223  224  Sam Salama Coh n of Comics Bulletin gave 3 5 bullets to issue  4  celebrating Greg Pak and Fred Van Lente s accurate portrayal of Hercules  a welcome reinvigoration of the character following the  endless Limbo of poor characterization and mockery  to which Coh n felt the Greek hero had thus far been relegated  Coh n also said that Neil Edwards  art style had grown on him  extolling Edwards  depiction of both Hercules   snarkiness  and his bold resolve  Though Coh n felt the book was a good follow up on the previous story arc  he felt it lacked that story s perfect mix of humor  action and foreboding  225  Alex Evans of Weekly Comic Book Review gave a  C   to Ghost Rider  1  opining that the book featured some excellent ideas and solid artwork by Matthew Clark that were hampered by the crossover and some at times  sketchy  writing  which included flat humor  overwritten dialogue  the relegation of expository material to the backup story and an unlikable protagonist threatening children  226  Doug Zawisza found Fear Itself  Fearsome Four  1 s attempt to marry the disparate art styles of Michael William Kaluta  Ryan Bodenheim  and Simon Bisley uneven and inconsistent  in particular their different renderings of Howard the Duck   even though each artist served their purpose  with the end result reading like  a poor man s anthology that s written to fill a projected collected edition than a coherent run at a single tale   Zawisza thought the book was  slow and choppy   the characters an  odd assortment   and not worth the price of the next issue  227  At Comics Bulletin  Ray Tate gave four bullets and three bullets to issues 1 and 2  respectively  saying that in the first issue  Montclare s characterization was authentic and exhibited pathos  and Kaluta adept in his rendition of Nighthawk  recalling his previous work on DC Comics  equivalent character  but was somewhat perplexed by the resemblance of Bodenheim s Howard the Duck to the feature film version  Regarding issue  2  he thought Montclare s exposition of Frankenstein s whereabouts since the 1970s was intelligent  and Ryan Bodenheim s art strong  but thought Montclare s characterization of Nighthawk gratuitous and implausible  and found Bisley s art  scratchy  unattractive and often confusing   228  229  Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave issue  1 a  Mediocre  rating of 5 5  saying that despite the clever premise  citing a lack of emotional appeal or any narrative rationale in the choice of the book s cast  the inconsistent tone  and an artist roster that creates a  jumbled  feel  230  Dean Stell of Weekly Comic Book Review gave the issue a grade of  D   saying that it had an acceptable premise that was badly executed  citing the choice of characters used in the story  and Bodenheim s art  which deviated from his usual style  and in some areas looked rushed  or appeared to be an attempt to ape Mike Kaluta s style  231  Danny Djeljosevic and Nick Hanover of Comics Bulletin gave 3 out of 5 bullets to Alpha Flight  1  seeing its tie in to  Fear Itself  as a forced way to use the crossover to gain attention for that team  while only paying lip service to the crossover s storyline  They also complained about the heavy handed opening scenes  the lack of exposition that would make  Fear Itself  aspects of the story confusing to readers of the trade paperback and problematic characterizations of Shaman and Snowbird  The reviewers were both disappointed with the art  with Hanover criticizing Dale Eaglesham for  the worst artistic interpretation of Vancouver I ve ever seen   232  Joshua Yehl of Broken Frontier thought Pak and Van Lente succeeded in evoking a sense of dread  as well as a sense of natural humor  and described Eaglesham s art as  masterful throughout   233  Dean Stell of Weekly Comic Book Review gave the issue a  B  for recapturing the feel of the 1980s series  and describing it as  mostly a big  fast paced fight scene that works really well and is enjoyable to read   though he was disinterested by the political aspects of the plot  and disliked the use of Northstar  234  Dean Stell of Weekly Comic Book Review gave Fear Itself  Deadpool  1 a  C    saying that while the story s lack of impact on the crossover made it inessential reading  the concept of Deadpool s attempt to exploit the global panic upheld the book s signature tongue in cheek tone  and Bong Dazo s art fit this tone well  235  Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave issue  1 an  Okay  rating of 6 0  expressing the view that Deadpool s exploitation of a suburban family s paranoia and fear was so close sentiments in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks that writer Christopher Hastings struck at the heart of the crossover s core ideas  and that although some elements were characterized by dawdling exposition  spoilers and heavy handed attempts at humor  penciller Bong Dazo was adroitly brought the physical humor to life  236  However  Schedeen gave issue  3 an  Awful  rating of 3 5  saying that Hastings   painful  script consisted of a truncated plot  forced  unfunny cultural references  unresolved plot holes  and a nonsensical ending  and that despite Dazo s art  he advised readers not to buy the book  237   edit  Epilogue and aftermath book reviews Erik Norris of IGN Fear Itself  7 1  Captain America a  Great  rating of 8 5 out of 10  saying that Ed Brubaker and Jackson Guice offer more substantial content than in the entire core miniseries  calling it a  must read  for Captain America fans  including those who did not like the  Fear Itself  event  and saying that Brubaker admirably redeems the poor depiction of Bucky s death in the miniseries  30  Norris gave Fear Itself  7 2  Thor a  Good  rating of 7 out of 10  saying that Matt Fraction s subtle  vague handling of Thor s death and resurrection properly utilized meta concepts that incorporated the event into Norse mythology  Norris also praised Fraction s handling of Spider Man  He was disappointed with Adam Kubert s art  however  in spite of the fact that he is a fan of Kubert  finding the artist s choice of panel layout and composition perplexing  32  Joey Esposito of IGN gave a 7 out of 10  Good  rating to Fear Itself  The Fearless  1  saying that while it is not essential reading  nor an enticement to read the crossover  it provided a fun  enjoyable setup for ongoing stories featuring Sin and Valkyrie  despite some instances of flat dialogue  Esposito also noted the strengths and weaknesses of artists Paul Pelletier  Danny Miki  Matthew Wilson and Mark Bagley  saying   Neither artist completely nails it out of the park to the best of their ability  but the book gels well enough to entice the reader s eyeballs   110   edit  Titles involved  edit
