Kingdom of Denmark  Danish  Kongeriget Danmark  pronounced   k    i     danm       listen   is a constitutional monarchy and sovereign state consisting of the country of Denmark  English i  d nm  k   Danish  Danmark  help info   in northern Europe and two autonomous constituent countries  the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic and Greenland in North America  The kingdom is a unitary state with some power being devolved from Denmark proper to Greenland and the Faroe Islands  this federacy is referred to as the Danish Realm  Denmark proper is the hegemonial area  where judicial  executive  and legislative power resides  5  The Faroe Islands are defined to be a community of people within the kingdom  and the Greenlandic people are defined as a separate people with the right to self determination  6  7  Denmark itself is the southernmost of the Nordic countries  located southwest of Sweden and south of Norway  and bordered to the south by Germany  The country consists of a large peninsula  Jutland and many islands  most notably Zealand  Funen  Lolland  Falster and Bornholm  as well as hundreds of minor islands often referred to as the Danish Archipelago  Denmark s history has particularly been influenced by its geographical location between the North and Baltic seas  This meant that it was between Sweden and Germany and thus at the center of the mutual struggle for control of the Baltic Sea  before the digging of the Kiel Canal  water passage to the Baltic Sea was possible only through the three channels known as the  Danish straits   Denmark was long in disputes with Sweden over control of Sk nelandene  Scanian War  and Norway  and in disputes with the Hanseatic League over the duchies of Schleswig  a Danish fief  and Holstein  a German fief   Eventually Denmark lost the conflicts and ended up ceding first Sk nelandene to Sweden and later Schleswig Holstein to the German Empire  Denmark became a member of the European Union in 1973 but remains outside the Eurozone  while both Greenland and the Faroe Islands have opted to remain outside the EU entirely  A founding member of NATO and the OECD  Denmark is also a member of the Organisation for Security and Co operation in Europe  OSCE   With a mixed market economy and a large welfare state  Denmark ranks as having the world s highest level of income equality  The country has the world s seventh highest per capita income  It has frequently ranked as the happiest and least corrupt country in the world  In 2011  Denmark was listed 16th on the Human Development Index and 2nd on the Corruption Perceptions Index  The national language  Danish  is closely related to Swedish and Norwegian  with which it shares strong cultural and historical ties  Denmark  along with Sweden and Norway  is part of the cultural region known as  Scandinavia  and is also a member of the Nordic Council  Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 2 1 Prehistory 2 2 Viking Age 2 3 Medieval Denmark 2 4 Early modern history 2 5

Cuisine 7 11 Sports 8 See also 9 References 10 External links  edit  Etymology The etymology of the word Denmark  and especially the relationship between Danes and Denmark and the unifying of Denmark as a single kingdom  is a subject which attracts some debate  8  9  This is centred primarily around the prefix  Dan  and whether it refers to the Dani or a historical person Dan and the exact meaning of the   mark  ending  The issue is further complicated by a number of references to various Dani people in Scandinavia or other places in Europe in Greek and Roman accounts  like Ptolemy  Jordanes  and Gregory of Tours   as well as some mediaeval literature  like Adam of Bremen  Beowulf  Widsith and Poetic Edda   Most handbooks derive 10  the first part of the word  and the name of the people  from a word meaning  flat land   related to German Tenne  threshing floor   English den  cave   Sanskrit dh nu            desert    The  mark is believed to mean woodland or borderland  see marches   with probable references to the border forests in south Schleswig  11  Some of the earliest descriptions of the origin of the word  Denmark   describing a territory  are found in the Chronicon Lethrense  12th century   Svend Aagesen  late 12th century   Saxo Grammaticus  early 13th century  and the Ballad of Eric  mid 15th century   There are  however  many more Danish annuals and yearbooks containing various other details  similar tales in other variations  other names or spelling variations  The Jelling Stones  commonly referred to as Denmark s  birth certificate   seen from the north with  Gorm s Mound  in the background In Norse  the land was called Danm rk  12  The earliest mention of a territory called  Denmark  is found in King Alfred the Great s modified translation into Old English of Paulus Orosius  Seven Books of History Against The Pagans   Historiarum adversum Paganos Libri Septem    written by Alfred when king of Wessex in the years 871 899  In a passage introduced to the text by Alfred  we read about Ohthere of H logaland s travels in the Nordic region  during which  Denmark  Denamearc  was on his port side    And then for two days he had on his  port side  the islands which belong to Denmark   13  The first recorded use of the word  Denmark  within Denmark itself is found on the two Jelling stones  which are rune stones believed to have been erected by Gorm the Old  c  955  and Harald Bluetooth  c  965   The larger stone of the two is often cited as Denmark s birth certificate   d bsattest   trans babtismal certificate    though both use the word  Denmark   in the form of accusative           tanmaurk    danm rk   on the large stone  and genitive  tanmarkar   pronounced  danmarka    on the small stone  14  The inhabitants of Denmark are there called  tani    dan     or  Danes   in the accusative  In the Song of Roland  estimated to have been written between 1040 and 1115  the first mention of the legendary Danish hero Holger Danske appears  he is mentioned several times as  Ogier the Dane   Ogier de Denemarche    edit  History Main article  History of Denmark See also  History of Greenland and History of the Faroe Islands  edit  Prehistory The earliest archaeological findings in Denmark date back to the Eem interglacial period from 130 000 110 000 BC  15  Denmark has been inhabited since around 12 500 BC and agriculture has been evident since 3900 BC  16  The Nordic Bronze Age  1800 600 BC  in Denmark was marked by burial mounds  which left an abundance of findings including lurs and the Sun Chariot  During the Pre Roman Iron Age  500 BC    1 AD   native groups began migrating south  although 16  the first Danish people came to the country between the Pre Roman and the Germanic Iron Age  17  in the Roman Iron Age  1 400 AD   The Roman provinces maintained trade routes and relations with native tribes in Denmark  and Roman coins have been found in Denmark  Evidence of strong Celtic cultural influence dates from this period in Denmark and much of North West Europe and is among other things reflected in the finding of the Gundestrup cauldron  The gilded side of the Trundholm sun chariot Historians believe that before the arrival of the precursors to the Danes  who came from the east Danish islands  Zealand  and Sk ne and spoke an early form of North Germanic  most of Jutland and some islands were settled by Jutes  They were later invited to Great Britain as mercenaries by Brythonic King Vortigern and were granted the southeastern territories of Kent  the Isle of Wight among other areas  where they settled  They were later absorbed or ethnically cleansed by the invading Angles and Saxons  who formed the Anglo Saxons  The remaining population in Jutland assimilated in with the Danes  A short note 18  about the Dani in  Getica  by historian Jordanes is believed by some to be an early mention of the Danes  19  one of the ethnic groups from whom the modern Danish people are descended  The Danevirke defence structures were built in phases from the 3rd century forward  20  and the sheer size of the construction efforts in 737 are attributed to the emergence of a Danish king  20  The new runic alphabet was first used around the same time  and Ribe  the oldest town of Denmark  was founded about 700   edit  Viking Age Main article  Viking Age The Ladby ship  the largest ship burial found in Denmark From the 8th to the 10th century  the Danes were known as Vikings  Together with Norwegians and Swedes  they colonised  raided and traded in all parts of Europe  Viking explorers first discovered Iceland by accident in the 9th century  on the way towards the Faroe Islands and eventually came across  Vinland   Land of wine  also known today as Newfoundland  in Canada  The Danish Vikings were most active in British Isles and Western Europe  They temporarily conquered and settled parts of England  known as the Danelaw   Ireland  France and founded Normandy  More Anglo Saxon pence of this period have been found in Denmark than in England  As attested by the Jelling stones  the Danes were united and Christianised about 965 by Harald Bluetooth  It is believed that Denmark became Christian for political reasons so as not to get invaded by the rising Christian power in Europe  Germania  which was an important trading area for the Danes  In that case Harald built six fortresses around Denmark called Trelleborg and built a further Danevirke  In the early 11th century Canute the Great won and united Denmark  England and Norway for almost 30 years  21   edit  Medieval Denmark Throughout the High and Late Middle Ages  Denmark also included Sk neland  Sk ne  Halland and Blekinge  and Danish kings ruled Danish Estonia  as well as the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein  Most of the latter two now form part of northern Germany  In 1397  Denmark entered the Kalmar Union with Norway and Sweden  united under Queen Margaret I  The three countries were to be treated as equals in the union  However  even from the start Margaret may not have been so idealistic treating Denmark as the clear  senior  partner of the union  22  Thus  much of the next 125 years of Scandinavian history revolves around this union  with Sweden breaking off and being re conquered repeatedly  The issue was for practical purposes resolved on 17 June 1523  as Swedish King Gustav Vasa conquered the city of Stockholm  The Protestant Reformation came to Scandinavia in the 1530s  and following the Count s Feud civil war  Denmark converted to Lutheranism in 1536  Later that year  Denmark entered into a union with Norway   edit  Early modern history Battle of  land between an allied Dano Norwegian Dutch fleet and the Swedish navy  1 June 1676  After Sweden permanently broke away from the Kalmar Union in 1523  Denmark tried on two occasions to reassert control over Sweden  The first was in the Northern Seven Years War which lasted from 1563 until 1570  The second occasion was the Kalmar War when King Christian IV attacked Sweden in 1611 but failed to accomplish his main objective of forcing Sweden to return to the union with Denmark  The war led to no territorial changes  but Sweden was forced to pay a war indemnity of 1 million silver riksdaler to Denmark  an amount known as the  lvsborg ransom  23  King Christian used this money to found several towns and fortresses  most notably Gl ckstadt  founded as a rival to Hamburg   Christiania  following a fire destroying the original city of Oslo   Christianshavn  Christianstad and Christiansand  Christian also constructed a number of buildings  most notably B rsen  Rundet rn  Nyboder  Rosenborg  a silver mine and a copper mill  Inspired by the Dutch East India Company  he founded a similar Danish company and planned to claim Ceylon as a colony  but the company only managed to acquire Tranquebar on India s Coromandel Coast  Denmark s large colonial aspirations were limited to a few key trading posts in Africa and India  In the Thirty Years  War  Christian tried to become the leader of the Lutheran states in Germany but suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Lutter  24  The result was that the Catholic army under Albrecht von Wallenstein was able to invade  occupy and pillage Jutland  25  forcing Denmark to withdraw from the war  Denmark managed to avoid territorial concessions  but Gustavus Adolphus  intervention in Germany was seen as a sign that the military power of Sweden was on the rise while Denmark s influence in the region was declining  Swedish armies invaded Jutland in 1643 and claimed Sk ne in 1644  According to Geoffrey Parker   The Swedish occupation caused a drop in agricultural production and a shortage of capital  harvest failure and plague ravaged the land between 1647 and 1651  Denmark s population fell by 20 per cent   26  In the 1645 Treaty of Br msebro  Denmark surrendered Halland  Gotland  the last parts of Danish Estonia  and several provinces in Norway  In 1657  king Frederick III declared war on Sweden and marched on Bremen Verden  This led to a massive Danish defeat and the armies of King Charles X Gustav of Sweden conquered both Jutland  Funen and much of Zealand before signing the Peace of Roskilde in February 1658 which gave Sweden control of Sk ne  Blekinge  Tr ndelag and the island of Bornholm  Charles X Gustav quickly regretted not having destroyed Denmark completely and in August 1658 he began a two year long siege of Copenhagen but failed to take the capital  In the following peace settlement  Denmark managed to maintain its independence and regain control of Tr ndelag and Bornholm  Denmark tried to regain control of Sk ne in the Scanian War  1675 79  but this attempt was a failure  Following the Great Northern War  1700 21   Denmark managed to restore control of the parts of Schleswig and Holstein ruled by the house of Holstein Gottorp in 1721 and 1773  respectively  In the Napoleonic Wars  Denmark originally tried to pursue a policy of neutrality and trade with both France and the United Kingdom and joined the League of Armed Neutrality with Russia  Sweden and Prussia  The British considered this a hostile act and attacked Copenhagen in both 1801 and 1807  in one case carrying off the Danish fleet  in the other  burning large parts of the Danish capital  This led to the so called Danish British Gunboat War  but the British control of the waterways between Denmark and Norway proved disastrous to the union s economy and in 1813  Denmark Norway went bankrupt  The Danish Norwegian union was dissolved by the Treaty of Kiel in 1814  Norway entered a new union with Sweden which lasted until 1905  Denmark kept the colonies of Iceland  Faroe Islands and Greenland  Apart from the Nordic colonies  Denmark ruled over Danish India  Tranquebar in India  from 1620 to 1869  the Danish Gold Coast  Ghana  from 1658 to 1850  and the Danish West Indies  the U S  Virgin Islands  from 1671 to 1917   edit  Constitutional monarchy Den Grundlovsgivende Rigsforsamling  The founding fathers of the Danish constitution   1860 1864 painting by Constantin Hansen  The Danish liberal and national movement gained momentum in the 1830s  and after the European Revolutions of 1848 Denmark peacefully became a constitutional monarchy on 5 June 1849  After the Second War of Schleswig  Danish  Slesvig  in 1864  Denmark was forced to cede Schleswig and Holstein to Prussia  in a defeat that left deep marks on the Danish national identity  After these events  Denmark returned to its traditional policy of neutrality  Denmark became a member of the European Union in 1973 and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007  After the defeat of Germany in World War I  the Versailles powers offered to return the then German region of Schleswig Holstein to Denmark  Fearing German irredentism  Denmark refused to consider the return of the area and insisted on a plebiscite concerning the return of Schleswig  The two Schleswig Plebiscites took place on 10 February and 14 March  respectively  On 10 July 1920  after the plebiscite and the King s signature  9 July  on the reunion document  Northern Schleswig  S nderjylland  was recovered by Denmark  thereby adding 163 600 inhabitants and 3 984 km   The reunion day  Genforeningsdag  is celebrated every year 15 June on Valdemarsdag  Germany s invasion of Denmark on 9 April 1940    code named Operation Weser bung    met only two hours of military resistance before the Danish government surrendered  Economic co operation between Germany and Denmark continued until 1943  when the Danish government refused further co operation and its navy sank most of its ships and sent as many of their officers as they could to Sweden  During the war  the government was helpful towards the Danish Jewish minority  and the Danish resistance performed a rescue operation that managed to get most of them to Sweden and safety shortly before the Germans planned to round up the Danish Jews  Denmark led many  inside operations  or sabotage against the German facilities  Iceland severed ties to Denmark and became an independent republic  and in 1948  the Faroe Islands gained home rule  After the war  Denmark became one of the founding members of the United Nations and NATO  and in 1973  along with Britain and Ireland  joined the European Economic Community  now the European Union  after a public referendum  The Maastricht treaty was ratified after a further referendum in 1993 and the subsequent addition of concessions for Denmark under the Edinburgh Agreement  Greenland gained home rule in 1979 and was awarded self determination in 2009  Neither Greenland nor the Faroe Islands are members of the European Union  the Faroese declining membership in EEC from 1973 and Greenland from 1986  in both cases because of fisheries policies  Despite its modest size  Denmark has been participating in major UN sanctioned  and often NATO led  military and humanitarian operations notably including  Cyprus  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Korea  Egypt  Croatia  Kosovo  Ethiopia  Afghanistan  Iraq  Somalia and recently Libya  In 2009 Anders Fogh Rasmussen resigned as Prime Minister of Denmark to become the Secretary General of NATO   edit  Geography Main article  Geography of Denmark Copenhagen  the capital of Denmark Map of Denmark Denmark shares a border of 68 kilometres with Germany to the south and is otherwise surrounded by 7 314 kilometres of tidal shoreline  including small bays and inlets   It occupies 43 094 square kilometres  Since 2000 Denmark has been connected by the  resund Bridge to southern Sweden  Denmark s northernmost point is Skagens point  the north beach of the Skaw  at 57  45  7  northern latitude  the southernmost is Gedser point  the southern tip of Falster  at 54  33  35  northern latitude  the westernmost point is Bl vandshuk at 8  4  22  eastern longitude  and the easternmost point is  stersk r

Funen  The island of Bornholm is located east of the rest of the country  in the Baltic Sea  Many of the larger islands are connected by bridges  the  resund Bridge connects Zealand with Sweden  the Great Belt Bridge connects Funen with Zealand  and the Little Belt Bridge connects Jutland with Funen  Ferries or small aircraft connect to the smaller islands  The largest cities with populations over 100 000 are the capital Copenhagen on Zealand   rhus  Aalborg in Jutland  and Odense on Funen  The country is flat with little elevation  having an average height above sea level of 31 metres  102 ft   The highest natural point is M lleh j  at 170 86 metres  560 56 ft   The area of inland water is 700 km2  270 sq mi   Denmark s tidal shoreline is 7 314 km  4 545 mi   29  No location in Denmark is further from the coast than 52 km  32 mi   The size of the land area of Denmark cannot be stated exactly since the ocean constantly erodes and adds material to the coastline  and because of human land reclamation projects  to counter erosion   On the southwest coast of Jutland  the tide is between 1 and 2 m  3 28 and 6 56 ft   and the tideline moves outward and inward on a 10 km  6 2 mi  stretch  30  Phytogeographically  Denmark  including Greenland and the Faroe Islands  belongs to the Boreal Kingdom and is shared between the Arctic  Atlantic European and Central European provinces of the Circumboreal Region  According to the World Wide Fund for Nature  the territory of Denmark can be subdivided into two ecoregions  the Atlantic mixed forests and Baltic mixed forests  The Faroe Islands are covered by the Faroe Islands boreal grasslands  while Greenland hosts the ecoregions of Kalaallit Nunaat high arctic tundra and Kalaallit Nunaat low arctic tundra   edit  Climate Denmark

preservation  in 1971 Denmark established a Ministry of Environment and was the first country in the world to implement an environmental law in 1973  33  To mitigate environmental degradation and global warming the Danish Government has signed the following international agreements  Antarctic Treaty  Climate Change Kyoto Protocol  Endangered Species Act 1  Copenhagen is the spearhead of the bright green environmental movement in Denmark  In 2008  Copenhagen was mentioned by Clean Edge as one of the key cleantech clusters to watch in the book The Cleantech Revolution  34  The city is the focal point for more than half of Denmark s 700 cleantech companies and draws on some 46 research institutions  The cluster employs more than 60 000 people and is characterised by a close collaboration between universities  business and governing institutions  The capital s most important cleantech research institutions are the University of Copenhagen  Copenhagen Business School  35 Ris  DTU National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy and the Technical University of Denmark which Ris  is now part of  Leading up to the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference the University of Copenhagen held the Climate Change  Global Risks  Challenges and Decisions conference where the need for comprehensive action to mitigate climate change was stressed by the international scientific community  Notable figures such as Rajendra K  Pachauri  Chairman of the IPCC  Professor Nicholas Stern  author of the Stern Report and Professor Daniel Kammen all emphasised the good example set by Copenhagen and Denmark in capitalising on cleantech and achieving economic growth while stabilising carbon emissions  Denmark s green house gas emissions per dollar of value produced has been for the most part unstable since 1990  seeing sudden growths and falls  Overall though  there has been a reduction in gas emissions per dollar value added to its market  36  It lags behind other Scandinavian countries such as Norway 37  and Sweden  38   edit  Politics Main articles  Politics of Denmark and Government of Denmark Christiansborg Palace  where the Folketing and the courts meet  Queen Margrethe II of Denmark  The Kingdom of Denmark is a constitutional monarchy  The current and reigning monarch is Queen Margrethe II  As stipulated in the Danish Constitution  the monarch is not answerable for their actions  and their person is sacrosanct  39  The monarch formally appoints and dismisses the prime minister and other ministers  The prime minister is customarily chosen through negotiation between the parliament party leaders  The Folketing is the national legislature  In theory it has the ultimate legislative authority according to the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty  it is able to legislate on any matter and not bound by decisions of its predecessors  However questions over sovereignty have been brought forward because of Denmark s entry into the European Union  Parliament consists of 175 members elected by proportional majority  plus two members each from Greenland and the Faroe Islands  40  Parliamentary elections are held at least every four years  but it is within the powers of the prime minister to ask the monarch to call for an election before the term has elapsed  On a vote of no confidence  the parliament may force a single minister or the entire government to resign  41  The Danish political system has traditionally generated coalitions  Most Danish post war governments have been minority coalitions ruling with the support of non government parties  42  Prime Minister of Denmark  Helle Thorning Schmidt  Executive authority is exercised on behalf of the monarch by the prime minister and other cabinet ministers who head departments  The cabinet  prime minister and other ministers collectively make up the government  Legislative authority is vested in the executive and the legislature conjointly  although as noted the legislature remains supreme  Judicial authority lies with the courts of justice  43  Anders Fogh Rasmussen from the Venstre party  a center right liberal party was prime minister from November 2001 to April 2009  His government was a coalition consisting of Venstre and the Conservative People s Party  with parliamentary support from the national conservative Danish People s Party  Dansk Folkeparti   The three parties obtained a parliamentary majority in the 2001 election and maintained it virtually unchanged in the 2005 election  On 24 October 2007  an early election was called by the Prime Minister for 13 November  Following the election the Danish People s Party was strengthened while Anders Fogh Rasmussen s Venstre lost 6 seats and the Conservative People s Party retained the same number of seats in Parliament as prior to the election  The result ensured that Anders Fogh Rasmussen could continue as prime minister for a third term  With the parliamentary election held September 2011 the right wing  led by Lars L kke Rasmussen  lost by a small margin to the opposing coalition  led by Helle Thorning Schmidt who on 3 October 2011 formed a new government consisting of the Social Democratic Party  Danish Social Liberal Party and Socialist People s Party   edit  Foreign relations Main article  Foreign relations of Denmark Danish foreign policy is based on its identity as a sovereign nation in Europe  As such its primary foreign policy focus is on its relations with other nations as a sovereign independent nation  Denmark has long had good relations with other nations  It has been involved in coordinating Western assistance to the Baltic states  Estonia  44 Latvia  and Lithuania   45  The country is a strong supporter of international peacekeeping  Denmark is today pursuing an active foreign policy  where human rights  democracy and other crucial values are to be defended actively  In recent years Greenland and The Faroe Islands have been guaranteed a say in foreign policy issues such as fishing  whaling  and geopolitical concerns   edit  Military Main articles  Danish Defence and Military history of Denmark Group of Danish MP soldiers  HDMS Absalon  Denmark s armed forces are

of 98 municipalities  The regions were created on 1 January 2007 to replace the former counties  At the same time  smaller municipalities were merged into larger units  cutting the number of municipalities from 270 to 98  Most municipalities have a population of at least 20 000 people to give them financial and professional sustainability  although a few exceptions were made to this rule

investment has been made in building road and rail links between regions in Denmark  most notably the Great Belt Fixed Link  which connects Zealand and Funen  It is now possible to drive from Frederikshavn in northern Jutland to Copenhagen on eastern Zealand without leaving the motorway  The main railway operator is DSB for passenger services and DB Schenker Rail for freight trains  The railway tracks are maintained by Banedanmark  Copenhagen has a small Metro system  the Copenhagen Metro  and the greater Copenhagen area has an extensive electrified suburban railway network  the S

Line  to Norway   and FjordLine  to Norway   Private vehicles are increasingly used as a means of transport  Because of the high registration tax  180    VAT  25    and the world s highest income tax rate  new cars are very expensive  The purpose of the tax is to discourage car ownership  The car fleet has increased by 45  over the last 30 years  In 2007 an attempt was made by the government to favor environmentally friendly cars by slightly reducing taxes on high mileage vehicles  However  this has had little effect  and in 2008 Denmark experienced an increase in the import of fuel inefficient old cars  mostly older than 10 years   72  primarily from Germany  as the cost for older cars including taxes keeps them within the budget of many Danes  Bicycling in Denmark is a common form of transportation  particularly for the young and for city dwellers  With a network of bicycle routes extending more than 12 000 km 73  and an estimated 7 000 km 74  of segregated dedicated bicycle paths and lanes  Denmark has a solid bicycle infrastructure   edit  Public policy See also  Nordic model and Flexicurity After deregulating the labour market in the 1990s  Denmark has one of the most free labour markets in European countries  According to World Bank labour market rankings  the labour market flexibility is at the same levels as the United States  Around 80  of employees belong to unions and the unemployment funds that are attached to them  Labour market policies are mainly determined in negotiations between the workers  unions and employers  unions  and the government only interferes if labour strikes extend for too long  Despite the success of the trade unions  a growing number of people make contracts individually rather than collectively  and many  four out of ten employees  are contemplating dropping especially unemployment fund but occasionally even union membership altogether  The average employee receives a benefit at 47  of their wage level if they have to claim benefits when unemployed  With low unemployment  very few expect to be claiming benefits at all  The only reason then to pay the earmarked money to the unemployment fund would be to retire early and receive early retirement pay  efterl n   which is possible from the age of 60 provided an additional earmarked contribution is paid to the unemployment fund  75  The unemployment rate for December 2007 was 2 7   for a total of 74 900 persons  a reduction by 112 800 persons 2 400 per month or 60  since December 2003  76  The Eurostat unemployment number for August 2008 is 2 9   This has been achieved by employing more than 38   800 000 people  77  of the total workforce in public sector jobs  Another measure of the situation on the labour market is the employment rate  that is the percentage of people aged 15 to 64 in employment out of the total number of people aged 15 to 64  The employment rate for Denmark in 2007 was 77 1  according to Eurostat  Of all countries in the world  only Switzerland with 78   and Iceland with 85 1  had a higher employment rate  In December 2008  Statistics Denmark reported that 100 000 Danes were affected by unemployment in the third quarter of 2008  Of these  62  received a job within two months  and 6  had been unemployed for two years or more  The number of unemployed is forecast to be 65 000 in 2015  The number of people in the working age group  less disability pensioners etc   will grow by 10 000 to 2 860 000  and jobs by 70 000 to 2 790 000  78 part time jobs are included  79  Because of the present high demand and short supply of skilled labour  for instance for factory and service jobs  including hospital nurses and physicians  the annual average working hours have risen  especially compared with the recession 1987 1993  80  Increasingly  service workers of all kinds are in demand  i e  in the postal services and as bus drivers  and academics  81  In the fall of 2007  more than 250 000 foreigners are working in the country  of which 23 000 still reside in Germany or Sweden  82  According to a sampling survey of over 14 000 enterprises from December 2007 to April 2008 39 000 jobs were not filled  a number much lower than earlier surveys  confirming a downturn in the economic cycle  83  The level of unemployment benefits is dependent on former employment  the maximum benefit is at 90  of the wage  and at times also on membership of an unemployment fund  which is almost always but need not be administered by a trade union  and the previous payment of contributions  However  the largest share of the financing is still carried by the central government and is financed by general taxation  and only to a minor degree from earmarked contributions  There is no taxation  however  on proceeds gained from selling one s home  provided there was any home equity  da friv rdi    as the marginal tax rate on capital income from housing savings is around 0   84  The Danish welfare model is accompanied by a taxation system that is both broad based  25  VAT  not including excise  duty and tax  and with a progressive income tax model  meaning the more money that is earned  the higher income tax percentage that gets paid  minimum tax rate for adults is 42  scaling to over 60   except for the residents of Ertholmene that escape the otherwise ubiquitous 8  healthcare tax fraction of the income taxes 85  86    Other taxes include the registration tax on private vehicles  at a rate of 180   on top of VAT  Lately  July 2007  this has been changed slightly in an attempt to favor more fuel efficient cars but maintaining the average taxation level more or less unchanged  87   edit  Demographics Main articles  Demographics of Denmark and Languages of Denmark  r sk bing  a traditional

 Architecture of Denmark St Peter s Church in N stved  1375  Denmark s architecture became firmly established in the Middle Ages when first Romanesque  then Gothic churches and cathedrals sprang up throughout the country  From the 16th century  Dutch and Flemish designers were brought to Denmark  initially to improve the country s fortifications  but increasingly to build magnificent royal castles and palaces in the Renaissance style  During the 17th century  many impressive buildings were built in the Baroque style  both in the capital and the provinces  Neoclassicism from France was slowly adopted by native Danish architects who increasingly participated in defining architectural style  A productive period of Historicism ultimately merged into the 19th century National Romantic style  111  It was not  however  until the 1960s that Danish architects such as Arne Jacobsen entered the world scene with their highly successful Functionalism  This  in turn  has evolved into more recent world class masterpieces including J rn Utzon s Sydney Opera House and Johann Otto von Spreckelsen s Grande Arche de la D fense in Paris  paving the way for a number of contemporary Danish

nationalism and romanticism  Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg was not only a productive artist in his own right but taught at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts where his students included notable painters such as Wilhelm Bendz  Christen K bke  Martinus R rbye  Constantin Hansen  and Wilhelm Marstrand  The sculpture of Bertel Thorvaldsen was also significant during this period  114  In 1871
