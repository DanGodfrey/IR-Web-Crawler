most iconic and enduring heroes in the Marvel Universe  One of Spider Man s most prominent traits is his sense of humor  Even at the face of certain death  Spider Man invariably cracks a joke  to the annoyance of both friends and foes  Spider Man is also a loner  Due to his individualistic style  Spider Man finds it hard to work in teams  However  this has gradually lessened over the years  to the point Spider Man is a member of the Avengers  the New Avengers  and more recently  the Future Foundation  Spider Man s righteousness complimented Daredevil s maturity as a crime fighter during the Death of Jean DeWolf arc  leading to an enduring friendship  47  Peter also made close ties with the Fantastic Four at the very start of his career  which stands greater than ever today  like a family rendering aid to each other unconditionally   48  More recently Spider Man has bonded with the New Avengers of whom he is a founding member  trusting them so much that he d reveal his identity to each member  37  Of the two previously mentioned teams  Spidey is closest to the Human Torch and Wolverine  playing pranks on one another or seeking solace respectively  Reputation Seen by some as the heart of New York  Peter has gained quite a reputation with not only the superhero community  but villains and civilians as well  his Aunt May searched the Internet and found that Spider man had saved roughly 10 000 lives directly  excluding all of his team ups with other heroes and all the bombs or devices he s deactivated  49  In the Bar with No Name  the villains all initially felt discouraged to bet money against the wallcrawler as he fought Overdrive since  He always beats the new guys   50  When the Hood began his criminal career and was almost killed by the Constrictor  the Constrictor noted how new he was to villainy and that he  didn t even get to fight Spider Man    51  Despite all the grudges Spider Man has accumulated  he has made peace with some former enemies such as the Punisher  now an uneasy ally   and even checked up on the less than lethal Frog Man after his incarceration ended to make sure things were fine   52  In spite of his many heroics  Spider Man is infamous for numerous smear campaigns against him at the hands of the Daily Bugle  Powers and AbilitiesEdit Powers Spider Man possesses the proportionate powers of a spider  granted to him from an irradiated Common House Spider  Achaearanea tepidariorum  which bit Peter Parker that was apparently already mutated from prior exposure to certain frequencies of radiation and received a final  lethal dose during Parker s attendance of the exhibition  The radioactive  complex mutagenic enzymes in the spider s blood that were transferred at the time of the bite triggered numerous body wide mutagenic changes within Parker  granting him superhuman strength  speed  toughened flesh  and numerous arachnid like abilities  Like many superhuman powers  the effectiveness of Spider Man s abilities varies based on the author and the needs of the story  Wall Crawling Added by Moshikal15 Wall Crawling  Spider Man s exposure to the mutated spider venom induced a mutagenic  cerebellum wide alteration of his engrams resulting in the ability to mentally control the flux of inter atomic attraction  electrostatic force  between molecular boundary layers  This overcomes the outer electron shell s normal behavior of mutual repulsion with other outer electron shells and permits the tremendous potential for electron attraction to prevail  The mentally controlled sub atomic particle responsible for this has yet to be identified  This ability to affect the attraction between surfaces is so far limited to Spider Man s body  especially concentrated in his hands and feet  and another object  with an upper limit of several tons per finger  At one point  Spider man was able to prevent Anti Venom from taking his mask off by making it stick to his face  Limits to this ability seem to be psychosomatic  and the full nature of this ability has yet to be established  Superhuman Strength  Spider Man possesses superhuman strength enabling him to press lift approximately 10 tons  Spider Man s physical strength is sufficient to lift and throw objects as heavy such as a semi truck with ease  He must also pull his punches and kicks unless fighting someone of similar or greater physical durability  Otherwise  his blows would prove fatal to a normal human being  He has demonstrated that he strong enough enable him to knock out people with normal durability with as little as a tap to the head  Also during the Secret Invasion  Spider Man was shown to able to knock a Tyrannosaurus Rex into unconsciousness in one punch  Spider Man s physical strength also extends into his legs  enabling him to be able to jump to a height of several stories in a single bound  Spider Man demonstrated this when he leaped over 30 ft vertically into the air when he first leaped out of the way of an oncoming car  it should also be noted that when he first discovered his powers as a teenager  they hadn t developed to that of his prime  Superhuman Speed  Spider Man is capable of running and moving at speeds that are beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete  53  Spider Man has showed to be fast enough to catch up to an accelerating car while on foot  but prefers to travel by webs  54  Superhuman Stamina  Spider Man s advanced musculature produces less fatigue toxins during physical activity than an ordinary human  This allows him to exert himself physically for much longer periods of time before fatigue begins to impair him  At his peak  Spider Man can physically exert himself at his peak capacity for several hours before the build up of fatigue toxins in his blood begins to impair him  Several accounts depict Spider Man as able to hold his breath for eight minutes or more  Superhuman Durability  Spider Man s body is physically tougher and more resistant to some types of injury than the body of a normal human  His body is more resistant to impact forces than anything else  He can withstand great impacts  such as falling from a height of several stories or being struck by an opponent with super strength  that would severely injure or kill a normal human with little to no discomfort  Spider Man s body is durable to the point where tensing his super strong muscles while being punched in the torso by a trained heavyweight boxer caused the attacker s wrists to break  also  Spider Man has stated that he must roll with punches thrown by people without similar strength or durability to avoid breaking their wrists  Superhuman Agility  Spider Man s agility  balance  and bodily coordination are all enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete  Spider Man is extraordinarily limber and his tendons and connective tissues are twice as elastic as the average human being s  despite their enhanced strength  He has the combined agility and acrobatic prowess of the most accomplished circus aerialists and acrobats  He can also perform any complicated sequence of gymnastic stunts such as flips  rolls  and springs  He can easily match or top any Olympic record at gymnastics apparatus such as flying rings  climbing ropes  horizontal bars  trampolines  Superhuman Equilibrium  Spider Man possesses the ability to achieve a state of perfect equilibrium in any position imaginable  He seems able to adjust his position by instinct  which enables him to balance himself on virtually any object  no matter how small or narrow  Superhuman Reflexes  Spider Man s reflexes are similarly enhanced and are currently about 40 times greater than those of an ordinary human  In combination with his spider sense  the speed of his reflexes allows him to dodge almost any attack  or even gunfire  if he is far enough away  Spider Man has even been shown in some cases  to be able to dodge gunfire using just his reflexes without his Spider Sense  Regenerative Healing Factor  Spider Man has a limited healing factor  While not on Wolverine s level  it is sufficiently powerful enough to recover from severe injuries from broken bones and large amounts of tissue damage in a matter of days  After getting his powers  he soon found that his eyesight was repaired  discarding his glasses  During a battle with a villain called the Masked Marauder  Spider Man is rendered completely blind  however after about 2 days his sight was perfect  albeit sensitive for about a day after  Foreign Chemical Resistance  Due to his accelerated metabolism  Spider Man has a higher tolerance for drugs and diseases than normal humans  and he can recover from the effects of larger doses rapidly  During an encounter with the Swarm  Spider Man was incapacitated by thousands of bee stings  but recovered in less than 24 hours  His resistance and recovery time to other toxins and diseases varies  but is typically significantly higher than normal  Spider Man s unique physiology even allowed him to recover from the effects of vampirism  55  Spider Man was able to recover completely from acid being spat into his eyes by the new Vulture although the extent of the damage may have been restricted due to his superhuman durability  However  Spider Man has the normal human tolerance for alcoholic beverages  Spider Sense in action Added by Moshikal15 Spider Sense  Spider Man possesses an extrasensory  danger  or  spider  sense which warns him of potential immediate danger by the manifestation of a tingling sensation in the back of his skull  and links with his superhuman kinesthetics  enabling him to evade most any injuries  unless he cognitively overrides his automatic reflexes  The precise nature of this sense is unknown  It appears to be a simultaneous clairvoyant response to a wide variety of phenomena  everything from falling safes to speeding bullets to thrown punches   which has given several hundredths of a second warning  which is sufficient time for his reflexes to allow him to avoid injury  The sense also can create a general response on the order of several minutes  he cannot discern the nature of the threat by the sensation  He can  however  discern the severity of the danger by the strength of his response to it  Spider Man s spider sense is directional and can guide him to or away from hidden weapons and enemies Sudden and extreme threats can cause his spider sense to react with painful intensity  Spider Man can also sense and dodge attacks directed randomly or by an artificial intelligence  Using his spider sense to time his enhanced reflexes  Spider Man can casually dodge attacks up to and including automatic weapons fire  provided there is sufficient distance  His spider sense is sufficiently well linked to his reflexes to the point that a threat can trigger them even when Spider Man is asleep or stunned  His spider sense has helped him preserve his secret identity since it alerts him to observers or cameras when changing into or out of his costume  The spider sense does react to those who Peter does not consider to be a threat  such as Aunt May  Spider Man can choose to ignore his spider sense  and distraction or fatigue diminish its effectiveness  Spider Man s fighting style incorporates the advantage that his  spider sense  provides him  His body begins to produce more adrenaline after the sense is triggered  an extension of the  fight or flight syndrome   Even when he does not have the use of his eyes Spider Man can still use his Spider Sense in a similar fashion to Daredevil s Radar Sense to help him see by sensing the direction the danger is coming from by listening on the loudest noise around him  This was first used after Spider Man was temporarily blinded by a device 56  but was recently used again to help see the Vulture after his acidic breath blinded him  57 While he temporarily lost it during his battle with the Spider Slayers  it was restored during the Spider Island story line  Radio Frequency Detection  Peter s spider sense also enables him to track certain radio frequencies  which he has used to his advantage via his Spider Tracers  Former Powers Spider Man received several upgrades in recent years as a result of two different adventures  the first via the genetic manipulations of the Queen  and subsequently during the Other s evolution  These powers were later presumably removed following the One More Day saga  Queen s Mutation Following an encounter with an enemy known as the Queen  and her genetic manipulations of Peter s body  his Spider powers were augmented to varying degrees  Enhanced Superhuman Strength  Originally able to lift 10 tons he could now lift about 15 tons  Psychic Alignment with Arthropods  Peter s spider sense improved  creating a psychic alignment with his environment  specifically a more empathic and sympathetic relationship with spiders and insects  While connected to the varying populations of spiders he was unable to communicate with them directly or command them  In one instance  spiders voluntarily covered his unconscious body  concealing him from Shathra s predation  Biological Organic Webbing Generation  Spider Man was also gifted with the ability to organically produce his own silk webbing from glands within his forearms  limited by his body s health and nutrition  These organic webs had many of the same properties as Spider Man s artificial webbing  so he had no trouble utilizing them  though they required a week to decay rather than two hours  The silk was released through a spinneret near each wrist containing a central web spigot orifice used for web slinging and drag lines  supplemented by several radial minor spigots for other types of webs connected to specialized glands  The Other Evolution Main articles  The Other and  Changes to Peter Parker s Powers After a near death experience fighting Morlun  Spider Man s body underwent a metamorphosis that granted him greater power than ever before  having literally shed his skin  Enhanced Superhuman Strength  Spider Man s superhuman strength was enhanced as a result of his evolution by the Other  allowing him to lift up to 20 tons  Enhanced Superhuman Durability  Speed  Agility  and Reflexes  Spider Man s durability  speed  agility  and reflexes were all enhanced even further as a result of his evolution  allowing him to run fast enough to chase an automobile  perform even greater feats of agility  and react much quicker than even before  Psychological Awareness of Environment  Perhaps as an upgrade to his spider sense and his psychic alignment with arthropods  Spider Man received psychological awareness of his environment as a whole  allowing him to traverse across any environment without fear  Night Vision  Spider Man received enhanced night vision as a part of his evolution by the Other  allowing him to see in pitch black conditions  Vibration and Air Current Sense via Hair and webbing   Along with night vision  Spider Man gained superhuman sensitivity via touch  allowing the hairs on his body to sense air currents around him and vibrations via his webbing  Enhanced Regenerative Healing Factor Spider Man s healing factor was enhanced further by his evolution  Hibernation Healing  Only used once  Peter was able to come back from near death due to making a cocoon with his webbing  and hibernating with in it  He also shed his skin to heal  as most spiders due once in their life time  Stingers  Perhaps the most significant upgrade was the introduction of venomous stingers located beneath his wrists  Added by Sjtaylor65 Phoenix Force  In yet another one of Spider Man s transformations  he turned into Phoenix after she was apparently killed  Soon after he turned into Spider Phoenix  all of his deadliest foes began to attack him  It turned out that it was merely a sophisticated illusion created by Arcade  with technology he had won in a trade with a visiting off world soldier  58  Mindwipe after  Brand New Day   Although not technically a power  the worldwide mindwipe of Spider Man s identity as Peter Parker was part of Mephisto s deal to save Aunt May in  Brand New Day  and Dr  Strange s spell in  One Moment in Time   Spider Man is aware that the whole world has forgotten his secret identity  and describes it to Mister Fantastic as a  psychic blind spot   where any evidence which could lead to Spider Man being Peter Parker  people would not be able to connect the dots  or they would come up with the wrong solution  but would accept it as the right one regardless  Not only people s memory was affected  also every electronic and paper file was modified to have  inexplicable  gaps wherever any data useful to identifying him or his family members would otherwise be  If Spider Man was to unmask himself   or be unmasked  then any related people witnessing the incident  would have their memories returned  Mister Fantastic claims to be able to duplicate the  firewalls  for himself and the Fantastic Four  allowing Spider Man to safely tell them his identity without fear of compromising his secret  Due to the events of the Spider Island arc  while Spider Man s identity is still kept secret from the mindwipe  the effects of the psychic blindspot supplied by Dr  Strange has been weakened  making it possible for someone to correctly suspect that Peter Parker is Spider Man if they are able to which led Carlie Cooper to suspect this resulting in her breaking up with Peter  Power

1 Fighting Skills 6  Abilities Indomitable Will  Spider Man has a strong Force of Will  completely free of evil and temptation  For years  he has struggled to balance his life as a student and his superhero duties  He is able to emerge from defeat even stronger  His mental strength is also shown when he successfully wrestles control of nanobots from Doctor Octopus  Genius Intellect  Academically gifted  Peter displays an uncanny affinity for science  mathematics  mechanics  biology and physics  According to Parker his IQ is 250 60  Science Major  He is a brilliant individual  with exceptional skill in practically every field of science  and is an excellent inventor  61  He is an accomplished chemist and physicist  62  Skilled Photographer  Peter is a very skilled photographer  63   Master Acrobat  Thanks to his great strength and phenomenal equilibrium  Peter is an excellent athlete  excelling in all gymnastic fields and being able to perform every acrobatic stunt ever performed  including others that can never be performed by even an Olympic acrobat  Master Combatant  Thanks to Peter s amazing superhuman physiology  acrobatic powers and spider sense  he is an excellent hand to hand combatant using a fighting style derived from his spider like abilities  he made his own street style that could rival virtually any combatant out of sheer volatility to standard fighting techniques  eg webbing  wall crawling  super strength to lift heavy objects  etc   To compensate for the temporary loss of his spider sense  Peter took kung fu lessons from Shang Chi  Strength level Peter is capable of lifting approximately 10 tons  He was formerly able to lift 15 tons during the Queens mutation and then 20 tons during The Other event  prior to Mephisto and Dr Strange s alteration of reality Weaknesses Unlike many superheroes  Spider Man doesn t have a weakness he is automatically vulnerable to  but in recent years methods have been created to render him vulnerable  Spider Sense Disruption  Spider Man s Spider Sense can lose its effectiveness if it is blocked or temporarily weakened by specialized equipment or certain drugs  It also won t trigger if it detects something that isn t registered as a threat like the Spider Man clones or the Venom symbiote and its offspring and Anti Venom  When deprived of his spider sense  Spider Man becomes vulnerable to surveillance and attack  and web slinging requires most of his concentration  Anti Venom s Proximity  Anti Venom s failed attempt to cure Spider Man of his radioactive blood resulted in Spider Man s powers slowly canceling out whenever Anti Venom is too close to him  Also if Anti Venom binds him with his own webbing abilities it will also negate Spider Man s powers until Spider Man can get it off his body  This weakness no longer applies due to Eddie Brock sacrificing the Anti Venom Symbiote to cure the population of New York during the Spider Island story line  Ethyl Chloride  Perhaps as a side effect of gaining his powers  Spider Man is susceptible to the pesticide ethyl chloride  This chemical is frequently used as a weapon by the Spider Slayers  ParaphernaliaEdit Equipment Main article  Spider Man s Web Shooters Spider Man s Webs Added by Moshikal15 Spider Armor Mark II Added by ADour Unestable molecules costume Added by Peteparker Peter Parker s identi card Added by ADour Web Shooters  Parker s brilliance at physical science allowed him to create web shooters for use when he became Spider Man  64   The twin devices worn on his wrists are able to shoot thin strands of a special  web fluid  at high pressure  Web Fluid  A shear thinning liquid  virtually solid until a shearing force is applied to it  rendering it fluid  whose exact formula remains unknown  but is rumored to be related to nylon  The web line s tensile strength is estimated to be 120 pounds per square millimeter of cross section  Utility Belt  Spider Man keeps a utility belt holding web cartridges and his signature Spider Signal  Unestable molecules costume  A special outfit designed by Reed Richards for Spider Man s use as part of the Future Foundation  The costume is designed with third generation unstable molecules  allowing him to alter its styling by thought  permiting him to change his costume from the classic to the Future Foundation one  Beyond that  it still functions the same way the normal costumes do  Spider Armor MK II  Peter created version 2 0 of his Spider Armor to compensate for the loss of his Spider Sense  due without this ability he can be easily wounded by bullets  Horizon Labs identi car  As Horizon Labs creative engineer  Peter has his own indenti car  Former Equipment The Bombastic Bagman Added by Jyabura Spider Armor Mark I Added by Moshikal15 Iron Spider Costume Added by Deaedman Spence Spider Stealth Suit Added by ADour Spare Fantastic Costume  When Reed Richards first examined the alien symbiote and separated it from Peter  he was left without a costume and could not simply go web slinging undisguised as it could reveal his identity  At the mercy of the Human Torch  he was given a spare Fantastic Four costume and a paper bag as a mask  temporarily becoming what Johnny dubbed   The Bombastic Bagman   The suit itself was made of unstable molecules  insulated the wearer from electrical assaults and performed all other functions any of the Fantastic Four s own suits would  Spider Armor Mark I  In order to fight the New Enforcers  who were heavily armed  Peter developed a steel plated version of his costume  The  steel plates  were actually derived from a pseudo metallic composition that Peter created while in the laboratory of Empire State University  65  Unfortunately for Peter  it was destroyed by acid  and was never recreated or duplicated again  66  Iron Spider Armor  Tony Stark developed an armored suit for Spider Man in light of events  Supported by a system similar to that of Stark s classic Iron Man design  it featured many gadgets  It was used for the majority of the Superhero Civil War until Spider Man defected  going back to his classic red  amp  blue threads after the armor was destroyed in battle  Spidey Stealth Suit Created to combat the Hobgoblin s sonic Screams  the suit warps light and sound around him  rendering him invisible  Used by Spider Man s clone Kaine to defeat Spider Queen during Spider Island  After the events the costume was never returned to Peter  Transportation Spider Man s main form of transportation is  web slinging  with the aid of his spider webs  Spider Man was able to keep pace with Captain Marvel at his best speed  surprising the Kree warrior  although Spidey mentioned it was mostly due to his practice with web slinging over his career  67  Spider Mobile  no longer used   NotesEdit Spider Man has been parodied as the character Spider Ham in the Marvel Tales and What the    series  Spider Man is one of the few people to have become Captain Universe  chosen by the Uni Power  Although it was only for a short time  Cosmic Spider Man could manipulate his webbing into different shapes  generate energy blasts  fly and had all of his 5 senses superhumanly enhanced  Before he defeated the Tri Sentinel  he even managed to take on the likes of Magneto  Dr  Doom and Hulk  68  Spider Man is a possible Protestant  69  TriviaEdit After being attached to Ms  Marvel  Venom stated that she has feeling for Spider Man  Spider Man plays World of Warcraft and is Level 27  70  S H I E L D  managed to reverse engineer Spider Man s web
