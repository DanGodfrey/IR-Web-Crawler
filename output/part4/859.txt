Comics Productions 2011 Broadway Spider Man  Turn Off the Dark is a rock musical with music and lyrics by U2 s Bono and The Edge and a book by Julie Taymor  Glen Berger  and Roberto Aguirre Sacasa  The musical is based on the Spider Man comics created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko  published by Marvel Comics  as well as the 2002 film about the character and the Greek myth of Arachne  lt tells the story of the origin of the character  his romance with Mary Jane and his battles with the evil Green Goblin  The show includes highly technical stunts  such as actors swinging from  webs  and several aerial combat scenes  1  At the first preview performance  these technical challenges caused several lengthy interruptions  2  Several actors were injured during rehearsals and previews  Spider Man is

ground  that some commentators have asserted  have effectively distanced it from its peers and caused some confusion when it comes time to describe the show   7 The Edge stated that he is unsure of what description to use for the production  because  It is elements of rock and roll  it s elements of circus  it s elements of opera   and  of musical theater   7 Bono  admitting that his description is a little  pretentious   has referred to it as  pop up  pop art opera   noting that Julie Taymor is calling it a  rock and roll circus drama   7  8  Bono has also described the production as  wrestling with the same stuff  as  Rilke  Blake  Wings of Desire  Roy Lichtenstein   and  the Ramones   9  A 60 Minutes CBS special stated that it is being called a  comic book rock opera circus   although in that segment Bono noted that even using  rock  to describe the music is too narrow a description  because  We ve moved out of the rock and roll idiom in places into some very new territory for us      including  big show tunes and dance songs   10  The production was described early on as  the most technically complex show ever on Broadway  with 27 aerial sequences of characters flying  and engaging in aerial combat  1  The production not only features high flying stunts  but also includes a  multitude of moving set pieces that put the audience in the middle of the action   and enough projections onto giant screens that Bono has said that it is like a three dimensional graphic novel  7  The original story treated the origins of Spider Man similarly to the story in the 2002 film  but wove in an involved story about a villainness based on the mythological Arachne  A  geek chorus  of four teenagers narrated the story  In the rewritten version  the plot hews closer to the comic book and film and trims and transforms the role of Arachne into a  kindred spirit in Spider Man s dreams   11   edit  Broadway production Spider Man  Turn Off the Dark had no out of town tryouts because of the technical requirements of the production  which were designed for the Foxwoods Theatre on Broadway  12  The musical began previews on November 28  2010  with the official opening night

For full cast details see the cast lists page   edit  History  edit  Early development Andrew Lloyd Webber was one of several early critics of Spider Man  Turn Off the Dark  According to the New York Post  Bono began composing Spider Man after Andrew Lloyd Webber joked   I d like to thank rock musicians for leaving me alone for 25 years   I ve had the theater all to myself   Bono and Taymor  decided to give Andrew a little competition   20  In August 2002  Marvel announced that Tony Adams would produce a stage musical based on the Spider Man comics  28  Adams approached Bono and The Edge to be involved with the project  in turn  they enlisted Taymor to direct  29  However  in October 2005  Adams suffered a stroke while the creative team was assembled to sign contracts  he died two days later  28  Patrick Healy in The New York Times described their situation  Others might have abandoned the project  but the Spider Man team decided to go on  with Mr  Adams s partner  David Garfinkle  as lead producer  An able entertainment lawyer  Mr  Garfinkle had little producing experience  and he ceded artistic decisions to Ms  Taymor  a perfectionist whose aesthetic included never repeating herself  Mr  Garfinkle did not take the tack that Disney had while working with Ms  Taymor on their hit musical   The Lion King   her genius flourishes best under supervision  30   edit  Delays and budget overruns Readings of the musical were held beginning in 2007  31  but the production was delayed several times  32  By early 2009  the Broadway production ran  25 million into debt  the New York Post reported  and work on it was suspended  The budget for the project was reported in March 2009 to be a record setting  52 million  20  33  In late 2009  Bono asked Michael Cohl to step in as producer  and by May 2010 Cohl had raised the money to proceed with the project  much of it from Jeremiah J  Harris  former Chairman of Live Nation  who is also listed as a producer  34  Meanwhile  the musical was eventually scheduled to open at the Foxwoods Theatre on February 18  2010  but the production was delayed again until fundraising could be completed  35  By November 2010  the production was estimated to cost  65 million  34  In addition  the show s unusually high running costs were reported to be about  1 million per week  36  Meanwhile  a new opening night of December 21  2010 was scheduled  but this was delayed until January 2011  reportedly due to  a tremendous amount of creative commotion behind the scenes  as more time for rehearsals were needed  37  In December 2010  the official opening was again pushed back  to February 2011   to provide more time for the creators to stage a new final numbers  make further rewrites to the dialogue and consider adding and cutting scenes and perhaps inserting new music      Ms  Taymor and the producers have concluded that Act II has storytelling problems that need to be fixed   38  A  final postponement  was made once again  pushing the opening to March 15  2011  in order to  allow Taymor to fine tune the production and instate a new ending   4  The New York Times reported that the show s opening would be delayed for the sixth time  until summer 2011  This latest delay included a shutdown of previews  5  39  The shutdown lasted from April 19 to May 11  2011  in order for the new creative team to implement changes  preview performances resumed May 12  40  In March  Cohl and Harris said they shut down previews because they felt  the story needed some work  the songs needed some work  and the sound needed some work   and that they  were going to concentrate on those three areas over the next three and a half weeks   They also announced that injured Spider Man stunt performer Christopher Tierney would be rejoining the show  41  By April 2011 the capitalization was reported to have grown to  70 million  42  and as of the opening  it was reported as  75 million  3  compared to the typical  5 to  15 million for a Broadway musical  43   edit  Cast and creative team replacements   My GOD  that was a lucky escape  Jesus Christ  Talk about dodging a bullet there     Alan Cumming  on

of Labor reviewed these scenes in the show 58  and  in February 2011  cited the show for two workplace safety violations  The United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the show  12 600 in March 2011 for three serious safety violations  59  The Actors  Equity Association also looked into the incidents  58  One of the injuries occurred when Spider Man stunt double Kevin Aubin broke both wrists  60  Another actor  had broken  his  feet on the same move a month earlier   61  Natalie Mendoza  who was originally cast as Arachne  suffered a concussion during the first preview performance on November 28  2010  when she was struck in the head by equipment in the wings  She did not report the accident to producers until November 30  She appeared in the second performance

Press coverage and critical response The show s first performance  on November 28  2010   garnered what was most likely the most press coverage of a first preview in history   77  Reactions to the first preview described the musical as  visually stunning   despite technical glitches that resulted in several stops and starts during the performance  78  By January 18  2011  a reviewer reported that there were no delays during the preview he saw  He praised the stunts and ballads  that evoke the yearning grandeur of U2   though their more upbeat material tended to be nondescript  but felt that the  plot of the second act twisted into tangled knots   12  Radio and TV talkshow host Glenn Beck championed the production after attending the preview showings several times  79  Most of the major theater critics published their reviews of the first version on February 7  2011  nearly all of them were strongly negative in tone  80  81  Although reviews during the preview period are unusual  82  the critics decided that the ever expanding preview period was so long  and ticket prices were so high  that they should not wait for the official opening  83  An analysis in The New York Review of Books by classics scholar Daniel Mendelsohn followed up the complaints of other critics that Taymor s attempt to graft the classical myth of Arachne onto the comic book story turned the show into  a grotesque hybrid  and overloaded the plot with two unrelated main villains in Arachne and Green Goblin  84  In a scathing review of the first version  The New York Times critic Ben Brantley had said that Spider Man may  rank among the worst  Broadway musicals  85  In his review of the revised version  Brantley wrote   So is this ascent from jaw dropping badness to mere mediocrity a step upward  Well  until last weekend     I would have recommended Spider Man only to carrion feasting theater vultures  Now  if I knew a less than precocious child of 10 or so  and had several hundred dollars to throw away  I would consider taking him or her to the new and improved Spider Man   86  In the show s first incarnation  the average rating from critics was  F    while the revision garnered an average score of  C    In a roundup of the reviews  Linda Buchwald commented   critics actually miss some of Julie Taymor s ambition  crazy as they may have thought it at the time  Critics agree that the show is improved in that it makes much more sense  however  now they mostly find it a bore  Bono and the Edge s score is almost universally panned while Patrick Page s Green Goblin and stunning visuals remain for most critics the best reasons to see the show   87   edit  Box office Despite poor reviews and bad publicity  Spider Man has been very successful at the box office  55  Ticket sales the day after the first preview on November 28  2010  were more than one million dollars  88  During the first full week of 2011  Spider Man had the highest box office gross on Broadway  with a total of  1 588 514  89  The New York Times  Patrick Healy stated in February 2011 that Spider Man had become  a national object of pop culture fascination more so  perhaps  than any show in Broadway history  due to media coverage and late night comedians  monologues on the musical s many delays  injuries  and creative issues  He speculated that the musical would not have staying power through repeat viewings like other hit musicals  after  tourists and parents with children  watched it for  bragging rights at dinner parties or on the playground   55  The New York Post columnist Michael Riedel opined that month that the musical would be short lived   Depending on how much more money its backers are willing to lose  my hunch is that  Spider Man  will stagger through the spring  pick up with the tourist traffic in the summer and then collapse in the fall  It should be gone by September  2011    90  Spider Man survived beyond September 2011  with ticket sales improving during the summer  About half of its audience comes from beyond the New York metropolitan area  including many foreign tourists who speak little English  In November  its producers stated that the show earned about  100 000 to  300 000 in net income each week  which means that Spider Man will have to continue playing for at least five years to recoup the  75 million cost  The show may add new scenes and perhaps a new song each year to persuade fans to attend it again as  a whole new  comic book  issue   43  The first week of January 2012  the Broadway League reported that the show had taken in  2 941 790 in ticket sales the week before  the highest single week gross of any show in the history of Broadway  91   edit  In popular culture To offset some of the costs of the show  dozens of tie ins have been produced During the 2010 Tony Awards  host Sean Hayes ran on stage dressed as Spider Man  struggling comically to sing through the mask  92  After the first preview performance  Conan O Brien featured his own  preview  of the show  demonstrating how the show could have been more inexpensively produced  in ways that included using Silly String for web slinging stunts  93  The cover of the January 17  2011 The New Yorker featured a cartoon showing multiple actors dressed as Spider Man wearing casts or a head brace or in rehab  parodying the cast injuries in the show  94  The musical has been parodied several times on Saturday Night Live  On the December 4  2010 episode  Andy Samberg played an understudy playing Spider Man due to injuries  hanging upside down from the ceiling and failing to flip over  saying   You ll flip for it   The February 12  2011 episode had a commercial parody for a law firm called Gublin and Green specializing in lawsuits related to Turn Off the Dark  with a lawyer portrayed by Fred Armisen  While none of the defendants receive cash  they do receive free tickets to a future showing of the musical  One of the testimonials in the advertisement comes from Bono  as played by Andy Samberg  95  In the March 12  2011 episode  Taymor  who had just left the production  was satirized by Kristen Wiig  The May 23  2011 episode of the satirical animated series Mad involved Taymor approaching the Smallville TV series version of Clark Kent to cast him and the rest of the characters in Smallville  Turn Off The Clark  96  At the 2011 Tony Awards  host Neil Patrick Harris tried but failed to confine himself to as many jokes about Spider Man as he could complete in 30 seconds  focusing mainly on the accidents plaguing the show  97  On June 13  2011  Sesame Street posted a segment online parodying the musical  featuring Grover as the accident prone  SpiderMonster   98  The June 19  2011 episode of Law  amp  Order  Criminal Intent concerned a high flying Broadway musical named Icarus  where events similar to the events in the production history of Spider Man turn tragic  leading to an actor s death  In Icarus  the creative team includes a high
