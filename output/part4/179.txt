KRAYN  Ukrainian           transliterated  Ukrayina   ukr  jin    Russian            Crimean Tatar  Ukraina  is a country in Central and Eastern Europe  Ukraine borders the Russian Federation to the east and northeast  Belarus to the northwest  Poland  Slovakia and Hungary to the west  Romania and Moldova to the southwest  and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast  respectively  It has an area of 603 628 km   making it the second largest contiguous country on the European continent  after the Russian Federation  8  9  10  According to a popular and well established theory the medieval state of Kievan Rus was established by the Varangians in the 9th century as the first historically recorded East Slavic state which emerged as a powerful nation in the Middle Ages until it disintegrated in the 12th century  By the middle of the 14th century  Ukrainian territories were under the rule of three external powers the Golden Horde  the Grand Duchy of Lithuania  and the Kingdom of Poland  11  After the Great Northern War  1700 1721  Ukraine was divided between a number of regional powers and  by the 19th century  the largest part of Ukraine was integrated into the Russian Empire with the rest under Austro Hungarian control  A chaotic period of incessant warfare ensued  with several attempts at independence from 1917 to 1921  following World War I and the Russian Civil War  Ukraine emerged from this fighting on December 30  1922 as one of the founding republics of the Soviet Union  The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic s territory was enlarged westward shortly before and after World War II  and southwards in 1954 with the Crimea transfer  In 1945  the Ukrainian SSR became one of the founding members of the United Nations  12  Ukraine became independent again when the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991  This dissolution started a period of transition to a market economy  in which Ukraine was stricken with an eight year recession  13  Since then  however  the economy experienced a high increase in GDP growth  Ukraine was caught up in the worldwide economic crisis in 2008 and the economy plunged  GDP fell 20  from spring 2008 to spring 2009  then leveled off as analysts compared the magnitude of the downturn to the worst years of economic depression during the early 1990s  14  However  the country remains a globally important market and supplier  particularly  the world s third biggest grain exporter  as of 2011   15  Ukraine is a unitary state composed of 24 oblasts  provinces   one autonomous republic  Crimea   and two cities with special status  Kiev  its capital and largest city  and Sevastopol  which houses the Russian Black Sea Fleet under a leasing agreement  Ukraine is a republic under a semi presidential system with separate legislative  executive  and judicial branches  Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union  Ukraine continues to maintain the second largest military in Europe  after that of Russia  The country is home to 46 million people  77 8 percent of whom are ethnic Ukrainians  with sizable minorities of Russians  17    Belarusians and Romanians  The Ukrainian language is the official language in Ukraine  Russian is also widely spoken  The dominant religion in the country is Eastern Orthodox Christianity  which has heavily influenced Ukrainian architecture  literature and music  Contents 1

Recent  since 1991  11 3 Historical 12 External links Etymology Main article  Name of Ukraine The traditional view  mostly influenced by Russian and Polish historiography 16   on the etymology of Ukraine is that it came from the old Slavic term ukraina which meant  border region  or  frontier  17  and thus corresponded to the Western term march  The term can be often found in Eastern Slavic chronicles from 1187 on  but for a long time it referred not solely to the border lands in present day Ukraine  18  The plural term ukrainy was used as well in the Grand Duchy of Moscow as in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania  In the 16th and 17th centuries  particularly the lands across the border to the nomad world  Crimean Khanate  were described by this word  Frequent raids from the steppe made life in such regions a special and dangerous challenge  With the migration of the Great Abatis Belt southwards  the application of the term switched to Sloboda Ukraine and then to Central Ukraine where in the course of the time it obtained ethnic meaning for the local South Rus   Little Russia in the ecclesiastic 19  and the imperial Russian terminology   Many contemporary Ukrainian historians translate the term  u kraine  as  in land    home land  or  our country   20  This translation is in accordance with the original Ukrainian language meaning of preposition       u   and noun           krayina   21  The accompanying claim that it always had a strictly separate meaning to  borderland   ukraina vs  okraina  20  is considered inconsistent with a number of historical sources  often of not Ukrainian origin 18   while the translation as  borderland  agrees well with the traditional Russian language meaning of       u   and           kraina   22  Although some do not consider it to be appropriate  23  it is common practice to refer to Ukraine as  the Ukraine  in English  citation needed  History Main article  History of Ukraine Early history Human settlement in Ukraine and its vicinity dates back to 32 000 BCE  with evidence of the Gravettian culture in the Crimean Mountains  24  25  By 4 500 BCE  the Neolithic Cucuteni Trypillian Culture flourished in a wide area that included parts of modern Ukraine including Trypillia and the entire Dnieper Dniester region  During the Iron Age  the land was inhabited by Cimmerians  Scythians  and Sarmatians  26  Between 700 BC and 200 BC it was part of the Scythian Kingdom  or Scythia  The Zbruch idol  on display in the National Museum in Krak w Later  colonies of Ancient Greece  Ancient Rome  and the Byzantine Empire  such as Tyras  Olbia  and Hermonassa  were founded  beginning in the 6th century BC  on the northeastern shore of the Black Sea  and thrived well into the 6th century AD  The Goths stayed in the area but came under the sway of the Huns from the 370s AD  In the 7th century AD  the territory of eastern Ukraine was the center of Old Great Bulgaria  At the end of the century  the majority of Bulgar tribes migrated in different directions  and the Khazars took over much of the land  Golden Age of Kiev Main article  Kievan Rus  Map of the Kievan Rus  in the 11th century  During the Golden Age of Kiev  the lands of Rus  covered modern western  central and northern Ukraine  Belarus  and western Russia  Modern eastern and southern Ukraine were inhabited by nomads and had a different history  The Kievan Rus  were founded by the Rus  people  Varangians who first settled around Ladoga and Novgorod  then gradually moved southward eventually reaching Kiev about 880  The Kievan Rus  included the western part of modern Ukraine  Belarus  with larger part of it situated on the territory of modern Russia  According to the Primary Chronicle the Rus  elite initially consisted of Varangians from Scandinavia  The Baptism of Grand Prince Vladimir  led to the adoption of Christianity in Kievan Rus  During the 10th and 11th centuries  it became the largest and most powerful state in Europe  5  In the following centuries  it laid the foundation for the national identity of Ukrainians and Russians  27 Kiev  the capital of modern Ukraine  became the most important city of the Rus   The Varangians later became assimilated into the local Slavic population and became part of the Rus  first dynasty  the Rurik Dynasty  27  Kievan Rus  was composed of several principalities ruled by the interrelated Rurikid Princes  The seat of Kiev  the most prestigious and influential of all principalities  became the subject of many rivalries among Rurikids as the most valuable prize in their quest for power  The Golden Age of Kievan Rus  began with the reign of Vladimir the Great  980 1015   who turned Rus  toward Byzantine Christianity  During the reign of his son  Yaroslav the Wise  1019 1054   Kievan Rus  reached the zenith of its cultural development and military power  27  This was followed by the state s increasing fragmentation as the relative importance of regional powers rose again  After a final resurgence under the rule of Vladimir Monomakh  1113 1125  and his son Mstislav  1125 1132   Kievan Rus  finally disintegrated into separate principalities following Mstislav s death  In the 11th and 12th centuries  constant incursions by nomadic Turkic tribes  such as the Pechenegs and the Kipchaks  caused a massive migration of Slavic populations to the safer  heavily forested regions of the north  28  The 13th century Mongol invasion devastated Kievan Rus   Kiev was totally destroyed in 1240  29  On the Ukrainian territory  the state of Kievan Rus  was succeeded by the principalities of Halych and Volodymyr Volynskyi  which were merged into the state of Galicia Volhynia  Foreign domination See also  Grand Duchy of Lithuania  Crown of the Polish Kingdom  Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth  and Russian Empire In the centuries following the Mongol invasion  much of Ukraine was controlled by Lithuania  from the 14th century on  and since the Union of Lublin  1569  by Poland  as seen at this outline of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth as of 1619   Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks to Sultan Mehmed IV of the Ottoman Empire   Painted by Ilya Repin from 1880 to 1891  In the mid 14th century  Casimir III of Poland gained control of Galicia Volhynia  while the heartland of Rus   including Kiev  became the territory of the Gediminas  of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania  after the Battle on the Irpen  River  Following the 1386 Union of Krevo  a dynastic union between Poland and Lithuania  much of what became northern Ukraine was ruled by the increasingly Slavicised local Lithuanian nobles as part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania  By 1569  the Union of Lublin formed the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth  and a significant part of Ukrainian territory was moved from Lithuanian rule to the Polish Crown  thus becoming Polish territory  Under the cultural and political pressure of Polonisation  many upper class people of Polish Ruthenia  another term for the land of Rus  converted to Catholicism and became indistinguishable from the Polish nobility  30  Thus  the commoners  deprived of their native protectors among Rus nobility  turned for protection to the Cossacks  who remained fiercely Orthodox  The Cossacks tended to turn to violence against those they perceived as enemies  particularly the Polish state and its representatives  31  In the mid 17th century  a Cossack military quasi state  the Zaporozhian Host  was established by the Dnieper Cossacks and the Ruthenian peasants fleeing Polish serfdom  32  Poland had little real control of this land  yet they found the Cossacks to be a useful fighting force against the Turks and Tatars  33  and at times the two allied in military campaigns  34  However  the continued enserfment of peasantry by the Polish nobility  emphasized by the Commonwealth s fierce exploitation of the workforce  and most importantly  the suppression of the Orthodox Church pushed the allegiances of Cossacks away from Poland  33  The Khanate of Crimea was one of the strongest powers in Eastern Europe until the end of the 17th century  The Cossacks aspired to have representation in Polish Sejm  recognition of Orthodox traditions and the gradual expansion of the Cossack Registry  These were all vehemently rejected by the Polish nobility  who had power in the Sejm  The Cossacks eventually turned for protection to Orthodox Russia  a decision which would later lead towards the downfall of the Polish Lithuanian state  32  and the preservation of the Orthodox Church and in Ukraine  35  Bohdan Khmelnytsky   Hetman of Ukraine   establish an independent Ukraine after the uprising in 1648 against Poland  In 1648  Bohdan Khmelnytsky led the largest of the Cossack uprisings against the Commonwealth and the Polish king John II Casimir  starting a chain of events that led to Russia taking over Ukraine  36 Left bank Ukraine was eventually integrated into Muscovite Russia as the Cossack Hetmanate  following the 1654 Treaty of Pereyaslav and the ensuing Russo Polish War  After the partitions of Poland at the end of the 18th century by Prussia  Habsburg Austria  and Russia  Western Ukrainian Galicia was taken over by Austria  while the rest of Ukraine was progressively incorporated into the Russian Empire  The Crimean Khanate was one of the strongest powers in Eastern Europe until the 18th century  at one point it even succeeded  under the Crimean khan Devlet I Giray  to devastate Moscow  The Russian population of the borderlands suffered annual Tatar invasions and tens of thousands of soldiers were required to protect the southern boundaries  From the beginning of the 16th century until the end of 17th century the Crimean Tatar raider bands made almost annual forays into agricultural Slavic lands searching for captives to sell as slaves  37  According to Orest Subtelny      from 1450 to 1586  eighty six Tatar raids were recorded  and from 1600 to 1647  seventy   38  In 1688  Tatars captured a record number of 60 000 Ukrainians  39  This was a heavy burden for the state  and slowed its social and economic development  Since Crimean Tatars did not permit settlement of Russians to southern regions where the soil is better and the season is long enough  Muscovy had to depend on poorer regions and labour intensive agriculture  Poland Lithuania  Moldavia and Wallachia were also subjected to extensive slave raiding  The Crimean Khanate was conquered by the Russian Empire in 1778  bringing an end to what remained of Mongol and Tatar rule in Europe  The Ruin In 1657 1686 came  The Ruin   a devastating 30 year war amongst Russia  Poland  Turks and Cossacks for control of Ukraine  which occurred at about the same time as the Deluge of Poland  For three years  Khmelnytsky s armies controlled present day western and central Ukraine  but  deserted by his Tatar allies  he suffered a crushing defeat at Berestechko  and turned to the Russian Czar for help  The Battle of Poltava in 1709  as depicted by Denis Martens the Younger  1726 In 1654  Khmelnytsky signed the Treaty of Pereiaslav  forming a military and political alliance with Russia that acknowledged loyalty to the Czar  The wars escalated in intensity with hundreds of thousands of deaths  Defeat came in 1686 as the  Eternal Peace  between Russia and Poland gave Kiev and the Cossack lands east of the Dnieper over to Russian rule and the Ukrainian lands west of the Dnieper to Poland  In 1709 Cossack Hetman Ivan Mazepa  1687 1709  sided with Sweden against Russia in the Great Northern War  1700 1721   Mazepa  a member of the Cossack nobility  received an excellent education abroad and proved to be a brilliant political and military leader enjoying good relations with the Romanov dynasty  After Peter the Great became czar  Mazepa as hetman gave him more than twenty years of loyal military and diplomatic service and was well rewarded  Kirill Razumovsky  the last Hetman of left and right bank Ukraine 1750 1764  was  in May 1763  the first person to ever declare Ukraine to be a sovereign state Eventually Peter recognized that in order to consolidate and modernize Russia s political and economic power it was necessary to do away with the hetmanate and Ukrainian and Cossack aspirations to autonomy  Mazepa accepted Polish invitations to join the Poles and Swedes against Russia  The move was disastrous for the hetmanate  Ukrainian autonomy  and Mazepa  He died in exile after fleeing from the Battle of Poltava  1709   where the Swedes and their Cossack allies suffered a catastrophic defeat at the hands of Peter s Russian forces  The hetmanate was abolished in 1764  the Zaporizhska Sich abolished in 1775  as Russia centralized control over its lands  As part of the partitioning of Poland in 1772  1793  and 1795  the Ukrainian lands west of the Dnieper were divided between Russia and Austria  From 1737 to 1834  expansion into the northern Black Sea littoral and the eastern Danube valley was a cornerstone of Russian foreign policy  Lithuanians and Poles controlled vast estates in Ukraine  and were a law unto themselves  Judicial rulings from Cracow were routinely flouted  while peasants were heavily taxed and practically tied to the land as serfs  Occasionally the landowners battled each other using armies of Ukrainian peasants  The Poles and Lithuanians were Roman Catholics and tried with some success to convert the Orthodox lesser nobility  In 1596 they set up the  Greek Catholic  or Uniate Church  under the authority of the Pope but using Eastern rituals  it dominates western Ukraine to this day  Tensions between the Uniates and the Orthodox were never resolved  and the religious differentiation left the Ukrainian Orthodox peasants leaderless  as they were reluctant to follow the Ukrainian nobles  40  Cossacks led an uprising  called Koliivshchyna  starting in the Ukrainian borderlands of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1768  Ethnicity as one root cause of this revolt  which included Ukrainian violence that killed tens of thousands of Poles and Jews  Religious warfare also broke out between Ukrainian groups  Increasing conflict between Uniate and Orthodox parishes along the newly reinforced Polish Russian border on the Dnepr River in the time of Catherine II set the stage for the uprising  As Uniate religious practices had become more Latinized  Orthodoxy in this region drew even closer into dependence on the Russian Orthodox Church  Confessional tensions also reflected opposing Polish and Russian political allegiances  41  After the Russians annexed the Crimean Khanate in 1783  the region was settled by migrants from other parts of Ukraine  42  Despite the promises of Ukrainian autonomy given by the Treaty of Pereyaslav  the Ukrainian elite and the Cossacks never received the freedoms and the autonomy they were expecting from Imperial Russia  However  within the Empire  Ukrainians rose to the highest Russian state and church offices   a  At a later period  tsarists established a policy of Russification of Ukrainian lands  suppressing the use of the Ukrainian language in print  and in public  43  19th century  World War I and revolution Symon Petliura led Ukraine s struggle for independence following the Russian Revolution of 1917  he is now recognised as having been the third President of independent Ukraine Main article  Ukrainian War of Independence See also  Ukraine in World War I  Russian Civil War  and Ukraine after the Russian Revolution In the 19th century  Ukraine was a rural area largely ignored by Russia and Austria  With growing urbanization and modernization  and a cultural trend toward romantic nationalism  a Ukrainian intelligentsia committed to national rebirth and social justice emerged  The serf turned national poet Taras Shevchenko  1814 1861  and the political theorist Mykhailo Drahomanov  1841 1895  led the growing nationalist movement  After Ukraine and Crimea became aligned with the Russian Empire Russo Turkish War  1768 1774   significant German immigration German Russian Colonies occurred after it was encouraged by Catherine the Great and her immediate successors  Immigration was encouraged into Ukraine and especially the Crimea by Catherine in her proclamation of open migration to the Russian Empire  Immigration was encouraged for Germans and other Europeans to thin the previously dominant Turk population and encourage more complete use of farmland  Beginning in the 19th century  there was a continuous migration from Ukraine to settle the distant areas of the Russian Empire  According to the 1897 census  there were 223 000 ethnic Ukrainians in Siberia and 102 000 in Central Asia  44  Between 1896 and 1906  after the construction of the trans Siberian railway  a total of 1 6 million Ukrainians migrated eastward  45  Soldiers of the Ukrainian People s Army listening to a blind kobzar bandura player Nationalist and socialist parties developed in the late 19th century  Austrian Galicia  which enjoyed substantial political freedom under the relatively lenient rule of the Habsburgs  became the center of the nationalist movement  Ukrainians entered World War I on the side of both the Central Powers  under Austria  and the Triple Entente  under Russia  3 5 million Ukrainians fought with the Imperial Russian Army  while 250 000 fought for the Austro Hungarian Army  46  During the war  Austro Hungarian authorities established the Ukrainian Legion to fight against the Russian Empire  This legion was the foundation of the Ukrainian Galician Army that fought against the Bolsheviks and Poles in the post World War I period  1919 23   Those suspected of Russophile sentiments in Austria were treated harshly  Up to 5 000 supporters of the Russian Empire from Galicia were detained and placed in Austrian internment camps in Talerhof  Styria  and in a fortress at Terez n  now in the Czech Republic   47  When World War I ended  several empires collapsed  among them were the Russian and Austrian empires  The Russian Revolution of 1917 ensued  and a Ukrainian national movement for self determination reemerged  with heavy Communist Socialist influence  During 1917 20  several separate Ukrainian states briefly emerged  the Ukrainian People s Republic  the Hetmanate  the Directorate and the pro Bolshevik Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic  or Soviet Ukraine  successively established territories in the former Russian Empire  while the West Ukrainian People s Republic and the Hutsul Republic emerged briefly in the former Austro Hungarian territory  This led to civil war  and an anarchist movement called the Black Army led by Nestor Makhno developed in Southern Ukraine during that war  48  However  Poland defeated Western Ukraine in the Polish Ukrainian War  but failed against the Bolsheviks in an offensive against Kiev  According to the Peace of Riga concluded between the Soviets and Poland  western Ukraine was officially incorporated into Poland  who in turn recognised the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in March 1919  Ukraine became a founding member of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or the Soviet Union in December 1922  49  Inter war Polish Ukraine The war in Ukraine continued for another two years  by 1921  however  most of Ukraine had been taken over by the Soviet Union  while Galicia and Volhynia were incorporated into independent Poland  A powerful underground Ukrainian nationalist movement rose in Poland in the 1920s and 1930s  led by the Ukrainian Military Organization and the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists  OUN   The movement attracted a militant following among students and harassed the Polish authorities  Legal Ukrainian parties  the Ukrainian Catholic Church  an active press  and a business sector also flourished in Poland  Economic conditions improved in the 1920s  but the region suffered from the Great Depression in the 1930s  Inter war Soviet Ukraine Soviet recruitment poster featuring the Ukrainisation theme  The text reads   Son  Enroll in the school of Red commanders  and the defence of Soviet Ukraine will be ensured   The civil war that eventually brought the Soviet government to power devastated Ukraine  It left over 1 5 million people dead and hundreds of thousands homeless  In addition  Soviet Ukraine had to face the famine of 1921  50  Seeing an exhausted Ukraine  the Soviet government remained very flexible during the 1920s  51  Thus  under the aegis of the Ukrainization policy pursued by the national Communist leadership of Mykola Skrypnyk  Soviet leadership encouraged a national renaissance in literature and the arts  The Ukrainian culture and language enjoyed a revival  as Ukrainisation became a local implementation of the Soviet wide policy of Korenisation  literally indigenisation  policy  49  The Bolsheviks were also committed to introducing universal health care  education and social security benefits  as well as the right to work and housing  52 Women s rights were greatly increased through new laws designed to wipe away centuries old inequalities  53  Most of these policies were sharply reversed by the early 1930s after Joseph Stalin gradually consolidated power to become the de facto communist party leader  Two future leaders of the Soviet Union  Nikita Khrushchev  pre war CPSU chief in Ukraine  and Leonid Brezhnev  an engineer from Dniprodzerzhynsk  depicted together The communists gave a privileged position to manual labor  the largest class in the cities  where Russians dominated  The typical worker was more attached to class identity than to ethnicity  Although there were incidents of ethnic friction among workers  in addition to Ukrainians and Russians there were significant numbers of Poles  Germans  Jews  and others in the Ukrainian workforce   industrial laborers had already adopted Russian culture and language to a significant extent  Workers whose ethnicity was Ukrainian were not attracted to campaigns of Ukrainianization or de Russification in meaningful numbers  but remained loyal members of the Soviet working class  There was no significant antagonism between workers identifying themselves as Ukrainian or Russian  Starting from the late 1920s  Ukraine was involved in the Soviet industrialisation and the republic s industrial output quadrupled during the 1930s  49  The industrialisation had a heavy cost for the peasantry  demographically a backbone of the Ukrainian nation  To satisfy the state s need for increased food supplies and to finance industrialisation  Stalin instituted a program of collectivisation of agriculture as the state combined the peasants  lands and animals into collective farms and enforced the policies by the regular troops and secret police  49  Those who resisted were arrested and deported and the increased production quotas were placed on the peasantry  The collectivisation had a devastating effect on agricultural productivity  As the members of the collective farms were not allowed to receive any grain until sometimes unrealistic quotas were met  starvation in the Soviet Union became more common  In 1932 33  millions starved to death in a famine known as Holodomor or  Great Famine   c  Scholars are divided as to whether this famine fits the definition of genocide  but the Ukrainian parliament and other countries recognise it as such  c  DniproHES hydroelectric power plant under construction circa 1930 The famine claimed up to 10 million of Ukrainian lives as peasants  food stocks were forcibly removed by the Soviet government by the NKVD secret police  Some explanations for the causes for the excess deaths in rural areas of Ukraine and Kazakhstan during 1931 34 has been given by dividing the causes into three groups  objective non policy related factors  like the drought of 1931 and poor weather in 1932  inadvertent result of policies with other objectives  like rapid industrialization  socialization of livestock  and neglected crop rotation patterns  and deaths caused intentionally by a starvation policy  The Communist leadership perceived famine not as a humanitarian catastrophe but as a means of class struggle and used starvation as a punishment tool to force peasants into collective farms  54  It was largely the same groups of individuals who were responsible for the mass killing operations during the civil war  collectivisation  and the Great Terror  These groups were associated with Efim Georgievich Evdokimov  1891 1939  and operated in Ukraine during the civil war  in the North Caucasus in the 1920s  and in the Secret Operational Division within General State Political Administration  OGPU  in 1929 31  Evdokimov transferred into Communist Party administration in 1934  when he became Party secretary for North Caucasus Krai  But he appears to have continued advising Joseph Stalin and Nikolai Yezhov on security matters  and the latter relied on Evdokimov s former colleagues to carry out the mass killing operations that are known as the Great Terror in 1937 38  55  With Joseph Stalin s change of course in the late 1920s  however  Moscow s toleration of Ukrainian national identity came to an end  Systematic state terror of the 1930s destroyed Ukraine s writers  artists  and intellectuals  the Communist Party of Ukraine was purged of its  nationalist deviationists   Two waves of Stalinist political repression and persecution in the Soviet Union  1929 34 and 1936 38  resulted in the killing of some 681 692 people  this included four fifths of the Ukrainian cultural elite and three quarters of all the Red Army s higher ranking officers  49  b  World War II See also  Eastern Front  World War II  Kiev suffered significant damage during World War II  and was occupied by Nazi Germany from 19 September 1941 until 6 November 1943 Following the Invasion of Poland in September 1939  German and Soviet troops divided the territory of Poland  Thus  Eastern Galicia and Volhynia with their Ukrainian population became reunited with the rest of Ukraine  The unification that Ukraine achieved for the first time in its history was a decisive event in the history of the nation  56  57  In 1940  Romania ceded Bessarabia and northern Bukovina in response to Soviet demands  The Ukrainian SSR incorporated northern and southern districts of Bessarabia  northern Bukovina  and the Hertsa region  But it ceded the western part of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic to the newly created Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic  All these territorial gains were internationally recognised by the Paris peace treaties of 1947

a  Hero City   because the resistance by the Red Army and by the local population was fierce  More than 600 000 Soviet soldiers  or one quarter of the Western Front  were killed or taken captive there  58  59  Although the wide majority of Ukrainians fought alongside the Red Army and Soviet resistance  60  some elements of the Ukrainian nationalist underground created an anti Soviet nationalist formation in Galicia  the Ukrainian Insurgent Army  1942  that at times engaged the Nazi forces and continued to fight the USSR in the years after the war  Using guerilla war tactics  the insurgents targeted for assassination and terror those who they perceived as representing  or cooperating at any level with  the Soviet state  61  62  Museum of the Great Patriotic War  Kiev At the same time another nationalist movement fought alongside the Nazis  In total  the number of ethnic Ukrainians that fought in the ranks of the Soviet Army is estimated from 4 5 million 60  to 7 million  63  d  The pro Soviet partisan guerilla resistance in Ukraine is estimated to number at 47 800 from the start of occupation to 500 000 at its peak in 1944  with about 50 percent of them being ethnic Ukrainians  64  Generally  the Ukrainian Insurgent Army s figures are very undependable  ranging anywhere from 15 000 to as much as 100 000 fighters  65  66  Initially  the Germans were even hailed as liberators by some western Ukrainians  who had only joined the Soviet Union in 1939  However  brutal German rule in the occupied territories eventually turned its supporters against the occupation  Nazi administrators of conquered Soviet territories made little attempt to exploit the population of Ukrainian territories  dissatisfaction with Stalinist political and economic policies  67  Instead  the Nazis preserved the collective farm system  systematically carried out genocidal policies against Jews  deported others to work in Germany  and began a systematic depopulation of Ukraine  along with Poland  to prepare it for German colonisation  67  which included a food blockade on Kiev  68  The vast majority of the fighting in World War II took place on the Eastern Front  69  It has been estimated that 93 percent of all Nazi casualties took place on the Eastern Front  70  The total losses inflicted upon the Ukrainian population during the war are estimated between five and eight million  71  72  including over half a million Jews killed by the Einsatzgruppen  sometimes with the help of local collaborators  Of the estimated 8 7 million Soviet troops who fell in battle against the Nazis  73  74  75  1 4 million were ethnic Ukrainians  73  75  d  e  So to this day  Victory Day is celebrated as one of ten Ukrainian national holidays  76  Post World War II See also  Ukrainian

destroyed  77  The situation was worsened by a famine in 1946 47  which was caused by a drought and the wartime infrastructure destruction  This famine took away tens of thousands of lives  78  In 1945  the Ukrainian SSR became one of the founding members of the United Nations organization  12  First Soviet computer MESM was built in Kiev Institute of Electrotechnology and became operational in

comprising 20  of the total  Apart from Ukrainians  over 450 000 ethnic Germans from Ukraine and more than 200 000 Crimean Tatars were victims of forced deportations  79  Following the death of Stalin in 1953  Nikita Khrushchev became the new leader of the USSR  Being the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukrainian SSR in 1938 49  Khrushchev was intimately familiar with the republic and after taking power union wide  he began to emphasize the friendship between the Ukrainian and Russian nations  In 1954  the 300th anniversary of the Treaty of Pereyaslav was widely celebrated  and in particular  Crimea was transferred from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR  80  Central Kharkiv during the late Soviet era  circa 1980  Already by 1950  the republic fully surpassed pre war levels of industry and production  81  During the 1946 1950 five year plan nearly 20 percent of the Soviet budget was invested in Soviet Ukraine  a five percent increase from prewar plans  As a result the Ukrainian workforce rose 33 2 percent from 1940 to 1955 while industrial output grew 2 2 times in that same period  Soviet Ukraine soon became a European leader in industrial production  82  It also became an important center of the Soviet arms industry and high tech research  Such an important role resulted in a major influence of the local elite  Many members of the Soviet leadership came from Ukraine  most notably Leonid Brezhnev  who would later oust Khrushchev and become the Soviet leader from 1964 to 1982  as well as many prominent Soviet sports players  scientists and artists  On April 26  1986  a reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant exploded  resulting in the Chernobyl disaster  the worst nuclear reactor accident in history  83  This was the only accident to receive the highest possible rating of 7 by the International Nuclear Event Scale indicating a  major accident   until the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster that occurred in March 2011  84  At the time of the accident seven million people lived in the contaminated territories  including 2 2 million in Ukraine  85  After the accident  a new city  Slavutych  was built outside the exclusion zone to house and support the employees of the plant which was decommissioned in 2000  A report prepared by the International Atomic Energy Agency and World Health Organization attributed 56 direct deaths to the accident and estimated that there may have been 4 000 extra cancer deaths  86  Independence The first launch of a Ukrainian rocket at the Sea Launch complex On July 16  1990  the new parliament adopted the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine  87  The declaration established the principles of the self determination of the Ukrainian nation  its democracy  political and economic independence  and the priority of Ukrainian law on the Ukrainian territory over Soviet law  A month earlier  a similar declaration was adopted by the parliament of the Russian SFSR  This started a period of confrontation between the central Soviet  and new republican authorities  In August 1991  a conservative faction among the Communist leaders of the Soviet Union attempted a coup to remove Mikhail Gorbachev and to restore the Communist party s power  After the attempt failed  on August 24  1991 the Ukrainian parliament adopted the Act of Independence in which the parliament declared Ukraine as an independent democratic state  88  A referendum and the first presidential elections took place on December 1  1991  That day  more than 90 percent of the Ukrainian people expressed their support for the Act of Independence  and they elected the chairman of the parliament  Leonid Kravchuk to serve as the first President of the country  At the meeting in Brest  Belarus on December 8  followed by Alma Ata meeting on December 21  the leaders of Belarus  Russia  and Ukraine  formally dissolved the Soviet Union and formed the Commonwealth of Independent States  CIS   89  Although the idea of an independent Ukrainian nation had previously not existed in the 20th century in the minds of international policy makers  90  Ukraine was initially viewed as a republic with favorable economic conditions in comparison to the other regions of the Soviet Union  91  However  the country experienced deeper economic slowdown than some of the other former Soviet Republics  During the recession  Ukraine lost 60 percent of its GDP from 1991 to 1999  92  93  and suffered five digit inflation rates  94  Dissatisfied with the economic conditions  as well as the amounts of crime and corruption  Ukrainians protested and organised strikes  95  The Ukrainian economy stabilized by the end of the 1990s  A new currency  the hryvnia  was introduced in 1996  Since 2000  the country has enjoyed steady real economic growth averaging about seven percent annually  13  96  A new Constitution of Ukraine was adopted under second President Leonid Kuchma in 1996  which turned Ukraine into a semi presidential republic and established a stable political system  Kuchma was  however  criticized by opponents for corruption  electoral fraud  discouraging free speech and concentrating too much power in his office  97  He also repeatedly transferred public property into the hands of loyal oligarchs  Protesters at Independence Square on the first day of the Orange Revolution In 2004  Viktor Yanukovych  then Prime Minister  was declared the winner of the presidential elections  which had been largely rigged  as the Supreme Court of Ukraine later ruled  98  The results caused a public outcry in support of the opposition candidate  Viktor Yushchenko  who challenged the outcome of the elections  This resulted in the peaceful Orange Revolution  bringing Viktor Yushchenko and Yulia Tymoshenko to power  while casting Viktor Yanukovych in opposition  99  Yanukovych returned to a position of power in 2006  when he became Prime Minister in the Alliance of National Unity  100  until snap elections in September 2007 made Tymoshenko Prime Minister again  101  Yanukovych was elected President in 2010  102  Conflicts with Russia over the price of natural gas briefly stopped all gas

territories since its initial foundation  Most of these territories have been located within Eastern Europe  however  as depicted in the maps in the gallery below  has also at times extended well into Eurasia and South Eastern Europe  At times there has also been a distinct lack of a Ukrainian state  as its territories were on a number of occasions  annexed by its more powerful neighbours

Black Sea coast at sunset The Ai Petri s peak is located 1200 m above mean sea level At 603 700 square kilometres  233 100 sq mi  and with a coastline of 2 782 kilometres  1 729 mi   Ukraine is the world s 44th largest country  after the Central African Republic  before Madagascar   It is the largest wholly European country and the second largest country in Europe  after the European part of Russia  before metropolitan France   i  5  It lies between latitudes 44  and 53  N  and longitudes 22  and 41  E  The Ukrainian landscape consists mostly of fertile plains  or steppes  and plateaus  crossed by rivers such as the Dnieper  Dnipro   Seversky Donets  Dniester and the Southern Buh as they flow south into the Black Sea and the smaller Sea of Azov  To the southwest  the delta of the Danube forms the border with Romania  Its various regions have diverse geographic features ranging from the highlands to the lowlands  The country s only mountains are the Carpathian Mountains in the west  of which the highest is the Hora Hoverla at 2 061 metres  6 762 ft   and the Crimean Mountains on the Crimean peninsula  in the extreme south along the coast  105  However Ukraine also has a number of highland regions such as the Volyn Podillia Upland  in the west  and the Near Dnipro Upland  on the right bank of Dnieper   to the east there are the south western spurs of the Central Russian Uplands over which runs the border with Russia  Near the Sea of Azov can be found the Donets Ridge and the Near Azov Upland  The snow melt from the mountains feeds the rivers  and natural changes in altitude form a sudden drop in elevation and create many opportunities to form waterfalls of Ukraine  Significant natural resources in Ukraine include iron ore  coal  manganese  natural gas  oil  salt  sulfur  graphite  titanium  magnesium  kaolin  nickel  mercury  timber and an abundance of arable land  Despite this  the country faces a number of major environmental issues such as inadequate supplies of potable water  air and water pollution and deforestation  as well as radiation contamination in the north east from the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant  Recycling toxic household waste is still in its infancy in Ukraine  106  Typical agricultural landscape of Ukraine  Kherson Oblast Great White Pelicans are native to south western Ukraine Regionalism There are not only clear regional differences on questions of identity but historical cleavages remain evident at the level of individual social identification  Attitudes toward the most important political issue  relations with Russia  differed strongly between Lviv  identifying more with Ukrainian nationalism and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church  and Donetsk  predominantly Russian orientated and favorable to the Soviet era  while in central and southern Ukraine  as well as Kiev  such divisions were less important and there was less antipathy toward people from other regions  a poll by the Research  amp  Branding Group held March 2010 showed that the attitude of the citizens of Donetsk to the citizens of Lviv was 79  positive and that the attitude of the citizens of Lviv to the citizens of Donetsk was 88  positive 107    However  all were united by an overarching Ukrainian identity based on shared economic difficulties  showing that other attitudes are determined more by culture and politics than by demographic differences  107  108  Surveys of regional identities in Ukraine have shown that the feeling of belonging to a  Soviet identity  is strongest in the Donbas  about 40   and the Crimea  about 30    109  Biodiversity Ukraine is home to a very wide range of animals  fungi  micro organisms and plants  Animals The speckled ground squirrel is a native of the east Ukrainian steppes Lake Synevir is the largest lake in the Ukrainian Carpathians Ukraine is divided into two main zoological areas  One of these areas  in the west of the country  is made up of the borderlands of Europe  where there are species typical of mixed forests  the other is located in eastern Ukraine  where steppe dwelling species thrive  In the forested areas of the country it is not uncommon to find lynxes  wolves  wild boar and martens  as well as many other similar species  this is especially true of the Carpathian mountains  where a large number of predatory mammals make their home  as well as a contingent of brown bears  Around Ukraine s lakes and rivers beavers  otters and mink make their home  whilst within  carp  bream and catfish are the most commonly found species of fish  In the central and eastern parts of the country  rodents such as hamsters and gophers are found in large numbers  Fungi More than 6600 species of fungi  including lichen forming species  have been recorded from Ukraine   110  111  but this number is far from complete  The true total number of fungal species occurring in Ukraine  including species not yet recorded  is likely to be far higher  given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7  of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered  112  Although the amount of available information is still very small  a first effort has been made to estimate the number of fungal species endemic to Ukraine  and 2217 such species have been tentatively identified  113  Climate Ukraine has a mostly temperate continental climate  although a more Mediterranean climate is found on the southern Crimean coast  Precipitation is disproportionately distributed  it is highest in the west and north and lowest in the east and southeast  Western Ukraine receives around 1 200 millimetres  47 2 in  of precipitation annually  while Crimea receives around 400 millimetres  15 7 in   Winters vary from cool along the Black Sea to cold farther inland  Average annual temperatures range from 5 5  C  41 9  F  7  C  44 6  F  in the north  to 11  C  51 8  F  13  C  55 4  F  in the south  114  Politics In the modern era Ukraine has become a much more democratic country 115  116  117  118  Main articles  Politics of Ukraine  Government of Ukraine  and Elections in Ukraine Ukraine is a republic under a mixed semi parliamentary semi presidential system with separate legislative  executive  and judicial branches  The Constitution of Ukraine Main article  Constitution of Ukraine After Ukraine proclaimed its independence  on August 24  1991  and adopted its constitution on June 28  1996  Ukraine became a presidential parliamentary republic  But on Dec  8  2004  at the request of  political forces of Prime Minister Yanukovich   who feared that Yushchenko would come to power   deputies introduced radical changes to the Constitution  402 deputies voted  including the Party of Regions  the Communist Party  and the Socialist Party   Since those changes  Ukraine has had a parliamentary presidential republic  From 2004 to 2010  the legitimacy of the 2004 Constitution had official sanction  both with the Constitutional Court 119  of Ukraine  and with opposition leader Viktor Yanukovych  who has repeatedly spoken out against the alleged intentions of President Yushchenko  to repeal the provisions of the Constitution of 2004    However  when Yanukovych became President  he appointed new Constitutional Court justices  and on 30 September 2010 the Constitutional Court decided to abolish the 2004 Constitution and return to the 1996 Constitution  thus making Ukraine s political system more presidential in character   However  such a cancellation of the 2004 Constitution has raised doubts among the public  Part of the concern has been due to the fact that neither the Constitution of 1996 nor the Constitution of 2004 provides the ability to  undo the Constitution   as the decision of the Constitutional Court would have it  even though the 2004 constitution arguably has an exhaustive list of possible procedures for constitutional amendments  articles 154 159   In any case  the current Constitution can arguably be modified only by a vote in Parliament  119  120  121  The President  Parliament and the Government of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych  the president of Ukraine since 2010 The President is elected by popular vote for a five year term and is the formal head of state  122  Verkhovna Rada  the Parliament of Ukraine Ukraine s legislative branch includes the 450 seat unicameral parliament  the Verkhovna Rada  123  The parliament is primarily responsible for the formation of the executive branch and the Cabinet of Ministers  which is headed by the Prime Minister  124  However  the President still retains the authority to nominate the Ministers of the Foreign Affairs and of Defence for parliamentary approval  as well as the power to appoint the Prosecutor General and the head of the Security Service  Laws  acts of the parliament and the cabinet  presidential decrees  and acts of the Crimean parliament may be abrogated by the Constitutional Court  should they be found to violate the Constitution of Ukraine  Other normative acts are subject to judicial review  The Supreme Court is the main body in the system of courts of general jurisdiction  Local self government is officially guaranteed  Local councils and city mayors are popularly elected and exercise control over local budgets  The heads of regional and district administrations are appointed by the President in accordance with the proposals of the Prime Minister  This system virtually requires an agreement between the President and the Prime Minister  and has in the past led to problems  such as when President Yushchenko used a legally controversial ways to evade the law by appointing no actual governors or the local leaders  but so called  temporarily acting  officers  thus evading the need to seek a compromise with the Prime Minister  This practice was very controversial and required review by the Constitutional Court  Ukraine has a large number of political parties  many of which have tiny memberships and are unknown to the general public  Small parties often join in multi party coalitions  electoral blocs  for the purpose of participating in parliamentary elections  Courts and law enforcement Main articles  Judicial system of Ukraine and Law enforcement in Ukraine The courts enjoy legal  financial and constitutional freedom guaranteed by measures adopted in Ukrainian law in 2002  Judges are largely well protected from dismissal  except in the instance of gross misconduct   Court justices are appointed by presidential decree for an initial period of five years  after which Ukraine s Supreme Council confirms their positions for life in an attempt to insulate them from politics  Although there are still problems with the performance of the system  it is considered to have been much improved since Ukraine s independence in 1991  The Supreme Court is regarded as being an independent and impartial body  and has on several occasions ruled against the Ukrainian government  Justices of Ukraine s Constitutional Court Prosecutors in Ukraine have greater powers than in most European countries  and according to the European Commission for Democracy through Law  the role and functions of the Prosecutor s Office is not in accordance with Council of Europe standards   125  In addition to this  from 2005 until 2008 the criminal judicial system maintained a 99 5 percent conviction rate  equal to the conviction rate of the Soviet Union  with 126  suspects often being incarcerated for long periods before trial  127  On March 24  2010 President Viktor Yanukovych formed an expert group to make recommendations how to  clean up the current mess and adopt a law on court organization   127  One day after setting this commission Yanukovych stated  We can no longer disgrace our country with such a court system   127  Judicial and penal institutions play a fundamental role in protecting citizens and safeguarding the common good  The criminal judicial system and the prison system of Ukraine remain quite punitive  In contemporary Ukraine prison ministry of chaplains does not exist de jure  A uniformed officer of the Highways  Police    I  Since January 1  2010 it is allowed to hold court proceedings in Russian on mutual consent of parties  Citizens  who are unable to speak Ukrainian or Russian are allowed to use their native language or the services of a translator  128  Previously all court proceedings were required to be held in Ukrainian  which is the nation s only language with any truly official administrative status  Law enforcement agencies in Ukraine are typically organised under the authority of the Ministry of Internal Affairs  They consist primarily of the national police force   i i i   and various specialised units and agencies such as the State Border Guard and the Coast Guard services  In recent years the law enforcement agencies  particularly the police  have faced criticism for their heavy handling of the 2004 Orange Revolution  this criticism stems from the use by President Kuchma government s contemplated use of Berkut special operations units and internal troops in a plan to put an end to demonstrations on Kiev s Maidan Nezalezhnosti  The actions of the government saw many thousands of police officers mobilised and stationed throughout the capital  primarily to dissuade protesters from challenging the state s authority but also to provide a quick reaction force in case of need  most officers were armed and another 10 000 were held in reserve nearby  129  Bloodshed was only avoided when Lt  Gen  Sergei Popkov heeded his colleagues  calls to withdraw  The Ministry of Internal Affairs is also responsible for the maintenance of the State Security Service  Ukraine s domestic intelligence agency  which has on occasion been accused of acting like a secret police force serving to protect the country s political elite from media criticism  On the other hand however  it is widely accepted that members of the service provided vital information about government plans to the leaders of the Orange Revolution in order to prevent the collapse of the movement  Foreign relations Main articles  Foreign

balances its relationship with the European Union and the United States with strong ties to Russia  The European Union s Partnership and Cooperation Agreement  PCA  with Ukraine went into force on March 1  1998  The European Union  EU  has encouraged Ukraine to implement the PCA fully before discussions begin on an association agreement  The EU Common Strategy toward Ukraine  issued at the EU Summit in December 1999 in Helsinki  recognizes Ukraine s long term aspirations but does not discuss association  On January 31  1992  Ukraine joined the then Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  now the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  OSCE   and on March 10  1992  it became a member of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council  Ukraine also has a close relationship with NATO and had previously declared interest in eventual membership  this however was removed from the government s foreign policy agenda  upon election of Viktor Yanukovych to the presidency  in 2010  It is the most active member of the Partnership for Peace  PfP   All major political parties in Ukraine support full eventual integration into the European Union  The Association Agreement with the EU is expected to be signed into effect by the end of 2011  although recent political developments have cast some doubt on this issue  Ukraine maintains peaceful and constructive relations with all its neighbours  it has especially close ties with Russia and Poland  although relations with the former are complicated by energy dependence and payment arrears  Administrative divisions Main articles  Administrative divisions of Ukraine and Ukrainian historical regions The system of Ukrainian subdivisions reflects the country s status as a unitary state  as stated in the country s constitution  with unified legal and administrative regimes for each unit  Ukraine is subdivided into twenty four oblasts  provinces  and one autonomous republic  avtonomna respublika   Crimea  Additionally  the cities of Kiev  the capital  and Sevastopol  both have a special legal status  The 24 oblasts and Crimea are subdivided into 490 raions  districts   or second level administrative units  The average area of a Ukrainian raion is 1 200 square kilometres  460 sq mi   the average population of a raion is 52 000 people  130  Urban areas  cities  can either be subordinated to the state  as in the case of Kiev and Sevastopol   the oblast or raion administrations  depending on their population and socio economic importance  Lower administrative units include urban type

largest nuclear weapons arsenal in the world  131  132  In May 1992  Ukraine signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty  START  in which the country agreed to give up all nuclear weapons to Russia for disposal and to join the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty as a non nuclear weapon state  Ukraine ratified the treaty in 1994  and by 1996 the country became free of nuclear weapons  131  Ukraine took consistent steps toward reduction of conventional weapons  It signed the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe  which called for reduction of tanks  artillery  and armoured vehicles  army forces were reduced to 300 000   The country plans to convert the current conscript based military into a professional volunteer military not later than in 2011  133  Ukrainian Air Force Sukhoi Su 27

The country has had a limited military partnership with Russia  other CIS countries and a partnership with NATO since 1994  In the 2000s  the government was leaning towards the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  and a deeper cooperation with the alliance was set by the NATO Ukraine Action Plan signed in 2002  It was later agreed that the question of joining NATO should be answered by a national

Economy Main article  Economy of Ukraine In Soviet times  the economy of Ukraine was the second largest in the Soviet Union  being an important industrial and agricultural component of the country s planned economy  5  With the dissolution of the Soviet system  the country moved from a planned economy to a market economy  The transition process was difficult for the majority of the population which plunged into poverty  140  Ukraine s economy contracted severely following the years after the Soviet dissolution  Day to day life for the average person living in Ukraine was a struggle  A significant number of citizens in rural Ukraine survived by growing their own food  often working two or more jobs and buying the basic necessities through the barter economy  141  In 1991  the government liberalized most prices to combat widespread product shortages  and was successful in overcoming the problem  At the same time  the government continued to subsidize state run industries and agriculture by uncovered monetary emission  The loose monetary policies of the early 1990s pushed inflation to hyperinflationary levels  For the year 1993  Ukraine holds the world record for inflation in one calendar year  142  Those living on fixed incomes suffered the most  49  The building of the National Bank of Ukraine Prices stabilized only after the introduction of new currency  the hryvnia  in 1996  The country was also slow in implementing structural reforms  Following independence  the government formed a legal framework for privatization  However  widespread resistance to

Direct Investment in Ukraine has remained relatively strong ever since recession of the early 1990s  the country has had trouble maintaining stable economic growth  Issues relating to current corporate governance in Ukraine are primarily linked to the large scale monopolisation of traditional heavy industries by wealthy individuals such as Rinat Akhmetov  the enduring failure to broaden

Ukraine is one of Europe s largest energy consumers  it consumes almost double the energy of Germany  per unit of GDP  166  A great share of energy supply in Ukraine comes from nuclear power  with the country receiving most of its nuclear fuel from Russia  The remaining oil and gas  is also imported from the former Soviet Union  Ukraine is heavily dependent on its nuclear power  The largest nuclear power plant in Europe  the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant  is located in Ukraine  In 2006  the government planned to build 11 new reactors by the year 2030  in effect  almost doubling the current amount of nuclear power capacity  167  Ukraine s power sector is the twelfth largest in the world in terms of installed capacity  with 54 gigawatts  GW   166  In 2007 47 4  of power came from coal and gas  approx 20  gas   47 5  from nuclear  92 5 TWh  and 5  from hydro  167  Currently the country has four active nuclear power stations  located in Kuznetsovsk  Enerhodar  Yuzhnoukrainsk and Netishyn  In addition to these active plants  a fifth reactor complex had been planned for the Crimea  but construction was suspended indefinitely in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster  a major nuclear incident which took place at the Chernobyl Atomic Energy Station  110 km north of Kiev  All of Ukraine s RBMK reactors  the type involved in the Chernobyl disaster   were located at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant  All of the reactors there have been shutdown leaving only VVER reactors operating in the country  which are much safer than RBMK units  Three of these new type reactors were built since 1991 in the independent Ukraine  with the first one in 1995   whilst the other sixteen were inherited from the Soviet Union  The share of renewables within the total energy mix is still very small  but is growing fast  Total installed capacity of renewable energy installations more than doubled in 2011 and now stands at 397 MW  168  Indeed  2011 was a breakthrough year for renewable energy development in Ukraine  especially for solar energy  First  Okhotnykovo Solar Park  one of the world s largest  was put into operation in July  Then  just six months later  Europe s largest solar park was completed in Perovo   Crimea   169  Ukrainian State Agency for Energy Efficiency and Conservation forecasts that combined installed capacity of wind and solar power plants in Ukraine could increase by another 600 MW in 2012  170  The Economic Bank for Reconstruction and Development estimates that Ukraine has great renewable energy potential  the technical potential for wind energy is estimated at 40 TWh year  small hydro at 8 3 TWh year  biomass at 120 TWh year  and solar energy at 50 TWh year  171  Transportation Main articles  Transport in Ukraine and Ukrainian Railways Rail transport is heavily utilised in Ukraine Most of the Ukrainian road system has not been upgraded since the Soviet era  and is now outdated  The Ukrainian government has pledged to build some 4 500 km

international airport is located  Rail transport in Ukraine plays the role of connecting all major urban areas  port facilities and industrial centers with neighbouring countries  The heaviest concentration of railroad track is located in the Donbas region of Ukraine  Although the amount of freight transported by rail fell by 7 4 percent in 1995 in comparison with 1994  Ukraine is still one of the world s highest rail users  173  The total amount of railroad track in Ukraine extends for 22 473 kilometres  13 964 mi   of which 9 250 kilometres  5 750 mi  is electrified  5  Currently the

Ukrainians in Ukraine  2001  Ukraine has been in a demographic crisis since the 1980s because of its high death rate and a low birth rate  The population is shrinking by over 150 000 a year  The birth rate has recovered in recent years from a catastrophically low level around 2000  and is now comparable to the European average  but would need to increase by another 50  or so to stabilize the population  citation needed  In 2007  the country s population was declining at the fourth fastest rate in the world  180  Life expectancy is falling  The nation suffers a high mortality rate from environmental pollution  poor diets  widespread smoking  extensive alcoholism  and deteriorating medical care  181  182  In the years 2008 through 2010  more than 1 5 million children were born in Ukraine  compared to fewer than 1 2 million during 1999 2001 during the worst of the demographic crisis  Infant mortality rates have also dropped from 10 4 deaths to 8 9 per 1 000 children under one year of age  This is still high in comparison  however  to many other nations  183  According to the United Nations poverty and poor health care are the two biggest problems Ukrainian children face  More than 26 percent of families with one child  42 percent of families with two children and 77 percent of families with four and more children live in poverty  according to United Nations International Children s Emergency Fund  183  In November 2009 Ukrainian human rights ombudsman Nina Karpacheva stated that the lives of many of Ukraine s 8 2 million children remain tough  183  Fertility and natalist policies Population of Ukraine  in millions  from 1950 to 2009  184  185  The current birth rate in Ukraine  as of 2010  is 10 8 births 1 000 population  and the death rate is 15 2 deaths 1 000 population  see demographic tables  The phenomenon of lowest low fertility  defined as total fertility below 1 3  is emerging throughout Europe and is attributed by many to postponement of the initiation of childbearing  Ukraine  where total fertility  a very low 1 1 in 2001   was one of the world s lowest  shows that there is more than one pathway to lowest low fertility  Although Ukraine has undergone immense political and economic transformations during 1991 2004  it has maintained a young age at first birth and nearly universal childbearing  Analysis of official national statistics and the Ukrainian Reproductive Health Survey show that fertility declined to very low levels without a transition to a later pattern of childbearing  Findings from focus group interviews suggest explanations of the early fertility pattern  These findings include the persistence of traditional norms for childbearing and the roles of men and women  concerns about medical complications and infertility at a later age  and the link between early fertility and early marriage  186  To help mitigate the declining population  the government continues to increase child support payments  Thus it provides one time payments of 12 250 Hryvnias for the first child  25 000 Hryvnias for the second and 50 000 Hryvnias for the third and fourth  along with monthly payments of 154 Hryvnias per child  147  187  The demographic trend is showing signs of improvement  as the birth rate has been steadily growing since 2001  188  Net population growth over the first nine months of 2007 was registered in five provinces of the country  out of 24   and population shrinkage was showing signs of stabilising nationwide  In 2007 the highest birth rates were in the Western Oblasts  189  In 2008  Ukraine emerged from lowest low fertility  and the upward trend has continued since then  except for a slight dip in 2010 due to the economic crisis of 2009  see

1926 were in Odessa  154 000 or 36 5  of the total population  and Kiev  140 500 or 27 3   200  The 2001 census indicated that there are 103 600 Jews in Ukraine  although community leaders claimed that the population could be as large as 300 000  There are no statistics on what share of the Ukrainian Jews are observant  but Orthodox Judaism has the strongest presence in Ukraine  Smaller Reform and Conservative Jewish  Masorti  communities exist as well  195  Famines and migration The famines of the 1930s  followed by the devastation of World War II  comprised a demographic disaster  Life expectancy at birth fell to a level as low as ten years for females and seven for males in 1933 and plateaued around 25 for females and 15 for males in the period 1941 44  201  According to The Oxford companion to World War II   Over 7 million inhabitants of Ukraine  more than one sixth of the pre war population  were killed during the Second World War   202  Significant migration took place in the first years of Ukrainian independence  More than one million people moved into Ukraine in 1991 2  mostly from the other former Soviet republics  In total  between 1991 and 2004  2 2 million immigrated to Ukraine  among them  2 million came from the other former Soviet Union states   and 2 5 million emigrated from Ukraine  among them  1 9 million moved to other former Soviet Union republics   203  Currently  immigrants constitute an estimated 14 7   of the total population  or 6 9 million people  this is the fourth largest figure in the world  204  In 2006  there were an estimated 1 2 million Canadians of Ukrainian ancestry  205  giving Canada the world s third largest Ukrainian population behind Ukraine itself and Russia  Health Main article  Health in Ukraine Building of the state administered district hospital in Hlukhiv  Northern Ukraine Ukraine s healthcare system is state subsidised and freely available to all Ukrainian citizens and registered residents  However  it is not compulsory to be treated in a state run hospital as a number of private medical complexes do exist nationwide  206  The public sector employs most healthcare professionals  with those working for private medical centres typically also retaining their state employment as they are mandated to provide care at public health facilities on a regular basis  All the country s medical service providers and hospitals are subordinate to the Ministry of Health  which provides oversight and scrutiny of general medical practice as well as being responsible for the day to day administration of the healthcare system  Despite this standards of hygiene and patient care have fallen  207  Population pyramid of Ukraine in 2012 from International Futures Hospitals in Ukraine are organised along the same lines as most European nations  according to the regional administrative structure  resultantly most towns have their own hospital                  and many also have district hospitals                    Larger and more specialised medical complexes tend only to be found in major cities  with some even more specialised units located only in the capital  Kiev  However  all Oblasts have their own network of general hospitals which are able to deal with almost all medical problems and are typically equipped with major trauma centres  such hospitals are called  regional hospitals                     Ukraine currently faces a number of major public health issues  and is considered to be in a demographic crisis due to its high death rate and low birth rate  the current Ukrainian birth rate is 11 births 1 000 population  and the death rate is 16 3 deaths 1 000 population   A factor contributing to the relatively high death is a high mortality rate among working age males from preventable causes such as alcohol poisoning and smoking  182  In 2008  the country s population was one of the fastest declining in the world at  5  growth  180  208  The UN warned that Ukraine s population could fall by as much as 10 million by 2050 if trends did not improve  209  In addition to this obesity  systemic high blood pressure and the HIV endemic are all major challenges facing the contemporary Ukrainian healthcare system  As of March 2009 the Ukrainian government to reforming the health care system  by the creation of a national network of family doctors and improvements in the

largest number of post secondary graduates in Europe  while being ranked seventh in population  The first higher education institutions  HEIs  emerged in Ukraine during the late 16th and early 17th centuries  The first Ukrainian higher education institution was the Ostrozka School  or Ostrozkiy Greek Slavic Latin Collegium  similar to Western European higher education institutions of the time  Established in 1576 in the town of Ostrog  the Collegium was the first higher education institution in the Eastern Slavic territories  The oldest university was the Kyiv Mohyla Academy  first established in 1632 and in 1694 officially recognized by the government of Imperial Russia as a higher education institution  Among the oldest is also the Lviv University  founded in 1661  More higher education institutions were set up in the 19th century  beginning with universities in Kharkiv  1805   Kiev  1834   Odessa  1865   and Chernivtsi  1875  and a number of professional higher education institutions  e g   Nizhyn Historical and Philological Institute  originally established as the Gymnasium of Higher Sciences in 1805   a Veterinary Institute  1873  and a Technological Institute  1885  in Kharkiv  a Polytechnic Institute in Kiev  1898  and a Higher Mining School  1899  in Katerynoslav  Rapid growth followed in the Soviet period  By 1988 a number of higher education institutions increased to 146 with over 850 000 students  214  Most HEIs established after 1990 are those owned by private organizations  The National Mining University in Dnipropetrovsk  one of Ukraine s oldest professional technical universities  The Ukrainian higher education system comprises higher educational establishments  scientific and methodological facilities under federal  municipal and self governing bodies in charge of education  215  The organisation of higher education in Ukraine is built up in accordance with the structure of education of the world s higher developed countries  as is defined by UNESCO and the UN  216  Nowadays higher education is either state funded or private  Students that study at state expense receive a standard scholarship if their average marks at the end of term exams and differentiated test is at least 4  see the 5 point grade system below   this rule may be different in some universities  In the case of all grades being the highest  5   the scholarship is increased by 25   For most students the level of government subsidy is not sufficient to cover their basic living expenses  Most universities provide subsidized housing for out of city students  Also  it is common for libraries to supply required books for all registered students  There are two degrees conferred by Ukrainian universities  the Bachelor s Degree  4 years  and the Master s Degree  5 6th year   These degrees are introduced in accordance with Bologna process  in which Ukraine is taking part  Historically  Specialist s Degree  usually 5 years  is still also granted  it was the only degree awarded by universities in the Soviet times  Culture See also  Ukrainian culture A collection of traditional pysanky from Volyn St  Michael s Golden Domed Cathedral in Kiev  an example

play a greater role in raising children than in the West  217  The culture of Ukraine has been also influenced by its eastern and western neighbours  which is reflected in its architecture  music and art  The Communist era had quite a strong effect on the art and writing of Ukraine  218  In 1932  Stalin made socialist realism state policy in the Soviet Union when he promulgated the decree  On the Reconstruction of Literary and Art Organisations   This greatly stifled creativity  During the 1980s glasnost  openness  was introduced and Soviet artists and writers again became free to express themselves as they wanted  219  The tradition of the Easter egg  known as pysanky  has long roots in Ukraine  These eggs were drawn on with wax to create a pattern  then  the dye was applied to give the eggs their pleasant colours  the dye did not affect the previously wax coated parts of the egg  After the entire egg was dyed  the wax was removed leaving only the colourful pattern  This tradition is thousands of years old  and precedes the arrival of Christianity to Ukraine  220  In the city of Kolomya near the foothills of the Carpathian mountains in 2000 was built the museum of Pysanka which won a nomination as the monument of modern Ukraine in 2007  part of the Seven Wonders of Ukraine action  Language Percentage of native Ukrainian speakers by subdivision  Percentage of

the state language of Ukraine is Ukrainian  Russian  which was the de facto official language of the Soviet Union  is widely spoken  especially in eastern and southern Ukraine  According to the 2001 census  67 5 percent of the population declared Ukrainian as their native language and 29 6 percent declared Russian  221  Most native Ukrainian speakers know Russian as a second language  These details result in a significant difference across different survey results  as even a small restating of a question switches responses of a significant group of people  f  Ukrainian is mainly spoken in western and central Ukraine  In western Ukraine  Ukrainian is also the dominant language in cities  such as Lviv   In central Ukraine  Ukrainian and Russian are both equally used in cities  with Russian being more common in Kiev  f  while Ukrainian is the dominant language in rural communities  In eastern and southern Ukraine  Russian is primarily used in cities  and Ukrainian is used in rural areas  For a large part of the Soviet era  the number of Ukrainian speakers declined from generation to generation  and by the mid 1980s  the usage of the Ukrainian language in public life had decreased significantly  222  Following independence  the government of Ukraine began restoring the image and usage of Ukrainian language through a policy of Ukrainisation  223  Today  all foreign films and TV programs  including Russian ones  are subbed or dubbed in Ukrainian  According to the Constitution of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea  Ukrainian is the only state language of the republic  However  the republic s constitution specifically recognises Russian as the language of the majority of its population and guarantees its usage  in all spheres of public life   Similarly  the Crimean Tatar language  the language of 12 percent of population of Crimea  224  is guaranteed a special state protection as well as the  languages of other ethnicities   Russian speakers constitute an overwhelming majority of the Crimean population  77 percent   with Ukrainian speakers comprising just 10 1 percent  and Crimean Tatar speakers 11 4 percent  225  But in everyday life the majority of Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians in Crimea use Russian  226  Literature See also  Ukrainian literature The history of Ukrainian literature dates back to the 11th century  following the Christianisation of the Kievan Rus   227  The writings of the time were mainly liturgical and were written in Old Church Slavonic  Historical accounts of the time were referred to as chronicles  the most significant of which was the Primary Chronicle  228  g  Literary activity faced a sudden decline during the Mongol invasion of Rus   227  Ukrainian literature again began to develop in the 14th century  and was advanced significantly in the 16th century with the introduction of print and with the beginning of the Cossack era  under both Russian and Polish dominance  227  The Cossacks established an independent society and popularized a new kind of epic poems  which marked a high point of Ukrainian oral literature  228  These advances were then set back in the 17th and early 18th centuries  when publishing in the Ukrainian language was outlawed and prohibited  Nonetheless  by the late 18th century modern literary Ukrainian finally emerged  227  Ivan Kotlyarevsky 1769 1838  Taras Shevchenko 1814 1861  Stepan Rudansky 1834 1873  Ivan Franko 1856 1916  Lesya Ukrainka 1871 1913  The 19th century initiated a vernacular period in Ukraine  led by Ivan Kotliarevsky s work Eneyida  the first publication written in modern Ukrainian  By the 1830s  Ukrainian romanticism began to develop  and the nation s most renowned cultural figure  romanticist poet painter Taras Shevchenko emerged  Where Ivan Kotliarevsky is considered to be the father of literature in the Ukrainian vernacular  Shevchenko is the father of a national revival  229  Then  in 1863  use of the Ukrainian language in print was effectively prohibited by the Russian Empire  43  This severely curtained literary activity in the area  and Ukrainian writers were forced to either publish their works in Russian or release them in Austrian controlled Galicia  The ban was never officially lifted  but it became obsolete after the revolution and the Bolsheviks  coming to power  228  Ukrainian literature continued to flourish in the early Soviet years  when nearly all literary trends were approved  These policies faced a steep decline in the 1930s  when Stalin implemented his policy of socialist realism  The doctrine did not necessarily repress the Ukrainian language  but it required writers to follow a certain style in their works  Literary activities continued to be somewhat limited under the communist party  and it was not until Ukraine gained its independence in 1991 when writers were free to express themselves as they wished  227  Architecture Main article  Ukrainian architecture The various structures of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra date to different time periods  and through their styles offer an insight into the History of Ukraine and the rich craftsmanship that was developed in its long period Ukrainian architecture is a term that describes the motifs and styles that are found in structures built in modern Ukraine  and by Ukrainians worldwide  These include initial roots which were established in the Eastern Slavic state of Kievan Rus   After the 12th century  the distinct architectural history continued in the principalities of Galicia Volhynia  During the epoch of the Zaporozhian Cossacks  a new style unique to Ukraine was developed under the western influences of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth  After the union with the Tsardom of Russia  architecture in Ukraine began to develop in different directions  with many structures in the larger eastern  Russian ruled area built in the styles of Russian architecture of that period  whilst the western Galicia was developed under Austro Hungarian architectural influences  in both cases producing fine examples  Ukrainian national motifs would finally be used during the period of the Soviet Union and in modern independent Ukraine  The great churches of the Rus   built after the adoption of Christianity in 988  were the first examples of monumental architecture in the East Slavic lands  The architectural style of the Kievan state  which quickly established itself  was strongly influenced by the Byzantine  Early Eastern Orthodox churches were mainly made of wood  with the simplest form of church becoming known as a cell church  Major cathedrals often featured scores of small domes  which led some art historians to take this as an indication of the appearance of pre Christian pagan Slavic temples  The Vorontsov Palace  nestled at the foot of the Crimean Mountains  is an important example of Ukrainian gothic revival architecture Several examples of these churches survive to this day  however  during the 16th  17th  and 18th centuries  many were externally rebuilt in the Ukrainian Baroque style  see below   Examples include the grand St  Sophia of Kiev   the year 1017 is the earliest record of foundation laid  Church of the Saviour at Berestove   built from 1113 to 1125  and St  Cyril s Church  circa 12th century  All can still be found in the Ukrainian capital  Several buildings were reconstructed during the late 19th century  including the Assumption Cathedral in Volodymyr Volynskyi  built in 1160 and reconstructed in 1896 1900  the Paraskevi church in Chernihiv  built in 1201 with reconstruction done in the late 1940s  and the Golden gates in Kiev  built in 1037 and reconstructed in 1982  The latter s reconstruction was criticized by some art and architecture historians who   as a revivalist fantasy  Unfortunately little secular or vernacular architecture of Kievan Rus  has survived  Kiev s Maidan Nezalezhnosti is a prime example of the fusion of Stalinist and modern day architecture in Ukraine As Ukraine became increasingly integrated into the Russian Empire  Russian architects had the opportunity to realize their projects in the picturesque landscape that many Ukrainian cities and regions offered  St  Andrew s Church of Kiev  1747 1754   built by Bartolomeo Rastrelli  is a notable example of Baroque architecture  and its location on top of the Kievan mountain made it a recognizable monument of the city  An equally notable contribution of Rasetrelli was the Mariyinsky Palace  which was built to be a summer residence to Russian Empress Elizabeth  During the reign of the last Hetman of Ukraine  Kirill Razumovsky  many of the Cossack Hetmanate s towns such as Hlukhiv  Baturyn and Koselets had grandiose projects built by the appointed architect of Little Russia  Andrey Kvasov  Russia  winning successive wars over the Ottoman Empire and its vassal Crimean Khanate  eventually annexed the whole south of Ukraine and Crimea  Renamed New Russia  these lands were to be colonized  and new cities such as the Nikolayev  Odessa  Kherson and Sevastopol were founded  These would contain notable examples of Imperial Russian architecture  The Lviv Opera and Ballet Theatre  the architecture of Western Ukraine has been greatly influenced by its long history as part of Poland In 1934  the capital of Soviet Ukraine moved from Kharkiv to Kiev  During the preceding years  the city was seen as only a regional centre  and hence received little attention  All of that was to change  but at a great price  By this point  the first examples of Stalinist architecture were already showing  and  in light of the official policy  a new city was to be built on top of the old one  This meant that much admired examples such as the St  Michael s Golden Domed Monastery were destroyed  Even the St  Sophia Cathedral was under threat  Also  the Second World War contributed to the wreckage  After the war  a new project for the reconstruction of central Kiev was unveiled  This transformed the Khreshchatyk avenue into one of the most notable examples of Stalinism in Architecture  However  by 1955  the new politics of architecture once again promptly stopped the project from fully being realised  Europe mall in Dnipropetrovsk  an example of modern architecture in Ukraine  The task for modern Ukrainian architecture is diverse application of modern aesthetics  the search for an architect s own artistic style and inclusion of the existing historico cultural environment  An example of modern Ukrainian architecture is the reconstruction and renewal of the Maidan Nezalezhnosti in central Kiev  despite the limit set by narrow space within the plaza  the engineers were able to blend together the uneven landscape and also use underground space to set a new shopping centre  A major project  which may take up most of the 21st century  is the construction of the Kiev City Centre on the Rybalskyi Peninsula  which  when finished  will include a dense skyscraper park amid the picturesque landscape of the Dnieper  230  Music Main article  Music of Ukraine Mykola Lysenko  photo before 1912  is widely believed to be the father of Ukrainian classical music Music is a major part of Ukrainian culture  with a long history and many influences  From traditional folk music  to classical and modern rock  Ukraine has produced a long list of internationally recognized musical talent including Tchaikovsky and Okean Elzy  Elements from traditional Ukrainian folk music made their way into Western music and even into modern Jazz  Ukraine found itself at the crossroads of Asia and Europe and this is reflected within the music in a perplexing mix of exotic melismatic singing with chordal harmony which does not always easily fit the rules of traditional Western European harmony  The most striking general characteristic of authentic ethnic Ukrainian folk music is the wide use of minor modes or keys which incorporate augmented 2nd intervals  This is an indication that the major minor system developed in Western European music did not become as entrenched or as sophisticated in Ukraine  However  during the Baroque period  music was an important discipline for those that had received a higher education in Ukraine  It had a place of considerable importance in the curriculum of the Kyiv Mohyla Academy  Much of the nobility was well versed in music with many Ukrainian Cossack leaders such as  Mazepa  Paliy  Holovatyj  Sirko  being accomplished players of the kobza  bandura or torban  In the course of the 18th century in the Russian Empire court musicians were typically trained at the music academy in Hlukhiv  and largely came from Ukraine  Notable performers of the era include Tymofiy Bilohradsky who later studied lute under Sylvius Leopold Weiss in Dresden  his daughter Yelyzaveta who was a famous operatic soprano  and Oleksiy Rozumovsky  a court bandurist and the morganatic husband of Empress Elizabeth  The first dedicated musical academy was set up in Hlukhiv  Ukraine in 1738 and students were taught to sing  play violin and bandura from manuscripts  As a result many of the earliest composers and performers within the Russian empire were ethnically Ukrainian  having been born or educated in Hlukhiv  or had been closely associated with this music school  See  Dmytro Bortniansky  Maksym Berezovsky  Artemiy Vedel  Ukrainian classical music falls into three distinct categories defined by whether the composer was of Ukrainian ethnicity living in Ukraine  a composer of non Ukrainian ethnicity who was born or at some time was a citizen of Ukraine  or an ethnic Ukrainian living outside of Ukraine within the Ukrainian diaspora  The music of these three groups differs considerably  as do the audiences for whom they cater  Okean Elzy is one of the most popular modern day Ukrainian rock bands The first category is closely tied with the Ukrainian national school of music spearheaded by Mykola Lysenko  It includes such composers as Kyrylo Stetsenko  Mykola Leontovych  Levko Revutsky  Borys Lyatoshynsky  Mykola Vilinsky  Most of their music contains Ukrainian folk figures and are composed to Ukrainian texts  On the other hand  the second category is of particular importance and international visibility  because of the large percentage of ethnic minorities in urban Ukraine  This category includes such composers as Franz Xavier Mozart  Isaak Dunayevsky  Rheinhold Gliere  Yuliy Meitus and Sergei Prokofiev  performers Volodymyr Horovyts  David Oistrakh  Sviatoslav Richter and Isaac Stern  The music of these composers rarely contains Ukrainian folk motives and more often is written to the texts of Russian or Polish poets  Whilst the third category includes a number of prominent individuals who are often not part of the mainstream Ukrainian culture but who have made a significant impact on music in Ukraine  while living outside of its borders  These include historic individuals such as  Bortniansky  Berezovsky  Vedel  Tuptalo and Titov  It also contains  Soviet  composers such as Mykola Roslavets  Isaak Dunayevsky who were born in Ukraine but who moved to other cultural centres within the Soviet Union  In North America we have Mykola Fomenko  Yuriy Oliynyk  Zinoviy Lavryshyn and Wasyl Sydorenko  Since the mid 1960s  Western influenced pop music  in its various forms  that has been growing in popularity in Ukraine  One of the most important and truly original musicians to come out of Ukraine in recent years is the ultra avant garde folk singer and harmonium player Mariana Sadovska  Ukrainian pop and folk music arose with the international popularity of groups like Vopli Vidoplyasova  Viy 7  and Okean Elzy  A

Ukrainian culture  231  especially in Ukrainian wedding traditions  Ukrainian embroidery  weaving and lace making are used in traditional folk dress and in traditional celebrations  Ukrainian embroidery varies depending on the region of origin 232  and the designs have a long history of motifs  compositions  choice of colors and types of stitches  233  Use of color is very important and has roots in Ukrainian folklore  Embroidery motifs found in different parts of Ukraine are preserved in the Rushnyk Museum in Pereiaslav Khmelnytskyi  National dress is woven and highly decorated  Weaving with handmade looms is still practised in the village of Krupove  situated in Rivne Oblast  The village is the birth place of two famous personalities in the scene of national crafts fabrication  Nina Myhailivna 234  and Uliana Petrivna 235  with international recognition  In order to preserve this traditional knowledge the village is planning to open a local weaving center  a museum and weaving school  Sport See also  Sport in Ukraine Andriy Shevchenko  Ukrainian football player Ukraine greatly benefited from the Soviet emphasis on physical education  Such policies left
