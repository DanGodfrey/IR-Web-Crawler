Mexico and the Caribbean Sea  to the west and south  from the Atlantic Ocean  to the east and north  From the peninsula of Florida on the mainland of the United States  the islands stretch 1 200 miles  1 900 km  southeastward  then 500 miles  800 km  south  then west along the north coast of Venezuela on the South American mainland  Situated largely on the Caribbean Plate  the region comprises more than 7 000 islands  islets  reefs  and cays  These islands  called the West Indies  generally form island arcs that delineate the eastern and northern edges of the Caribbean Sea  4  The region consists of the Antilles  divided into the larger Greater Antilles which bound the sea on the north  the Lesser Antilles on the south and east  including the Leeward Antilles   the Bahamas  and the Turks and Caicos Islands  the Lucayan Archipelago   Geopolitically  the Caribbean islands are usually regarded as a subregion of North America 5  6  7  8  9  and are organized into 30 territories including sovereign states  overseas departments  and dependencies  From January 3  1958  to May 31  1962  there was a short lived country called the Federation of the West Indies composed of ten English speaking Caribbean territories  all of which were then UK dependencies  The West Indies cricket team continues to represent many of those nations  Contents 1 Etymology 2 Definition 3 Geography

name from that of the Carib  an ethnic group present in the Lesser Antilles and parts of adjacent South America at the time of European contact  10   edit  Definition Map of the Caribbean The word  Caribbean  has multiple uses  Its principal ones are geographical and political  The Caribbean can also be expanded to include territories with strong cultural and historical connections to slavery  European colonisation and the plantation system  The United Nations geoscheme for the Americas accords the Caribbean as a distinct region within The Americas  Physiographically  the Caribbean region consists mainly of the Caribbean Sea to north  bordered by the Gulf of Mexico  the Straits of Florida  the Northern Atlantic Ocean which lies to the east and northeast  and a chain of islands surrounding the Caribbean Sea  the coastline of the continent of South America lies to the south  Politically   Caribbean  may be centred on socio economic groupings found in the region  For example the block known as the Caribbean Community  CARICOM  contains both the Co operative Republic of Guyana and the Republic of Suriname found in South America  along with Belize in Central America as full members  Bermuda and the Turks and Caicos Islands which are found in the Atlantic Ocean are associate members of the Caribbean Community  and the same goes for the Commonwealth of the Bahamas which is a full member of the Caribbean Community  Alternately the organisation known as the Association of Caribbean States  ACS  consists of almost every nation in the surrounding regions which lie on the Caribbean plus El Salvador which lies solely on the Pacific Ocean  According to the ACS the total population of its member states is some 227 million people  11   edit  Geography and climate   The Caribbean plate The geography and climate in the Caribbean region varies  Some islands in the region have relatively flat terrain of non volcanic origin  These islands include Aruba  possessing only minor volcanic features   Barbados  Bonaire  the Cayman Islands  Saint Croix  The Bahamas or Antigua  Others possess rugged towering mountain ranges like the islands of Cuba  Hispaniola  Puerto Rico  Jamaica  Dominica  Montserrat  Saba  Saint Kitts  Saint Lucia  Saint Thomas  Saint John  Tortola  Grenada  Saint Vincent  Guadeloupe  Martinique  and Trinidad  amp  Tobago  The climate of the area is tropical but rainfall varies with elevation  size and water currents  cool upwellings keep the ABC islands arid   Warm  moist tradewinds blow consistently from the east creating rainforest semidesert divisions on mountainous islands  Occasional northwesterlies affect the northern islands in the winter  The region enjoys year round sunshine  divided into  dry  and  wet  seasons  with the last six months of the year being wetter than the first half  The waters of the Caribbean Sea host large  migratory schools of fish  turtles  and coral reef formations  The Puerto Rico trench  located on the fringe of the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea just to the north of the island of Puerto Rico  is the deepest point in all of the Atlantic Ocean  12  Hurricanes  which at times batter the region  usually strike northwards of Grenada  and to the west of Barbados  The principal hurricane belt arcs to northwest of the island of Barbados in the Eastern Caribbean  The region sits in the line of several major shipping routes with the Panama Canal connecting the western Caribbean Sea with the Pacific Ocean  Beach in Tobago Puerto Rico s south shore  from the mountains of Jayuya Puerto Cruz

Conservation International s biodiversity hotspots because of their exceptionally diverse terrestrial and marine ecosystems  ranging from montane cloud forests to cactus scrublands  The region also contains about 8   by surface area  of the world s coral reefs 14  along with extensive seagrass meadows  15  both of which are frequently found in the shallow marine waters bordering island and continental coasts off the region  For the fungi  there is a modern checklist based on nearly 90 000 records derived from specimens in reference collections  published accounts and field observations  16  That checklist includes more than 11250 species of fungi recorded from the region  As its authors note  the work is far from exhaustive  and it is likely that the true total number of fungal species already known from the Caribbean is higher  The true total number of fungal species occurring in the Caribbean  including species not yet recorded  is likely to be far higher  given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7  of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered  17  Although the amount of available information is still very small  a first effort has been made to estimate the number of fungal species endemic to some Caribbean islands  For Cuba  2200 species of fungi have been tentatively identified as possible endemics of the island  18  for Puerto Rico  the number is 789 species  19  for the Dominican Republic  the number is 699 species  20  for Trinidad and Tobago  the number is 407 species  21  Many of the ecosystems of the Caribbean islands have been devastated by deforestation  pollution  and human encroachment  The arrival of the first humans is correlated with extinction of giant owls and dwarf ground sloths  22  The hotspot contains dozens of highly threatened animals  ranging from birds  to mammals and reptiles   fungi and plants  Examples of threatened animals include the Puerto Rican Amazon  two species of solenodon  giant shrews  in Cuba and the Hispaniola island  and the Cuban crocodile    The template below  Wide image  is being considered for merging  See templates for discussion to help reach a consensus    Saona Island  Dominican Republic The region s coral reefs  which contain about 70 species of hard corals and between 500 700 species of reef associated fishes 23  have undergone rapid decline in ecosystem integrity in recent years  and are considered particularly vulnerable to global warming and ocean acidification  24  Some Caribbean islands have terrain that Europeans found suitable for cultivation for agriculture  Tobacco was an important early crop during the colonial era  but was eventually overtaken by sugarcane production as the region s staple crop  Sugar was produced from sugarcane for export to Europe  Cuba and Barbados were historically the largest producers of sugar  The tropical plantation system thus came to dominate Caribbean settlement  Other islands were found to have terrain unsuited for agriculture  for example Dominica  which remains heavily forested  The islands in the southern Lesser Antilles  Aruba  Bonaire and Cura ao  are extremely arid  making them unsuitable for agriculture  However  they have salt pans that were exploited by the Dutch  Sea water was pumped into shallow ponds  producing coarse salt when the water evaporated  25  The natural environmental diversity of the Caribbean islands has led to recent growth in eco tourism  This type of tourism is growing on islands lacking sandy beaches and dense human populations  26   edit  Plants and animals

in Dominica in the 1770s Cuban school children The population of the Caribbean is estimated to have been around 750 000 immediately before European contact  although lower and higher figures are given  After contact  social disruption and epidemic diseases such as smallpox and measles  to which they had no natural immunity  27  led to a decline in the Amerindian population  28  From 1500 to 1800 the population rose as slaves arrived from West Africa 29  such as the Kongo  Igbo  Akan  Fon and Yoruba as well as military prisoners and captured slaves from Ireland  who were deported during the Cromwellian reign in England  30  Immigrants from Britain  Italy  France  Spain  the Netherlands  Portugal and Denmark also arrived  although the mortality rate was high for both groups  31  The population is estimated to have reached 2 2 million by 1800  32  Immigrants from India  China  and other countries arrived in the 19th century  33  After the ending of the Atlantic slave trade  the population increased naturally  34  The total regional population was estimated at 37 5 million by 2000  35  The majority of the Caribbean has populations of mainly Africans in the French Caribbean  Anglophone Caribbean and Dutch Caribbean  there are minorities of mixed race and European peoples of Dutch  English  French  Italian and Portuguese ancestry  Asians  especially those of Chinese and Indian descent  form a significant minority in the region and also contribute to multiracial communities  All of their ancestors arrived in the 19th century as indentured laborers  The Spanish speaking Caribbean have primarily mixed race  African  or European majorities  Puerto Rico has a European majority with a mixture of European African mulatto   and a large West African minority  One third of Cuba s  largest Caribbean island  population is of African descent  with a sizable Mulatto  mixed African European  population  and European majority  The Dominican Republic has a largely mixed majority who are primarily descended from West Africans and Spaniards  with some Amerindians  Carnival in Trinidad and Tobago Larger islands such as Jamaica  have a very large African majority  in addition to a significant mixed race  Chinese  Europeans  Indian  Lebanese  Latin American  and Syrian populations  This is a result of years of importation of slaves and indentured labourers  and migration  Most multi racial Jamaicans refer to themselves as either mixed race or simply Black  The situation is similar for the Caricom states of Guyana  Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago  Trinidad and Tobago has a multi racial cosmopolitan society due to the arrival of the Africans  Indians  Chinese  Syrians  Lebanese  Native Amerindians and Europeans  This multi racial mix has created sub ethnicities that often straddle the boundaries of major ethnicities and include Chindian and Dougla   edit  Indigenous tribes Ciboney Ciguayo Kalinago Galibi Garifuna Igneri Lucayan Macorix Ta no

Community  CARICOM  Insignia of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America Caribbean societies are very different from other Western societies in terms of size  culture  and degree of mobility of their citizens  36  The current economic and political problems which the states face individually are common to all Caribbean states  Regional development has contributed to attempts to subdue current problems and avoid projected problems  From a political economic perspective  regionalism serves to make Caribbean states active participants in current international affairs through collective coalitions  In 1973  the first political regionalism in the Caribbean Basin was created by advances of the English speaking Caribbean nations through the institution known as the Caribbean Common Market and Community  CARICOM   37  Certain scholars have argued both for and against generalizing the political structures of the Caribbean  On the one hand the Caribbean states are politically diverse  ranging from communist systems such as Cuba toward more capitalist Westminster style parliamentary systems as in the Commonwealth Caribbean  Other scholars argue that these differences are superficial  and that they tend to undermine commonalities in the various Caribbean states  Contemporary Caribbean systems seem to reflect a  blending of traditional and modern patterns  yielding hybrid systems that exhibit significant structural variations and divergent constitutional traditions yet ultimately appear to function in similar ways   38  The political systems of the Caribbean states share similar practices  The influence of regionalism in the Caribbean is often marginalized  Some scholars believe that regionalism cannot not exist in the Caribbean because each small state is unique  On the other hand  scholars also suggest that there are commonalities amongst the Caribbean nations that suggest regionalism exists   Proximity as well as historical ties among the Caribbean nations has led to cooperation as well as a desire for collective action   39  These attempts at regionalization reflect the nations  desires to compete in the international economic system  39  Furthermore  a lack of interest from other major states promoted regionalism in the region  In recent years the Caribbean has suffered from a lack of U S  interest   With the end of the Cold War  U S  security and economic interests have been focused on other areas  As a result there has been a significant reduction in U S  aid and investment to the Caribbean   40  The lack of international support for these small  relatively poor states  helped regionalism prosper  Following the Cold War another issue of importance in the Caribbean has been the reduced economic growth of some Caribbean States due to the United States and European Union s allegations of special treatment toward the region by each other  clarification needed   edit  United States effects on regionalism The United States under President Bill Clinton launched a challenge in the World Trade Organization against the EU over Europe s preferential program  known as the Lom  Convention  which allowed banana exports from the former colonies of the Group of African  Caribbean and Pacific states  ACP  to enter Europe cheaply  41  The World Trade Organization sided in the United States  favour and the beneficial elements of the convention to African  Caribbean and Pacific states has been partially dismantled and replaced by the Cotonou Agreement  42  During the US EU dispute the United States imposed large tariffs on European Union goods  up to 100  on some imports  from the EU in order to pressure Europe to change the agreement with the Caribbean nations in favour of the Cotonou Agreement  43  Farmers in the Caribbean have complained of their falling profits and rising costs as the Lom  Convention weakens  Some farmers have faced increased pressure to turn towards the cultivation of illegal drugs  which has a higher profit margin and fills the sizable demand for these illegal drugs in North America and Europe  44  45   edit  European Union effects on regionalism The European Union has also taken issue with US based taxation extended to US companies via the Caribbean countries  The EU instituted a broad labeling of many nations as tax havens by the France based OECD  The United States has not been in favor of shutting off the practice yet  mainly due to the higher costs that would be passed on to US companies via taxation  Caribbean countries have largely countered the allegations by the OECD by signing more bilateral information sharing deals with OECD members  thus reducing the dangerous aspects of secrecy  and they have strengthened their legislation against money laundering and on the conditions under which companies can be based in their nations  The Caribbean nations have also started to more closely cooperate in the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force and other instruments to add oversight of the offshore industry  One of the most important associations that deal with regionalism amongst the nations of the Caribbean Basin has been the Association of Caribbean States  ACS   Proposed by CARICOM in 1992  the ACS soon won the support of the other countries of the region  It was founded in July 1994  The ACS maintains regionalism within the Caribbean on issues which are unique to the Caribbean Basin  Through coalition building  like the ACS and CARICOM  regionalism has become an undeniable part of the politics and economics of the Caribbean  The successes of region building initiatives are still debated by scholars  yet regionalism remains prevalent throughout the Caribbean   edit  Venezuela s effects on regionalism This section requires expansion  The President of Venezuela  Hugo Chavez launched an economic group known as the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas  ALBA  which saw several eastern Caribbean islands join
