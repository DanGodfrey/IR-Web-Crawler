List of areas in the United States National Park System From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search National Park Service logo  The National Park System of the United States is the collection of physical properties owned or administered by the National Park Service  This includes all areas designated National Parks and most National Monuments  as well as several other types of protected areas of the United States  As of 2011  there are 397 units of the National Park System  However  this number is somewhat misleading  For example  Denali National Park and Preserve is counted as two units  whereas Fort Moultrie is not counted as a unit because it is considered a feature of the Fort Sumter National Monument  In addition to areas of the National Park System  the National Park Service also provides technical and financial assistance to several affiliated areas authorized by Congress  Affiliated areas are marked on the lists below  The National Register of Historic Places is administered by the Park Service  with nearly 79 000 entries  and automatically includes all National Park System areas designated due to their historic significance  This includes all National Historical Parks Historic Sites  National Battlefields Military Parks  National Memorials  and some National Monuments  Delaware is the only state without a unit of the National Park System  Units are found in all other states  in Washington  D C   and in the U S  territories of Guam  the Northern Mariana Islands  American Samoa  the U S  Virgin Islands  and Puerto Rico  Nearly all units managed by the National Park Service participate in the National Park Passport Stamps program  Contents 1 National Parks 1 1 Existing National Parks 1 2 Disbanded National Parks 1 3 Proposed
