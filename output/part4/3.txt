c micus   denotes a hybrid medium having verbal side of its vocabulary tightly tied to its visual side in order to convey narrative or information only  the latter in case of non fiction comics  seeking synergy by using both visual  non verbal  and verbal side in interaction  Although some comics are picture only  pantomime strips  such as The Little King  the verbal side usually expand upon the pictures  but sometimes act in counterpoint  2  The term derives from the mostly humorous early work in the medium  and came to apply to that form of the medium including those far from comic  The sequential nature of the pictures  and the predominance of pictures over words  distinguishes comics from picture books  although some in comics studies disagree and claim that in fact what differentiates comics from other forms on the continuum from word only narratives  on one hand  to picture only narratives  on the other  is social context  3  Contents 1 Social context 2 History 2 1

External links  edit  Social context Comics as a real mass medium started to emerge in the United States in the early 20th century with the newspaper comic strip  where its form began to be standardized  image driven  speech balloons  etc    first in Sunday strips and later in daily strips  The combination of words and pictures proved popular and quickly spread throughout the world  Comic strips were soon gathered into cheap booklets and reprint comic books  Original comic books soon followed  Today  comics are found in newspapers  magazines  comic books  graphic novels and on the web  Historically  the form dealt with humorous subject matter  but its scope has expanded to encompass the full range of literary genres  Also see  Comic strip and cartoon  In some circles  comics are still seen as low art  4  5  6  7  8  9  though there are exceptions  such as Krazy Kat 10  and Barnaby  However  such an elitist  low art high art  distinction doesn t exist in the French speaking world  and  to some extent  continental Europe   where the bandes dessin es medium as a whole is commonly accepted as  the Ninth Art   is usually dedicated a non negligible space in bookshops and libraries  and is regularly celebrated in international events such as the Angoul me International Comics Festival  Such distinctions also do not exist in the Japanese manga  the world s largest comics culture  Critical discussions of the form appeared as early as the 1920s  10  11  but serious studies were rare until the late 20th century  12  Though practitioners may eschew formal traditions  they often use particular forms and conventions to convey narration and speech  or to evoke emotional or sensuous responses  Devices such as speech balloons and boxes are used to indicate dialogue and impart establishing information  while panels  layout  gutters and zip ribbons can help indicate the flow of the story  Comics use of text  ambiguity  symbolism  design  iconography  literary technique  mixed media and stylistic elements of art help build a subtext of meanings  Though comics are non linear structures and can be hard to read sometimes  it is simply presented  However  it depends of the reader s  frame of mind  to read and understand the comic  13  Different conventions were developed around the globe  from the manga of Japan to the manhua of China and the manhwa of Korea  the comic books of the United States  and the larger hardcover albums in Europe   edit  History Comics as an art form established itself in the late 19th and early 20th century  alongside the similar forms of film and animation  The three forms share certain conventions  most noticeably the mixing of words and pictures  and all three owe parts of their conventions to the technological leaps made through the industrial revolution  Though newspapers and magazines first established and popularized comics in the late 1890s  narrative illustration has existed for many centuries   edit  Early narratives in art Sequential depictions on Trajan s Column In Lucas Cranach the Elder s  Adam and Eve  different scenes of the Biblical story are shown in the same painting  on the front  God is admonishing the couple for their sin  in the background to the right are shown the earlier scenes of Eve s creation from Adam s rib and of their being tempted to eat the forbidden fruit  on the left is the later scene of their expulsion from Paradise  Early precursors of comic as they are known today include Trajan s Column and the work of William Hogarth  Rome s Trajan s Column  dedicated in 113 AD  is an early surviving example of a narrative told through sequential pictures  while Egyptian hieroglyphs  Greek friezes  medieval tapestries such as the Bayeux Tapestry and illustrated manuscripts also combine sequential images and words to tell a story  Versions of the Bible relying primarily on images rather than text were widely distributed in Europe in order to bring the teachings of Christianity to the illiterate  In medieval paintings  many sequential scenes of the same story  usually a Biblical one  appear simultaneously in the same painting  see illustration to left   However  these works did not travel to the reader  it took the invention of modern printing techniques to bring the form to a wide audience and become a mass medium  14  15  16   edit  The 15th 18th centuries and printing advances Last image in William Hogarth s A Rake s Progress The invention of the printing press  allowing movable type  established a separation between images and words  the two requiring different methods in order to be reproduced  Early printed material concentrated on religious subjects  but through the 17th and 18th centuries they began to tackle aspects of political and social life  and also started to satirize and caricature  It was also during this period that the speech bubble was developed as a means of attributing dialogue  William Hogarth is often identified in histories of the comics form  His work  A Rake s Progress  was composed of a number of canvases  each reproduced as a print  and the eight prints together created a narrative  As printing techniques developed  due to the technological advances of the industrial revolution  magazines and newspapers were established  These publications utilized illustrations as a means of commenting on political and social issues  such illustrations becoming known as cartoons in the 1840s  Soon  artists were experimenting with establishing a sequence of images to create a narrative  French Liberty  British Slavery  James Gillray s 1792 caricature poking fun at the French Revolution  anticipates the modern comic strip in having both separate panels and charactes speaking via speech balloons  While surviving works of these periods such as Francis Barlow s A True Narrative of the Horrid Hellish Popish Plot  c 1682  as well as The Punishments of Lemuel Gulliver and A Rake s Progress by William Hogarth  1726   can be seen to establish a narrative over a number of images  it wasn t until the 19th century that the elements of such works began to crystallise into the comic strip  The speech balloon also evolved during this period  from the medieval origins of the phylacter  a label  usually in the form of a scroll  which identified a character either through naming them or using a short text to explain their purpose  Artists such as George Cruikshank helped codify such phylacters as balloons rather than scrolls  though at this time they were still called labels  They now represented narative  but for identification purposes rather than dialogue within the work  and artists soon discarded them in favour of running dialogue underneath the panels  Speech balloons weren t reintroduced to the form until Richard F  Outcault used them for dialogue  17   edit  The 19th century  a form established A page by Rodolphe T pffer  whose work is considered influential in shaping the comics form  Rodolphe T pffer  a Francophone Swiss artist  is seen as the key figure of the early part of the 19th century  Though speech balloons fell from favour during the middle 19th century  T pffer s sequentially illustrated stories  with text compartmentalized below images  were reprinted throughout Europe and the United States  The lack of copyright laws at the time allowed these pirated editions  and translated versions created a market on both continents for similar works  18  In 1843  T pffer formalised his thoughts on the picture story in his Essay on Physiognomics   To construct a picture story does not mean you must set yourself up as a master craftsman  to draw out every potential from your material often down to the dregs  It does not mean you just devise caricatures with a pencil naturally frivolous  Nor is it simply to dramatize a proverb or illustrate a pun  You must actually invent some kind of play  where the parts are arranged by plan and form a satisfactory whole  You do not merely pen a joke or put a refrain in couplets  You make a book  good or bad  sober or silly  crazy or sound in sense   19  20  21  In 1845  the satirical drawings  which regularly appeared in newspapers and magazines  gained a name  cartoons   In art  a cartoon is a pencil or charcol sketch to be overpainted   The British magazine Punch  launched in 1841  referred to its  humorous pencilings  as cartoons in a satirical reference to the Parliament of the day  who were themselves organising an exhibition of cartoons  or preparatory drawings  at the time  This usage became common parlance  lasting to the present day  22  Similar magazines containing cartoons in continental Europe included Fliegende Bl tter and Le Charivari  while in the U S  Judge and Puck were popular  23  1865 saw the publication of Max and Moritz by Wilhelm Busch by a German newspaper  Busch refined the conventions of sequential art  and his work was a key influence within the form  Rudolph Dirks was inspired by the strip to create The Katzenjammer Kids in 1897  24  It is around this time that Manhua  the Chinese form of comics  started to formalize  a process that lasted up until 1927  25  The introduction of lithographic printing methods derived from the West was a critical step in expanding the form within China during the early 20th century  Like Europe and the United States  satirical drawings were appearing in newspapers and periodicals  initially based on works from those countries  One of the first magazines of satirical cartoons was based on the United Kingdom s Punch  snappily re branded as  The China Punch   25  The first piece drawn by a person of Chinese nationality was  The Situation in the Far East  from Tse Tsan Tai  printed 1899 in Japan  By the 1920s  a market was established for palm sized picture books like Lianhuanhua  26  In 1884  Ally Sloper s Half Holiday was published  a magazine whose selling point was a strip featuring the titular character  and widely regarded as the first comic strip magazine to feature a recurring character  In 1890  two more comic magazines debuted to the British public  Comic Cuts and Illustrated Chips  establishing the tradition of the British comic as an anthology periodical containing comic strips  16  In the United States  R F  Outcault s work in combining speech balloons and images on Hogan s Alley and The Yellow Kid has been credited as establishing the form and conventions of the comic strip  27  though academics have uncovered earlier works that combine speech bubbles and a multi image narrative  However  the popularity of Outcalt s work and the position of the strip in a newspaper retains credit as a driving force of the form  28  29   edit  The 20th century and the mass medium Little Sammy Sneeze  1904 06  by Winsor McCay The 1920s and 1930s saw further booms within the industry  In China  a market was established for palm sized picture books like Lianhuanhua  26  while the market for comic anthologies in Britain had turned to targeting children through juvenile humor  with The Dandy and The Beano launched  In Belgium  Herg  created the Tintin newspaper strip for a comic supplement  this was successfully collected in a bound album and created a market for further such works  The same period in the United States had seen newspaper strips expand their subject matter beyond humour  with action  adventure and mystery strips launched  The collection of such material also began  with The Funnies  a reprint collection of newspaper strips  published in tabloid size in 1929  A market for such comic books soon followed  and by 1938 publishers were printing original material in the format  It was at this point that Action Comics 1 launched  with Superman as the cover feature  The popularity of the character swiftly enshrined the superhero as the defining genre of American comics  The genre lost popularity in the 1950s but re established its domination of the form from the 1960s until the late 20th century  In Japan  a country with a long tradition for illustration and whose writing system evolved from pictures  comics were hugely popular  Referred to as manga  the Japanese form was established after World War II by Osamu Tezuka  who expanded the page count of a work to number in the hundreds  and who developed a filmic style  heavily influenced by the Disney animations of the time  The Japanese market expanded its range to cover works in many genres  from juvenile fantasy through romance to adult fantasies  Japanese manga is typically published in large anthologies  containing several hundred pages  and the stories told have long been used as sources for adaptation into animated film  In Japan  such films are referred to as anime  and many creators work in both forms simultaneously  leading to an intrinsic linking of the two forms  During the latter half of the 20th century comics have become a very popular item for collectors and from the 1970s American comics publishers have actively encouraged collecting and shifted a large portion of comics publishing and production to appeal directly to the collector s community  Alan Moore  whose works have done much to popularise the medium  Writing in 1972  Sir Ernst Gombrich felt T pffer had evolved a new pictorial language  that of an abbreviated art style  which allowed the audience to fill in gaps with their imagination  30  The modern double use of the term comic  as an adjective describing a genre  and a noun designating an entire medium  has been criticised as confusing and misleading  In the 1960s and 1970s  underground cartoonists used the spelling comix to distinguish their work from mainstream newspaper strips and juvenile comic books  Their work was written for an adult audience but was usually comedic  so the  comic  label was still appropriate  31  The term graphic novel was popularized in the late 1970s  having been coined at least two decades previous  to distance the material from this confusion  32  In the 1980s  comics scholarship started to blossom in the U S   33  and a resurgence in the popularity of comics was seen  with Alan Moore and Frank Miller producing notable superhero works and Bill Watterson s Calvin  amp  Hobbes being syndicated  In 2005  Robert Crumb s work was exhibited in galleries both sides of the Atlantic  and The Guardian newspaper devoted its tabloid supplement to a week long exploration of his work and idioms  34  Comics have been a popular source for film and television adaptations   edit  Forms Carl Barks  Donald Duck comics artist  signing autographs in 1994  Comics have been presented within a wide number of publishing and typographical formats  from the very short panel cartoon to the more lengthy graphic novel  The cartoon  traditionally containing satirical or humorous content in the manner of those seen in The New Yorker or Private Eye  originate from the mid nineteenth century  This form of comics is still popular  though the last few years has seen a reduction in the number of editorial cartoonists employed in the US media  35  There is dispute as to whether the cartoon is a form of comics  a precursor  or a related form but some argue that since the cartoon combines words with image and constructs a narrative  it is a form of comic  The comic strip is simply a sequence of cartoons that unite to tell a story  Originally  the term comic strip applied to any sequence of cartoons  no matter the venue of publication or length of the sequence  but now  mainly in the United States  the term refers to the strips published in newspapers as Sunday or daily strips  These strips are now typically humorous or satirical strips  such as H gar the Horrible and Doonesbury  but have often been action themed  educational or even biographical  In the United States the term  comics  is sometimes used to describe the page of a newspaper upon which comic strips are found  with the term  comic  quickly adopting through popular usage to refer to the form rather than the content  36  37  Said pages are also referred to as the  funny pages   and comics are hence sometimes called  the funnies   38  In the United Kingdom  the term comic strip still applies to longer stories that appear in comics  such as 2000 AD or The Beano   edit  Publication formats George Herriman s Krazy Kat  January 6  1918  Over time  a number of formats  from the comic book to the webcomic  have become closely associated with the form  The American comic book originated in the early part of the 20th century and grew from magazines that repackaged newspaper comic strips  Eventually  publishers commissioned original work  and the material developed from its humorous origins to encompass adventure stories  romance  war and superheroes  with the latter genre dominating comic book publishing by the late 20th century  Though called comic books  these publications are more like magazines  having soft covers printed on glossy paper  with interiors of newsprint or higher grade paper  In Europe  magazines were always a venue for original material in the form  and such comic magazines or comic books soon grew into anthologies that serialized a number of stories  In continental Europe a market soon established itself to support collections of these strips  All of these publications are generally referred to as  comics  for short  with typical American and British comic books or magazines running 32 pages  including advertisements and letter column   These are sometimes known as 36 page books  counting the covers   European comic magazines have wildly varying page numbers  currently ranging mostly between 52 and 120 pages  while European comic albums traditionally had between 32 and 62 pages  Graphic novels on display for sale in a specialist shop  In the United States  when a publisher collects previously serialized stories  such a collection is commonly referred to as either a trade paperback or as a graphic novel  These are books  typically squarebound and published with a card cover  containing no advertisements  They generally collect a single story  which has been broken into a number of chapters previously serialized in comic books  with the issues collectively known as a story arc  Such trade paperbacks can contain anywhere from four issues  for example  there is Kingdom Come by Mark Waid and Alex Ross  to as many as twenty  The Death of Superman   In continental Europe  especially Belgium and France  such collections are usually somewhat larger in size and published with a hardback cover  a format established by the Tintin  series in the 1930s  These are referred to as comic albums  39  a term that in the United States refers to anthology books  The United Kingdom has no great tradition of such collections  though during the 1980s Titan publishing launched a line collecting stories previously published in 2000 AD  The graphic novel format is similar to typical book publishing  with works being published in both hardback and paperback editions  The term has proved a difficult one to fully define  and refers not only to fiction but also factual works  and is also used to describe collections of previously serialised works as well as original material  Some publishers distinguish between such material  using the term  original graphic novel  for work commissioned especially for the form  Newspaper strips also get collected  both in Europe and in the United States  In the US  the selection of strips to be reprinted in books has often been somewhat haphazard  but there have been several recent efforts to produce complete collections of the more popular newspaper strips  In the UK  it is traditional for the children s comics market to release comic annuals  which are hardback books containing strips  as well as text stories and puzzles and games  40  41  42  In the United States  the comic annual was a summer publication  typically an extended comic book  with storylines often linked across a publisher s line of comics  Bill Holman s Smokey Stover  an example of a popular American strip translated for publication in France  In Japan  comics are usually first serialized in manga magazines and latter compiled in tank bon format  In South Africa  Supa Strikas  a weekly comic book reaching more than a million readers worldwide  uses advertising embedded in each frame of the comic strip to generate revenue  rather than charging its readers  Webcomics  also known as online comics  are comics that are available on the Internet  Many webcomics are exclusively published online  while some are published in print but maintain a web archive for either commercial or artistic reasons  With the Internet s easy access to an audience  webcomics run the gamut from traditional comic strips to graphic novels and beyond  Webcomics are similar to self published print comics in that almost anyone can create their own webcomic and publish it on the Web  Currently  there are thousands of webcomics available online  with some achieving popular  critical  or commercial success  The Perry Bible Fellowship is syndicated in print  while Brian Fies  Mom s Cancer won the inaugural Eisner Award for digital comics in 2005 and was subsequently collected and published in hardback  The comics form can also be utilized to convey information in mixed media  For example  strips designed for educative or informative purposes  notably the instructions upon an airplane s safety card  These strips are generally referred to as instructional comics  The comics form is also utilized in the film and animation industry  through storyboarding  Storyboards are illustrations displayed in sequence for the purpose of visualizing an animated or live action film  A storyboard is essentially a large comic of the film or some section of the film produced beforehand to help the directors and cinematographers visualize the scenes and find potential problems before they occur  Often storyboards include arrows or instructions that indicate movement  Like many other media  comics can also be self published  One typical format for self publishers and aspiring professionals is the minicomic  typically small  often photocopied and stapled or with a handmade binding  These are a common inexpensive way for those who want to make their own comics on a very small budget  with mostly informal means of distribution  A number of cartoonists have started this way and gone on to more traditional types of publishing  while other more established artists continue to produce minicomics on the side  In Japan self published comics  know as d jinshi  have their own very popular comic convention  the Comiket  that has an attendance of more than half million people   edit  Artistic medium  edit  Defining comics Scholars disagree on the definition of comics  some claim its printed format is crucial  some emphasize the interdependence of image and text  and others its sequential nature  The term as a reference to the medium has also been disputed  Will Eisner  who established the term sequential art and is considered to have popularized the graphic novel  In 1996  Will Eisner published Graphic Storytelling  in which he defined comics as  the printed arrangement of art and balloons in sequence  particularly in comic books   43  Eisner s earlier  more influential definition from Comics and Sequential Art  1985  described the technique and structure of comics as sequential art   the arrangement of pictures or images and words to narrate a story or dramatize an idea   44  In Understanding Comics  1993  Scott McCloud defined sequential art and comics as  juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence  intended to convey information and or to produce an aesthetic response in the viewer   45  this definition excludes single panel illustrations such as The Far Side  The Family Circus and most political cartoons from the category  classifying those as cartoons  By contrast  The Comics Journal s  100 Best Comics of the 20th Century   46  included the works of several single panel cartoonists and a caricaturist  and academic study of comics has included political cartoons  47  R  C  Harvey  in his essay Comedy at the Juncture of Word and Image  offered a competing definition in reference to McCloud s       comics consist of pictorial narratives or expositions in which words  often lettered into the picture area within speech balloons  usually contribute to the meaning of the pictures and vice versa   48  This  however  ignores the existence of pantomime comics  such as Carl Anderson s Henry  49  Most agree that animation  which creates the optical illusion of movement within a static physical frame  is a separate form  though ImageTexT  a peer reviewed academic journal focusing on comics  accepts submissions relating to animation as well  50  and the third annual Conference on Comics at the University of Florida focused on comics and animation  51   edit  Art styles Scott McCloud  whose work Understanding Comics identified the different styles of art used within comics  While almost all comics art is in some sense abbreviated  and also while every artist who has produced comics work brings their own individual approach to bear  some broader art styles have been identified  Comic strip artists Cliff Sterrett and Gus Arriola often used unusual  colorful backgrounds  sometimes veering into abstract art  The basic styles have been identified as realistic and cartoony  with a huge middle ground for which R  Fiore has coined the phrase liberal  Fiore has also expressed distaste with the terms realistic and cartoony  preferring the terms literal and freestyle  respectively  52  Scott McCloud has created The Big Triangle 53  as a tool for thinking about comics art  He places the realistic representation in the bottom left corner  with iconic representation  or cartoony art  in the bottom right  and a third identifier  abstraction of image  at the apex of the triangle  This allows placement and grouping of artists by triangulation  The cartoony style uses comic effects and a variation of line widths for expression  Characters tend to have rounded  simplified anatomy  Noted exponents of this style are Carl Barks and Jeff Smith  52  The realistic style  also referred to as the adventure style is the one developed for use within the adventure strips of the 1930s  They required a less cartoony look  focusing more on realistic anatomy and shapes  and used the illustrations found in pulp magazines as a basis  54  This style became the basis of the superhero comic book style  since Joe Shuster and Jerry Siegel originally worked Superman up for publication as an adventure strip  55  McCloud also notes that in several traditions  there is a tendency to have the main characters drawn rather simplistic and cartoony  while the backgrounds and environment are depicted realistically  Thus  he argues  the reader easily identifies with the characters   as they are similar to one s idea of self   whilst being immersed into a world  that s three dimensional and textured  53  Good examples of this phenomenon include Herge s The Adventures of Tintin  in his  personal trademark  Ligne claire style   Will Eisner s Spirit and Osamu Tezuka s Buddha  among many others   edit  Language As noted above  two distinct definitions have been used to define comics as an art form  the combination of both word and image  and the placement of images in sequential order  Both definitions are lacking  in that the first excludes any sequence of wordless images  and the second excludes single panel cartoons such as editorial cartoons  The purpose of comics is certainly that of narration  and so that must be an important factor in defining the art form  Comics  as sequential art  emphasise the pictorial representation of a narrative  This means comics are not an illustrated version of standard literature  and while some critics argue that they are a hybrid form of art and literature  others contend comics are a new and separate art  an integrated whole  of words and images both  where the pictures do not just depict the story  but are part of the telling  In comics  creators transmit expression through arrangement and juxtaposition of either pictures alone  or word s  and picture s   to build a narrative  The narration of a comic is set out through the layout of the images  and while  as in films  there may be many people who work on one work  one vision of the narrative guides the work  Artists can use the layout of images on a page to convey passage of time  build suspense or highlight action  56  For a fuller exploration of the language  see Comics vocabulary   edit  Comic creation Comics artists usually sketch a drawing in pencil before going over the drawing in India ink  using either a dip pen or a brush  Artists may also use a lightbox to create the final image in ink  Some artists  Brian Bolland for example  57  use computer graphics  with the published work as the first physical appearance of the artwork  By many definitions  including McCloud s  above  the definition of comics extends to digital media such as webcomics and the mobile comic  The nature of the comics work being created determines the number of people who work on its creation  with successful comic strips and comic books being produced through a studio system  in which an artist assembles a team of assistants to help create the work  However  works from independent companies  self publishers or those of a more personal nature can be produced by a single creator  Within the comic book industry of the United States  the studio system has come to be the main method of creation  Through its use by the industry  the roles have become heavily codified  and the managing of the studio has become the company s responsibility  with an editor discharging the management duties  The editor assembles a number of creators and oversees the work to publication  Any number of people can assist in the creation of a comic book in this way  from a plotter  a breakdown artist  a penciller  an inker  a scripter  a letterer and a colorist  with some roles being performed by the same person  In contrast  a comic strip tends to be the work of a sole creator  usually termed a cartoonist  However  it is not unusual for a cartoonist to employ the studio method  particularly when a strip become successful  Mort Walker employed a studio  while Bill Watterson eschewed the studio method  preferring to create the strip himself  Gag  political and editorial cartoonists tend to work alone as well  though a cartoonist may use assistants   edit  Tools Artists use a variety of pencils  paper  typically Bristol board and a waterproof ink  When inking  many artists preferred to use a Winsor  amp  Newton Series 7   3 brush as the main tool  which could be used in conjunction with other brushes  dip pens  a fountain pen and or a variety of technical pens or markers  Mechanical tints can be employed to add grey tone to an image  An artist might paint with acrylics  gouache  poster paints or watercolors  Color can also be achieved through crayons  pastels or colored pencils  Eraser  rulers  templates  set squares and a T square assist in creating lines and shapes  A drawing table provides an angled work surface with lamps sometimes attached to the table  A light box allows an artist to trace his pencil work when inking  allowing for a looser finish  Knives and scalpels fill a variety of needs  including cutting board or scraping off mistakes  A cutting mat aids paper trimming  Process white is a thick opaque white material for covering mistakes  Adhesives and tapes help composite an image from different sources   edit  Computer generated comics Computers dramatically changed the industry  and today many cartoonists and illustrators create digital illustrations using computers  graphics tablets and scanners  Digital art has replaced traditional pen and ink drawings on an increasing number of comic books and strips  Historically  the first fully computer generated comics were Shatter by Peter B  Gillis and Mike Saenz in 1985  and Batman  Digital Justice by Pepe Moreno in 1990  Writer Sharon Bowers collaborated with artist Adrian Sinnott on Hunny Bunny s Short Tale  brief bedtime stories for kids  syndicated by King Features in the mid to late 1990s  the feature was one of the first panel cartoons delivered electronically  Some illustrators do a pencil sketch  scan it and then use different software programs to execute the finished art  enlarging sections of the drawing for detailed close work  To create comic book covers  Jim McDermott transfers his drawings to his computer and then develops digital paintings simulating the appearance of acrylic or oil paintings  Dave McKean also has combined both traditional and digital methods  Lackadaisy creator Tracy Butler explained her method  When doing linework  my preference is to go about it the old fashioned way with a simple mechanical pencil and some sturdy paper  Once a page is fully pencilled  I scan it and begin working digitally on the cleanup  lighting and toning  For this  I generally rely on Adobe Photoshop  a trusty tablet and pen  and a lot of coffee  58  59  In 1998  Pete Nash displayed fully digitized artwork on his Striker comic strip for The Sun  60  Computers are now widely used for both coloring and lettering  forcing some comic book letterers to look elsewhere for work  Snuffy Smith cartoonist Fred Lasswell  a prolific inventor and early adopter of new technology  was one of the first cartoonists to email comic strips to King Features Syndicate  and he also pioneered the use of computer generated lettering  On the comic strip Blondie  computer technology makes it possible for the writer Dean Young  the cartoonist John Marshall and the art assistant Frank Cummings to collaborate even though they live in three different states  Marshall s studio is in Binghamton  New York and Cummings lives in Birmingham  Alabama  while Young alternates between Vermont and Florida  To capture the finely polished inking details seen in Blondie  Marshall works on a Wacom tablet linked to his Macintosh  First he draws a rough  sent to Young for review  and then it s back to the computer for the finished art  delivered electronically to King Features  61  Artist Sophy Khon from Up Up Down Down uses Manga Studio  which is just one of a number of software packages specifically aimed at creating web comics in a fast and easy manner  The software Movie2Comics alters film clips into comics  as the creators explain  As a type of artwork  comics is prevalent and popular around the world  However  despite the availability of assistive software and tools  the creation of comics is still a labor intensive and time consuming process  This paper proposes a scheme that is able to automatically turn a movie clip to comics  Two principles are followed in the scheme   1  optimizing the information preservation of the movie  and  2  generating outputs following the rules and the styles of comics  The scheme mainly contains three components  script face mapping  descriptive picture extraction and cartoonization  The script face mapping utilizes face tracking and recognition techniques to accomplish the mapping between characters faces and their scripts  The descriptive picture extraction then generates a sequence of frames for presentation  Finally  the cartoonization is accomplished via three steps  panel scaling  stylization  and comics layout design  Experiments are conducted on a set of movie clips and the results have demonstrated the usefulness and the effectiveness of the
