American exceptionalism From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search American exceptionalism refers to the theory that the United States is qualitatively different from other countries  In this view  America s exceptionalism stems from its emergence from a revolution  becoming  the first new nation   1  and developing a uniquely American ideology  based on liberty  egalitarianism  individualism  populism and laissez faire  This observation can be traced to Alexis de Tocqueville  the first writer to describe the United States as  exceptional  in 1831 and 1840  2  Historian Gordon Wood has argued   Our beliefs in liberty  equality  constitutionalism  and the well being of ordinary people came out of the Revolutionary era  So too did our idea that we Americans are a special people with a special destiny to lead the world toward liberty and democracy   3  The specific term  American exceptionalism  was first used in 1929 by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin chastising members of the Lovestone led faction of the American Communist Party for the heretical  according to Stalin  belief that America was independent of the Marxist laws of history  thanks to its natural resources  industrial capacity  and absence of rigid class distinctions   4  5  Although the term does not necessarily imply superiority  many neoconservative and American conservative writers have promoted its use in that sense  1  6  To them  the United States is like the biblical  shining city on a hill   and exempt from historical forces that have affected other countries  7  Since the 1960s  postnationalist  scholars on the left have rejected American exceptionalism  arguing that the United States had not broken from European history  and has retained class inequities  imperialism and war  Furthermore  they saw every nation as subscribing to some form of exceptionalism  8  Contents 1 Origins 2 Other nations 3 Causes in their historical context 3 1 Absence of

Similarities between the United States and Europe 7 See also 8 Notes 9 Bibliography 10 External links  edit  Origins Historian Dorothy Ross discussed three currents in American exceptionalism  Protestant American Christians believed American progress would lead to the Christian Millennium   9  American writers also linked their history to the development of liberty in Anglo Saxon England  even back to the traditions of the Teutonic tribes that conquered the western Roman empire  10  Other American writers looked to the  millennial newness  of America  seeing the mass of  virgin land  promised an escape from the decay that befell earlier republics  11  The French writer Alexis de Tocqueville first wrote about it in his 1831 work  Democracy in America  12  The position of the Americans is therefore quite exceptional  and it may be believed that no democratic people will ever be placed in a similar one  Their strictly Puritanical origin  their exclusively commercial habits  even the country they inhabit  which seems to divert their minds from the pursuit of science  literature  and the arts  the proximity of Europe  which allows them to neglect these pursuits without relapsing into barbarism  a thousand special causes  of which I have only been able to point out the most important  have singularly concurred to fix the mind of the American upon purely practical objects  His passions  his wants  his education  and everything about him seem to unite in drawing the native of the United States earthward  his religion alone bids him turn  from time to time  a transient and distracted glance to heaven  Let us cease  then  to view all democratic nations under the example of the American people  13  American exceptionalism is closely tied to the idea of Manifest Destiny  14  a term used by Jacksonian Democrats in the 1840s to promote the acquisition of much of what is now the Western United States  the Oregon Territory  the Texas Annexation  the Gadsden Purchase  and the Mexican Cession    edit  Other nations Some scholars argue that other nations have also demonstrated exceptionalism in terms of systematically engaging in what they considered benevolent enterprises  such as Britain at the height of the British Empire  as well as the Communist state in Russia  and France in the wake of the French Revolution  15   edit  Causes in their historical context Scholars have explored possible justifications for the notion of American exceptionalism   edit  Absence of feudalism Many scholars use a model of American exceptionalism developed by Harvard political scientist Louis Hartz  In The Liberal Tradition in America  1955   Hartz argued that the American political tradition lacked the left wing socialist and right wing aristocratic elements that dominated in most other lands because colonial America lacked any feudal traditions  such as established churches  landed estates and a hereditary nobility  16  The  liberal consensus  school  typified by David Potter  Daniel Boorstin and Richard Hofstadter followed Hartz in emphasizing that political conflicts in American history remained within the tight boundaries of a liberal consensus regarding private property  individual rights  and representative government  The national government that emerged was far less centralized or nationalized as European counterparts  17   edit  Puritan roots Parts of American exceptionalism can be traced to American Puritan roots  18  Many Puritans with Arminian leanings embraced a middle ground between strict Calvinist predestination and a less restricting theology of Divine Providence  They believed God had made a covenant with their people and had chosen them to lead the other nations of the Earth  One Puritan leader  John Winthrop  metaphorically expressed this idea as a  City upon a Hill  that the Puritan community of New England should serve as a model community for the rest of the world  19  This metaphor is often used by proponents of exceptionalism  The Puritans  deep moralistic values remained part of the national identity of the United States for centuries  remaining influential to the present day   edit  American Revolution and Republicanism The ideas that created the American Revolution were derived from a tradition of republicanism that had been repudiated by the British mainstream  Thomas Paine s Common Sense for the first time expressed the belief that America was not just an extension of Europe but a new land  a country of nearly unlimited potential and opportunity that had outgrown the British mother country  20  These sentiments laid the intellectual foundations for the Revolutionary concept of American exceptionalism and were closely tied to republicanism  the belief that sovereignty belonged to the people  not to a hereditary ruling class  21  Religious freedom characterized the American Revolution in unique ways at a time when major nations had state religions  Republicanism  led by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison  created modern constitutional republicanism  with a limit on ecclesiastical powers  Historian Thomas Kidd  2010  argues   With the onset of the revolutionary crisis  a major conceptual shift convinced Americans across the theological spectrum that God was raising up America for some special purpose   22  Kidd further argues that  a new blend of Christian and republican ideology led religious traditionalists to embrace wholesale the concept of republican virtue   23   edit  Jefferson  amp  Empire of Liberty According to Tucker and Hendrickson  1992  Jefferson believed America  was the bearer of a new diplomacy  founded on the confidence of a free and virtuous people  that would secure ends based on the natural and universal rights of man  by means that escaped war and its corruptions   Jefferson sought a radical break from the traditional European emphasis on  reason of state   which could justify any action  and the traditional priority of foreign policy and the needs of the ruling family over the needs of the people  24  Jefferson envisaged America becoming the world s great  empire of liberty   that is  the model for democracy and republicanism  He identified his nation as a beacon to the world  for  he said on departing the presidency in 1809  America was   Trusted with the destinies of this solitary republic of the world  the only monument of human rights  and the sole depository of the sacred fire of freedom and self government  from hence it is to be lighted up in other regions of the earth  if other regions of the earth shall ever become susceptible of its benign influence   25   edit  Democracy Alexis de Tocqueville stressed the advanced nature of democracy in America  arguing that it infused every aspect of society and culture  at a time  1830s  when democracy was not in fashion anywhere else  26   edit  Immigration One of Alexis de Toqueville s original arguments for American exceptionalism still stands  America remains particularly attractive to immigrants because of its perceived economic and political opportunities  Since its founding  many immigrants  such as Alexander Hamilton  Albert Gallatin  James J Hill  John Jacob Astor  Andrew Carnegie  Charlie Chaplin  Samuel Goldwyn  Bob Hope  Saul Bellow  Henry Kissinger  Madeleine Albright and Arnold Schwarzenegger have risen to the top in business  media and politics  not to mention the success of the children of immigrants  such as Colin Powell and Barack Obama  The  American Dream  describes the perceived abundance of opportunities in the American system  The United States has the largest population of immigrants in the world over 38 5 million people living in the United States are first generation immigrants  27  although on a percentage basis the immigrant population ranks 48th in the world  28  On an annual basis  the United States naturalizes approximately 898 000 immigrants as new citizens  first in the world in absolute terms  29  and 8th in the world in per capita terms  30  From 1960 to 2005  the United States was ranked first in the world for every five year period but one for the total number of immigrants admitted overall  since 1995  the United States has admitted over 1 million immigrants per year  31  Of the top ten countries accepting resettled refugees in 2006  the United States accepted more than twice as many as the next nine countries combined  approximately 50 000 refugees  in addition  on average  over 100 000 refugees per year were resettled annually between 1990 and 2000  further  over 85 000 asylum seekers annually come to the United States in search of sanctuary  of which approximately 45  are successful in obtaining   edit  American Communism In June 1927 Jay Lovestone  a leader of the Communist Party in America and soon to be named General Secretary  described America s economic and social uniqueness  He noted the increasing strength of American capitalism  and the country s  tremendous reserve power   a strength and power which he said prevented Communist revolution  32  In 1929  the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin  disagreeing that America was so resistant to revolution  called Lovestone s ideas  the heresy of American exceptionalism  33  the first time that the specific term  American exceptionalism  was used  34  In the 1930s  academicians in the U S  redefined American exceptionalism as befitting a nation that was to lead the world  with the newer United States ready to serve the older European societies as an example of a liberated future free from Marxism and socialism  33  More recently  socialists and other writers have tried to discover or describe this exceptionalism of the U S  within and outside its borders  35   edit  Aspects of arguments  edit  Republican ethos and ideas about nationhood Proponents of American exceptionalism argue that the United States is exceptional in that it was founded on a set of republican ideals  rather than on a common heritage  ethnicity  or ruling elite  In the formulation of President Abraham Lincoln in his Gettysburg Address  America is a nation  conceived in liberty  and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal   In this view  America is inextricably connected with liberty and equality  This interpretation of American exceptionalism has been championed by Newt Gingrich  In a 2011 film  A City Upon a Hill 36  and book  A Nation Like No Other  Gingrich argues the claim to  exceptionalism  is  built on the unique belief that our rights do not come from the government  but from God  giving honor and responsibility to the individual    not the state   37  The United States  policies have been characterized since their inception by a system of federalism and checks and balances  which were designed to prevent any person  faction  region  or government organ from becoming too powerful  Some proponents of the theory of American exceptionalism argue that this system and the accompanying distrust of concentrated power prevent the United States from suffering a  tyranny of the majority   are preservative a free republican democrat  and also that it allows citizens to live in a locality whose laws reflect that citizen s values  A consequence of this political system is that laws can vary greatly across the country  Critics of American exceptionalism maintain that this system merely replaces the power of the national majority over states with power by the states over local entities  On balance  the American political system arguably allows more local dominance but prevents more national dominance than does a more unitary system   edit  Frontier spirit Proponents of American exceptionalism often claim that the  American spirit  or the  American identity  was created at the frontier  following Frederick Jackson Turner s Frontier Thesis   where rugged and untamed conditions gave birth to American national vitality  However  this  frontier spirit  was not unique to the United States other nations such as New Zealand  Canada  South Africa  Brazil  Argentina and Australia had long frontiers that were similarly settled by pioneers  shaping their national psyches  In fact  all of the British Imperial domains involved pioneering work  Although each nation had slightly different frontier experiences  for example  in Australia  mateship  and working together was valued more than individualism was in the United States 38    the characteristics arising from British attempting to  tame  a wild and often hostile landscape against the will of the original population remained common to many such nations  Of course  at the limit  all of mankind has been involved  at one time or another  in extending the boundaries of their territory   edit  Mobility Further information  Economic mobility  Social mobility For most of its history  especially from the mid 19th to early 20th centuries  the United States has been known as the  land of opportunity   and in this sense  it prided and promoted itself on providing individuals with the opportunity to escape from the contexts of their class and family background  39  Examples of this social mobility include  Occupational children could easily choose careers which were not based upon their parents  choices  40  Physical that geographical location was not seen as static  and citizens often relocated freely over long distances without barrier  41  Status As in most countries  family standing and riches were often a means to remain in a higher social circle  America was notably unusual due to an accepted wisdom that anyone from impoverished immigrants upwards who worked hard  could aspire to similar standing  regardless of circumstances of birth  This aspiration is commonly called living the American dream  Birth circumstances generally were not taken as a social barrier to the upper echelons or to high political status in American culture  This stood in contrast to other countries where many higher offices were socially determined  and usually hard to enter without being born into the suitable social group  42  However  social mobility in the US is lower than in a number of European Union countries if defined in terms of income movements  American men born into the lowest income quintile are much more likely to stay there compared to similar men in the Nordic countries or the United Kingdom  43  Many economists  such as Harvard economist N  Gregory Mankiw  however  state that the discrepancy has little to do with class rigidity  rather  it is a reflection of income disparity   Moving up and down a short ladder is a lot easier than moving up and down a tall one   44   edit  21st century opposition During the George W  Bush administration  the term was somewhat abstracted from its historical context  45  Proponents and opponents alike began using it to describe a phenomenon wherein certain political interests view the United States as being  above  or an  exception  to the law  specifically the Law of Nations  46   This phenomenon is less concerned with justifying American uniqueness than with asserting its immunity to international law   This new use of the term has served to confuse the topic and muddy the waters  since its unilateralist emphasis and historical orientation diverge somewhat from older uses of the term  A certain number of those who subscribe to  old style  or  traditional American exceptionalism  the idea that America is a more nearly exceptional nation than are others  that it differs qualitatively from the rest of the world and has a special role to play in world history also agree that the United States is and ought to be fully subject to and bound by the public international law  Indeed  recent research shows that  there is some indication for American exceptionalism among the  U S   public  but very little evidence of unilateral attitudes   47  Marilyn B  Young argues that after the end of the Cold War in 1991  neoconservative intellectuals and policymakers embraced the idea of an  American empire   a national mission to establish freedom and democracy in other nations  particularly underdeveloped ones  She argues that after 9 11 the George W  Bush administration reoriented foreign policy to an insistence on maintaining the supreme military and economic power of America  an attitude that harmonized with this new vision of American empire  Young says the Iraq War  2003 2011  exemplified American exceptionalism  48  In April 2009  Barack Obama responded to a journalist s question in Strasbourg with the statement   I believe in American exceptionalism  just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism   49  In the same response  Obama noted that  I see no contradiction between believing that America has a continued extraordinary role in leading the world towards peace and prosperity and recognizing that that leadership is incumbent  depends on  our ability to create partnerships because we create partnerships because we can t solve these problems alone   50   edit  Ignorance of aspects Critics on the left such as Marilyn Young and Howard Zinn have argued that American history is so morally flawed  citing slavery  civil rights and social welfare issues  that it cannot be an exemplar of virtue  51  Zinn argues that American exceptionalism cannot be of divine origin because it was not benign  especially when dealing with Native Americans  52  Dartmouth professor Donald E  Pease defined  American exceptionalism  as a  state fantasy  and a  myth  in his 2009 book The New American Exceptionalism  53  Pease notes that  state fantasies cannot altogether conceal the inconsistencies they mask   showing how such events as the revelations of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib and the exposure of government incompetence after Hurricane Katrina  opened fissures in the myth of exceptionalism   53  American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr argued that the automatic assumption  that America acts for the good  will bring about moral corruption  However Niebuhr did support the nation s Cold War policies  His position  called  Christian Realism   advocated a liberal notion of responsibility that justified interference in other nations  54   edit  Double standards U S  historians like Thomas Bender  try and put an end to the recent revival of American exceptionalism  a defect he esteems to be inherited from the Cold War   55  Gary W  Reichard and Ted Dickson argue  how the development of the United States has always depended on its transactions with other nations for commodities  cultural values and populations   56 Roger Cohen asks   How exceptional can you be when every major problem you face  from terrorism to nuclear proliferation to gas prices  requires joint action   57 Harold Koh distinguishes  distinctive rights  different labels  the  flying buttress  mentality  and double standards         T he fourth face double standards presents the most dangerous and destructive form of American exceptionalism   58 Godfrey Hodgson also concludes that  the US national myth is dangerous   59 Samantha Power asserts that  we re neither the shining example  nor even competent meddlers  It s going to take a generation or so to reclaim American exceptionalism   60 David F  Gordon argues that  we no longer have the power  we no longer have the resources  We are trying to make understand the fact that America is no longer a superpower   61   edit  The Americanist heresy Pope Leo XIII  who denounced what he deemed to be the heresy of americanism in the encyclical Testem Benevolentiae Nostrae  62  was arguably referring to American exceptionalism in the ecclesiastical domain  when it is specifically applied to the teachings of Christianity and the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church  63  64  At the end of the 19th century  there was definitely a tendency among the Roman Catholic clergy in the United States to view American society as inherently different from other Christian nations and societies  and to argue that the entire understanding of Church doctrine had to be redrawn in order to meet the requirements of what is known as the American Experience  which supposedly included greater individualism  civil rights  the inheritance of the American revolution  Anglo Saxon cultural traditions  economic liberalism  political reformism and egalitarianism  and Church State separation   edit  Pre emptive declinism Herbert London has defined pre emptive declinism as a postmodern belief  that the United States is not an exceptional nation and is not entitled by virtue of history to play a role on the world stage different from other nations   65  London ascribed the view to Paul Krugman  among others  66  Krugman had written in The New York Times that  We ve always known that America s reign as the world s greatest nation would eventually end  But most of us imagined that our downfall  when it came  would be something grand and tragic   66  According to RealClearPolitics  declarations of America s declining power have been common in the English language media  In 1988  Flora Lewis sighed that  Talk of U S  decline is real in the sense that the U S  can no longer pull all the levers of command or pay all the bills   According to Anthony Lewis in 1990  Europeans and Asians are already finding confirmation of their suspicion that the United States is in decline   Citing America s dependence on foreign sources for energy and  crucial weaknesses  in the military  Tom Wicker concluded  that maintaining superpower status is becoming more difficult nearly impossible for the United States   67  In 2004  Pat Buchanan lamented  the decline and fall of the greatest industrial republic the world had ever seen   68  In 2007  Matthew Parris of The Sunday Times in London wrote that the United States is  overstretched   romantically recalling the Kennedy presidency  when  America had the best arguments  and could use moral persuasion rather than force to have its way in the world  From his vantage point in Shanghai  the International Herald Tribune s Howard French worries about  the declining moral influence of the United States  over an emergent China  67  In his book  The Post American World  Newsweek editor Fareed Zakaria refers to a  Post American world  that he says   is not about the decline of America  but rather about the rise of everyone else   69  A 2011 poll by Generation Opportunity found that 56  of Millennials supported the notion that the U S  is qualitatively different from other nations  70   edit  Similarities between the United States and Europe In December 2009  historian Peter Baldwin published a book arguing that  despite widespread attempts to contrast the  American way of life  and the  European social model   America and Europe are actually very similar on a number of social and economic indices  Baldwin claimed that the black underclass accounts for many of those few areas where a stark difference exists between the US and Europe  such as homicide and child poverty  71  However  critic Andrew Moravcsik alleged that some of Baldwin s evidence actually supports the stereotype of a distinctive American model  a free market system with little labor protection  an adversarial legal system  high murder rates  high rates of gun ownership  a large prison population  inequitable and expensive health care  and relatively widespread poverty  72   edit  See also American civil religion Americanization  immigration  Americentrism Anti Americanism Chauvinism Criticism of American
