silver    La Plata Basin does not have any sources of silver  but the first Spanish conquerors arrived to the area following rumors of the existence of silver mountains  hence the name  The first use of the name Argentina can be traced to the 1602 poem La Argentina y conquista del R o de la Plata  Argentina and the conquest of the river of silver  by Mart n del Barco Centenera  Although this name for the La Plata Basin was already in common usage by the 18th century  the area was formally called Viceroyalty of the R o de la Plata in 1776  The autonomous governments that emerged from the 1810 May Revolution replaced  Viceroyalty  with  United Provinces   3  One of the first prominent uses of the demonym  Argentine  was in the 1812 first Argentine National Anthem  which made reference to the ongoing Argentine War of Independence  The first formal use of the name was in the 1826 constitution  which used both the terms  Argentine Republic  and  Argentine Nation   12  The Constitution was repealed  and the territories were instead known as the  Argentine Confederation   This name was used in the 1853 Constitution  being changed to that of the  Argentine Nation  in 1859  and to the  Argentine Republic  per an 1860 decree  when the country achieved its current organization  Nevertheless  the names of the  United Provinces of the R o de la Plata    Argentine Republic  and  Argentine Confederation  are acknowledged as legitimate names of the country  1  3  History Main article  History of Argentina Early history Cueva de las Manos  over 10 000 years old  is among the oldest evidence of indigenous culture in the Americas  The earliest evidence of humans in Argentina dates from 11 000 BC and was found in Patagonia  Piedra Museo  Santa Cruz   These finds were of the Diaguitas  Huarpes  and Sanavirones indigenous peoples  among others  The Inca Empire  under Sapa Inca Pachacutec  invaded and conquered present day north western Argentina in 1480  a feat usually attributed to T pac Inca Yupanqui  The tribes of Omaguacas  Atacamas  Huarpes and Diaguitas were defeated and integrated into a region called Collasuyu  Others  such as the Sanavirones  Lule Tonocot   and Comechingones  resisted the Incas and remained independent from them  The Guaran  developed a culture based on yuca  sweet potato  and yerba mate  The central and southern areas  Pampas and Patagonia  were dominated by nomadic cultures  the most populous among them being the Mapuches  13  The Atacaman settlement of Tastil in the north had an estimated population of 2 000 people  the highest populated area in pre Columbian Argentina  The most advanced indigenous populations were the Charr as and Guaran es  who developed some basic agriculture and the use of pottery  Most of their population was located in other South American sites  however  and their presence in the territory of modern Argentina was scarce by comparison  14  Colonial period See also  Colonial Argentina William Carr Beresford surrenders to Santiago de Liniers at the end of the first of the British invasions of the R o de la Plata  The first European explorer  Juan D az de Sol s  arrived to the R o de la Plata in 1516  Spain established the Viceroyalty of Peru in 1542  encompassing all its holdings in South America  Their first settlement in modern Argentina was the fort of Sancti Spiritu  established in 1527 next to the Paran  River  Buenos Aires  a permanent colony  was established in 1536 but was destroyed by natives  The city was established again in 1580  The colonization of modern Argentina came from 3 different directions  from Paraguay  establishing the Governorate of the R o de la Plata  from Peru and from Chile  15  The Spanish society in the Americas was organized in a system of castas  The European born Spanish peninsulars were at the top of the social hierarchy  as were the people from other European countries  The Spanish born in the Americas were known as criollos  Most natives stayed away from the Spanish cities  and the Spaniards brought African slaves as well  The relations of peoples from different castas  in most cases  male Spaniards and female natives  generated the mestizos  Most of them lived in the countryside  and became the Argentine gauchos  16  Buenos Aires became the capital of the Viceroyalty of the R o de la Plata in 1776  with territories from the Viceroyalty of Peru  Buenos Aires and Montevideo resisted two ill fated British invasions in 1806 and 1807  The resistance was headed both times by the French Santiago de Liniers  who would become viceroy through popular support  The ideas of the Age of Enlightenment and the example of the Atlantic Revolutions generated criticism to the Absolute monarchy  The overthrow of the Spanish King Ferdinand VII during the Peninsular War created great concern in the Americas  so many cities deposed the monarchic authorities and apppointed new ones  working under the new political ideas  This started the Spanish American wars of independence across the continent  Buenos Aires deposed the viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros in 1810  during the May Revolution  17  Independence and civil wars See also  Argentine War of Independence and Argentine Civil Wars Jos  de San Mart n  Liberator of Argentina  Chile and Peru The May Revolution began the Argentine War of Independence between patriots and royalists  The Primera Junta  the new government in Buenos Aires  sent military campaigns to C rdoba  Upper Peru and Paraguay  and supported the rebellions at the Banda Oriental  The military campaigns were defeated and colonial Brazil supported the royalists at Montevideo  so Buenos Aires signed an armistice  18  Paraguay stayed Non interventionist during the remainder of the conflict  Upper Peru defeated further military campaigns  and the Banda Oriental would be captured by William Brown during renewed hostilities  The national organization  either under a centralized government located in Buenos Aires or as a federation  began the Argentine Civil Wars as well  with the conflicts of Buenos Aires and Jos  Gervasio Artigas  19  The Argentine Declaration of Independence was issued by the Congress of Tucum n in 1816  Mart n Miguel de G emes kept royalists at bay on the North  while Jos  de San Mart n made the Crossing of the Andes  securing the independence of Chile  With the Chilean navy at his disposal he then took the fight to the royalist stronghold of Lima  San Mart n s military campaigns complemented those of Sim n Bol var in Gran Colombia and led to the independent s victory in the Spanish American wars of independence  20  Historical statesin present dayArgentina   before 1500 Inca Empire  1438 1533  Indigenous peoples in

Federalists  resulted in the end of the centralized national authority and created a power vacuum  A new constitution was enacted in 1826  during the War with Brazil  and Bernardino Rivadavia was appointed the first President of Argentina  This constitution was soon rejected by the provinces  due to its centralist bias  and Rivadavia resigned shortly after  The new governor Manuel Dorrego was deposed and executed by Juan Lavalle  which exacerbated the civil war  Juan Manuel de Rosas  who was so far a mere rancher  organized the resistance against Lavalle and restored the deposed authorities  The provinces then reorganized themselves as the Argentine Confederation  a loose confederation of provinces that lacked a common head of state  They would instead delegate some important powers to the governor of Buenos Aires Province  such as debt payment or the management of international relations  21  Juan Manuel de Rosas ruled from 1829 to 1832  and from 1835 to 1852  During his first term he convened the Federal pact and defeated the Unitarian League  After 1835 he received the  Sum of public power   He faced several unitarian attacks and a constant state of war  including a French blockade from 1838 to 1840  the War of the Confederation in the north  an Anglo French blockade from 1845 to 1850  and the Corrientes province revolt  Rosas remained undefeated during this series of conflicts and prevented further loss of national territory  His refusal to enact a national constitution  pursuant to the Federal pact  led to Entre R os governor Justo Jos  de Urquiza to turn against Rosas  He defeated him at the battle of Caseros  forcing him into exile  The San Nicol s Agreement followed  and then the promulgation of the Constitution of Argentina of 1853  Rejecting it  Buenos Aires seceded from the Confederation and became the State of Buenos Aires  The war between both lasted nearly a decade  and ended with the victory of Buenos Aires at the battle of Pav n  22  Buenos Aires rejoined the Confederation  and Bartolom  Mitre was elected the first president of the unified country in 1862  Mitre began military campaigns against both the remaining federals in Argentina  the whites from Uruguay  and Paraguay  The War of the Triple Alliance  in alliance with Uruguay and Brazil  left over 300 000 dead and devastated Paraguay  23  Unable to influence the election of later presidents  Domingo Faustino Sarmiento and Nicol s Avellaneda followed him  Albeit unitarians  they were not from Buenos Aires  and had conflicts with him  Mitre attempted twice to secede Buenos Aires from the country once more  but failed  Avellaneda proposed the federalization of Buenos Aires  which was resisted in the city  and the national seat of government was temporarily moved to Belgrano  which was not part of Buenos Aires by then   The military conflict ended with the victory of the national army and the federalization of the city  24  Since the colonial times  huge territories were under the control of indigenous peoples  All governments since then attempted in some way to stay in good terms  kill them  or push them to ever farther frontiers  The final conflict was the Conquest of the Desert  waged by Julio Argentino Roca  With this military operation  Argentina seized the control of the Patagonia  25  Rise of Peronism See also  Argentina in World War II and Peronism Hip lito Yrigoyen  first president elected with universal male suffrage  The bases of modern Argentina were established by the Generation of  80  a political movement that opposed Mitre and sought to industrialize the country  A wave of European immigration led to the strengthening of a cohesive state  the development of modern agriculture and to a near reinvention of Argentine society and economy  The country emerged as one of the ten richest countries in the world  benefiting from an agricultural export led economy as well as British and French investment  Driven by immigration and decreasing mortality the Argentine population grew fivefold and the economy 15 fold  26  However  the National Autonomist Party  PAN  could not meet its original goals of industrialization  and the country stayed as a pre industrial society  27  President Julio Roca was followed by Miguel  ngel Ju rez Celman  from the PAN as well  Ju rez Celman faced an economic crisis that generated popular discontent  this caused the Revolution of the Park in 1890  led by the Civic Union  With the resignation of Mitre  the Civic Union became the Radical Civic Union  UCR   Although the Coup d  tat failed  Celman resigned from the presidency  starting the decline of the PAN  Conservative  lites dominated Argentine politics until 1912  when President Roque S enz Pe a enacted universal male suffrage and the secret ballot  This allowed the UCR to win the country s first free elections in 1916  President Hip lito Yrigoyen enacted social and economic reforms and extended assistance to family farmers and small businesses  Argentina stayed neutral during World War I  28  Juan Per n and his influential wife  Eva  The second administration of Yrigoyen faced a huge economic crisis  influenced by the international Great Depression  The military made a coup d  tat and ousted him from power  which began the Infamous Decade  Jos  F lix Uriburu led the military rule for two years  calling to elections in 1931  The UCR prevailed  so the elections were annulled  Agust n Pedro Justo was elected with electoral fraud  who signed the Roca Runciman Treaty  Justo was followed by Roberto Mar a Ortiz  who got diabetes and got replaced by his vicepresident  Ram n Castillo  World War II began during the presidency of Ortiz  who stayed neutral  as well as Castillo  Britain supported the Argentine neutrality  but after the attack on Pearl Harbor the United States requested all of South America to join the Allied Nations  in order to generate a continent wide resistance  Castillo was finally deposed by the Revolution of  43  a new military coup that wanted to end the electoral fraud of the last decade  Argentina declared war to the Axis Powers a month before the end of World War II in Europe  The minister of welfare of the military  Juan Per n  became highly popular among workers  He was fired and jailed  but a massive demonstration forced his liberation  Per n run for the presidency in 1946  and won by the 53 1   29  Juan Per n created a political movement known as Peronism  Taking advantage of the import substitution industrialization and the European devastation left by the immediate aftermath of World War II  he nationalized strategic industries and services  improved wages and working conditions  paid the full external debt and achieved nearly full employment  The economy  however  began to decline in 1950  The constitution was amended in 1949  adding new rights to the workers  Per n intensified censorship as well as repression  110 publications were shuttered  30  and numerous opposition figures were imprisoned and tortured  31  His wife Eva Per n was highly popular and played a central political role  mostly through the Eva Per n Foundation and the Female Peronist Party  as women s suffrage was granted in 1947  32  However  her declining health did not allow her to run for the vice presidency in 1951  and she died of cancer the following year  The military began to plot against Per n in 1955  and bombed the Plaza de Mayo in an ill fated attempt to kill him  A few months later  Per n resigned during a new military coup  which established the Revoluci n Libertadora  Per n left the country  and finally settled in Spain  33  The Dirty War See also  Dirty War Arturo Frondizi  right  and his chief economic adviser  Rogelio Frigerio  whose policies promoted greater self sufficiency in energy and industry  Eduardo Lonardi  head of the military government  tried to maintain a good relation with Peronism  The more intransigent factions of the military prevailed  replaced Lonardi with Pedro Eugenio Aramburu  and proscribed all manifestations of Peronism  even to reference Juan Per n by his name   Peronism  however  did not disappear  as Peronists kept being organized in informal associations  A group of military attempt a coup on 9 June 1956  to restore Peronism to power  but the government defeat them  The 1949 amendment of the Constitution is repealed  restoring the one from 1853  but the elections for the Constituent Assembly got a majority of blank votes because of the Peronist proscription  Arturo Frondizi from the UCR became popular by opposing the military rule  and got elected in the following elections  34  Frondizi enjoyed some support from Peronism  which was still proscripted  but allowed him to prevail in the elections  The military  however  was reluctant to allow Peronism to influence the new government  and allowed him to take power but conditioned to stay aligned with them  Thus  The military frequently interfered on behalf of conservative  agrarian interests however  and the results were mixed  26  His policies encouraged investment to make the country self sufficient in energy and industry  helping reverse a chronic trade deficit for Argentina  His efforts to stay in good terms with both Peronists and the military  without fully supporting either one  earned him the distrust and rejection of both  The 1960 legislative election ended again with a majority of blank votes  Frondizi attempted to mediate between the United States and Cuba  and received the Che Guevara  a leader of the Cuban Revolution  in Argentina  which further infuriated the military  Argentina broke relations with Cuba after the United States embargo  which increased his popular rejection  Frondizi lifted the Peronist proscription  leading to a Peronist victory at several provinces  rejected by the military  A new coup ousted Frondizi from power  but a swift reaction by Jos  Mar a Guido  president of the Senate  applied the laws related to power vacuum and became president instead of the military  The elections were repealed and Peronism proscripted again  Arturo Illia was elected in 1963 and enacted expansionist policies but  despite prosperity  his attempts to include Peronists in the political process resulted in the armed forces retaking power in a new coup in 1966  The Argentine Revolution  the new military government  sought to rule in Argentina indefinitely  35  The new military Junta appointed Juan Carlos Ongan a as president  He closed the Congress  banned all political parties and dismantled all students  unions  The students  protests were repressed during the Night of the Long Batons  Many worker unions were dismantled as well  Popular discontent led to two massive protests  the Cordobazo in C rdoba and the Rosariazo in Rosario  Ongan a was replaced by Roberto M  Levingston  and shortly after there was a huge political commotion with the kidnapping and execution of the former de facto president Aramburu  The crime was committed by the Montoneros  who  along with the People s Revolutionary Army  ERP   began a Guerrilla warfare against the military  the Dirty War  Levingston was then replaced by Alejandro Agust n Lanusse  who began negotiations to return to democracy and end the proscription held over peronism  Initially  he sought to allow Peronism but not the return of Juan Per n himself  who was living in Spain   so the agreement had a clause so that the presidential candidates should be in Argentina since 25 August  Thus  the Peronist candidate was not Per n but H ctor Jos  C mpora  who won the elections by the 49 59   36  Poster from the Madres de la Plaza de Mayo NGO  with photos of the disappeared  The return of Peronism to power saw violent disputes between its internal factions  right wing union leaders and left wing young peoples from montoneros  The return of Per n to the country generated an armed conflict  the Ezeiza massacre  Overwhelmed by the political violence  C mpora and his vice president resigned  promoting new elections so Per n could become president  Per n was elected  with his wife Isabel as vice president  but before taking office the Montoneros murdered the union leader Jos  Ignacio Rucci  with close ties to Per n  They thought that Per n would consider them a force to be reckoned  but rather than that  he ended all relations with them  He expulsed them from Plaza de Mayo and from the party  and they became once again a clandestine organization  Jos  L pez Rega  secretary of Per n  organized the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance  AAA  to fight against them and the ERP  Per n died shortly after  and his wife took office  The AAA maintained the operations against the guerrillas  which increased their power  The Operativo Independencia stopped an attempt to capture and secede territories of Tucum n  A decree ordered the military to  annihilate the subversion   The military made another coup d  tat  in March 1976  37  The Junta announced a National Reorganization Process  hence the name given to it  It closed the Congress  removed the members of the Supreme Court  and banned political parties  unions  student s unions  etc  It also intensified measures against ERP and Montoneros  who had kidnapped and murdered people almost weekly since 1970  38  The military resorted to forced disappearance of suspected members of the guerrillas  and began to prevail in the war  The looses of Montoneros by the end of 1976 were near 2000  The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo denounced the forced disappearances  The Junta tried to be popular by promoting nationalism  with the Beagle conflict and the 1978 FIFA World Cup  As of 1977  the ERP was completely defeated  Montoneros was severely weakened  but launched a massive counterattack in 1979  It was defeated  ending the guerrilla threat  However  the military Junta stayed in government  Leopoldo Galtieri launched the Falklands War  Spanish  Guerra de Malvinas   attempting to recover the islands  but he was defeated by the United Kingdom within two months  Galtieri left the government because of the military defeat  and Reynaldo Bignone began to organize the transition to a new democratic rule  with the free elections in 1983  39  Contemporary era See also  Argentine economic crisis  1999 2002  and Kirchnerism Carlos Menem  right  receives the Presidential sash from Ra l Alfons n  left  in 1989  This was the first democratic transfer of power between opposing political parties in Argentina since 1916  In the 1983 electoral campaign Alfons n called to national unity  restoration of democratic rule and prosecution of the responsibles of the dirty war  Peronism lost free national elections for the first time  He established the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons  CONADEP  to investigate the forced disappearances  The CONADEP generated a report detailing 340 centers of illegal detentions and 8961 forced disappearenced  The 1985 Trial of the Juntas sentenced all the heads of government of those years  The Beagle conflict ended by that time  with a referendum where the 81  of the country supported the proposed agreement  With the heads of the Junta condemned  Alfons n aimed to the military of lower ranks  but the discontent among the military and the risk of a new coup increased  To please them  he issued the full stop law  which established a deadline for new trials  This did not work as intended  and the Carapintadas mutinied  forcing the law of Due Obedience that exempted the military that followed orders from superior ranks  This lowered the public support to the government  as well as an economic crisis that led to an hyperinflation  The Peronist Carlos Menem won the 1989 elections  but huge riots caused by the economic crisis forced Alfons n to resign  handing government to Menem  40  Carlos Menem led a change in Peronism  which declined its usual politics  and embraced neoliberalism instead  Initially  Menem was unable to control the inflation  but a fixed exchange rate established in 1991  the dismantling of protectionist barriers  business regulations and several privatizations normalized the economy for a time  His presidency had high levels of perceived political corruption  but kept a high positive image anyway  There were two great terrorist attacks  against the Israeli embassy in 1992 and the AMIA in 1994  His victories at the 1991 and 1993 elections led to the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution  which allowed him to run for a second term  He was reelected  but the economy began to decline in 1996  with higher unemployment and recession  He lost the 1997 elections  and the UCR returned to the presidency in the 1999 elections  41  President Fernando de la R a sought to change the political style of Menem  but kept his economic plan regardless of the growing recession  However  a few months later the Congress issues a new labour law  and many senators were accused of receiving briberies to vote for the law  The ensuing scandal led to the resignation of vice president Chacho  lvarez and other members of the cabinet  De la R a appointed Ricardo L pez Murphy as minister of economy  who detailed a plan of fiscal austerity to solve the economic crisis  Huge protests forced him to resign in a few days  without implementing such plan  He was replaced by Domingo Cavallo  who had already been minister of economy during the presidency of Menem  The Congress delegated as well some legislative powers on the president  to help a swift solution to the crisis  The social discontent led to the appearance of piqueteros  unemployed people that block streets or roads to voice protests  The popular discontent with the political parties  both the UCR and the PJ  was manifested in the 2001 legislative elections  both parties received less than a million votes each in comparison with the 1999 elections  and the blank  protest votes and abstensions rose to 48   A huge capital flight was responded to with a freezing of bank accounts  generating further discontent  Several riots in the country led the president to establish a state of emergency  received with more popular protests  The huge riots in December finally forced De la R a to resign  42  N stor Kirchner with his wife and successor  Cristina Fern ndez de Kirchner  upon her inaugural in 2007  Adolfo Rodr guez Sa  was appointed president by the Legislative Assembly  but further riots forced him to resign as well in a few days  Eduardo Duhalde was appointed then  and derogated the fixed exchange rate established by Menem  The economic crisis began to end by the late 2002  under the management of the minister of Economy Roberto Lavagna  The death of two piqueteros caused a political scandal that forced Duhalde to call to elections earlier  Carlos Menem got the 24 36  of the votes  followed by N stor Kirchner with the 22   Kirchner was largely unknown by the people  but would maintain Lavagna as minister  However  Menem declined to run for the required ballotage  which made Kirchner the new president  43  Following the economic policies laid by Duhalde and Lavagna  Kirchner ended the economic crisis  getting fiscal and trade surpluses  However  he distanced from Duhalde once getting to power  He promoted as well the reopening of judicial actions against the crimes of the Dirty War  During his administration  Argentina restructured its defaulted debt with a steep discount  about 66   on most bonds  paid off debts with the International Monetary Fund and nationalized some previously privatized enterprises  He did not run for a reelection  promoting instead the candidacy of his wife Cristina Fern ndez de Kirchner  44  45  The presidency of Cristina Kirchner began with a conflict with the agricultural sector  caused by an attempt to increase the taxes over exports to high levels  The conflict was taken to the Congress  and vice president Julio Cobos gave an unexpected tie breaking vote against the bill  N stor Kirchner run for a deputee candidature in 2009  being defeated  The government increased its political radicalism and waged several controversies with the press  limiting the freedom of speech  46  47  On 15 July 2010  Argentina became the first country in Latin America and the second country in the Southern Hemisphere to legalize same sex marriage  48  49  N stor Kirchner died in 2010  and Cristina Fern ndez was reelected in 2011  50

every other year  A third of the candidates presented by the parties must be women  The president serves a four year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice in a row  58  The president is elected by direct vote  The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature  The Supreme Court has seven members appointed by the President in consultation with the Senate  The judges of all the other courts are appointed by the Council of Magistrates of the Nation  a secretariat composed of representatives of judges  lawyers  the Congress and the executive  59  The Supreme Court  head of the judiciary  The provincial governments must be representative republics and may not contradict the national constitution and national laws  but beyond that  each province is allowed to have its own constitution and organize their local government as desired  60  For example  some provinces have bicameral provincial legislatures  while others have unicameral ones  Buenos Aires is not a province but a federal district  but its local organization has similarities with the provinces  it has a local constitution  an elected mayor and representatives to the Senate and the Chamber of deputies  The national government reserved control of the Argentine Federal Police  the federally administered city force   the Port of Buenos Aires  and other faculties  however  61  Foreign policy Main article  Foreign relations of Argentina The President of Brazil  Dilma Rousseff  left   in a press conference with President Cristina Fern ndez de Kirchner  right   Argentina is a full member of the Mercosur block together with Brazil  Paraguay and Uruguay  Since 2002 Argentina has emphasized the role of Latin American integration and the bloc  which has some supranational legislative functions  as its first international priority  62  Argentina is a founding signatory and permanent consulting member of the Antarctic Treaty System and the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat is based in Buenos Aires  63  Argentina is also a full member of the Union of South American Nations  The former president of Argentina N stor Kirchner was the first Secretary General of this organization  Argentina is part of the G 20 as well  Argentina claims sovereignty over the Falkland Islands  Spanish  Islas Malvinas   and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands  which are administered by the United Kingdom as British Overseas Territories  as well as almost 1 000 000 square kilometres  390 000 sq mi  in Antarctica  between 25 W and 74 W and south of 60 S  The Antarctic claim overlaps claims by Chile and the United Kingdom  though all claims to Antarctica fall under the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty  Since 1904  a scientific post has been maintained in Antarctica by mutual agreement  64  Argentina was the only Latin American country to participate in the 1991 Gulf War under the United Nations mandate  and played an important role in Operation Uphold Democracy  in Haiti  65  Argentina has contributed worldwide to peacekeeping operations  including those in El Salvador  Honduras  Nicaragua  Guatemala  the Ecuador Peru dispute  Western Sahara  Angola  Kuwait  Cyprus  Croatia  Kosovo  Bosnia and Timor Leste  In recognition of its contributions to international security  U S  President Bill Clinton designated Argentina as a major non NATO ally in January 1998  It was last elected as a member of the UN Security Council in 2005  The United Nations White Helmets  a bulwark of peacekeeping and humanitarian aid efforts  were first deployed in 1994 following an Argentine initiative  66  Military Main article  Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic The armed forces of Argentina comprise an army  navy and air force  and number about 70 000 active duty personnel  one third fewer than levels before the return to democracy in 1983  67  The President is commander in chief of the armed forces  with the Defense Ministry exercising day to day control  There are also two other forces  the Naval Prefecture  which patrols Argentine territorial waters  and the National Gendarmerie  which patrols the border regions   both arms are controlled by the Interior Ministry but maintain liaison with the Defense Ministry  The age for enlistment in the volunteer military is from 16 to 23 years old  68  Historically  Argentina s military has been one of the best equipped in the region  for example  developing its own jet fighters as early as the 1950s   69  but recently it has faced sharper expenditure cutbacks than most other Latin American armed forces  Real military expenditures declined steadily after 1981 and though there have been recent increases  the defense budget is now around US 3 billion  70  The armed forces are currently participating in major peacekeeping operations in Haiti  Cyprus  Western Sahara and the Middle East  71  Provinces Main article  Provinces of Argentina Argentina is composed of twenty three provinces and one autonomous city  Buenos Aires  The administrative divisions of the Provinces are the departments  and the municipalities  except for Buenos Aires Province  which is divided into partidos  The City of Buenos Aires is divided into communes  The provinces are organized as a federation  each one with a local constitution  72  They hold all the power which is not specifically delegated to the national government  73  During the Argentine War of Independence the main cities and their surrounding countrysides became provinces  though the intervention of their cabildos  The anarchy of the year XX completed this process  shaping the original thirteen provinces  Jujuy seceded from Salta in 1834  and the thirteen provinces became fourteen  After seceding for a decade  Buenos Aires accepted the Constitution of Argentina of 1853 in 1860  Buenos Aires was made a federal territory in 1880  72  A 1862 law determined that the territories under control of Argentina but outside the frontiers of the provinces would be called national territories  This allowed in 1884 to establish the governorates of Misiones  Formosa  Chaco  La Pampa  Neuqu n  R  Negro  Chubut  Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego  The agreement about a frontier dispute with chile in 1900 created the national territory of Los Andes  whose territories were incorporated into Jujuy  Salta and Catamarca in 1943  72  La Pampa and Chaco became provinces in 1951  Misiones did so in 1953  and Formosa  Neuqu n  R o Negro  Chubut and Santa Cruz in 1955  The last national territory  Tierra del Fuego  became a province in 1990  72  The Quinto River establishes part of the limit between Buenos Aires and La Pampa  but the presence of canals made a slight change in the path of the river  This led to a territorial dispute between the provinces  solved in 1984  Buenos Aires disputed as well the Lechiguanas islands with Entre R os  and it was ruled that the deepest point of the rivers  used to establish the exact international limits  would be used to establish provincial limits as well  Thus  the islands became part of Entre R os  73  Geography Main article  Geography of Argentina Topographic map of Argentina The total surface area  excluding the Antarctic claim  is 2 791 810 km2  1 077 920 sq mi   3  Argentina has six main regions  Gran Chaco  Mesopotamia  the Pampas  Patagonia  Cuyo and the Norwest  The Pampas are fertile lowlands located in the center and east  The Mesopotamia is a lowland enclosed by the Paran  and Uruguay rivers  and the Gran Chaco is between the mesopotamia and the Andes  Cuyo is at the east side of the Andes mountain range  and the Argentine Northwest is at the North of it  The Patagonia is a large plateau to the South  74  The highest point above sea level is in Mendoza province at Cerro Aconcagua  6 959 m  22 831 ft    75  also the highest point in the Southern and Western Hemisphere  76  The lowest point is Laguna del Carb n in Santa Cruz province   105 m   344 ft

major rivers are the Paran   the largest   the Pilcomayo  Paraguay  Bermejo  Colorado  R o Negro  Salado and the Uruguay  The Paran  and the Uruguay join to form the R o de la Plata estuary  before reaching the Atlantic  Regionally important rivers are the Atuel and Mendoza in the homonymous province  the Chubut in Patagonia  the R o Grande in Jujuy and the San Francisco River in Salta  Mount Aconcagua  the highest outside the Himalayas  There are several large lakes including Argentino and Viedma in Santa Cruz  Nahuel Huapi between R o Negro and Neuqu n and Colhu  Huapi and Musters in Chubut  78 Lake Buenos Aires  O Higgins San Mart n Lake and Fagnano are shared with Chile  78 Mar Chiquita  C rdoba  is the largest salt water lake in the country  There are numerous reservoirs created by dams  Argentina features various hot springs  such as Termas de R o Hondo  which house the largest spa resort in South America  79  The 4 725 km  2 936 mi  long Atlantic coast 3  has been a popular local vacation area for over a century  and varies between areas of sand dunes and cliffs  The continental platform is unusually wide  this shallow area of the Atlantic is called the Argentine Sea  The waters are rich in fisheries and possibly hold important hydrocarbon energy resources  The two major ocean currents affecting the coast are the warm Brazil Current and the cold Falkland Current  Because of the unevenness of the coastal landmass  the two currents alternate in their influence on climate and do not allow temperatures to fall evenly with higher latitude  The southern coast of Tierra del Fuego forms the north shore of the Beagle Channel  80  Climate Main article  Climate of Argentina Upsala Glacier in Los Glaciares  Santa Cruz  South  and desert area in Talampaya  La Rioja  Northeast   The generally temperate climate ranges from subtropical in the north to subpolar in the far south  The north is characterized by very hot  humid summers with mild drier winters  and is subject to periodic droughts  81  Central Argentina has a temperate climate  with hot summers with thunderstorms  and cool winters  and higher moisture at the east  82  The southern regions have warm summers and cold winters with heavy snowfall  specially in mountainous zones  83  The hottest and coldest temperature extremes recorded in South America have occurred in Argentina  A record high temperature of 49 1  C  120 4  F   was recorded at Villa Mar a  C rdoba  on 2 January 1920  84  The lowest temperature recorded was  39  C   38 2  F  at Valle de los Patos Superior  San Juan  on 17 July 1972  84  Major wind currents include the cool Pampero Winds blowing on the flat plains of Patagonia and the Pampas  following the cold front  warm currents blow from the north in middle and late winter  creating mild conditions  82  The Zonda  a hot dry wind  affects west central Argentina  Squeezed of all moisture during the 6 000 m  19 685 ft  descent from the Andes  Zonda winds can blow for hours with gusts up to 120 km h  75 mph   fueling wildfires and causing damage  when the Zonda blows  June November   snowstorms and blizzard  viento blanco  conditions usually affect higher elevations  85  The Sudestada usually moderates cold temperatures but brings very heavy rains  rough seas and coastal flooding  It is most common in late autumn and winter along the central coast and in the R o de la Plata estuary  82  Biodiversity Main article  Environment of Argentina A Magellanic Penguin  Patagonic Region  and a coati  Mesopotamic Region   Subtropical plants dominate the Gran Chaco in the north  with the Dalbergia genus of trees well represented by Brazilian Rosewood and the quebracho tree  also predominant are white and black algarrobo trees  prosopis alba and prosopis nigra   Savannah like areas exist in the drier regions nearer the Andes  Aquatic plants thrive in the wetlands of Argentina  In central Argentina the humid pampas are a true tallgrass prairie ecosystem  The original pampa had virtually no trees  some imported species like the American sycamore or eucalyptus are present along roads or in towns and country estates  estancias   The only tree like plant native to the pampa is the evergreen Omb   The surface soils of the pampa are a deep black color  primarily mollisols  known commonly as humus  This makes the region one of the most agriculturally productive on Earth  however  this is also responsible for decimating much of the original ecosystem  to make way for commercial agriculture  The western pampas receive less rainfall  this dry pampa is a plain of short grasses or steppe  86  The national government maintains 29 national parks  87  Most of Patagonia lies within the rain shadow of the Andes  so the flora  shrubby bushes and plants  is suited to dry conditions  The soil is hard and rocky  making large scale farming impossible except along river valleys  Coniferous forests in far western Patagonia and on the island of Tierra del Fuego  include alerce  cipr s de la cordillera  cipr s de las guaitecas  huililahu n  lleuque  ma  o hembra and pehu n  while broadleaf trees include several species of Nothofagus such as coihue  lenga and  ire  Other introduced trees present in forestry plantations include spruce  cypress and pine  Common plants are the copihue and colihue  88  In Cuyo  semiarid thorny bushes and other xerophile plants abound  Along the many rivers grasses and trees grow in significant numbers  The area presents optimal conditions for the large scale growth of grape vines  In northwest Argentina there are many species of cactus  No vegetation grows in the highest elevations  above 4 000 m  13 000 ft   because of the extreme altitude  A Puma  Northwest  and a Southern right whale  Patagonia   Many species live in the subtropical north  Prominent animals include big cats like the jaguar  puma  and ocelot  primates  howler monkey   large reptiles  crocodiles   the Argentine Black and White Tegu and a species of caiman  Other animals include the tapir  peccary  capybara  bush dog  and various species of turtle and tortoise  There are a wide variety of birds  notably hummingbirds  flamingos  toucans  and swallows  The central grasslands are populated by the giant anteater  armadillo  pampas cat  maned wolf  mara  cavias  and the rhea   and    a large flightless bird  Hawks  falcons  herons  and tinamous  perdiz  Argentine  false partridges   inhabit the region  There are also pampas deer and pampas foxes  Some of these species extend into Patagonia  The western mountains are home to different animals  These include the llama  guanaco  vicu a  among the most recognizable species of South America  Also in this region are the fox  viscacha  Andean Mountain Cat  kodkod  and the largest flying bird in the New World  the Andean Condor  Southern Argentina is home to the cougar  huemul  pud   the world s smallest deer   and introduced  non native wild boar  88  The coast of Patagonia is rich in animal life  elephant seals  fur seals  sea lions and species of penguin  The far south is populated by cormorants  The territorial waters of Argentina have abundant ocean life  mammals such as dolphins  orcas  and whales like the southern right whale  a major tourist draw for naturalists  Sea fish include sardines  Argentine hakes  dolphinfish  salmon  and sharks  also present are squid and King crab  centolla  in Tierra del Fuego  Rivers and streams in Argentina have many species of trout and the South American golden dorado fish  Well known snake species inhabiting Argentina include boa constrictors and a very venomous pit viper named the yarar   The Hornero was elected the National Bird after a survey in 1928  89  Economy Main articles  Economy of Argentina  Agriculture in Argentina  Argentine foreign trade  and Tourism in Argentina Graphical depiction of Argentina s product exports in 28 color coded categories  Argentina has a market oriented economy with abundant natural resources  a well educated population  an export oriented agricultural sector and a relatively diversified industrial base  The nation s services sector accounts for around 59  of the economy and 72  of employment  manufacturing is 21  of GDP and 13  of employment  and agriculture is 9  of GDP  with 7  of employment  construction  mining  and public utilities divide the rest  90  91  Agriculture  including processed goods  provided 54  of export earnings in 2010  however  while industrial manufactures accounted for 35   energy staples and metal ores were most of the remainder   92  High inflation has been a weakness of the Argentine economy for decades  93  Officially hovering around 9  since 2006  inflation has been privately estimated at over 20   94  becoming a contentious issue again  The government has manipulated inflation statistics  95  The urban income poverty rate has dropped to 18  as of mid 2008  a third of the peak level observed in 2002  though still above the level prior to 1976  96  97 Income distribution  having improved since 2002  is still considerably unequal  98  99  Argentina ranks 105th out of 178 countries in the Transparency International s Corruption Perceptions Index for 2010  100  Reported problems include both government and private sector corruption  the latter of which include money laundering  trafficking in narcotics and contraband  and tax evasion  101  The Kirchner administration responded to the Global financial crisis of 2008 2009 with a record public works program  new tax cuts and subsidies  102  103  and the transfer of private pensions to the social security system  Private pension plans  which required growing subsidies to cover  were nationalized to shed a budgetary drain as well as to finance high government spending and debt obligations  104  105  Argentina has  after its neighbour Chile  the second highest Human Development Index  and the highest GDP per capita in purchasing power terms in Latin America  Argentina is one of the G 20 major economies  with the world s 27th largest nominal GDP  and the 22nd largest by purchasing power  The country is classified as upper middle income or a secondary emerging market by the World Bank  History See also  Economic history of Argentina The British financed docks and railway system created a dynamic agro export sector that remains as an economic pillar  Between 1860 and 1930  exploitation of the rich land of the pampas strongly pushed economic growth  106  During the first three decades of the 20th century  Argentina outgrew Canada and Australia in population  total income  and per capita income  106  By 1913  Argentina was the world s 10th wealthiest nation per capita  107  Beginning in the 1930s  however  the Argentine economy deteriorated notably  106  The single most important factor in this decline has been political instability since 1930  when a military junta took power  ending seven decades of civilian constitutional government  108  Successive governments from the 1930s to the 1970s pursued a strategy of import substitution to achieve industrial self sufficiency  but the government s encouragement of industrial growth diverted investment from agricultural production  which fell dramatically  109  The era of import substitution ended in 1976  but the same time growing government spending  large wage raises and inefficient production created a chronic inflation that rose through the 1980s  109  The measures enacted in 1976 also produced a huge foreign debt by the late 1980s  which became equivalent to three fourths of the GNP  109  In the early 1990s the government reined in inflation by making the peso equal in value to the U S  dollar  and privatized numerous state run companies  using part of the proceeds to reduce the national debt  109  However  a sustained recession at the turn of the 20th to 21st century culminated in a default  and the government again devalued the peso  109  By 2005  the economy had recovered  there was considerable GNP growth  renewed foreign investment  and a significant drop in the unemployment rate  109

Leloir  left  and his staff toast his 1970 Nobel Prize in Chemistry  Argentina has contributed many distinguished doctors  scientists and inventors to the world  including three Nobel Prize laureates in sciences  Argentines have been responsible for major breakthroughs in world medicine  their research has led to significant advances in wound healing therapies and in the treatment of heart disease and several forms of cancer  Domingo Liotta designed and developed the first artificial heart successfully implanted in a human being in 1969  Ren  Favaloro developed the techniques and performed the world s first ever coronary bypass surgery  and Francisco de Pedro invented a more reliable artificial cardiac pacemaker  SAC D satellite Bernardo Houssay  the first Latin American awarded with a Nobel Prize in the Sciences  discovered the role of pituitary hormones in regulating glucose in animals  C sar Milstein did extensive research in antibodies  Luis Leloir discovered how organisms store energy converting glucose into glycogen and the compounds which are fundamental in metabolizing carbohydrates  A team led by Alberto Taquini and Eduardo Braun Men ndez discovered angiotensin in 1939  and was the first to describe the enzymatic nature of the renin angiotensin system and its role in hypertension  110  The Leloir Institute of biotechnology is among the most prestigious in its field in Latin America and in the world  111  Dr  Luis Agote devised the first safe method of blood transfusion  Enrique Finochietto designed operating table tools such as the surgical scissors that bear his name   Finochietto scissors   and a surgical rib spreader  112  They have likewise contributed to bioscience in efforts like the Human Genome Project  where Argentine scientists have successfully mapped the genome of a living being  a world first  113  114  Argentina s nuclear program is highly advanced  having resulted in a research reactor in 1957 and Latin America s first on line commercial reactor in 1974  Argentina developed its nuclear program without being overly dependent on foreign technology  Nuclear facilities with Argentine technology have been built in Peru  Algeria  Australia and Egypt  In 1983  the country admitted having the capability of producing weapon grade uranium  a major step needed to assemble nuclear weapons  since then  however  Argentina has pledged to use nuclear power only for peaceful purposes  115  As a member of the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency  Argentina has been a strong voice in support of nuclear non

immigrants from Europe  129  Argentina was second only to the US in the numbers of European immigrants received and  at those times  the national population doubled every two decades  The majority of these European immigrants came from Italy and Spain  130  86 4  of Argentina s population self identify as being of European descent  An estimated 8  of the population is Mestizo and 4  of Argentines

guarantees freedom of religion but also requires the government to support Roman Catholicism economically  134  Until 1994 the President and Vice President had to be Roman Catholic  though there were no such restrictions on other government officials  although since 1945 members of other religious groups have held prominent posts  Catholic policy remains influential in government though  and still helps shape a variety of legislation  135  In a study assessing world wide levels of religious regulation and persecution  with scores ranging from 0 10 where 0 represented low levels of regulation or

Voseo  in a Buenos Aires billboard The de facto official language of Argentina is Spanish  usually called castellano  Castilian  by Argentines  Argentina is the largest Spanish speaking society that universally employs voseo  the use of the pronoun vos instead of t   you   which occasions the use of alternate verb forms as well   The most prevalent dialect is Rioplatense  whose speakers are primarily located in the R o de la Plata basin  Italian and other European immigrants influenced Lunfardo  the slang spoken in the R o de la Plata region  permeating the vernacular vocabulary of other regions as well  A phonetic study conducted by the Laboratory for Sensory Investigations of CONICET and the University of Toronto showed that the accent of the inhabitants of Buenos Aires  known as porte os  is closer to the Neapolitan language  spoken in Southern Italy  than any other spoken language  143  According to Ethnologue there are around 1 5 million Italian speakers  making it the second most spoken language in the country  and 1 million speakers of the North Levantine dialect of Arabic  spoken in Syria  Lebanon and Cyprus   144 Standard German is spoken by 400 000 500 000

literature since becoming a fully united entity in the 1850s  The struggle between the Federalists  who favored a loose confederation of provinces based on rural conservatism  and the Unitarians  pro liberalism and advocates of a strong central government that would encourage European immigration   set the tone for Argentine literature of the time  151  The ideological divide between gaucho epic Mart n Fierro by Jos  Hern ndez  and Facundo 152  by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento  is a great example  Hern ndez  a federalist  was opposed to the centralizing  modernizing and Europeanizing tendencies  Sarmiento wrote in support of immigration as the only way to save Argentina from becoming subject to the rule of a small number of dictatorial caudillo families  arguing such immigrants would make Argentina more modern and open to Western European influences and therefore a more prosperous society  153  Argentine literature of that period was fiercely nationalist  It was followed by the modernist movement  which emerged in France in the late 19th century  and this period in turn was followed by vanguardism  with Ricardo G iraldes as an important reference  Jorge Luis Borges  its most

represents the union of the provinces  came into use in 1813 as a seal for official documents  The Argentine National Anthem  adopted in 1813  was written by Vicente L pez y Planes with music by Blas

Education in Argentina After independence Argentina built a national public education system in comparison to other nations  placing the country high in the global rankings of literacy  Today Argentina has a literacy rate of 97   and three in eight adults over age 20 have completed secondary school studies or higher  96  The ubiquitous white uniform of Argentine school children is a national symbol of learning School attendance is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 17  The Argentine school system consists of an elementary or lower school level lasting six or seven years  and a secondary or high school level lasting between five to six years  In the 1990s  the system was split into different types of high school instruction  called Educacion Secundaria and the Polimodal  Some provinces adopted the Polimodal while others did not  A project in the executive branch to repeal this measure and return to a more traditional secondary level system was approved in 2006  184  President Domingo Faustino Sarmiento is credited with pushing for and implementing a free and modern education system in Argentina  The 1918 university reform shaped the current tripartite representation of most public universities  Education is funded by tax payers at all levels except for the majority of graduate studies  There are many private school institutions in the primary  secondary and university levels  Around 11 4 million people were enrolled in formal education of some kind in 2006  including 1 5 million in the nation s 85 universities  96  Public education in Argentina is tuition free from the elementary to the university levels  Though literacy was nearly universal as early as 1947  96  the majority of Argentine youth had little access to education beyond the compulsory seven years of grade school during the first half of the 20th century  since then  when the tuition free system was extended to the secondary and university levels  demand for these facilities has often outstripped budgets  particularly since the 1970s   185  Consequently  public education is now widely found wanting and in decline  this has helped private education flourish  though it has also caused a marked inequity between those who can afford it  usually the middle and upper classes  and the rest of society  as private schools often have no scholarship systems in place  Roughly one in four primary and secondary students and one in six university students attend private institutions  96  185  There are thirty eight public universities across the country  186  as well as numerous private ones  The University of Buenos Aires  Universidad Nacional de C rdoba  Universidad Nacional de La Plata  Universidad Nacional de Rosario  and the National Technological University are among the most important  Public universities faced cutbacks in spending during the 1980s and 1990s  which led to a decline in overall quality  Health care Main article  Health care in

labor union sponsored plans  Obras Sociales   government insurance plans  public hospitals and clinics and through private health insurance plans  Government efforts to improve public health can be traced to Spanish Viceroy Juan Jos  de V rtiz s first Medical Tribunal of 1780  188  Following independence  medical schools were established at the University of Buenos Aires  1822  and the National University of C rdoba  1877   The training of doctors and nurses at these and other schools enabled the rapid development of health care cooperatives  which during the presidency of Juan Per n became publicly subsidized Obras Sociales  Today  these number over 300  of which 200 are related to labor unions  and provide health care for half the population  the national INSSJP  popularly known as PAMI  covers nearly all of the five million senior citizens  189  Health care costs amount to almost 10  of GDP and have been growing in pace with the proportion of Argentines over 65  7  in 1970

private funds are spent evenly between private insurers  coverage and out of pocket expenses  190  191  There are more than 153 000 hospital beds  121 000 physicians and 37 000 dentists  ratios comparable to developed nations   192  193  The relatively high access to medical care has historically resulted in mortality patterns and trends similar to developed nations   from 1953 to 2005  deaths from cardiovascular disease increased from 20  to 23  of the total  those from tumors from 14  to 20   respiratory problems from 7  to 14   digestive maladies  non infectious  from 7  to 11   strokes a steady 7   injuries  6   and infectious diseases  4   Causes related to senility led to many of the rest  Infant deaths have fallen from 19  of all deaths in 1953 to 3  in 2005  192  194  The availability of health care has also reduced infant mortality from 70 per 1000 live births in 1948 195  to 12 1 in 2009 192  and raised life expectancy at birth from 60 years to 76  195  Though these figures compare favorably with global averages  they fall short of levels in developed nations and in 2006  Argentina ranked fourth in Latin America  193  See also Argentina portal Book
