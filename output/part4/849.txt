IndiaRandian heroPhilosophical movement   Philosophy portal v t e Objectivism is a philosophy created by Russian American philosopher and novelist Ayn Rand  1905 1982   Objectivism s central tenets are that reality exists independent of consciousness  that human beings have direct contact with reality through sense perception  that one can attain objective knowledge from perception through the process of concept formation and inductive logic  that the proper moral purpose of one s life is the pursuit of one s own happiness  or rational self interest   that the only social system consistent with this morality is full respect for individual rights embodied in laissez faire capitalism  and that the role of art in human life is to transform humans  metaphysical ideas by selective reproduction of reality into a physical form a work of art that one can comprehend and to which one can respond emotionally  Rand characterized Objectivism as  a philosophy for living on earth   grounded in reality  and aimed at defining human nature and the nature of the world in which we live  1  My philosophy  in essence  is the concept of man as a heroic being  with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life  with productive achievement as his noblest activity  and reason as his only absolute   Ayn Rand  Atlas Shrugged 2  The name  Objectivism  derives from the idea that human knowledge and values are objective  they exist and are determined by the nature of reality  to be discovered by one s mind  and are not created by the thoughts one has  3  Rand stated that she chose the name because her preferred term for a philosophy based on the primacy of existence  existentialism  had already been taken  4  Rand originally expressed her philosophical ideas in her novels The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged  and other works  She further elaborated on them in her periodicals The Objectivist Newsletter  The Objectivist  and The Ayn Rand Letter  and in non fiction books such as Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology and The Virtue of Selfishness  1  Contents 1 Philosophy 1 1 Metaphysics  objective reality 1 2 Epistemology  reason 1 3 Ethics  self interest 1 4

Philosophy  edit  Metaphysics  objective reality Rand s philosophy begins with three axioms  existence  identity  and consciousness  5  Rand defined an axiom as  a statement that identifies the base of knowledge and of any further statement pertaining to that knowledge  a statement necessarily contained in all others whether any particular speaker chooses to identify it or not  An axiom is a proposition that defeats its opponents by the fact that they have to accept it and use it in the process of any attempt to deny it   6  As Objectivist philosopher Leonard Peikoff noted  Rand s argument for axioms  is not a proof that the axioms of existence  consciousness  and identity are true  It is proof that they are axioms  that they are at the base of knowledge and thus inescapable   7  Rand held that existence is the perceptually self evident fact at the base of all other knowledge  i e   that  existence exists   She further held that to be is to be something  that  existence is identity   That is  to be is to be  an entity of a specific nature made of specific attributes   That which has no nature or attributes does not and cannot exist  The axiom of existence is grasped in differentiating something from nothing  while the law of identity is grasped in differentiating one thing from another  i e   one s first awareness of the law of non contradiction  another crucial base for the rest of knowledge  As Rand wrote   A leaf     cannot be all red and green at the same time  it cannot freeze and burn at the same time    A is A   8  Objectivism rejects belief in any thing alleged to transcend existence  9  Rand argues that consciousness   the faculty of perceiving that which exists   is an inherently relational phenomenon  As she puts it   to be conscious is to be conscious of something   that is consciousness itself cannot be distinguished or grasped except in relation to an independent reality  10   It cannot be aware only of itself there is no  itself  until it is aware of something   11  Thus  Objectivism holds that the mind does not create reality  but rather  it is a means of discovering reality  12  Expressed differently  existence has  primacy  over consciousness which must conform to it  Any other approach Rand termed  the primacy of consciousness   including any variant of metaphysical subjectivism or theism  13  Objectivist philosophy derives its explanations of action and causation from the axiom of identity  calling causation  the law of identity applied to action   14  According to Rand  it is entities that act  and every action is the action of an entity  The way entities act is caused by the specific nature  or  identity   of those entities  if they were different they would act differently  As with the other axioms  an implicit understanding of causation is derived from one s primary observations of causal connections among entities even before it is verbally identified  and serves as the basis of further knowledge  15   edit  Epistemology  reason Objectivist epistemology begins with the principle that  Consciousness is Identification   This is understood to be a direct consequence of the metaphysical principle that  Existence is Identity   16  Rand defined  reason  as  the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man s senses   17  Objectivist epistemology maintains that all knowledge is ultimately based on perception   Percepts  not sensations  are the given  the self evident   18  Rand considered the validity of the senses to be axiomatic  and claimed that purported arguments to the contrary all commit the fallacy of the  stolen concept  19  by presupposing the validity of concepts that  in turn  presuppose the validity of the senses  20  She held that perception  being physiologically determined  is incapable of error  So optical illusions  for example  are errors in the conceptual identification of what is seen  not errors in sight itself  21  Rand consequently rejected epistemological skepticism  as she holds that the skeptics  claim to knowledge  undistorted  by the form or the means of perception is impossible  21  The Objectivist theory of perception distinguishes between the form and object  The form in which an organism perceives is determined by the physiology of its sensory systems  Whatever form the organism perceives it in  what it perceives the object of perception is reality  22  Rand consequently rejected the Kantian dichotomy between  things as we perceive them  and  things as they are in themselves   Says Rand   The attack on man s consciousness and particularly on his conceptual faculty has rested on the unchallenged premise that any knowledge acquired by a process of consciousness is necessarily subjective and cannot correspond to the facts of reality  since it is  processed knowledge    but  all knowledge is processed knowledge whether on the sensory  perceptual or conceptual level  An  unprocessed  knowledge would be a knowledge acquired without means of cognition  23  Says Rand   The fundamental concept of method  the one on which all the others depend  is logic  The distinguishing characteristic of logic  the art of non contradictory identification  indicates the nature of the actions  actions of consciousness required to achieve a correct identification  and their goal  knowledge  while omitting the length  complexity or specific steps of the process of logical inference  as well as the nature of the particular cognitive problem involved in any given instance of using logic   24  According to Rand  attaining knowledge beyond what is given in perception requires both volition  or the exercise of free will  and adherence to a specific method of validation through observation  concept formation  and the application of inductive and deductive logic  A belief in  say  dragons  however sincere  does not oblige reality to contain any dragons  For anything that cannot be directly observed  a process of  proof  identifying the basis in reality of the claimed item of knowledge is necessary to establish its truth  25  According to Rand  consciousness possesses a specific  finite identity  just like everything else that exists  therefore  it must operate by a specific method of validation  An item of knowledge cannot be  disqualified  by being arrived at by a specific process in a particular form  Thus  for Rand  the fact that consciousness must itself possess identity implies the rejection of both universal skepticism based on the  limits  of consciousness and any claim to revelation  emotion or faith based belief  Rand rejected  feeling  as sources of knowledge  Rand acknowledged the importance of emotion for human beings  but she maintained that emotions are a consequence of the conscious or subconscious ideas that a person already accepts  not a means of achieving awareness of reality   Emotions are not tools of cognition   26  Rand also rejected all forms of faith or mysticism  terms that she used synonymously  She defined faith as  the acceptance of allegations without evidence or proof  either apart from or against the evidence of one s senses and reason    Mysticism is the claim to some non sensory  non rational  non definable  non identifiable means of knowledge  such as  instinct    intuition    revelation   or any form of  just knowing    27  Reliance on revelation is like reliance on a Ouija board  it bypasses the need to show how it connects its results to reality  Faith  for Rand  is not a  short cut  to knowledge  but a  short circuit  destroying it  28  The aspect of epistemology given the most elaboration by Rand is the theory of concept formation  which she presented in Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology  She argued that concepts are formed by a process of measurement omission  Peikoff described her view as follows  To form a concept  one mentally isolates a group of concretes  of distinct perceptual units   on the basis of observed similarities which distinguish them from all other known concretes  similarity is  the relationship between two or more existents which possess the same characteristic s   but in different measure or degree    then  by a process of omitting the particular measurements of these concretes  one integrates them into a single new mental unit  the concept  which subsumes all concretes of this kind  a potentially unlimited number   The integration is completed and retained by the selection of a perceptual symbol  a word  to designate it   A concept is a mental integration of two or more units possessing the same distinguishing characteristic s   with their particular measurements omitted    29  According to Rand    T he term  measurements omitted  does not mean  in this context  that measurements are regarded as non existent  it means that measurements exist  but are not specified  That measurements must exist is an essential part of the process  The principle is  the relevant measurements must exist in some quantity  but may exist in any quantity   30  Rand argued that concepts are hierarchically organized  Concepts such as  dog   which bring together  concretes  available in perception  can be differentiated  into the concepts of  dachshund    poodle   etc   or integrated  along with  cat   etc   into the concept of  animal    Abstract concepts such as  animal  can be further integrated  via  abstraction from abstractions   into such concepts as  living thing   Concepts are formed in the context of knowledge available  A young child differentiates dogs from cats and chickens  but need not explicitly differentiate them from deep sea tube worms  or from other types of animals not yet known to him  to form a concept  dog   31  Because of its view of concepts as  open ended  classifications that go well beyond the characteristics included in their past or current definitions  Objectivist epistemology rejects the analytic synthetic distinction as a false dichotomy 32  and denies the possibility of a priori knowledge  33  Objectivist epistemology acknowledges the facts that human beings have limited knowledge  are vulnerable to error  and do not instantly understand all of the implications of their knowledge  34  According to Peikoff  one can be certain of a proposition if all of the available evidence supports it  i e   it can be logically integrated with the rest of one s knowledge  one is then certain within the context of the evidence  35  Some commentators have argued that the Objectivist epistemology is incomplete  36  Psychology professor Robert L  Campbell says the relationship between Objectivist epistemology and cognitive science remains unclear because Rand  Peikoff  and Kelley have all made extensive claims about human cognition and its development which appear to belong to psychology  yet Rand argued that philosophy is logically prior to psychology and in no way dependent on it  37  38   edit  Ethics  self interest Objectivism includes an extensive treatment of ethical concerns  Ayn Rand wrote on morality in her works The Virtue of Selfishness and Atlas Shrugged  Rand defines morality as  a code of values to guide man s choices and actions the choices and actions that determine the purpose and the course of his life   39  Rand maintained that the first question isn t what should the code of values be  the first question is  Does man need values at all and why   According to Rand   it is only the concept of  Life  that makes the concept of  Value  possible   and   the fact that a living entity is  determines what it ought to do    40  Rand writes   there is only one fundamental alternative in the universe  existence or non existence and it pertains to a single class of entities  to living organisms  The existence of inanimate matter is unconditional  the existence of life is not  it depends on a specific course of action    It is only a living organism that faces a constant alternative  the issue of life or death     The survival of the organism is the ultimate value to which all of the organism s activities are aimed  the end served by all of its lesser values  Rand argued that the primary focus of man s free will is in the choice   to think or not to think    Thinking is not an automatic function  In any hour and issue of his life  man is free to think or to evade that effort  Thinking requires a state of full  focused awareness  The act of focusing one s consciousness is volitional  Man can focus his mind to a full  active  purposefully directed awareness of reality or he can unfocus it and let himself drift in a semiconscious daze  merely reacting to any chance stimulus of the immediate moment  at the mercy of his undirected sensory perceptual mechanism and of any random  associational connections it might happen to make   41  According to Rand  therefore  possessing free will  human beings must choose their values  one does not automatically hold one s own life as his ultimate value  Whether in fact a person s actions promote and fulfill his own life or not is a question of fact  as it is with all other organisms  but whether a person will act to promote his well being is up to him  not hard wired into his physiology   Man has the power to act as his own destroyer and that is the way he has acted through most of his history   42  Says Rand   Man s mind is his basic tool of survival  Life is given to him  survival is not  His body is given to him  its sustenance is not  His mind is given to him  its content is not  To remain alive he must act and before he can act he must know the nature and purpose of his action  He cannot obtain his food without knowledge of food and of the way to obtain it  He cannot dig a ditch  or build a cyclotron  without a knowledge of his aim and the means to achieve it  To remain alive  he must think   43  In her novels  The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged  she also emphasizes the central importance of productive work  romantic love and art to human happiness  and dramatizes the ethical character of their pursuit  The primary virtue in Objectivist ethics is rationality  as Rand meant it  the recognition and acceptance of reason as one s only source of knowledge  one s only judge of values and one s only guide to action   44  The purpose of a moral code  Rand held  is to provide the principles by reference to which man can achieve the values his survival requires  45  Rand summarizes  If  man  chooses to live  a rational ethics will tell him what principles of action are required to implement his choice  If he does not choose to live  nature will take its course  Reality confronts a man with a great many  must s   but all of them are conditional  the formula of realistic necessity is   you must  if    and the if stands for man s choice   if you want to achieve a certain goal   46  Rand s explanation of values presents the view that an individual s primary moral obligation is to achieve his own well being it is for his life and his self interest that an individual ought to adhere to a moral code  47 Egoism is a corollary of setting man s life as the moral standard  48  Rand believed that egoism was the logical consequence of humans following evidence wherever it leads them  The only alternative would be that they live without orientation to reality  A corollary to Rand s endorsement of self interest is her rejection of the ethical doctrine of altruism which she defined in the sense of Auguste Comte s altruism  he coined the term   as a moral obligation to live for the sake of others  Rand also rejected subjectivism  A  whim worshiper  or  hedonist   according to Rand  is not motivated by a desire to live his own human life  but by a wish to live on a sub human level  Instead of using  that which promotes my  human  life  as his standard of value  he mistakes  that which I  mindlessly happen to  value  for a standard of value  in contradiction of the fact that  existentially  he is a human and therefore rational organism  The  I value  in whim worship or hedonism can be replaced with  we value    he values    they value   or  God values   and still it would remain dissociated from reality  Rand repudiated the equation of rational selfishness with hedonistic or whim worshiping  selfishness without a self   She held that the former is good  and the latter evil  and that there is a fundamental difference between them  49  For Rand  all of the principal virtues are applications of the role of reason as man s basic tool of survival  rationality  honesty  justice  independence  integrity  productiveness  and pride each of which she explains in some detail in  The Objectivist Ethics   50  The essence of Objectivist ethics is summarized by the oath her Atlas Shrugged character John Galt adhered to  I swear by my life and my love of it that I will never live for the sake of another man  nor ask another man to live for mine  Many commentators have criticized Objectivist ethics  In the essay  On the Randian Argument   Robert Nozick  while sympathetic to Rand s political conclusions  is particularly critical of Rand s foundational argument in ethics  which states that one s own life is  for each individual  the ultimate value because it makes all other values possible  He argues that to make her argument sound  one needs to explain why someone could not rationally prefer dying and having no values  Thus  her attempt to defend the morality of selfishness is  in his view  essentially an instance of begging the question  Nozick also argues that Rand s solution to David Hume s famous is ought problem is unsatisfactory  In response  philosophers Douglas Rasmussen and Douglas Den Uyl have argued that Nozick misstated Rand s case  51  52  Robert Hollinger Charles King criticized the Objectivist ethics in his essay  Life and the Theory of Value  The Randian Argument Reconsidered   53  King criticized Rand s example of an indestructible robot to demonstrate the value of life as incorrect and confusing  In response  Paul St  F  Blair defended Rand s ethical conclusions  while maintaining that his arguments might not have been approved by Rand  54   edit  Politics  individual rights and capitalism Rand s defense of individual liberty integrates elements from her entire philosophy  55  Since reason is the means of human knowledge  it is therefore each person s most fundamental means of survival and is necessary to the achievement of values  56  The use or threat of force neutralizes the practical effect of an individual s reason  whether the force originates from the state or from a criminal  According to Rand   man s mind will not function at the point of a gun   57  Therefore  the only type of organized human behavior consistent with the operation of reason is that of voluntary cooperation  Persuasion is the method of reason  By its nature  the overtly irrational cannot rely on the use of persuasion and must ultimately resort to force to prevail  58  Thus  Rand saw reason and freedom as correlates  just as she saw mysticism and force as corollaries  59  Based on this understanding of the role of reason  Objectivists hold that the initiation of physical force against the will of another is immoral  60  as are indirect initiations of force through threats  61  fraud  62  or breach of contract  63  The use of defensive or retaliatory force  on the other hand  is appropriate  64  Objectivism holds that because the opportunity to use reason without the initiation of force is necessary to achieve moral values  each individual has an inalienable moral right to act as his own judgment directs and to keep the product of his effort  Peikoff  explaining the basis of rights  stated   In content  as the founding fathers recognized  there is one fundamental right  which has several major derivatives  The fundamental right is the right to life  Its major derivatives are the right to liberty  property  and the pursuit of happiness   65   A  right  is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man s freedom of action in a social context   66  These rights are specifically understood to be rights to action  not to specific results or objects  and the obligations created by rights are negative in nature  each individual must refrain from violating the rights of others  67  Objectivists reject alternative notions of rights  such as positive rights  68 collective rights  or animal rights  69  Objectivism holds that the only social system which fully recognizes individual rights is capitalism  70  specifically what Rand described as  full  pure  uncontrolled  unregulated laissez faire capitalism   71  Objectivism regards capitalism as the social system which is most beneficial to the poor  but that this isn t its primary justification  72  Rather  it is the only moral social system  Objectivism maintains that only societies seeking to establish freedom  or free nations  have a right to self determination  73  Objectivism views government as  the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control i e   under objectively defined laws   thus  government is both legitimate and critically important 74  in order to protect individual rights  75  Rand opposed so called  rational anarchism   because she saw putting police and courts on the market as an inherent miscarriage of justice  Objectivism holds that the proper functions of a government are  the police  to protect men from criminals the armed services  to protect men from foreign invaders the law courts  to settle disputes among men according to objectively defined laws   the executive  and legislatures  76  Furthermore  in protecting individual rights  the government is acting as an agent of its citizens and  has no rights except the rights delegated to it by the citizens  77  and it must act in an impartial manner according to specific  objectively defined laws  78  Objectivists Leonard Peikoff and Yaron Brook have since expressed support for other government functions  79  80  Rand argued that limited intellectual property monopolies being granted to certain inventors and artists on a first to file basis as moral because she viewed all property as fundamentally intellectual  Furthermore  the value of a commercial product comes in part from the necessary work of its inventors  However  Rand viewed limits on patents and copyrights as important and held that if they were granted in perpetuity  it would necessarily lead to de facto collectivism  Rand opposed racism and any legal application of racism  She considered affirmative action to be an example of legal racism  81  Rand advocated the right to legal abortion  82  She opposed involuntary military conscription  but also thought those who avoided being drafted should be held criminally liable  83  She opposed any form of censorship  including legal restrictions on pornography  84  Objectivists have also opposed a number of government activities commonly supported by both liberals and conservatives  including antitrust laws  85  the minimum wage  public education  86  and existing child labor laws  87  Objectivists have argued against faith based initiatives  88  displaying religious symbols in government facilities  89  and the teaching of  intelligent design  in public schools  90  Maintaining that it should be phased out gradually  Rand opposed taxation as she considered it theft and an endorsement of force over reason  91  92  Some critics  such as Norman P  Barry and Chandran Kukathas  have argued that her ethics are consistent with anarcho capitalism  93  94  95   edit  Aesthetics  metaphysical value judgments See also  Romantic realism The Objectivist theory of art flows from its epistemology  by way of  psycho epistemology   Rand s term for an individual s characteristic mode of functioning in acquiring knowledge   Art  according to Objectivism  serves a human cognitive need  it allows human beings to grasp concepts as though they were percepts  Objectivism defines  art  as a  selective re creation of reality according to an artist s metaphysical value judgments  that is  according to what the artist believes to be ultimately true and important about the nature of reality and humanity  In this respect Objectivism regards art as a way of presenting abstractions concretely  in perceptual form  96  The human need for art  on this view  stems from the need for cognitive economy  A concept is already a sort of mental shorthand standing for a large number of concretes  allowing a human being to think indirectly or implicitly of many more such concretes than can be held explicitly in mind  But a human being cannot hold indefinitely many concepts explicitly in mind either and yet  on the Objectivist view  needs a comprehensive conceptual framework to provide guidance in life  Art offers a way out of this dilemma by providing a perceptual  easily grasped means of communicating and thinking about a wide range of abstractions  including one s metaphysical value judgments  Objectivism regards art as an effective way to communicate a moral or ethical ideal  97  Objectivism does not  however  regard art as propagandistic  even though art involves moral values and ideals  its purpose is not to educate  only to show or project  Moreover  art need not be  and usually is not  the outcome of a full blown  explicit philosophy  Usually it stems from an artist s sense of life  which is preconceptual and largely emotional   98  Rand held that Romanticism was the highest school of literary art  noting that Romanticism was  based on the recognition of the principle that man possesses the faculty of volition   absent which  Rand believed  literature is robbed of dramatic power  adding  What the Romanticists brought to art was the primacy of values  Values are the source of emotions  a great deal of emotional intensity was projected in the work of the Romanticists and in the reactions of their audiences  as well as a great deal of color  imagination  originality  excitement  and all the other consequences of a value oriented view of life  99  The term  romanticism   however  is often affiliated with emotionalism  to which Objectivism is completely opposed  Historically  many romantic artists were philosophically subjectivist  Most Objectivists who are also artists subscribe to what they call romantic realism  which is how Rand labeled her own work  100   edit  Post Rand

the insights of J  L  Austin and Gilbert Harman  in works such as Objectivity  2004   and David Kelley has explicated Rand s epistemological ideas in works such as The Evidence of the Senses  1986  and A Theory of Abstraction  2001   In the field of ethics  Kelley has argued in works such as Unrugged Individualism  1996  and The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand  2000  that Objectivists should pay more attention to the virtue of benevolence and place less emphasis on issues of moral sanction  Kelley s views have been controversial  with critics arguing that he contradicts important principles of Objectivism  101  An author who focuses on Rand s ethics  Tara Smith  stays closer to Rand s original ideas in such works as Moral Rights and Political Freedom  1995   Viable Values  2000   and Ayn

2000   to teleology  as in The Biological Basis of Teleological Concepts by Harry Binswanger  1990    edit  Intellectual Impact Main article  Objectivist movement Quote from Ayn Rand at the Epcot Center  Walt Disney World Academic philosophers have generally dismissed Objectivism since Rand first presented it  105  106  107  108  109  Objectivism has been called  fiercely anti academic  because of Rand s criticism of contemporary intellectuals  110  111  David Sidorsky  a professor of moral and political philosophy at Columbia University  says Rand s work is  outside the mainstream  and is more of an ideological movement than a well grounded philosophy  112  Rand is not found in the comprehensive academic reference texts The Oxford Companion to Philosophy or The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy  but is the subject of entries in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  113 The Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers  114  the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy  115  and The Routledge Dictionary of Twentieth Century Political Thinkers  116  A listing of Rand also appears in the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy  featuring the assessment  The influence of Rand s ideas was strongest among college students in the USA but attracted little attention from academic philosophers  Her outspoken defense of capitalism in works like Capitalism  The Unknown Ideal  1967   and her characterization of her position as a defence of the  virtue of selfishness  in her essay collection of the same title published in 1964  also brought notoriety  but kept her out of the intellectual mainstream   94  In recent years Rand s works are more likely to be encountered in the classroom  110  The Ayn Rand Society  dedicated to fostering the scholarly study of Objectivism  is affiliated with the American Philosophical Association s Eastern Division  117 Aristotle scholar and Objectivist Allan Gotthelf  chairman of the Society  and his colleagues have argued for more academic study of Objectivism  viewing the philosophy as a unique and intellectually interesting defense of classical liberalism that is worth debating  118  Since 1999 a refereed Journal of Ayn Rand Studies began  119  In 2006 the University of Pittsburgh held a conference focusing on Objectivism  120  In addition  there is a growing list of Objectivist philosophers  including Tara Smith and James G  Lennox  who hold tenured positions at leading American philosophy departments  121  Programs and fellowships for the study of Objectivism have been supported at the University of Pittsburgh  University of Texas at Austin and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  122  According to one Rand biographer  most people first read Rand s works in their  formative years   123  Rand s former prot g  Nathaniel Branden referred to Rand s  especially powerful appeal to the young   124  while Onkar Ghate of the Ayn Rand Institute said Rand  appeals to the idealism of youth   125  This appeal has alarmed a number of critics of the philosophy  126  Many of these young people later abandon their positive view of Rand and are often said to have  outgrown  her ideas  127  Supporters of Rand s work recognize the phenomenon  but attribute it to the loss of youthful idealism and inability to resist social pressures for intellectual conformity  125  127  In contrast  Jennifer Burns says some critics  dismiss Rand as a shallow thinker appealing only to adolescents   although Burns thinks the critics  miss her significance  as a  gateway drug  to right wing politics  128   edit  See also
