the northeastern corner of the United States consisting of the six states of Maine  New Hampshire  Vermont  Massachusetts  Rhode Island  and Connecticut  New England is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean  Canada  the Canadian Maritimes and Quebec  and the state of New York  In one of the earliest English settlements in North America  Pilgrims from England first settled in New England in 1620  to form Plymouth Colony  Ten years later  the Puritans settled north of Plymouth Colony in Boston  thus forming Massachusetts Bay Colony  Over the next 130 years  New England fought in four French and Indian Wars  until the British defeated the French and their native allies in North America  In the late 18th century  the New England Colonies initiated the resistance to the British Parliament s efforts to impose new taxes without the consent of the colonists  The Boston Tea Party was a protest that angered Great Britain  which responded with the  Intolerable Acts   stripping the colonies of self government  The confrontation led to open warfare in 1775  the expulsion of the British from New England in spring 1776  and the Declaration of Independence in July 1776  The first movements of American literature  philosophy  and education originated in New England  The region played a prominent role in the movement to abolish slavery and was the first region of the United States to be transformed by the Industrial Revolution  Today  New England is a major world center of education  high technology  insurance  and medicine  Boston is its cultural  financial  educational  medical and transportation center  Each state is principally subdivided into small incorporated municipalities known as New England towns  which are often governed by town meeting  The only unincorporated territory in New England exists in the sparse  northern regions of Vermont  New Hampshire  and Maine  Since 1970  voters have more often supported liberal candidates at the state and federal level than those of any other region in the United States  New England has the only non geographic regional name recognized by the federal government  It maintains a strong sense of cultural identity set apart from the rest of the country  although the terms of this identity are often contested  combining Puritanism with liberalism  agrarian life with industry  and isolation with immigration  Autumn

The earliest known inhabitants of New England were American Indians who spoke a variety of the Eastern Algonquian languages  4  Prominent tribes included the Abenaki  Penobscot  Pequot  Mohegans  Pocumtuck  and Wampanoag  4  Prior to the arrival of Europeans  the Western Abenakis inhabited New Hampshire and Vermont  as well as parts of Quebec and western Maine  5  Their principal town was Norridgewock  in present day Maine  6  The Penobscot lived along the Penobscot River in Maine  The Wampanoag occupied southeastern Massachusetts  Rhode Island  and the islands of Martha s Vineyard and Nantucket  The Pocumtucks lived in Western Massachusetts  and the Mohegan and Pequot tribes in the Connecticut region  The Connecticut River Valley  which includes parts of Vermont  New Hampshire  Massachusetts and Connecticut  linked different indigenous communities culturally  linguistically  and politically  4  As early as 1600  French  Dutch  and English traders  exploring the New World  began to trade metal  glass  and cloth for local beaver pelts  4  7   edit  The Virginia Companies Main article  New England Colonies On April 10  1606  King James I of England issued a charter for each of the Virginia Companies  London and Plymouth  8  9  10  These were privately funded ventures  intended to claim land for England  trade  and return a profit  11  The Virginia Company of Plymouth s charter included land extending as far as present day northern Maine  12  It established the Popham Colony at the mouth of the Kennebec River in Maine in the fall of 1607  Unlike the Jamestown Settlement  it was not successful  and was abandoned the following spring  13 Captain John Smith  exploring the shores of the region in 1614  named it  New England  14  in his account of two voyages there  published as A Description of New England  The next notable arrival in New England took place in the winter of 1616 1617 at Winter Harbor  afterwards called Biddeford Pool  by Captain Richard Vines  15  This location is in current day Biddeford  Maine  Four years later  Plymouth in Massachusetts was settled by Pilgrims from the Mayflower  beginning the history of permanent European settlement in New England  16   edit  Plymouth Council for New England Main articles  Plymouth Council for New England  Connecticut Colony  and Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations An early English map of New England  c  1670  depicts the area around modern Portsmouth  New Hampshire  The name  New England  was officially sanctioned on November 3  1620  17  when the charter of the Virginia Company of Plymouth was replaced by a royal charter for the Plymouth Council for New England  a joint stock company established to colonize and govern the region  18  As the first colonists arrived in Plymouth  they wrote and signed the Mayflower Compact  19  their first governing document  20  The Massachusetts Bay Colony  which would come to dominate the area  was established by royal charter in 1629 21  22  with its major town and port of Boston established in 1630  23  Massachusetts Puritans began to settle in Connecticut in as early as 1633  24 Roger Williams  banished from Massachusetts for heresy  led a group south  and founded Providence  in the area that later became the state of Rhode Island  in 1636  25  26  At this time  Vermont was yet unsettled  and the territories of New Hampshire and Maine were claimed and governed by Massachusetts  27   edit  Colonial Wars New England s Siege of Louisbourg  1745  by Peter Monamy Relationships between colonists and Native Americans alternated between peace and armed skirmishes  the bloodiest of which was the Pequot War in 1643  which resulted in the Mystic massacre  Six years later  the colonies of Massachusetts Bay  Plymouth  New Haven  and Connecticut joined together in a loose compact called the New England Confederation  officially  The United Colonies of New England    The confederation was designed largely to coordinate mutual defense  but was never effective and soon collapsed  In 1675  King Philip s War pitted the colonists and their native American allies against a widespread native American uprising  resulting in massacres and killings on both sides  The colonists won in the south decisively  however  they were forced to sign peace treaties in the North in present day New Hampshire and Maine  During the next seventy four years  there were six colonial wars that took place primarily between New England and New France  see the French and Indian Wars as well as Father Rale s War and Father Le Loutre s War   Throughout these wars  New England was allied with the Iroquois Confederacy and New France was allied with the Wabanaki Confederacy  After the New England Conquest of Acadia in 1710  mainland Nova Scotia was under the control of New England  but both present day New Brunswick and virtually all of present day Maine remained contested territory between New England and New France  After the British won the sixth and final war   the French and Indian War   in 1763  the Connecticut River Valley was opened up for settlement into western New Hampshire and what is today Vermont  The New England colonies were settled largely by farmers  who became relatively self sufficient  Later  aided by the Puritan work ethic  New England s economy began to focus on crafts and trade  in contrast to the Southern colonies  which had to import many goods from England  28   edit  Dominion of New England Main articles  Dominion of New England  American War of Independence  American Revolution  and Boston campaign The First Flag  and Ensign  of New England  used by colonial merchant ships sailing out of New England ports  1686 c 1737 29  30  By 1686  King James II had become concerned about the increasingly independent ways of the colonies  including their self governing charters  their open flouting of the Navigation Acts  and their growing military power  He therefore established the Dominion of New England  an administrative union comprising all of the New England colonies  31  In 1688  the former Dutch colonies of New York and New Jersey were added to the Dominion  The union  imposed from the outside and contrary to the rooted democratic tradition of the region  was highly unpopular among the colonists  32  The Dominion significantly modified the charters of the colonies  including the appointment of Royal Governors to nearly all of them  There was an uneasy tension between the Royal Governors  their officers  and the elected governing bodies of the colonies  The governors wanted unlimited authority  and the different layers of locally elected officials would often resist them  In most cases  the local town governments continued operating as self governing bodies  just as they had before the appointment of the governors  33  After the Glorious Revolution in 1689  Bostonians overthrew the royal governor  Sir Edmund Andros  They seized dominion officials and adherents to the Church of England during a popular and bloodless uprising  34  These tensions eventually culminated in the American Revolution  boiling over with the outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1775  The first battles of the war were fought in Lexington and Concord  Massachusetts  later leading to the Siege of Boston by continental troops  In March of 1776  British forces were compelled to retreat from Boston   edit  New England and the early United States Boston College  The architecture style is Collegiate Gothic  a subgenre of Gothic Revival architecture  a 19th century movement   edit  Postrevolutionary New England After the War of Independence  New England ceased to be a meaningful political unit  but remained a defined cultural region consisting of its now sovereign constituent states  By 1784  all of the states in the region had taken steps towards the abolition of slavery  with Vermont and Massachusetts introducing total abolition in 1777 and 1783  respectively  35  During the War of 1812  there was a movement within New England for secession from the United States  as New England merchants  only beginning to recover  opposed war with their greatest trading partner Great Britain  36  Delegates met in the Hartford Convention in the winter of 1814 15  The twenty seven delegates met to discuss changes to the U S  Constitution to protect the region s interests and maintain its political power  feeling used as pawns in the focus on trade restrictions  37  After settling a dispute with New York  Vermont was admitted to statehood in 1791  formally completing the defined area of New England  On March 15  1820  as part of the Missouri Compromise  the territory of Maine  formerly a part of Massachusetts  was admitted to the Union as a free state  38  Today  New England is defined as made up of the six states of Connecticut  Maine  Massachusetts  New Hampshire  Rhode Island  and Vermont  39  For the rest of the period before the American Civil War  New England remained distinct from the rest of the U S  Politically  it often disagreed with the rest of the country  40  Massachusetts and Connecticut were among the last refuges of the Federalist Party  and  when the Second Party System began in the 1830s  New England became the strongest bastion of the new Whig Party  The Whigs were usually dominant throughout New England  except in the more Democratic Maine and New Hampshire  Leading statesmen including Daniel Webster hailed from the region  New England was distinct in other ways  Many notable literary and intellectual figures produced by the United States before the American Civil War were New Englanders  including Ralph Waldo Emerson  Henry David Thoreau  Nathaniel Hawthorne  Henry Wadsworth Longfellow  John Greenleaf Whittier  George Bancroft  and William H  Prescott  41   edit  Industrial Revolution and abolitionist movement The Slater Mill Historic Site in Pawtucket  Rhode Island New England was key to the industrial revolution in the U S  42  In 1787  the first cotton mill in America  the Beverly Cotton Manufactory  was founded in the North Shore seaport of Beverly  Massachusetts  43  The Manufactory was also considered the largest cotton mill of its time  Technological developments and achievements from the Manufactory led to the development of more advanced cotton mills  including Slater Mill in Pawtucket  Rhode Island  The Blackstone Valley  running through Massachusetts and Rhode Island  has been called the birthplace of America s industrial revolution  44  Towns such as Lawrence and Lowell in Massachusetts  Woonsocket in Rhode Island  and Lewiston in Maine became centers of the textile industry following the innovations at Slater Mill and the Beverly Cotton Manufactory  The rapid growth of textile manufacturing in New England caused a shortage of workers  Recruiters were hired by mill agents to bring young women and children from the countryside to work in the factories  Between 1830 and 1860  thousands of farm girls moved from rural areas to work in the mills  Farmers  daughters left their homes to aid their families financially  save for marriage  and widen their horizons  Stagecoach and railroad services made it easier for large numbers of workers to travel from the country to the city  The majority of female workers came from farming towns in northern New England  As the textile industry grew  immigration also grew  As the number of Irish workers in the mills increased  the number of young women working in the mills decreased  Mill employment of women caused a population boom in urban centers  45  New England was  as a whole  the most industrialized part of the U S   by 1850  it accounted for well over a quarter of all manufacturing value in the country  and over a third of its industrial workforce  46  It was also the most literate and most educated region in the country  46  New England and areas settled from New England  like Upstate New York  Ohio s Western Reserve and the upper midwestern states of Michigan and Wisconsin  proved to be the center of the strongest abolitionist sentiment in the country  Abolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips were New Englanders  and the region was home to anti slavery politicians like John Quincy Adams  Charles Sumner  and John P  Hale  When the anti slavery Republican Party was formed in the 1850s  all of New England  including areas that had previously been strongholds for both the Whig and the Democratic Parties  became strongly Republican  as it would remain until the early 20th century  when immigration would begin to turn the formerly solidly Republican states of Lower New England towards the Democrats  The region had problems transitioning from manufacturing to other industries  In 2000  New England had two of the ten poorest cities  by percentage living below the poverty line  in the U S   the state capital cities of Providence  Rhode Island and Hartford  Connecticut  47  They were no longer in the bottom ten by 2010   edit  Geography Main articles  Geography of Connecticut  Geography of Maine  Geography of Massachusetts  Geography of New Hampshire  Geography of Rhode Island  and Geography of Vermont A political and geographical map of New England shows the coastal plains in the east and hills  mountains  and valleys in the west and the north  The states of New England have a combined area of 71 991 8 sq mi  186 458 km2   making the region slightly larger than the state of Washington and larger than England  48  49  Maine alone constitutes nearly one half of the total area of New England  yet is only the 39th largest state  slightly smaller than Indiana  The remaining states are among the smallest in the U S   including the smallest state  Rhode Island   edit  Topography New England s long rolling hills  mountains  and jagged coastline are glacial landforms resulting from the retreat of ice sheets approximately 18 000 years ago  during the last glacial period  50  51  New England is geologically a part of the New England province  an exotic terrane region consisting of the Appalachian Mountains  the New England highlands  and the seaboard lowlands  52  The Appalachian Mountains roughly follow the border between New England and New York  The Berkshires in Massachusetts and the Green Mountains in Vermont  as well as the Taconic Mountains  form a spine of Precambrian rock  53  The Appalachians extend northwards into New Hampshire as the White Mountains  and then into Maine and Canada  Mount Washington in New Hampshire is the highest peak in the Northeast and the second highest peak in the Appalachian Mountain system  at 6 288 ft  1 917 m   54  It is the site of the second highest recorded wind speed on Earth  55  56  and has the reputation of having the world s worst weather  54  57  The coast of the region  extending from southwestern Connecticut to northeastern Maine  is dotted with lakes  hills  swamps  and sandy beaches  51  Important valleys in the region include the Connecticut River Valley and the Merrimack Valley  51  The longest river is the Connecticut River  which flows from northeastern New Hampshire for 655 km  407 mi   emptying into Long Island Sound  roughly bisecting the region  Lake Champlain  wedged between Vermont and New York  is the largest lake in the region  followed by Moosehead Lake in Maine and Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire  51   edit  Climate The White Mountains of New Hampshire are part of the Appalachian Mountains  Weather patterns vary throughout the region  Most of Maine  New Hampshire  and Vermont have a humid continental short summer climate  58  with mild summers and cold winters  Connecticut  Massachusetts  Rhode Island  southern coastal Maine  and southern New Hampshire and Vermont have a humid continental long summer climate  58  with warm summers and cold winters  Owing to thick deciduous forests  fall in New England brings bright and colorful foliage  which comes earlier than in other nearby regions  attracting tourism by  leaf peepers   59  In general  springs are wet and cloudy  Average rainfall ranges from 40 to 60 inches  1 000 to 1 500 mm  a year  although the northern parts of Vermont and Maine experience slightly less  from 20 to 40 inches  510 to 1 000 mm   Snowfall often exceeds 98 in  2 500 mm  annually  As a result  the mountains and ski resorts of Maine  New Hampshire and Vermont are popular destinations in the winter  42  60  The lowest recorded temperature in New England was  50  F   46  C  at Bloomfield  Vermont  on December 30  1933  This was tied by Big Black River  Maine in 2009  61  Rhode Island is the warmest state in New England

largest minority  and they are the second largest group in the region behind non Hispanic European Americans  Hispanics and Latinos of any race made up 7 9  of New England s population  and there were over 1 1 million Hispanic and Latino individuals reported in the survey  Puerto Ricans were the most numerous of the Hispanic and Latino subgroups  Over half a million  507 000  Puerto Ricans live in New England  forming 3 6  of the population  There are also just over 100 000 Mexican Americans  The Dominican population is more than 70 000  66 Americans of Cuban descent are scant in number  there were roughly 20 000 Cuban Americans in the region  People of other Hispanic and Latino ancestries  for example Salvadoran  Colombian  and Bolivian  formed 3 5  of New England s population  and numbered over 492 000  67  New England s European American population is ethnically diverse  The majority of the Euro American population is of Irish  Italian  English  French  and German descent  Smaller but significant populations of Poles  French Canadians  and Portuguese exist as well  According to the 2006 2008 survey  the top ten largest European ancestries were the following  Irish  21 1

population density is much greater than that of the U S  as a whole  79 56 sq mi  or even just the contiguous 48 states  94 48 sq mi   Three quarters of the population of New England  and most of the major cities  are in the states of Connecticut  Massachusetts  and Rhode Island  Their combined population density is 786 83 sq mi  compared to northern New England s 63 56 sq mi  2000 census   The most populous state is Massachusetts  and the most populous city is Massachusetts  political and cultural capital  Boston  Providence claims the largest contiguous area of National Register of Historic Places listed buildings in the U S  The coastline is more urban than the western parts of the region  which are typically rural  even in urban states like Massachusetts  This is due mainly to historical factors  the original colonists settled mostly on the coastline of Massachusetts Bay  The only New England state without access to the Atlantic Ocean  Vermont  is also the least urbanized  72  After nearly 400 years  the region still maintains  for the most part  its historical population layout  New England s coast is dotted with urban centers  such as Portland  Portsmouth  Boston  New Bedford  Fall River  Providence  New Haven  Bridgeport  and Stamford  as well as smaller cities such as Newburyport  Gloucester  Biddeford  Bath  Rockland  Newport  Westerly  and the small twin cities of Groton and New London in Connecticut  Southern New England forms an integral part of the BosWash megalopolis  a conglomeration of urban centers that spans from Boston to Washington  D C   The region includes three of the four most densely populated states in the U S   only New Jersey has a higher population density than the states of Rhode Island  Massachusetts  and Connecticut  Greater Boston  which includes parts of southern New Hampshire  has a total population of approximately 4 4 million  73  while over half the population of New England falls inside Boston s Combined

thirteen  healthiest states  of the U S  in 2007  79  In 2008  they all placed within the top eleven states  New England also had the largest proportion of its population covered by health insurance  80  For 2006  four states in the region  Massachusetts  New Hampshire  Rhode Island  and Connecticut  joined 12 others nationwide  where the number of deaths caused by drugs had overtaken traffic fatalities  This was due in part to declining traffic fatalities  and in part to increased deaths caused by prescription drugs  81  In comparing national obesity rates by state  four of the six lowest obesity states were Connecticut  Massachusetts  Vermont and Rhode Island  New Hampshire and Maine had the 15th and 18th lowest obesity rates  making New England the least overweight part of the U S  82  In 2008  three of New England s states had the least number of uninsured motorists  out of the top five states   Massachusetts   1   Maine   4   and Vermont   6   83  In 2006  Massachusetts adopted health care reform that requires nearly all state residents obtain health insurance  84  which served as an important model for the federal 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  85  Nursing home care can be expensive in the region  A private room in Connecticut averaged  125 925 annually  A one bedroom in an assisted living facility averaged  55 137 in Massachusetts  Both are

extreme in the colonies they founded  and those who deviated from the established doctrine were persecuted greatly  The early history of much of New England is marked by religious intolerance and harsh laws  In the beginning  there was no separation of church and state  and the activities of the individual were severely restricted  111  This contrasts sharply with the strong principles of separation of church and state underlying the foundation of Rhode Island  Providence had no public burial ground and no Common until the year 1700  64 years after its founding  because religious and government institutions were so rigorously kept distinct  112   edit  Town meetings Main articles  Town meeting and New England town A New England town meeting in Huntington  Vermont A derivative of meetings held by church elders  town meetings were and are an integral part of governance of many New England towns  At such meetings  any citizen of the town may discuss issues with other members of the community and vote on them  This is the strongest example of direct democracy in the U S  today  and the form of dialogue has been adopted under certain circumstances elsewhere  most strongly in the states closest to the region  such as New York  New Jersey and Pennsylvania  citation needed  Such a strong democratic tradition was even apparent in the early 19th century  when Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in Democracy in America that in    New England  where education and liberty are the daughters of morality and religion  where society has acquired age and stability enough to enable it to form principles and hold fixed habits  the common people are accustomed to respect intellectual and moral superiority and to submit to it without complaint  although they set at naught all those privileges which wealth and birth have introduced among mankind  In New England  consequently  the democracy makes a more judicious choice than it does elsewhere  113    By contrast  James Madison wrote in Federalist No  55 that  regardless of the assembly   passion never fails to wrest the scepter from reason  Had every Athenian citizen been a Socrates  every Athenian assembly would still have been a mob   114  The use and effectiveness of town meetings  as well as the possible application of the format to other regions and countries  is still discussed by scholars  115   edit  Elections In the 2000 presidential election  Democratic candidate Al Gore carried all of the New England states except for New Hampshire  and in 2004  John Kerry  a New Englander himself  won all six New England

primary  Historically  the New Hampshire primary has been the first in a series of nationwide political party primary elections held in the United States every four years  Held in the state of New Hampshire  it usually marks the beginning of the U S  presidential election process  Even though few delegates are chosen from New Hampshire  the primary has always been pivotal to both New England and American politics  One college in particular  Saint Anselm College  has been home to numerous national presidential debates and visits by candidates to its campus  124  Local factories and diners are valuable photo opportunities for candidates  who hope to use this quintessential New England image to their advantage by portraying themselves as sympathetic to blue collar workers  Media coverage of the primary enables candidates low on funds to  rally back   an example of this was President Bill Clinton who referred to himself as  The Comeback Kid  following the 1992 primary  National media outlets have converged on small New Hampshire towns  such as during the 2007 and 2008 national presidential debates held at Saint Anselm College in the town of Goffstown  125  126  Goffstown and other

Scotland   New England is the only North American region to inherit the name of a kingdom in the British Isles  New England has largely preserved its regional character  especially in its historic places  Today  the region is more ethnically diverse  having seen waves of immigration from Ireland  Quebec  Italy  Portugal  Poland  Asia  Latin America  Africa  other parts of the U S   and elsewhere  The enduring European influence can be seen in the region  from use of traffic rotaries to the bilingual French and English towns of northern Vermont  Maine  and New Hampshire  as innocuous as the sprinkled use of British spelling  and as obvious as the region s heavy prevalence of English town and county names  and its unique  often non rhotic coastal dialect reminiscent of southeastern England  Within New England  there are many town  and a few county  names that repeat from state to state  primarily due to settlers throughout the region naming their new towns after their old ones

American English accents spoken in the region including New England English and Boston Accent  The often parodied Boston accent is native to the region  Many of its most stereotypical features  such

movies like Good Will Hunting and The Departed  The Boston accent and accents closely related to it cover eastern Massachusetts  New Hampshire  and Maine  147  Some Rhode Islanders speak with a non

Vermont  153  In Connecticut  Litchfield  Fairfield  and New Haven counties it also broadcasts New York based news programs this is due in part to the immense influence New York has on this region s economy and culture  and also to give Connecticut broadcasters the ability to compete with overlapping media coverage from New York area broadcasters  NESN broadcasts the Boston Red Sox baseball and Boston Bruins hockey throughout the region  save for Fairfield County  Connecticut  154  Most of Connecticut  save for Tolland and Windham counties in the state s northeast corner  and even southern
