Howard had been in search of a new character to market to the burgeoning pulp outlets of the early 1930s  In October 1931  he submitted the short story  People of the Dark  to Clayton Publications  new magazine  Strange Tales of Mystery and Terror  June 1932    People of the Dark  is a remembrance story of  past lives   and in its first person narrative the protagonist describes one of his previous incarnations  Conan  a black haired barbarian hero who swears by a deity called Crom  Some Howard scholars believe this Conan to be a forerunner of the more famous character  2  In February 1932  Howard vacationed at a border town on the lower Rio Grande  During this trip  he further conceived the character of Conan and also wrote the poem  Cimmeria   much of which echoes specific passages in Plutarch s Lives  citation needed  According to some scholars  Howard s conception of Conan and the Hyborian Age may have originated in Thomas Bulfinch s The Outline of Mythology  1913  which inspired Howard to  coalesce into a coherent whole his literary aspirations and the strong physical  autobiographical elements underlying the creation of Conan   2  Having digested these prior influences after he returned from his trip  Howard rewrote the rejected story  By This Axe I Rule    May 1929   replacing his existing character Kull of Atlantis with his new hero  and retitling it  The Phoenix on the Sword   Howard also wrote  The Frost Giant s Daughter   inspired by the Greek myth of Daphne  citation needed  and submitted both stories to Weird Tales magazine  Although  The Frost Giant s Daughter  was rejected  the magazine accepted  The Phoenix on the Sword  after it received the requested polishing  2   The Phoenix on the Sword  appeared in Weird Tales cover dated December 1932  Editor Farnsworth Wright subsequently prompted Howard to write an 8 000 word essay for personal use detailing  the Hyborian Age   the fictional setting for Conan  Using this essay as his guideline  Howard began plotting  The Tower of the Elephant   a new Conan story that would be the first to truly integrate his new conception of the Hyborian world  2  The publication and success of  The Tower of the Elephant  would spur Howard to write many more Conan stories for Weird Tales  By the time of Howard s suicide in 1936  he had written 21 complete stories  17 of which had been published  as well as a number of unfinished fragments  2  Following Howard s death  the copyright of the Conan stories passed through several hands  Eventually  under the guidance of L  Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter  the stories were expurgated  revised and sometimes rewritten  For roughly forty years  the original versions of Howard s Conan stories remained out of print  The book publisher Berkley in 1977 made an attempt made to return to the earliest published Weird Tales form of the texts  citation needed  but these failed to displace the edited versions  In the 1980s and 1990s  the copyright holders of the Conan franchise permitted Howard s stories to go out of print entirely  citation needed  while continuing to sell Conan works by other authors  In 2000  the British publisher Gollancz Science Fiction issued a two volume  complete edition of Howard s Conan stories as part of its Fantasy Masterworks imprint  which including several stories that had never seen print in their original form  The Gollancz edition mostly used the versions of the stories as published in Weird Tales  citation needed  In 2003  another British publisher  Wandering Star  made an effort both to restore Howard s original manuscripts and to provide a more scholarly and historical view of the Conan stories  It published hardcover editions in England  which were republished in the United States by the Del Rey imprint of Ballantine Books  The first book  Conan of Cimmeria  Volume One  1932 1933   2003  published in the US as The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian  includes Howard s notes on his fictional setting  as well as letters and poems concerning the genesis of his ideas  This was followed by Conan of Cimmeria  Volume Two  1934   2004  published in the US as The Bloody Crown of Conan  and Conan of Cimmeria  Volume Three  1935 1936   2005  published in the US as The Conquering Sword of Conan   these were published in the US in 2005 as The Bloody Crown of Conan and The Conquering Sword of Conan  respectively  Among them  the three books include all of the original  unedited Conan stories   edit  Setting A map of Robert E  Howard s Hyborian Age  Main article  Hyborian Age The various stories of Conan the Barbarian occur in the fictional  Hyborian Age   set after the destruction of Atlantis and before the rise of the known ancient civilizations  This is a specific epoch in a fictional timeline created by Howard for many of the low fantasy tales of his artificial legendary  3  The reasons behind the invention of the Hyborian Age were perhaps commercial  Howard had an intense love for history and historical dramas  however  at the same time  he recognized the difficulties and the time consuming research work needed in maintaining historical accuracy  By conceiving a timeless setting    a vanished age    and by carefully choosing names that resembled human history  Howard shrewdly avoided the problem of historical anachronisms and the need for lengthy exposition  2  According to  The Phoenix on the Sword   the adventures of Conan take place     Between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and the gleaming cities  and the years of the rise of the Sons of Aryas     4   edit  Personality and character This section may contain original research  Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding references  Statements consisting only of original research may be removed  More details may be available on the talk page   November 2011  Conan is a Cimmerian  based on the ancient Indo European nomads of the same name and  somewhat loosely  on the Celts   a barbarian of the far north  One of his grandfathers  however  came from a southern tribe  He was born on a battlefield and is the son of a village blacksmith  Conan matured quickly as a youth and  by age fifteen  he was already a respected warrior who had participated in the destruction of the Aquilonian outpost of Venarium  After its destruction  he was struck by wanderlust and began the adventures chronicled by Howard  encountering skulking monsters  evil wizards  tavern wenches  and beautiful princesses  He roamed throughout the Hyborian Age nations as a thief  outlaw  mercenary and pirate  As he grew older  he began commanding larger units of men and escalating his ambitions  In his forties  he seized the crown of the tyrannical king of Aquilonia  the most powerful kingdom of the Hyborian Age  having strangled the previous ruler on the steps of the throne  Conan s adventures often result in him performing heroic feats  though his motivation for doing so is largely for his own survival or for personal gain   edit  Appearance Conan has  sullen  or  smoldering  blue eyes and a black  square cut mane   Howard once describes him as having a hairy chest and  while comic book interpretations often portray Conan as wearing a loincloth or other minimalist clothing  Howard describes the character as wearing whatever garb is typical for the land and culture in which Conan finds himself  Howard never gave a strict height or weight for Conan in a story  only describing him in loose terms like  giant  and  massive   5  In the tales no human is ever described as stronger than Conan  although several are mentioned as taller  such as the strangler Baal pteor  or of larger bulk  In a letter to P  Schuyler Miller and John D  Clark in 1936 only three months before Howard s death  Conan is described as standing 6 feet  1 8 m  and weighing 180 pounds  82 kg  when he takes part in an attack on Venarium at only 15 years old  though being far from fully grown  citation needed  Although Conan is muscular  Howard frequently compares his agility and way of moving to that of a panther  see  for instance   Jewels of Gwahlur    Beyond the Black River  or  Rogues in the House    His skin is frequently characterized as bronzed from constant exposure to the sun  In his younger years  he is often depicted wearing a light chain shirt and a horned helmet  though appearances vary with different artists  During his reign as king of Aquilonia  Conan was      a tall man  mightily shouldered and deep of chest  with a massive corded neck and heavily muscled limbs  He was clad in silk and velvet  with the royal lions of Aquilonia worked in gold upon his rich jupon  and the crown of Aquilonia shone on his square cut black mane  but the great sword at his side seemed more natural to him than the regal accoutrements  His brow was low and broad  his eyes a volcanic blue that smoldered as if with some inner fire  His dark  scarred  almost sinister face was that of a fighting man  and his velvet garments could not conceal the hard  dangerous lines of his limbs   6  Though several later authors have referred to Conan as  Germanic looking   Howard imagined the Cimmerians as a proto Celtic people with mostly black hair and blue or grey eyes  Ethnically the Cimmerians to which Conan belongs are descendants of the Atlanteans  though they do not remember their ancestry  In his fictional historical essay  The Hyborian Age   Howard describes how the people of Atlantis   the land where his character King Kull originated   had to move east after a great cataclysm changed the face of the world and sank their island  settling where Ireland and Scotland would eventually be located  Thus they are  in Howard s work  the ancestors of the Irish and Scottish  the Celtic Gaels  and not the Picts  the other ancestor of modern Scots who also appear in Howard s work  In the same work  Howard also described how the Cimmerians eventually moved south and east after the age of Conan  presumably in the vicinity of the Black Sea  where the historical Cimmerians dwelt    edit  Abilities This article needs additional citations for verification  Please help

brawn  The Cimmerian is a talented fighter  but his travels have given him vast experience in other trades  especially as a thief  he is also a talented commander  tactician and strategist  as well as a born leader  In addition  Conan speaks many languages  including advanced reading and writing abilities  in certain stories  he is able to recognize  or even decipher  certain ancient or secret signs and writings  He also has incredible stamina  enabling him to go without sleep for a few days  Another noticeable trait is his sense of humor  largely absent in the comics and movies but very much a part of Howard s original vision of the character  particularly apparent in  Xuthal of the Dusk   also known as  The Slithering Shadow   He is a loyal friend to those true to him  with a barbaric code of conduct that often marks him as more honorable than the more sophisticated people he meets in his travels  Indeed  his straightforward nature and barbarism are constants in all the tales  Conan is a formidable armed and unarmed combatant  With his back to the wall Conan is capable of engaging and killing opponents by the score  This is seen in several stories  such as  Queen of the Black Coast    The Scarlet Citadel  and  A Witch Shall be Born   Conan is not superhuman  though  he did need the providential help of Zelata s wolf to defeat four Nemedian soldiers in the story The Hour of the Dragon  Some of his hardest victories have come from fighting single opponents of inhuman strength  one such as Thak  the ape man from  Rogues in the House   or the strangler Baal Pteor in  Shadows in Zamboula   Conan is far from untouchable and has been captured and defeated several times  on one occasion knocking himself out drunkenly running into a wall    edit  Influences Main article  Robert E  Howard Howard frequently corresponded with H  P  Lovecraft  and the two would sometimes insert references or elements of each others  settings in their works  Later editors reworked many of the original Conan stories by Howard  thus diluting this connection  Nevertheless  many of Howard s unedited Conan stories are arguably part of the Cthulhu Mythos  7  Additionally  many of the Conan stories by Howard  de Camp and Carter used geographical place names from Clark Ashton Smith s Hyperborean Cycle   edit  Original Robert E  Howard Conan stories Cover of Weird Tales

Robert Jordan  Sean A  Moore  Bj rn Nyberg  Andrew J  Offutt  Steve Perry  John Maddox Roberts  Harry Turtledove  and Karl Edward Wagner  Some of these writers have finished incomplete Conan manuscripts by Howard  Others were created by rewriting Howard stories which originally featured entirely different characters from entirely different milieus  Most  however  are completely original works  In total  more than fifty novels and dozens of short stories featuring the Conan character have been written by authors other than Howard  Tales of Conan  Gnome Press  1955   Cover art by Ed Emshwiller  The Gnome Press edition  1950 1957  was the first hardcover collection of Howard s Conan stories  including all the original Howard material known to exist at the time  some left unpublished in his lifetime  The later volumes contain some stories rewritten by L  Sprague de Camp  like  The Treasure of Tranicos    including several non Conan Howard stories  mostly historical exotica situated in the Levant at the time of the crusades  which he turned into Conan yarns  The Gnome edition also issued the first Conan story written by an author other than Howard   the final

compiling the material from the Gnome Press series together in chronological order with all the remaining original Howard material  including that left unpublished in his lifetime and fragments and outlines  These were completed by de Camp and Carter  and new stories written entirely by the two were added as well  Lancer Books went out of business before bringing out the entire series  the publication of which was completed by Ace Books  Its covers featured dynamic images by Frank Frazetta that  for many fans  who   presented the definitive impression of Conan and his world  For decades to come  most other portrayals of the Cimmerian and his imitators were heavily influenced by the cover paintings of this series  citation needed  Editions after the Lancer Ace series have been of either the original Howard stories or Conan material by others  but not both  Notable later editions of the Howard stories include the Donald M  Grant editions  1974 1989   Berkley editions  1977

editions  1982 2004   Several of the Lancer Ace Conan versions are rewrites by de Camp and Carter of non Conan stories  For example  at least one El Borak in which the protagonist infiltrates the City of the assassins was rewritten with Conan replacing Francis Xavier Gordon and a supernatural element added   edit  Conan chronologies Main article  Conan chronologies In an attempt to provide a coherent timeline which fit the numerous adventures of Conan penned by Robert E  Howard and later writers  various  Conan chronologies  have been prepared by many people from the 1930s onward  Note that no consistent timeline has yet accommodated every single Conan story  The following are the principal theories that have been advanced over the years  Miller Clark chronology   A Probable Outline of Conan s Career  1936  was the first effort to put the tales in chronological order  Completed by P  Schuyler Miller and John D  Clark  the chronology was later revised by Clark and L  Sprague de Camp in An Informal Biography of Conan the Cimmerian  1952   Robert Jordan chronology   A Conan Chronology by Robert Jordan  1987  was a new chronology written by Conan writer Robert Jordan that included all written Conan material up to that point  It was heavily influenced by the Miller Clark de Camp chronologies  though it departed from them in a number of idiosyncratic instances  William Galen Gray chronology   Timeline of Conan s Journeys  1997  rev  2004   was fan William Galen Gray s attempt to create  a chronology of all the stories  both Howard and pastiche   Drawing on the earlier Miller Clark and Jordan chronologies  it represents the ultimate expression of their tradition to date  Joe Marek chronology   Joe Marek s chronology is limited to stories written  or devised  by Howard  though within that context it is essentially a revision of the Miller Clark tradition to better reflect the internal evidence of the stories and avoid forcing Conan into what he perceives as a  mad dash  around the Hyborian world within timeframes too rapid to be credible  Dale Rippke chronology   The Darkstorm Conan Chronology  2003  was a completely revised and heavily researched chronology  radically repositioning a number of stories and including only those stories written or devised by Howard  The Dark Horse comic series follows this chronology   edit  Media See also  Adaptations of works by Robert E  Howard  edit  Films  edit  Arnold Schwarzenegger films Main articles  Conan the Barbarian  1982 film  and Conan the Destroyer Conan the Barbarian  1982  poster  The very first Conan cinematic project was planned by Edward Summer  Summer envisioned a series of Conan movies  much like the James Bond franchise  He outlined six stories for this film series  but none were ever made  An original screenplay by Summer and Roy Thomas was written  but their lore authentic screen story was never filmed  However  the resulting film  Conan the Barbarian  1982   was a creative mixture of screenwriters  Oliver Stone and John Milius ideas as well as plots from Conan stories  written also by Howard s successors  notably Lin Carter and L  Sprague de Camp   The addition of Nietzschean motto and Conan s life philosophy were crucial for bringing the spirit of Howard s literature to the screen  The plot of Conan the Barbarian  1982  begins with Conan being enslaved by the Vanir raiders of Thulsa Doom  a malevolent warlord who is responsible for the slaying of Conan s parents and the genocide of his people  Later  Thulsa Doom becomes a cult leader of a shamanist religion that worships Set  a Snake God  The vengeful Conan  the archer Subotai and the thief Valeria set out on a quest to rescue a princess held captive by Thulsa Doom  The film was directed by John Milius and produced by Dino De Laurentiis  The character of Conan was played by Arnold Schwarzenegger and was his break through role as an actor  8  This film was followed by a less popular sequel  Conan the Destroyer in 1984  9  This sequel was a more typical fantasy genre film and was even less faithful to Howard s Conan stories   edit  Conan the Conqueror  cancelled  The third film in the Conan trilogy was planned for 1987 to be titled Conan the Conqueror  The director was to be either Guy Hamilton or John Guillermin  However Arnold Schwarzenegger was committed to the film Predator and De Laurentiis s contract with the star had expired after his obligation to Red Sonja and Raw Deal and he wasn t keen to negotiate a new one  thus the third Conan movie sank into development hell  The script was eventually turned into Kull the Conqueror   edit  Conan the Barbarian  2011  Main article  Conan the Barbarian  2011 film  There were rumours in the late 1990s of another second Conan sequel  a story about an older Conan titled King Conan  Crown of Iron  but Schwarzenegger s election in 2003 as governor of California ended this project  10 Warner Bros  spent seven years trying to get the project off the ground  with development attempts made by Lana and Andy Wachowski  John Milius  and Robert Rodriguez who was closest to completing development but left the project for Grindhouse  Boaz Yakin was hired in 2006 to start again  However  in June 2007 the rights reverted to Paradox Entertainment  though all drafts made under Warner remained with them  Paradox s CEO  Fredrik Malmberg  told Variety  we have great respect for Warner Bros   but after seven years  we came to the point where we needed to see progress to production   Paradox were auctioning the rights after and various groups took interest in producing  including New Line Cinema  Hollywod Gang  and Millennium Films  11  Due to development time frustrations felt when the rights were with Warner  Malmberg made deal terms where he was asking for  1 million for a one year option  with another  1 million for each year s renewal  In August 2007  it was announced that Millennium had acquired the right to the project in an unrevealed seven figure deal  with Malmberg and Millennium s Avi Lerner  Boaz Davidson  Joe Gatta and George Furla set to produce  The deal was brokered by Gatta  who originally made the deal between Paradox and Warner in 2002  Production was aimed for a Spring 2006 start  with the intention of having stories more faithful to the Robert E  Howard creation  12  In November 2008  The Hollywood Reporter  based on a press release from Lerner  reported that Brett Ratner was committed to direct Conan  an update changed this to state he was in final negotiations  13  14  Days later  however  Ratner announced   I am not doing  Conan  now  This is totally premature  For now   Conan  is only a development deal  13  In June 2009  Nu Image Millennium Films hired Marcus Nispel to direct  15  In January 2010  Jason Momoa was selected for the role of Conan  16  In February 2010  on the eve of production  Sean Hood was brought in to retool the screenplay  17   edit  Animated film An animated feature  Conan  Red Nails  based upon the novella of the same name  was partially completed but appears to have stalled  18   edit  Television There have been three television series related to Conan  A live action TV series and animated cartoon series   both entitled Conan the Adventurer  as well as a second animated series entitled Conan and the Young Warriors  Conan The Adventurer was the name of a popular animated television series  Produced by Jetlag Productions and Sunbow Productions  the series debuted on October 1  1992  ran for 64 episodes and concluded exactly two years later  on October 1  1994  The series involved Conan chasing Serpent Men across the world in an attempt to release his parents from eternal imprisonment as living statues  Conan and the Young Warriors was an animated television series which premiered in 1994 and ran for 13 episodes  DiC Entertainment produced the show and CBS aired this series as a spin off to the previous Conan the Adventurer animated series  This cartoon took place after the finale of Conan the Adventurer with Wrath Amon vanquished and Conan s family returned to life from living stone  Conan soon finds that the family of one of his friends are being turned into wolves by an evil sorceress and he must train three warriors in order to aid him in rescuing them  Conan  The Adventurer was a television series loosely based on Conan  The TV show premiered on September 22  1997  and ran for 22 episodes  This live action series starred German bodybuilder Ralf M ller as Conan and Danny Woodburn as his sidekick Otli  The storyline was quite different from the Conan lore of Robert E  Howard  In this adaptation  Conan is a pleasant and jovial person  Also in this version  Conan is not a loner but one member in a merry band of adventurers   edit  Comics Tower of the Elephant comic by R  Thomas  J  Buscema and A  Alcala  Main article  Conan  comics  Conan the Barbarian has appeared

 However  since Robert E  Howard published his Conan stories at a time when the date of publication was the marker  1932 through 1963   and any new owners failed to renew them to maintain the
