different techniques and images which a comic book artist employs in order to convey a narrative within the medium of comics  This vocabulary forms a language variously identified as sequential art  graphic storytelling  pictorial stories  visual language or comics  Whilst scholars have yet to unite on a term to define the language  the communicative tools of that language have been formalised in works by authors such as Will Eisner  Scott McCloud and Mort Walker  Contents 1 Creative team 1 1 Writer 1 2 Artist 1 2 1 Penciler 1 2 2 Inker 1 2 3 Colorist 1 2 4 Other 1 3 Letterer 1 4 Editor 1 5

creation of a particular book or story  However  creators  can also refer to the individuals who first wrote drew a particular character or title  For example  the character of Superman was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster  but while they are that character s  creators   they are not per se the creators creative team of every title featuring him  The  creative team  usually refers to two main roles  with around four subsidiary ones  Primarily  the term refers to the writer and artist  This latter term is usually used to refer to the penciler  but also includes the role of an inker and colorist  There is usually also a letterer involved in the hands on  creation  of a comic book  and then an editor behind the scenes  Any combination of these people  that includes the key roles of writer and artist  can reasonably be said to refer to a  creative team   The  term describes the individual s  who created the comic book in question  A writer  artist  letterer  and editor will usually be credited in the comic book  Note that these functions can be performed by one or more people  acting collectively or individually  A comic book may have one writer and multiple artists  for example  or may be the creation of a single person   1  The complete creative team on a small press  independent or self published comic will likely be smaller than that on a more mainstream title  At its most basic  the creative team can see just one person filling every necessary role  at its most complex it includes a considerably larger group   edit  Writer Main article  script  comics   The writer  naturally  writes the comic book  This is not  however limited to  writing the words in the balloons   as many newcomers often think  but rather requires developing and putting down on paper the entire story in such a way that the artist can then interpret it into visuals for the reader  It is possible to have multiple writers on a single comic book  Sometimes one writer will plot the comic  and a second will write the dialogue after the fact  In other cases  many writers may plot a comic book together  with one of them  or another writer  supplying the dialogue   2  Moreover  the writer can be two  or more  individuals working as a team  Also  it is worth noting that while most writers do indeed produce a full script detailing  in addition to the actual words   and in a similar way to a screenplay  actions  thoughts  motives  expressions  etc  often in a panel by panel  page by page form to guide the artist  some writers like Alan Moore are famed for describing in their scripts precisely how the artist should draw each individual part of every scene   some do not  Most famously  the Stan Lee instigated  Marvel Method   below  saw the writer s role reduced solely to writing the words  leaving the burden of storytelling with the artist   edit  Artist Comics are usually a collaboration between different individuals  typically a writer and an several artists  Broadly the term  artist  is used interchangeably with penciler  since it is almost always the penciler who produces the initial artwork  and provides the bulk of the artwork  Hence the writer and artist  penciler  are usually said to be the exclusive authors of a particular comic  even though there are usually other individuals involved in the creative process  A general breakdown of a comics   artists  includes three roles  often   but not always   provided by three separate individuals teams  Alysson Lyga puts it thus   Historically  the three functions were performed by three individuals separate from the writer and were distinct job titles   3  The three titles roles jobs are   edit  Penciler Main article  Penciler The role of the penciler is  for most comics  excepting  for example  fully painted comics  the primary artistic chore  and hence the penciler is usually referred to as the  Artist   The term refers to the fact that initial artwork is done in pencil  so that mistakes can be corrected and so that the layout is not set in stone immediately  Some artists choose to work in ink immediately  some do their own inking  many nowadays draw on a computer via a wacom tablet  sidestepping the need for actual pencils in favour of digital pencils   A penciler does the initial work of laying out the page based on the script  He or she creates each panel  places the figures and settings in the panels  etc   3   edit  Inker Main article  Inker The role of the inker is to supplement and enhance the pencil artwork  The purpose of inking was initially to define the artwork both for the colorist and for the printing process  Many artists work with a single inker  or small group of inkers  who best accentuate their art style  Some artists also provide their own inks  but the separation of the roles both speeds up production  particularly vital on a monthly schedule  and allows a buffer stage for editorial or other art changes  With the advent of computer art  some modern  pencil  computer artwork is  digitally darkened    i e  the gray pencil lines are darkened to imitate the inking stage   bypassing the role of an inker  This ignores the role of the separate inking stage  and often the separate individual who carries out the inking   where artwork can be added to or refined   The penciled pages are then passed to an inker  who uses black ink to render the pencils into fuller  rounder tones  The inker usually adds depth and shadow to the images   a good inker will bring out and enhance the strengths of a penciler s artwork   3   edit  Colorist Main article  Colorist The role of the colorist is to add color to the artwork  either by hand or on computer  Historically  the colorist  and the inker  would work directly on the original artwork  but modern advances mean that the coloring  and sometimes inking  is now done digitally on a computer  and hence can be refined and changed with comparative ease  The colorist will often make the ultimate decision over palette  color scheme   adding to the tone of the book   Muted    Pastel  and  Technicolor  color schemes can change the whole tone and feel of a comic  and is a key part in comics production  despite being arguably the most over looked artistic role   edit  Other The artistic roles on comics can  of course  be filled by any number of individuals  from one to an almost indefinite number  The writer artist  e g  Will Eisner  Frank Miller  Darwyn Cooke  typically combines the two roles of writer and penciler  but can also incorporate the role of inker as well  More commonly  the pencils and inks may be produced by the same individual on some  or all  of their projects  Some comics feature more than one writer  penciler  inker or colorist  and some feature individuals  often uncredited  who  ghost  work in the style of a particular artist  or work as a background artist  working with  or for  an artist who might only draw certain figures  panels or scenes  leaving the rest to their collaborator  The role of colorist is more likely to be a role filled by a separate individual to the rest of the artwork  although some artists do provide their own colors  most typically those who work digitally   In addition  Some   c omics are produced in black and white  with gray tones instead of colors  etc  Some comics are painted in full color  rendering further artists moot   3   In recent years  studios and companies such as Digital Chameleon and Comicraft are credited with  for example  colors and lettering  with the credit given to the company studio and not a specific individual within that company   edit  Letterer The role of the letterer is usually separate to the role of writer and  all individuals under the catch all term of  artist  and refers to   t he individual who places word balloons and captions on the finished artwork and fills them with words based on the script   4  Typically this is the last stage in a comic book s production  although the letterer may liaise with the artist initially to make sure there will be space to fit the speech bubbles into the artwork without obscuring too much any of it   Letterers also often provide the sound effects prevalent in comics though sometimes the artist will render them   4  The lettering in a comic is usually designed to be unobtrusive  5  and in some cases  e g  The Sandman  is used cleverly to differentiate between different characters  Richard Starkings  company Comicraft provides lettering services  and also supplies digital fonts for letterers  by a number of individuals under a collective credit   edit  Editor The editor of a particular comic  and there are usually  for larger companies at least  many tiers of individual editors  group editors and head editors  is the  individual charged with the editorial functions   typically implying that the editor has  broad control over the content and direction of the story    shepherds the creative process  or may function as an  extra set of eyes  to catch errors and glitches in the process  or any combination thereof  1  The editor is often the individual who shoulders the responsibility  be that for continuity errors or story glitches  late comics or  perceived or actual  mismanagement of a creative team  Some editors work by dictating the broad or specific direction of a title or story arc while others give their writers artists free rein  Typically the editor on a work for hire project  i e  one where the writer artist does not own the character whose story they are telling  will have more direct influence over and input to the story than would the editor of a creator owned title  Many comics have a specific editor over seeing a specific story  who is answerable to a  Group Editor  who may be responsible for a number of titles  perhaps linked in theme  This individual will ultimately be answerable to an Executive Editor Editor in Chief   edit   Cartoonist   Cartoonist  is a very broad term  sometimes  used by many artists who perform multiple tasks in the creation of a comic  including the writing    with the implication that the work is predominantly the creation of a single vision   3  In mainstream comics  however   cartoon art  is seen as less realistic  citation needed  so the term  cartoonist  is usually best applied to representative artists and artwork  i e  newspaper strips such as Garfield and Peanuts  and many alternative comics  where the characters cannot be said to have an overly realistic look to them   and so applies to relatively few modern  mainstream comics  citation needed   edit  Comics  comix and graphic novels  edit  Comic book Main article  Comic book The generic and most common term for the individual issues of a particular series  and the format in which they are presented   Traditionally  a comic book was a stapled  magazinelike product that told a serialized story or anthologized many stories over a period of months and years  The term has evolved to describe any format that uses the combination of words and pictures to convey a story  and thus is accurate when applied to both the medium itself and the periodical form  As a result  all graphic novels are comic books  but not all comic books are graphic novels   1  The term is sometimes seen as an awkward  not least because of the cultural baggage tied up both in comics  origins in childish  humorous stories  hence  comic    and in the negative associations forced upon them in the 1950s by senate hearings and Fredric Wertham  Comics are thus often alternately and in contradictory fashion seen as solely for children  and not for children at all   edit  Comic strip Main article  Comic strip Comic strip generally refers to daily and Sunday newspaper features widely syndicated during the past century  Many comic strips have been collected into comic books  paperbacks and hardcover books   edit  Comics Main article  Comics  The plural of comic is typically used as a singular  as  politics  is  to refer to the entire medium or industry  Hence  comics industry  or  comics creators   This is usually employed to avoid the unintentional consequences of using the adjective  comic   which implies comedic content   For example   the comic industry  might be misinterpreted as meaning  an industry that is funny   while  the comics industry  can mean only  the industry that creates comic books     1   edit  Comix Main article  Underground comix See  Alternative Comics  Independent Comics Underground  and Alternative  Comics or Comix were born both out of the general 1960s counter culture  and as a part reaction to the Comics code induced censorship of all mainstream comics inspired by the hysteria surrounding Dr Wertham s seminal book Seduction of the Innocent  1954   which was interpreted as labelling comics partially or wholly responsible for juvenile delinquency   A word coined in the 1960s to describe titles that nowadays would be considered alternative  The comix were titles created as a reaction to the juvenilization of comics compelled by Congress in the 1950s   1  As a result of the sanitisation of mainstream comics  most underground comix dealt with themes of sex  drugs and politics  and were propagated through so called head shops   edit  Pamphlet  Periodical  Monthly  Floppy  Single  Issue These terms are all used interchangeably by fans to describe individual comics  They   describe the original comic book form  that of a slim  magazinelike periodical  not designed for long term use or wear and tear  The term  Pamphlet  is considered derisive by some   6  Periodical evokes magazines  and is less widely used  but arguably most accurately describes the serial nature of on going comics  Monthly likewise is tied to the historically common release time of most comics  while floppy simply describes the spineless nature of comics  as opposed to collections   and single denotes their place as parts of continuing narratives   Comic  is still a simpler term   edit  Graphic novel   GN    OGN Main article  Graphic novel The term  Graphic novel   simply put a novel conveyed in pictures  is   Used to describe the specific format of a comic book that has greater production values and longer narrative   7  The term became popularised when titles such as Dark Knight Returns  Maus and Watchmen began to break into the  non comics   mainstream   and from that point forwards has been more or less conflated and confused  erroneously  with trade paperback  Graphic novels are comic books  Mr  Koren is wrong  For that reason  the qualifying  Original   hence  OGN   is often added to the front of the term when describing a story told through the medium of comics which debuts in the higher production values  increasingly as a hardback  almost always with a spine  format   The graphic novel is more like a traditional novel  in that it is published on an independent schedule  It is longer in format than a periodical and typically contains a complete story unto itself  Graphic novels usually have higher production values than the typical stanpled comic book  they may be squarebound  for example  with cardstock covers  Some may be hardcover volumes  Although a graphic novel usually stands on its own as a complete story  it is possible to have an ongoing series or limited series of graphic novels telling a single story or series of related stories  A typical abbreviation in the industry for graphic novel is  GN   usually used as part of a title to indicate to a reader or browser that the title in question is not a periodical   7  The term OGN is   a n abbreviation for original graphic novel  often used to differentiate a graphic novel that contains a wholly new story from a trade paperback   6   edit  Motion comic Main article  Motion comic A motion comic is  a hybrid of comic books and animation   8  based on the actual panels of a comic  Examples include DC Comics  Watchmen  Motion Comics  Peanuts Motion Comics and Marvel Comics  Spider Woman   edit  Trade paperback  collection  collected edition Main article  Trade paperback  comics  Not to be confused  although it usually is  with  Graphic Novel  Trade paperback collections are compendiums of individual issues of particular comics   A comic book trade paperback is a squarebound edition that collects and reprints a mini series  maxi series  or story arc in this sturdier format  giving readers a complete story at one time rather than over a period of months  Sometimes a trade paperback may collect stories that are not interconnected but rather are related by some theme  Many trade paperbacks also contain additional material  such as an introduction or foreword  interview  or character sketches   2  Comics series such as Dark Knight Returns and Watchmen are thus not  Graphic novels   but  trade paperbacks    as they debuted in single issue format  and were only subsequently collected  The trade paperback is rapidly becoming the format of choice for many readers  and are  by their nature  more readily available  in bookshops as well as specialist comic book shops  Their benefits include  typically  containing a complete story  rather than a single part of one  as most on going monthly series  are  Another benefit is that typically a trade paperback is greatly less expensive than collecting the issues separately   edit  Prestige format   Bookshelf format Main article  Prestige format Prestige format   Bookshelf format describes the manner in which some  usually one shot  titles are printed and bound  Most are 48  or 64 pages in length  and tend to have a  thin  spine  They are broadly synonymous with  mini  Original Graphic Novels  and are almost always longer than a normal comic book  which tend to be either 22 or 32 pages in length  depending in most cases on whether advertisements are included in the pagecount    edit  Outside the comic  edit   Alternative comics  Describes a certain type  or genre of comics  although alternative comics can also be cross genre   and tends to merely imply  non Superhero   The term  alternative  is   used as an adjective  usually to describe anything that is not mainstream  Its use connotes a qualitative difference in storytelling styles  subject matter  and form  It comes from the dominance of the large  corporate publishers  causing smaller publishers to label themselves as the  alternative  reading choice   3   edit  Fanboy or Fangirl Main article  Fanboy The term  Fanboy   usually used as a pejorative term   although many described individuals wear it as a badge of honour 9   describes the anal retentive nature of extreme comics fans  It signifies a complete immersion in the world of comics  comics trivia and so forth   edit   The Marvel Method  Main article  Marvel Method The  Marvel method  is a manner of writing comics popularised in the 1960s by Stan Lee  with his artistic collaborators  in particular Jack Kirby  in large part simply to speed up the process  Rather than producing a full script   typically  the writer and artist would talk over a rough plot outline  and then the artist would produce the full comics worth of pages  The writer would then add dialogue to the artwork after it was done  rather than the other way around  This method of working is still used occasionally  particularly by artist plotters Keith Giffen and Alex Ross  Its use in the creation of the vast majority of Marvel s 1960s key output  has drawn considerable criticism and created large amounts of confusion  since it clouds the issue of who did what  Artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko  for example  have alleged that the actual input from  writer  Lee was minimal  and that it was regularly completely left to the artist to produce the plot and story  even as the writer was given most of the credit   edit  Continuity Further information  Continuity  fiction  Comics continuity almost always refers to the existence and use of a shared universe  although any comic can have internal continuity independent of this  Simply  the term describes a consistency of internal plot  and usually of characterisation and external references also  Initially  many comics were stand alone   done in one  stories with a beginning and end taking place within the confines of a single comic issue  often structured in chapters as are most novels  Over time  the comics companies realised the lucrative potential of the crossover comic  whereby other characters from a company s shared universe appeared in issues of each others  comics   This ultimately led to the formation of  team  books such as the Justice Society of America  Justice League of America and Avengers   During these crossover character interactions  editorial footnotes would often reference previous adventures and comics issues  but an actual editorially enforced  continuity  was not strictly adhered to  leading to some characters  actions appearing  out of character   or outrightly contradicting earlier plot points  As comics were deemed largely ephemeral items  this was not considered that much of a problem  until the full advent of comics fandom  As a result of fan reader scrutiny  the continuity both of individual characters and of the wider universes in which comics companies  characters interacted began to become more important  The Marvel  No Prize  became a humorous method by which readers could write letters to authors and editors pointing out mistakes or  continuity errors  in various comics  and were then named in print and awarded a  No Prize   in reality a coveted sheet of paper declaring itself a non prize   In 1985  cross universe continuity took on new levels of depth and  intended  consistency at the two main comics companies  DC and Marvel  Marvel launched its cross line toy driven event Secret Wars  which required all characters to undergo specific changes at specific times  and required considerable editorial dictates and conformity  DC launched the Crisis on Infinite Earths  one of the earliest maxi series   to address universe wide continuity and attempt to explain away  remove or revise all previous errors in continuity  The reader was reminded that the DC Multiverse consisted not merely of the core DC Universe  but of a number of different iterations of various heroes on a multitude of different planets  Companies and characters purchased by DC  such as the Charlton Comics characters and Captain Marvel  as well as older characters like the JSA were  re  assigned their own Earths  which were then destroyed and folded into one  core Earth  This naturally resulted in a number of contradictions and discrepancies in individual characters  histories  so a new  uniform continuity was created and the revised origins of the resulting heroes were retold in the hopes of maintaining consistent continuity  Naturally with hundreds of characters and dozens of writers  over the years uniform and consistent continuity is difficult to maintain  and most comics companies periodically address the erosion of internal consistency with big  events  designed to explain and simplify  although at times they do neither  discrepancies  and maintain continuity   edit  Canon Further information  Canon  fiction  Similar to internal continuity  the  canon  of comics characters universes is often subject to change  but refers to the stories which are  at any one point  part of the  official    accepted  history and story of particular characters universes  Alternate versions of characters  such as DC s Elseworlds and Marvel s speculative What if     titles  are necessarily not canon  However  stories can change from being non canonical to being accepted as canon   and vice versa  In particular  line wide continuity changing events  such as DC s Crises and Marvel s controversial recent Spider Man  One More Day storyline  retroactively affect which stories are part of a character universe s core canon  as they may revise or ignore previous events and happenings  For example  DC s Crisis on Infinite Earths addressed continuity and consistency errors over almost 50 years of comics publication  and retrofitted events and characters into the history of the DCU as if they had always been there   For example  the JSA went from being JLA contemporaries from a parallel world to being their earlier  historical counterparts some years previously   The Post Crisis DC Universe removed many stories from  official canon   explaining them as Imaginary Tales or ignoring them completely   edit  Retcon Main article  Retroactive continuity Retcon or  Ret con  is a portmanteau shorthand phrase for  retroactive continuity   and is the descriptive term used to explain continuity  and canon effecting stories  A retcon affects the past history of characters and or the whole shared universe  and says that the  new  changed events have always been that way  This can lead to intense confusion  as compounded events can cause even the most knowledgeable fanboy to falter over what is currently the accepted canon  Linked  retrofit  retroactively embedding something  usually a plot point or subsidiary character  into a past story  for the purposes of a current story  This can give added weight to a story  implying that the impetus for a current story had been around for some time   edit  Pre  and post Crisis Main article  Crisis  DC Comics  Labels referring to DC Universe continuity and canon  with the separator being the 1985 ret con event Crisis on Infinite Earths  Simply  Pre Crisis stories were not as stringently policed or edited  and often contained errors and internal inaccuracies  in large part because of their frequent nature as one shot stories  rather than linked tales designed to follow evolving and changing characters   Pre Crisis stories are often seen as throwaway and frivolous  perceived to be dominated by imaginary tales and  camp  characterisation  Neither label is entirely accurate  nor is the broad brush assumption that a lack of cohesive continuity denotes a complete disregard for it  The Post Crisis DCU is that which was formed in the pages of the CoIE maxi series  and is  or was intended to be  far more internally consistent and interlinked  Characters  origins were revised and updated  conflating previous stories and origins into one  accepted canonical one  Writer artist John Byrne s Superman  The Man of Steel mini series  for example  provided the post Crisis origin of Kal El  while Crisis architects Marv Wolfman and George P rez produced the two issue History of the DC Universe to briefly detail a broad overview of the post Crisis DCU  showing the sequence of events as well as the revised origins of many characters  later to be fleshed out in their own series   Even the post Crisis DCU was not without its continuity problems  however  and several subsequent events have attempted to address them  making the  post Crisis  label largely defunct  However  because of the 1985 maxi series s landmark status  the label persists in one form or another   edit  Events A comics  event  describes a large storyline which almost always involves a crossover between one or more characters  titles  universes or companies  but usually denotes an internal company crossover  These then typically fall into two broad categories  character or universe events  i e  a Batman  event  will likely only feature the Batman family of characters  an example would be the Batman  Knightfall storylines   while a multi character crossover will usually be universe wide and affect several different individuals  an example would be Marvel s Civil War event  which affected almost every character and title in their shared universe   Cross Universe events and inter company events are considerably rarer  but do happen  1996 s DC vs  Marvel event saw the DCU and MU brought together  and ultimately  briefly  merged   while the DC Universe has also featured in events crossovers with  for example  the WildStorm and Milestone universes   edit  DCU  MU  Earth 1  Earth 616 See also  DC Universe and Marvel Universe The concept of a shared universe  wherein a company s diverse cast of characters are able to interact and crossover between books and events is usually labelled the     Universe   DC  Marvel  Image  CrossGen  Valiant  etc    Comics fandom has produced various shorthand ways of referring to the various universes  however  and the comics themselves also refer to themselves in specific ways  These labels are usually reserved for the universes of  the Big Two   Marvel and DC   in large part because they are the main American comics publishers and have the largest shared universes  A non exhaustive list of terms includes  The Marvel Universe  sometimes abbreviated to the MU  The shared universe in which the X Men  Spider Man and Avengers  etc  all exist and interact Earth 616  The Six One Six  etc  denotes the numerical designation of the Earth which the Marvel Universe inhabits  The term was coined in the pages of Captain Britain  by either Alan Moore or Dave Thorpe and may have been chosen for reasons of historical significance  10  wry commentary  11  or random choice  12 See also  Marvel Multiverse  The DC Universe or DCU refers to the shared universe inhabited by Batman  Superman  the Justice League of America  etc  Earth 1 was the Pre Crisis designation of the  main  DCU  in contrast to Earth 2  featuring the JSA   and latterly dozens of individual Earths which were home to a plethora of characters  and were destroyed in the Crisis on Infinite Earths maxi series  New Earth is the designation of the  main  DCU after the events on 2005 s mini series event Infinite Crisis  in which a revised Multiverse of 52 worlds was created  See also  DC Multiverse  Multiverse world lists  In addition to the core shared universe  some companies have subsidiary universes imprints  which can be part of the main universe  or can not be  or can be thoroughly confusing   DC Comics  mature readers  imprint Vertigo Comics  for example mainly publishes stand alone ongoing  mini  and maxi series  but also variously includes characters who were once part of the DCU  or have intereacted with it in such a way as to make them at least an honorary part of it  Characters such as The Sandman family of titles  Doom Patrol and Swamp Thing all began publication as part of the DCU  but have gradually drifted to a corner of it quite far removed  if still nominally a part  The WildStorm Universe  which was initially published by Image Comics  is now largely accepted as part of the wider DC Multiverse  but not part of the DCU proper  Similarly  the Ultimate Marvel Universe is not part of the 616  while the MAX Imprint is on the fringes in a similar way to the Vertigo DC interaction   edit  Crossover Main articles  Fictional crossover Comics and Intercompany crossover Crossovers can be both internal and between different universes and companies  At their most basic level  a crossover can refer simply to a character making a guest appearance in a different comic  e g  Daredevil  crossing over  into an issue of a Spider Man comics   but typically a  crossover  implies more than a simple appearance  and denotes a cohesive storyline spanning more than one title  often as part of an event  Thus when the JLA and JSA featured in a two part story beginning in the pages of one comic and concluding in the pages of the other  this is referred to as a crossover  Typically  crossovers are more than two issues in length  and often span multiple titles  rather than just two  For example  the X Men  Messiah Complex crossover event sees the storyline unfold over four X Men titles  as well as two one shot issues  Most crossovers occur within the confines of a shared universe  although crossovers between universes  and companies  see below   also occur  for example in the upcoming DC WildStorm  Dreamwar crossover event  N B  Crossover and Tie in issues are often confused  conflated and used interchangeably  This is inaccurate  Cross company or Intercompany crossovers occur when the characters of two different publishers  universes meet  and usually fight   see  comic book clich s    Usually this is in a non canonical event  although occasionally happenings can be referred to in mainstream continuity  e g  the character of Access appeared in a couple of DC comics issues independent of the DC Marvel intercompany crossover   The biggest and most famous example of intercompany crossovers are the irregular meetings of the DC and Marvel Universes  most notably in 1996 s crossover event DC Vs  Marvel Marvel Vs  DC  which threw all the DCU and MU characters together in one big event  which ultimately spun out into a series of merged character one shot issues co published between the companies as the Amalgam Comics line  Other crossovers include the irregular meetings between DCU characters and the Dark Horse licenced properties Aliens and Predator  or the various Marvel and DC character crossovers with Top Cow s Witchblade  Darkness  etc   edit  Tie in  guest appearance  guest star A tie in issue  usually involves a guest appearance of one sort or another  and occurs on the fringes of an independent storyline or event  Different from a full fledged crossover issue  the two are often confused   and  indeed  if ill plotted or written are difficult to tell apart  Whereas a crossover issue plays an integral part in furthering the plot  a tie in simply expands upon a minor point  side issue or tangential but somehow linked story  which is not required by the reader to fully comprehend the plot of the main storyline event  but nevertheless enhances it or creates greater depth  A guest appearance is when a character not normally associated with a specific title book appears briefly  or sometimes for several issues  appears there  Often  somewhat cynically  if accurately  seen as a money making move by publishers to boost flagging sales by inserting a popular character into a lesser selling book  and in particular  it seems  Wolverine   a guest appearance may be a throwaway occurrence  may further the plot  or may be part of an event  crossover or tie in  The character who puts in a guest appearance is  reasonably enough  also known as a guest star   edit  Shared universe The concept of a shared universe is one in which a multitude of different characters co exist and or interact  Typically this concept confines itself to one publishing company s output  although concepts such as the Wold Newton family extend the boundaries considerably   and it is most common in the main superhero universes of DC and Marvel  The benefit of having a shared universe is that characters can make  sales boosting  guest appearances and allow for team ups between different characters  as well as allowing the  team  concept  JLA  Avengers  etc   to exist at all  Stan Lee s initial Marvel Universe creations in the 1960s best exemplify the  shared universe  concept  whereby characters  and villains  would feature across multiple titles  sometimes in the foreground of the story  sometimes as cameos in passing  but always underlining the interlinkedness of the universe   edit  Cover date  publication date Main article  Cover date Most comics include a  cover date  on their covers  but this is rarely the actual date of publication  even though it can easily be referred to as such  not least for ease of reference  Much like magazines  which are typically cover dated a month ahead  most comics are cover dated a couple of months ahead of their being published  The reasons behind this date back to comics being available on a newsstand  rather than through the direct market in a comic shop   This month was not the month the book went on sale  it was the month the issue was to be removed from the newsstand in the event the book did not sell   13   edit  Origins A character s  origin  is the fictional story which describes  almost always solely for Superheroes  how they came to be  gained their powers  arrived on Earth  were bitten by a radioactive spider  etc  Origins need not be established immediately  they can be told in flashback  or slowly over the course of several issues or  indeed  years  Origins are often subject to revision and ret cons  and may find themselves having additional information retrofitted in at a later time  They are also frequently updated to better reflect their times  For example  the origin of Iron Man has gradually been revised and updated  so that instead of serving in the Vietnam War  he serves in Korea or the  first  Gulf War   edit   One shot   stand alone issue   done in one  Main article  one shot  comics  Although  one shots  and  stand alone issues   sometimes referred to as  done in one  stories  refer to subtly different things  the two are similar in their design and intent  clarification needed     edit  Imaginary tales  Elseworlds  Alternates  Possible futures  What If     All these terms refer to specific and general  non canonical stories   often   but not exclusively   featuring alternate versions of established heroes and or events  For many years some DC comics would feature stories labelled as  Imaginary Tales   signifying that the events which occurred therein did not have an active effect on continuity  and therefore that anything could happen  even the bizarre and contradictory   This also meant that some seemingly bizarre or outrageous stories were deliberately labelled and described with the tagline   NOT a Hoax  Not an Imaginary Tale   to separate them from those which were non canonical   With 1989 s Gotham by Gaslight prestige format one shot  in which the story of Batman was re cast and set in the Victorian era  DC produced occasional titles which they labelled Elseworlds  to set them apart from the main DC Universe  These stories  and characters  can also be referred to by other names  but are most likely to be talked of Alternate World Universe stories counterparts  Some Imaginary Tales and Elseworlds have been assigned their own alternate  numbered  Earths in both the DC and Marvel Universe  others  like Frank Miller s dystopian Dark Knight Returns or Mark Waid  amp  Alex Ross  Kingdom Come have variously been considered pseudo canonical  as potentially in universe futures for their respective casts   Marvel Comics  main rival to the mainly DC preserve of alternate tales are their series  and one shots under the What If     banner  These tend to shy away from DC s Elseworlds stated method whereby  heroes are taken from their usual settings and put into strange times and places   some that have existed  and others that can t  couldn t or shouldn t exist    i e  in typically in self contained continuities  and are largely based on specific events or happenings  Most What If     stories changed one minor  or key  detail in a major Marvel event  and posited how events might have played in a mostly same universe situation    What if Spider Man joined the Fantastic Four    while many Elseworlds suggested what would happen if known heroes had existed in completely different situations  e g  Superman  Kal which grafts the Superman mythos onto the story of King Arthur   Some Imaginary Stories can be adapted into the accepted canon of a Universe  particularly possible futures  but also as taking place on parallel worlds which can then be interacted with   but it is most common for them to either stay completely separate  or even for some formerly canonical stories to be retconned into Imaginary Stories as after a major event  Thus some stories which may have once been  real  for the characters to whom the occurred can be retroactively said not to have happened  and thus that any memory of them is of an  Imaginary  tale   For a knowing take on retroactive continuity and Imaginary Tales  see Alan Moore s Supreme  The Story of the Year   edit  Direct market Main article  Direct market When comics were first launched  they could be purchased in many places  most particularly at the newsstand  alongside newspapers and magazines  In the 1980s  with comics sales on the wane  attempts were made  notably by convention organizer Phil Seuling  to buy comics direct from the publisher  rather than through a traditional magazine distributor  In addition  rather than returning unsold copies after a certain date  see  cover date   with a higher initial discount  buyers could keep unsold copies as back issue stock  This led to the formation of specialist shops   comic shops    with wide ranging stock of older issues  as well as the creation of a number of tailored comicbook distributors   edit  Specific comics terminology  edit  Panels Main article  Panel  comics  Varying panel size with sound effects  thought balloons  spiked balloon for radio speech  and narrative text on yellow background  Adventures Into Darkness  10  p  30  The images that are usually laid out within borders are known as panels  The layout of the panels can be in a grid  Watchmen was notable for utilizing a nine panel grid of three rows and three columns  Occasionally  Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons would use larger panels that broke the format of the grid to emphasize specific acts or points in the narrative  Other techniques of representation used within comics are  the speech bubble  the thought balloon  the narrative box  and the style of lettering  Flashback in lower panels  AtomicWar  3 p 17  A predominantly non rectangular division scheme  Rulah Jungle Goddess  24 p  8   edit  Panel frames The border or edges of a panel  when drawn  are called frames  These are normally rectangular in shape  but this shape can be altered to convey information to the reader  A cloud shaped panel can indicate a flashback or a dream sequence  whilst one with a jagged edge can be used to convey anger or shock  A panel without a frame is used to convey space  The frame itself can be formed by the image  For example  a scene can be framed by a door frame or by binoculars   edit  Bleed Full bleed is usually used on a comic book cover  and is when the art is allowed to run to the edge of each page  rather than having a white border around it  Bleeds are sometimes used on internal panels to create the illusion of space or emphasize action  This is more common in manga and modern comics   edit  Splash page Splash panel using 2 3 of page  Rulah Jungle Goddess  24  March 1949  Splash page or sometimes referred to simply as a  splash   is a full page drawing in a comic book  A splash page is often used as the first page of a story  and includes the title and credits  Splashes that are not on the first page of a story are sometimes called interior splash pages  Interior splashes may  or may not include titles and or credits  A panel that is larger than others on the page is called a splash panel  A splash that appears across two pages of a comic book is called a  double splash  or a two page spread  Rarely  splash pages will stretch over more than two pages  such multi page spreads often take the form of fold out posters  When used early in the issue  the splash provides a means of establishing characters or setting as well as draw the reader s attention  If used far later  it is commonly employed to dramatically portray the climax of a story  Rarely does an issue include more than two splash pages  14  however  Superman  75  Vol  2 is notable for consisting entirely of splashes   edit  Speech balloon  word balloon  speech bubble Main article  Speech balloon Spiked balloon indicating public address  Atomic War  1  November 1952   full page  The speech or word balloon  also known as a speech bubble   is a graphic used to assign ownership of dialogue on a particular character  Bubbles which represent an internal dialogue are referred to as  thought balloons   The shape of the balloon will indicate the type of dialogue contained  with thought balloons being more cloud like and connected to the owner by a series of small bubbles  Speech bubbles are more elliptical  although those used to represent screaming or anger tend to be spiky  and square boxes have been used to represent dialogue spoken by robots or computers  Whispers are usually represented by balloons made up of broken lines  Surprised thoughts in Japanese Manga are usually round and tend to spike out  Balloons such as radio  or TV  may be represtented by a spiked balloon  Certain creators are particularly renowned for their inventiveness with the format of the balloon  writer and artist Dave Sim  who also letters his own work   is particularly innovative with this aspect of the comic book   using particular balloons for drunkenness  echoes etc   edit  Captions See also  Speech balloon Thought balloon and narrative captions  Adventures Into Darkness  10  Comic book captions are a narrative device  often used to convey information that cannot be communicated by the art or speech  Captions can be used in place of thought bubbles  can be in the first  second  or third person  and can either be assigned to an independent narrator or one of the comics  characters  Simply put  they are   Boxes on a comic book page that contains text    While sometimes used to convey dialogue  they are more often used to impart a character s thoughts or as a narrative device   3  Like word balloons  they need not be of uniform shape  size  design or color  indeed  some modern comics use different colors to assign different textual captions to different characters   Motion lines  America s Best Comics  22   edit  Motion lines Main article  Motion lines Motion lines  also known as  speed lines   are lines that are used to represent motion  if a person or some other mobile object is moving such indicators of movement will follow in straight lines behind it  Line length may be said to vary proportionately to the rate of speed of the object moving  citation needed   edit  Gutter Gutter is the space between borders  Scott McCloud identified the gutter as one of the most important narrative tools in comics
