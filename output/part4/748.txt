of Los Angeles  The discovery led to the formation  in 1879  of the Pacific Coast Oil Company  also known as  Coast Oil    the oldest predecessor of Chevron Corporation  In 1895  Coast Oil initiated its enduring marine history when it launched California s first steel tanker  the George Loomis  which could ship 6 500 barrels of crude between Ventura and San Francisco  6  Coast Oil was acquired in 1900 by the Standard Oil Co   Iowa   a subsidiary of John D  Rockefeller s Standard Oil company  In 1906  Coast Oil was reincorporated as Standard Oil Co   California   Another side of the genealogical chart points to the founding of The Texas Fuel Company in 1901  a modest enterprise that started out in three rooms of a corrugated iron building in Beaumont  Texas  United States  This company was known as the Texas Company and later Texaco  In 1911  Standard Oil Co   California  was severed from its parent corporation  Standard Oil  as a result of the federal government s successful lawsuit against Standard Oil under the Sherman Antitrust Act  It went on to become part of the  Seven Sisters  that dominated the world oil industry in the early 20th century  In 1926  the company fixed its awkward parenthetical name by changing its name to Standard Oil Co  of California  or SoCal  7  8  In 1933  Saudi Arabia granted SoCal a concession to find oil  and oil was found in 1938  In 1948  SoCal discovered the world s largest oil field  Ghawar  in Saudi Arabia  9  SoCal s subsidiary  California Arabian Standard Oil Company  developed over years  to become the Arabian American Oil Company  ARAMCO  in 1944  In 1973  the Saudi government began buying into ARAMCO  By 1980  the company was entirely owned by the Saudis  and in 1988  the name was changed to Saudi Arabian Oil Company  Saudi Aramco   Standard Oil of California and Gulf Oil merged in 1984  the largest merger in history at that time  Under the antitrust regulation  SoCal divested many of Gulf s operating subsidiaries  and sold some Gulf stations and a refinery in the eastern United States  SoCal changed the name to Chevron Corporation  1  In January 1996  NGC  formerly NYSE  NGL  and Chevron announced plans to merge Chevron s natural gas and natural gas liquids business with NGC  On May 23  1996  the companies reached an agreement in principle to merge their business  Under the agreement  Chevron transferred its natural gas gathering  operating and marketing operation to NGC in exchange for a roughly 25 percent equity stake in NGC  On August 30  shareholders approved the deal creating North America s largest natural gas and gas liquids wholesaler  In 1998  NGC Corporation was renamed Dynegy  NYSE  DYN   10  11  In a merger completed February 1  2000  Illinova Corp   formerly NYSE  ILN  became a wholly owned subsidiary of Dynegy Inc   in which Chevron also took a 28  stake  12  However  Chevron in May 2007 sold its roughly 12 percent  at the time  Class A common stock in the company for approximately  985 million  resulting in a gain of  680 million  13  14  On October 15  2000 Chevron announced it would acquire Texaco  NYSE  TX  creating the second largest oil company in the United States and the world s fourth largest publicly traded oil company with a combined market value of approximately  95 billion  On October 9  2001  the shareholders of Chevron and Texaco voted to approve the merger creating ChevronTexaco  The deal was valued at  45 billion  15  16  17  On May 9  2005  ChevronTexaco announced it would drop the Texaco moniker and return to the Chevron name  Texaco remains as a brand under the Chevron Corporation  On April 4  2005  Chevron announced it planned to purchase Unocal Corporation  NYSE  UCL  for  18 4 billion increasing the company s petroleum and natural gas reserves by about 15 percent  On August 10  2005  Unocal Corporation shareholders approved Chevron s acquisition of the company  The deal was valued at  18 billion  18  19  Because of Unocal s large South East Asian geothermal operations  Chevron became the world s largest producer of geothermal energy  20  In July 2010  Chevron ended retail operations in the Mid Atlantic US  removing the Chevron and Texaco names from 1 100 stations in Delaware  Indiana  Kentucky  North Carolina  New Jersey  Maryland  Ohio  Pennsylvania  South Carolina  Virginia  West Virginia  Washington  D C   and parts of Tennessee  21  On November 9  2010  Chevron announced it would acquire Pennsylvania based Atlas Energy Inc   NASDAQ  ATLS  for  3 2 billion in cash and an additional  1 1 billion in existing debt owed by Atlas  On February 18  2011  the shareholders of Atlas energy voted to approve the merger  The deal was valued at  4 3 billion  22  23   edit  Overview Chevron employs

officers and crews from many different nations  30  The largest ships are 320 000 tonne Very Large Crude Carriers VLCCs which carry 2 million barrels  320 000 m3  of crude oil  The job of the international fleet is to transport crude oil from the oilfields to the refineries  The international fleet mans one LNG tanker  31  Chevron ships historically had names beginning with  Chevron   such as the Chevron Washington and Chevron South America  or were named after former or serving directors of the company  Samuel Ginn  William E Crain  Kenneth Derr  Richard Matzke and most notably Condoleezza Rice were amongst those honored  but the ship named after Rice was subsequently renamed as Altair Voyager  32  All the ships were renamed in 2001 following the corporate merger with Texaco  Ships in the international fleet are all named after celestial bodies or constellations  such as Orion Voyager and Altair Voyager and Capricorn Voyager  The US flagged ships are named after the states in the country  as in Washington Voyager and Colorado Voyager  Mississippi Voyager  Oregon Voyager and the California Voyager  33  34  Chevron is a signatory participant of the Voluntary

in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico  Key producing assets include Tahiti and Blind Faith  the company s deepest operated offshore production facility  Two major capital projects Jack St  Malo and Big Foot reached final investment decision in 2010  Blind Faith  which began production in 2008 is located in 6500 feet of water and is capable of producing up to 65 000 barrels of oil and 55 million cubic feet of natural gas each day  36  Blind Faith is named after Eric Clapton s short lived band of the same name  37  Chevron s Tahiti project began operations in 2009 after Chevron spent  4 7 billion developing the project following the discovery of the Tahiti field in 2002  38  The Tahiti project has total estimated recoverables of 400 500 million barrels of oil and gas equivalent and can produce up to 125 000 barrels of oil and 70 million cubic feet of gas a day  39  The Tahiti field is located almost 200 miles from New Orleans and is located in 4 100 feet of water  In 2010  Chevron sanctioned development plans for Big Foot  located in approximately 5 200 feet of water about 225 miles south of New Orleans  The Big Foot project may produce up to 75 000 barrels of oil and 25 million cubic feet of natural gas per day once it begins operations in 2014  40  41  Also in 2010  Chevron sanctioned the Jack St  Malo project  the company s first operated project located in the Lower Tertiary trend in the deepwater U S  Gulf of Mexico  The Jack and St  Malo fields are located within 25 miles of each other in the Gulf of Mexico  about 280 miles southwest of New Orleans in water depths of 7 000 feet  The initial development of the project will require an investment of approximately  7 5 billion  It will be comprised of three subsea centers tied back to a hub production facility with a capacity of 170 000 barrels of oil and 42 5 million cubic feet of natural gas per day  42  In 2009  Chevron announced an oil discovery at the Buckskin prospect in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico about 190 miles southeast of Houston  The well is located in approximately 6 920feet of water and was drilled to a depth of 29 404 feet  In 2011  the company announced an oil discovery at the Moccasin prospect in the deepwater U S  Gulf of Mexico  43  The well is located approximately 216 miles off the Louisiana coast in 6 759 feet of water and was drilled to a depth of 31 545 feet  In addition to its deepwater Gulf of Mexico activities  Chevron is one of the largest producers of oil and natural gas on the Gulf of Mexico shelf   edit  San Joaquin Valley The San Joaquin Valley comprises the southern two thirds of the Central Valley of California  Chevron and its predecessor companies have operated in San Joaquin Valley since the late 1800s  Chevron currently operates eight fields that include  Kern River  Coalinga  Cymric  and Midway Sunset  The Kern River Oil Field  just outside of Bakersfield  California  is now recognized as the fifth largest in the US  It has produced over 2 billion barrels of oil  qualifying it as a  supergiant  field  An estimated half a billion barrels of reserves remain  but with another generation of enhanced oil recovery  EOR  technology  Chevron believes it can extract considerably more  The Kern River field is also one of the longest lived in the nation  having been in production for over 100 years  44  In the Kern River Field  Chevron uses steam flooding  a process by which high temperature steam is injected into a reservoir  making the heavy oil less viscous and driving it to production wells  45  Heat induced swelling of the oil also aids in releasing it from the reservoir rock  46  In Kern River  Chevron has developed a work efficiency program called iField  iField is a 3 D map of the surface  with oil wells  structures  vehicles  and people  all updated in real time  The program amasses information from across the San Joaquin Valley fields and allows workers to optimize operations  data architectures  and make it easier to introduce new technologies  47  48  In October 2011  a 29 megawatt thermal solar to steam facility was launched in the Coalinga Field  Instead of burning natural gas to heat the crude  Chevron Technology Ventures designed a system that aims more than 7 600 mirrors to a receiver atop a solar tower that then converts the concentrated sunlight to produce the necessary steam for injection into the ground  The project covers more than 100 acres and is the largest of its kind in the world  49   edit  Permian Basin The Permian Basin  located in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico  is approximately 250 miles wide and 300 miles long  The Permian Basin has the second largest oil reserves in the United States  after Alaska  50  Through its legacy companies

months later  Chevron acquired drilling and development rights for another 228 000 acres in the Marcellus Shale from Chief Oil  amp  Gas LLC and Tug Hill  Inc  55  According to reports  the Marcellus shale region contains 410 3 trillion cubic feet  Tcf  of the 2 543 Tcf of technically recoverable shale gas in the United States  56  In Pennsylvania  Marcellus natural gas development generated  11 2 billion in economic value  contributed  1 1 billion in state and local tax revenues  and supported nearly 140 000 jobs  Improvements in two drilling techniques   hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have made shale gas more accessible and affordable to develop  57   edit  Australia Further information  Energy in Australia Chevron is the largest holder of natural gas resources in Australia and is leading the development of the Gorgon Gas Project  the largest single resource project in Australia  The  43 billion Gorgon Project was started in 2010 and is expected to be brought online in 2014  58  The Gorgon project includes the construction of a 15 million tonne per annum Liquefied Natural Gas plant on Barrow Island and a domestic gas plant with the capacity to provide 300 terajoules per day to supply gas to Western Australia  The Gorgon Project will be one of the most greenhouse gas efficient LNG developments in the world  due largely to its global scale CO2 injection project that will sequester naturally occurring CO2 in the gas from the Gorgon and Jansz reservoirs  59  In September 2011  Chevron announced that it would proceed with the Wheatstone liquefied natural gas development in West Australia  The foundation phase of the Wheatstone Project is estimated to cost  29 billion and consists of two LNG processing trains with a combined capacity of 8 9 million tons per annum  a domestic gas plant and associated offshore infrastructure  60  During peak construction  the Gorgon and Wheatstone Projects together  will create an estimated 16 500 direct

plans to potentially open a 200 MW geothermal facility in South Sumatra  In the Philippines  Chevron also operates geothermal wells at Tiwi field in Albay province  the Makiling Banahaw field in Laguna and Quezon provinces  87   edit  Electric Vehicles Chevron Technology Ventures once held the patent for a certain type of nickel metal hydride battery  NiMH   and also had at 50  stake   with Energy Conservation Devices  ECD  holding the other 50    in Cobasys  a company which produced Lithium Ion Batteries  In 2009  both Chevron and Energy Conservation Devices sold their stakes in Cobasys to SB LiMotive Co  Ltd and today  neither Chevron nor Energy Conservation Devices have any relationship with Cobasys  Chevron no longer holds the patent for NiMH technology  the rights to which are held between Energy Conservation Devices and SB LiMotive as a result of the Cobasys sale  Chevron was once rumored to be limiting access to large NiMH batteries through its control of patent licenses in order to remove a competitor to gasoline  This culminated in a lawsuit against Panasonic and Toyota over production of the EV 95 battery used in the RAV4 EV  88  89  However  with the Lithium ion battery  it appears there will be plenty of gas and electricity for all interested parties for the foreseeable future  Chevron once owned a minority share of Energy Conservation Devices  the leading producer of Lithium Ion Batteries  Chevron Texaco purchased a stake in an ECD subsidiary from GM in 2001  reportedly so Chevron Texaco could expand their business into the emerging hybrid market  But  some in the alternative energy field see an ulterior motive  so Chevron Texaco can suppress the development of Lithium Ion Batteries  They feel this way because ECD has shown little interest in selling Lithium Ion Batteries to electric vehicle enthusiasts since Chevron became a partial owner  Nevertheless  ECD does continue to work with commercial manufacturers  90  91  92   edit  Biofuels Chevron Technology Ventures  CTV  is investing between  300M and  400M USD a year into alternative fuel sources and environmentally sustainable technologies  CTV contains a biofuels business unit  93  In 2007  Chevron and US DOE s National Renewable Energy Laboratory  NREL  announced that they had entered into a collaborative agreement to produce biofuels from algae  Chevron and NREL scientists

1950 three companies  General Motors  Firestone and Chevron  then known as  Standard Oil   were charged and convicted of criminal conspiracy for their part in the General Motors streetcar conspiracy  The scandal involved purchasing streetcar systems throughout the United States and dismantling and replacing them with buses  101  in order to increase their sales of petroleum  automobiles and tires   edit  Tax evasion Chevron was found to have evaded  3 25 billion in federal and state taxes from 1970 to 2000 through a complex petroleum pricing scheme involving a project in Indonesia  102  103  Chevron and Texaco  before they merged in 2001  each owned 50 percent of a joint venture called Caltex  which pulled crude oil from the ground in a project with the Indonesian state oil company  Pertamina  Chevron was accused of reducing its tax liabilities in the U S  by buying oil from Caltex at inflated prices  One internal Chevron document set the price it paid Pertamina for oil at  4 55 a barrel higher than the prevailing market price  Chevron was then able to overstate deductions for costs on its U S  income tax returns  Indonesia appeared to levy tax on this oil at 56   a rate far higher than the corporate tax rate in the U S  Because the United States gives companies a credit for taxes paid to foreign governments  tax paid to the Indonesian government reduces tax to the U S  government  Caltex transferred fund out of the U S  to Indonesia  because the Indonesian government compensated Caltex for the excessively priced oil and the extra taxes paid by giving oil for free  Because Caltex had to pay taxes on that oil  too  the Indonesian government gave it even more oil to cover the taxes   edit  Blocking of NiMH battery technology for automobiles Main article  Patent encumbrance of large automotive NiMH batteries ECD Ovonics founder  Stan Ovshinksy  and Dr  Masahiko Oshitani of the Yuasa Company  invented the NiMH technology used in hybrid vehicles  104  105  In 1994  General Motors acquired a controlling interest in Ovonics s battery development and manufacturing business  On October 10  2001  the oil company Texaco purchased GM s share in GM Ovonics  and Chevron completed acquisition of Texaco six days later  In 2003  Texaco Ovonics Battery Systems was restructured into Cobasys  a 50 50 joint venture between Chevron and Energy Conversion Devices  ECD  Ovonics  106  Chevron s influence over Cobasys extends beyond a strict 50 50 joint venture  Chevron holds a 19 99  interest in ECD Ovonics  107  In addition  Chevron maintains the right to seize all of Cobasys  intellectual property rights if ECD Ovonics does not fulfill its contractual obligations  108  On September 10  2007  Chevron filed a legal claim that ECD Ovonics has not fulfilled its obligations  ECD Ovonics disputes this claim  109  Since that time  the arbitration hearing was repeatedly suspended while the parties negotiate with an unknown prospective buyer  No agreement has been reached with the potential buyer  110  Cobasys s patents relating to NiMH batteries expire in 2015  In her book  Plug in Hybrids  The Cars that Will Recharge America  published in February 2007  Sherry Boschert argues that large format NiMH batteries are commercially viable but that Cobasys refuses to sell the batteries or license the technology to small companies or individuals  Boschert argues that Cobasys accepts only very large orders for the batteries  Major automakers showed little interest in placing large orders for large format NiMH batteries  However  Toyota complained about the difficulty in getting smaller orders of large format NiMH batteries to service the existing 825 RAV 4EVs  Because no other companies were willing to place large orders  Cobasys was not manufacturing or licensing large format NiMH battery technology for automobiles  Boschert concludes that  it s possible that Cobasys  Chevron  is squelching all access to large NiMH batteries through its control of patent licenses in order to remove a competitor to gasoline  Or it s possible that Cobasys simply wants the market for itself and is waiting for a major automaker to start producing plug in hybrids or electric vehicles   111  In an interview with Economist  Ovshinsky subscribed to the former view   I think we at ECD we made a mistake of having a joint venture with an oil company  frankly speaking  And I think it s not a good idea to go into business with somebody whose strategies would put you out of business  rather than building the business   112  In December 2006  Cobasys and General Motors announced that they had signed a contract under which Cobasys provides NiMH batteries for the Saturn Aura hybrid sedan  113  In March 2007  GM announced that it would use Cobasys NiMH batteries in the 2008 Chevrolet Malibu hybrid as well  In October 2007  International Acquisitions Services and Innovative Transportation Systems filed suit against Cobasys and its parents for refusing to fill an order for large format NiMH batteries to be used in the electric Innovan  110  In August 2008  Mercedes Benz U S  International filed suit against Cobasys  on the ground Cobasys did not tender the batteries it agreed to build for Mercedes Benz s planned hybrid SUV  114   edit  Environmental damage in Ecuador The neutrality of this section is disputed  Please see the discussion on the talk page  Please do not remove this message until the dispute is resolved   March 2011  From 1972 to 1993  Texaco operated development of the Lago Agrio oil field in Ecuador  Ecuadorian farmers and indigenous residents accused Texaco  now Chevron   of making residents ill and damaging forests and rivers by discharging 18 billion US gallons  68 000 000 m3  of formation water into the rainforest  without any remediation  They sued Chevron for extensive environmental damage caused by these operations  which have sickened thousands of Ecuadorians and polluted the Amazon rainforest  The Ecuadorian court could have imposed a legal penalty of up to  28 billion in a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of Amazonian villagers in the region  Chevron claimed that agreements with the Ecuadorian Government exempted the company from any liabilities  115  116  117  A documentary on the issue  Crude  premiered in September 2009  From 1977 until 1992 Texaco  Texpet   a subsidiary of Texaco Inc   was a minority member of this consortium with Petroecuador  the Ecuadorian state owned oil company  as the majority partner  Since 1990  the operations have been conducted solely by Petroecuador  At the conclusion of the consortium and following an independent third party environmental audit of the area  Texaco formally agreed with the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador to conduct a three year remediation program at a cost of  40 million  The government subsequently granted Texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental liability arising from its operations  115  Based on the history above  Chevron believes that  this lawsuit lacks legal or factual merit   However  water and soil samples taken by an Ecuadorean scientific team after Texaco departed in 1998 found almost half still contained unsafe levels of petroleum hydrocarbons  118  On 15 February 2011  a court in Ecuador fined Chevron  8 6 billion over pollution to the country s Amazon region by Texaco between 1972 and 1992  with campaigners claiming loss of crops and farm animals as well as increased local cancer rates  118  119  120  The action was brought against Chevron by 30 000 Ecuadorean people  and is the first time that indigenous people have successfully sued a multinational corporation in the country where the pollution took place  118  119  The trial had begun in 2003  121  The total penalty imposed on Chevron is  9 5 billion as it was ruled that the oil company must pay an additional 10 per cent legally mandated reparations fee  119   27 billion was the sum total requested by plaintiffs   18 4 billion more than was eventually granted by the court  120  The Ecuadoreans expressed happiness that Chevron was declared guilty  though also expressed dismay that the award of  8 6 billion would not be enough to make up for the damage caused by the oil company  122  However  environmental activists wish this case to serve as a precedent against pollution causing business being carried out by firms in developing countries  119  Nonprofit organization Amazon Watch described the outcome of the case as  unprecedented   122  Chevron described the lawsuit as an  extortion scheme  and refused to pay the fine  118  Chevron has no international obligation to pay  and no assets in Ecuador for the government to seize   edit  Pollution in Richmond  California Chevron s activities at its century old Richmond refinery have been the subject of ongoing controversy  The project generated over 11 million pounds of toxic materials and caused more than 304 accidents  123  The Richmond refinery paid  540 000 in 1998 for illegally bypassing waste water treatments and failing to notify the public about toxic releases  124  Overall  Chevron is listed as potentially liable for 95 Superfund sites  with funds set aside by the EPA for clean up  125  In October 2003  the state of New Hampshire sued Chevron and other oil companies for using MTBE  a gasoline additive that the attorney general claimed polluted much of the state s water supply  126  The pollution created by the refinery has also had adverse health effects on the residents of Richmond  including relatively high rates of respiratory diseases and cancer when compared to the state and national averages  and the health issues related to emergency spills  127   edit  Property tax lawsuit In 2011 Chevron sued Contra Costa County for 60 million dollars claiming it s property taxes were too high  128  The company s lawyers stated that the refinery was not worth  3 billion dollars in 2007 and 2009 as assessed  128  Instead the legal team claimed it was only worth 1 8 and 1 15 billion dollars respectively  128  The company expressed no concern whatsoever that such a high amount of money would cripple the county s social services  128  The hearings were protested by Richmond mayor Gayle McGlaughlin  and councilmember Jovanka Beckels  the Richmond Progressive Alliance and activist Henry Clark or the West County Toxics Coalition  128  The county s attorney stated that Chevron s claims were  fraught with materials that don t satisfy evidentiary standards   128   edit  Oil spills in Angola Chevron s operations in Africa have also been criticized as environmentally unsound  129  In 2002  Angola became the first country in Africa ever to levy a fine on a major multinational corporation operating within its borders  when it demanded  2 million in compensation for oil spills allegedly caused by Chevron  130   edit  Violation of the Clean Air Act in the USA On October 16  2003  Chevron U S A  settled a charge under the Clean Air Act  which reduced harmful air emissions by about 10 000 tons a year  131  In San Francisco  Chevron was filed by a consent decree to spend almost  275 million to install and utilize innovative technology to reduce nitrogen and sulfur dioxide emissions at its refineries  132  After violating the Clean Air Act at an offline loading terminal in El Segundo  California  Chevron paid a  6 million penalty as well as  1 million for environmental improvement projects  133  Chevron also had implemented programs that minimized production of hazardous gases  upgraded leak detection and repair procedure  reduced emissions from sulfur recovery plants  and adopted strategies to ensure the proper handling of harmful benzene wastes at refineries  131  Chevron also spent about  500 000 to install leakless valves and double sealed pumps at its El Segundo refinery  which could prevent significant emissions of air contaminants  133  Defenders of Chevron s environmental record point to recent changes in the corporation  particularly its pledge in 2004 to combat global warming  134   edit  Sponsoring State Terrorism in Cabinda Cabinda Oil Fields constitute one of the largest Oil Drilling operations of Chevron  its actions and horrors against the Native Cabinda people are innumerable  among others Cabindans working for a meager salary receive 50  less than any other employees  In Cabinda crimes against humanity are possible due to Chevron sponsored Terror regimes  135  Chevron ongoing Oil Spill in Cabinda  136   edit  Niger Delta shootings On May 25  1998  over 100 activists staged a demonstration and occupied a barge servicing a company oil platform in the Niger Delta  Nigeria  137  After demanding a meeting with the managing director of the company to express their grievances  they were eventually met by a Nigerian employee whose job was to liaise with the local communities  After speaking to the elders of the community on shore  the representative then informed the activists that Chevron would offer more jobs to local people on the project but as to their other demands he would have to get back to them in a few days  137  Four days later  on May 28  1998  activists saw Chevron helicopters flying in and  in the words of one activist   We were looking at all these helicopters thinking that probably people inside these helicopters might have been Chevron reps who are actually coming to dialogue with us here   In fact  the helicopters contained members of the Nigerian navy and police  who immediately began teargassing and shooting at the activists and subsequently two activists  Jola Ogungbeje and Aroleka Irowaninu  died from their wounds  137  Chevron describes the situation as  a violent occupation of private property by aggressors seeking to extort cash payments from the company   138  The Nigerian government is reportedly 80  dependent upon oil production and is condemned by many for its reported treatment of environmentalists  139  The documentary  Drilling and Killing  covers these and other topics  U S  District Judge Susan Illston  in allowing a lawsuit brought by victims and their families against Chevron to proceed  said that there was evidence that Chevron had hired and provided transportation to Nigerian military forces known for their  general history of committing abuses   140  In March 2008  the plaintiffs  lawyers  without explanation   quietly moved to withdraw half of their claims  against Chevron  141  On December 1  2008  a federal jury cleared Chevron of all charges brought against them in the case  The jury deliberated for almost two days  Chevron had claimed that the military intervention was necessary to protect the lives of its workers and considers the jury s decision vindication for the accusations of wrongdoing  142   edit  Destruction of natural forest in Bangladesh On 26 June 2008  a fire in Lawachhara  a natural forest  known to be highly rare of its kind in the region  had broken out as Chevron Corp  carried out a 3D seismic survey that was to be six months long  The company had violated the conditions of government s environment clearance certificate by not informing the ministry about the cracks that had previously occurred in nearby residents  properties due to explosions caused by the activities  143   edit  Investment in Iran One of the U S  Embassy cables published by WikiLeaks  concerns a conversation which took place on March 19  2009  between the Iraqi Prime Minister  Nouri al Maliki  and the U S  charg  d affaires  144  One of the subjects discussed was the negotiation between the Iraqi Prime Minister and Chevron concerning a cross border oilfield  Iran Iraq   despite strict U S  sanctions which state  US persons may not perform services  including financing services  or supply goods or technology that would benefit the Iranian oil industry   Chevron asserted that they had not engaged in any negotiations that would violate U S  law  145  This document was intended to have been kept secret until 2029  144   edit  Oil

southeastern coast of Brazil  146  The Brazilian regulators said 416 400 liters oil leaked in two weeks from undersea rock near the well in the Frade oil project 370 km off the Brazilian coast  147  Prosecutors in Brazil are demanding  10 6bn in the legal suit  The National Petroleum Agency  ANP  suspended Chevron s activities in Brazil until it has established the cause of an oil spill off the coast of Rio de Janeiro  148   edit  KS Endeavor explosion The KS Endeavor jackup rig exploded on 16 January 2012 whilst drilling an exploration well for Chevron on the Funiwa field in Nigeria  Two of the 154 workers on the KS Endeavor and a nearby support barge are unaccounted for  The rig was contracted by Fode Drilling  The rig had been under contract to Chevron in Nigeria from January 2011 to
