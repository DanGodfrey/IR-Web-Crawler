genre or mode of literature that combines elements of both horror and romance  Gothicism s origin is attributed to English author Horace Walpole  with his 1764 novel The Castle of Otranto  subtitled  A Gothic Story   The effect of Gothic fiction feeds on a pleasing sort of terror  an extension of Romantic literary pleasures that were relatively new at the time of Walpole s novel  Melodrama and parody  including self parody  were other long standing features of the Gothic initiated by Walpole  Contents 1 Early Gothic romances 1 1 The Castle of Otranto 1 2 Clara Reeve 1 3 Ann Radcliffe 2

10 External links  edit  Early Gothic romances The Castle of Otranto  1764  is usually regarded as the first Gothic novel   edit  The Castle of Otranto Horace Walpole s The Castle of Otranto  1764  is often regarded as the first true Gothic romance  Walpole was obsessed with medieval Gothic architecture  and built his own house  Strawberry Hill  in that form  sparking a fashion for Gothic revival  1  His declared aim was to combine elements of the medieval romance  which he deemed too fanciful  and the modern novel  which he considered to be too confined to strict realism  2  The basic plot created many other Gothic staples  including a threatening mystery and an ancestral curse  as well as countless trappings such as hidden passages and oft fainting heroines  The first edition was published disguised as an actual medieval romance from Italy discovered and republished by a fictitious translator  When Walpole admitted to his authorship in the second edition  its originally favourable reception by literary reviewers changed into rejection  The romance  usually held in contempt by the educated as a tawdry and debased kind of writing  had only recently been made respectable by the works of Richardson and Fielding  3  A romance with superstitious elements  and moreover void of didactical intention  was considered a setback and not acceptable as a modern production  Walpole s forgery  together with the blend of history and fiction that was contravening the principles of the Enlightenment  brought about the Gothic novel s association with fake documentation   edit  Clara Reeve Clara Reeve  best known for her work The Old English Baron  1778   set out to take Walpole s plot and adapt it to the demands of the time by balancing fantastic elements with 18th century realism  The question now arose whether supernatural events that were not as evidently absurd as Walpole s would not lead the simpler minds to believe them possible   edit  Ann Radcliffe Ann Radcliffe developed the technique of the explained supernatural citation needed   in which every seemingly supernatural intrusion is eventually traced back to natural causes  Radcliffe made the Gothic novel socially acceptable  Her success attracted many imitators  mostly of low quality  which soon led to a general perception of the genre as inferior  formulaic  and stereotypical  Among other elements  Ann Radcliffe also introduced the brooding figure of the Gothic villain  which developed into the Byronic hero  Radcliffe s novels  above all The Mysteries of Udolpho  1794   were best sellers  although along with all novels they were looked down upon by well educated people as sensationalist women s entertainment  despite some men s enjoyment of them  Radcliffe also provided an aesthetic for the genre in an influential article  On the Supernatural in Poetry   4  examining the distinction and correlation between horror and terror in Gothic fiction  5   edit  Developments in continental Europe  and The Monk Contemporaneously to English Gothic  parallel Romantic literary movements developed in continental Europe  the roman noir   black novel   in France  by such writers as Fran ois Guillaume Ducray Duminil  Gaston Leroux  Baculard d Arnaud  and St phanie F licit  Ducrest de St Albin  Madame de Genlis and the Schauerroman   shudder novel   in Germany by such writers as Friedrich Schiller  author of The Ghost Seer  1789  and Christian Heinrich Spiess  author of Das Peterm nnchen  1791 92   These works were often more horrific and violent than the English Gothic novel  The fruit of this harvest of continental horrors was Matthew Gregory Lewis s lurid tale of monastic debauchery  black magic  and diabolism The Monk  1796   Though Lewis s novel could be read as a pastiche of the emerging genre  self parody was a constituent part of the Gothic from the time of the genre s inception with Walpole s Otranto  Lewis s tale appalled some contemporary readers  however his portrayal of depraved monks  sadistic inquisitors and spectral nuns  and his scurrilous view of the Catholic Church was an important development in the genre and influenced established terror writer Anne Radcliffe in her last novel The Italian  1797   In this book the hapless protagonists are ensnared in a web of deceit by a malignant monk called Schedoni and eventually dragged before the tribunals of the Inquisition in Rome  leading one contemporary to remark that if Radcliffe wished to transcend the horror of these scenes she would have to visit hell itself  6  The Marquis de Sade used a Gothic framework for some of his fiction  notably The Misfortunes of Virtue and Eugenie de Franval  though the marquis himself never thought of his work as such  Sade critiqued the genre in the preface of his Reflections on the novel  1800  which is widely accepted today  stating that the Gothic is  the inevitable product of the revolutionary shock with which the whole of Europe resounded   This correlation between the French revolutionary Terror and the  terrorist school  of writing represented by Radcliffe and Lewis was noted by contemporary critics of the genre  7  Sade considered The Monk to be superior to the work of Ann Radcliffe  Other notable writers in the continental tradition include Jan Potocki  1761 1815  and E  T  A  Hoffmann  1776 1822    edit  The Romantics Mary Shelley s Frankenstein  or  the Modern Prometheus  1818  has come to define Gothic fiction in the Romantic period  Frontispiece to 1831 edition shown  Further contributions to the Gothic genre were provided in the work of the Romantic poets  Prominent examples include Coleridge s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Christabel and Keats  La Belle Dame sans Merci  1819  and Isabella  or the Pot of Basil  1820  which feature mysteriously fey ladies  Skarda and Jaffe 1981  33 5  132 3   In the latter poem the names of the characters  the dream visions and the macabre physical details are influenced by the novels of premiere Gothicist Anne Radcliffe  Skarda and Jaffe 1981  132 3   Percy Bysshe Shelley s first published work was the Gothic novel Zastrozzi  1810   about an outlaw obsessed with revenge against his father and half brother  Shelley published a second Gothic novel in 1811  St  Irvyne  or  The Rosicrucian  about an alchemist who seeks to impart the secret of immortality  The poetry  romantic adventures and character of Lord Byron  characterised by his spurned lover Lady Caroline Lamb as  mad  bad and dangerous to know  were another inspiration for the Gothic  providing the archetype of the Byronic hero  Byron features  under the codename of  Lord Ruthven   in Lady Caroline s own Gothic novel  Glenarvon  1816   Byron was also the host of the celebrated ghost story competition involving himself  Percy Bysshe Shelley  Mary Shelley  and John William Polidori at the Villa Diodati on the banks of Lake Geneva in the summer of 1816  This occasion was productive of both Mary Shelley s Frankenstein  1818  and Polidori s The Vampyre  1819   This latter story revives Lamb s Byronic  Lord Ruthven   but this time as a vampire  The Vampyre has been accounted by cultural critic Christopher Frayling as one of the most influential works of fiction ever written and spawned a craze for vampire fiction and theatre  and latterly film  which has not ceased to this day  Mary Shelley s novel  though clearly influenced by the Gothic tradition  is often considered the first science fiction novel  despite the omission in the novel of any scientific explanation of the monster s animation and the focus instead on the moral issues and consequences of such a creation  A late example of traditional Gothic is Melmoth the Wanderer  1820  by Charles Maturin which combines themes of Anti Catholicism with an outcast Byronic hero  Varma 1986    edit  Victorian Gothic Edgar Allan Poe was an important reinterpreter of Gothic fiction  By the Victorian era Gothic had ceased to be the dominant genre and was dismissed by most critics  in fact the form s popularity as an established genre had already begun to erode with the success of the historical romance popularised by Sir Walter Scott   However  in many ways  it was now entering its most creative phase  Recently readers and critics have begun to reconsider a number of previously overlooked Penny Blood or Penny Dreadful serial fictions by such authors as G W M  Reynolds who wrote a trilogy of Gothic horror novels  Faust  1846   Wagner the Wehr wolf  1847  and The Necromancer  1857   8  Reynolds was also responsible for The Mysteries of London which has been accorded an important place in the development of the urban as a particularly Victorian Gothic setting  an area within which interesting links can be made with established readings of the work of Dickens and others  Another famous penny dreadful of this era was the anonymously authored Varney the Vampire  1847   The formal relationship between these fictions  serialised for predominantly working class audiences  and the roughly contemporaneous sensation fictions serialised in middle class periodicals is also an area worthy of inquiry  Influential critics  above all John Ruskin  far from denouncing mediaeval obscurantism  praised the imagination and fantasy exemplified by its Gothic architecture  influencing the Pre Raphaelites  An important and innovative reinterpreter of the Gothic in this period was Edgar Allan Poe  Poe focused less on the traditional elements of gothic stories and more on the psychology of his characters as they often descended into madness  Poe s critics complained about his  German  tales  to which he replied   that terror is not of Germany  but of the soul   Poe  a critic himself  believed that terror was a legitimate literary subject  His story  The Fall of the House of Usher   1839  explores these  terrors of the soul  whilst revisiting classic Gothic tropes of aristocratic decay  death  and madness  9  The legendary villainy of the Spanish Inquisition  previously explored by Gothicists Radcliffe  Lewis  and Maturin  is revisited in  The Pit and the Pendulum   1842   The influence of Ann Radcliffe is also detectable in Poe s  The Oval Portrait   1842   including an honorary mention of her name in the text of the story  The influence of Byronic Romanticism evident in Poe is also apparent in the work of the Bront  sisters  Emily Bront  s Wuthering Heights  1847  transports the Gothic to the forbidding Yorkshire Moors and features ghostly apparitions and a Byronic hero in the person of the demonic Heathcliff whilst Charlotte Bront  s Jane Eyre  1847  adds The Madwoman in the Attic  Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar 1979  to the cast of Gothic fiction  The Bront s  fiction is seen by some feminist critics as prime examples of Female Gothic  exploring woman s entrapment within domestic space and subjection to patriarchal authority and the transgressive and dangerous attempts to subvert and escape such restriction  Charlotte s Jane Eyre and Emily s Cathy are both examples of female protagonists in such a role  10 Louisa May Alcott s Gothic potboiler  A Long Fatal Love Chase  written in 1866  but published in 1995  is also an interesting specimen of this subgenre  Elizabeth Gaskell s tales  The Doom of the Griffiths   1858   Lois the Witch   and  The Grey Woman  all employ one of the most common themes of Gothic fiction  the power of ancestral sins to curse future generations  or the fear that they will  The gloomy villain  forbidding mansion  and persecuted heroine of Sheridan Le Fanu s Uncle Silas  1864  shows the direct influence of both Walpole s Otranto and Radcliffe s Udolpho  Le Fanu s short story collection In a Glass Darkly  1872  includes the superlative vampire tale Carmilla  which provided fresh blood for that particular strand of the Gothic and influenced Bram Stoker s Dracula  1897   According to literary critic Terry Eagleton  Le Fanu  together with his predecessor Maturin and his successor Stoker  form a sub genre of Irish Gothic  whose stories  featuring castles set in a barren landscape  with a cast of remote aristocrats dominating an atavistic peasantry  represent in allegorical form the political plight of colonial Ireland subjected to the Protestant Ascendancy  11  The genre was also a heavy influence on more mainstream writers  such as Charles Dickens  who read Gothic novels as a teenager and incorporated their gloomy atmosphere and melodrama into his own works  shifting them to a more modern period and an urban setting  including Oliver Twist  1837 8   Bleak House  1854   Mighall 2003  and Great Expectations  1860 61   These pointed to the juxtaposition of wealthy  ordered and affluent civilisation next to the disorder and barbarity of the poor within the same metropolis  Bleak House in particular is credited with seeing the introduction of urban fog to the novel  which would become a frequent characteristic of urban Gothic literature and film  Mighall 2007   His most explicitly Gothic work is his last novel The Mystery of Edwin Drood  1870   The mood and themes of the Gothic novel held a particular fascination for the Victorians  with their morbid obsession with mourning rituals  mementos  and mortality in general  Robert Louis Stevenson s Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde  1886  was a classic Gothic work of the 1880s  seeing many stage adaptations  The 1880s saw the revival of the Gothic as a powerful literary form allied to fin de siecle  which fictionalized contemporary fears like ethical degeneration and questioned the social structures of the time  Classic works of this Urban Gothic include Robert Louis Stevenson s Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde  1886   Oscar Wilde s The Picture of Dorian Gray  1891   George du Maurier s Trilby  1894   Richard Marsh s The Beetle  A Mystery  1897   Henry James  The Turn of the Screw  1898   and the stories of Arthur Machen  The most famous Gothic villain ever  Count Dracula was created by Bram Stoker in his novel Dracula  1897   Stoker s book also established Transylvania and Eastern Europe as the locus classicus of the Gothic  12  In America  two notable writers of the end of the 19th century  in the Gothic tradition  were Ambrose Bierce and Robert W  Chambers  Bierce s short stories were in the horrific and pessimistic tradition of Poe  Chambers  though  indulged in the decadent style of Wilde and Machen  even to the extent of having a character named  Wilde  in his The King in Yellow    edit  Parody The excesses  stereotypes  and frequent absurdities of the traditional Gothic made it rich territory for satire  13  The most famous parody of the Gothic is Jane Austen s novel Northanger Abbey  1818  in which the naive protagonist  after reading too much Gothic fiction  conceives herself a heroine of a Radcliffian romance and imagines murder and villainy on every side  though the truth turns out to be much more prosaic  Jane Austen s novel is valuable for including a list of early Gothic works since known as the Northanger Horrid Novels  These books  with their lurid titles  were once thought to be the creations of Jane Austen s imagination  though later research by Michael Sadleir and Montague Summers confirmed that they did actually exist and stimulated renewed interest in the Gothic  They are currently all being reprinted by Valancourt Press  14  Another example of Gothic parody in a similar vein is The Heroine by Eaton Stannard Barrett  1813   Cherry Wilkinson  a fatuous female protagonist with a history of novel reading  fancies herself as the heroine of a Gothic romance  She perceives and models reality according to the stereotypes and typical plot structures of the Gothic novel  leading to a series of absurd events culminating in catastrophe  After her downfall  her affectations and excessive imaginations become eventually subdued by the voice of reason in the form of Stuart  a paternal figure  under whose guidance the protagonist receives a sound education and correction of her misguided taste  15   edit  Post Victorian legacy  edit  Pulp Pulp magazines such as Weird Tales reprinted and popularized Gothic horror from the prior century  Notable English twentieth century writers in the Gothic tradition include Algernon Blackwood  William Hope Hodgson  M  R  James  Hugh Walpole  and Marjorie Bowen  In America pulp magazines such as Weird Tales reprinted classic Gothic horror tales from the previous century  by such authors as Poe  Arthur Conan Doyle  and Edward Bulwer Lytton and printed new stories by modern authors featuring both traditional and new horrors  16  The most significant of these was H  P  Lovecraft who also wrote an excellent conspectus of the Gothic and supernatural horror tradition in his Supernatural Horror in Literature  1936  as well as developing a Mythos that would influence Gothic and contemporary horror well into the 21st century  Lovecraft s prot g   Robert Bloch  contributed to Weird Tales and penned Psycho  1959   which drew on the classic interests of the genre  From these  the Gothic genre per se gave way to modern horror fiction  regarded by some literary critics as a branch of the Gothic  17  although others use the term to cover the entire genre   edit  New Gothic Romances Gothic Romances of this description became popular during the 1950s  1960s  and 1970s  with authors such as Phyllis A  Whitney  Joan Aiken  Dorothy Eden  Victoria Holt  Barbara Michaels  Mary Stewart  and Jill Tattersall  Many featured covers depicting a terror stricken woman in diaphanous attire in front of a gloomy castle  often with a single lit window  Many were published under the Paperback Library Gothic imprint and were marketed to a female audience  Though the authors were mostly women  some men wrote Gothic romances under female pseudonyms  For instance the prolific Clarissa Ross and Marilyn Ross were pseudonyms for the male writer Dan Ross and Frank Belknap Long published Gothics under his wife s name  Lyda Belknap Long  Another example is British writer Peter O Donnell  who wrote under the pseudonym Madeleine Brent  Outside of companies like Lovespell  who carry Colleen Shannon  very few books seem to be published using the term today  citation needed   edit  Southern Gothic William Faulkner who wrote novels and short stories in the Southern Gothic genre  The genre also influenced American writing to create the Southern Gothic genre  which combines some Gothic sensibilities  such as the Grotesque  with the setting and style of the Southern United States   Examples include William Faulkner  Eudora Welty  Harper Lee  and Flannery O Connor  18  Contemporary American writers in this tradition include Joyce Carol Oates  in such novels as Bellefleur and A Bloodsmoor Romance and short story collections such as Night Side  Skarda 1986b  and Raymond Kennedy in his novel Lulu Incognito  The Southern Ontario Gothic applies a similar sensibility to a Canadian cultural context  Robertson Davies  Alice Munro  Barbara Gowdy  and Margaret Atwood have all produced works that are notable exemplars of this form  Another writer in this tradition was Henry Farrell whose best known work was the Hollywood horror novel What Ever Happened to Baby Jane   1960   Farrel s novels spawned a sub genre of  Grande Dame Guignol  in the cinema  dubbed the  Psycho biddy  genre   edit  Modern horror Many modern writers of horror  or indeed other types of fiction  exhibit considerable Gothic sensibilities examples include the works of Anne Rice  as well as some of the sensationalist works of Stephen King  19  20  The Romantic strand of Gothic was taken up in Daphne du Maurier s Rebecca  1938  which is in many respects a reworking of Charlotte Bront  s Jane Eyre  Other books by du Maurier  such as Jamaica Inn  1936   also display Gothic tendencies  Du Maurier s work inspired a substantial body of  Female Gothics   concerning heroines alternately swooning over or being terrified by scowling Byronic men in possession of acres of prime real estate and the appertaining droit de seigneur   edit  Other media The themes of the literary Gothic have been translated into other media  The early 1970s saw a Gothic Romance comic book mini trend with such titles as DC Comics  The Dark Mansion Of Forbidden Love and The Sinister House of Secret Love  Charlton Comics  Haunted Love  Curtis Magazines  Gothic Tales of Love  and Atlas Seaboard Comics  one shot magazine Gothic Romances  There was a notable revival in twentieth century Gothic horror films such the classic Universal Horror films of the 1930s  Hammer Horror  and Roger Corman s Poe cycle  21  In Hindi cinema  the Gothic tradition was combined with aspects of Indian culture  particularly reincarnation  to give rise to an  Indian Gothic  genre  beginning with the films Mahal  1949  and Madhumati  1958   22  Twentieth century rock music also had its Gothic side  Black Sabbath s 1970 debut album created a dark sound different from other bands at the time and has been called the first ever  Goth rock  record  23  Themes from Gothic writers such as H  P  Lovecraft were also used among gothic rock and heavy metal bands  especially in black metal  thrash metal  Metallica s The Call of Ktulu   death metal  and gothic metal  For example  heavy metal musician King Diamond delights in telling stories full of horror  theatricality  satanism and anti Catholicism in his compositions  24   edit  Elements of Gothic fiction  edit  Archetypes in the Gothic Novel As David De Vore states   The Gothic hero becomes a sort of archetype as we find that there is a pattern to their characterization  There is always the protagonist  usually isolated either voluntarily or involuntarily  Then there is the villain  who is the epitome of evil  either by his  usually a man  own fall from grace  or by some implicit malevolence  The Wanderer  found in many Gothic tales  is the epitome of isolation as he wanders the earth in perpetual exile  usually a form of divine punishment   25  Below are classified different stock characters of the Gothic Novel along with examples from popular fiction in the genre  Virginal Maiden   young  beautiful  pure  innocent  kind  virtuous  Shows these virtues by fainting and crying whenever her delicate sensibilities are challenged  usually starts out with a mysterious past and it is later revealed that she is the daughter of an aristocratic or noble family  Matilda in The Castle of Otranto   She is determined to give up Theodore  the love of her life  for her cousin s sake  Matilda always puts others first before herself  and always believes the best in others  Adeline in The Romance of the Forest    Her wicked Marquis  having secretly immured Number One  his first wife   has now a new and beautiful wife  whose character  alas  Does not bear inspection   26  As this review states  the virginal maiden character is above inspection because her personality is flawless  Hers is a virtuous character whose piety and unflinching optimism causes all to fall in love with her  Older  Foolish Woman Hippolita in The Castle of Otranto   Hippolita is depicted as the obedient wife of her tyrant husband who  would not only acquiesce with patience to divorce  but would obey  if it was his pleasure  in endeavouring to persuade Isabelle to give him her hand   27  This shows how weak women are portrayed as they are completely submissive  and in Hippolita s case  even support polygamy at the expense of her own marriage  28  Madame LaMotte in The Romance of the Forest   naively assumes that her husband is having an affair with Adeline  Instead of addressing the situation directly  she foolishly lets her ignorance turn into pettiness and mistreatment of Adeline  Hero Theodore in The Castle of Otranto   he is witty  and successfully challenges the tyrant  saves the virginal maid without expectations Theodore in The Romance of the Forest   saves Adeline multiple times  is virtuous  courageous and brave  self sacrificial Tyrant Manfred in The Castle of Otranto   unjustly accuses Theodore of murdering Conrad  Tries to put his blame onto others  Lies about his motives for attempting to divorce his wife and marry his late son s fianc   The Marquis in The Romance of the Forest   attempts to get with Adeline even though he is already married  attempts to rape Adeline  blackmails Monsieur LaMotte  Vathek   Ninth Caliph of the Abassides  who ascended to the throne at an early age  His figure was pleasing and majestic  but when angry  his eyes became so terrible that  the wretch on whom it was fixed instantly fell backwards and sometimes expired   He was addicted to women and pleasures of the flesh  so he ordered five palaces to be built  the five palaces of the senses  Although he was an eccentric man  learned in the ways of science  physics  and astrology  he loved his people  His main greed  however  was thirst for knowledge  He wanted to know everything  This is what led him on the road to damnation   29  The Stupid Servant   acts as comic relief by asking seemingly stupid questions  transitions between scenes  brings news  messenger  moves plot forward Peter in The Romance of the Forest   whenever he brings information to people  he never gets to the point but prattles on and on about insignificant things   The reader eagerly follows the flight of LaMotte  also of Peter  his coachman  an attached  comic  and familiar domestic   30  Bianca in The Castle of Otranto   a gossip  helps characters get valuable news  provides comic relief Clowns   break the tension and act as comic relief Diego and Jaquez in The Castle of Otranto   they appear to talk about random things  and argue foolishly with each other in order to lighten the air of the novel  Banditti   Ruffians They appear in several Gothic Novels including The Romance of the Forest in which they kidnap Adeline from her father  Clergy   always weak  usually evil Father Jerome in The Castle of Otranto   Jerome  though not evil  is certainly weak as he gives up his son when he is born and leaves his lover  Ambrosio in The Monk   Evil and weak  this character stoops to the lowest levels of corruption including rape and incest  Mother Superior in The Romance of the Forest   Adeline fled from this convent because the sisters weren t allowed to see sunlight  Highly oppressive environment  The Setting The setting of the Gothic Novel is a character in itself  The plot is usually set in a castle  an abbey  a monastery  or some other  usually religious edifice  and it is acknowledged that this building has secrets of its own  It is this gloomy and frightening scenery  which sets the scene for what the audience should expect  The importance of setting is noted in a London review of the Castle of Otranto   He describes the country towards Otranto as desolate and bare  extensive downs covered with thyme  with occasionally the dwarf holly  the rosa marina  and lavender  stretch around like wild moorlands Mr  Williams describes the celebrated Castle of Otranto as  an imposing object of considerable size has a dignified and chivalric air  A fitter scene for his romance he probably could not have chosen   Similarly  De Vore states   The setting is greatly influential in Gothic novels  It not only evokes the atmosphere of horror and dread  but also portrays the deterioration of its world  The decaying  ruined scenery implies that at one time there was a thriving world  At one time the abbey  castle  or landscape was something treasured and appreciated  Now  all that lasts is the decaying shell of a once thriving dwelling   25  Thus  without the decrepit backdrop to initiate the events  the Gothic Novel would not exist   edit  Role of Architecture and setting in the Gothic Novel Strawberry Hill  an English villa in the  Gothic revival  style  built by Gothic writer Horace Walpole Gothic literature is intimately associated with the Gothic Revival architecture of the same era  In a way similar to the Gothic revivalists  rejection of the clarity and rationalism of the neoclassical style of the Enlightened Establishment  the literary Gothic embodies an appreciation of the joys of extreme emotion  the thrills of fearfulness and awe inherent in the sublime  and a quest for atmosphere  The ruins of Gothic buildings gave rise to multiple linked emotions by representing the inevitable decay and collapse of human creations   thus the urge to add fake ruins as eyecatchers in English landscape parks  English Gothic writers often associated medieval buildings with what they saw as a dark and terrifying period  characterized by harsh laws enforced by torture  and with mysterious  fantastic  and superstitious rituals  In literature such Anti Catholicism had a European dimension featuring Roman Catholic institutions such as the Inquisition  in southern European countries such as Italy and Spain   Just as elements of Gothic architecture were borrowed during the Gothic Revival period in architecture  ideas about the Gothic period and Gothic period architecture were often used by Gothic novelists  Architecture itself played a role in the naming of Gothic novels  with many titles referring to castles or other common Gothic buildings  This naming was followed up with many Gothic novels often set in Gothic buildings  with the action taking place in castles  abbeys  convents and monasteries  many of them in ruins  evoking  feelings of fear  surprise  confinement   This setting of the novel  a castle or religious building  often one fallen into disrepair  was an essential element of the Gothic novel  Placing a story in a Gothic building served several purposes  It drew on feelings of awe  it implied the story was set in the past  it gave an impression of isolation or being cut off from the rest of the world and it drew on the religious associations of the Gothic style  This trend of using Gothic architecture began with the Castle of Otranto and was to become a major element of the genre from that point forward  Besides using Gothic architecture as a setting  with the aim of eliciting certain associations from the reader  there was an equally close association between the use of Gothic architecture and the storylines of Gothic novels  with the architecture often serving as a mirror for the characters and the plot lines of the story  31  The buildings in the Castle of Otranto  for example  are riddled with underground tunnels  which the characters use to move back and forth in secret  This secret movement mirrors one of the plots of the story  specifically the secrets surrounding Manfred s possession of the castle and how it came into his family  32  The setting of the novel in a Gothic castle was meant to imply not only a story set in the past but one shrouded in darkness  In The History of the Caliph Vathek  architecture was used to both illustrate certain elements of Vathek s character and also warn about the dangers of over reaching  Vathek s hedonism and devotion to the pursuit of pleasure are reflected in the pleasure wings he adds on to his castle  each with the express purpose of satisfying a different sense  He also builds a tall tower in order to further his quest for knowledge  This tower represents Vathek s pride and his desire for a power that is beyond the reach of humans  He is later warned that he must destroy the tower and return to Islam or else risk dire consequences  Vathek s pride wins out and  in the end  his quest for power and knowledge ends with him confined to Hell  33  In the Castle of Wolfenbach the castle that Matilda seeks refugee at while on the run is believed to haunted  Matilda discovers it is not ghosts but the Countess of Wolfenbach who lives on the upper floors and who has been forced into hiding by her husband  the Count  Matilda s discovery of the Countess and her subsequent informing others of the Countess s presence destroys the Count s secret  Shortly after Matilda meets the Countess the Castle of Wolfenbach itself is destroyed in a fire  mirroring the destruction of the Count s attempts to keep his wife a secret and how his plots throughout the story eventually lead to his own destruction  34  The major part of the action in the Romance of the Forest is set in an abandoned and ruined abbey and the building itself served as a moral lesson  as well as a major setting for and mirror of the action in the novel  The setting of the action in a ruined abbey  drawing on Burke s aesthetic theory of the sublime and the beautiful established the location as a place of terror and of safety  Burke argued the sublime was a source of awe or fear brought about by strong emotions such as terror or mental pain  On the other end of the spectrum was the beautiful  which were those things that brought pleasure and safety  Burke argued that the sublime was the more preferred to the two  Related to the concepts of the sublime and the beautiful is the idea of the picturesque  introduced by William Gilpin  which was thought to exist between the two other extremes  The picturesque was that which continued elements of both the sublime and the beautiful and can be thought of as a natural or uncultivated beauty  such as a beautiful ruin or a partially overgrown building  In Romance of the Forest Adeline and the La Mottes live in constant fear of discovery by either the police or Adeline s father and  at times  certain characters believe the castle to be haunted  On the other hand  the abbey also serves as a comfort  as it provides shelter and safety to the characters  Finally  it is picturesque  in that it was a ruin and serves as a combination of the both the natural and the human  By setting the story in the ruined abbey  Radcliffe was able to use architecture to draw on the aesthetic theories of the time and set the tone of the story in the minds of the reader  As with many of the buildings in Gothic novels  the abbey also has a series of tunnels  These tunnels serve as both a hiding place for the characters and as a place of secrets  This was mirrored later in the novel with Adeline hiding from the Marquis de Montalt and the secrets of the Marquis  which would eventually lead to his downfall and Adeline s salvation  35  Architecture served as an additional character in many Gothic novels  bringing with it associations to the past and to secrets and  in many cases  moving the action along and foretelling future events in the story   edit  The Female Gothic and the Supernatural Explained Characterized by its castles  dungeons  gloomy forests and hidden passages  from the Gothic novel genre emerged the Female Gothic  Guided by the works of authors such as Ann Radcliffe  Mary Shelley and Charlotte Bront   the Female Gothic permitted the introduction of feminine societal and sexual desires into Gothic texts  The Medieval society  in which Gothic texts are based  granted women writers the opportunity to attribute  features of the mode  of Gothicism  as the result of the suppression of female sexuality  or else as a challenge to the gender hierarchy and values of a male dominated culture   36  Significantly  with the development of the Female Gothic came the literary technique of explaining the supernatural  The Supernatural Explained   as this technique was aptly named   is a recurring plot device in Radcliffe s The Romance of the Forest  The novel  published in 1791  is among Radcliffe s earlier works  The novel sets up suspense for horrific events  which all have natural explanations  An eighteenth century response to the novel from the Monthly Review reads   We must hear no more of enchanted forests and castles  giants  dragons  walls of fire and other  monstrous and prodigious things     yet still forests and castles remain  and it is still within the province of fiction  without overstepping the limits of nature  to make use of them for the purpose of creating surprise   37  Radcliffe s use of Supernatural Explained is characteristic of the Gothic author  The female protagonists pursued in these texts are often caught in an unfamiliar and terrifying landscape  delivering higher degrees of horror  The end result  however  is the explained supernatural  rather than terrors familiar to women  such as rape  incest  ghosts or haunted castles  In Radcliffe s The Romance of the Forest  one may follow the female protagonist  Adeline  through the forest  hidden passages and abbey dungeons   without exclaiming   How these antique towers and vacant courts  chill the suspended soul  till expectation wears the cast of fear   37  The decision of Female Gothic writers to supplement true supernatural horrors with explained cause and effect transforms romantic plots and Gothic tales into common life and writing  Rather than establish the romantic plot in impossible events Radcliffe strays away from writing  merely fables  which no stretch of fancy could realize   38  English scholar Chloe Chard s published introduction to The Romance of the Forest refers to the  promised effect of terror   The outcome  however   may prove less horrific than the novel has originally suggested   Radcliffe sets up suspense throughout the course of the novel  insinuating a supernatural or superstitious cause to the mysterious and horrific occurrences of the plot  However  the suspense is relieved with the Supernatural Explained  For example  Adeline is reading the illegible manuscripts she found in her bedchamber s secret passage in the abbey when she hears a chilling noise from beyond her doorway  She goes to sleep unsettled  only to awake and learn that what she assumed to be haunting spirits were actually the domestic voices of the servant  Peter  La Motte  her caretaker in the abbey  recognizes the heights to which her imagination reached after reading the autobiographical manuscripts of a past murdered man in the abbey    I do not wonder  that after you had suffered its terrors to impress your imagination  you fancied you saw specters  and heard wondrous noises   La Motte said   God bless you  Ma amselle   said Peter   I m sorry I frightened you so last night    Frightened me   said Adeline   how was you concerned in that   He then informed her  that when he thought Monsieur and Madame La Motte were asleep  he had stolen to her chamber door    that he had called several times as loudly as he dared  but receiving no answer  he believed she was asleep    This account of the voice she had heard relieved Adeline s spirits  she was even surprised she did not know it  till remembering the perturbation of her mind for some time preceding  this surprise disappeared   39  While Adeline is alone in her characteristically Gothic chamber  she detects something supernatural  or mysterious about the setting  However  the  actual sounds that she hears are accounted for by the efforts of the faithful servant to communicate with her  there is still a hint of supernatural in her dream  inspired  it would be seem  by the fact that she is on the spot of her father s murder and that his unburied skeleton is concealed in the room next hers   40  The supernatural here is indefinitely explained  but what remains is the  tendency in the human mind to reach out beyond the tangible and the visible  and it is in depicting this mood of vague and half defined emotion that Mrs  Radcliffe excels   40  Transmuting the Gothic novel into a comprehendible tale for the imaginative Eighteenth Century woman was useful for the Female Gothic writers of the time  Novels were an experience for these women who had no outlet for a thrilling excursion  Sexual encounters and superstitious fantasies were idle elements of the imagination  However  the use of Female Gothic and Supernatural Explained  are a  good example of how the formula  Gothic novel  changes to suit the interests and needs of its current readers   In many respects  the novel s  current reader  of the time was the woman who  lay down her book with affected indifference  or momentary shame   41  according to Jane Austen  author of Northanger Abbey  The Gothic novel shaped its form for female readers to  turn to Gothic romances to find support for their own mixed feelings   42  Following the characteristic Gothic Bildungsroman like plot sequence  the Female Gothic allowed its readers to graduate from  adolescence to maturity   43  in the face of the realized impossibilities of the supernatural  As female protagonists in novels like Adeline in The Romance of the Forest learn that their superstitious fantasies and terrors are replaced with natural cause and reasonable doubt  the reader may understand the true position of the heroine in the novel   The heroine possesses the romantic temperament that perceives strangeness where others see none  Her sensibility  therefore  prevents her from knowing that her true plight is her condition  the disability of being female   43  Another text in which the heroine of the Gothic Novel encounters the Supernatural Explained is The Castle of Wolfenbach  1793  by Gothic author Eliza Parsons  This Female Gothic text by Parsons is listed as one of Catherine Morland s Gothic texts in Austen s Northanger Abbey  The heroine in The Castle of Wolfenbach  Matilda  seeks refuge after overhearing a conversation in which her Uncle Weimar speaks of plans to rape her  Matilda finds asylum in the Castle of Wolfenbach  a castle inhabited by old married caretakers who claim that the second floor is haunted  Matilda  being the courageous heroine  decides to explore the mysterious wing of the Castle  Bertha  wife of Joseph   caretakers of the castle  tells Matilda of the  other wing    Now for goodness sake  dear madam  don t go no farther  for as sure as you are alive  here the ghosts live  for Joseph says he often sees lights and hears strange things   44  However  as Matilda ventures through the castle  she finds that the wing is not haunted by ghosts and rattling chains  but rather  the Countess of Wolfenbach  The supernatural is explained  in this case  ten pages into the novel  and the natural cause of the superstitious noises is a Countess in distress  Characteristic of the Female Gothic  the natural cause of terror is not the supernatural  but rather female disability and societal horrors  rape  incest and the threatening control of the male antagonist   edit  Notes   Punter  2004  p177   Punter  2004  p178   Fuchs  2004  p106   The New Monthly
