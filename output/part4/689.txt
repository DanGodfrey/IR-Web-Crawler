The word Nagorno  is a Russian attributive adjective  derived from the adjective nagorny             which means  highland   The Azerbaijani name of the region includes similar adjectives  da l q   mountainous  or  yuxar    upper   Such words are not used in Armenian name  but appeared in the official name of the region during the Soviet era as Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast  Other languages apply their own wording for mountainous  upper  or highland  for example  the official name used by the Nagorno Karabakh Republic in France is Haut Karabakh  meaning  Upper Karabakh   The word Karabakh is generally held to originate from Turkic and Persian  and literally means  black garden   5  6  The name first appears in Georgian and Persian sources of the 13th and 14th centuries  6 Karabagh is an acceptable alternate spelling of Karabakh  and also denotes a kind of patterned rug originally produced in the area  7  In an alternative theory proposed by Bagrat Ulubabyan the name Karabakh has a Turkic Armenian origin  meaning  Greater Baghk   Armenian             a reference to Ktish Baghk  later  Dizak   one of the principalities of Artsakh under the rule of the Aranshahik dynasty  which held the throne of the Kingdom of Syunik in the 11th 13th centuries and called itself the  Kingdom of Baghk   8  The names for the region in the various local languages all translate to  mountainous Karabakh   or  mountainous black garden   Armenian                    transliterated Le nayin  araba   IPA   l rn  jin      b     Azerbaijani  Da l q Qaraba   mountainous Karabakh  IPA

Karabakh is often referred to by the Armenians living in the area as Artsakh  Armenian          designating the 10th province of the ancient Kingdom of Armenia  In Urartian inscriptions  9th 7th centuries BC   the name Urtekhini is used for the region  9 Ancient Greek sources called the area Orkhistene  10  History Antiquity and Early Middle Ages Main article  History of Nagorno Karabakh The Amaras Monastery  founded in the 4th century by St  Gregory the Illuminator  In the 5th century  Mesrob Mashtots  inventor of the Armenian alphabet  established at Amaras the first school to use his script  11  12  The monastery at Gandzasar was commissioned by the House of Khachen and completed in 1238 Constitution of Aghven                     written in Nagorno Karabakh in the 5th century laid out a blueprint of constitutional texts in medieval Armenia  13  14  15  Nagorno Karabakh falls within the lands occupied by peoples known to modern archaeologists as the Kura Araxes culture  who lived between the two rivers Kura and Araxes  The ancient population of the region consisted of various pre Armenian autochthonous local and migrant tribes who were mostly non Indo Europeans  as the rest of the Armenian Plateau   16  According to the prevailing western theory  these natives intermarried with the so called proto Armenians who came to the region after its inclusion into Armenia in the 2nd or  possibly earlier  in 4th century BC  17  Other scholars suggest that the proto Armenians settled in the region as early as in the 7th century BC  18  The ancient Greek historian Strabo testifies that by the 1st or 2nd century BC population on the entire territory of Armenia  including the area of modern Nagorno Karabakh  spoke Armenian   19  In around 180 BC the territory of modern Nagorno Karabakh formed the central part of Artsakh   one of the 15 provinces of the Armenian Kingdom  and remained so until the 4th century AD  20  While formally having the status of a province  nahang   Artsakh possibly formed a principality on its own  much like Armenia s neighboring province of Syunik  Other theories suggest that Artsakh was a royal land  belonging to the King of Armenia directly  21 Tigran the Great  King of Armenia   ruled from 95 55 BC   founded in Artsakh one of four cities named  Tigranakert  after himself  22  The ruins of the ancient Tigranakert  located 30 miles north east of Nagorno Karabakh Republic s capital of Stepanakert  are being studied by a group of international scholars  The ruins of the second Tigranakert have yet to be uncovered  although it is believed to have been located in the district of Gardman  In 387 AD  after the partition of Armenia between Byzantium and Persia  two Armenian provinces Artsakh and Utik passed to Caucasian Albania  which  in turn  came under strong Armenian religious and cultural influence  23  24  At the time the population of Artsakh and Utik consisted of Armenians and several Armenized tribes  16  The Armenian medieval atlas Ashkharatsuits                compiled in the 7th century by Anania Shirakatsi                   but sometimes attributed to Movses Khorenatsi as well   categorizes Artsakh and Utik as provinces of Armenia despite their presumed detachment from the Armenian Kingdom and their political association with Caucasian Albania and Persia at the time of his writing  25 Shirakatsi specifies that Artsakh and Utik are  now detached  from Armenia and included in  Aghvank   and he takes care to distinguish this new entity from the old  Aghvank strictly speaking                situated north of the river Kura  26  Because the Armenian element was more homogeneous and more developed than the tribes living to the north of the Kura River  Armenians took over Caucasian Albania s political life and were progressively able to impose their language and culture  27  28  Whatever little is known about Nagorno Karabakh and other eastern Armenian peopled territories in the early Middle Ages comes from the text History of the Land of Aghvank                               attributed to two Armenian authors  Movses Kaghankatvatsi and Movses Daskhurantsi  29  30  This text  written in Old Armenian  in essence represents the history of Armenia s provinces of Artsakh and Utik  27 Kaghankatvatsi  repeating Movses Khorenatsi  mentions that the very name  Aghvank   Albania  is of Armenian origin  and relates it to the Armenian word  aghu         meaning  kind    benevolent   31  Khorenatsi states that aghu was a nickname given to Prince Arran  whom the Armenian king Vagharshak I appointed as governor of northeastern provinces bordering on Armenia  According to a legendary tradition reported by Khorenatsi  Arran was a descendant of Sisak  the ancestor of the Siunid dynasty that ruled Armenia s province of Syunik  and thus a great grandson of the ancestral eponym of the Armenians  the Forefather Hayk  32  33  Kaghankatvatsi and another Armenian author  Kirakos Gandzaketsi  confirm Arran s belonging to Hayk s blood line by calling Arranshahiks  a Haykazian dynasty   34  In the 5th century s Nagorno Karabakh  King Vachagan II the Pious  ruler of the Kingdom of Aghvank  adopted the so called Constitution of Aghven                       a code of civil regulations consisting of 21 articles and composed after a series of talks with leading clerical and civil figures of Armenia and Aghvank  e g  Bishop of Syunik   35  36  In the 8th century  the Constitution of Aghven was included in the Armenian Book of Laws                    by the head of the Armenian Apostolic Church Hovhan III Odznetsi  Catholicos from 717 728   thus laying out a blueprint for later era Armenian legal texts  such as the Lawcode written in the 12th century by Mkhitar Gosh  37  38  39  The Constitution of Aghven usually features as an inclusion in Movses Kaghankatvatsi s History of the Land of Aghvank  40  Armenian culture and civilization flourished in the early medieval Nagorno Karabakh  In the 5th century  the first ever Armenian school was opened on the territory of modern Nagorno Karabakh at the Amaras Monastery by the efforts of St  Mesrob Mashtots  the inventor of the Armenian alphabet  41  42  St  Mesrob was very active in preaching Gospel in Artsakh and Utik  Overall  Mesrob Mashtots made three trips to Artsakh and Utik  ultimately reaching pagan territories at the foothills of the Greater Caucasus   43  44  The 7th century Armenian linguist and grammarian Stephanos Syunetsi stated in his work that Armenians of Artsakh had their own dialect  and encouraged his readers to learn it  45  In the same 7th century  Armenian poet Davtak Kertogh writes his Elegy on the Death of Grand Prince Juansher  where each passage begins with a letter of Armenian script in alphabetical order  46  30  High Middle Ages Main article  Artsakh In the 7th and 8th centuries  the region was ruled by Caliphate appointed local governors  In 821 the Armenian prince Sahl Smbatian revolted in Artsakh and established the House of Khachen  which ruled Artsakh as a principality until the early 19th century  47  The name  Khachen  originated from Armenian word  khach   which means  cross   48  By 1000 the House of Khachen proclaimed the Kingdom of Artsakh with John Senecherib as its first ruler  49  Initially Dizak  in southern Artsakh  formed also a kingdom ruled by the ancient House of Aranshahik  descended of the earliest Kings of Caucasian Albania  In 1261  after the daughter of the last king of Dizak married to the king of Artsakh  the two states merged into one  47  Subsequently Artsakh continued to exist as a principality  In the 15th century  the territory of Karabakh was part of the states ruled by Kara Koyunlu and Ak Koyunlu tribal confederations  The Turkoman lord Jahan Shah  1437 67  assigned the governship of upper Karabakh to local Armenian princes  allowing a native Armenian leadership to emerge consisting of five noble families led by princes who held the titles of meliks  47  These dynasties represented the branches of the earlier House of Khachen and were the descendants of the medieval kings of Artsakh  Their lands were often referred to as the Country of Khamsa  five in Arabic   The Russian Empire recognized the sovereign status of the five princes in their domains by a charter of the Emperor Paul I dated 2 June 1799  50  Late Middle Ages The Askeran fortress  built by the Karabakh Khanate ruler Panah Ali Khan in the 18th century In the early 16th century  after the fall of the Ak Koyunlu state  control of the region passed to the Safavid dynasty  which created the Karabakh Beylerbeylik  Despite these conquests  the population of Upper Karabakh remained largely Armenian  51  Initially under the control of the Ganja Khanate of the Persian Empire  the local Armenian princes were granted a wide degree of autonomy by the Safavid Empire over the modern territory of Nagorno Karabakh and adjacent lands  The Armenian meliks maintained full control over the region until the mid 18th century  51  In the early 18th century  Persia s Nader Shah took Karabakh out of control of the Ganja khans in punishment for their support of the Safavids  and placed it under his own control 52  53  At the same time  the Armenian meliks were granted supreme command over neighboring Armenian principalities and Muslim khans in the Caucasus  in return for the meliks  victories over the invading Ottoman Turks in the 1720s  54  These five principalities in Karabakh were ruled by Armenian families who had received the title Melik  prince  and were the following  the principality of Gulistan  under the leadership of the Melik Biglarian family  the principality of Djrabert under the leadership of the Melik Israelian family  the principality of Khatchen  under the leadership of the Hassan Djalalian family  the principality of Varanda  under the leadership of the Melik Shahnazarian and finally  the principality of Tizk  under the leadership of the Melik Avanian family  55  In the mid 18th century  as internal conflicts between the meliks led to their weakening  51  the Karabakh Khanate was formed  56  Modern era Karabakh became a protectorate of the Imperial Russia by the Kurekchay Treaty  signed between Ibrahim Khalil Khan of Karabakh and general Pavel Tsitsianov on behalf of Tsar Alexander I in 1805  according to which the Russian monarch recognized Ibrahim Khalil Khan and his descendants as the sole hereditary rulers of the region  57  58  59  Its new status was confirmed under the terms of the Treaty of Gulistan  1823   when Persia formally ceded Karabakh to the Russian Empire  60  61  62  63  before the rest of Transcaucasia was incorporated into the Empire in 1828 by the Treaty of Turkmenchay  In 1822  the Karabakh Khanate was dissolved  and the area became part of the Elisabethpol Governorate within the Russian Empire  After the transfer of the Karabakh Khanate to Russia  many Azerbaijani Muslim families emigrated to Persia  while many Armenians were induced by the Russian government to emigrate from Persia to Karabakh  64  Soviet era Main article  Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast The present day conflict over Nagorno Karabakh has its roots in the decisions made by Joseph Stalin and the Caucasian Bureau  Kavburo  during the Sovietization of Transcaucasia  Stalin was the acting Commissar of Nationalities for the Soviet Union during the early 1920s  the branch of the government under which the Kavburo was created  After the Russian Revolution of 1917  Karabakh became part of the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic  but this soon dissolved into separate Armenian  Azerbaijani  and Georgian states  Over the next two years  1918 20   there were a series of short wars between Armenia and Azerbaijan over several regions  including Karabakh  In July 1918  the First Armenian Assembly of Nagorno Karabakh declared the region self governing and created a National Council and government  65  Later  Ottoman troops entered Karabakh  meeting armed resistance by Armenians  After the defeat of Ottoman Empire in World War I  British troops occupied Karabakh  51  The British command provisionally affirmed Khosrov bey Sultanov  appointed by the Azerbaijani government  as the governor general of Karabakh and Zangezur  pending final decision by the Paris Peace Conference  66  The decision was opposed by Karabakh Armenians  In February 1920  the Karabakh National Council preliminarily agreed to Azerbaijani jurisdiction  while Armenians elsewhere in Karabakh continued guerrilla fighting  never accepting the agreement  51  65  The agreement itself was soon annulled by the Ninth Karabagh Assembly  which declared union with Armenia in April  51  65  67  In April 1920  while the Azerbaijani army was locked in Karabakh fighting local Armenian forces  Azerbaijan was taken over by Bolsheviks  51  On August 10  1920  Armenia signed a preliminary agreement with the Bolsheviks  agreeing to a temporary Bolshevik occupation of these areas until final settlement would be reached  68  In 1921  Armenia and Georgia were also taken over by the Bolsheviks who  in order to attract public support  promised they would allot Karabakh to Armenia  along with Nakhchivan and Zangezur  the strip of land separating Nakhchivan from Azerbaijan proper   However  the Soviet Union also had far reaching plans concerning Turkey  hoping that it would  with a little help from them  develop along Communist lines  Needing to placate Turkey  the Soviet Union agreed to a division under which Zangezur would fall under the control of Armenia  while Karabakh and Nakhchivan would be under the control of Azerbaijan  Had Turkey not been an issue  Stalin would likely have left Karabakh under Armenian control  69  As a result  the Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast was established within the Azerbaijan SSR on July 7  1923  With the Soviet Union firmly in control of the region  the conflict over the region died down for several decades  With the beginning of the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s and early 1990s  the question of Nagorno Karabakh re emerged  Accusing the Azerbaijani SSR government of conducting forced azerification of the region  the majority Armenian population  with ideological and material support from the Armenian SSR  started a movement to have the autonomous oblast transferred to the Armenian SSR  The oblast s borders were drawn to include Armenian villages and to exclude as much as possible Azerbaijani villages  The resulting district ensured an Armenian majority  70  In August 1987 Karabakh Armenians sent petition for union with Armenia tens of thousands of signatures to Moscow 71   War and secession Main article  Nagorno Karabakh War A restored Armenian T 72  knocked out of commission while attacking Azeri positions in Askeran  serves as a war memorial on the outskirts of Stepanakert  On February 13  1988  Karabakh Armenians began demonstrating in their capital  Stepanakert  in favour of unification with the Armenian republic  Six days later they were joined by mass marches in Yerevan  On February 20 the Soviet of People s Deputies in Karabakh voted 110 to 17 to request the transfer of the region to Armenia  This unprecedented action by a regional soviet brought out tens of thousands of demonstrations both in Stepanakert and Yerevan  but Moscow rejected the Armenians  demands  On February 22  1988  the first direct confrontation of the conflict occurred as a large group of Azeris marched from Agdam against the Armenian populated town of Askeran   wreaking destruction en route   The confrontation between the Azeris and the police near Askeran degenerated into the Askeran clash  which left two Azeris dead  one of them reportedly killed by an Azeri police officer  as well as 50 Armenian villagers  and an unknown number of Azerbaijanis and police  injured  72  73  Large numbers of refugees left Armenia and Azerbaijan as violence began against the minority populations of the respective countries  74  In the fall of 1989  intensified inter ethnic conflict in and around Nagorno Karabakh led the Soviet Union to grant Azerbaijani authorities greater leeway in controlling the region  citation needed  On November 29  1989 direct rule in Nagorno Karabakh was ended and the region was returned to Azerbaijani administration  75  The Soviet policy backfired  however  when a joint session of the Armenian Supreme Soviet and the National Council  the legislative body of Nagorno Karabakh  proclaimed the unification of Nagorno Karabakh with Armenia  citation needed  In 1989  Nagorno Karabakh had a population of 192 000  76  The population at that time was 76  Armenian and 23  Azerbaijanis  with Russian and Kurdish minorities  76  On November 26  1991 Azerbaijan abolished the status of Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast  rearranging the administrative division and bringing the territory under direct control of Azerbaijan  77  On December 10  1991 in a referendum boycotted by local Azerbaijanis  73  Armenians in Nagorno Karabakh approved the creation of an independent state  A Soviet proposal for enhanced autonomy for Nagorno Karabakh within Azerbaijan satisfied neither side  and a full scale war subsequently erupted between Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh  the latter receiving support from Armenia  78  79  80  81  According to Armenia s former president  Levon Ter Petrossian  the Karabakh leadership approach was maximalist and  they thought they could get more   82  83  84  The struggle over Nagorno Karabakh escalated after both Armenia and Azerbaijan attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991  In the post Soviet power vacuum  military action between Azerbaijan and Armenia was heavily influenced by the Russian military  Furthermore  both the Armenian and Azerbaijani military employed a large number of mercenaries from Ukraine and Russia  85  As many as one thousand Afghan mujahideen participated in the fighting on Azerbaijan s side  73  There were also fighters from Chechnya fighting on the side of Azerbaijan  73  Many survivors from the Azerbaijani side found shelter in 12 emergency camps set up in other parts of Azerbaijan to cope with the growing number of internally displaced people due to the Nagorno Karabakh war  86  By the end of 1993  the conflict had caused thousands of casualties and created hundreds of thousands of refugees on both sides  citation needed  By May 1994  the Armenians were in control of 14  of the territory of Azerbaijan  At that stage  for the first time during the conflict  the Azerbaijani government recognized Nagorno Karabakh as a third party in the war  and started direct negotiations with the Karabakh authorities  51  As a result  a cease fire was reached on May 12  1994 through Russian negotiation  Contemporary situation  since 1994  Further information  Madrid Principles  Prague Process  Armenian Azerbaijani   Nagorno Karabakh Declaration  Astrakhan Declaration  and Land

Nagorno Karabakh  Prior to the meeting  President Aliyev once more threatened to resort to military force to reestablish control over the region if the two sides did not reach an agreeable settlement at the summit  96  The ceasefire agreement is being breached on a regular basis by both sides  Some major incidents and skirmishes include the killing of three Azerbaijani soldiers and wounding one as

an enclave surrounded entirely by Azerbaijan  its nearest point to Armenia is across the Lachin corridor  roughly 4 kilometers across  107  Approximately half of Nagorno Karabakh terrain is over 950 m above sea level  108  The borders of Nagorno Karabakh resemble a kidney bean with the indentation on the east side  It has tall mountain ridges along the northern edge and along the west and a mountainous south  The part near the indentation of the kidney bean itself is a relatively flat valley  with the two edges of the bean  the provinces of Martakert and Martuni  having flat lands as well  Other flatter valleys exist around the Sarsang reservoir  Hadrut  and the south  The entire region lies  on average  1 100 metres  3 600 ft  above sea level  108  Notable peaks include the border mountain Murovdag and the Great Kirs mountain chain in the junction of Shusha Rayon and Hadrut  The territory of modern Nagorno Karabakh forms a portion of the historic region of Karabakh  which lies between the rivers Kura and Araxes  and the modern Armenia Azerbaijan border  Nagorno Karabakh in its modern borders is part of the larger region of Upper Karabakh  Nagorno Karabakh s environment vary from steppe on the Kura lowland through dense forests of oak  hornbeam and beech on the lower mountain slopes to birchwood and alpine meadows higher up  The region possesses numerous mineral springs and deposits of zinc  coal  lead  gold  marble and limestone  109  The major cities of the region are Stepanakert  which serves as the capital of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic  and Shusha  which lies partially in ruins  Vineyards  orchards and mulberry groves for silkworms are developed in the valleys  110  Demographics 1700s Concrete numbers about the demographic situation in Nagorno Karabakh appear since the 18th century  Archimandrite Minas Tigranian  after completing his secret mission to Persian Armenia ordered by the Russian Tsar Peter the Great stated in a report dated March 14  1717 that the patriarch of the Gandzasar Monastery  in Nagorno Karabakh  had under his authority 900 Armenian villages  111  In his letter of 1769 to Russia s Count P  Panin  the Georgian king Erekle II  in his description of Nagorno Karabakh  suggests   Seven families rule the region of Khamse  Its population is totally Armenian    112  113  When discussing Karabakh and Shusha in the 18th century  the Russian diplomat and historian S  M  Bronevskiy  Russian                    indicated in his Historical Notes that Karabakh  which he said  is located in Greater Armenia  had as many as 30 40 000 armed Armenian men in 1796  114  1800s A survey prepared by the Russian imperial authorities in 1823  several years before the 1828 Armenian migration from Persia to the newly established Armenian Province  shows that all Armenians of Karabakh compactly resided in its highland portion  i e  on the territory of the five traditional Armenian principalities in Nagorno Karabakh  and constituted an absolute demographic majority on those lands  The survey s more than 260 pages recorded that the district of Khachen had twelve Armenian villages and no Tatar  Muslim  villages  Jalapert  Jraberd  had eight Armenian villages and no Tatar villages  Dizak had fourteen Armenian villages and one Tatar village  Gulistan had twelve Armenian and five Tatar villages  and Varanda had twenty three Armenian villages and one Tatar village  115  116  1900s During the Soviet times  leader of Azerbaijan SSR tried to change demographic balance in the Nagorno Karabakh
