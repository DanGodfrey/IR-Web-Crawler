v t e The economic history of the United States has its roots in European colonization in the 16th  17th  and 18th centuries  Marginal colonial economies grew into 1 small  independent farming economies  which joined together in 1776 to form the United States of America  In 230 years the United States grew to a huge  integrated  industrialized economy that makes up nearly a quarter of the world economy  The main causes were a large unified market  a supportive political legal system  vast areas of highly productive farmlands  vast natural resources  especially timber  coal  iron  and oil   and an entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to investing in material and human capital  The economy has maintained high wages  attracting immigrants by the millions from all over the world

Pre colonial In 1492  Christopher Columbus  sailing under the Spanish flag  set out to find Asia and happened upon a  New World   For the next 100 years  Spanish  Portuguese  Dutch  English and French explorers sailed from Europe for the New World  looking for gold  riches  religious merit  honor  and imperial power  But north of Mexico there was little glory and less gold  so most did not stay  The people who eventually did settle arrived later  In 1565 a small fort at St  Augustine  Florida  was founded by the Spanish  and in 1607 a small band of settlers built England s first permanent settlement in what was to become the United States at Jamestown  While they traded among themselves  Native Americans lacked immunities when European explorers began arriving after 1492  bringing new microbes  Their economic systems  for example the economy of the Iroquois  involved various combinations of hunting and gathering and farming  Native American economies were profoundly altered by the arrival of Europeans and the resulting arrival of new diseases  influx of European goods  business relations with the Europeans regarding the fur trade  acquisition of horses  firearms and alcohol  engagement in wars  loss of land  and confinement to reservations  1   edit  Colonial era Shipping scene in Salem  Massachusetts  a shipping hub  in the 1770s Early settlers had a variety of reasons for coming to America  The Puritans of Massachusetts wanted to create a purified religion in New England  Other colonies  such as Virginia  were founded principally as business ventures  England s success at colonizing what would become the United States was due in large part to its use of charter companies  Charter companies were groups of stockholders  usually merchants and wealthy landowners  who sought personal economic gain and  perhaps  wanted also to advance England s national goals  While the private sector financed the companies  the King provided each project with a charter or grant conferring economic rights as well as political and judicial authority  The colonies generally did not show quick profits  however  and the English investors often turned over their colonial charters to the settlers  The political implications  although not realized at the time  were enormous  The colonists were left to build their own lives  their own communities  and their own economy  Throughout the colonies  people lived primarily on small farms and were self sufficient  In the few small cities and among the larger plantations of South Carolina  and Virginia  some necessities and virtually all luxuries were imported in return for tobacco  rice  and indigo exports  2  Small local industries emerged as the colonies grew  such as sawmills  and gristmills  Entrepreneurs established shipyards to build fishing fleets and  in time  trading vessels and built iron forges  By the 18th century  regional patterns of development had become clear  the New England colonies relied on shipbuilding and sailing to generate wealth  plantations  many using slave labor  in Maryland  Virginia  and the Carolinas grew tobacco  rice  and indigo  and the middle colonies of New York  Pennsylvania  New Jersey  and Delaware shipped general crops and furs  Except for slaves  standards of living were generally high higher  in fact  than in England itself  3   edit  New England The New England region s economy grew steadily over the entire colonial era  despite the lack of a staple crop that could be exported  All the province and many towns as well  tried to foster economic growth by subsidizing projects that improved the infrastructure  such as roads  bridges  inns and ferries  They gave bounties and subsidies or monopolies to sawmills  grist mills  iron mills  pulling mills  which treated cloth   salt works and glassworks  Most important  colonial legislatures set up a legal system that was conducive to business enterprise by resolving disputes  enforcing contracts  and protecting property rights  Hard work and entrepreneurship characterized the region  as the Puritans and Yankees endorsed the  Protestant Ethic   which enjoined men to work hard as part of their divine calling  4  The benefits of growth were widely distributed in New England  reaching from merchants to farmers to hired laborers  The rapidly growing population led to shortages of good farm land on which young families could establish themselves  one result was to delay marriage  and another was to move to new lands farther west  In the towns and cities  there was strong entrepreneurship  and a steady increase in the specialization of labor  Wages for men went up steadily before 1775  new occupations were opening for women  including weaving  teaching  and tailoring  The region bordered New France  and in the numerous wars the British poured money in to purchase supplies  build roads and pay colonial soldiers  The coastal ports began to specialize in fishing  international trade and shipbuilding and after 1780 in whaling  Combined with a growing urban markets for farm products  these factors allowed the economy to flourish despite the lack of technological innovation  5   edit  American Revolution Americans in the Thirteen Colonies demanded their rights as Englishmen  as they saw it  to select their own representatives to govern and tax them   which Britain refused  The Americans attempted resistance through boycotts of British manufactured items  but the British responded with a rejection of American rights and the Intolerable Acts of 1774  6  In turn  the Americans launched the American Revolution  resulting in an all out war against the British and to independence for the new United States of America  The British tried to crush the American economy with a blockade of all ports  but with 90  of the people in farming  and only 10  in cities  the American economy proved resilient and able to support a sustained war  which lasted 1775 1783  7  Revolutionary era cartoon showing US sawing of the horn of a cow  symbolizing a break from British commerce  with a distressed Englishman watching as other European powers wait to collect milk  The cartoon represents the commercial status of the US during the Revolution  The American Revolution  1775 1783  brought a dedication to unalienable rights to  life  liberty  and the pursuit of happiness   which emphasize individual liberty and economic entrepreneurship  and simultaneously a commitment to the political values of republicanism  which emphasize civic virtue and duty  and promotion of the general welfare  Britain s war against the Americans  French and Spanish cost about  100 million  The Treasury borrowed 40  of the money it needed and raised the rest through an efficient system of taxation  8  9  Heavy spending brought France to the verge of bankruptcy and revolution  Congress and the American states had no end of difficulty financing the war  10  In 1775 there was at most 12 million dollars in gold in the colonies  not nearly enough to cover current transactions  let alone on a major war  The British made the situation much worse by imposing a tight blockade on every American port  which cut off almost all imports and exports  One partial solution was to rely on volunteer support from militiamen  and donations from patriotic citizens  Another was to delay actual payments  pay soldiers and suppliers in depreciated currency  and promise it would be made good after the war  Indeed  in 1783 the soldiers and officers were given land grants to cover the wages they had earned but had not been paid during the war  Not until 1781  when Robert Morris was named Superintendent of Finance of the United States  did the national government have a strong leader in financial matters  Morris used a French loan in 1782 to set up the private Bank of North America to finance the war  Seeking greater efficiency  Morris reduced the civil list  saved money by using competitive bidding for contracts  tightened accounting procedures  and demanded the federal government s full share of money and supplies from the states  11  Congress used four main methods to cover the cost of the war  which cost about 66 million dollars in specie  gold and silver   12  Congress made two issues of paper money  in 1775 1780  and in 1780 81  The first issue amounted to 242 million dollars  This paper money would supposedly be redeemed for state taxes  but the holders were eventually paid off in 1791 at the rate of one cent on the dollar  By 1780  the paper money was  not worth a Continental   as people said  and a second issue of new currency was attempted  The second issue quickly became nearly worthless but it was redeemed by the new federal government in 1791 at 100 cents on the dollar  At the same time the states  especially Virginia and the Carolinas  issued over 200 million dollars of their own currency  In effect  the paper money was a hidden tax on the people  and indeed was the only method of taxation that was possible at the time  The skyrocketing inflation was a hardship on the few people who had fixed incomes but 90 percent of the people were farmers  and were not directly affected by that inflation  Debtors benefited by paying off their debts with depreciated paper  13  The greatest burden was borne by the soldiers of the Continental Army  whose wages usually in arrears declined in value every month  weakening their morale and adding to the hardships suffered by their families  Beginning in 1777  Congress repeatedly asked the states to provide money  But the states had no system of taxation either  and were little help  By 1780 Congress was making requisitions for specific supplies of corn  beef  pork and other necessities an inefficient system that kept the army barely alive  14  15  Starting in 1776  the Congress sought to raise money by loans from wealthy individuals  promising to redeem the bonds after the war  The bonds were in fact redeemed and 1791 at face value  but the scheme raised little money because Americans had little specie  and many of the rich merchants were supporters of the Crown  Starting in 1776  the French secretly supplied the Americans with money  gunpowder and munitions in order to weaken its arch enemy  Great Britain  When France officially entered the war in 1778  the subsidies continued  and the French government  as well as bankers in Paris and Amsterdam loaned large sums to the American war effort  These loans were repaid in full in the 1790s  16   edit  New nation Chart 1  trends in economic growth  1700 1850 Frank Bourgin s 1989 study of the Constitutional Convention shows that direct government involvement in the economy was intended by the Founders  17  This had more to do with the perceived need to overcome the economic and financial chaos the nation suffered under the Articles of Confederation  and nothing to do with any desire to have a statist economy  The goal was to ensure that dearly won political independence was not lost by being economically and financially dependent on the powers and princes of Europe  The creation of a strong central government able to promote science  invention  industry and commerce  was seen as an essential means of promoting the general welfare and making the economy of the United States strong enough for them to determine their own destiny  Both the Revolution  and the creation of the Constitution and federal union  were motivated by specific beliefs that only a republican form of government could ensure political and economic freedom  that the goal of any good government was to promote the general welfare  and that the maintenance of republican government depended above all else on a sense of public virtue  or civic virtue  18  In his 1973 study of the economic principles established at the foundation of the United States  E A J  Johnson wrote  The general view  discernible in contemporaneous literature  was that the responsibility of government should involve enough surveillance over the enterprise system to ensure the social usefulness of all economic activity  It is quite proper  said Bordley  for individuals to  choose for themselves  how they will apply their labor and their intelligence in production  But it does not follow from this that  legislators and men of influence  are freed from all responsibility for giving direction to the course of national economic development  They must  for instance  discountenance the production of unnecessary commodities of luxury when common sense indicates the need for food and other essentials  Lawmakers can fulfill their functions properly only when they  become benefactors to the publick   in new countries they must safeguard agriculture and commerce  encourage immigration  and promote manufactures  Admittedly  liberty  is one of the most important blessings which men possess   but the idea that liberty is synonymous with complete freedom from restraint  is a most unwise  mistaken apprehension   True liberty demands a system of legislation that will lead all members of society  to unite their exertions  for the public welfare  It should therefore be the policy of government to aid and foster certain activities or kinds of business that strengthen a nation  even as it should be the duty of government to repress  those fashions  habits  and practices  which tend to weaken  impoverish  and corrupt the people    19  As John Kasson wrote  The questions of the introduction of domestic manufactures and the role that labor saving machines might play in American life were considered not as isolated economic issues but as matters affecting the entire character of society  No doubt profit motives existed  but would be manufacturers had to make cogent arguments which addressed broader ideological concerns   In addition to asking  How much will it pay   they had to consider as well   How will it advance the cause of republicanism   The question was not rhetorical   not at this time at least  20  The U S  Constitution  adopted in 1787  established that the entire nation was a unified  or common market  with no internal tariffs or taxes on interstate commerce  The extent of federal power was much debated  with Alexander Hamilton taking a very broad view as the first secretary of the treasury during the presidential administration of George Washington  He succeeded in building a strong national credit based on taking over the state debts and bundling them with the old national debt into new securities sold to the wealthy  They in turn now had an interest in keeping the new government solvent  Hamilton funded the debt with tariffs on imported goods and a highly controversial tax on whiskey  Hamilton believed the United States should pursue economic growth through diversified shipping  manufacturing  and banking  He sought and achieved Congressional authority to create the First Bank of the United States in 1791  the charter lasted until 1811  21  Thus  what emerged in the United States in the first half of the eighteenth century was a system of political economy that became known around the world as the American School 22   generally understood to be in opposition to the British system 23  that became known as laissez faire capitalism  24  The American System was inspired by the ideas of Alexander Hamilton  who proposed the creation of a government sponsored bank and increased tariffs to favor northern industrial interests  25  Following Hamilton s death  the more abiding protectionist influence in the antebellum period came from Henry Clay and his American System  26  Specific government programs and policies which gave shape and form to the American School and the American System include the establishment of the Patent Office in 1802  the creation of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1807 and other measures to improve river and harbor navigation  the various Army expeditions to the west  beginning with Lewis and Clark s Corps of Discovery in 1804 and continuing into the 1870s  almost always under the direction of an officer from the Army Corps of Topographical Engineers  and which provided crucial information for the overland pioneers that followed  the assignment of Army Engineer officers to assist or direct the surveying and construction of the early railroads and canals  the establishment of the First Bank of the United States and Second Bank of the United States as well as various protectionist measures  e g   the tariff of 1828   Thomas Jefferson and James Madison opposed a strong central government  and  consequently  most of Hamilton s economic policies   but they could not stop Hamilton  who wielded immense power and political clout in the Washington administration  In 1801  however  Jefferson became president and turned to promoting a more decentralized  agrarian democracy called Jeffersonian democracy   He based his philosophy on protecting the common man from political and economic tyranny  He particularly praised small farmers as  the most valuable citizens    However  Jefferson did not change Hamilton s basic policies  As president in 1811 Madison let the bank charter expire  but the War of 1812 proved the need for a national bank and Madison reversed positions  The Second Bank of the United States was established in 1816  with a 20 year charter  27  The War of 1812  by cutting off almost all foreign trade  created a home market for goods made in the U S   even if they were more expensive   changing an early tendency toward free trade into a protectionism characterized by nationalism and protective tariffs  28  The experience of this war led the War Department to issue a request for contract proposals for firearms with interchangeable parts  Previously  parts from one firearm had to be carefully hand fitted to another firearm  almost all infantry regiments necessarily included an artificer or armorer who could perform this intricate gunsmithing  The requirement for interchangeable parts forced forward the development of modern metal working machine tools  including milling machines  grinders  shapers and planers  The development of these modern machine tools made possible the development of modern industry capable of mass production   29  30  31  32  From the 1830s to 1860  Congress repeatedly rejected Whig calls for higher tariffs  and its policies of of Economic nationalism  which included increased state control  regulation and macroeconomic development of infrastructure  33  President Andrew Jackson  for example  destroyed the Second Bank of the United States  The tariff was lowered time and again before the Civil War  Proposals to fund massive western railroad projects  or to give free land to homesteaders  were defeated by Southerners afraid these policies would strengthen the North  The Civil War changed everything   edit  Expansion and growth  The First Cotton Gin  conjectural image from 1869 Cotton  at first a small scale crop in the South  boomed following Eli Whitney s invention in 1793 of the cotton gin  a machine that separated raw cotton from seeds and other waste  Soon  large plantations  based on slave labor  expanded in the richest lands from the Carolinas westward to Texas  The raw cotton was shipped to textile mills in Britain  France and New England  34  Millions moved to the more fertile farmland of the Midwest  States built roads and waterways  such as the Cumberland Pike  1818  and the Erie Canal  1825   opening up markets for western farm products  The Whig Party supported Clay s American System  which proposed to build internal improvements  e g  roads  canals and harbors   protect industry  and create a strong national bank  The Whig legislation program was blocked at the national level by the Democrats  but similar modernization programs were enacted in most states on a bipartisan basis  35  Scene of Lockport on the Erie Canal  W  H  Bartlett 1839  President Andrew Jackson  1829 1837   leader of the new Democratic Party  opposed the Second Bank of the United States  which he believed favored the entrenched interests of rich  When he was elected for a second term  Jackson blocked the renewal of the bank s charter  Jackson opposed paper money and demanded the government be paid in gold and silver coins  The Panic of 1837 stopped business growth for three years  36   edit  Railroads Main article  Rail transport in the United States Railroads made a decisive impact on the U S  economy especially in the 1850 1873 era  making possible the transition to an urban industrial nation with high finance and advanced managerial skills  Railroads opened up remote areas  drastically cut the cost of moving freight as well as passenger travel  and stimulated new industries such as steel and telegraphy  as well as the profession of civil engineering  They greatly increased the importance of such hubs as made cities such as Atlanta  Billings  Chicago  and Dallas  37  Railroad executives invented modern methods for running large scale business operations  creating a blueprint that all large corporations basically followed  They created career tracks that took 18 year old boys and turned them into brakemen  conductors and engineers  38  They were first to encounter managerial complexities  labor union issues  and problems of geographical competition  Due to these radical innovations  the railroad became the first large scale business enterprise and the model for most large corporations  39  Panics did not curtail rapid U S  economic growth during the 19th century  Long term demographic growth  expansion into new farmlands  and creation of new factories continued  New inventions and capital investment led to the creation of new industries and economic growth  As transportation improved  new markets continuously opened  The steamboat made river traffic faster and cheaper  but development of railroads had an even greater effect  opening up vast stretches of new territory for development  Like canals and roads  railroads received large amounts of government assistance in their early building years in the form of land grants  But unlike other forms of transportation  railroads also attracted a good deal of domestic and European private investment  40  Nevertheless  a combination of vision and foreign investment  combined with the discovery of gold and a major commitment of America s public and private wealth  enabled the nation to develop a large scale railroad system  establishing the base for the country s industrialization  Table 1  RAILROAD MILEAGE INCREASE BY GROUPS OF STATES 1850 1860 1870 1880 1890 New England 2 507 3 660 4 494 5 982 6

the nation s income came from manufacturing  Urbanized industry was limited primarily to the Northeast  cotton cloth production was the leading industry  with the manufacture of shoes  woolen clothing  and machinery also expanding  Most of the workers in the new factories were immigrants or their children  Between 1845 and 1855  some 300 000 European immigrants arrived annually  Many remained in eastern cities  especially mill towns and mining camps  while those with farm experience and some savings bought farms in the West  41   edit  Civil War The Union grew rich fighting the war  as the Confederate economy was destroyed  42  The Republicans in control in Washington had a Whig vision of an industrial nation  with great cities  efficient factories  productive farms  national banks  and high speed rail links  The South had resisted policies such as tariffs to promote industry and homestead laws to promote farming because slavery would not benefit  with the South gone  and Northern Democrats very weak in Congress  the Republicans enacted their legislation  At the same time they passed new taxes to pay for part of the war  and issued large amounts of bonds to pay for the most of the rest   The remainder can be charged to inflation   They wrote an elaborate program of economic modernization that had the dual purpose of winning the war and permanently transforming the economy  43  Historians have debated whether the Civil War speeded up the rate of economic growth in the face of destruction throughout the South and the diversion resources to military supplies and away from civilian goods  In any case the war taught new organizational methods  prioritized engineering skills  and shifted the national attention from politics to business  44   edit  Treasury In 1860 the Treasury was a small operation that funded the small scale operations of the government through the low tariff and land sales  45  Revenues were trivial in comparison with the cost of a full scale war  but the Treasury Department under Secretary Salmon P  Chase showed unusual ingenuity in financing the war without crippling the economy  46  Many new taxes were imposed  and always with a patriotic theme comparing the financial sacrifice to the sacrifices of life and limb  The government paid for supplies in real money  which encouraged people to sell to the government regardless of their politics  By contrast the Confederacy gave paper promissory notes when it seized property  so that even loyal Confederates would hide their horses and mules rather than sell them for dubious paper  Overall the Northern financial system was highly successful in raising money and turning patriotism into profit  while the Confederate system impoverished its patriots  47  The United States needed  3 1 billion to pay for the immense armies and fleets raised to fight the Civil War   over  400 million just in 1862  48  The largest tax sum by far came from new excise taxes  a sort of value added tax  that was imposed on every sort of manufactured item  Second came much higher tariffs  through several Morrill tariff laws  Third came the nation s first income tax  only the wealthy paid and it was repealed at war s end  Apart from taxes  the second major source was government bonds  For the first time bonds in small denominations were sold directly to the people  with publicity and patriotism as key factors  as designed by banker Jay Cooke  State banks lost their power to issue banknotes  Only national banks could do that  and Chase made it easy to become a national bank  it involved buying and holding federal bonds and financiers rushed to open these banks  Chase numbered them  so that the first one in each city was the  First National Bank   49  Fourth the government printed  greenbacks   paper money  which were controversial because they caused inflation  Secretary Chase  though a long time free trader  worked with Congressman Justin Morrill to pass a second tariff bill in summer 1861  raising rates another 10 points in order to generate more revenues  50  These subsequent bills were primarily revenue driven to meet the war s needs  though they enjoyed the support of protectionists such as Carey  who again assisted Morrill in the bill s drafting  The Morrill Tariff of 1861 was designed to raise revenue  The tariff act of 1862 served not only to raise revenue  but also to encourage the establishment of factories free from British competition by taxing British imports  Furthermore  it protected American factory workers from low paid European workers  and as a major bonus attracted tens of thousands of those Europeans to immigrate to America for high wage factory and craftsman jobs  51   edit  Land grants Homesteaders in central Nebraska in 1886 The U S  government owned vast amounts of good land  mostly from the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and the Oregon Treaty with Britain in 1846   The challenge was to make the land useful to people and to provide the economic basis for the wealth that would pay off the war debt  Land grants went to railroad construction companies to open up the western plains and link up to California  Together with the free lands provided farmers by the Homestead Law the low cost farm lands provided by the land grants speeded up the expansion of commercial agriculture  The North s most important war measure was perhaps the creation of a system of national banks that provided a sound currency for the industrial expansion  Even more important  the hundreds of new banks that were allowed to open were required to purchase government bonds  Thereby the nation monetized the potential wealth represented by farms  urban buildings  factories  and businesses  and immediately turned that money over to the Treasury for war needs   edit  Agriculture Agriculture was the largest single industry and it prospered during the war  52  53  Prices were high  pulled up by a strong demand from the army and from Britain  which depended on American wheat for a fourth of its food imports   The war acted as a catalyst which encouraged the rapid adoption of horse drawn machinery and other implements  The rapid spread of recent inventions such as the reaper and mower made the work force efficient  even as hundreds of thousands of farmers were in the army  Many wives took their place  and often consulted by mail on what to do  increasingly they relied on community and extended kin for advice and help  54  The 1862 Homestead Act opened up the public domain lands for free  Land grants to the railroads meant they could sell tracts for family farms  80 to 200 acres  at low prices with extended credit  In addition the government sponsored fresh information  scientific methods and the latest techniques through the newly established Department of Agriculture and the Morrill Land Grant College Act  55   edit  Collapse of South See also  economy of the Confederate States of America The wartime devastation of the South was great and poverty ensued  incomes of whites dropped  but income of the former slaves rose  During Reconstruction railroad construction was heavily subsidized  with much corruption   but the region maintained its dependence on cotton  Former slaves became wage laborers  tenant farmers  or sharecroppers  They were joined by many poor whites  as the population grew faster than the economy  As late as 1940 the only significant manufacturing industries were textile mills  mostly in the in the upland Carolinas  and some steel in Alabama  56  The industrial advantages of the North over the South helped secure a Northern victory in the American Civil War  1861 1865   The Northern victory sealed the destiny of the nation and its economic system  The slave labor system was abolished  the world price of cotton plunged  making the large southern cotton plantations much less profitable  Northern industry  which had expanded rapidly before and during the war  surged ahead  Industrialists came to dominate many aspects of the nation s life  including social and political affairs  41   edit  The Gilded Age  1865 1900 Steel workers in 1905  Meadville  Philadelphia Main article  Gilded Age The rapid economic development following the Civil War laid the groundwork for the modern U S  industrial economy  By 1890  the USA leaped ahead of Britain for first place in manufacturing output  57  An explosion of new discoveries and inventions took place  a process called the  Second Industrial Revolution   Railroads greatly expanded the mileage and built stronger tracks and bridges that handled heavier cars and locomotives  carrying far more goods and people at lower rates  Refrigeration railroad cars came into use  The telephone  phonograph  typewriter and electric light were invented  By the dawn of the 20th century  cars had begun to replace horse drawn carriages  58  Parallel to these achievements was the development of the nation s industrial infrastructure  Coal was found in abundance in the Appalachian Mountains from Pennsylvania south to Kentucky  Oil was discovered in western Pennsylvania  it was mainly used for lubricants and for kerosene for lamps  Large iron ore mines opened in the Lake Superior region of the upper Midwest  Steel mills thrived in places where these coal and iron ore could be brought together to produce steel  Large copper and silver mines opened  followed by lead mines and cement factories  59  In 1913 Henry Ford introduced the assembly line  a step in the process that became known as mass production  Frederick W  Taylor pioneered the field of scientific management in the late 19th century  carefully plotting the functions of various workers and then devising new  more efficient ways for them to do their jobs  After 1910 mass production was sped by the electrification of factories  which replaced water power  60  1904 cartoon entitled  Next   depicting Standard Oil as a ruthless octopus The  Gilded Age  of the second half of the 19th century was the epoch of tycoons  Many Americans came to idealize these businessmen who amassed vast financial empires  Often their success lay in seeing the long range potential for a new service or product  as John D  Rockefeller did with oil  They were fierce competitors  single minded in their pursuit of financial success and power  Other giants in addition to Rockefeller and Ford included Jay Gould  who made his money in railroads  J  Pierpont Morgan  banking  and Andrew Carnegie  steel  Some tycoons were honest according to business standards of their day  others  however  used force  bribery  and guile to achieve their wealth and power  For better or worse  business interests acquired significant influence over government  Morgan operated on a grand scale in both his private and business life  He and his companions gambled  sailed yachts  gave lavish parties  and built palatial homes  Morgan was also a lay leader of the Episcopal Church and one of the world s leading art collectors  In contrast  men such as Rockefeller and Ford exhibited puritanical qualities  They retained small town values and lifestyles  As church goers  they felt a sense of responsibility to others  They believed that personal virtues could bring success  theirs was the gospel of work and thrift  Later their heirs would establish the largest philanthropic foundations in America  While upper class European intellectuals generally looked on commerce with disdain  most Americans living in a society with a more fluid class structure enthusiastically embraced the idea of moneymaking  They enjoyed the risk and excitement of business enterprise  as well as the higher living standards and potential rewards of power and acclaim that business success brought  61  Real gross national product per capita of the United States 1869 1918 Pork packing in Cincinnati  1873 The Gilded Age saw the greatest period of economic growth in American history  After the short lived panic of 1873  the economy recovered with the advent of hard money policies and industrialization  From 1869 to 1879  the US economy grew at a rate of 6 8  for real GDP and 4 5  for real GDP per capita  despite the panic of 1873  62  The economy repeated this period of growth in the 1880s  in which the wealth of the nation grew at an annual rate of 3 8   while the GDP was also doubled  Economist Milton Friedman states that for the 1880s  The highest decadal rate  of growth of real reproducible  tangible wealth per head from 1805 to 1950  for periods of about ten years was apparently reached in the eighties with approximately 3 8 percent  63   However  Raymond W  Goldsmith  who originated the figures Friedman gives in this statement  had reservations about the data  stating that  a few of these are too much influenced by the cyclical position of the benchmark years or by possible errors in the estimates for the initial or terminal year to constitute measures of long term trend   Goldsmith specifically compared his figures for the 1880s and 1890s  stating  that while 1880 and 1890 were years of prosperity  1900 marked a cyclical trough  and that measures of economic activity eliminating trend are considerably higher for the  eighties than for the  nineties   64  Austrian Economist and scholar Murray Rothbard stated that for the 1880s  Gross domestic product almost doubled from the decade before  a far larger percentage jump decade on decade than any time since  63  Capital investment also increased tremondously during the 1880s  increasing nearly 500   while capital formation doubled during the decade  Rothbard states that  This massive 500 percent decade on decade increase has never since been even closely rivaled  It stands in particular contrast to the virtual stagnation witnessed by the 1970s  65  Long term interest rates also declined to 3 to 3 5  for the first time  reaching the same level as Britain and 17th century Holland  66  The American labor movement began with the first significant labor union  the Knights of Labor in 1869  The Knights collapsed in the 1880s and were displaced by strong international unions that banded together as the American Federation of Labor under Samuel Gompers  Rejecting socialism  the AFL unions negotiated with owners for higher wages and better working conditions  Union growth was slow until 1900  then grew to a peak during World War I  67  To modernize traditional agriculture reformers founded the Grange movement  in 1867  Federal land grants helped each state create an agricultural college and a network of extension agents who demonstrated modern techniques to farmers  Wheat and cotton farmers in the 1890s supported the Populist movement  but failed in their demands for free silver and inflation  Instead the 1896 election committed the nation to the gold standard and a program of sustained industrialization  During the period  a series of recessions happened Panic of 1873 had New York Stock Exchange closed for ten days  of the country s 364 railroads  89 went bankrupt  a total of 18 000 businesses failed between 1873 and 1875  unemployment reached 14  by 1876  during a time which became known as the Long Depression  The end of the Gilded Age coincided with the Panic of 1893  a deep depression that lasted until 1897 and

hour workday demonstration in New York  1871  A political cartoon symbolically depicting President Wilson using tariff  currency  and anti trust laws to prime the pump and get the economy working  Main article  Progressive Era In the early years of American history  most political leaders were reluctant to involve the federal government too heavily in the private sector  except in the area of transportation  In general  they accepted the concept of laissez faire  a doctrine opposing government interference in the economy except to maintain law and order  This attitude started to change during the latter part of the 19th century  when small business  farm  and labor movements began asking the government to intercede on their behalf  68  By the turn of the century  a middle class had developed that was leery of both the business elite and the somewhat radical political movements of farmers and laborers in the Midwest and West  Known as Progressives  these people favored government regulation of business practices to  in their minds  ensure competition and free enterprise  Congress enacted a law regulating railroads in 1887  the Interstate Commerce Act   and one preventing large firms from controlling a single industry in 1890  the Sherman Antitrust Act   These laws were not rigorously enforced  however  until the years between 1900 and 1920  when Republican President Theodore Roosevelt  1901 1909   Democratic President Woodrow Wilson  1913 1921   and others sympathetic to the views of the Progressives came to power  Many of today s U S  regulatory agencies were created during these years  including the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal Trade Commission  Ida M  Tarbell wrote a series of articles against the Standard Oil monopoly  The series helped pave the way for the breakup of the monopoly  68  Noon hour in a furniture factory  Indianapolis  Indiana  1908 Muckrakers were journalists who encouraged readers to demand more regulation of business  Upton Sinclair s The Jungle  1906  showed America the horrors of the Chicago Union Stock Yards  a giant complex of meat processing that developed in the 1870s  The federal government responded to Sinclair s book with the new regulatory Food and Drug Administration  When Democrat Woodrow Wilson was elected President with a Democratic Congress in 1912 he implemented a series of progressive policies  In 1913  the Sixteenth Amendment was ratified  and the income tax was instituted in the United States  Wilson resolved the longstanding debates over tariffs and antitrust  and created the Federal Reserve  a complex business government partnership that to this day dominates the financial world  In 1913  Henry Ford  adopted the moving assembly line  with each worker doing one simple task in the production of automobiles  Taking his cue from developments during the progressive era  Ford offered a very generous wage  5 a day to his workers  arguing that a mass production enterprise could not survive if average workers could not buy the goods  However  the wage increase did not extend to women  and Ford expanded the company s Sociological Department to monitor his workers and ensure that they did not spend their new found bounty on  vice and cheap thrills   69  Electrification in the U S  started in industry ca  1900 and by 1930 about 80  of power used in industry was electric  Electric utilities with central generating stations using steam turbines greatly lowered the cost of power with businesses and houses in cities becoming electrified  Electric street railways developed into a major mode of transportation  and electric inter urban service connected many cities in the northeast and mid west  Tractors began being mass produced   edit  Roaring twenties  1920 1929 People filing tax forms in 1920 Main article  Roaring Twenties Under Republican President Warren G  Harding  who called for normalcy and an end to high wartime taxes  Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon raised the tariff  cut other taxes  and used the large surplus to reduce the federal debt by about a third from 1920 to 1930  Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover worked to introduce efficiency  by regulating business practices  This period of prosperity  along with the culture of the time  was known as the Roaring Twenties  The rapid growth of the automobile industry stimulated industries such as oil  glass  and road building  Tourism soared and consumers with cars had a much wider radius for their shopping  Small cities prospered  and large cities had their best decade ever  with a boom in construction of offices  factories and homes  The new electric power industry transformed both business and everyday life  Telephones and electricity spread to the countryside  but farmers never recovered from the wartime bubble in land prices  Millions migrated to nearby cities  However  in October 1929  the Stock market crashed and banks began to fail in the Wall Street Crash of 1929  70   edit  Great Depression  1929 1941 Main article  Great Depression in the United States Stock exchange trading floor after the 1929 crash Missouri migrants living in a truck in California  Many displaced people moved to California to look for work during the Depression  John Steinbeck depicted the situation in The Grapes of Wrath Following the stock market crash  the economy plunged into the Great Depression  The Federal Reserve Board did not cause the depression but it made no effort to intervene by helping banks  The money supply fell by one third  and it was hard to get a loan  In his last year as president  Herbert Hoover passed a massive tax increase to boost sagging federal revenues  and signed the protectionist Smoot Hawley Tariff  which incited retaliation by Canada  Britain  Germany and other trading partners  Economists generally agree that these measures deepened an already serious crisis  By 1932  the unemployment rate was 25   Conditions were worse in heavy industry  lumbering  export agriculture  cotton  wheat  tobacco   and mining  Conditions were not quite as bad in white collar sectors and in light manufacturing  71  Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected President in 1932 without a specific program  He relied on a highly eclectic group of advisors who patched together many programs  known as the New Deal  Government spending increased from 8 0  of GNP under Hoover in 1932 to 10 2  of GNP in 1936  While Roosevelt balanced the  regular  budget the emergency budget was funded by debt  which increased from 33 6  of GNP in 1932 to 40 9  in 1936  72 Deficit spending had been recommended by some economists  most notably John Maynard Keynes in Britain  Roosevelt met Keynes but did not pay attention to his recommendations  After a meeting with Keynes  who kept drawing diagrams  Roosevelt remarked that  He must be a mathematician rather than a political economist   73  The extent to which the spending for relief and public works provided a sufficient stimulus to revive the U S  economy  or whether it harmed the economy  is also debated  If one defines economic health entirely by the gross domestic product  the U S  had gotten back on track by 1934  and made a full recovery by 1936  but as Roosevelt said  one third of the nation was ill fed  ill housed and ill clothed  See Chart 3  GNP was 34  higher in 1936 than 1932  and 58  higher in 1940 on the eve of war  The economy grew 58  from 1932 to 1940 in 8 years of peacetime  and then grew another 56  from 1940 to 1945 in 5 years of wartime  The unemployment rate fell from 25 2  in 1932 to 13 9  in 1940 when the draft started  During the war the economy operated under so many different conditions that comparison is impossible with peacetime  such as massive spending  price controls  bond campaigns  controls over raw materials  prohibitions on new housing and new automobiles  rationing  guaranteed cost plus profits  subsidized wages  and the draft of 12 million soldiers  The late 1930s saw the start of the  Great Compression   when New Deal policies strengthening unions and the war made taxation highly progressive  raised the take home income of the working class and lowered that of top earners  74  Chart 3  GDP annual pattern and long term trend  1920 40  in billions of constant dollars 75  In 1995 conservative economist Robert Whaples from Wake Forest University stated that measuring the effect of the New Deal remains a thorny issue for economists because it s so difficult to measure the effects it had on the country  One small survey by Whaples showed that 49  of those economists surveyed felt that the New Deal lengthened and deepened the depression  while 51  disagreed  76  The same survey also showed that only 5  of professional historians and 27  of professional economists felt the same way  However  economist Eric Rauchway of the University of California stated  very few people disapprove of most of the New Deal reforms   which include Social Security  the Securities and Exchange Commission  the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp   and Fannie Mae  Regardless  unemployment peaked in 1932 at 25  and was reduced to 13 9  by 1940  77  As Broadus Mitchell summarized   Most indexes worsened until the summer of 1932  which may be called the low point of the depression economically and psychologically   78  Economic indicators show the American economy declined until February 1933  After Roosevelt took office  there began a steady  sharp upward recovery that persisted until the brief Recession of 1937 1938  see graph  after which they continued their upward climb  Thus the Federal Reserve Index of Industrial Production bottomed at 52 8 on July 1  1932 and was practically unchanged at 54 3 on March 1  1933  however by July 1  1933  it had climbed to 85 5  with 1935 39   100  and for comparison 2005   1 342   79  Table 2  Depression Data 80  1929 1931 1933 1937 1938

Converted consumer products plants filled many military orders  Automakers built tanks and aircraft  for example  making the United States the  arsenal of democracy   In an effort to prevent rising national income and scarce consumer products to cause inflation  the newly created Office of Price Administration controlled rents on some dwellings  rationed consumer items ranging from sugar to gasoline  and otherwise tried to restrain price increases  81  Six million women took jobs in manufacturing and production  most were newly created temporary jobs in munitions  Some were replacing men away in the military  These working women were symbolized by the fictional character of Rosie the Riveter  After the war many women returned to household work as men returned from military service  The nation turned to the suburbs  as a pent up demand for new housing was finally unleashed  82   edit  Postwar prosperity  1945 1973 Further information  Post World War II economic expansion The period from the end of World War II to the early 1970s was a golden era of American capitalism   200 billion in war bonds matured  and the G I  Bill financed a well educated work force  The middle class swelled  as did GDP and productivity  The U S  underwent a kind of golden age of economic growth  This growth was distributed fairly evenly across the economic classes  which some attribute to the strength of labor unions in this period labor union membership peaked historically in the U S  during the 1950s  in the midst of this massive economic growth  Much of the growth came from the movement of low income farm workers into better paying jobs in the towns and cities a process largely completed by 1960  Congress created the Council of Economic Advisors  to promote high employment  high profits and low inflation  The Eisenhower administration  1953 1961  supported an activist contracyclical approach that helped to establish Keynesianism as a bipartisan economic policy for the nation  Especially important in formulating the CEA response to the recession accelerating public works programs  easing credit  and reducing taxes were Arthur F  Burns and Neil H  Jacoby    I am now a Keynesian in economics   proclaimed Republican President Richard Nixon in 1969  83  Although this period brought economic expanding to the country as whole  it was not recession proof  The recessions of 1945  1949  1953  1958  and 1960 saw a drastic decline in GDP  The  Baby Boom  saw a dramatic increase in fertility in the period 1942 1957  it was caused by delayed marriages and childbearing during depression years  a surge in prosperity  a demand for suburban single family homes  as opposed to inner city apartments  and new optimism about the future  The boom crested about 1957  then slowly declined  84   edit  Liberal programs Federal taxes on incomes  profits and payrolls had risen to high levels during World War II and had been cut back only slowly  the highest rates for individuals reached the 90  level  Congress cut tax rates in 1964  President Lyndon B  Johnson  1963 69  dreamed of creating a  Great Society   and began many new social programs to that end  such as Medicaid and Medicare  The government financed some of private industry s research and development throughout these decades  most notably ARPANET  which would become the Internet   85   edit  Inflation woes  1970s The postwar boom ended with a number of events in the early 1970s  the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971 the growing influx of imported manufacturing goods  such as automobiles and electronics the 1973 oil crisis  the 1973 1974 stock market crash  and the ensuing displacement of Keynesian economics by monetarist economics  especially by the free market Chicago School of Economics  led by theorist Milton Friedman  At the same time  the consensus among experts moved against New Deal style regulation  in favor of deregulation  In the late 1960s it was apparent to some that this juggernaut of economic growth was slowing down  and it began to become visibly apparent in the early 1970s  The United States grew increasingly dependent on oil importation from OPEC after peaking production in 1970  resulting in oil supply shocks in 1973 and 1979  Stagflation gripped the nation  and the government experimented with wage and price controls under President Nixon  The Bretton Woods Agreement collapsed in 1971 1972  and President Nixon closed the gold window at the Federal Reserve  taking the United States entirely off the gold standard  President Gerald Ford introduced the slogan   Whip Inflation Now   WIN   In 1974  productivity shrunk by 1 5   though this soon recovered  In 1976  Jimmy Carter won the Presidency  Carter would later take much of the blame for the even more turbulent economic times to come  though some who   say circumstances were outside his control  Inflation continued to climb skyward  Productivity growth was small  when not negative  Interest rates remained high  with the prime reaching 20  in January 1981  Art Buchwald quipped that 1980 would go down in history as the year when it was cheaper to borrow money from the Mafia than the local bank  85  Unemployment dropped mostly steadily from 1975 to 1979  although it then began to rise sharply  This period also saw the increased rise of the environmental and consumer movements  and the government established new regulations and regulatory agencies such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration  the Consumer Product Safety Commission  the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  and others   edit  Deregulation and Reaganomics  1976 1992 Deregulation gained momentum in the mid 1970s  spurred by slow productivity growth and increasing operation and capital costs in several key sectors  It was not until 1978 that the first meaningful deregulation legislation  the Airline Deregulation Act  was cleared by Congress  Transportation deregulation accelerated in 1980  with the deregulation of railroads and trucking  Deregulation of interstate buses followed in 1982  In addition to transportation deregulation  savings and loan associations and banks were partially deregulated with the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act in 1980 and the Garn St  Germain Depository Institutions Act in 1982  On a broader front  the economy initially recovered at a brisk pace from the 1973 75 recession  Incoming president Jimmy Carter instituted a large fiscal stimulus package in 1977 in order to boost the economy  However  inflation began a steep rise beginning in late 1978  and rose by double digits following the 1979 energy crisis  In order to combat inflation  Carter appointed Paul Volcker to the Federal Reserve  who raised interest rates and caused a sharp recession in the first six months of 1980  86  In March 1980  Carter introduced his own policies for reducing inflation  and the Federal Reserve brought down interest rates to cooperate with the initiatives  87  During the 1980 recession  manufacturing shed 1 1 million jobs  while service industries remained intact  Employment in automotive manufacturing in particular suffered  experiencing a 33  reduction by the end of the recession  88  Collectively these factors contributed to the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980  The Federal Reserve once again began to raise interest rates in 1981  which plunged the economy back into recession  Unemployment rose to a peak of 10 8  in December 1982  a post war high  89  In 1981  Ronald Reagan introduced Reaganomics  That is  fiscally expansive economic policies  cutting marginal federal income tax rates by 25   Inflation dropped dramatically from 13 5  annually in 1980 to just 3  annually in 1983 due to a short recession and the Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker s tighter control of the money supply and interest rates  Real GDP began to grow after contracting in 1980 and 1982  The unemployment rate continued to rise to a peak of 10 8  by late 1982  but dropped well under 6  unemployment at the end of Reagan s presidency in January 1989  The gap between those in the upper socioeconomic levels and those in the lower socioeconomic levels increased during Reagan s presidency  and the federal debt spawned by his policies tripled  from  930 billion in 1981 to  2 6 trillion in 1988   reaching record levels  90  Though debt almost always increased under every president in the latter half of the 20th century  it declined as a percentage of GDP under all Presidents after 1950 and prior to Reagan  In addition to the fiscal deficits  the U S  started to have large trade deficits  Also it was during his second term that the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was passed  Vice President George H  W  Bush was elected to succeed Reagan in 1988  The early Bush Presidency s economic policies were sometimes seen as a continuation of Reagan s policies  but in the early 1990s  Bush went back on a promise and increased taxes in a compromise with Congressional Democrats  He ended his presidency on a moderate note  signing regulatory bills such as the Americans With Disabilities Act  and negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement  In 1992  Bush and third party candidate Ross Perot lost to Democrat Bill Clinton  91  The advent of deindustrialization in the late 1960s and early 1970s saw income inequality increase dramatically to levels never seen before  But at the same time  most orthodox economists  and most policy makers  pointed to the fact that consumers could buy so many goods  even with the inflation of the 1970s  as evidence that the general shift away from manufacturing and into services was creating widespread prosperity  In 1968  the U S  Gini coefficient was 0 386  about equivalent to Japan   381   though still above that of the United Kingdom   368  and Canada   331   However  in the years since  increased free trade  globalization and high corporate taxes  and the desire to escape more stringent environmental and workplace safety regulations in the U S   have caused U S  companies to begin to shift their manufacturing and heavy industrial operations to second  and third world countries with lower labor costs  One result has been that income inequality in the U S  has risen dramatically  In 2005  the American Gini coefficient had reached 0 469  similar to that of Malaysia and the Philippines  both at  461  and well ahead of China   440   Critics of economic policies favored by Republican and Democratic administrations since the 1960s  particularly those expanding  free trade  and  open markets   see Neoliberalism  say that these policies  though benefiting trading as well as the cost of products in the U S   could have taken their own on the prosperity of the American middle class  But in this period  consumers were buying as never before with so many products and goods at such low costs and in high quantities  Critics however argued that this consumer behavior was giving a false reading of the health of the economy  because it was being paid for by taking on rapidly increasing levels of indebtedness  thus covering up the stagnating wages and earnings of most of the workforce   edit  The Rise of Globalization and a World Superpower  1990s late 2000s Main article  New Economy This graph shows three major stock indices

2000  however  it was evident a bubble in stock valuations had occurred  such that beginning in March 2000  the market would give back some 50  to 75  of the growth of the 1990s  The economy worsened in 2001 with output increasing only 0 3  and unemployment and business failures rising substantially  and triggering a recession that is often blamed on the September 11 attacks  citation needed  An

Colorado  Vice President Joe Biden stands behind him  Further information  Financial crisis  2007 present  and Automotive industry crisis of 2008 2010 In 2008 a perfect storm of economic disasters hit the country and indeed the entire world  The most serious began with the collapse of housing bubbles in California and Florida  and the collapse of housing prices and the construction industries  Millions of mortgages  averaging about  200 000 each  had been bundled into securities called collateralized debt obligations that were resold worldwide  Many banks and hedge funds had borrowed hundreds of billions of dollars to buy these securities  which were now  toxic  because their value was unknown and no one wanted to buy them  92  A series of the largest banks in the U S  and Europe collapsed  some went bankrupt  such as Lehman Brothers with  690 billion in assets  others such as the leading insurance company AIG  the leading bank Citigroup  and the two largest mortgage companies were bailed out by the government  Congress voted  700 billion in bailout money  and the Treasury and Federal Reserve committed trillions of dollars to shoring up the financial system  but the measures did not reverse the declines  Banks drastically tightened their lending policies  despite infusions of federal money  It became much harder to get car loans  for example citation needed   The government for the first time took major ownership positions in the largest banks  JFK  The stock market plunged 40   wiping out tens of trillions of dollars in wealth  housing prices fell 20  nationwide wiping out trillions more  By late 2008 distress was spreading beyond the financial and housing sectors  especially as the  Big Three  of the automobile industry  General Motors  Ford and Chrysler  were on the verge of bankruptcy  and the retail sector showed major weaknesses  Critics of the  700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program  TARP  expressed anger that much of the TARP money that has been distributed to banks is seemingly unaccounted for  with banks being secretive on the issue  93  President Barack Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 in February 2009  the bill provides  787 billion in stimulus through a combination of spending and tax cuts  The plan is largely based on the Keynesian theory that government spending should offset the fall in private spending during an economic downturn  otherwise the fall in private spending may perpetuate itself and productive resources  such as the labor hours of the unemployed  will be wasted  Critics claim that government spending cannot offset a fall in private spending because government must borrow money from the private sector in order to add money to it  However  most economists do not think such  crowding out  is an issue when interest rates are near zero and the economy is stagnant  Opponents of the stimulus also point to problems of possible future inflation and government
