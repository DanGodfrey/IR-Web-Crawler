Latgalians  Selonians  Semigallians citation needed   in Latvian  kur i  latga i  s  i and zemga i   as well as the Livonians  l bie i  speaking a Finnic language   edit  The Medieval period Although the local people had had contact with the outside world for centuries  they were more fully integrated into European society in the 12th century  21  The first missionaries  sent by the Pope  sailed up the Daugava River in the late 12th century  seeking converts  22  The local people  however  did not convert to Christianity as readily as hoped  22 German crusaders were sent into Latvia to convert the pagan population by force of arms  23  In the beginning of the 13th century  large parts of today s Latvia were ruled by Germans  22  Together with Southern Estonia  these conquered areas formed the crusader state that became known as Terra Mariana or Livonia  In 1282  Riga  and later the cities of C sis  Limba i  Koknese and Valmiera  were included in the Hanseatic League  22  Riga became an important point of east west trading 22  and formed close cultural contacts with Western Europe citation needed    edit  The Reformation period The 16th  17th  and 18th centuries were a time of great change for the inhabitants of Latvia  including the reformation  the collapse of the Livonian state  and the time when the Latvian territory was divided up among foreign powers  After the Livonian War  1558 1583   Livonia  Latvia  fell under Polish and Lithuanian rule  22  The southern part of Estonia and the northern part of Latvia were ceded to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and formed into the Ducatus Ultradunensis  P rdaugavas hercogiste   Gotthard Kettler  the last Master of the Order of Livonia  formed the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia citation needed   Though the duchy was a vassal state to Poland  it retained a considerable degree of autonomy and experienced a golden age in the 17th century  Latgalia  the easternmost region of Latvia  became a part of the Polish district of Inflanty  The 17th and early 18th centuries saw a struggle between the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth  Sweden  and Russia for supremacy in the eastern Baltic  After the Polish Swedish War  1600 1611   northern Livonia  including Vidzeme  came under Swedish rule  Fighting continued sporadically between Sweden and Poland until the Truce of Altmark in 1629 citation needed   In Latvia  the Swedish period is generally remembered as positive  serfdom was eased  a network of schools was established for the peasantry  and the power of the regional barons was diminished  24  25  Several important cultural changes occurred during this time  Under Swedish and largely German rule  western Latvia adopted Lutheranism as its main religion  The ancient tribes of the Couronians  Semigallians  Selonians  Livs and northern Latgallians assimilated to form the Latvian people  speaking one Latvian language  Throughout all the centuries  however  no such thing as a Latvian state existed so the borders and definitions of who exactly fell within that group are largely subjective  Meanwhile  largely isolated from the rest of Latvia  southern Latgallians adopted Catholicism under Polish Jesuit influence  The native dialect remained distinct  although it acquired many Polish and Russian loanwords  26   edit  Latvia in the Russian Empire The Capitulation of Estonia and Livonia in 1710 and the Treaty of Nystad  ending the Great Northern War in 1721  gave Vidzeme to Russia  it became part of the Riga Governorate  citation needed   The Latgale region remained part of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth as Inflanty Voivodeship until 1772  when it was incorporated into Russia  The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia became an autonomous Russian province  the Courland Governorate  in 1795  bringing all of what is now Latvia into the Russian Empire  All three Baltic provinces preserved local laws  the local official language and their own parliament  the Landtag citation needed   During the Great Northern War  1700 1721   the Baltic area was once again the scene of great devastation  with Peter the Great s scorched earth policy  famine  and plague being responsible for catastrophic loss of human life  as much as 40  of the population in Latvian lands were killed  27  In 1710  the plague reached Riga  where it was active until 1711 and claimed the lives of about half the population  28  The promises Peter the Great made to the Baltic German nobility at the fall of Riga in 1710  confirmed by the Treaty of Nystad and known as  the Capitulations   largely reversed the Swedish reforms citation needed   The emancipation of the serfs took place in Courland in 1817 and in Vidzeme in 1819 citation needed   In practice  however  the emancipation was actually advantageous to the landowners and nobility citation needed   as it dispossessed peasants of their land without compensation  forcing them to return to work at the estates  of their own free will   During the 19th century  the social structure changed dramatically citation needed   A class of independent farmers established itself after reforms allowed the peasants to repurchase their land  but many landless peasants remained citation needed   There also developed a growing urban proletariat and an increasingly influential Latvian bourgeoisie  The Young Latvian  Latvian  Jaunlatvie i  movement laid the groundwork for nationalism from the middle of the century  many of its leaders looking to the Slavophiles for support against the prevailing German dominated social order citation needed   The rise in use of the Latvian language in literature and society became known as the First National Awakening  Russification began in Latgale after the Polish led the January Uprising in 1863  this spread to the rest of what is now Latvia by the 1880s citation needed   The Young Latvians were largely eclipsed by the New Current  a broad leftist social and political movement  in the 1890s  Popular discontent exploded in the 1905 Russian Revolution  which took a nationalist character in the Baltic provinces   edit  Declaration of Independence  Poland  amp  The New Baltic States  map from a British atlas in 1920  showing still undefined borders after the treaties of Brest and Versailles and before the Peace of Riga  K rlis Ulmanis World War I devastated the territory of what would become the state of Latvia  along with other western parts of the Russian Empire  Demands for self determination were at first confined to autonomy  but the Russian 1917 Revolution  treaty with Germany at Brest Litovsk  and allied armistice with Germany on November 11  1918  created a power vacuum  The People s Council of Latvia proclaimed the independence of the new country in Riga on November 18  1918  with K rlis Ulmanis becoming the head of the provisional government citation needed   The War of Independence that followed was part of a general chaotic period of civil and new border wars in Eastern Europe  By the spring of 1919  there were actually three governments   Ulmanis  government  the Soviet Latvian government led by P teris Stu ka  whose forces  supported by the Red Army  occupied almost all of the country  and the Baltic German government of the United Baltic Duchy  headed by Andrievs Niedra and supported by the Baltische Landeswehr and the German Freikorps unit Iron Division  Estonian and Latvian forces citation needed  defeated the Germans at the Battle of Wenden in June 1919  and a massive attack by a predominantly German force   the West Russian Volunteer Army   under Pavel Bermondt Avalov was repelled in November  Eastern Latvia was cleared of Red Army forces by Latvian and Polish troops in early 1920  from the Polish perspective the Battle of Daugavpils was a part of the Polish Soviet War  citation needed   A freely elected Constituent assembly convened on May 1  1920  and adopted a liberal constitution  the Satversme  in February 1922  29  The constitution was partly suspended by K rlis Ulmanis after his coup in 1934  but reaffirmed in 1990  Since then  it has been amended and is still in effect in Latvia today  With most of Latvia s industrial base evacuated to the interior of Russia in 1915  radical land reform was the central political question for the young state  In 1897  61 2  of the rural population had been landless  by 1936  that percentage had been reduced to 18   30  By 1923  the extent of cultivated land surpassed the pre war level  Innovation and rising productivity led to rapid growth of the economy  but it soon suffered from the effects of the Great Depression  Latvia showed signs of economic recovery and the electorate had steadily moved toward the centre during the parliamentary period citation needed   On May 15  1934  Ulmanis staged a bloodless coup  establishing a nationalist dictatorship that lasted until 1940  31  After 1934  Ulmanis established government corporations to buy up private firms with the aim of  Latvianising  the economy  32   edit  Latvia in World War II See also  Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940  Occupation of Latvia by Nazi Germany  The Holocaust in Latvia  Latvian partisans  and Latvian resistance movement  TWO WORLDS   Anti Sovietism propaganda board  Latvia  Summer  1941  Early in the morning of August 24  1939  the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a 10 year non aggression pact  called the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact  The pact contained a secret protocol  revealed only after Germany s defeat in 1945  according to which the states of Northern and Eastern Europe were divided into German and Soviet  spheres of influence   33  In the North  Latvia  Finland and Estonia were assigned to the Soviet sphere  33  Thereafter  Germany and the Soviet union invaded their respective portions of Poland  After the conclusion of the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact  most of the Baltic Germans left Latvia by agreement between Ulmanis  government and Nazi Germany under the Heim ins Reich program  34  In total 50 000 Baltic Germans left by the deadline of December 1939  with 1 600 remaining to conclude business and 13 000 choosing to remain in Latvia  34  Most of those who remained left for Germany in summer 1940  when a second resettlement citation needed  scheme was agreed  35  On 5 October 1939  Latvia was forced to accept a  mutual assistance  pact with the Soviet Union  granting the Soviets the right to station between 25 000 and 30 000 troops on Latvian territory  36  After staging border incidents  on 16 June 1940 the government of the USSR handed the Latvian ambassador in Moscow a note  in which Latvia was accused of breaching the articles of the agreement of 5 October 1939  and demands were made for sending in additional Soviet troops and to change the government  The Latvian government capitulated in the face of overwhelming force  On 17 June Soviet troops invaded Latvian territory  In his address by radio  K rlis Ulmanis  announced   Soviet forces are marching into our land this very morning  This is happening with the knowledge and consent of the government  which in turn stems from the amicable relations that exist between Latvia and the Soviet Union  It is  therefore  my wish that the residents of our country also show friendship towards the advancing military units     The government has resigned  I shall remain in my place  you remain in yours   No opposition was shown towards the Soviet forces  on the contrary  part of the population accepted the news of their arrival with enthusiasm  which was heavily exploited by Soviet propaganda  Observing them  the well known Russian lawyer and public figure of Latvia  Pyotr Yakobi  wrote   Taken from the German model  the authoritarian beginning in our country has turned into a government of national bureaucracy  having satisfied a limited circle of citizens  who have adapted themselves to the state pie  Clearly  any hardship is not in vain  And so now the down trodden have raised their voice and demand a return of their rights that have been trampled on        Among those unhappy with the regime of K rlis Ulmanis were not only the national minorities but also many Latvians who were anxious about the deteriorating economic situation and who had no desire to end up under the rule of Nazi Germany  The mass killings of 2 749 Jews on the beach near the city of Liep ja  December 1941  State administrators were liquidated and replaced by Soviet cadres  37  in which 34 250 Latvians were deported or killed  38  Elections were held with single pro Soviet candidates listed for many positions  the resulting people s assembly immediately requested admission into the USSR  which was granted by the Soviet Union  37  Latvia  then a puppet government  was headed by Augusts Kirhen teins  39  Latvia was incorporated into the Soviet Union on August 5  1940 as The Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic  The Soviets dealt harshly with their opponents   prior to the German invasion  in the course of less than a year  at least 27 586 persons were arrested  most were deported for cooperation with the German army citation needed   and about 945 persons were shot citation needed   While under German occupation  Latvia was administered as part of Reichskommissariat Ostland  Latvian paramilitary and Auxiliary Police units established by the occupation authority participated in the Holocaust as well  31  More than 200 000 Latvian citizens died during World War II  including approximately 75 000 Latvian Jews murdered during the Nazi occupation  31  Latvian soldiers fought on both sides of the conflict  including in the Latvian Legion of the Waffen SS  most of them conscripted by the occupying Nazi and Soviet authorities citation needed    edit  Soviet era Main articles  Occupation of Latvia by Soviet Union 1944 1945  Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic  and Stalinism In 1944 when the Soviet military advances reached the area heavy fighting took place in Latvia between German and Soviet troops which ended with another German defeat  During the course of the war  both occupying forces conscripted Latvians into their armies  in this way increasing the loss of the nation s  live resources   In 1944  part of the Latvian territory once more came under Soviet control  The Soviets immediately began to reinstate the Soviet system  After the German surrender it became clear that Soviet forces were there to stay  and Latvian national partisans  soon to be joined by German collaborators  began their fight against another occupier   the Soviet Union  40  File Shack from Gulag   Museum of the Occupation of Latvia JPG Reconstruction of shack from Gulag in museum Anywhere from 120 000 to as many as 300 000 Latvians took refuge from the Soviet army by fleeing to Germany and Sweden  41  Most sources count 200 000 to 250 000 refugees leaving Latvia  with perhaps as many as 80 000 to 100 000 of them recaptured by the Soviets or  during few months immediately after the end of war  42  returned by the West  43  The Soviets reoccupied the country in 1944 1945  and further deportations followed as the country was collectivised and Sovieticised  31  On March 25  1949  43 000 rural residents   kulaks   and Latvian patriots   nationalists   were deported to Siberia in a sweeping Operation Priboi in all three Baltic states  which was carefully planned and approved in Moscow already on January 29  1949  44  Between 136 000 and 190 000 Latvians  depending on the sources  were imprisoned  repressed or deported to Soviet concentration camps  the Gulag  in the post war years  from 1945 to 1952  45  Some managed to escape arrest and joined the partisans citation needed   In the post war period  Latvia was driven to adopt Soviet farming methods  Rural areas were forced into collectivisation  46  An extensive programme to impose bilingualism was initiated in Latvia  limiting the use of Latvian language in official uses in favor of using Russian as the main language  All of the minority schools  Jewish  Polish  Belorussian  Estonian  Lithuanian  were closed down leaving only two media of instructions in the schools  Latvian and Russian  47  An influx of labourers  administrators  military personnel and their dependents from Russia and other Soviet republics started  By 1959 about 400 000 persons arrived from other Soviet republics and the ethnic Latvian population had fallen to 62   48  Because Latvia had still maintained a well developed infrastructure and educated specialists it was decided in Moscow that some of the Soviet Union s most advanced manufacturing factories were to be based in Latvia  New industry was created in Latvia  including a major machinery factory RAF in Jelgava  electrotechnical factories in Riga  chemical factories in Daugavpils  Valmiera and Olaine  as well as some food and oil processing plants  49  However  there were not enough people to operate the newly built factories citation needed   In order to expand industrial production  skilled workers were transferred into the republic from all over the Soviet Union  decreasing the proportion of ethnic Latvians in the republic  50   edit  Restoration of independence Barricade in Riga to prevent the Soviet Army from reaching the Latvian Parliament  July 1991  In the second half of 1980s Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev started to introduce political and economic reforms in the Soviet Union  called glasnost and Perestroika  In the summer of 1987 the first large demonstrations were held in Riga at the Freedom Monument  a symbol of independence  In the summer of 1988 a national movement  coalescing in the Popular Front of Latvia  was opposed by the Interfront  The Latvian SSR  along with the other Baltic Republics was allowed greater autonomy  and in 1988 the old pre war Flag of Latvia was allowed to be used  replacing the Soviet Latvian flag as the official flag in 1990  In 1989  the Supreme Soviet of the USSR adopted a resolution on the  Occupation of the Baltic states   in which it declared that the occupation was  not in accordance with law   and not the  will of the Soviet people   Pro independence Popular Front of Latvia candidates gained a two thirds majority in the Supreme Council in the March 1990 democratic elections  On May 4  1990  the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR adopted the Declaration On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia  Latvian SSR was renamed Republic of Latvia  However  the central power in Moscow continued to regard Latvia as Soviet republic in 1990 1991 citation needed   In January 1991  Soviet political and military forces tried unsuccessfully to overthrow the Republic of Latvia authorities by occupying the central publishing house in Riga and establishing a Committee of National Salvation to usurp governmental functions citation needed   During the transitional period Moscow maintained many central Soviet state authorities in Latvia  In spite of this  73  of all Latvian residents confirmed their strong support for independence on March 3  1991  in a nonbinding advisory referendum citation needed   A large number of ethnic Russians also voted for the proposition citation needed   The Popular Front of Latvia had advocated that all permanent residents be eligible for Latvian citizenship  However  universal citizenship for all permanent residents was not adopted subsequently  majority of ethnical non latvians did not receive Latvian citizenship even thought they had voted for support of independence  Many of them were born in Latvia  but still became non citizens  Until 2011 more than half of non citizens have gone thought process of naturalization exams and received Latvian citizenship   Still today there are 290 660 non citizens of Latvia  which represent 14 1  of population  Those people have no citizenship of any country and cannot vote in Latvia  The Republic of Latvia declared the end of the transitional period and restored full independence on August 21  1991 in the aftermath of the failed Soviet coup attempt  3  Latvia became a member of the European Union in 2004 and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007  The Saeima  Latvia s parliament  was again elected in 1993  and Russia completed its military withdrawal in 1994  The major goals of Latvia in the 1990s  to join NATO and the European Union  were achieved in 2004  Language and citizenship laws have been opposed by many Russophones   Citizenship was not automatically extended to former Soviet citizens who settled during the Soviet occupation or to their subsequent offspring  This resulted in a situation where people who have lived and worked in Latvia for over 50 years were nonetheless unable to vote  which meant that Russian voice was largely excluded from the parliament and the government  citation needed  Children born to non nationals after the reestablishment of independence are automatically entitled to citizenship   Approximately 72  of Latvian citizens are Latvian  while 20  are Russian  less than 1  of non citizens are Latvian  while 71  are Russian  51  The government denationalised private property confiscated by the Soviet rule  returning it or compensating the owners for it  and privatised most state owned industries  reintroducing the prewar currency  Albeit having experienced a difficult transition to a liberal
