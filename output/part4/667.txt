Commonwealth of Dominica  is an island nation in the Lesser Antilles region of the Caribbean Sea  south southeast of Guadeloupe and northwest of Martinique  Its size is 750 square kilometres  290 sq mi  and the highest point in the country is Morne Diablotins  which has an elevation of 1 447 metres  4 747 ft   The Commonwealth of Dominica has an estimated population of 72 500  The capital is Roseau  Dominica has been nicknamed the  Nature Isle of the Caribbean  for its unspoiled natural beauty  It is the youngest island in the Lesser Antilles  still being formed by geothermal volcanic activity  as evidenced by the world s second largest boiling lake  The island features lush mountainous rainforests  home of many rare plant  animal  and bird species  There are xeric areas in some of the western coastal regions  but heavy rainfall can be expected inland  The Sisserou Parrot  also known as the Imperial Amazon   the island s national bird  is featured on the national flag  Dominica s economy is heavily dependent on tourism  agriculture and heavy taxation  Christopher Columbus named the island after the day of the week on which he spotted it  a Sunday  dominica in Latin   November 3  1493  In the hundred years after Columbus s landing  Dominica remained isolated  and even more Caribs settled there after being driven from surrounding islands as European powers entered the region  France formally ceded possession of Dominica to the Great Britain in 1763  Britain then established a colony on the island in 1805  The emancipation of African slaves occurred throughout the British Empire in 1834  and  in 1838  Dominica became the first British Caribbean colony to have a legislature controlled by a black majority  In 1896  the United Kingdom reassumed governmental control of Dominica  turning it into a Crown colony  Half a century later  from 1958 to 1962  Dominica became a province of the short lived West Indies Federation  In 1978  Dominica became an independent nation  Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 2 1 20th century 3 Geography and climate 4 Government and administrative divisions 5 Economy 6 Infrastructure 6 1 Air 6 2 Roads 7 Demographics 8

which was the day on which it was spotted by Christopher Columbus  Its pre Columbian name was  Wai tu kubuli   which means  Tall is her body   4  The indigenous people of the island  the Caribs  have the Carib Territory  a territory similar to the Indian reserves of North America  The official language is English in consequence of its history as a British colony  territory  and state  though a French creole is spoken by many  especially people of older generations  The demonym or adjective is  Dominican  in English  same as that for the Dominican Republic  but unlike the Dominican Republic  in which the stress is on the first  i   the stress is on the second  i    edit  History Main article  History of Dominica In 1635 France claimed Dominica along with all the other  Petite Antilles  but no settlement was attempted  Between 1642 and 1650 a French missionary Raymond Breton became the first regular European visitor to the island  In 1660 the French and English agreed that both Dominica and St  Vincent should not be settled  but instead left to the Caribs as neutral territory  Dominica was officially neutral for the next century  but the attraction of its resources remained  rival expeditions of English and French foresters were harvesting timber by the start of the 18th century  5  In 1715 the French established their first permanent settlements in Dominica following a revolt of  poor white  smallholders in the north of Martinique  known as La Gaoul   which caused an exodus of them to southern Dominica  In 1727 the first French commander  M  Le Grand  took charge of the island with a basic French government thus making Dominica formally a colony of France and the island was divided into districts or  quarters   6  As part of the 1763 Treaty of Paris that ended the Seven Years  War  the island became a British possession  In 1778  during the American Revolutionary War  the French mounted a successful invasion with the active cooperation of the population  The 1783 Treaty of Paris  which ended the war  returned the island to Britain  French invasions in 1795 and 1805 ended in failure  5  A linen market in Dominica in the 1770s In 1763  the British established a legislative assembly  representing only the white population  In 1831  reflecting a liberalization of official British racial attitudes  the Brown Privilege Bill conferred political and social rights on free non whites  Three African people were elected to the legislative assembly the following year  Following the abolition of slavery  in 1838 Dominica became the only British Caribbean colony to have an African controlled legislature in the 19th century  Most African legislators were smallholders or merchants who held economic and social views diametrically opposed to the interests of the small  wealthy English planter class  Reacting to a perceived threat  the planters lobbied for more direct British rule  5  In 1865  after much agitation and tension  the colonial office replaced the elective assembly with one that had one half of members who were elected and one half who were appointed  Planters allied with colonial administrators outmanoeuvred the elected legislators on numerous occasions  In 1871  Dominica became part of the Leeward Island Federation  The power of the African population progressively eroded  Crown Colony government was re established in 1896  All political rights for the vast majority of the population were effectively curtailed  Development aid  offered as compensation for disenfranchisement  proved to have a negligible effect  5   edit  20th century Following World War I  an upsurge of political consciousness throughout the Caribbean led to the formation of the Representative Government Association  Marshalling public frustration with the lack of a voice in the governing of Dominica  this group won one third of the popularly elected seats of the legislative assembly in 1924 and one half in 1936  Shortly thereafter  Dominica was transferred from the Leeward Island Administration and was governed as part of the Windwards until 1958  when it joined the short lived West Indies Federation  5  After the federation dissolved  Dominica became an associated state of the United Kingdom in 1967 and formally took responsibility for its internal affairs  On November 3  1978  the Commonwealth of Dominica was granted independence by the United Kingdom  5  Independence did little to solve problems stemming from centuries of economic underdevelopment  and in mid 1979  political discontent led to the formation of an interim government  It was replaced after the 1980 elections by a government led by the Dominica Freedom Party under Prime Minister Eugenia Charles  the Caribbean s first female prime minister  Chronic economic problems were compounded by the severe impact of hurricanes in 1979 and in 1980  In 1981 Dominica was threatened with a takeover by mercenaries  7  In 1981  a group of  mercenaries  led by Mike Perdue of Houston and Wolfgang Droege of Toronto  attempted to overthrow the government of Eugenia Charles  The North America mercenary group was to aid ex Prime Minister Patrick John and his Dominica Defence Force in regaining control of the island in exchange for control over the island s future development  The entire plan failed and the ship hired to transport the men of Operation Red Dog never even made it off the dock as the FBI was tipped off  The self titled mercenaries lacked any formal military experience and or training and the majority of the crew had been misled into joining the armed coup by the con man ringleader Mike Perdue  White supremacist Don Black was also jailed for his part in the attempt  which violated US neutrality laws  The book Bayou of Pigs  written by Stewart Bell  details the story of this missguided attempt to turn Dominica into a criminal paradise  By the end of the 1980s  the economy recovered  but weakened again in the 1990s because of a decrease in banana prices  5  In the January 2000 elections  the Edison James United Workers Party  UWP  was defeated by the Dominican Labour Party  DLP   led by Roosevelt P   Rosie  Douglas  Douglas died after only a few months in office and was replaced by Pierre Charles  who died in office in January 2004  Roosevelt Skerrit  also of the DLP  replaced Charles as Prime Minister  Under Prime Minister Skerrit s leadership  the DLP won elections in May 2005 that gave the party 12 seats in the 21 member Parliament to the UWP s 8 seats  An independent candidate affiliated with the DLP won a seat as well  Since that time  the independent candidate joined the government and one UWP member crossed the aisle  making the current total 14 seats for the DLP and 7 for the UWP  5   edit

first  New World  country that Christopher Columbus discovered  It is said that when his royal sponsors asked Christopher Columbus to describe this island in the  New World   he crumpled a piece of parchment roughly and threw it on the table   This   Columbus explained   is what Dominica looks like completely covered with mountains with nary a flat spot   citation needed  Morne Trois Pitons

Portsmouth  Dominica possesses the most pristine wilderness in the Caribbean  citation needed  Originally  it was protected by sheer mountains which led the European powers to build ports and agricultural settlements on other islands  More recently  the citizens of this island have sought to preserve its spectacular natural beauty by discouraging the type of high impact tourism which has damaged nature in most of the Caribbean  Visitors can find large tropical forests  including one which is on the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites  hundreds of streams  coastlines and coral reefs  The Sisserou parrot is Dominica s national bird and is indigenous to its mountain forests  The Caribbean Sea offshore of the island of Dominica is home to many cetaceans  Most notably a group of sperm whales live in this area year round  Other cetaceans commonly seen in the area include spinner dolphins  pantropical spotted dolphins and bottlenose dolphins  Less commonly seen animals include killer whales  false killer whales  pygmy sperm whales  dwarf sperm whales  Risso s dolphins  common dolphins  Atlantic spotted dolphins  humpback whales and Bryde s whales  This makes Dominica a destination for tourists interested in whale watching  Dominica is especially vulnerable to hurricanes as the island is located in what is referred to as the hurricane region  In 1979  Dominica was hit directly by category 5 Hurricane David  causing widespread and extreme damage  On August 17  2007  Hurricane Dean  a category 1 at the time  hit the island  A mother and her seven year old son died when a landslide caused by the heavy rains crushed their house  12  In another incident two people were injured when a tree fell on their house  13 Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit estimated that 100 to 125 homes were damaged  and that the agriculture sector was extensively damaged  in particular the banana crop  14  Roseau photographed from a docked cruise ship Typical landscape near the sea in Dominica

product  GDP  rates of Eastern Caribbean states  15  16  The country nearly had a financial crisis in 2003 and 2004  but Dominica s economy grew by 3 5  in 2005 and 4 0  in 2006  following a decade of poor performance  Growth in 2006 was attributed to gains in tourism  construction  offshore and other services  and some sub sectors of the banana industry  The International Monetary Fund  IMF  recently praised the Government of Dominica for its successful macroeconomic reforms  The IMF also pointed out remaining challenges  including the need for further reductions in public debt  increased financial sector regulation  and market diversification  5  Bananas and other agriculture dominate Dominica s economy  and nearly one third of the labour force works in agriculture  This sector  however  is highly vulnerable to weather conditions and to external events affecting commodity prices  In 2007  Hurricane Dean caused significant damage to the agricultural sector as well as the country s infrastructure  especially roads  In response to reduced European Union  EU  banana trade preferences  the government has diversified the agricultural sector by promoting the production of coffee  patchouli  aloe vera  cut flowers  and exotic fruits such as mango  guava  and papaya  Dominica has also had some success in increasing its manufactured exports  primarily soap  5  Dominica is mostly volcanic and has few beaches  therefore  tourism has developed more slowly than on neighboring islands  Nevertheless  Dominica s mountains  rainforests  freshwater lakes  hot springs  waterfalls  and diving spots make it an attractive eco tourism destination  Cruise ship stopovers have increased following the development of modern docking and waterfront facilities in Roseau  the capital  5  Out of 22 Caribbean islands tracked  Dominica had the fewest visitors in 2008  55 800 or 0 3  of the total   This was about half as many as visited Haiti  17  Dominica s currency is the East Caribbean Dollar  Dominica is a beneficiary of the Caribbean Basin Initiative  CBI  that grants duty free entry into the United States for many goods  Dominica also belongs to the predominantly English speaking Caribbean Community  CARICOM   the CARICOM Single Market and Economy  CSME   and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States  OECS   5  Dominica supposedly offers tax free status to companies locating from abroad  It is not known how many companies benefit from the tax free status because of the strict confidentiality the government enforces  although it is known many Internet businesses utilise Dominica for this reason  The Commonwealth of Dominica offers an official and legally mandated economic citizenship to those seeking a valid second passport  The nationality law of Dominica authorizes the government to waive the normal requirement of seven years of legal residence to acquire citizenship in exchange for a cash contribution  Total costs including all fees for a single applicant come to about  105 000  with an additional  25 000 specified for a spouse and up to two children under 18  The Dominican passport holders can travel without a visa  or obtain a visa upon entry  to nearly 90 countries and territories  Applying for Dominica citizenship requires interacting with official Government Approved Economic Citizenship Agents   edit  Infrastructure Main article  Transport in Dominica  edit  Air There are two small airports on the island  The primary airport  Melville Hall Airport  DOM   is on the northeast coast and is about a 45 minute drive from Portsmouth  The second is Canefield Airport  DCF   about 15 minutes from Roseau on the southwest coast  Melville Hall Airport is suitable for limited use of commercial jets because of runway length  Melville Hall currently has regular service by American Eagle winair and LIAT using twin turboprop aircraft like the De Havilland Dash 8  as well as Conviasa and Amerijet  which  using Boeing 727 Freighters  is the only airline with jet service to the republic  A runway extension and service upgrade project began at Melville Hall around 2006 and was finished in 2010   edit  Roads The only major highway on the island is the road was between Portsmouth and Roseau  It takes about one hour to drive from Portsmouth to Roseau  Private minibuses form the major public transport system  However  this  highway  is now under major reconstruction via help from the Chinese   edit  Demographics Main article  Demographics of Dominica The vast majority of Dominicans are of African descent  There is a significant mixed population  along with Indo Caribbean or East Indian groups  a small European origin minority  descendants of French  British  and Irish colonists  and there are small numbers of Lebanese  Syrians and Asians  Dominica is also the only Eastern Caribbean island that still has a population of pre Columbian native Caribs  who were exterminated or driven from neighbouring islands  There are only about 3 000 Caribs remaining  They live in eight villages on the east coast of Dominica  This special Carib Territory was granted by the British Crown in 1903  18  There are also about 1 000 medical students from the United States and Canada who study at the Ross University School of Medicine in Portsmouth  The population growth rate of Dominica is very low  due primarily to emigration to other countries  In the early 21st century  emigrant numbers for the most popular countries are as follows  the United States  8 560   the United Kingdom  6 739   Canada  605  and France  394   It has recently been noted that Dominica has a relatively large number of centenarians  As of March 2007  there are 22 centenarians out of the island s 70 000 inhabitants three times the average incidence of centenarianism in developed countries  19  The reasons for this are the subject of current research being undertaken at Ross University School of Medicine  About 80  of the population is Roman Catholic  though in recent years a number of Protestant churches have been established  There is also a small Muslim community in Dominica  and the nation s first mosque was built recently near Ross University  20  English is the official language of Dominica and is universally spoken and understood  However  because of historic French occupation during different times in history  and the island s location between the two French speaking departments of Martinique and Guadeloupe  Antillean Creole  based on French  is spoken by many people on the island  especially from the older generation  Because of a decline in its usage by the younger generation  initiatives have been set up in an effort to increase usage and promote this unique part of the nation s history and culture  The dialect of Dominica also includes Cocoy  along with Creole French based patois  Cocoy  or Kockoy  is a mix of Leeward Island English Creole and Dominican Creole  It is mainly spoken in the north eastern villages of Marigot and Wesley  21  As a result of this admixture of languages and heritage  Dominica is a member of both the English speaking Commonwealth and the French speaking La Francophonie  At the beginning of the twentieth century the Rose s Company  which produced Rose s lime juice  saw demand for its product outgrow its ability to supply the product from Montserrat  Their response to the situation was to buy land on Dominica and encourage Montserrat farm labourers to relocate  As a result there came to be two linguistic communities in Dominica  Over time there has been much intermarrying  but there are still traces of difference in origin  22   edit  Culture Main articles  Culture of Dominica and Music of Dominica Dominica s East coast territory of the Kalinago  tribe  Dominica is home to a wide range of people  Although it was historically occupied by several native tribes  the Arawaks and Kalinago Carib tribes remained by the time European settlers reached the island   Massacre  is a name of a river dedicated to the murders of the Native villagers by French and British settlers  because the river ran red with blood for days  Each  French and British  claimed the island and imported slaves from Africa  The remaining Caribs now live on a 3 700 acre  15 km2  territory on the east coast of the island  They elect their own chief  This mix of cultures is important to Dominica  Music and dance are important facets of Dominica s culture  The annual independence celebrations show an outburst of traditional song and dance preceded since 1997 by weeks of Creole expressions such as  Creole in the Park  and the  World Creole Music Festival   Dominica gained prominence on the international music stage when in 1973  Gordon Henderson founded the group Exile One and an original musical genre which he coined  Cadence lypso  which paved the way for modern Creole music  Other musical genres include  Jing ping  and  Cadence   Jing ping heavily features the accordion and is native to the island  Dominica s music is an intoxicating melange of Afro Cuban  African and European traditions  Popular artists over the years include Chubby and the Midnight Groovers  Bells Combo  the Gaylords  WCK  and Triple Kay  A Dominican drumming band The 11th annual World Creole Music Festival was the first activity held there since its completion on October 27  2007  part of the island s celebration of independence from Great Britain on November 3  A year long reunion celebration began in January 2008 marking 30 years of independence  Dominica is often seen as a society that is migrating from collectivism to that of individualism  The economy is a developing one that previously depended on agriculture  Signs of collectivism are evident in the small towns and villages which are spread across the island  Dominican cuisine is similar to that of other Caribbean countries  Common main courses comprise meat  usually chicken  but can be goat  lamb  or beef  covered in sauce  The sauces are either spicy pepper sauces  or concoctions made from local fruit  A huge variety of local fruit  from tamarind to passion fruit  are served on the island  usually in juice or sauce form  Soursop is peeled and eaten raw  Sorrel  a red flower that only blooms around Christmas  is boiled into a bright red drink  Typical dishes include  pelau   a one pot dish of rice and chicken  mountain chicken  frog   all types of local fish  frozen joys  a homemade flavored popsicle   and several types of  ground provisions    root vegetables including dasheen and tania   edit  Education The island has its own state college  formerly named Clifton Dupigny Community College  Some Dominicans get scholarships from the Cuban government to attend universities in Cuba  Others go to the University of the West Indies or to schools in the United Kingdom  the United States  or other countries for higher education  Ross University  23  a medical school  is located at Portsmouth  The Archbold Tropical Research and Education Center  24  a biological field station owned by Clemson University  25  is located at Springfield Estate between
