for a state university  11  It would be the first public university west of the Mississippi River  12  To secure the university  the citizens of Columbia and Boone County pledged  117 921 in cash and land to beat out five other central Missouri counties for the location of the state university  12  The land on which the university was eventually constructed was just south of Columbia s downtown and owned by James S  Rollins  He was later called the  Father of the University   13  As the first public university in the Louisiana Purchase  the school was shaped by Thomas Jefferson s ideas about public education  14  In 1862 the American Civil War forced the university to close for much of the year  15  Residents of Columbia formed a  home guard  militia that became known as the  Fighting Tigers of Columbia   They were given the name for their readiness to protect the city and university  In 1890  the University s newly formed football team took the name the  Tigers  after the Civil War militia  16  Fire at Academic Hall  1892 In 1870 the institution was granted land grant college status under the Morrill Act of 1862  14  The act led to the founding of the Missouri School of Mines and Metallurgy as an off shoot of the main campus in Columbia  It developed as the present day Missouri University of Science  amp  Technology  14  In 1888 the Missouri Agricultural Experiment Station opened  This grew to encompass ten centers and research farms around Missouri  12  By 1890 the university encompassed a normal college  for training of teachers of students through high school   engineering college  arts and science college  school of agriculture and mechanical arts  school of medicine  and school of law  15  On January 9  1892  Academic Hall  the institution s main building  burned in a fire that completely gutted the building  leaving little more standing than six stone Ionic columns  17  Under the administration of Missouri Governor David R  Francis  the university was rebuilt  with additions that shaped the modern institution   edit  1892 present Painting of the Red Campus soon after the construction of Jesse Hall After the fire  some state residents tried to have the university moved further west to Sedalia  but Columbia rallied support to keep it  The columns were retained as a symbol of the historic campus  Today they are surrounded by the Francis Quadrangle  the oldest part of campus  At the southern end of the quad is Academic Hall s replacement  Jesse Hall  named for Richard Jesse  the president of the university at the time of the fire   Built in 1895  Jesse Hall holds many administrative offices and Jesse Auditorium  The buildings surrounding the quad were constructed of red brick  leading to this area becoming known as Red Campus  The area was tied together in planned landscaping and walks in 1910 by George Kessler in a City Beautiful design of the grounds  18  Francis Quadrangle  featuring the columns and Jesse Hall To the east of the quadrangle  later buildings constructed of white limestone in 1913 and 1914 to accommodate the new academic programs became known as the White Campus  In 1908 the world s first journalism school opened at MU  It became notable for its  Missouri Method  of hands on  experience based instruction  It later established an award for  Distinguished Journalism   After World War II  the enrollment at universities around the country grew at an extraordinary pace  and MU was no exception  This was due in part to the G I  Bill  which allowed veterans to attend college with the assistance of the federal government  In April 1923  a black janitor accused of rape  James T  Scott  was lynched to death before his trial took place  19  In the winter of 1935  four graduates of Lincoln University a traditionally black school about 30 miles  48 km  away in Jefferson City were denied admission to MU s graduate school  One of the students  Lloyd L  Gaines  brought his case to the United States Supreme Court  On December 12  1938  in a landmark 6 2 decision  the court ordered the State of Missouri to admit Gaines to MU s law school or provide a facility of equal stature  Gaines disappeared in Chicago on March 19  1939  under suspicious circumstances  The University granted Gaines a posthumous honorary law degree in May 2006  20  Undergraduate divisions were integrated by court order in 1950  when the University was compelled to admit African Americans to courses that were not offered at Lincoln University   edit  Campus Tower of Memorial Union The grounds of the campus are designated a botanical garden by the state of Missouri  As noted above  the academic buildings are classified as two main groups  Red Campus and White Campus  Red Campus is the historical core of mostly brick academic buildings around the landmark columns of the David R  Francis Quadrangle  it includes Jesse Hall and Switzler Hall  In the early 20th century  the College of Agriculture began a period of rapid expansion in which several buildings were constructed to accommodate the growing program and student body  The new buildings  constructed in Neo Gothic style from native Missouri limestone  form the White Campus  Its most notable building is Memorial Union  During the 1990s  Red Campus was extended to the south with the creation of the Carnahan Quadrangle  Hulston Hall of the University of Missouri School of Law  completed in 1988  formed the eastern border of the future quad  The Reynolds Alumni Center was completed in 1992 on the west side of the new quad  It was completed in 2002 with Cornell Hall of the Trulaske College of Business and Tiger Plaza  A fountain and statue make up Tiger Plaza  located on the southern edge of the Carnahan Quadrangle  While the original MU intercollegiate athletic facilities  such as Rollins Field and Rothwell Gymnasium  were located just south of the academic buildings  later expanded facilities were constructed across Stadium Boulevard  where Memorial Stadium opened in 1926  The Hearnes Center was built to the east of the stadium in 1972  In 1994  the university developed the first draft of a master plan for the campus to tie together all of Tiger athletic facilities to the south of Stadium Boulevard and add to its design  Today  the MU Sports Park includes the Mizzou Arena  Taylor Stadium  Walton Stadium  Mizzou Athletics Training Complex  University Field and Devine Pavilion  Student athletic facilities remain in the core area of campus  Rothwell Gymnasium and Brewer Fieldhouse are part of the 283 579

until 1966  From its inception in 1839 until the creation of the University of Missouri System in 1963  the university in Columbia was known simply as the University of Missouri  Upon creation of the system  each university was renamed with its host city  thus  the university in Columbia became the University of Missouri Columbia  In the proceeding decades  colloquial and verbal usage of the generic name in reference to MU continued  There were various attempts to drop Columbia from its name by students  faculty  alumni  and administrators who felt it might cause the university to be perceived as a regional institution  This change was long resisted by the UM System and the other universities on the basis of uniformity and fairness  However  after a renewed effort for  name restoration   the Board of Curators voted unanimously on 29 November 2007 to allow MU to drop Columbia from its name for effectively all public purposes  42  Continued use of the name University of Missouri Columbia is not incorrect but is being phased out by MU  except as required on official internal documents within the UM System  Its use also continues to be advocated by some faculty
