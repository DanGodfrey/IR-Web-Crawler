picture that is not definitively an arthouse or pornographic film  In its original usage  during the Golden Age of Hollywood  the term more precisely identified a film intended for distribution as the less publicized  bottom half of a double feature  Although the U S  production of movies intended as second features largely ceased by the end of the 1950s  the term B movie continued to be used in the broader sense it maintains today  In its post Golden Age usage  there is ambiguity on both sides of the definition  on the one hand  many B movies display a high degree of craft and aesthetic ingenuity  on the other  the primary interest of many inexpensive exploitation films is prurient  In some cases  both may be true  In either usage  most B movies represent a particular genre the Western was a Golden Age B movie staple  while low budget science fiction and horror films became more popular in the 1950s  Early B movies were often part of series in which the star repeatedly played the same character  Almost always shorter than the top billed films they were paired with  many had running times of 70 minutes or less  The term connoted a general perception that B movies were inferior to the more handsomely budgeted headliners  individual B films were often ignored by critics  Latter day B movies still sometimes inspire multiple sequels  but series are less common  As the average running time of top of the line films increased  so did that of B pictures  In its current usage  the term has somewhat contradictory connotations  it may signal an opinion that a certain movie is  a  a genre film with minimal artistic ambitions or  b  a lively  energetic film uninhibited by the constraints imposed on more expensive projects and unburdened by the conventions of putatively  serious  independent film  The term is also now used loosely to refer to some higher budgeted  mainstream films with exploitation style content  usually in genres traditionally associated with the B movie  From their beginnings to the present day  B movies have provided opportunities both for those coming up in the profession and others whose careers are waning  Celebrated filmmakers such as Anthony Mann and Jonathan Demme learned their craft in B movies  They are where actors such as John Wayne and Jack Nicholson first became established  and they have provided work for former A movie actors  such as Vincent Price and Karen Black  Some actors  such as B la Lugosi and Pam Grier  worked in B movies for most of their careers  The term B actor is sometimes used to refer to a performer who finds work primarily or exclusively in B pictures  Contents 1 History 1 1 Roots of the B movie  1920s 1 2 Bs in the Golden Age of Hollywood  1930s 1 3 Bs in the Golden Age of Hollywood

 1920s Main article  B movies  Hollywood Golden Age  Columbia s That Certain Thing  1928  was made for less than  20 000  Soon  director Frank Capra s association with Columbia would help vault the studio toward Hollywood s major leagues  1  It is not clear that the term B movie  or B film or B picture  was in general use before the 1930s  but a similar concept was already well established  In 1927 28  at the end of the silent era  the production cost of an average feature from a major Hollywood studio ranged from  190 000 at Fox to  275 000 at MGM  That average reflected both  specials  that might cost as much as  1 million and films made quickly for around  50 000  These cheaper films allowed the studios to derive maximum value from facilities and contracted staff in between a studio s more important productions  while also breaking in new personnel  2  Studios in the minor leagues of the industry  such as Columbia Pictures and Film Booking Offices of America  FBO   focused on exactly those sort of cheap productions  Their movies  with relatively short running times  targeted theaters that had to economize on rental and operating costs  particularly small town and urban neighborhood venues  or  nabes   Even smaller production houses  known as Poverty Row studios  made films whose costs might run as low as  3 000  seeking a profit through whatever bookings they could pick up in the gaps left by the larger concerns  3  With the widespread arrival of sound film in American theaters in 1929  many independent exhibitors began dropping the then dominant presentation model  which involved live acts and a broad variety of shorts before a single featured film  A new programming scheme developed that would soon become standard practice  a newsreel  a short and or a serial  and a cartoon  followed by a double feature  The second feature  which actually screened before the main event  cost the exhibitor less per minute than the equivalent running time in shorts  The majors   clearance  rules favoring their affiliated theaters prevented the independents  timely access to top quality films  the second feature allowed them to promote quantity instead  4  The additional movie also gave the program  balance  the practice of pairing different sorts of features suggested to potential customers that they could count on something of interest no matter what specifically was on the bill  The low budget picture of the 1920s thus evolved into the second feature  the B movie  of Hollywood s Golden Age  5   edit  Bs in the Golden Age of Hollywood  1930s Main article  B movies  Hollywood Golden Age  The major studios  at first resistant to the double feature  soon adapted  All established B units to provide films for the expanding second feature market  Block booking became standard practice  to get access to a studio s attractive A pictures  many theaters were obliged to rent the company s entire output for a season  With the B films rented at a flat fee  rather than the box office percentage basis of A films   rates could be set virtually guaranteeing the profitability of every B movie  The parallel practice of blind bidding largely freed the majors from worrying about their Bs  quality even when booking in less than seasonal blocks  exhibitors had to buy most pictures sight unseen  The five largest studios Metro Goldwyn Mayer  Paramount Pictures  Fox Film Corporation  20th Century Fox as of 1935   Warner Bros   and RKO Radio Pictures  descendant of FBO  also belonged to companies with sizable theater chains  further securing the bottom line  6  Poverty Row studios  from modest outfits like Mascot Pictures  Tiffany Pictures  and Sono Art World Wide Pictures down to shoestring operations  made exclusively B movies  serials  and other shorts  and also distributed totally independent productions and imported films  In no position to directly block book  they mostly sold regional distribution exclusivity to  states rights  firms  which in turn peddled blocks of movies to exhibitors  typically six or more pictures featuring the same star  a relative status on Poverty Row   7  Two  major minors  Universal Studios and rising Columbia Pictures had production lines roughly similar to  though somewhat better endowed than  the top Poverty Row studios  In contrast to the Big Five majors  Universal and Columbia had few or no theaters  though they did have top rank film distribution exchanges  8  In the standard Golden Age model  the industry s top product  the A films  premiered at a small number of select first run houses in major cities  Double features were not the rule at these prestigious venues  As described by historian Edward Jay Epstein   During these first runs  films got their reviews  garnered publicity  and generated the word of mouth that served as the principal form of advertising   9  Then it was off to the subsequent run market where the double feature prevailed  At the larger local venues controlled by the majors  movies might turn over on a weekly basis  At the thousands of smaller  independent theaters  programs often changed two or three times a week  To meet the constant demand for new B product  the low end of Poverty Row turned out a stream of micro budget movies rarely much more than sixty minutes long  these were known as  quickies  for their tight production schedules as short as four days  10  As Brian Taves describes   Many of the poorest theaters  such as the  grind houses  in the larger cities  screened a continuous program emphasizing action with no specific schedule  sometimes offering six quickies for a nickel in an all night show that changed daily   11  Many small theaters never saw a big studio A film  getting their movies from the states rights concerns that handled almost exclusively Poverty Row product  Millions of Americans went to their local theaters as a matter of course  for an A picture  along with the trailers  or screen previews  that presaged its arrival    t he new film s title on the marquee and the listings for it in the local newspaper constituted all the advertising most movies got   writes Epstein  12  Aside from at the theater itself  B films might not be advertised at all  The introduction of sound had driven costs higher  by 1930  the average U S  feature film cost  375 000 to produce  13  A broad range of motion pictures occupied the B category  The leading studios made not only clear cut A and B films  but also movies classifiable as  programmers   also known as  in betweeners  or  intermediates    As Taves describes   Depending on the prestige of the theater and the other material on the double bill  a programmer could show up at the top or bottom of the marquee   14  On Poverty Row  many Bs were made on budgets that would have barely covered petty cash on a major s A film  with costs at the bottom of the industry running as low as  5 000  10  By the mid 1930s  the double feature was the dominant U S  exhibition model  and the majors responded  In 1935  B movie production at Warner Bros  was raised from 12 to 50 percent of studio output  The unit was headed by Bryan Foy  known as the  Keeper of the Bs   15  At Fox  which also shifted half of its production line into B territory  Sol M  Wurtzel was similarly in charge of more than twenty movies a year during the late 1930s  16  Stony Brooke  Wayne   Tucson Smith  Corrigan   and Lullaby Joslin  Terhune  did not get much time in harness  Republic Pictures  Pals of the Saddle  1938  lasts just 55 minutes  average for a Three Mesquiteers adventure  A number of the top Poverty Row firms consolidated  Sono Art joined another company to create Monogram Pictures early in the decade  In 1935  Monogram  Mascot  and several smaller studios merged to establish Republic Pictures  The former heads of Monogram soon sold off their Republic shares and set up a new Monogram production house  17  Into the 1950s  most Republic and Monogram product was roughly on par with the low end of the majors  output  Less sturdy Poverty Row concerns with a penchant for grand sobriquets like Conquest  Empire  Imperial  and Peerless continued to churn out dirt cheap quickies  18  Joel Finler has analyzed the average length of feature releases in 1938  indicating the studios  relative emphasis on B production 19   United Artists produced little  focusing on the distribution of prestigious films from independent outfits  Grand National  active 1936 40  occupied an analogous niche on Poverty Row  releasing mostly independent productions 20    Studio Category Avg  duration MGM Big Five 87 9 minutes Paramount Big Five 76 4 minutes 20th Century Fox Big Five 75 3 minutes Warner Bros  Big Five 75 0

Poverty Row 63 1 minutes Monogram Poverty Row 60 0 minutes Taves estimates that half of the films produced by the eight majors in the 1930s were B movies  Calculating in the three hundred or so films made annually by the many Poverty Row firms  approximately 75 percent of Hollywood movies from the decade  more than four thousand pictures  are classifiable as Bs  21  The Western was by far the predominant B genre in both the 1930s and  to a lesser degree  the 1940s  22  Film historian Jon Tuska has argued that  the  B  product of the Thirties the Universal films with  Tom  Mix   Ken  Maynard  and  Buck  Jones  the Columbia features with Buck Jones and Tim McCoy  the RKO George O Brien series  the Republic Westerns with John Wayne and the Three Mesquiteers     achieved a uniquely American perfection of the well made story   23  At the far end of the industry  Poverty Row s Ajax put out oaters starring Harry Carey  then in his fifties  The Weiss outfit had the Range Rider series  the American Rough Rider series  and the Morton of the Mounted  northwest action thrillers   24  One low budget oater of the era  made totally outside the studio system  profited from an outrageous concept  a Western with an all midget cast  The Terror of Tiny Town  1938  was such a success in its independent bookings that Columbia picked it up for distribution  25  Series of various genres  featuring recurrent  title worthy characters or name actors in familiar roles  were particularly popular during the first decade of sound film  Fox s many B series  for instance  included Charlie Chan mysteries  Ritz Brothers comedies  and musicals with child star Jane Withers  26  These series films are not to be confused with the short  cliffhanger structured serials that sometimes appeared on the same program  As with serials  however  many series were intended to attract young people a theater that twin billed part time might run a  balanced  or entirely youth oriented double feature as a matinee and then a single film for a more mature audience at night  In the words of one industry report  afternoon moviegoers   composed largely of housewives and children  want quantity for their money while the evening crowds want  something good and not too much of it    27  Series films are often unquestioningly consigned to the B movie category  but even here there is ambiguity  at MGM  for example  popular series like the Andy Hardy chronicles had leading stars and budgets that would have been A level at some of the lesser majors  28  For many series  even a lesser major s standard B budget was far out of reach  Poverty Row s Consolidated Pictures featured Tarzan  the Police Dog in a series with the proud name of Melodramatic Dog Features  29   edit  Bs in the Golden Age of Hollywood  1940s Main article  B movies  Hollywood Golden Age  By 1940  the average production cost of an American feature was  400 000  a negligible increase over ten years  13  A number of small Hollywood companies had folded around the turn of the decade  including the ambitious Grand National  but a new firm  Producers Releasing Corporation  PRC   emerged as third in the Poverty Row hierarchy behind Republic and Monogram  The double feature  never universal  was still the prevailing exhibition model  in 1941  50 percent of theaters were double billing exclusively  and others employed the policy part time  30  In the early 1940s  legal pressure forced the studios to replace seasonal block booking with packages generally limited to five pictures  Restrictions were also placed on the majors  ability to enforce blind bidding  31  These were crucial factors in the progressive shift by most of the Big Five over to A film production  making the smaller studios even more important as B movie suppliers  Genre pictures made at very low cost remained the backbone of Poverty Row  with even Republic s and Monogram s budgets rarely climbing over  200 000  Many smaller Poverty Row firms folded as the eight majors  with their proprietary distribution exchanges  now commanded about 95 percent of U S  and Canadian box office receipts  32  In 1946  independent producer David O  Selznick brought his bloated budget spectacle Duel in the Sun to market with heavy nationwide promotion and wide release  The distribution strategy was a major success  despite what was widely perceived as the movie s poor quality  33  The Duel release anticipated practices that fueled the B movie industry in the late 1950s  when the top Hollywood studios made them standard two decades after that  the B movie would be hard hit  34  Considerations beside cost made the line between A and B movies ambiguous  Films shot on B level budgets were occasionally marketed as A pictures or emerged as sleeper hits  One of 1943 s biggest films was Hitler s Children  an RKO thriller made for a fraction over  200 000  It earned more than  3 million in rentals  industry language for a distributor s share of gross box office receipts  35  Particularly in the realm of film noir  A pictures sometimes echoed visual styles generally associated with cheaper films  Programmers  with their flexible exhibition role  were ambiguous by definition  As late as 1948  the double feature remained a popular exhibition mode it was standard policy at 25 percent of theaters and used part time at an additional 36 percent  36  The leading Poverty Row firms began to broaden their scope  In 1947  Monogram established a subsidiary  Allied Artists  to develop and distribute relatively expensive films  mostly from independent producers  Around the same time  Republic launched a similar effort under the  Premiere  rubric  37  In 1947 as well  PRC was subsumed by Eagle Lion  a British company seeking entry to the American market  Warners  former Keeper of the Bs  Brian Foy  was installed as production chief  38  Often marketed as pure sensationalism  many film noirs also possessed great visual beauty  Raw Deal  1948   writes scholar Robert Smith  is  resplendent with velvety blacks  mists  netting  and other expressive accessories of poetic noir decor and lighting   39  Directed by Anthony Mann and shot by John Alton  it was released by Poverty Row s Eagle Lion firm  In the 1940s  RKO stood out among the industry s Big Five for its focus on B pictures  40  From a latter day perspective  the most famous of the major studios  Golden Age B units is Val Lewton s horror unit at RKO  Lewton produced such moody  mysterious films as Cat People  1942   I Walked with a Zombie  1943   and The Body Snatcher  1945   directed by Jacques Tourneur  Robert Wise  and others who would become renowned only later in their careers or entirely in retrospect  41  The movie now widely described as the first classic film noir Stranger on the Third Floor  1940   a 64 minute B was produced at RKO  which would release many additional melodramatic thrillers in a similarly stylish vein  42  The other major studios also turned out a considerable number of movies now identified as noir during the 1940s  Though many of the best known film noirs were A level productions  most 1940s pictures in the mode were either of the ambiguous programmer type or destined straight for the bottom of the bill  In the decades since  these cheap entertainments  generally dismissed at the time  have become some of the most treasured products of Hollywood s Golden Age  43  In one sample year  1947  RKO produced along with several noir programmers and A pictures  two straight B noirs  Desperate and The Devil Thumbs a Ride  44  Ten B noirs that year came from Poverty Row s big three Republic  Monogram  and PRC Eagle Lion and one came from tiny Screen Guild  Three majors beside RKO contributed a total of five more  Along with these eighteen unambiguous B noirs  an additional dozen or so noir programmers came out of Hollywood  45  Still  most of the majors  low budget production remained the sort now largely ignored  RKO s representative output included the Mexican Spitfire and Lum and Abner comedy series  thrillers featuring the Saint and the Falcon  Westerns starring Tim Holt  and Tarzan movies with Johnny Weissmuller  Jean Hersholt played Dr  Christian in six films between 1939 and 1941  46 The Courageous Dr  Christian  1940  was a standard entry   In the course of an hour or so of screen time  the saintly physician managed to cure an epidemic of spinal meningitis  demonstrate benevolence towards the disenfranchised  set an example for wayward youth  and calm the passions of an amorous old maid   47  Down in Poverty Row  low budgets led to less palliative fare  Republic aspired to major league respectability while making many cheap and modestly budgeted Westerns  but there was not much from the bigger studios that compared with Monogram  exploitation pictures  like juvenile delinquency expos  Where Are Your Children   1943  and the prison film Women in Bondage  1943   48  In 1947  PRC s The Devil on Wheels brought together teenagers  hot rods  and death  The little studio had its own house auteur  with his own crew and relatively free rein  director Edgar G  Ulmer was known as  the Capra of PRC   49  Ulmer made films of every generic stripe  His Girls in Chains was released in May 1943  six months before Women in Bondage  by the end of the year  Ulmer had also made the teen themed musical Jive Junction as well as Isle of Forgotten Sins  a South Seas adventure set around a brothel  50   edit  Transition I The B movie in the television age  1950s Main article  B movies  Transition in the 1950s  In 1948  a Supreme Court ruling in a federal antitrust suit against the majors outlawed block booking and led to the Big Five divesting their theater chains  With audiences draining away to television and studios scaling back production schedules  the classic double feature vanished from many American theaters during the 1950s  The major studios promoted the benefits of recycling  offering former headlining movies as second features in the place of traditional B films  51  With television airing many classic Westerns as well as producing its own original Western series  the cinematic market for B oaters in particular was drying up  After barely inching forward in the 1930s  the average U S  feature production cost had essentially doubled over the 1940s  reaching  1 million by the turn of the decade a 93 percent rise after adjusting for inflation  13  The first prominent victim of the changing market was Eagle Lion  which released its last films in 1951  By 1953  the old Monogram brand had disappeared  the company having adopted the identity of its higher end subsidiary  Allied Artists  The following year  Allied released Hollywood s last B series Westerns  Non series B Westerns continued to appear for a few more years  but Republic Pictures  long associated with cheap sagebrush sagas  was out of the filmmaking business by decade s end  In other genres  Universal kept its Ma and Pa Kettle series going through 1957  while Allied Artists stuck with the Bowery Boys until 1958  52  RKO  weakened by years of mismanagement  exited the movie industry in 1957  53  Hollywood s A product was getting longer the top ten box office releases of 1940 had averaged 112 5 minutes  the average length of 1955 s top ten was 123 4  54  In their modest way  the Bs were following suit  The age of the hour long feature film was past  70 minutes was now roughly the minimum  While the Golden Age style second feature was dying  B movie was still used to refer to any low budget genre film featuring relatively unheralded performers  sometimes referred to as B actors   The term retained its earlier suggestion that such movies relied on formulaic plots   stock  character types  and simplistic action or unsophisticated comedy  55  At the same time  the realm of the B movie was becoming increasingly fertile territory for experimentation  both serious and outlandish  Ida Lupino  well known as an actress  established herself as Hollywood s sole female director of the era  56  In short  low budget pictures made for her production company  The Filmakers  Lupino explored virtually taboo subjects such as rape in 1950 s Outrage and 1953 s self explanatory The Bigamist  57  Her most famous directorial effort  The Hitch Hiker  a 1953 RKO release  is the only example of film noir s classic period directed by a woman  58  That year  RKO put out another historically notable film made at low cost  Split Second  which concludes in a nuclear test range  is perhaps the first  atomic noir   59  The most famous such movie  the independently produced Kiss Me Deadly  1955   typifies the persistently murky middle ground between the A and B picture  as Richard Maltby describes  a  programmer capable of occupying either half of a neighbourhood theatre s double bill   it was  budgeted at approximately  400 000   Its  distributor  United Artists  released around twenty five programmers with production budgets between  100 000 and  400 000 in 1955   60  The film s length  106 minutes  is A level  but its star  Ralph Meeker  had previously appeared in only one major film  Its source is pure pulp  one of Mickey Spillane s Mike Hammer novels  but Robert Aldrich s direction is self consciously aestheticized  The result is a brutal genre picture that also evokes contemporary anxieties about what was often spoken of simply as the Bomb  61  Rocketship X M  1950   produced and released by small Lippert Pictures  is cited as possibly  the first postnuclear holocaust film   62  It was at the leading edge of a large cycle of movies  mostly low budget and many long forgotten  classifiable as  atomic bomb cinema   The fear of nuclear war with the Soviet Union  along with less expressible qualms about radioactive fallout from America s own atomic tests  energized many of the era s genre films  Science fiction  horror  and various hybrids of the two were now of central economic importance to the low budget end of the business  Most down market films of the type like many of those produced by William Alland at Universal  e g   Creature from the Black Lagoon  1954   and Sam Katzman at Columbia  e g   It Came from Beneath the Sea  1955   provided little more than thrills  though their special effects could be impressive  63  But these were genres whose fantastic nature could also be used as cover for mordant cultural observations often difficult to make in mainstream movies  Director Don Siegel s Invasion of the Body Snatchers  1956   released by Allied Artists  treats conformist pressures and the evil of banality in haunting  allegorical fashion  64 The Amazing Colossal Man  1957   directed by Bert I  Gordon  is both a monster movie that happens to depict the horrific effects of radiation exposure and  a ferocious cold war fable  that  spins Korea  the army s obsessive secrecy  and America s post war growth into one fantastic whole   65  The Amazing Colossal Man was released by a new company whose name was much bigger than its budgets  American International Pictures  AIP   founded in 1956 by James H  Nicholson and Samuel Z  Arkoff in a reorganization of their American Releasing Corporation  ARC   soon became the leading U S  studio devoted entirely to B cost productions  American International helped keep the original release double bill alive through paired packages of its films  these movies were low budget  but instead of a flat rate  they were rented out on a percentage basis  like A films  66  The success of I Was a Teenage Werewolf  1957  thus brought AIP a large return made for about  100 000  it grossed more than  2 million  67  As the film s title suggests  the studio relied on both fantastic genre subjects and new  teen oriented angles  When Hot Rod Gang  1958  turned a profit  hot rod horror was given a try  Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow  1959   David Cook credits AIP with leading the way  in demographic exploitation  target marketing  and saturation booking  all of which would become standard procedure for the majors in planning and releasing their mass market  event  films  by the late 1970s  68  In terms of content  the majors were already there  with  J D   movies such as Warner Bros   Untamed Youth  1957  and MGM s High School Confidential  1958   both starring Mamie Van Doren  69  In 1954  a young filmmaker named Roger Corman received his first screen credits as writer and associate producer of Allied Artists  Highway Dragnet  Corman soon independently produced his first movie  Monster from the Ocean Floor  on a  12 000 budget and a six day shooting schedule  70  Among the six films he worked on in 1955  Corman produced and directed the first official ARC release  Apache Woman  and Day the World Ended  half of Arkoff and Nicholson s first twin bill package  Corman would go on to direct over fifty feature films through 1990  As of 2007  he remained active as a producer  with more than 350 movies to his credit  Often referred to as the  King of the Bs   Corman has said that  to my way of thinking  I never made a  B  movie in my life   as the traditional B movie was dying out when he began making pictures  He prefers to describe his metier as  low budget exploitation films   71  In later years Corman  both with AIP and as head of his own companies  would help launch the careers of Francis Ford Coppola  Jonathan Demme  Robert Towne  and Robert De Niro  among many others  72  In the late 1950s  William Castle became known as the great innovator of the B movie publicity gimmick  Audiences of Macabre  1958   an  86 000 production distributed by Allied Artists  were invited to take out insurance policies to cover potential death from fright  The 1959 creature feature The Tingler featured Castle s most famous gimmick  Percepto  at the film s climax  buzzers attached to select theater seats would unexpectedly rattle a few audience members  prompting either appropriate screams or even more appropriate laughter  73  With such films  Castle  combine d  the saturation advertising campaign perfected by Columbia and Universal in their Sam Katzman and William Alland packages with centralized and standardized publicity stunts and gimmicks that had previously been the purview of the local exhibitor   74  The postwar drive in theater boom was vital to the expanding independent B movie industry  In January 1945  there were 96 drive ins in the United States  a decade later  there were more than 3 700  75  Unpretentious pictures with simple  familiar plots and reliable shock effects were ideally suited for auto based film viewing  with all its attendant distractions  The phenomenon of the drive in movie became one of the defining symbols of American popular culture in the 1950s  At the same time  many local television stations began showing B genre films in late night slots  popularizing the notion of the midnight movie  76  Increasingly  American made genre films were joined by foreign movies acquired at low cost and  where necessary  dubbed for the U S  market  In 1956  distributor Joseph E  Levine financed the shooting of new footage with American actor Raymond Burr that was edited into the Japanese sci fi horror film Godzilla  77  The British Hammer Film Productions made the successful The Curse of Frankenstein  1957  and Dracula  1958   major influences on future horror film style  In 1959  Levine s Embassy Pictures bought the worldwide rights to Hercules  a cheaply made Italian movie starring American born bodybuilder Steve Reeves  On top of a  125 000 purchase price  Levine then spent  1 5 million on advertising and publicity  a virtually unprecedented amount  78 The New York Times was nonplussed  claiming that the movie would have drawn  little more than yawns in the film market     had it not been  launched  throughout the country with a deafening barrage of publicity   79  Levine counted on first weekend box office for his profits  booking the film  into as many cinemas as he could for a week s run  then withdrawing it before poor word of mouth withdrew it for him   80 Hercules opened at a remarkable 600 theaters  and the strategy was a smashing success  the film earned  4 7 million in domestic rentals  Just as valuable to the bottom line  it was even more successful overseas  78  Within a few decades  Hollywood would be dominated by both movies and an exploitation philosophy very like Levine s   edit  Golden age of exploitation  1960s Main article  B movies  The exploitation boom  Despite all the transformations in the industry  by 1961 the average production cost of an American feature film was still only  2 million after adjusting for inflation  less than 10 percent more than it had been in 1950  13  The traditional twin bill of B film preceding and balancing a subsequent run A film had largely disappeared from American theaters  The AIP style dual genre package was the new model  In July 1960  the latest Joseph E  Levine sword and sandals import  Hercules Unchained  opened at neighborhood theaters in New York  A suspense film  Terror Is a Man  ran as a  co feature  with a now familiar sort of exploitation gimmick   The d nouement helpfully includes a  warning bell  so the sensitive can  close their eyes    81  That year  Roger Corman took AIP down a new road   When they asked me to make two ten day black and white horror films to play as a double feature  I convinced them instead to finance one horror film in color   82  The resulting House of Usher typifies the continuing ambiguities of B picture classification  It was clearly an A film by the standards of both director and studio  with the longest shooting schedule and biggest budget Corman had ever enjoyed  But it is generally seen as a B movie  the schedule was still a mere fifteen days  the budget just  200 000  one tenth the industry average   83  and its 85 minute running time close to an old thumbnail definition of the B   Any movie that runs less than 80 minutes   84  With the loosening of industry censorship constraints  the 1960s saw a major expansion in the commercial viability of a variety of B movie subgenres that became known collectively as exploitation films  The combination of intensive and gimmick laden publicity with movies featuring vulgar subject matter and often outrageous imagery dated back decades the term had originally defined truly fringe productions  made at the lowest depths of Poverty Row or entirely outside the Hollywood system  Many graphically depicted the wages of sin in the context of promoting prudent lifestyle choices  particularly  sexual hygiene   Audiences might see explicit footage of anything from a live birth to a ritual circumcision  85  Such films were not generally booked as part of movie theaters  regular schedules but rather presented as special events by traveling roadshow promoters  they might also appear as fodder for  grindhouses   which typically had no regular schedule at all   The most famous of those promoters  Kroger Babb  was in the vanguard of marketing low budget  sensationalistic films with a  100  saturation campaign   inundating the target audience with ads in almost any imaginable medium  86  In the era of the traditional double feature  no one would have characterized these graphic exploitation films as  B movies   With the majors having exited traditional B production and exploitation style promotion becoming standard practice at the lower end of the industry   exploitation  became a way to refer to the entire field of low budget genre films  87  The 1960s would see exploitation style themes and imagery become increasingly central to the realm of the B  Motorpsycho  1965  was not hard to market  It had director Russ Meyer s reputation for eroticism  the biker theme   MURDERcycles   that would soon prove its popularity in historic fashion  and that trendy title word psycho  Exploitation movies in the original sense continued to appear  1961 s Damaged Goods  a cautionary tale about a young lady whose boyfriend s promiscuity leads to venereal disease  comes complete with enormous  grotesque closeups of VD s physical effects  88  At the same time  the concept of fringe exploitation was merging with a related  similarly venerable tradition   nudie  films featuring nudist camp footage or striptease artists like Bettie Page had simply been the softcore pornography of previous decades  As far back as 1933  This Nude World was  Guaranteed the Most Educational Film Ever Produced   89  In the late 1950s  as more of the old grindhouse theaters devoted themselves specifically to  adult  product  a few filmmakers began making nudies with greater attention to plot  Best known was Russ Meyer  who released his first successful narrative nudie  the comic Immoral Mr  Teas  in 1959  Five years later  Meyer came out with his breakthrough film  Lorna  which combined sex  violence  and a dramatic storyline  90 Faster  Pussycat  Kill  Kill   1965   made for about  45 000  would ultimately become the most famous of Meyer s so called sexploitation pictures  Crafted for constant titillation but containing no nudity  it was aimed at the same  passion pit  drive in circuit that screened AIP teen movies with wink wink titles like Beach Blanket Bingo  1965  and How to Stuff a Wild Bikini  1966   starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon  91  Roger Corman s The Trip  1967  for American International  written by veteran AIP Corman actor Jack Nicholson  never shows a fully bared  unpainted breast  but flirts with nudity throughout  92  The Meyer and Corman lines were drawing closer  One of the most influential films of the era  on Bs and beyond  was Paramount s Psycho  Its  8 5 million in earnings against a production cost of  800 000 made it the most profitable movie of 1960  93  Its mainstream distribution without the Production Code seal of approval helped weaken U S  film censorship  And  as William Paul notes  this move into the horror genre by respected director Alfred Hitchcock was made   significantly  with the lowest budgeted film of his American career and the least glamorous stars   Its  greatest initial impact     was on schlock horror movies  notably those from second tier director William Castle   each of which tried to bill itself as scarier than Psycho   94  Castle s first film in the Psycho vein was Homicidal  1961   an early step in the development of the slasher subgenre that would take off in the late 1970s  93 Blood Feast  1963   a movie about human dismemberment and culinary preparation made for approximately  24 000 by experienced nudie maker Herschell Gordon Lewis  established a new  more immediately successful subgenre  the gore or splatter film  Lewis s business partner David F  Friedman drummed up publicity by distributing vomit bags to theatergoers the sort of gimmick Castle had mastered and arranging for an injunction against the film in Sarasota  Florida the sort of problem exploitation films had long run up against  except Friedman had planned it  95  This new breed of gross out movie typified the emerging sense of  exploitation  the progressive adoption of traditional exploitation and nudie elements into horror  into other classic B genres  and into the low budget film industry as a whole  Imports of Hammer Film s increasingly explicit horror movies and Italian gialli  highly stylized pictures mixing sexploitation and ultraviolence  would fuel this trend  96  The Production Code was officially scrapped in 1968  to be replaced by the first version of the modern rating system  97  That year  two horror films came out that heralded directions American cinema would take in the next decade  with major consequences for the B movie  One was a high budget Paramount production  directed by the celebrated Roman Polanski  Produced by B horror veteran William Castle  Rosemary s Baby was the first upscale Hollywood picture in the genre in three decades  98  It was a critical success and the year s seventh biggest hit  99  The other was George A  Romero s Night of the Living Dead  produced on weekends in and around Pittsburgh for  114 000  Building on the achievement of B genre predecessors like Invasion of the Body Snatchers in its subtextual exploration of social and political issues  it doubled as a highly effective thriller and an incisive allegory for both the Vietnam War and domestic racial conflicts  Its greatest influence  though  derived from its clever subversion of genre clich s and the connection made between its exploitation style imagery  low cost  truly independent means of production  and high profitability  100  With the Code gone and the X rating established  major studio A films like Midnight Cowboy could now show  adult  imagery  while the market for increasingly hardcore pornography exploded  In this transformed commercial context  work like Russ Meyer s gained a new legitimacy  In 1969  for the first time a Meyer film  Finders Keepers  Lovers Weepers   was reviewed in The New York Times  101  Soon  Corman would be putting out nudity filled sexploitation pictures such as Private Duty Nurses  1971  and Women in Cages  1971   102  In May 1969  the most important exploitation movie of the era premiered at the Cannes Film Festival  103  Much of Easy Rider s significance owes to the fact that it was produced for a respectable  if still modest  budget and released by a major studio  The project was first taken by one of its cocreators  Peter Fonda  to American International  Fonda had become AIP s top star in the Corman directed The Wild Angels  1966   a biker movie  and The Trip  as in LSD  The idea Fonda pitched would combine those two proven themes  AIP was intrigued but balked at giving his collaborator  Dennis Hopper  also a studio alumnus  free directorial rein  Eventually they arranged a financing and distribution deal with Columbia  as two more graduates of the Corman AIP exploitation mill joined the project  Jack Nicholson and cinematographer L szl  Kov cs  104  The film  which incorporated another favorite exploitation theme  the redneck menace  as well as a fair amount of nudity  was brought in at a cost of  501 000  It earned  19 1 million in rentals  105  In the words of historians Seth Cagin and Philip Dray  Easy Rider became  the seminal film that provided the bridge between all the repressed tendencies represented by schlock kitsch hack since the dawn of Hollywood and the mainstream cinema of the seventies   106   edit  Golden age of exploitation  1970s Main articles  B movies  The exploitation boom  and Midnight movie In the late 1960s and early 1970s  a new generation of low budget film companies emerged that drew from all the different lines of exploitation as well as the sci fi and teen themes that had been a mainstay since the 1950s  Operations such as Roger Corman s New World Pictures  Cannon Films  and New Line Cinema brought exploitation films to mainstream theaters around the country  The major studios  top product was continuing to inflate in running time in 1970  the ten biggest earners averaged 140 1 minutes  107  The Bs were keeping pace  In 1955  Corman had a producorial hand in five movies averaging 74 8 minutes  He played a similar part in five films originally released in 1970  two for AIP and three for his own New World  the average length was 89 8 minutes  108  These films could turn a tidy profit  The first New World release  the biker movie Angels Die Hard  cost  117 000 to produce and took in more than  2 million at the box office  109  The biggest studio in the low budget field remained a leader in exploitation s growth  In 1973  American International gave a shot to young director Brian De Palma  Reviewing Sisters  Pauline Kael observed that its  limp technique doesn t seem to matter to the people who want their gratuitous gore       H e can t get two people talking in order to make a simple expository point without its sounding like the drabbest Republic picture of 1938   110  Many examples of the so called blaxploitation genre  featuring stereotype filled stories revolving around drugs  violent crime  and prostitution  were the product of AIP  One of blaxploitation s biggest stars was Pam Grier  who began her film career with a bit part in Russ Meyer s Beyond the Valley of the Dolls  1970   Several New World pictures followed  including The Big Doll House  1971  and The Big Bird Cage  1972   both directed by Jack Hill  Hill also directed her best known performances  in two AIP blaxploitation films  Coffy  1973  and Foxy Brown  1974   111  Blaxploitation was the first exploitation genre in which the major studios were central  Indeed  the United Artists release Cotton Comes to Harlem  1970   directed by Ossie Davis  is seen as the first significant film of the type  112  But the movie that truly ignited the blaxploitation phenomenon was completely independent  Sweet Sweetback s Baadasssss Song  1971  is also perhaps the most outrageous example of the form  wildly experimental  borderline pornographic  and essentially a manifesto for a black American revolution  113 Melvin Van Peebles wrote  co produced  directed  starred in  edited  and composed the music for the film  which was completed with a loan from Bill Cosby  114  Its distributor was small Cinemation Industries  then best known for releasing dubbed versions of the Italian Mondo Cane  shockumentaries  and the Swedish skin flick Fanny Hill  as well as for its one in house production  The Man from O R G Y   1970   115  These sorts of films played in the  grindhouses  of the day many of them not outright porno theaters  but rather venues for all manner of exploitation cinema  The days of six quickies for a nickel were gone  but a continuity of spirit was evident  116  Piranha  1978   directed by Joe Dante and written by John Sayles for Corman s New World Pictures  is an action filled creature feature  an environmentalist cautionary tale  and a humorous parody of Jaws  It was one of many exploitation films to mimic the design of Jaws  famous poster   with its promise of titillating thrills   117  In 1970  a low budget crime drama shot in 16 mm by first time American director Barbara Loden won the international critics  prize at the Venice Film Festival  118 Wanda is both a seminal event in the independent film movement and a classic B picture  The crime based plot and often seedy settings would have suited a straightforward exploitation film or an old school B noir  The  115 000 production  118  for which Loden spent six years raising money  was praised by Vincent Canby for  the absolute accuracy of its effects  the decency of its point of view and     purity of technique   119  Like Romero and Van Peebles  other filmmakers of the era made pictures that combined the gut level entertainment of exploitation with biting social commentary  The first three features directed by Larry Cohen  Bone  1972   Black Caesar  1973   and Hell Up in Harlem  1973   were all nominally blaxploitation movies  but Cohen used them as vehicles for a satirical examination of race relations and the wages of dog eat dog capitalism  120  The gory horror film Deathdream  1974   directed by Bob Clark  is also an agonized protest of the war in Vietnam  121  Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg made serious minded low budget horror films whose implications are not so much ideological as psychological and existential  Shivers  1975   Rabid  1977   The Brood  1979   122  An Easy Rider with conceptual rigor  the movie that most clearly presaged the way in which exploitation content and artistic treatment would be combined in modestly budgeted films of later years was United Artists  biker themed Electra Glide in Blue  1973   directed by James William Guercio  123 The New York Times reviewer thought little of it   Under different intentions  it might have made a decent grade C Roger Corman bike movie though Corman has generally used more interesting directors than Guercio   124  In the early 1970s  the growing practice of screening nonmainstream motion pictures as late shows  with the goal of building a cult film audience  brought the midnight movie concept home to the cinema  now in a countercultural setting something like a drive in movie for the hip  125  One of the first films adopted by the new circuit in 1971 was the three year old Night of the Living Dead  The midnight movie success of low budget pictures made entirely outside of the studio system  like John Waters s Pink Flamingos  1972   with its campy spin on exploitation  spurred the development of the independent film movement  126 The Rocky Horror Picture Show  1975   an inexpensive film from 20th Century Fox that spoofed all manner of classic B picture clich s  became an unparalleled hit when it was relaunched as a late show feature the year after its initial  unprofitable release  Even as Rocky Horror generated its own subcultural phenomenon  it contributed to the mainstreaming of the theatrical midnight movie  127  Asian martial arts films began appearing as imports regularly during the 1970s  These  kung fu  films as they were often called  whatever martial art they featured  were popularized in the United States by the Hong Kong produced movies of Bruce Lee and marketed to the same audience targeted by AIP and New World  128  Horror continued to attract young  independent American directors  As Roger Ebert explained in one 1974 review   Horror and exploitation films almost always turn a profit if they re brought in at the right price  So they provide a good starting place for ambitious would be filmmakers who can t get more conventional projects off the ground   129  The movie under consideration was The Texas Chain Saw Massacre  Made by Tobe Hooper for less than  300 000  it became one of the most influential horror films of the 1970s  130 John Carpenter s Halloween  1978   produced on a  320 000 budget  grossed over  80 million worldwide and effectively established the slasher flick as horror s primary mode for the next decade  Just as Hooper had learned from Romero s work  Halloween  in turn  largely followed the model of Black Christmas  1974   directed by Deathdream s Bob Clark  131  On television  the parallels between the weekly series that became the mainstay of prime time programming and the Hollywood series films of an earlier day had long been clear  132  In the 1970s  original feature length programming increasingly began to echo the B movie as well  As production of TV movies expanded with the introduction of the ABC Movie of the Week in 1969  soon followed by the dedication of other network slots to original features  time and financial factors shifted the medium progressively into B picture territory  Television films inspired by recent scandals such as The Ordeal of Patty Hearst  which premiered a month after her release from prison in 1979 harkened all the way back to the 1920s and such movies as Human Wreckage and When Love Grows Cold  FBO pictures made swiftly in the wake of celebrity misfortunes  133  Many 1970s TV films such as The California Kid  1974   starring Martin Sheen were action oriented genre pictures of a type familiar from contemporary cinematic B production  Nightmare in Badham County  1976  headed straight into the realm of road tripping girls in redneck bondage exploitation  134  The reverberations of Easy Rider could be felt in such pictures  as well as in a host of theatrical exploitation films  But its greatest influence on the fate of the B movie was less direct by 1973  the major studios were catching on to the commercial potential of genres once largely consigned to the bargain basement  Rosemary s Baby had been a big hit  but it had little in common with the exploitation style  Warner Bros   The Exorcist demonstrated that a heavily promoted horror film could be an absolute blockbuster  it was the biggest movie of the year and by far the highest earning horror movie yet made  In William Paul s description  it is also  the film that really established gross out as a mode of expression for mainstream cinema       P ast exploitation films managed to exploit their cruelties by virtue of their marginality  The Exorcist made cruelty respectable  By the end of the decade  the exploitation booking strategy of opening films simultaneously in hundreds to thousands of theaters became standard industry practice   135  Writer director George Lucas s American Graffiti  a Universal production  did something similar  Described by Paul as  essentially an American International teenybopper pic with a lot more spit and polish   it was 1973 s third biggest film and  likewise  by far the highest earning teen themed movie yet made  136  Even more historically significant movies with B themes and A level financial backing would follow in their wake   edit  Decline of the B  1980s Main article  B movies  1980s to the present  Most of the B movie production houses founded during the exploitation era collapsed or were subsumed by larger companies as the field s financial situation changed in the early 1980s  Even a comparatively cheap  efficiently made genre picture intended for theatrical release began to cost millions of dollars  as the major movie studios steadily moved into the production of expensive genre movies  raising audience expectations for spectacular action sequences and realistic special effects  137  Intimations of the trend were evident as early as Airport  1970  and especially in the mega schlock of The Poseidon Adventure  1972   Earthquake  1973   and The Towering Inferno  1974   Their disaster plots and dialogue were B grade at best  from an industry perspective  however  these were pictures firmly rooted in a tradition of star stuffed extravaganzas  The Exorcist had demonstrated the drawing power of big budget  effects laden horror  But the tidal shift in the majors  focus owed largely to the enormous success of three films  Steven Spielberg s creature feature Jaws  1975  and George Lucas s space opera Star Wars  1977  had each  in turn  become the highest grossing film in motion picture history  Superman  released in December 1978  had proved that a studio could spend  55 million on a movie about a children s comic book character and turn a big profit it was the top box office hit of 1979  138  Blockbuster fantasy spectacles like the original 1933 King Kong had once been exceptional  in the new Hollywood  increasingly under the sway of multi industrial conglomerates  they would rule  139   Too gory to be an art film  too arty to be an exploitation film  funny but not quite a comedy   168 private investors backed Blood Simple s  1 5 million budget  140  Brothers Joel and Ethan Coen brought a striking visual style to the 1984 noir  In one repeated motif  writes David Denby   automobile headlights threaten people doing surreptitious things in the dark   141  It had taken a decade and half  from 1961 to 1976  for the production cost of the average Hollywood feature to double from  2 million to  4 million a decline if adjusted for inflation  In just four years it more than doubled again  hitting  8 5 million in 1980  a constant dollar increase of about 25 percent   Even as the U S  inflation rate eased  the average expense of moviemaking would continue to soar  142  With the majors now routinely saturation booking in over a thousand theaters  it was becoming increasingly difficult for smaller outfits to secure the exhibition commitments needed to turn a profit  Double features were now literally history almost impossible to find except at revival houses  One of the first leading casualties of the new economic regime was venerable B studio Allied Artists  which declared bankruptcy in April 1979  143  In the late 1970s  AIP had turned to producing relatively expensive films like the very successful Amityville Horror and the disastrous Meteor in 1979  The studio was sold off and dissolved as a moviemaking concern by the end of 1980  144  Despite the mounting financial pressures  distribution obstacles  and overall risk  many genre movies from small studios and independent filmmakers were still reaching theaters  Horror was the strongest low budget genre of the time  particularly in the slasher mode as with The Slumber Party Massacre  1982   written by feminist author Rita Mae Brown  The film was produced for New World on a budget of  250 000  145  At the beginning of 1983  Corman sold New World  New Horizons  later Concorde New Horizons  became his primary company  In 1984  New Horizons released a critically applauded movie set amid the punk scene written and directed by Penelope Spheeris  The New York Times review concluded   Suburbia is a good genre film   146  Larry Cohen continued to twist genre conventions in pictures such as Q  aka Q  The Winged Serpent  1982   described by critic Chris Petit as  the kind of movie that used to be indispensable to the market  an imaginative  popular  low budget picture that makes the most of its limited resources  and in which people get on with the job instead of standing around talking about it   147  In 1981  New Line put out Polyester  a John Waters movie with a small budget and an old school exploitation gimmick  Odorama  That October The Book of the Dead  a gore filled yet stylish horror movie made for less than  400 000  debuted in Detroit  148  Its writer  director  and co executive producer  Sam Raimi  was a week shy of his twenty second birthday  star and co executive producer Bruce Campbell was twenty three  It was picked up for distribution by New Line  retitled The Evil Dead  and became a hit  In the words of one newspaper critic  it was a  shoestring tour de force   149  One of the most successful 1980s B studios was a survivor from the heyday of the exploitation era  Troma Pictures  founded in 1974  Troma s most characteristic productions  including Class of Nuke  Em High  1986   Redneck Zombies  1986   and Surf Nazis Must Die  1987   take exploitation for an absurdist spin  Troma s best known production is The Toxic Avenger  1985   its hideous hero  affectionately known as Toxie  was featured in several sequels and a TV cartoon series  150  One of the few successful B studio startups of the decade was Rome based Empire Pictures  whose first production  Ghoulies  reached theaters in 1985  The video rental market was becoming central to B film economics  Empire s financial model relied on seeing a profit not from theatrical rentals  but only later  at the video store  151  A number of Concorde New Horizon releases went this route as well  appearing only briefly in theaters  if at all  The growth of the cable television industry also helped support the low budget film industry  as many B movies quickly wound up as  filler  material for 24 hour cable channels or were made expressly for that purpose  152   edit  Decline of the B  1990s Main article  B movies  1980s to the present  By 1990  the cost of the average U S  film had passed  25 million  153  Of the nine films released that year to gross more than  100 million at the U S  box office  two would have been strictly B movie material before the late 1970s  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Dick Tracy  Three more the science fiction thriller Total Recall  the action filled detective thriller Die Hard 2  and the year s biggest hit  the slapstick kiddie comedy Home Alone were also far closer to the traditional arena of the Bs than to classic A list subject matter  154  The growing popularity of home video and access to unedited movies on cable and satellite television along with real estate pressures were making survival more difficult for the sort of small or non chain theaters that were the primary home of independently produced genre films  155  Drive in screens were rapidly disappearing from the American landscape  156  Surviving B movie operations adapted in different ways  Releases from Troma now frequently went straight to video  New Line  in its first decade  had been almost exclusively a distributor of low budget independent and foreign genre pictures  With the smash success of exploitation veteran Wes Craven s original Nightmare on Elm Street  1984   whose nearly  2 million cost it had directly backed  the company began moving steadily into higher budget genre productions  In 1994  New Line was sold to the Turner Broadcasting System  it was soon being run as a midsized studio with a broad range of product alongside Warner Bros  within the Time Warner conglomerate  157  The following year  Showtime launched Roger Corman Presents  a series of thirteen straight to cable movies produced by Concorde New Horizons  A New York Times reviewer found that the initial installment qualified as  vintage Corman     spiked with everything from bared female breasts to a mind blowing quote from Thomas Mann s Death in Venice   158  At the same time as exhibition venues for B films vanished  the independent film movement was burgeoning  among the results were various crossovers between the low budget genre movie and the  sophisticated  arthouse picture  Director Abel Ferrara  who built a reputation with violent B movies such as The Driller Killer  1979  and Ms  45  1981   made two works in the early nineties that marry exploitation worthy depictions of sex  drugs  and general sleaze to complex examinations of honor and redemption  King of New York  1990  was backed by a group of mostly small production companies and the cost of Bad Lieutenant  1992    1 8 million  was financed totally independently  159 Larry Fessenden s micro budget monster movies  such as No Telling  1991  and Habit  1997   reframe classic genre subjects Frankenstein and vampirism  respectively to explore issues of contemporary relevance  160  The budget of David Cronenberg s Crash  1996    10 million  was not comfortably A grade  but it was hardly B level either  The film s imagery was another matter   On its scandalizing surface  David Cronenberg s Crash suggests exploitation at its most disturbingly sick   wrote critic Janet Maslin  161  Financed  like King of New York  by a consortium of production companies  it was picked up for U S  distribution by Fine Line Features  This result mirrored the film s scrambling of definitions  Fine Line was a subsidiary of New Line  recently merged into the Time Warner empire specifically  it was the old exploitation distributor s arthouse division  162 Pulp Fiction  1994   directed by Quentin Tarantino on a  8 5 million budget  became a hugely influential hit by crossing multiple lines  as James Mottram describes   With its art house narrative structure  B movie subject matter and Hollywood cast  the film is the axis for three distinct cinematic traditions to intersect   163   edit  Transition II The B movie in the digital age  2000s Main article  B movies  1980s to the present  By the turn of the millennium  the average production cost of an American feature had already spent three years above the  50 million mark  153  In 2005  the top ten movies at the U S  box office included three adaptations of children s fantasy novels  including one extending and another initiating a series   a child targeted cartoon  a comic book adaptation  a sci fi series installment  a sci fi remake  and a King Kong remake  164  It was a slow year for Corman  he produced just one movie  which had no American theatrical release  true of most of the pictures he had been involved in over the preceding decade  165  As big budget Hollywood movies further usurped traditional low rent genres  the ongoing viability of the familiar brand of B movie was in grave doubt  New York Times critic A  O  Scott warned of the impending  extinction  of  the cheesy  campy  guilty pleasures  of the B picture  as  the schlock of the past has evolved into star driven  heavily publicized  expensive mediocrities   166  B movies are not necessarily  schlock   Shane Carruth made the sophisticated science fiction film Primer  2004  for  7 000  According to critic Adam Lemke  Carruth s  cramped  claustrophobic mise en scene  exemplifies a  subtle yet austere visual style that never succumbs to the restrictions of his limited budget   167  On the other hand  recent industry trends suggest the reemergence of something like the traditional A B split in major studio production  though with fewer  programmers  bridging the gap  According to a 2006 report by industry analyst Alfonso Marone   The average budget for a Hollywood movie is currently around  60 m  rising to  100 m when the cost of marketing for domestic launch  USA only  is factored into the equation  However  we are now witnessing a polarisation of film budgets into two tiers  large productions   120 150 m  and niche features   5 20m       Fewer  30 70 m releases are expected   168  Fox launched a new subsidiary in 2006  Fox Atomic  to concentrate on teen oriented genre films  The economic model was deliberately low rent  at least by major studio standards  According to a Variety report   Fox Atomic is staying at or below the  10 million mark for many of its movies  It s also encouraging filmmakers to shoot digitally a cheaper process that results in a grittier  teen friendly look  And forget about stars  Of Atomic s nine announced films  not one has a big name   169  The newfangled B movie division was shut down in 2009  170  As the Variety report suggests  recent technological advances greatly facilitate the production of truly low budget motion pictures  Although there have always been economical means with which to shoot movies  including Super 8 and 16 mm film  as well as video cameras recording onto analog videotape  these mediums could not rival the image quality of 35 mm film  The development of digital cameras and postproduction methods now allow even low budget filmmakers to produce films with excellent  and not necessarily  grittier   image quality and editing effects  As Marone observes   the equipment budget  camera  support  required for shooting digital is approximately 1 10 that for film  significantly lowering the production budget for independent features  At the same time   since the early 2000s   the quality of digital filmmaking has improved dramatically   168  Independent filmmakers  whether working in a genre or arthouse mode  continue to find it difficult to gain access to distribution channels  though so called digital end to end methods of distribution offer new opportunities  In a similar way  Internet sites such as YouTube have opened up entirely new avenues for the presentation of low budget motion pictures  171   edit  Associated terms The terms C movie and the more common Z movie describe progressively lower grades of the B movie category  The terms drive in movie and midnight movie  which emerged in association with specific historical phenomena  are now often used as synonyms for B movie  A more recently coined synonym is psychotronic movie   edit  C movie The C movie is the grade of motion picture at the low end of the B movie  or in some taxonomies simply below it  172  In the 1980s  with the growth of cable television  the C grade began to be applied with increasing frequency to low quality genre films used as filler programming for that market  The  C  in the term then does double duty  referring not only to quality that is lower than  B  but also to the initial c of cable  Helping to popularize the notion of the C movie was the TV series Mystery Science Theater 3000  1988 99   which ran on national cable channels  first Comedy Central  then the Sci Fi Channel  after its first year  Updating a concept introduced by TV hostess Vampira over three decades before  MST3K presented cheap  low grade movies  primarily science fiction of the 1950s and 1960s  along with running voiceover commentary highlighting the films  shortcomings  Director Ed Wood has been called  the master of the  C movie   in this sense  although Z movie  see below  is perhaps even more applicable to his work  173  The rapid expansion of niche cable and satellite outlets such as Sci Fi  with its Sci Fi Pictures  and HBO s genre channels in the 1990s and 2000s has meant an ongoing market for contemporary C pictures  many of them  direct to cable  movies modestly budgeted genre films never released in theaters  174  Often called  the worst film ever made   Ed Wood s ultra low budget Plan 9 from Outer Space  1959  has become the most famous of all Z movies   edit  Z movie Main article  Z movie The term Z movie  or grade Z movie  is used by some to characterize low budget pictures with quality standards well below those of most B and even so called C movies  Most films referred to as Z movies are made on very small budgets by operations on the fringes of the commercial film industry  The micro budget  quickies  of 1930s fly by night Poverty Row production houses may be thought of as Z movies avant la lettre  175  The films of director Ed Wood  such as Glen or Glenda  1953  and Plan 9 from Outer Space  1959  frequently cited as one of the worst pictures ever made exemplify the classic grade Z movie  Latter day Zs are often characterized by violent  gory  and or sexual content and a minimum of artistic interest  much of this product is destined for the subscription TV equivalent of the grindhouse  176   edit  Psychotronic movie Psychotronic movie is a term coined by film critic Michael J  Weldon referred to by a fellow critic as  the historian of marginal movies  to denote the sort of low budget genre pictures that are generally disdained or ignored entirely by the critical establishment  177  Weldon s immediate source for the term was the Chicago cult film The Psychotronic Man  1980   whose titular character is a barber who develops the ability to kill using psychic energy  According to Weldon   My original idea with that word is that it s a two part word   Psycho  stands for the horror movies  and  tronic  stands for the science fiction movies  I very quickly expanded the meaning of the word to include any kind of exploitation or B movie   178  The term  popularized beginning in the 1980s with publications of Weldon s such as The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film and Psychotronic Video magazine  has subsequently been adopted by other critics and fans  Use of the term tends to emphasize a focus on and affection for those B movies that lend themselves to appreciation as camp  179   edit  References   Hirschhorn  1999   pp  9 10  17    Finler  2003   pp  41 42  Balio  2003   p  29    See  e g   Taves  1995   p  320    Balio  1995   p  29  See also
