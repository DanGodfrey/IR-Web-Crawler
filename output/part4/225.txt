Watauga Association  a 1772 frontier pact generally regarded as the first constitutional government west of the Appalachians  6  What is now Tennessee was initially part of North Carolina  and later part of the Southwest Territory  Tennessee was admitted to the Union as the 16th state on June 1  1796  Tennessee was the last state to leave the Union and join the Confederacy at the outbreak of the U S  Civil War in 1861  and the first state to be readmitted to the Union at the end of the war  7  Tennessee furnished more soldiers for the Confederate Army than any other state  and more soldiers for the Union Army than any other Southern state  7  Tennessee has seen some of the nation s worst racial strife  from the formation of the Ku Klux Klan in Pulaski in 1866 to the assassination of Martin Luther King in Memphis in 1968  In the 20th century  Tennessee transitioned from an agrarian economy to a more diversified economy  aided at times by federal entities such as the Tennessee Valley Authority  In the early 1940s  Oak Ridge  Tennessee was established to house the Manhattan Project s uranium enrichment facilities  helping to build the world s first atomic bomb  Tennessee has played a critical role in the development of rock and roll and early blues music  Beale Street in Memphis is considered by many to be the birthplace of the blues  with musicians such as W C  Handy performing in its clubs as early as 1909  8  Memphis was also home to Sun Records  where musicians such as Elvis Presley  Johnny Cash  Carl Perkins  Jerry Lee Lewis  Roy Orbison  and Charlie Rich began their recording careers  and where rock and roll took shape in the 1950s  9  The 1927 Victor recording sessions in Bristol generally mark the beginning of the country music genre  10  and the rise of the Grand Ole Opry in the 1930s helped make Nashville the center of the country music recording industry  11  Tennessee s major industries include agriculture  manufacturing  and tourism  Poultry  soybeans  and cattle are the state s primary agricultural products  12  and major manufacturing exports include chemicals  transportation equipment  and electrical equipment  13  The Great

Carolina to the east  Georgia  Alabama and Mississippi on the south  Arkansas and Missouri on the Mississippi River to the west  Tennessee ties Missouri as the state bordering the most other states  The state is trisected by the Tennessee River  The highest point in the state is Clingmans Dome at 6 643 feet  2 025 m   15  Clingmans Dome  which lies on Tennessee s eastern border  is the highest point on the Appalachian Trail  The state line between Tennessee and North Carolina crosses the summit  The lowest point is the Mississippi River at the Mississippi state line  The geographical center of the state is located in Murfreesboro  The state of Tennessee is geographically and constitutionally divided into three Grand Divisions  East Tennessee  Middle Tennessee  and West Tennessee  Tennessee features six principal physiographic regions  the Blue Ridge  the Appalachian Ridge and Valley Region  the Cumberland Plateau  the Highland Rim  the Nashville Basin  and the Gulf Coastal Plain  Tennessee is home to the most caves in the United States  with over 8 350 caves registered to date   edit  East Tennessee Main article  East Tennessee Map of Tennessee highlighting East Tennessee The Blue Ridge area lies on the eastern edge of Tennessee  bordering North Carolina  This region of Tennessee is characterized by the high mountains and rugged terrain of the western Blue Ridge Mountains  which are subdivided into several subranges  namely the Great Smoky Mountains  the Bald Mountains  the Unicoi Mountains  the Unaka Mountains and Roan Highlands  and the Iron Mountains  The average elevation of the Blue Ridge area is 5 000 feet  1 500 m  above sea level  Clingmans Dome  the state s highest point  is located in this region  The Blue Ridge area was never more than sparsely populated  and today much of it is protected by the Cherokee National Forest  the Great Smoky Mountains National Park  and several federal wilderness areas and state parks  Stretching west from the Blue Ridge for approximately 55 miles  89 km  is the Ridge and Valley region  in which numerous tributaries join to form the Tennessee River in the Tennessee Valley  This area of Tennessee is covered by fertile valleys separated by wooded ridges  such as Bays Mountain and Clinch Mountain  The western section of the Tennessee valley  where the depressions become broader and the ridges become lower  is called the Great Valley  In this valley are numerous towns and two of the region s three urban areas  Knoxville  the 3rd largest city in the state  and Chattanooga  the 4th largest city in the state  The Cumberland Plateau rises to the west of the Tennessee Valley  this area is covered with flat topped mountains separated by sharp valleys  The elevation of the Cumberland Plateau ranges from 1 500 to over 2 000 feet  450 to over 600 m  above sea level   edit  Middle Tennessee Main article  Middle Tennessee Map of Tennessee highlighting Middle Tennessee West of the Cumberland Plateau is the Highland Rim  an elevated plain that surrounds the Nashville Basin  The northern section of the Highland Rim  known for its high tobacco production  is sometimes called the Pennyroyal Plateau  it is located primarily in Southwestern Kentucky  The Nashville Basin is characterized by rich  fertile farm country and great diversity of natural wildlife  Middle Tennessee was a common destination of settlers  crossing the Appalachians from Virginia in the late 18th century and early 19th century  An important trading route called the Natchez Trace  created and used for many generations by Native Americans  connected Middle Tennessee to the lower Mississippi River town of Natchez  The route of the Natchez Trace was used as the basis for a scenic highway called the Natchez Trace Parkway  Some of the last remaining large American Chestnut trees grow in this region  They are being used to help breed blight resistant trees  Middle Tennessee is one of the primary state population and transportation centers along with the heart of state government  Nashville  the capitol   Clarksville and Murfreesboro are its largest cities  Fifty percent of the US population is within 600 miles of Nashville  16  US Interstate Highways I 24  I 40 and I 65 trisect the Division   edit  West Tennessee Main article  West Tennessee Map of Tennessee highlighting West Tennessee West of the Highland Rim and Nashville Basin is the Gulf Coastal Plain  which includes the Mississippi embayment  The Gulf Coastal Plain is  in terms of area  the predominant land region in Tennessee  It is part of the large geographic land area that begins at the Gulf of Mexico and extends north into southern Illinois  In Tennessee  the Gulf Coastal Plain is divided into three sections that extend from the Tennessee River in the east to the Mississippi River in the west  The easternmost section  about 10 miles  16 km  in width  consists of hilly land that runs along the western bank of the Tennessee River  To the west of this narrow strip of land is a wide area of rolling hills and streams that stretches all the way to the Mississippi River  this area is called the Tennessee Bottoms or bottom land  In Memphis  the Tennessee Bottoms end in steep bluffs overlooking the river  To the west of the Tennessee Bottoms is the Mississippi Alluvial Plain  less than 300 feet  90 m  above sea level  This area of lowlands  flood plains  and swamp land is sometimes referred to as the Delta region  Memphis is the economic center of West Tennessee and the largest city in the state  Most of West Tennessee remained Indian land until the Chickasaw Cession of 1818  when the Chickasaw ceded their land between the Tennessee River and the Mississippi River  The portion of the Chickasaw Cession that lies in Kentucky is known today as the Jackson Purchase   edit  Public lands View from atop Mount Le Conte in Great Smoky Mountains National Park Areas under the control and management of the

parks  edit  Climate Most of the state has a humid subtropical climate  with the exception of some of the higher elevations in the Appalachians  which are classified as having a mountain temperate climate or a humid continental climate due to cooler temperatures  17  The Gulf of Mexico is the dominant factor in the climate of Tennessee  with winds from the south being responsible for most of the state s annual precipitation  Generally  the state has hot summers and mild to cool winters with generous precipitation throughout the year  On average the state receives 50 inches  130 cm  of precipitation annually  Snowfall ranges from 5 inches  13 cm  in West Tennessee to over 16 inches  41 cm  in the higher mountains in East Tennessee  18  Summers in the state are generally hot and humid  with most of the state averaging a high of around 90  F  32  C  during the summer months  Winters tend to be mild to cool  increasing in coolness at higher elevations  Generally  for areas outside the highest mountains  the average overnight lows are near freezing for most of the state  The highest recorded temperature is 113  F  45  C  at Perryville on August 9  1930 while the lowest recorded temperature is  32  F   36  C  at Mountain City on December 30  1917  While the state is far enough from the coast to avoid any direct impact from a hurricane  the location of the state makes it likely to be impacted from the remnants of tropical cyclones which weaken over land and can cause significant rainfall  such as Tropical Storm Chris in 1982  19  The state averages around 50 days of thunderstorms per year  some of which can be severe with large Hail and damaging winds  Tornadoes are possible throughout the state  with West and Middle Tennessee the most vulnerable  Occasionally  strong or violent tornadoes occur  20  On average  the state has 15 tornadoes per year  21  Tornadoes in Tennessee can be severe  and Tennessee leads the nation in the percentage of total tornadoes which have fatalities  22  Winter storms are an occasional problem  although ice storms are a more likely occurrence  Fog is a persistent problem in parts of the state  especially in much of the Smoky

edit  Early history Mississippian period art  carved from seashell  unearthed in Middle Tennessee Reconstruction of Fort Loudon  the first British settlement in Tennessee The area now known as Tennessee was first inhabited by Paleo Indians nearly 12 000 years ago  24  The names of the cultural groups that inhabited the area between first settlement and the time of European contact are unknown  but several distinct cultural phases have been named by archaeologists  including Archaic  8000 1000 BC   Woodland  1000 BC 1000 AD   and Mississippian  1000 1600 AD   whose chiefdoms were the cultural predecessors of the Muscogee people who inhabited the Tennessee River Valley prior to Cherokee migration into the river s headwaters  The first recorded European excursions into what is now called Tennessee were three expeditions led by Spanish explorers  namely Hernando de Soto in 1540  Tristan de Luna in 1559  and Juan Pardo in 1567  Pardo recorded the name  Tanasqui  from a local Indian village  which evolved to the state s current name  At that time  Tennessee was inhabited by tribes of Muscogee and Yuchi people  Possibly because of European diseases devastating the Native tribes  which would have left a population vacuum  and also from expanding European settlement in the north  the Cherokee moved south from the area now called Virginia  As European colonists spread into the area  the native populations were forcibly displaced to the south and west  including all Muscogee and Yuchi peoples  the Chickasaw  and Choctaw  The first British settlement in what is now Tennessee was Fort Loudoun  near present day Vonore  Fort Loudoun became the westernmost British outpost to that date  The fort was designed by John William Gerard de Brahm and constructed by forces under British Captain Raymond Demer   After its completion  Captain Raymond Demer  relinquished command on August 14  1757 to his brother  Captain Paul Demer   Hostilities erupted between the British and the neighboring Overhill Cherokees  and a siege of Fort Loudoun ended with its surrender on August 7  1760  The following morning  Captain Paul Demer  and a number of his men were killed in an ambush nearby  and the most of the rest of the garrison was taken prisoner  25  In the 1760s  long hunters from Virginia explored much of East and Middle Tennessee  and the first permanent European settlers began arriving late in the decade  The vast majority of 18th century settlers were English or of primarily English descent but nearly 20  of them were also Scotch Irish  26  These settlers formed the Watauga Association  a community built on lands leased from the Cherokee peoples  During the American Revolutionary War  Fort Watauga at Sycamore Shoals  in present day Elizabethton  was attacked  1776  by Dragging Canoe and his warring faction of Cherokee who were aligned with the British Loyalists  These renegade Cherokee were referred to by settlers as the Chickamauga  They opposed North Carolina s annexation of the Washington District and the concurrent settling of the Transylvania Colony further north and west  The lives of many settlers were spared from the initial warrior attacks through the warnings of Dragging Canoe s cousin  Nancy Ward  The frontier fort on the banks of the Watauga River later served as a 1780 staging area for the Overmountain Men in preparation to trek over the Appalachian Mountains  to engage  and to later defeat the British Army at the Battle of Kings Mountain in North Carolina  Three counties of the Washington District  now part of Tennessee  broke off from North Carolina in 1784 and formed the State of Franklin  Efforts to obtain admission to the Union failed  and the counties  now numbering eight  had re joined North Carolina by 1789  North Carolina ceded the area to the federal government in 1790  after which it was organized into the Southwest Territory  In an effort to encourage settlers to move west into the new territory  in 1787 the mother state of North Carolina ordered a road to be cut to take settlers into the Cumberland Settlements from the south end of Clinch Mountain  in East Tennessee  to French Lick  Nashville   The Trace was called the  North Carolina Road  or  Avery s Trace   and sometimes  The Wilderness Road  although it should not be confused with Daniel Boone s  Wilderness Road  through the Cumberland Gap    edit  Statehood  1796  Tennessee was admitted to the Union in 1796 as the 16th state  It was the first state created from territory under the jurisdiction of the United States federal government  Apart from the former Thirteen Colonies only Vermont and Kentucky predate Tennessee s statehood  and neither was ever a federal territory  27  The state boundaries  according to the Constitution of the State of Tennessee  Article I  Section 31  stated that the beginning point for identifying the boundary was the extreme height of the Stone Mountain  at the place where the line of Virginia intersects it  and basically ran the extreme heights of mountain chains through the Appalachian Mountains separating North Carolina from Tennessee past the Indian towns of Cowee and Old Chota  thence along the main ridge of the said mountain  Unicoi Mountain  to the southern boundary of the state  all the territory  lands and waters lying west of said line are included in the boundaries and limits of the newly formed state of Tennessee  Part of the provision also stated that the limits and jurisdiction of the state would include future land acquisition  referencing possible land trade with other states  or the acquisition of territory from west of the Mississippi River  During the administration of U S  President Martin Van Buren  nearly 17 000 Cherokees along with approximately 2 000 black slaves owned by Cherokees were uprooted from their homes between 1838 and 1839 and were forced by the U S  military to march from  emigration depots  in Eastern Tennessee  such as Fort Cass  toward the more distant Indian Territory west of Arkansas  28  During this relocation an estimated 4 000 Cherokees died along the way west  29  In the Cherokee language  the event is called Nunna daul Isunyi  the Trail Where We Cried   The Cherokees were not the only Native Americans forced to emigrate as a result of the Indian removal efforts of the United States  and so the phrase  Trail of Tears  is sometimes used to refer to similar events endured by other Native American peoples  especially among the  Five Civilized Tribes   The phrase originated as a description of the earlier emigration of the Choctaw nation   edit  Civil War and Reconstruction Main article  Tennessee in the American Civil War In February 1861  secessionists in Tennessee s state government led by Governor Isham Harris sought voter approval for a convention to sever ties with the United States  but Tennessee voters rejected the referendum by a 54 46  margin  The strongest opposition to secession came from East Tennessee  which later tried to form a separate Union aligned state   Following the Confederate attack upon Fort Sumter in April and Lincoln s call for troops from Tennessee and other states in response  Governor Isham Harris began military mobilization  submitted an ordinance of secession to the General Assembly  and made direct overtures to the Confederate government  The Tennessee legislature ratified an agreement to enter a military league with the Confederate States on May 7  1861  On June 8  1861  with people in Middle Tennessee having significantly changed their position  voters approved a second referendum calling for secession  becoming the last state to do so  Many major battles of the American Civil War were fought in Tennessee most of them Union victories  Ulysses S  Grant and the U S  Navy captured control of the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers in February 1862  They held off the Confederate counterattack at Shiloh in April  Memphis fell to the Union in June  following a naval battle on the Mississippi River in front of the city The Capture of Memphis and Nashville gave the Union control of the western and middle sections  this control was confirmed at the Battle of Murfreesboro in early January 1863 and by the subsequent Tullahoma Campaign  The Battle of Franklin  November 30  1864 Confederates held East Tennessee despite the strength of Unionist sentiment there  with the exception of extremely pro Confederate Sullivan County  The Confederates besieged Chattanooga during the Chattanooga Campaign in early fall 1863  but were driven off by Grant in November  Many of the Confederate defeats can be attributed to the poor strategic vision of General Braxton Bragg  who led the Army of Tennessee from Perryville  Kentucky to Confederate defeat at Chattanooga  The last major battles came when the Confederates invaded Middle Tennessee in November 1864 and were checked at Franklin  then completely diminished by George Thomas at Nashville in December  Meanwhile the civilian Andrew Johnson was appointed military governor of the state by President Abraham Lincoln  When the Emancipation Proclamation was announced  Tennessee was mostly held by Union forces  Thus  Tennessee was not among the states enumerated in the Proclamation  and the Proclamation did not free any slaves there  Nonetheless  enslaved African Americans escaped to Union lines to gain freedom without waiting for official action  Old and young  men  women and children camped near Union troops  Thousands of former slaves ended up fighting on the Union side  nearly 200 000 in total across the South  and some 30 000 blacks fought for the Confederates  Tennessee s legislature approved an amendment to the state constitution prohibiting slavery on February 22  1865  30  Voters in the state approved the amendment in March  31  It also ratified the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution  abolishing slavery in every state  on April 7  1865  In 1864  Andrew Johnson  a War Democrat from Tennessee  was elected Vice President under Abraham Lincoln  He became President after Lincoln s assassination in 1865  Under Johnson s lenient re admission policy  Tennessee was the first of the seceding states to have its elected members readmitted to the U S  Congress  on July 24  1866  Because Tennessee had ratified the Fourteenth Amendment  it was the only one of the formerly secessionist states that did not have a military governor during the Reconstruction period  After the formal end of Reconstruction  the struggle over power in Southern society continued  Through violence and intimidation against freedmen and their allies  White Democrats regained political power in Tennessee and other states across the South in the late 1870s and 1880s  Over the next decade  the state legislature passed increasingly restrictive laws to control African Americans  In 1889 the General Assembly passed four laws described as electoral reform  with the cumulative effect of essentially disfranchising most African Americans in rural areas and small towns  as well as many poor Whites  Legislation included implementation of a poll tax  timing of registration  and recording requirements  Tens of thousands of taxpaying citizens were without representation for decades into the 20th century  32  Disfranchising legislation accompanied Jim Crow laws passed in the late 19th century  which imposed segregation in the state  In 1900  African Americans made up nearly 24  of the state s population  and numbered 480 430 citizens who lived mostly in the central and western parts of the state  33  In 1897  Tennessee celebrated its centennial of statehood  though one year late of the 1896 anniversary  with a great exposition in Nashville  A full scale replica of the Parthenon was constructed for the celebration  located in what is now Nashville s Centennial Park   edit  20th century A group of workers at Norris Dam construction camp site  The TVA was formed as part of Roosevelt s New Deal legislation  On August 18  1920  Tennessee became the thirty sixth and final state necessary to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution  which provided women the right to vote  Disfranchising voter registration requirements continued to keep most African Americans and many poor whites  both men and women  off the voter rolls  The need to create work for the unemployed during the Great Depression  a desire for rural electrification  the need to control annual spring flooding and improve shipping capacity on the Tennessee River were all factors that drove the federal creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority  TVA  in 1933  Through the power of the TVA projects  Tennessee quickly became the nation s largest public utility supplier  During World War II  the availability of abundant TVA electrical power led the Manhattan Project to locate one of the principal sites for production and isolation of weapons grade fissile material in East Tennessee  The planned community of Oak Ridge was built from scratch to provide accommodations for the facilities and workers  These sites are now Oak Ridge National Laboratory  the Y 12 National Security Complex  and the East Tennessee Technology Park  Despite recognized effects of limiting voting by poor whites  successive legislatures expanded the reach of the disfranchising laws until they covered the state  In 1949 political scientist V  O  Key Jr  argued that  the size of the poll tax did not inhibit voting as much as the inconvenience of paying it  County officers regulated the vote by providing opportunities to pay the tax  as they did in Knoxville   or conversely by making payment as difficult as possible  Such manipulation of the tax  and therefore the vote  created an opportunity for the rise of urban bosses and political machines  Urban politicians bought large blocks of poll tax receipts and distributed them to blacks and whites  who then voted as instructed   32  In 1953 state legislators amended the state constitution  removing the poll tax  In many areas both blacks and poor whites still faced subjectively applied barriers to voter registration that did not end until after passage of national civil rights legislation  including the Voting Rights Act of 1965  32  Tennessee celebrated its bicentennial in 1996  With a yearlong statewide celebration entitled  Tennessee 200   it opened a new state park  Bicentennial Mall  at the foot of Capitol Hill in Nashville

 Although cotton was an early crop in Tennessee  large scale cultivation of the fiber did not begin until the 1820s with the opening of the land between the Tennessee and Mississippi Rivers  The upper

official who is elected statewide  Unlike most states  the state does not elect the lieutenant governor directly  the Tennessee Senate elects its Speaker  who serves as lieutenant governor  The Tennessee General Assembly  the state legislature  consists of the 33 member Senate and the 99 member House of Representatives  Senators serve four year terms  and House members serve two year terms  Each chamber chooses its own speaker  The speaker of the state Senate also holds the title of lieutenant governor  Constitutional officials in the legislative branch are elected by a joint session of

Except for in two nationwide Republican landslides of the 1920s  in 1920  when Tennessee narrowly supported Warren G  Harding over Ohio Governor James Cox  and in 1928  when it more decisively voted for Herbert Hoover over New York Governor Al Smith   the state was part of the Democratic Solid South until the 1950s  when it twice voted for Republican Dwight D  Eisenhower  Tennessee has since voted for Republicans in most presidential elections  though it tends to be somewhat more moderate than its staunchly conservative neighbors to the south  citation needed  While the Republicans control slightly more than half of the state  Democrats have moderate support in parts of rural Middle Tennessee and northern West Tennessee and have strong support in the cities of Nashville and Memphis  The latter area includes a large African American population  49  Historically  Republicans had their greatest strength in East Tennessee prior to the 1960s  Tennessee s 1st   2nd congressional districts based in East Tennessee are one of the few historically Republican districts in the South  the 1st has been in Republican hands continuously since 1881  and the 2nd district has been held continuously by Republicans since 1873  In contrast  long disfranchisement of African Americans and their proportion as a minority  16 45  in 1960  meant that white Democrats generally dominated politics in the rest of the state until the 1960s  The GOP in Tennessee was essentially a sectional party  Former Gov  Winfield Dunn and former U S  Sen  Bill Brock wins in 1970 built the Republican Party into a competitive party for the statewide victory  Tennessee has selected governors from different parties since 1970  In the 2000 presidential election  Vice President Al Gore  a former U S  Senator from Tennessee  failed to carry his home state  an unusual occurrence  Support for Republican George W  Bush increased in 2004  with his margin of victory in the state increasing from 4  in 2000 to 14  in 2004  50  Democratic presidential nominees from Southern states  such as Lyndon B  Johnson  Jimmy Carter  Bill Clinton  usually fare better than their Northern counterparts do in Tennessee  especially among split ticket voters outside the metropolitan areas  Tennessee sends nine members to the US House of Representatives  of whom there are seven Republicans and two Democrats  Lieutenant Governor Ron Ramsey is the first Republican speaker of the state Senate in 140 years  In 2008 elections  the Republican party gained control of both houses of the Tennessee state legislature for the first time since Reconstruction  Now considered as 30  of the state s electorate are independents  51  The Baker v  Carr  1962  decision of the US Supreme Court  which established the principle of one man  one vote  was based on a lawsuit over rural biased apportionment of seats in the Tennessee legislature  52  53  54  This significant ruling led to an increased  and proportional  prominence in state politics by urban and  eventually  suburban  legislators and statewide officeholders in relation to their population within the state  The ruling also applied to numerous other states long controlled by rural minorities  such as Alabama   edit  Law enforcement  edit  State agencies The state of Tennessee maintains four dedicated law enforcement entities  the Tennessee Highway Patrol  the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency  TWRA   the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation  TBI   and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation  TDEC   The Highway Patrol is the primary law enforcement entity that concentrates on highway safety regulations and general non wildlife state law enforcement and is under the jurisdiction of the Tennessee Department of Safety  The TWRA is an independent agency tasked with enforcing all wildlife  boating  and fisheries regulations outside of state parks  The TBI maintains state of the art investigative facilities and is the primary state level criminal investigative department  Tennessee State Park Rangers are responsible for all activities and law enforcement inside the Tennessee State Parks system   edit  Local government Local law enforcement is divided between County Sheriff s Offices and Municipal Police Departments  Tennessee s Constitution requires that each County have an elected Sheriff  In 94 of the 95 Counties the Sheriff is the chief law enforcement officer in the County and has jurisdiction over the county as a whole  Each Sheriff s Office is responsible for warrant service  court security  jail operations and primary law enforcement in the unincorporated areas of a county as well as providing support to the Municipal Police Departments  Incorporated municipalities are required to maintain a Police Department to provide police services within their corporate limits  The three Counties in Tennessee to adopt Metropolitan governments have taken different approaches to resolving the conflict that a Metro government presents to the requirement to have an elected Sheriff  Nashville Davidson County split law enforcement duties and authority between the Metro Sheriff and the Metro Police Chief  In this instance the Sheriff is no longer the chief law enforcement officer for Davidson County  The Davidson County Sheriff s duties focus on warrant service and jail operations  The Metropolitan Police Chief is the chief law enforcement officer and the Metropolitan Police Department provides primary law enforcement for the entire county  Lynchburg Moore County took a much simpler approach and abolished the Lynchburg Police Department when it consolidated and placed all law enforcement responsibility under the Sheriff s Office  Hartsville Trousdale County  although the smallest county in Tennessee  adopted a system similar to Nashville s that retains the Sheriff s Office but also has a Metropolitan Police Department   edit  Important cities and towns See also  List

routinely selling out more than 160 000 seats on each date as well as Nashville Superspeedway   edit  Name origin Monument near the ancient site of Tanasi in Monroe County The earliest variant of the name that became Tennessee was recorded by Captain Juan Pardo  the Spanish explorer  when he and his men passed through a Native American village named  Tanasqui  in 1567 while traveling inland from South Carolina  In the early 18th century  British traders encountered a Cherokee town named Tanasi  or  Tanase   in present day Monroe County  Tennessee  The town was located on a river of the same name  now known as the Little Tennessee River   and appears on maps as early as 1725  It is not known whether this was the same town as the one encountered by Juan Pardo  although recent research suggests that Pardo s  Tanasqui  was located at the confluence of the Pigeon River and the French Broad River  near modern Newport  55  The meaning and origin of the word are uncertain  Some accounts suggest it is a Cherokee modification of an earlier Yuchi word  It has been said to mean  meeting place    winding river   or  river of the great bend   56  57  According to James Mooney  the name  can not be analyzed  and its meaning is lost  58  The modern spelling  Tennessee  is attributed to James Glen  the governor of South Carolina  who used this spelling in his official correspondence during the 1750s  The spelling was popularized by the publication of Henry Timberlake s  Draught of the Cherokee Country  in 1765  In 1788  North Carolina created  Tennessee County   the third county to be established in what is now Middle Tennessee   Tennessee County was the predecessor to current day Montgomery County and Robertson County   When a constitutional convention met in 1796 to organize a new state out of the Southwest Territory  it adopted  Tennessee  as the name of the state   edit  Nickname Tennessee is known as the  Volunteer State   a nickname earned during the War of
