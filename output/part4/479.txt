Years of service 1832 Battles wars Black Hawk War Abraham Lincoln i  e br h m  l  k n   February 12  1809   April 15  1865  was the 16th President of the United States  serving from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865  He successfully led his country through a great constitutional  military and moral crisis   the American Civil War   preserving the Union  while ending slavery  and promoting economic and financial modernization  Reared in a poor family on the western frontier  Lincoln was mostly self educated  He became a country lawyer  an Illinois state legislator  and a one term member of the United States House of Representatives  but failed in two attempts to be elected to the United States Senate  After opposing the expansion of slavery in the United States in his campaign debates and speeches  1  Lincoln secured the Republican nomination and was elected president in 1860  Before Lincoln took office in March  seven southern slave states declared their secession and formed the Confederacy  When war began with the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter on April 12  1861  Lincoln concentrated on both the military and political dimensions of the war effort  seeking to reunify the nation  He vigorously exercised unprecedented war powers  including the arrest and detention without trial of thousands of suspected secessionists  He prevented British recognition of the Confederacy by skillfully handling the Trent affair late in 1861  He issued his Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and promoted the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution  abolishing slavery  Lincoln closely supervised the war effort  especially the selection of top generals  including commanding general Ulysses S  Grant  He brought leaders of various factions of his party into his cabinet and pressured them to cooperate  Under his leadership  the Union set up a naval blockade that shut down the South s normal trade  took control of the border slave states at the start of the war  gained control communications with gunboats on the southern river systems  and tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond  Each time a general failed  Lincoln substituted another until finally Grant succeeded in 1865  An exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state  he reached out to War Democrats and managed his own re election in the 1864 presidential election  As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican party  Lincoln found his policies and personality were  blasted from all sides   Radical Republicans demanded harsher treatment of the South  War Democrats desired more compromise  Copperheads despised him  and irreconcilable secessionists plotted his death  2  Politically  Lincoln fought back with patronage  by pitting his opponents against each other  and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory  3  His Gettysburg Address of 1863 became the most quoted speech in American history  4  It was an iconic statement of America s dedication to the principles of nationalism  equal rights  liberty  and democracy  At the close of the war  Lincoln held a moderate view of Reconstruction  seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness  But six days after the surrender of Confederate commanding general Robert E  Lee  Lincoln was assassinated by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth at Ford s Theatre  His death was the first assassination of a U S  president and sent the northern parts of the country into mourning  Lincoln has been consistently ranked by scholars and the public as one of the three greatest U S  presidents  5  6  Contents 1 Family and

second child of Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Lincoln  n e Hanks   in a one room log cabin on the Sinking Spring Farm in Hardin County  Kentucky  7   now LaRue County   Lincoln s paternal grandfather and namesake  Abraham  had moved his family from Virginia to Jefferson County  Kentucky  8  9  where he was ambushed and killed in an Indian raid in 1786  with his children  including Lincoln s father Thomas  looking on  9  Thomas was left to make his own way on the frontier  10  Lincoln s mother  Nancy  was the daughter of Lucy Hanks  and was born in what is now Mineral County  West Virginia  then part of Virginia  Lucy moved with Nancy to Kentucky  Nancy Hanks married Thomas  who became a respected citizen  He bought and sold several farms  including the Sinking Spring Farm  The family attended a Separate Baptists church  which had high moral standards and opposed alcohol  dancing  and slavery  11  Thomas enjoyed considerable status in Kentucky where he sat on juries  appraised estates  served on country slave patrols  and guarded prisoners  By the time his son Abraham was born  Thomas owned two 600 acre  240 ha  farms  several town lots  livestock  and horses  He was among the richest men in the county  8  12  However  in 1816  Thomas lost all of his land in court cases because of faulty property titles  13  The young Lincoln in sculpture at Senn Park  Chicago The family moved north across the Ohio River to free  i e   non slave  territory and made a new start in Perry County  Indiana  Lincoln later noted that this move was  partly on account of slavery  but mainly due to land title difficulties  13  In Indiana  when Lincoln was nine  his mother Nancy died of milk sickness in 1818  14  After the death of Lincoln s mother  his older sister  Sarah  took charge of caring for him until their father remarried in 1819  Sarah later died in her 20s while giving birth to a stillborn son  15  Thomas Lincoln s new wife was the widow Sarah Bush Johnston  the mother of three of her own children  Lincoln became very close to his stepmother  and referred to her as  Mother   16  As a pre teen  he did not like the hard labor associated with frontier life  Some in his family  and in the neighborhood  for a time considered him to be lazy  17  18  As he grew into his teens  he willingly took responsibility for all chores expected of him as one of the boys in the household and became an adept axeman in his work building rail fences  He attained a reputation for brawn and audacity after a very competitive wrestling match to which he was challenged by the renowned leader of a group of ruffians   the Clary s Grove boys   19  Lincoln also agreed with the customary obligation of a son to give his father all earnings from work done outside the home until age 21  14  In later years  Lincoln occasionally loaned his father money  20  Lincoln became increasingly distant from his father  in part because of his father s lack of education  While young Lincoln s formal elementary education consisted approximately of a year s worth of classes from several itinerant teachers  he was mostly self educated and was an avid reader  21  In 1830  fearing a milk sickness outbreak along the Ohio River  the Lincoln family moved west  where they settled on public land in Macon County  Illinois  another free  non slave state  22  In 1831  Thomas relocated the family to a new homestead in Coles County  Illinois  It was then that  as an ambitious 22 year old  Lincoln decided to seek a better life and struck out on his own  Canoeing down the Sangamon River  Lincoln ended up in the village of New Salem in Sangamon County  23  In the spring of 1831  hired by New Salem businessman Denton Offutt and accompanied by friends  he took goods by flatboat from New Salem to New Orleans via the Sangamon  Illinois  and Mississippi rivers  After arriving in New Orleans and witnessing slavery firsthand he walked back home  24  Marriage and children Further

Abraham Lincoln  age 28 Lincoln s first romantic interest was Ann Rutledge  whom he met when he first moved to New Salem  by 1835  they were in a relationship but not formally engaged  She died on August 25  most likely of typhoid fever  25  In the early 1830s  he met Mary Owens from Kentucky when she was visiting her sister  Late in 1836  Lincoln agreed to a match with Mary if she returned to New Salem  Mary did return in November 1836  and Lincoln courted her for a time  however  they both had second thoughts about their relationship  On August 16  1837  Lincoln wrote Mary a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship  She never replied and the courtship was over  26  In 1840  Lincoln became engaged to Mary Todd  who was from a wealthy slave holding family in Lexington  Kentucky  27  They met in Springfield  Illinois  in December 1839 28  and were engaged the following December  29  A wedding set for January 1  1841  was canceled when the two broke off their engagement at Lincoln s initiative  28  30  They later met again at a party and married on November 4  1842  in the Springfield mansion of Mary s married sister  31  While preparing for the nuptials and feeling anxiety again  Lincoln  when asked where he was going  replied   To hell  I suppose   32  In 1844  the couple bought a house in Springfield near Lincoln s law office  33  Mary Todd Lincoln worked diligently in their home  assuming full household duties which had previously been performed for her by slaves at her home in Kentucky  She efficiently used the limited income available from her husband s law practice  34 Robert Todd Lincoln was born in 1843 and Edward Baker Lincoln  Eddie  in 1846  Lincoln  was remarkably fond of children   35  and the Lincolns were not considered to be strict with their children  36  Robert was the only child to live to adulthood  Edward died on February 1  1850  in Springfield  likely of tuberculosis   Willie  Lincoln was born on December 21  1850  and died on February 20  1862  The Lincolns  fourth son  Thomas  Tad  Lincoln  was born on April 4  1853  and died of heart failure at the age of 18 on July 16  1871  37  The deaths of their sons had profound effects on both parents  Later in life  Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons  and Robert Lincoln committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 1875  38  Abraham Lincoln suffered from  melancholy   a condition which now is referred to as clinical depression  39  Lincoln s father in law was based in Lexington  Kentucky  he and others of the Todd family were either slave owners or slave traders  Lincoln was close to the Todds  and he and his family occasionally visited the Todd estate in Lexington  40  He was an affectionate  though often absent  husband and father of four children  Early career and militia service Main articles  Early life and career of Abraham Lincoln and Abraham Lincoln in the Black Hawk War In 1832  at age 23  Lincoln and a partner bought a small general store on credit in New Salem  Illinois  Although the economy was booming in the region  the business struggled and Lincoln eventually sold his share  That March he began his political career with his first campaign for the Illinois General Assembly  He had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural raconteur in New Salem  though he lacked an education  powerful friends  and money  which may be why he lost  He advocated navigational improvements on the Sangamon River  41  A sketch of candidate Abraham Lincoln Before the election Lincoln served as a captain in the Illinois Militia during the Black Hawk War  42  Following his return  Lincoln continued his campaign for the August 6 election for the Illinois General Assembly  At 6 feet 4 inches  193 cm   43  he was tall and  strong enough to intimidate any rival   At his first speech  when he saw a supporter in the crowd being attacked  Lincoln grabbed the assailant by his  neck and the seat of his trousers  and threw him  44  Lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates  the top four were elected   though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct  45  Lincoln served as New Salem s postmaster and later as county surveyor  all the while reading voraciously  He then decided to become a lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading Blackstone s Commentaries on the Laws of England and other law books  Of his learning method  Lincoln stated   I studied with nobody   46  His second campaign in 1834 was successful  He won election to the state legislature  though he ran as a Whig  many Democrats favored him over a more powerful Whig opponent  47 Admitted to the bar in 1836  48  he moved to Springfield  Illinois  and began to practice law under John T  Stuart  Mary Todd s cousin  49  Lincoln became an able and successful lawyer with a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross examinations and closing arguments  He partnered with Stephen T  Logan from 1841 until 1844  when he began his practice with William Herndon  whom Lincoln thought  a studious young man   50  He served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives as a Whig representative from Sangamon County  51  In the 1835 1836 legislative session  he voted to expand suffrage to white males  whether landowners or not  52  He was known for his  free soil  stance of opposing both slavery and abolitionism  He first articulated this in 1837  saying   Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy  but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils   53  He closely followed Henry Clay in supporting the American Colonization Society program of making the abolition of slavery practical by helping the freed slaves to settle in Liberia in Africa  54  Congressman Lincoln From the early 1830s  Lincoln was a steadfast Whig and professed to friends in 1861 to be   an old line Whig  a disciple of Henry Clay   55  The party  including Lincoln  favored economic modernization in banking  protective tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads  and espoused urbanization as well  56  In 1846  Lincoln was elected to the U S  House of Representatives  where he served one two year term  He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation  but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line  57  Lincoln  in collaboration with abolitionist Congressman Joshua R  Giddings  wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia with compensation for the owners  enforcement to capture fugitive slaves  and a popular vote on the matter  He abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient Whig supporters  58  On foreign and military policy  Lincoln spoke out against the Mexican American War  which he attributed to President Polk s desire for  military glory that attractive rainbow  that rises in showers of blood   59  Lincoln also supported the Wilmot Proviso  which  if it had been adopted  would have banned slavery in any U S  territory won from Mexico  60  Lincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his Spot Resolutions  The war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico and the US  Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had  invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow citizens on our own soil   61  62  Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil  62  Congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it  the national papers ignored it  and it resulted in a loss of political support for Lincoln in his district  One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him  spotty Lincoln   63  64  65  Lincoln later regretted some of his statements  especially his attack on the presidential war making powers  66  Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency  Lincoln  who had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the House  supported General Zachary Taylor for the Whig nomination in the 1848 presidential election  67  Taylor won and Lincoln hoped to be appointed Commissioner of the General Land Office  but that lucrative patronage job went to an Illinois rival  Justin Butterfield  considered by the administration to be a highly skilled lawyer  but in Lincoln s view  an  old fossil   68  The administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the Oregon Territory  This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold  and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in Illinois  so he declined and resumed his law practice  69  Prairie lawyer Lincoln in his late 30s   photo taken by one of Lincoln s law students around 1846 Lincoln returned to practicing law in Springfield  handling  every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer   70  Twice a year for 16 years  10 weeks at a time  he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session  71  Lincoln handled many transportation cases in the midst of the nation s western expansion  particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges  As a riverboat man  Lincoln initially favored those interests  but ultimately represented whoever hired him  72  His reputation grew  and he appeared before the Supreme Court of the United States  arguing a case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge  73  In 1849  he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water  The idea was never commercialized  but Lincoln is the only president to hold a patent  74  75  In 1851  he represented Alton  amp  Sangamon Railroad in a dispute with one of its shareholders  James A  Barret  who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares in the railroad on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route  76  77  Lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter in existence at the time of Barret s pledge  the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer  superior  and less expensive route  and the corporation retained the right to demand Barret s payment  The decision by the Illinois Supreme Court has been cited by numerous other courts in the nation  76  Lincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases  in 51 as sole counsel  of which 31 were decided in his favor  78  From 1853 to 1860  another of Lincoln s largest clients was the Illinois Central Railroad  79  Lincoln s most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended William  Duff  Armstrong  who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker  80  The case is famous for Lincoln s use of a fact established by judicial notice in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness  After an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight  Lincoln produced a Farmers  Almanac showing the moon was at a low angle  drastically reducing visibility  Based on this evidence  Armstrong was acquitted  80  Lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom  but in an 1859 case  where he defended a cousin Peachy Harrison  who was accused of stabbing another to death  Lincoln angrily protested the judge s decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client  Instead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as was expected  the judge  a Democrat  reversed his ruling  allowing the evidence and acquitting Harrison  80  81  Republican politics 1854 1860 Slavery and a  House Divided  Further information  Slave and free states  and Abraham Lincoln and slavery By the 1850s  slavery was still legal in the southern United States  but had been generally outlawed in the northern states  such as Illinois  82  Lincoln disapproved of slavery  and the spread of slavery to new U S  territory in the west  83  He returned to politics to oppose the pro slavery Kansas Nebraska Act  1854   this law repealed the slavery restricting Missouri Compromise  1820   Senior Senator Stephen A  Douglas of Illinois had incorporated popular sovereignty into the Act  Douglas  provision  which Lincoln opposed  specified settlers had the right to determine locally whether to allow slavery in new U S  territory  rather than have such a decision restricted by the national Congress  84  Foner  2010  contrasts the abolitionists and anti slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin  with the conservative Republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress  Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle  opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the Founding Fathers  especially the equality of all men and democratic self government as expressed in the Declaration of Independence  85  Portrait of Dred Scott  Lincoln denounced the Supreme Court decision in Dred Scott v  Sandford as a conspiracy  On October 16  1854  in his  Peoria Speech   Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery  which he repeated en route to the presidency  86  Speaking in his Kentucky accent  with a very powerful voice  87  he said the Kansas Act had a  declared indifference  but as I must think  a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery  I cannot but hate it  I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself  I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world     88  In late 1854  Lincoln ran as a Whig for the U S  Senate seat from Illinois  At that time  senators were elected by the state legislature  89  After leading in the first six rounds of voting in the Illinois assembly  his support began to dwindle  and Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for Lyman Trumbull  who defeated opponent Joel Aldrich Matteson  90  The Whigs had been irreparably split by the Kansas Nebraska Act  Lincoln wrote   I think I am a Whig  but others say there are no Whigs  and that I am an abolitionist  even though I do no more than oppose the extension of slavery   cite this quote  Drawing on remnants of the old Whig party  and on disenchanted Free Soil  Liberty  and Democratic party members  he was instrumental in forging the shape of the new Republican Party  91  At the 1856 Republican National Convention  Lincoln placed second in the contest to become the party s candidate for vice president  92  In 1857 58  Douglas broke with President James Buchanan  leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party  Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas for the Senate in 1858  since he had led the opposition to the Lecompton Constitution  which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state  93  In March 1857  the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dred Scott v  Sandford  Chief Justice Roger B  Taney opined that blacks were not citizens  and derived no rights from the Constitution  Lincoln denounced the decision  alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the Slave Power 94  Lincoln argued   The authors of the Declaration of Independence never intended  to say all were equal in color  size  intellect  moral developments  or social capacity   but they  did consider all men created equal equal in certain inalienable rights  among which are life  liberty  and the pursuit of happiness    95  After the state Republican party convention nominated him for the U S  Senate in 1858  Lincoln delivered his House Divided Speech  drawing on Mark 3 25   A house divided against itself cannot stand  I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free  I do not expect the Union to be dissolved I do not expect the house to fall but I do expect it will cease to be divided  It will become all one thing  or all the other   96  The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate  and rallied Republicans across the North  97  The stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the Illinois legislature which would  in turn  select Lincoln or Douglas as its U S  senator  98  Lincoln Douglas debates and Cooper Union speech A  Helser photographed Lincoln in 1860  The 1858 senate campaign featured the seven Lincoln Douglas debates of 1858  the most famous political debates in American history  99  The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically  Lincoln warned that  The Slave Power  was threatening the values of republicanism  and accused Douglas of distorting the values of the Founding Fathers that all men are created equal  while Douglas emphasized his Freeport Doctrine  that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not  and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists  100  The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands  Lincoln stated Douglas s popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation s morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states  Douglas said that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U S  Supreme Court and the Dred Scott decision  101  Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes  the Democrats won more seats  and the legislature re elected Douglas to the Senate  Despite the bitterness of the defeat for Lincoln  his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation  102  In May 1859  Lincoln purchased the Illinois Staats Anzeiger  a German language newspaper which was consistently supportive  most of the state s 130 000 German Americans voted Democratic but there was Republican support that a German language paper could mobilize  103  On February 27  1860  New York party leaders invited Lincoln to give a speech at Cooper Union to a group of powerful Republicans  Lincoln argued that the Founding Fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery  Lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the Republicans required opposition to slavery  and rejected any  groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong   104  Despite his inelegant appearance many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly 105  Lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the Republican presidential nomination  Journalist Noah Brooks reported   No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience   106  107  Donald described the speech as a  superb political move for an unannounced candidate  to appear in one rival s  William H  Seward  own state at an event sponsored by the second rival s  Salmon P  Chase  loyalists  while not mentioning either by name during its delivery   108  In response to an inquiry about his presidential intentions  Lincoln said   The taste is in my mouth a little   109  1860 Presidential nomination and campaign Main articles  Electoral history of Abraham Lincoln and United States presidential election  1860  The Rail Candidate  Lincoln s 1860 candidacy is depicted as held up by the slavery issue a slave on the left and party organization on the right  On May 9 10  1860  the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur  110  Lincoln s followers organized a campaign team led by David Davis  Norman Judd  Leonard Swett  and Jesse DuBois  and Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency  111  Exploiting the embellished legend of his frontier days with his father  Lincoln s supporters adopted the label of  The Rail Candidate   112  On May 18  at the Republican National Convention in Chicago  Lincoln s friends promised and manipulated and won the nomination on the third ballot  beating candidates such as William H  Seward and Salmon P  Chase  A former Democrat Hannibal Hamlin of Maine was nominated for Vice President to balance the ticket  Lincoln s success depended on his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue  and his strong support for Whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff  113  On the third ballot Pennsylvania put him over the top  Pennsylvania iron interests were reassured by his support for protective tariffs  114  Lincoln s managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as the others  while following Lincoln s strong dictate to  Make no contracts that bind me   115  Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party  as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government with the Dred Scott decision and the presidency of James Buchanan  Throughout the 1850s  Lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war  and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession  116  Meanwhile  Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats  with Herschel Vespasian Johnson as the vice presidential candidate  Delegates from 11 slave states walked out of the Democratic convention  disagreeing with Douglas s position on popular sovereignty  and ultimately selected John C  Breckinridge as their candidate  117  As Douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns  Lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches  Instead  he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party  The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North  and produced an abundance of campaign posters  leaflets  and newspaper editorials  There were thousands of Republican speakers who focused first on the party platform  and second on Lincoln s life story  emphasizing his childhood poverty  The goal was to demonstrate the superior power of  free labor   whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts  118  The Republican Party s production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition  a Chicago Tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln s life  and sold 100 000 to 200 000 copies  119  Presidency See also  Presidency of Abraham Lincoln 1860 election and

Capitol  The rotunda still under construction On November 6  1860  Lincoln was elected the 16th president of the United States  beating Democrat Stephen A  Douglas  John C  Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats  and John Bell of the new Constitutional Union Party  He was the first president from the Republican Party  Winning entirely on the strength of his support in the North and West  no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states  and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states  120  Lincoln received 1 866 452 votes  Douglas 1 376 957 votes  Breckinridge 849 781 votes  and Bell 588 789 votes  Turnout was 82 2 percent  with Lincoln winning the free Northern states  as well as California and Oregon  Douglas won Missouri  and split New Jersey with Lincoln  121  Bell won Virginia  Tennessee  and Kentucky  and Breckinridge won the rest of the South  122  Although Lincoln won only a plurality of the popular vote  his victory in the electoral college was decisive  Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123  There were fusion tickets in which all of Lincoln s opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York  New Jersey  and Rhode Island  but even if the anti Lincoln vote had been combined in every state  Lincoln still would have won a majority in the Electoral College  123  As Lincoln s election became evident  secessionists made clear their intent to leave the Union before he took office the next March  124  On December 20  1860  South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession  by February 1  1861  Florida  Mississippi  Alabama  Georgia  Louisiana  and Texas followed  125  126  Six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation  the Confederate States of America  125  The upper South and border states  Delaware  Maryland  Virginia  North Carolina  Tennessee  Kentucky  Missouri  and Arkansas  listened to  but initially rejected  the secessionist appeal  127  President Buchanan and President elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy  declaring secession illegal  128  The Confederacy selected Jefferson Davis as its provisional President on February 9  1861  129  There were attempts at compromise  The Crittenden Compromise would have extended the Missouri Compromise line of 1820  dividing the territories into slave and free  contrary to the Republican Party s free soil platform  130  Lincoln rejected the idea  saying   I will suffer death before I consent     to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right   131  Lincoln  however  did support the Corwin Amendment to the Constitution  which had passed in Congress and protected slavery in those states where it already existed  132  A few weeks before the war  he went so far as to pen a letter to every governor asking for their support in ratifying the Corwin Amendment as a means to avoid secession  133  En route to his inauguration by train  Lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the North  134  The president elect then evaded possible assassins in Baltimore  who were uncovered by Lincoln s head of security  Allan Pinkerton  On February 23  1861  he arrived in disguise in Washington  D C   which was placed under substantial military guard  135  Lincoln directed his inaugural address to the South  proclaiming once again that he had no intention  or inclination  to abolish slavery in the Southern states  Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that by the accession of a Republican Administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered  There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension  Indeed  the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection  It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you  I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that  I have no purpose  directly or indirectly  to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists  I believe I have no lawful right to do so  and I have no inclination to do so    First inaugural address  4 March 1861 136  The President ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South   We are not enemies  but friends  We must not be enemies     The mystic chords of memory  stretching from every battlefield  and patriot grave  to every living heart and hearthstone  all over this broad land  will yet swell the chorus of the Union  when again touched  as surely they will be  by the better angels of our nature   137  The failure of the Peace Conference of 1861 signaled that legislative compromise was implausible  By March 1861  no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms  Meanwhile  Lincoln and nearly every Republican leader agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated  138  War begins Main article  American Civil War Major Anderson  Ft  Sumter commander The commander of Fort Sumter  South Carolina  Major Robert Anderson sent a request for provisions to Washington  and the execution of Lincoln s order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war  On April 12  1861  Confederate forces fired on Union troops at Fort Sumter  forcing them to surrender  and began the war  Historian Allan Nevins argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations  underestimating the gravity of the crisis  exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South  and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion  139 William Tecumseh Sherman talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was  sadly disappointed  at his failure to realize that  the country was sleeping on a volcano  and that the South was preparing for war  140  Donald concludes that   His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft  Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood  But he also vowed not to surrender the forts  The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot  they did just that   141  On April 15  Lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75 000 troops to recapture forts  protect Washington  and  preserve the Union   which  in his view  still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states  This call forced the states to choose sides  Virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the Confederate capital  despite the exposed position of Richmond so close to Union lines  North Carolina  Tennessee  and Arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months  Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland  but did not prevail  Kentucky tried to be neutral  142  Troops headed south towards Washington to protect the capital in response to Lincoln s call  On April 19  secessionist mobs in Baltimore that controlled the rail links attacked Union troops traveling to the capital  George William Brown  the Mayor of Baltimore  and other suspect Maryland politicians were arrested and imprisoned  without a warrant  as Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus  143 John Merryman  a leader in the secessionist group in Maryland  petitioned Chief Justice Roger B  Taney to issue a writ of habeas corpus  saying holding Merryman without a hearing was unlawful  Taney issued the writ  thereby ordering Merryman s release  but Lincoln ignored it  Then and throughout the war  Lincoln came under heavy  often vituperative attack from antiwar Democrats  called Copperheads  144  Assuming command for the Union in the war After the fall of Fort Sumter  Lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and making an overall strategy to put down the rebellion  Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis  and he responded as commander in chief  using unprecedented powers  He expanded his war powers  and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports  disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress  and after suspending habeas corpus  arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers  Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions  In addition  Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict  145   Running the  Machine     An 1864 political cartoon takes a swing at Lincoln s administration featuring William Fessenden  Edwin Stanton  William Seward  Gideon Welles  Lincoln and others  The war effort was the source of continued disparagement of Lincoln  and dominated his time and attention  From the start  it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort  and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle  such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army  Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue  Conversely  the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery  146  On August 6  1861  Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort  In practice the law had little effect  but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy 147  In late August 1861  General John C  Fr mont  the 1856 Republican presidential nominee  issued  without consulting Washington  a proclamation of martial law in Missouri  He declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be court martialed and shot  and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed  Fr mont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the Department of the West compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption  Lincoln overruled Fr mont s proclamation  Lincoln believed that Fremont s emancipation was political  neither militarily necessary nor legal  148  Union enlistments from Maryland  Kentucky  and Missouri increased by over 40 000 troops  149  The Trent Affair of late 1861 threatened war with Great Britain  The U S  Navy illegally intercepted a British merchant ship the Trent on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys  Britain protested vehemently while the U S  cheered  Lincoln resolved the issue by releasing the two men and war was successfully averted with Britain  150  Lincoln s foreign policy approach had been initially hands off  due to his inexperience  he left most diplomacy appointments and other foreign policy matters to his Secretary of State  William Seward  Seward s initial reaction to the Trent affair  however  was too bellicose  so Lincoln also turned to Senator Charles Sumner  the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and an expert in British diplomacy  151  To learn technical military terms  Lincoln borrowed and studied Henry Halleck s book  Elements of Military Art and Science from the Library of Congress  152  Lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming in to the War Department in Washington  D C  He kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort  consulted with governors  and selected generals based on their past success  as well as their state and party   In January 1862  after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department  Lincoln replaced Cameron with Edwin Stanton as Secretary  Stanton was one of many conservative Democrats  he supported Breckenridge in the 1860 election  who became anti slavery Republicans under Lincoln s leadership  153  In terms of war strategy  Lincoln articulated two priorities  to ensure that Washington was well defended  and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt  decisive victory  major Northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days  154  Twice a week  Lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon  and occasionally Mary Lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard  155  Lincoln learned from his chief of staff General Henry Halleck  a student of the European strategist Jomini  of the critical need to control strategic points  such as the Mississippi River  156  he also knew well the importance of Vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy s army  rather than simply capturing territory  157  General McClellan After the Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run and the retirement of the aged Winfield Scott in late 1861  Lincoln appointed Major General George B  McClellan general in chief of all the Union armies  158  McClellan  a young West Point graduate  railroad executive  and Pennsylvania Democrat  took several months to plan and attempt his Peninsula Campaign  longer than Lincoln wanted  The campaign s objective was to capture Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the Confederate capital  McClellan s repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress  as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington  Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan s troops in defense of the capital  McClellan  who consistently overestimated the strength of Confederate troops  blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign  159  Lincoln and McClellan after the Battle of Antietam Lincoln removed McClellan as general in chief and appointed Henry Wager Halleck in March 1862  after McClellan s  Harrison s Landing Letter   in which he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort  160  McClellan s letter incensed Radical Republicans  who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint John Pope  a Republican  as head of the new Army of Virginia  Pope complied with Lincoln s strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north  thus protecting the capital from attack  However  lacking requested reinforcements from McClellan  now commanding the Army of the Potomac  Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1862  forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time  161  The war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the CSS Virginia  formerly the USS Merrimack  damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk  Virginia  before being engaged and damaged by the USS Monitor  Lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the Battle of Hampton Roads  162  Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan s failure to reinforce Pope  Lincoln was desperate  and restored him to command of all forces around Washington  to the dismay of all in his cabinet but Seward  163  Two days after McClellan s return to command  General Robert E  Lee s forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland  leading to the Battle of Antietam in September 1862  164  The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history  but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January  Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier  Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation  165  McClellan then resisted the President s demand that he pursue Lee s retreating and exposed army  while his counterpart General Don Carlos Buell likewise refused orders to move the Army of the Ohio against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee  As a result  Lincoln replaced Buell with William Rosecrans  and  after the 1862 midterm elections  he replaced McClellan with Republican Ambrose Burnside  Both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the Commander in Chief  166  Burnside  against the advice of the president  prematurely launched an offensive across the Rappahannock River and was stunningly defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg in December  Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield  but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined  Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg  167  Lincoln brought in Joseph Hooker  despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship  168  The mid term elections in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war  as well as rising inflation  new high taxes  rumors of corruption  the suspension of habeas corpus  the military draft law  and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market  The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for the Republicans in the rural areas of New England and the upper Midwest  but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest  While Republicans were discouraged  Democrats were energized and did especially well in Pennsylvania  Ohio  Indiana  and New York  The Republicans did maintain their majorities in Congress and in the major states  except New York  The Cincinnati Gazette contended that the voters were  depressed by the interminable nature of this war  as so far conducted  and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress   169  In the spring of 1863  Lincoln was optimistic about upcoming campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together  these plans included Hooker s attack on Lee north of Richmond  Rosecrans  on Chattanooga  Grant s on Vicksburg  and a naval assault on Charleston  170  Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May  171  but continued to command his troops for some weeks  He ignored Lincoln s order to divide his troops  and possibly force Lee to do the same in Harper s Ferry  and tendered his resignation  which Lincoln accepted  He was replaced by George Meade  who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the Gettysburg Campaign  which was a victory for the Union  though Lee s army avoided capture  At the same time  after initial setbacks  Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor  172  After the Battle of Gettysburg  Lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his War Secretary or his general in chief on to his generals  who resented his civilian interference with their own plans  Even so  he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as Commander in Chief  173  Emancipation Proclamation Main articles  Abraham Lincoln and slavery and Emancipation Proclamation Lincoln presents the first draft of the Emancipation Proclamation to his cabinet  Painted by Francis Bicknell Carpenter in 1864 Lincoln understood that the Federal government s power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution  which before 1865  committed the issue to individual states  He argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U S  territory  At the beginning of the war  he also sought to persuade the states to accept compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery  an offer that took effect only in Washington  D C   in April 1862   Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it  as envisioned by the Founding Fathers  under the constitution  174  President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by Major General John C  Fr mont in August 1861 and by Major General David Hunter in May 1862  on the grounds that it was not within their power  and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union  175  On June 19  1862  endorsed by Lincoln  Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory  In July 1862  the Second Confiscation Act was passed  which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion  Although Lincoln believed it was not within Congress s power to free the slaves within the states  he approved the bill in deference to the legislature  He felt such action could only be taken by the commander in chief using war powers granted to the president by the Constitution  and Lincoln was planning to take that action  In that month  Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet  In it  he stated that  as a fit and necessary military measure  on January 1  1863  all persons held as slaves in the Confederate states will thenceforward  and forever  be free   176  Privately  Lincoln concluded at this point that the war could not be won without freeing the slaves  However Confederate and anti war propagandists had success spreading the theme that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification  Republican editor Horace Greeley of the highly influential New York Tribune fell for the ploy  177  and Lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of August 22  1862  The President said the primary goal of his actions as president  he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his  official duty   was preserving the Union  178  My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union  and is not either to save or to destroy slavery  If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it  and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it  and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that  What I do about slavery  and the colored race  I do because I believe it helps to save the Union  and what I forbear  I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union            I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty  and I intend no modification of my oft expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free  179  The Emancipation Proclamation  issued on September 22  1862  and put into effect on January 1  1863  declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control  with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states  180  Once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective  as Union armies advanced south  more slaves were liberated until over three million of them in Confederate territory were freed  Lincoln s comment on the signing of the Proclamation was   I never  in my life  felt more certain that I was doing right  than I do in signing this paper   181  For some time  Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves  He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation  but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed  182  A few days after Emancipation was announced  13 Republican governors met at the War Governors  Conference  they supported the president s Proclamation  but suggested the removal of General George B  McClellan as commander of the Union Army  183  Using former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation  At first  Lincoln was reluctant to fully implement this program  but by the spring of 1863  he was ready to initiate  a massive recruitment of Negro troops   In a letter to Andrew Johnson  the military governor of Tennessee  encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops  Lincoln wrote   The bare sight of 50 000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once   184  By the end of 1863  at Lincoln s direction  General Lorenzo Thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley  185 Frederick Douglass once observed of Lincoln   In his company  I was never reminded of my humble origin  or of my unpopular color   186  Gettysburg Address Main article  Gettysburg Address With the great Union victory at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863  and the defeat of the Copperheads in the Ohio election in the fall  Lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort  despite the New York City draft riots  The stage was set for his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery  187  Defying Lincoln s prediction that  the world will little note  nor long remember what we say here   the Address became the most quoted speech in American history  4  The Gettysburg Address was delivered at the dedication of the Soldiers  National Cemetery in Gettysburg  Pennsylvania  on the afternoon of Thursday  November 19  1863  In 272 words  and three minutes  Lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789  but in 1776   conceived in Liberty  and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal   He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all  The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort  He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain  that slavery would end as a result of the losses  and the future of democracy would be assured  that  government of the people  by the people  for the people  shall not perish from the earth   Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective  a new birth of freedom in the nation  188  189  General Grant President Lincoln  center right  with  from left  Generals Sherman  Grant and Admiral Porter   1868 painting of events aboard the River Queen in March  1865 Meade s failure to capture Lee s army as it retreated from Gettysburg  and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac  persuaded Lincoln that a change in command was needed  General Ulysses S  Grant s victories at the Battle of Shiloh and in the Vicksburg campaign impressed Lincoln and made Grant a strong candidate to head the Union Army  Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh  Lincoln had said   I can t spare this man  He fights   190  With Grant in command  Lincoln felt the Union Army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters  and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops  191  Nevertheless  Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a candidacy for President in 1864  as McClellan was  Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into Grant s political intentions  and being assured that he had none  submitted to the Senate Grant s promotion to commander of the Union Army  He obtained Congress s consent to reinstate for Grant the rank of Lieutenant General  which no officer had held since George Washington  192  Grant waged his bloody Overland Campaign in 1864  This is often characterized as a war of attrition  given high Union losses at battles such as the Battle of the Wilderness and Cold Harbor  Even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive  the Confederate forces had  almost as high a percentage of casualties as the Union forces   193  The high casualty figures of the Union alarmed the North  Grant had lost a third of his army  and Lincoln asked what Grant s plans were  to which the general replied   I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer   194  The Confederacy lacked reinforcements  so Lee s army shrank with every battle  forcing it back to trenches outside Petersburg  Virginia  where Grant began a siege  Lincoln then made an extended visit to Grant s headquarters at City Point  Virginia  This allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman about the hostilities  as Sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to Grant from his position in North Carolina  195  Lincoln and the Republican party mobilized support for the draft throughout the North  and replaced his losses  196  Lincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructure such as plantations  railroads  and bridges hoping to destroy the South s morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting  Grant s move to Petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between Richmond and the South  This strategy allowed Generals Sherman and Philip Sheridan to destroy plantations and towns in Virginia s Shenandoah Valley  The damage caused by Sherman s March to the Sea through Georgia in 1864 was limited to a 60 mile  97 km  swath  but neither Lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal  but rather defeat of the Confederate armies  As Neely  2004  concludes  there was no effort to engage in  total war  against civilians  as in World War II  197  Confederate general Jubal Anderson Early began a series of assaults in the North that threatened the Capital  During his raid on Washington  D C  in 1864  Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position  Captain Oliver Wendell Holmes shouted at him   Get down  you damn fool  before you get shot   198  After repeated calls on Grant to defend Washington  Sheridan was appointed and the threat from Early was dispatched  199  As Grant continued to wear down Lee s forces  efforts to discuss peace began  Confederate Vice President Stephens led a group to meet with Lincoln  Seward  and others at Hampton Roads  Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal  his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results  200  On April 1  1865  Grant successfully outflanked Lee s forces in the Battle of Five Forks and nearly encircled Petersburg  and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond  Days later  when that city fell  Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital  as he walked through the city  white Southerners were stone faced  but freedmen greeted him as a hero  On April 9  Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox and the war was effectively over  201  1864 re election Main articles  Electoral history of Abraham Lincoln and United States presidential election  1864 Lincoln was a master politician  bringing together and holding together all the main factions of the Republican Party  and bringing in War Democrats such as Edwin M  Stanton and Andrew Johnson as well  Lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers greatly expanded over peacetime to hold the factions of his party together  build support for his own policies  and fend off efforts by Radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket  202  203  At its 1864 convention  the Republican Party selected Andrew Johnson  a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee  as his running mate  To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans  Lincoln ran under the label of the new Union Party  204  When Grant s spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and Union casualties mounted  the lack of military success wore heavily on the President s re election prospects  and many Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated  Sharing this fear  Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that  if he should lose the election  he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House  205  This morning  as for some days past  it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re elected  Then it will be my duty to so co operate with the President elect  as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration  as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward  206  Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet  but asked them to sign the sealed envelope  An electoral landslide  in red  for Lincoln in the 1864 election  southern states  brown  and territories  light brown  not in play Lincoln s second inaugural address in 1865 at the almost completed Capitol building While the Democratic platform followed the Peace wing of the party and called the war a  failure   their candidate  General George B  McClellan  supported the war and repudiated the platform  Lincoln provided Grant with more troops and mobilized his party to renew its support of Grant in the war effort  Sherman s capture of Atlanta in September and David Farragut s capture of Mobile ended defeatist jitters  207  the Democratic Party was deeply split  with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln  By contrast  the National Union Party was united and energized as Lincoln made emancipation the central issue  and state Republican parties stressed the perfidy of the Copperheads  208  Lincoln was re elected in a landslide  carrying all but three states  and receiving 78 percent of the Union soldiers  vote  209  On March 4  1865  Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address  In it  he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be God s will  Historian Mark Noll concludes it ranks  among the small handful of semi sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world   210  Lincoln said  Fondly do we hope fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away  Yet  if God wills that it continue  until all the wealth piled by the bond man s 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk  and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash  shall be paid by another drawn with the sword  as was said 3 000 years ago  so still it must be said   the judgments of the Lord  are true and righteous altogether   With malice toward none  with charity for all  with firmness in the right  as God gives us to see the right  let us strive on to finish the work we are in  to bind up the nation s wounds  to care for him who shall have borne the battle  and for his widow  and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace  among ourselves  and with all nations  211  Reconstruction Main article  Reconstruction Era of the United States Reconstruction began during the war  as Lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states  and how to determine the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves  Shortly after Lee s surrender  a general had asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated  and Lincoln replied   Let  em up easy   212  In keeping with that sentiment  Lincoln led the moderates regarding Reconstruction policy  and was opposed by the Radical Republicans  under Rep  Thaddeus Stevens  Sen  Charles Sumner and Sen  Benjamin Wade  political allies of the president on other issues  Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South  Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war  His Amnesty Proclamation of December 8  1863  offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office  had not mistreated Union prisoners  and would sign an oath of allegiance  213  A political cartoon of Andrew Johnson and Abraham Lincoln  1865  entitled  The Rail Splitter At Work Repairing the Union   The caption reads  Johnson   Take it quietly Uncle Abe and I will draw it closer than ever   Lincoln   A few more stitches Andy and the good old Union will be mended  As Southern states were subdued  critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re formed  Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas  where Lincoln appointed Generals Andrew Johnson and Frederick Steele as military governors  respectively  In Louisiana  Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P  Banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it  Lincoln s Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans  political aspirations  On the other hand  the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient  and passed their own plan  the Wade Davis Bill  in 1864  When Lincoln vetoed the bill  the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana  Arkansas  and Tennessee  214  Lincoln s appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and Radical factions in harness  To fill Chief Justice Taney s seat on the Supreme Court  he named the choice of the Radicals  Salmon P  Chase  who Lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies  215  After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation  which did not apply to every state  Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment  Lincoln declared that such an amendment would  clinch the whole matter   216  By December 1863 a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery absolutely was brought to Congress for passage  This first attempt at an amendment failed to pass  falling short of the required two thirds majority on June 15  1864  in the House of Representatives  Passage of the proposed amendment became part of the Republican Unionist platform in the election of 1864  After a long debate in the House  a second attempt passed Congress on January 13  1865  and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification  217  Upon ratification  it became the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution on December 6  1865  218  As the war drew to a close  Lincoln s presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux  having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen  He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner s Freedman s Bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves  The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen  Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction  Shortly before his assassination  Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction  Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short term military control over southern states  until readmission under the control of southern Unionists  219  Redefining the republic and republicanism The last high quality photograph of Lincoln was taken March 1865  The successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country  The term  the United States  has historically been used  sometimes in the plural   these United States    and other times in the singular  without any particular grammatical consistency  The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century  220  In recent years  historians such as Harry Jaffa  Herman Belz  John Diggins  Vernon Burton and Eric Foner have stressed Lincoln s redefinition of republican values  As early as the 1850s  a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution  Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values what he called the  sheet anchor  of republicanism  221  The Declaration s emphasis on freedom and equality for all  in contrast to the Constitution s tolerance of slavery  shifted the debate  As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860   Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself   222  His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism  rather than its legalisms  223  Nevertheless  in 1861  Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms  the Constitution was a contract  and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree   and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state  224  Burton  2008  argues that Lincoln s republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated  225  In March 1861  in his First Inaugural Address  Lincoln explored the nature of democracy  He denounced secession as anarchy  and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the American system  He said  A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations  and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments  is the only true sovereign of a free people   226  Other enactments Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of the presidency  which gave Congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them  Lincoln only vetoed four bills passed by Congress  the only important one was the Wade Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction  227  He signed the Homestead Act in 1862  making millions of acres of government held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost  The Morrill Land Grant Colleges Act  also signed in 1862  provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state  The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States  First Transcontinental Railroad  which was completed in 1869  228  The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s  229  The Lincoln Cabinet 230  Office Name Term President Abraham Lincoln

Interior Caleb B  Smith 1861 1862 John P  Usher 1863 1865 Other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the Federal government  tariffs  a policy with long precedent   and a new Federal income tax  In 1861  Lincoln signed the second and third Morrill Tariff  the first having become law under James Buchanan  In 1861  Lincoln signed the Revenue Act of 1861  creating the first U S  income tax  231  This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above  800  which was later changed by the Revenue Act of 1862 to a progressive rate structure  232  Lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government s economic influence in several other areas  The creation of the system of national banks by the National Banking Act provided a strong financial network in the country  It also established a national currency  In 1862  Congress created  with Lincoln s approval  the Department of Agriculture  233  In 1862  Lincoln sent a senior general  John Pope  to put down the  Sioux Uprising  in Minnesota  Presented with 303 execution warrants for convicted Santee Dakota who were accused of killing innocent farmers  Lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants  eventually approving 39 for execution  one was later reprieved   234  President Lincoln had planned to reform federal Indian policy  235  In the wake of Grant s casualties in his campaign against Lee  Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft  but it was never issued  In response to rumors of one  however  the editors of the New York World and the Journal of Commerce published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market  Lincoln s reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior  he ordered the military to seize the two papers  The seizure lasted for two days  236  Lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States  237  Before Lincoln s presidency  Thanksgiving  while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century  had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates  The last such proclamation had been during James Madison s presidency 50 years before  In 1863  Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving  237  In June 1864  Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress  which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as Yosemite National Park  238  Supreme Court appointments Lincoln s declared philosophy on court nominations was that  we cannot ask a man what he will do  and if we should  and he should answer us  we should despise him for it  Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known   237  Lincoln made five appointments to the United States Supreme Court  Noah Haynes Swayne  nominated January 21  1862 and appointed January 24  1862  was chosen as an anti slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union  Samuel Freeman Miller  nominated and appointed on July 16  1862  supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist  David Davis  Lincoln s campaign manager in 1860  nominated December 1  1862 and appointed December 8  1862  had also served as a judge in Lincoln s Illinois court circuit  Stephen Johnson Field  a previous California Supreme Court justice  was nominated March 6  1863 and appointed March 10  1863  and provided geographic balance  as well as political balance to the court as a Democrat  Finally  Lincoln s Treasury Secretary  Salmon P  Chase  was nominated as Chief Justice  and appointed the same day  on December 6  1864  Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist  would support Reconstruction legislation  and that his appointment united the Republican Party  239  States admitted to the Union West Virginia  admitted to the Union June 20  1863  contained the former north westernmost counties of Virginia that seceded from Virginia after that commonwealth declared its secession from the Union  Nevada  which became the third State in the far west of the continent  was admitted October 31  1864  Lincoln recognized both of these state governments when formed locally  but was not otherwise involved prior to their admission by Congress  240  Assassination Main articles  Assassination of Abraham Lincoln and Funeral and burial of Abraham Lincoln John Wilkes Booth was a well known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland  though he never joined the Confederate army  he had contacts with the Confederate secret service  241  In 1864  Booth formulated a plan  very similar to one of Thomas N  Conrad previously authorized by the Confederacy  242  to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners  Shown in the presidential booth of Ford s Theatre  from left to right  are Henry Rathbone  Clara Harris  Mary Todd Lincoln  Abraham Lincoln  and his assassin John Wilkes Booth  After attending an April 11  1865  speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks  an incensed Booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president  243  Learning that the President  First Lady  and head Union general Ulysses S  Grant would be attending Ford s Theatre  Booth formulated a plan with co conspirators to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson  Secretary of State William H  Seward and General Grant  Without his main bodyguard  Ward Hill Lamon  Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14  Grant along with his wife chose at the last minute to travel to Philadelphia instead of attending the play  244  Lincoln s bodyguard  John Parker  left Ford s Theater during intermission to join Lincoln s coachman for drinks in the Star Saloon next door  The now unguarded President sat in his state box in the balcony  Seizing the opportunity  Booth crept up from behind and at about 10 13 pm  aimed at the back of Lincoln s head and fired at point blank range  mortally wounding the President  Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth  but Booth stabbed him and escaped  245  246  After being on the run for 10 days  Booth was tracked down and found on a farm in Virginia  some 30 miles  48 km  south of Washington  D C  After a brief fight  Booth was killed by Union soldiers on April 26  247  An Army surgeon  Doctor Charles Leale  assessed Lincoln s wound as mortal  The dying man was taken across the street to Petersen House  After being in a coma for nine hours  Lincoln died at 7 22 am on April 15  Presbyterian minister Phineas Densmore Gurley  then present  was asked to offer a prayer  after which Secretary of War Stanton saluted and said   Now he belongs to the ages   248  Lincoln s flag enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers  while the city s church bells rang  Vice President Johnson was sworn in as President at 10 00 am the day after the assassination  Lincoln lay in state in the East Room  and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21  For three weeks  his funeral train brought the body to cities across the North for large scale memorials attended by hundreds of thousands  as well as many people who gathered in informal trackside tributes with bands  bonfires and hymn singing  249  250  Religious and philosophical beliefs Further information  Abraham Lincoln and religion Lincoln  painting by George Peter Alexander Healy in 1869 Scholars have extensively written on topics concerning Lincoln s beliefs and philosophy  e g  whether Lincoln s frequent use of religious imagery and language reflected his own personal beliefs or was a device to appeal to his audiences  who were mostly evangelical Protestants  251  Though he never joined a church  Lincoln was familiar with the Bible  quoted it and praised it  252  In the 1840s Lincoln subscribed to the Doctrine of Necessity  a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power  253  In the 1850s  Lincoln acknowledged  providence  in a general way  and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals  he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence  254  When he suffered the death of his son Edward  Lincoln more frequently acknowledged his own need to depend on God  255  The death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace  256  After Willie s death  Lincoln considered why  from a divine standpoint  the severity of the war was necessary  He wrote at this time that God  could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest  Yet the contest began  And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day  Yet the contest proceeds   257  Historical reputation In surveys of scholars ranking Presidents since the 1940s  Lincoln is consistently ranked in the top three  often  1  5  6  A 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked Lincoln number one  while legal scholars placed him second after Washington  258  Of all the presidential ranking polls conducted since 1948  Lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority of polls  Schlesinger 1948  Schlesinger 1962  1982 Murray Blessing Survey  Chicago Tribune 1982 poll  Schlesinger 1996  CSPAN 1996  Ridings McIver 1996  Time 2008  and CSPAN 2009  Generally  the top three presidents are rated as 1  Lincoln  2  George Washington  and 3  Franklin D  Roosevelt  although Lincoln and Washington  and Washington and Roosevelt  occasionally are reversed  259  President Lincoln s assassination made him a national martyr and endowed him with a recognition of mythic proportion  Lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty  Republicans linked Lincoln s name to their party  Many  though not all  in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability  260  The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum focuses on Lincoln scholarship and popular interpretation Schwartz argues that Lincoln s reputation grew slowly in the late 19th century until the Progressive Era  1900 1920s  when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in American history  with even white Southerners in agreement  The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the Mall in Washington  261  In the New Deal era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self made man or the great war president  but as the advocate of the common man who doubtless would have supported the welfare state  In the Cold War years  Lincoln s image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes  262  By the 1970s Lincoln had became a hero to political conservatives 263  for his intense nationalism  support for business  his insistence on stopping the spread of un freedom  slavery   his acting in terms of Lockean and Burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition  and his devotion to the principles of the Founding Fathers  264  265  266  As a Whig activist  Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests  favoring high tariffs  banks  internal improvements  and railroads in opposition to the agrarian Democrats  267  William C  Harris found that Lincoln s  reverence for the Founding Fathers  the Constitution  the laws under it  and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism    268  James G  Randall emphasizes his tolerance and his especially his moderation  in his preference for orderly progress  his distrust of dangerous agitation  and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform   Randall concludes that   he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so called  radicalism  which involved abuse of the South  hatred for the slaveholder  thirst for vengeance  partisan plotting  and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders   269  By the late 1960s  liberals  such as historian Lerone Bennett  were having second thoughts  especially regarding Lincoln s views on racial issues  270  271  Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a white supremacist in 1968  272  He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs  told jokes that ridiculed blacks  insisted he opposed social equality  and proposed sending freed slaves to another country  Defenders  such as authors Dirck and Cashin  retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians  273  and that he was a  moral visionary  who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause  as fast as politically possible  274  The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery  or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation  275  276  Historian Barry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln s image suffered  erosion  fading prestige  benign ridicule   in the late 20th century  277  On the other hand  Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability  defined by the poet John Keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were  content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts  and not compelled toward fact or reason   278  Memorials Further information  Cultural depictions of Abraham Lincoln Lincoln Memorial in Washington  D C  Lincoln statue in Edinburgh Lincoln has been memorialized in many town  city  and county names  279  including the capital of Nebraska  The first public monument to Abraham Lincoln was a statue erected in front of the District of Columbia City Hall in 1868  three years after his assassination  280  Lincoln s name and image appear in numerous other places  such as the Lincoln Memorial in Washington  D C  and Lincoln s sculpture on Mount Rushmore  281  Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park in Hodgenville  Kentucky  282  Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial in Lincoln City  Indiana  283 Lincoln s New Salem  Illinois  284  and Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield  Illinois 285  commemorate the president  286 Ford s Theatre and Petersen House  where he died  are maintained as museums  as is the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum  located in Springfield  287  288  The Lincoln Tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield  Illinois  contains his remains and those of his wife Mary and three of his four sons  Edward  William  and Thomas  289  Within a year of this death  his image began to be disseminated throughout the world on stamps  290  and he is the only U S  President to appear on a U S  airmail stamp  291  Currency honoring the president includes the United States  five dollar bill and the Lincoln cent  which represents the first regularly circulating U S  coin to feature an actual person s image  292  The first statue of Lincoln outside the United States was erected in Edinburgh  Scotland in 1893  The work of George Edwin Bissell  it stands on a memorial to Scots immigrants who enlisted with the Union during the Civil War  the only memorial to the war erected outside the United States  A large statue of Lincoln standing was unveiled near Westminster Abbey in London  on July 28  1920  in an elaborate ceremony  The principal addresses were delivered in the abbey church  293  Abraham Lincoln s birthday  February 12  was never a national holiday  but it was at one time observed by as many as 30 states  279  In 1971  Presidents Day became a national holiday  combining Lincoln s and Washington s birthdays and replacing most states  celebration of his birthday  294  The Abraham Lincoln Association was formed in 1908 to commemorate the centennial of Lincoln s birth  295  In 2000  Congress established the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission to commemorate his 200th birthday in February 2009  296  Lincoln sites remain popular tourist attractions  but crowds have thinned  In the late 1960s  650 000 people a year visited the home in Springfield  slipping to 393 000 in 2000 2003  Likewise visits to New Salem fell by half  probably because of the enormous draw of the new museum in Springfield  Visits to the Lincoln Memorial in Washington peaked at 4 3 million in 1987 and have since declined  However crowds at Ford s Theatre in Washington have grown sharply  297  References
