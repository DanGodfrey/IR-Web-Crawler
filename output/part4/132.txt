a Caribbean country  It occupies the western  smaller portion of the island of Hispaniola  in the Greater Antillean archipelago  which it shares with the Dominican Republic  Ayiti  land of high mountains  was the indigenous Ta no or Amerindian name for the island  The country s highest point is Pic la Selle  at 2 680 metres  8 793 ft   The total area of Haiti is 27 750 square kilometres  10 714 sq mi  and its capital is Port au Prince  Haitian Creole and French are the official languages  Haiti s regional  historical  and ethno linguistic position is unique for several reasons  It was the first independent nation in Latin America and the Caribbean and the first black led republic in the world when it gained independence as part of a successful slave revolution in 1804  6  In 2012  it signalled its intention to seek associate membership status in the African Union  7  Haiti is the only predominantly Francophone independent nation in the Americas  It is one of only two independent nations in the Americas  along with Canada  that designate French as an official language  the other French speaking areas are all overseas d partements  or collectivit s  of France  Haiti is the most populous full member state of the Caribbean Community  CARICOM  bloc and also the poorest country in the Americas as per the Human Development Index  It has experienced political violence throughout its history  Most recently  in February 2004  an armed rebellion forced the resignation and exile of previous President Jean Bertrand Aristide  and a provisional government took control with security provided by the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti  MINUSTAH   Michel Martelly  the current president  was elected in the Haitian general election  2011  A 7 0 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti and devastated Port au Prince on 12 January 2010  Although the exact number was difficult to determine  the highest reliable death count was estimated at 220 000  8  Haitian government estimates were higher  9  The Presidential palace  Parliament and many other important structures were destroyed  along with countless homes and businesses  leaving many homeless  The country has yet to recover from the 2010 earthquake  and subsequent incidents  due  largely  to both the severity of the damage Haiti endured in 2010  as well as to public reliance on a government that was volatile well before the 2010 earthquake  10  United States aid organizations have donated  2 billion  Combined with other international donations  these funds are intended to contribute to the rebuilding of the country  11  Contents 1 History 1 1 Precolonial and Spanish colonial periods 1 2 17th century settlement 1 3 Treaty of Ryswick and French colony  1697  1 4 Revolution  1791  1 5

 Precolonial and Spanish colonial periods The island of Hispaniola  of which Haiti occupies the western third  is one of many Caribbean islands inhabited at the time of European arrival by the Ta no Indians  speakers of an Arawakan language  The Ta no name for the entire island was either Ayiti or Kiskeya  In the Ta no societies of the Caribbean Islands  the largest unit of political organization was led by a cacique  hence the term  caciquedom   French caciquat  Spanish cacicazgo  for these Ta no polities  which are often called  chiefdoms   Before the arrival of Christopher Columbus  the island of Hispaniola was divided among five or six long established caciquedoms  12  13  The five caciquedoms of Hispaniola at the time of the arrival of Christopher Columbus  The modern country of Haiti spans most of the territory of the caciquedoms of Xaragua   Jaragua  in modern Spanish  and Marien  The caciquedoms were tributary kingdoms  with payment consisting of harvests  Ta no cultural artifacts include cave paintings in several locations in the country  which have become national symbols of Haiti and tourist attractions  Modern day L ogane  a town in the southwest  is at the site of Xaragua s former capital  Christopher Columbus landed at M le Saint Nicolas on 5 December 1492  and claimed the island for Spain  Nineteen days later  his ship the Santa Mar a ran aground near the present site of Cap Ha tien  Columbus was forced to leave behind 39 men  founding the settlement of La Navidad  Following the destruction of La Navidad by the local indigenous people  Columbus moved to the eastern side of the island and established La Isabela  One of the earliest leaders to fight off Spanish conquest was Queen Anacaona  a princess of Xaragua who married Caonabo  the cacique of Maguana  The couple resisted Spanish rule in vain  she was captured by the Spanish and executed in front of her people  To this day  Queen Anacaona is revered in Haiti as one of the country s founders  1510 pictograph telling a story of missionaries arriving in Hispaniola The Spanish exploited the island for its gold  mined chiefly by local Amerindians directed by the Spanish occupiers  Those refusing to work in the mines were killed or sold into slavery  Europeans brought with them infectious diseases that were new to the Caribbean  to which the indigenous population lacked immunity  These new diseases were the chief cause of the dying off of the Ta no  14  but ill treatment  malnutrition  and a drastic drop in the birthrate as a result of societal disruption also contributed  The first recorded smallpox outbreak in the Americas occurred on Hispaniola in 1507  15  The Laws of Burgos  1512 1513  were the first nationally codified set of laws governing the behavior of Spanish settlers in America  particularly with regards to native Indians  They forbade the maltreatment of natives  endorsed their conversion to Catholicism  16  and legalized the colonial practice of creating encomiendas  where Indians were grouped together to work under colonial masters  17  The Spanish crown found it difficult to enforce these laws in a distant colony  The Spanish governors began importing enslaved Africans for labor  In 1517  Charles V authorized the draft of slaves  The Ta no people became virtually  but not completely  extinct on the island of Hispaniola  Some who evaded capture fled to the mountains and established independent settlements  Survivors mixed with escaped African slaves  runaways called maroons  and produced a multiracial generation the Spanish called zambos  They used the term mestizo for children born of relationships between native women and European   usually Spanish   men  The French settlers later called people of mixed African and Amerindian ancestry marabou  During French rule  children of mixed race  usually born of unions between African women and European men  were called mul tres  Fran ois l Olonnais was nicknamed  Flail of the Spaniards  and had a reputation for brutality   offering no quarter to Spanish prisoners As a gateway to the Caribbean  Hispaniola became a haven for pirates  The western part of the island was settled by French buccaneers  Among them was Bertrand d Ogeron  who succeeded in growing tobacco  His success prompted many of the numerous buccaneers and freebooters to turn into settlers  This population did not submit to Spanish royal authority until the year 1660 and caused a number of conflicts  By 1640  the buccaneers of Tortuga were calling themselves the Brethren of the Coast   edit  17th century settlement Bertrand d Orgeron attracted many French colonial families from Martinique and Guadeloupe  such as those of Jean Roy  1625 1707  Jean Hebert  1624  Guillaume Barre  1642  They and others were driven from their lands when more land was needed for the extension of the sugar plantations  From 1670 to 1690  a drop in the tobacco markets significantly reduced the number of settlers on the island  The first windmill for processing sugar was built in 1685   edit  Treaty of Ryswick and French colony  1697  France and Spain settled hostilities on the island by the Treaty of Ryswick of 1697  which divided Hispaniola between them  France received the western third and subsequently named it Saint Domingue   The current Santo Domingo is in the Dominican Republic and was part of the eastern side given to the Spanish through the treaty   Many French colonists soon arrived and established plantations in Saint Domingue due to high profit potential from agricultural development  They developed large sugar cane plantations  especially  but also devoted land to the cultivation of coffee and indigo  The colonists imported slaves from Africa to work in the labor intensive cultivation and processing of the commodity crops  and Saint Domingue became a slave society  dependent on slavery as the basis of its economy  By 1789  there were approximately 40 000 French immigrants on the western part of the island  18  In contrast  by 1763 the French population of Canada numbered only 65 000  19  The ethnic French were vastly outnumbered by the slaves they had imported  of whom there were nearly ten times that number  The largest sugar plantations and concentrations of slaves were in the north of the island  By about 1790  Saint Domingue had greatly overshadowed its eastern counterpart in terms of wealth and population  It quickly became the richest French colony in the New World due to the immense profits from the sugar  coffee and indigo industries  all based on slave labor and satisfying international demand for the crops  The French enacted Code Noir   Black Code    prepared by Jean Baptiste Colbert and ratified by Louis XIV  had established rules on slave treatment and permissible freedoms  Saint Domingue has been described as one of the most brutally efficient slave colonies  one third of newly imported Africans died within a few years  20  Under the harsh regime  slaves failed to have children  some women were suspected of abortions and infanticide to keep children from growing up in slavery  Under these conditions  French men often took sexual advantage of African women  A population of mixed race people resulted  in some cases  the French fathers provided for their children  especially boys  including sending them to France for education  They also freed their mothers and the children  and gradually a class of free people of color  gens du couleur libre  developed  with certain rights  They tended to become artisans  shopkeepers and tradesmen  and more often lived in the towns of the southwest  especially Port au Prince  the main city  Generally growing up Catholic and speaking French  the gens du couleur libre became educated and struggled to become independent property owners  They were a class apart from the black slaves  who especially in the North kept more African traditions  due to the continual renewal of their numbers by fresh slaves from Africa   edit  Revolution  1791  Main article  Haitian Revolution Burning of the town of Cap Francais Jean Jacques Dessalines  leader of the Haitian Revolution and the first ruler of an independent Haiti Inspired by the French Revolution and principles of the rights of men  free people of colour and slaves in Saint Domingue and the French and West Indies pressed for freedom and more civil rights  Most important was the revolution of the slaves in Saint Domingue  starting in the heavily African majority northern plains in 1791  In 1792  the French government sent three commissioners with troops to reestablish control  They began to build an alliance with the free people of colour who wanted more civil rights  In 1793  France and Great Britain went to war  and British troops invaded Saint Domingue  The execution of Louis XVI heightened tensions in the colony  To build an alliance with the gens de couleur and slaves  the French commissioners Sonthonax and Polverel abolished slavery in the colony  Six months later  the National Convention led by Robespierre and the Jacobins endorsed abolition and extended it to all the French colonies  21  Toussaint Louverture  a former slave and leader in the slave revolt a man who rose in importance as a military commander because of his many skills achieved peace in 1794 in Saint Domingue after years of war against both external invaders and internal dissension  Having established a disciplined  flexible army  Louverture drove out not only the Spanish but also the British invaders who threatened the colony  He restored stability and prosperity by daring measures that included inviting planters to return and insisting freed men work on plantations to renew revenues for the island  He also renewed trading ties with Great Britain and the United States  In the uncertain years of revolution  the United States played both sides  with traders supplying both the French and the rebels  22   edit  Independence and Division  1804  When the French government changed  new members of the national legislature   lobbied by planters   began to rethink their decisions on colonial slavery  After Toussaint Louverture created a separatist constitution  Napol on Bonaparte sent an expedition of 20 000 men under the command of his brother in law  General Charles Leclerc  to retake the island  Leclerc s mission was to oust Louverture and restore slavery  The French achieved some victories  but within a few months  yellow fever had killed most of the French soldiers  23  More than 50 000 French troops died in an attempt to retake colony  including 18 generals  24  Leclerc invited Toussaint Louverture to a parley  kidnapped him and sent him to France  where he was imprisoned at Fort de Joux  He died there in 1803 of exposure and tuberculosis 20  or malnutrition and pneumonia  Battle between Polish troops in French service and the Haitian rebels  Some Polish soldiers ultimately fought with the Haitian rebels for reasons that are historically disputable  25  not in citation given  Slaves  along with free gens de couleur and allies continued their fight for independence after the French transported Louverture to France  The native leader Jean Jacques Dessalines   long an ally and general of Toussaint Louverture  brilliant strategist and soldier   defeated French troops led by Donatien Marie Joseph de Vimeur  vicomte de Rochambeau  at the Battle of Verti res  At the end of the double battle for emancipation and independence  former slaves proclaimed the independence of Saint Domingue on 1 January 1804  26  declaring the new nation be named  Ayiti   both a Native American and African term  meaning  home or mother of the earth  in the Taino Arawak Native American language and  sacred earth or homeland  in the Fon African language  to honor one of the indigenous Ta no names for the island  Haiti is the only nation born of a slave revolt  Haiti s perseverance and successful resistance against colonial forces would influence the future of the United States Civil War  20  Historians have estimated the slave rebellion resulted in the death of 100 000 blacks and 24 000 of the 40 000 white colonists  27  In February 2010  the eight page document containing the official Declaration of Independence  which was believed to have been destroyed or thrown out  was found by a Canadian graduate student from Duke University in Britain s National Archives  Coming as it did soon after the 2010 devastating earthquake  the discovery is seen by many to be providential  28  The revolution in Saint Domingue unleashed a massive multiracial exodus  French Cr ole colonists fled with those slaves they still held  as did numerous free people of color  some of whom were also slaveholders and transported slaves with them  29  In 1809  nearly 10 000 refugees from Saint Domingue arrived from Cuba  where they had first fled  to settle en masse in New Orleans  30  They doubled that city s population and helped preserve its French language and culture for several generations  In addition  the newly arrived slaves added to the city s African and multiracial culture  31  Dessalines was proclaimed  Emperor for Life  by his troops  32  He exiled or killed the remaining whites and ruled as a despot  33  In the continuing competition for power  he was assassinated on 17 October 1806  26  The country was then divided between a kingdom in the north directed by Henri I  and a republic in the south directed by Alexandre P tion  an homme de couleur  Henri I is best known for constructing the Citadelle Laferri re  the largest fortress in the Western Hemisphere  to defend the island against the French  Despite opposition from the mulatto populace  Henri Christophe successfully united Northern Haiti for a period of time under a semi feudal corv e system  establishing a rigid education and economic code aimed at sustainable improvement for all Haitians  34  In 1815  Sim n Bol var  the South American political leader who was instrumental in Latin America s struggle for independence from Spain  received military and financial assistance from Haiti  Bol var had fled to Haiti after an attempt had been made on his life in Jamaica  where he had unsuccessfully sought support for his efforts  In 1817  on condition that Bol var free any enslaved people he encountered in his fight for South American independence  Haitian president Alexandre P tion provided Bol var with soldiers  weapons and financial assistance  which were critical in enabling him to liberate the Viceroyalty of New Granada  Now Colombia  Ecuador  Panama and Venezuela   35   edit  Reunification Jean Pierre Boyer  one of the leaders of the Haitian Revolution  and President of Haiti from 1818 to 1843 Beginning in 1821  President Jean Pierre Boyer  also an homme de couleur and successor to P tion  managed to reunify the two parts of St  Domingue and extend control over the western part of the island  36  In addition  after Santo Domingo declared its independence from Spain  Boyer sent forces in to take control  Boyer then ruled the entire island  37  According to Encyclop dia Britannica   During his presidency  Boyer tried to halt the downward trend of the economy   which had begun with the successful revolt of black slaves against their French masters in the 1790s   by passing the Code Rural  Its provisions sought to tie the peasant labourers to plantation land by denying them the right to leave the land  enter the towns  or start farms or shops of their own and by creating a rural constabulary to enforce the code   38  39  During Boyer s administration  his government negotiated with Loring D  Dewey  an agent of the American Colonization Society  ACS   to encourage free blacks from the United States to emigrate to Haiti  They hoped to gain people with skills to contribute to the independent nation  In the early 19th century  the ACS   an uneasy blend of abolitionists and slaveholders   proposed resettlement of American free blacks to other countries  primarily to a colony in Liberia  as a solution to problems of racism in the US  Starting in September 1824  more than 6 000 American free blacks migrated to Haiti  with transportation paid by the ACS  40  Due to the poverty and other difficult conditions there  many returned to the US within a short time  In July 1825  King Charles X of France sent a fleet of 14 vessels and thousands of troops to reconquer the island  Under pressure  President Boyer agreed to a treaty by which France formally recognized the independence of the nation in exchange for a payment of 150 million francs  reduced to 90 million in 1838    an indemnity for profits lost from the slave trade  French abolitionist Victor Schoelcher wrote   Imposing an indemnity on the victorious slaves was equivalent to making them pay with money that which they had already paid with their blood   After losing the support of Haiti s elite  Boyer was ousted in 1843  A long succession of coups followed his departure to exile  National authority was disputed by factions of

supported suppression of the reform movement of Ant nor Firmin  citation needed  In January 1914  British  German and US forces entered Haiti  ostensibly to protect their citizens from civil unrest  41   edit  United States occupation of Haiti  1915 1934  In an expression of the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine  the United States occupied the island in 1915 and US Marines were stationed in the country until 1934  According to Monroe  treaties in 1915 and 1917 gave the U S  State and Navy departments  and the Navy s Marine Corps  effective control over key government roles  the U S  assumed responsibility for maintaining domestic peace and put down several small rebellions such as the  Cacos  uprising  Haiti had huge debts  which were refinanced by new loans from the National City Bank of New York  and paid off by American government officials who took control of customs and the national budget  The U S  transformed the Garde into a modern police force and built up advanced public health  education  ports and roads  According to Paul Farmer  the US administration dismantled the constitutional system  reinstituted virtual slavery for building roads  and established the National Guards that ran the country by violence and terror after the Marines left  41  dubious   discuss  It also made massive improvements to infrastructure  1 700 kilometres  1 100 mi  of roads were made usable  189 bridges were built  many irrigation canals were rehabilitated hospitals  schools  and public buildings were constructed  and drinking water was brought to the main cities  citation needed Sisal was introduced to Haiti  and sugar and cotton became significant exports  43  The U S  Marines supervised the operations of a client Haitian government  and emphasized American style modernization of the infrastructure and universal education  Haitian traditionalists were highly resistant to these changes while the urban elites wanted more control  Together they helped force an end to the occupation in 1934  44  President Herbert Hoover sent a commission that set up a plan of withdrawal that was achieved under President Franklin D  Roosevelt  The first step was a gradual  systematic turnover of government functions to the Haitian government  in 1934 it took control of the Garde and the Marines departed  The debts were still outstanding and the American financial advisor general receiver handled the budget until 1941  45  In 1915  Philippe Sudr  Dartiguenave was elected president  He was succeeded by Louis Borno in the 1922 elections  Borno worked closely with the Americans  Aware that many Haitians did not speak French  he was the first president to authorize the use of Creole in the education system  Sisal fiber cultivation was introduced to Haiti  and sugar and cotton became significant exports  46  Recognition of the distinctive traditionalism of the Haitian people had a sharp impact on black writers in the U S   as well as white writers exploring black themes   including Eugene O Neill  James Weldon Johnson  Langston Hughes  Zora Neale Hurston and Orson Welles  47   edit  End of US occupation until election of Duvalier  1934 1956  The US occupation forces established a boundary between Haiti and the Dominican Republic by taking disputed land from the latter  After the US left in 1934  Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo   in an event known as the Parsley Massacre   ordered his Army to kill Haitians living on the Dominican side of the border  48  49  In a  three day genocidal spree   he murdered between 10 000 and 20 000 Haitians  48  He then developed a uniquely Dominican policy of racial discrimination  Antihaitianismo   anti Haitianism    targeting the mostly black inhabitants of his neighboring country  St nio Vincent was succeeded as President in 1941 by  lie Lescot  In 1949  Lescot tried to change the constitution to allow for his own reelection  but in 1950 this triggered another coup  General Paul Magloire led the country until December 1956  when he was forced to resign by a general strike  After a period of disorder  an election held in September 1957 saw Dr  Fran ois Duvalier elected President   edit  Duvalier family dictatorship  1957 1986  From 1957 to 1986 Haiti was governed by the hereditary dictatorship of the Duvalier family  Former minister of health and labor Fran ois Duvalier  known as  Papa Doc  and initially popular among the blacks  clarification needed  was the President of Haiti from 1957 until his death in 1971  A strong believer in the rights of the Haitian black majority  he advanced black interests in the public sector  50  He stayed in power by enlisting an organization known as Tontons Macoutes   Bogeymen    which maintained order by terrorizing the populace  51  In the 1960s and 1970s  Haiti s diaspora made vital contributions to the establishment of francophone Africa s newly independent countries as Haiti s university professors  medical doctors  administrators and development specialists emigrated to these countries  citation needed   Papa Doc  was succeeded by his son  born 3 July 1951  Jean Claude Duvalier   known also as  B b  Doc    who led the country from 1971 until his ouster in 1986  In 1986  protests against  Baby Doc  led him to seek exile in France  Army leader General Henri Namphy headed a new National Governing Council  52  In March 1987  a new constitution was overwhelmingly approved by Haiti s population  General elections in November were aborted after dozens of inhabitants were shot in the capital by soldiers and Tontons Macoutes  and scores more were massacred around the country  Fraudulent military controlled elections followed  boycotted by opposition candidates  and the elected President  Leslie Manigat  was overthrown some months later in the June 1988 Haitian coup d  tat when he sought to assert his constitutional control over the military  The September 1988 Haitian coup d  tat followed after the St Jean Bosco massacre brought to the fore the increasing prominence of former Tontons Macoutes  and General Prosper Avril led a military regime until March 1990  Throughout the late 1980s and into the 1990s  leading members of the military  intelligence and police were involved in the illegal drug trade in Haiti  assisting Colombian drug traffickers smuggling drugs into the United States  citation needed   edit  Aristide s presidency  1990s  In December 1990  the former priest Jean Bertrand Aristide was elected President in the Haitian general election  winning more than two thirds of the vote  His 5 year mandate began on 7 February 1991  having survived a coup attempt even before his inauguration  when former Tonton Macoute leader Roger Lafontant seized the provisional President Ertha Pascal Trouillot and declared himself President  After large numbers of Aristide supporters filled the streets in protest and Lafontant attempted to declare martial law  the Army crushed the incipient coup  During Aristide s short lived first period in office  he attempted to carry out substantial reforms  which brought passionate opposition from Haiti s business and military elite  His relationship with the National Assembly soon deteriorated  partly over his selection of his friend Ren  Pr val as Prime Minister  In September  Aristide was overthrown in the 1991 Haitian coup d  tat  led by Army General Raoul C dras  and flown into exile  Elections were scheduled  but then cancelled  The Organization of American States condemned the coup  and the United Nations set up a trade embargo  A campaign of terror against Aristide supporters was started by Emmanuel Constant  In 1993  Constant  who had been on the U S  Central Intelligence Agency s payroll as an informant since 1992  organized the Front for the Advancement and Progress of Ha ti  FRAPH   which targeted and killed an estimated 5000 Aristide supporters  In 1994  an American team  under the direction of the Clinton Administration  successfully negotiated the departure of Haiti s military leaders and the peaceful entry of US forces under Operation Uphold Democracy  thereby paving the way for the restoration of Jean Bertrand Aristide as president  53  In October 1994  Aristide returned to Haiti to complete his term in office  54  Aristide disbanded the Haitian army  and established a civilian police force  Aristide vacated the presidency in February 1996  the scheduled end of his 5 year term based on the date of his inauguration  In the 1995 election  Ren  Pr val was elected as president for a five year term  winning 88  of the popular vote  Pr val had previously served as Aristide s Prime Minister from February to October 1991   edit  21st century See also  2004 Haitian coup d etat  United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti  and 2010 Haiti earthquake The November 2000 election gave the presidency back to Aristide with an overwhelming 92  of the vote  55  The election had been boycotted by the opposition  now organised into the Convergence D mocratique  over a dispute in the May legislative elections  In subsequent years  there was increasing violence and human rights abuses  Aristide supporters attacked the opposition  56  Aristide spent years negotiating with the Convergence D mocratique on new elections  but the Convergence s inability to develop a sufficient electoral base made elections unattractive  In 2004  a revolt began in northern Haiti  The rebellion eventually reached the capital  and Aristide was forced into exile  whereupon the United Nations stationed peacekeepers in Haiti  Much evidence points to a key U S  role in Aristide s ouster  with Aristide and his bodyguard  Franz Gabriel  claiming that he was the victim of a  new coup d  tat or modern kidnapping  by U S  forces  Mrs  Aristide stated that the kidnappers wore US Special Forces uniforms  but changed into civilian clothes upon boarding the aircraft that was used to remove Aristide from Haiti  57  58 Boniface Alexandre assumed interim authority  Ren  Pr val was elected President in February 2006  following elections marked by uncertainties and popular demonstrations  The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti  also known as MINUSTAH  remains in the country  having been there since the 2004 Haitian coup d etat  The United States led a vast international campaign to prevent Aristide from returning to his country while he was exiled in South Africa  Released Wikileaks cables show that high level U S  and U N  officials coordinated a politically motivated prosecution of Aristide to prevent him from  gaining more traction with the Haitian population and returning to Haiti   The United States and its allies allegedly poured tens of millions of dollars into unsuccessful efforts to slander Aristide as a drug trafficker  human rights violator  and heretical practitioner of voodoo  59  Mich le Pierre Louis 60  61  was the second female Prime

abated  Government agencies were also hard hit  Two days afterwards thousands of U S  troops arrived to aid in the earthquake relief effort 64  and relief agencies are playing a large role in rebuilding Haiti s infrastructure  while taking care of the short term emergency needs of the many injured and displaced Haitians  65  In October 2010 a cholera epidemic was identified  a disease thought to be accidentally introduced by aid workers from abroad  More than 3 500 people in a region to the north of Port au Prince were treated for diarrhea  acute fever  vomiting  and severe dehydration  There were fears the outbreak would reach camps housing survivors of the earthquake  There were initial protests against the U N  peacekeeping forces because of their suspected role in introducing cholera  These led to violent attacks on 15 November 2010  The cholera outbreak had  at that point  killed around 900 people  and sickened around 15 000  66  Many Haitian people alleged that the strain may have come from the Nepalese peacekeepers  who have a base on the Artibonite river  but the U N  did not want the Haitian people to come to conclusions and blame the Nepalese based on  misinformation   67  The last cholera outbreak in Haiti was forty years ago  68  and  The U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the cholera strain now ravaging the country matched a strain specific to South Asia  but said they had not pinpointed its origin or how it arrived in Haiti   67  69  General elections had been planned for January 2010  but were postponed due to the earthquake  The elections were held on 28 November 2010 for senate  parliament and the first round of the presidential elections  The run off between Michel Martelly and Mirlande Manigat took place on 20 March 2011  and preliminary results  released on 4 April  named Michel Martelly the winner  70   edit  Geography Map of Haiti Main article  Geography of Haiti Haiti is on the western part of Hispaniola  the second largest island in the Greater Antilles  Haiti is the third largest country in the Caribbean behind Cuba and the Dominican Republic  the latter shares a 360 kilometre  224 mi  border with Haiti   Haiti at its closest point is only about 45 nautical miles  83 km  52 mi  away from Cuba and has the second longest coastline  1 771 km 1 100 mi  in the Greater Antilles  Cuba having the longest  The country lies mostly between latitudes 18  and 20 N  Tortuga island lies just north of 20    and longitudes 71  and 75 W  Haiti s terrain consists mainly of rugged mountains interspersed with small coastal plains and river valleys  The northern region consists of the Massif du Nord  Northern Massif  and the Plaine du Nord  Northern Plain   The Massif du Nord is an extension of the Cordillera Central in the Dominican Republic  It begins at Haiti s eastern border  north of the Guayamouc River  and extends to the northwest through the northern peninsula  The lowlands of the Plaine du Nord lie along the northern border with the Dominican Republic  between the Massif du Nord and the North Atlantic Ocean  The central region consists of two plains and two sets of mountain ranges  The Plateau Central  Central Plateau  extends along both sides of the Guayamouc River  south of the Massif du Nord  It runs from the southeast to the northwest  To the southwest of the Plateau Central are the Montagnes Noires  whose most northwestern part merges with the Massif du Nord  Its westernmost point is known as Cap Carcasse  The southern region consists of the Plaine du Cul de Sac  the southeast  and the mountainous southern peninsula  also known as the Tiburon Peninsula   The Plaine du Cul de Sac is a natural depression that harbors the country s saline lakes  such as Trou Ca man and Haiti s largest lake  Lac Azu i  The Cha ne de la Selle mountain range   an extension of the southern mountain chain of the Dominican Republic  the Sierra de Baoruco    extends from the Massif de la Selle in the east to the Massif de la Hotte in the west  This mountain range harbors Pic la Selle  the highest point in Haiti at 2 680 metres  8 793 ft    71  The country s most important valley in terms of crops is the Plaine de l Artibonite  which is oriented south of the Montagnes Noires  This region supports the country s  also Hispaniola s  longest river  the Riviere l Artibonite  which begins in the western region of the Dominican Republic and continues most of its length through central Haiti and onward where it empties into the Golfe de la Gon ve  The eastern and central region of the island is a large elevated plateau  Haiti also includes various offshore islands  The historically famous island of Tortuga   le de la Tortue  is located off the coast of northern Haiti  The arrondissement of La Gon ve is located on the island of the same name  in the Golfe de la Gon ve  Gon ve Island is moderately populated by rural villagers   le

Dominican Republic  right  shows the amount of deforestation on the Haitian side  edit  Environment Main articles  Environment of Haiti and Deforestation in Haiti In 1925  Haiti was lush  with 60  of its original forest covering the lands and mountainous regions  Since then  the population has cut down an estimated 98  of its original forest cover for use as fuel for cookstoves  and in the process has destroyed fertile farmland soils  contributing to desertification  73  In addition to soil erosion  deforestation has caused periodic flooding  as seen on 17 September 2004  Earlier that year in May  floods had killed over 3 000 people on Haiti s southern border with the Dominican Republic  74  There has been little marine  coastal  and river basin management  Forest cover in the steep hills surrounding Haiti s river basin retains soil  which in turn retains water from rainfall  reducing river flood peaks and conserving flows in the dry season  But deforestation has resulted in much of the soil being released from the upper catchments  Many of Haiti s rivers are now highly unstable  changing rapidly from destructive flooding to inadequate flows  75  Scientists at the Columbia University s Center for International Earth Science Information Network  CIESIN  76  and the United Nations Environment Programme are working on the Haiti Regenerative Initiative 77  an initiative aiming to reduce poverty and natural disaster vulnerability in Haiti through ecosystem restoration and sustainable resource management   edit  Natural disasters  edit  Hurricanes and tropical storms In 2004  Tropical Storm Jeanne skimmed the north coast of Haiti  leaving 3 006 people dead in flooding and mudslides  mostly in the city of Gona ves  78  Haiti was again pummeled by tropical storms in late August and early September 2008  The storms   Tropical Storm Fay  Hurricane Gustav  Hurricane Hanna and Hurricane Ike   all produced heavy winds and rain in Haiti  Due to weak soil conditions throughout Haiti  the country s mountainous terrain  and the devastating coincidence of four storms within less than four weeks  valley and lowland areas throughout the country experienced massive flooding  Casualties proved difficult to count because the storm diminished human capacity and physical resources for such record keeping  Bodies continued to surface as the flood waters receded  A 10 September 2008 source listed 331 dead and 800 000 in need of humanitarian aid  79  The grim state of affairs produced by these storms was all the more life threatening due to already high food and fuel prices that had caused a food crisis and political unrest in April 2008  80   edit  2010 earthquake Main article  2010 Haiti earthquake The National Palace  after the 12 January 2010 earthquake A

200 years  81  The epicenter of the quake was just outside the Haitian capital Port au Prince  82  On 10 February the Haitian government gave a death toll of 230 000  9  Widespread damage resulted from the quake  and the capital city was devastated  The Presidential Palace was badly damaged  the second floor collapsing onto the first floor  the Haitian Parliament building  UN mission headquarters and the National Cathedral were also destroyed  International aid flowed in but was hampered by damaged infrastructure  the main port was damaged beyond immediate use  the one local airport was of limited capacity  and border crossings with the Dominican Republic were distant and crowded  As many as one million Haitians were left homeless  83  Haiti will need to be completely rebuilt from the ground up  according to a journalist  as   e ven in good times  Haiti is an economic wreck  balancing precariously on the razor s edge of calamity   84  Several international appeals were launched within days of the earthquake  including the Disasters Emergency Committee in the United Kingdom  Young Artists for Haiti  Canada  and Hope for Haiti Now  A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief based in the USA  which was a global effort to raise relief funds by way of a charity telethon held on 22 January 2010  International officials are looking at the short and long term priorities while continuing the daily task of managing the emergency situation  85  As of September 2010  there were over one million refugees living in tents and the humanitarian situation was characterized as still being in the emergency phase  86  On 31 May 2011  BBC News reported that a new report challenges Haiti s official earthquake death toll   Significantly fewer people died or were left homeless by last year s earthquake in Haiti than claimed by the country s leaders  a draft report commissioned by the US government has said  The unpublished report puts the death toll between 46 000 and 85 000   Haiti s government says about 316 000 died   It also suggests many of those still living in tent cities did not lose their homes in the disaster  The draft report  which has yet to be released

majority party in the National Assembly  Executive power is exercised by the President and Prime Minister who together constitute the government  Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of the National Assembly of Haiti  The government is organized unitarily  thus the central government delegates powers to the departments without a constitutional need for consent  The current structure of Haiti s political system was set forth in the Constitution of Haiti on 29 March 1987  The current president is Michel Martelly  In 2010  there were 7 000 people in the Haitian

contentious  in its 200 year history  Haiti has suffered 32 coups  104  Haiti s is the only country in the Western Hemisphere to undergo a successful slave revolution  but a long history of oppression by dictators   including Fran ois Duvalier and his son Jean Claude Duvalier   has markedly affected the nation  France and the United States have repeatedly intervened in Haitian politics since the country s founding  sometimes at the request of one party or another  According to a Corruption Perceptions Index report in 2006  there is a strong correlation between corruption and poverty and Haiti ranked first of all countries surveyed for of levels of perceived domestic corruption  105  The International Red Cross reports that seven out of ten Haitians live on less than US 2 a day  106  Cit  Soleil  Haiti s largest slum in the capital of Port au Prince  has been called  the most dangerous place on Earth  by the United Nations  107  The slum is a stronghold of supporters of former Haitian President Jean Bertrand Aristide  108  who  according to the BBC   accused the US of forcing him out   an accusation the US rejected as  absurd    109  Jean Claude Duvalier suddenly returned to Haiti in late January 2011  claiming his doing so was out of concern for the present situation in Haiti  On the other hand  Jean Bertrand Aristide was initially denied access to Haiti by Haitian immigration authorities  despite issuing appeals to his supporters  and to international observers  to be able to do so  The world s most prominent governments did not overtly oppose such appeals  nor did they support them  an unnamed analyst  close to the Haitian government  who was repeatedly quoted in several media sources including the New York Times  is reported to have commented   Aristide could have 15 passports and he s still not going to come back to Haiti     France and the United States are standing in the way   However  Aristide finally returned to Haiti just days before the 2011

2010  Its purchasing power parity GDP fell 8  in 2010  from  12 15 billion to  11 18 billion  and the GDP per capita remained unchanged at  PPP US   1 200  2  Comparative social and economic indicators show Haiti falling behind other low income developing countries  particularly in the hemisphere  since the 1980s  Haiti ranked 145 of 182 countries in the 2010 United Nations Human Development Index  with 57 3  of the population being deprived in at least three of the HDI s poverty measures  5  The World Factbook reports a shortage of skilled labor  widespread unemployment and underemployment  saying  more than two thirds of the labor force do not have formal jobs   and describes pre earthquake Haiti as  already the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere with 80  of the population living under the poverty line and 54  in abject poverty   2  Most Haitians live on  2 or less per day  113  Adult literacy is variously reported as 52 9   World Factbook  and 65 3   United Nations   and the World Bank estimates that in 2004 over 80  of college graduates from Haiti were living abroad  with their remittances home representing 52 7  of Haiti s GDP  114 Cit  Soleil is considered one of the worst slums in the Americas  115  most of its 500 000 residents live in extreme poverty  107  Poverty has forced at least 225 000 Haitian children to work as restavecs  unpaid household servants   the United Nations considers this to be a modern day form of slavery  116  About 66  of all Haitians work in the agricultural sector  which consists mainly of small scale subsistence farming  but this activity makes up only 30  of the GDP  The country has experienced little formal job creation over the past decade  although the informal economy is growing  Mangoes and coffee are two of Haiti s most important exports  2  Natural resources of Haiti include bauxite  copper  calcium carbonate  gold  marble and hydropower  Haiti contains relatively small amounts of gold  silver  antimony  tin  lignite  sulphur  coal  nickel  gypsum  limestone  manganese  marble  iron  tungsten  salt  clay  and various building stones  Gold and copper are found in small quantities in the north of the country  The government announced the discovery of new gold deposits in the northern peninsula in 1985  but long standing plans for gold production proceeded slowly  Copper also was mined  beginning in the 1960s  but production of the ore was sporadic  There are bauxite  aluminum ore  deposits on the southern peninsula  but large scale mining there was discontinued in 1983  The country s only bauxite mine  the Mirago ne mine in the southern peninsula  produced an average of 500 000 tons of bauxite a year in the early 1980s  however  in 1982 the declining metal content of the ore  high production costs  and the oversupplied international bauxite market forced the mine to close  Bauxite had at one time been the country s second leading export  Haiti apparently has no hydrocarbon resources on land or in the Gulf of Gon ve and is therefore heavily dependent on energy imports  petroleum and petroleum products   117  Haiti s richest 1  own nearly half the country s wealth  118  Haiti has consistently ranked among the most corrupt countries in the world on the Corruption Perceptions Index  119  Since the day of  Papa Doc  Duvalier  Haiti s government has been notorious for its corruption  It is estimated that President  Baby Doc  Duvalier  his wife Michelle  and three other people took  504 million from the Haitian public treasury between 1971 and 1986  120  Similarly  some media outlets alleged that millions were stolen by former president Jean Bertrand Aristide  121  122  123  124  However the accuracy of the information is questionable and may have been concocted to discredit Aristide  In March 2004  at the time of Aristide s being kidnapped  a BBC article wrote that the Bush administration State department claimed that Aristide had been involved in drug trafficking  125  The BBC also described pyramid schemes  in which Haitians lost hundreds of millions in 2002  as the  only real economic initiative  of the Aristide years  126  However this cannot necessarily be entirely blamed on Aristide since one of his conditions upon being returned to Haiti by the Clinton administration during the 90s was that he not stir the pot away from US Free Market Trade Policies  127  Clinton recently expressed regret and apologized for the US s trade policies with Haiti 128  Aristide however decided against being further tied to the free market policies that he was restricted to  and he attempted to raise the country s minimum wage  Foreign aid makes up approximately 30 40  of the national government s budget  The largest donor is the US  followed by Canada and the European Union  129  From 1990 to 2003  Haiti received more than  4 billion in aid  The United States alone had provided Haiti with 1 5 billion in aid  130  Venezuela and Cuba also make various contributions to Haiti s economy  especially after alliances were renewed in 2006 and 2007  In January 2010  China promised  4 2 million for the quake hit island  131  US President Barack Obama pledged  1 15 billion in assistance  132 European Union nations promised more than 400 million euros   616 million  in emergency aid and reconstruction funds  133  US aid to the Haitian government was completely cut off from 2001 to 2004  after the 2000 election was disputed and President Aristide was accused of various misdeeds  134  After Aristide s departure in 2004  aid was restored  and the Brazilian army led the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti peacekeeping operation  Following almost 4 years of recession ending in 2004  the economy grew by 1 5  in 2005  135  In 2005 Haiti s total external debt reached an estimated US 1 3 billion  which corresponds to a debt per capita of US 169  In September 2009  Haiti met the conditions set out by the IMF and World Bank s Heavily Indebted Poor Countries program to qualify for cancellation of its external debt  136   edit  Infrastructure  edit  Roadways Main article  Transport in Haiti Haiti has two main highways that run from one end of the country to the other  The northern highway  Route Nationale No  1  National Highway One   originates in Port au Prince  winding through the coastal towns of Montrouis and Gona ves  before reaching its terminus at the northern port Cap Ha tien  The southern highway  Route Nationale No  2  links Port au Prince with Les Cayes via L og ne and Petit Go ve  According to the Washington Post   Officials from the U S  Army Corps of Engineers said Saturday  23 January 2010  that they assessed the damage from the 12 Jan  quake in Port au Prince  Haiti  and found that many of the roads aren t any worse than they were before because they ve always been in poor condition   137   edit  Water The port at Port au Prince  Port international de Port au Prince  has more registered shipping than any of the other dozen ports in the country  The port s facilities include cranes  large berths  and warehouses  but these facilities are not in good condition  The port is underused  possibly due to the substantially high port fees  compared to ports in the Dominican Republic  The port of Saint Marc is currently the preferred port of entry for consumer goods coming into Haiti  Reasons for this may include its location away from volatile and congested Port au Prince  as well as its central location relative to numerous Haitian cities  During the 2010 Earthquake  the Port au Prince port suffered widespread damage  impeding aid to the victims  The main pier caved in and fell into the water  One of the main cranes also collapsed in the water  Port access roads were severely damaged as well   edit  Air Main article  List of airports in Haiti Toussaint Louverture International Airport is located 10 kilometres  6 2 mi  North North East of Port au Prince  It has Haiti s main jetway  and as such  handles the vast majority of the country s international flights  To travel on from the international airport at Port au Prince to other Haitian cities requires boarding a smaller plane  Cities such as Jacmel  J r mie  Les Cayes  Cap Ha tien  and Port de Paix have airports that are accessible only by smaller aircraft  Companies that fly to these airports include  Caribintair  Sunrise Airways and Tortug  Air   edit  Rail Main article  Rail transport in Haiti In the past  Haiti used rail transport  but  today  railroads are no longer in use

meningitis and diarrheal diseases  according to the World Health Organization  139  Ninety percent of Haiti s children suffer from waterborne diseases and intestinal parasites  140  HIV infection is found in 2 2  of Haiti s adult population  141  The incidence of tuberculosis  TB  in Haiti is more than ten times as high as in the rest of Latin America  142  Approximately 30 000 people in Haiti suffer each year from malaria  143  Most people living in Haiti are at high risk for major infectious diseases  Food or waterborne diseases include bacterial and protozoal diarrhea  hepatitis A and E  and typhoid fever  common vectorborne diseases are dengue fever and malaria  water contact diseases include leptospirosis  Roughly 75  of Haitian households lack running water  Unsafe water  along with inadequate housing and unsanitary living conditions  contributes to the high incidence of infectious diseases  There is a chronic shortage of health care personnel  and hospitals lack resources  a situation that became readily apparent after the January 2010 earthquake  144   edit  Education Main article  Education in Haiti The educational system of Haiti is based on the French system  Higher education  under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education  is provided by universities and other public and private institutions  145  Haiti counts 15 200 primary schools  of which 90  are non public and managed by communities  religious organizations or NGOs  146  The enrollment rate for primary school is 67   and fewer than 30  reach 6th grade  Secondary schools enroll 20  of eligible age children  Charity organizations  including Food for the Poor and Haitian Health Foundation  are building schools for children and providing necessary school supplies  Haiti s literacy rate is 52 9   2  The January  2010 earthquake was a major setback for education reform in Haiti  Literacy levels remain near 50 percent  Haiti is one of the lowest ranked countries in the world  177th out of 186  for national spending on education  147  Many reformers have advocated the creation of a free  public and universal education system for all primary school age students in Haiti  The Inter American Development Bank estimates that the government will need at least  3 billion USD to create an adequately funded system  148   edit  Culture Main article  Culture of Haiti  Tap tap  bus in Port Salut  Haiti has a long and storied history and therefore retains a rich culture  Haitian culture is a mixture of primarily French  African elements  and native Ta no  with influence from the colonial Spanish  The country s customs essentially are a blend of cultural beliefs that derived from the various ethnic groups that inhabited the island of Hispaniola  In nearly all aspects of modern Haitian society however  the European and African elements dominate  Haiti is world famous for its distinctive art  notably painting and sculpture  The music of Haiti is influenced mostly by European colonial ties and African migration  through slavery   In the case of European colonization  musical influence has derived primarily from the French  however Haitian music has been influenced to a significant extent by its Spanish speaking neighbors  the Dominican Republic and Cuba  whose Spanish infused music has contributed much to the country s musical genres as well  Styles of music unique to the nation of Haiti include music derived from Voodoo ceremonial traditions  Rara parading music  troubadour ballads  and the wildly popular Compas  149  Compas  in French  or Konpa  in Creole  150  is a complex  ever changing music that arose from African rhythms and European ballroom dancing  mixed with Haiti s bourgeois culture  It is a refined music  played with an underpinning of tipico  and m ringue  related to Dominican merengue  as a basic rhythm  Haiti had no recorded music until 1937 when Jazz Guignard was recorded non commercially  One of the most popular Haitian artists is Wyclef Jean  Wyclef Jean  however  left the country before his teenage years  His music is somewhat hip hop mixed with world music  Brilliant colors  naive perspective and sly humor characterize Haitian art  Frequent subjects in Haitian art include big  delectable foods  lush landscapes  market activities  jungle animals  rituals  dances  and gods  Artists frequently paint in fables  People are disguised as animals and animals are transformed into people  In a mostly illiterate land  symbols take on great meaning  For example  a rooster often represents Aristide and the red and blue colors of the Haitian flag often represent his Lavalas party  Many artists cluster in  schools  of painting  such as the Cap Ha tien school  which features depictions of daily life in the city  the Jacmel School  which reflects the steep mountains and bays of that coastal town  or the Saint Soleil School  which is characterized by abstracted human forms and is heavily influenced by Voodoo symbolism   edit  Cuisine Main article  Cuisine of Haiti Haitian cuisine  The cuisine of Haiti originates from several culinary styles from the various historical ethnic groups that populated the western portion of the island of Hispaniola  namely the French  African  and the Ta no  Haitian cuisine is similar to the rest of the Latin Caribbean  the French and the Spanish speaking countries of the Antilles  however it differs in several ways from its regional counterparts  Its primary influence derive from French cuisine  and African cuisine  with notable derivatives from native Ta no and Spanish culinary technique  Though similar to other cooking styles in the region  it carries a uniqueness native only to the country and an appeal to many visitors to the island  Haitians often use peppers and other strong flavorings  Dishes tend to be seasoned liberally and consequently Haitian cuisine tends to be moderately spicy  not mild and not too hot  In the country  however  many businesses of foreign origin have been established introducing several foreign cuisines into the mainstream culture  Years of adaptation have led to these cuisines  ie  Levantine from Arab migration to Haiti  to merge into Haitian cuisine  Rice and beans in several differing ways are eaten throughout the country regardless of location  becoming a sort of national dish  They form the staple diet  which consists of a lot of starch and is high in carbohydrates  Rural areas  with better access to agricultural products  have a larger variety of choices  One such dish is mais moulu  mayi moulin   which is comparable to cornmeal that can be eaten with sauce aux pois  s s pwa   a bean sauce made from one of many types of beans such as kidney  pinto  or garbanzo beans  or pigeon peas  known in some countries as gandules   Mais moulin can be eaten with fish  often red snapper   or alone depending on personal preference  Some of the many plants used in Haitian dishes include tomato  oregano  cabbage  avocado
