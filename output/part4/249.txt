Island contains four counties  two of which are boroughs of New York City  Queens and Brooklyn   1  and two of which are mainly suburban  Nassau and Suffolk   The term  Long Island  often refers only to Nassau and Suffolk counties in order to differentiate them from New York City  though all four counties on the island are part of the New York metropolitan area  As of the 2010 census  Long Island had a population of 7 568 304  2  making it the most populated island in any U S  state or territory  It is also the 17th most populous island in the world  ahead of Ireland  Jamaica and the Japanese island of Hokkaid   Its population density is 5 402 inhabitants per square mile  2 086  km2   If it were a state  Long Island would rank 13th in population  after Virginia  and first in population density  Both the longest 3  and the largest island in the contiguous United States  Long Island extends 118 miles  190 km  eastward from New York Harbor to Montauk Point  and has a maximum north to south expanse of 23 miles  37 km  between the northern Long Island Sound coast and the southern Atlantic coast  4  With a land area of 1 401 square miles  3 629 km2   Long Island is the 11th largest island in the United States and the 148th largest island in the world   larger than the 1 214 square miles  3 140 km2  of the smallest state  Rhode Island  5  Two of New York City s major airports  LaGuardia Airport and JFK International Airport  are located on Long Island  in Queens  Nine bridges and 13 tunnels  including railway tunnels  connect Brooklyn and Queens  and thus Long Island  to the three other boroughs of New York City  Ferries connect Suffolk County northward across Long Island Sound to the state of Connecticut  Contents 1 Overview 2 Geography 2 1 Geology 2 2 Climate 3

of Long Island contains the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn  Kings County  and Queens  Queens County   The central and eastern portions contain the suburban Nassau and Suffolk counties  However  colloquial usage of the term  Long Island  refers only to Nassau and Suffolk counties  6  The more dense and urban Brooklyn and Queens are not usually referred to as  Long Island   since they are a part of New York City  though before those counties amalgamated into the city  they were often so identified  Nassau County is more developed than Suffolk County  with pockets of rural affluence within the Gold Coast of the North Shore and the Five Towns area on the South Shore  South Shore communities are built along protected wetlands of the main land mass as well as white sand beaches of Outer Barrier Islands fronting on the Atlantic Ocean  Old money from the time of the American Revolutionary War populated the island and still does to this day  amongst many others including recent immigrants  Wealthy Americans and Europeans in the gilded age built lavish country homes on the North Shore of Nassau County  Today  although many of the massive estates have been demolished  many exist in their original state  while others have become parks  arboretums  universities and museums  citation needed  Owing to economic growth and the suburbanization of the metropolitan region after World War II  Nassau was the fastest growing county in the United States from the 1950s to the 1970s  citation needed  Suffolk County remains less congested despite substantial growth in high technology and light manufacturing sectors since 1990  although traffic has been increasing in recent years  citation needed  In its far east sections  Suffolk remains small town rural out east  as in Greenport on the North Fork and some of the outward areas of The Hamptons  although summer tourism swells the population in those areas  Western Suffolk  such as the towns of Huntington and Babylon  are becoming increasingly more populated and are beginning to resemble towns in Nassau  Long Island is geographically part of the Mid Atlantic  however many towns and hamlets along the island s north shore  in western Nassau County and in eastern Suffolk County  such as Oyster Bay  Port Jefferson and Sag Harbor seem to resemble New England towns  citation needed  while many of the towns and hamlets along the south shore  such as Long Beach  Valley Stream  and Babylon seem to resemble Mid Atlantic coastal communities  especially those on the shore between New Jersey and Virginia  citation needed  Many of the towns in Long Island s central region resemble typical suburban towns  with strip malls  traffic clogged avenues and fast food restaurants  citation needed  According to the US Census Bureau s 2008 American Community Survey  Nassau and Suffolk Counties have the 10th and 25th highest median household incomes in the nation  respectively  7  Additionally  Nassau County is the third richest county per capita in New York State  and the 30th richest in the nation  Long Island s Nassau County has the second highest property taxes in the United States  8  Suffolk County has redeveloped North Fork potato fields into a burgeoning wine region  citation needed  The South Fork is known for beach towns  including the world renowned Hamptons  and for Montauk Point  home of Montauk Point Lighthouse at the eastern tip of the island   edit  Geography Main article  Geography of Long Island  edit  Geology NASA Landsat satellite image of Long Island and surrounding areas  Long Island  as part of the Outer Lands region  is formed largely of two spines of glacial moraine  with a large  sandy outwash plain beyond  These moraines consist of gravel and loose rock left behind during the two most recent pulses of Wisconsin glaciation during the Ice Ages some 21 000 years ago  19 000 BC   The northern moraine  which directly abuts the North Shore of Long Island at points  is known as the Harbor Hill moraine  The more southerly moraine  known as the Ronkonkoma moraine  forms the  backbone  of Long Island  it runs primarily through the very center of Long Island  roughly coinciding with the length of the Long Island Expressway  The land to the south of this moraine to the South Shore is the outwash plain of the last glacier  One part of the outwash plain was known as the Hempstead Plains  and this land contained one of the few natural prairies to exist east of the Appalachian Mountains  9  The glaciers melted and receded to the north  resulting in the difference between the North Shore beaches and the South Shore beaches  The North Shore beaches are rocky from the remaining glacial debris  while the South Shore s are crisp  clear  outwash sand  Jayne s Hill  at 401 feet  122 m   is the highest hill along either moraine  another well known summit is Bald Hill in Brookhaven Town  not far from its geographical center at Middle Island  The glaciers also formed Lake Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County and Lake Success in Nassau County  each a deep kettle lake   edit  Climate Long Island has a climate similar to other coastal areas of the Northeastern United States  it has warm  humid summers and cool wet winters  Long Island is classified as humid subtropical by some definitions  The Atlantic Ocean helps bring afternoon sea breezes that temper the heat in the warmer months and limit the frequency and severity of thunderstorms  Long Island has a moderately sunny climate  averaging between 2 400 and 2 800 hours of sunshine annually  10  Average yearly snowfall totals range from approximately 20 to 35 inches  51 to 89 cm   with the north shore and western parts averaging more than the south shore and the east end  In any given winter  however  some parts of the island could see up to 75 inches  190 cm  or more  There are also some very quiet winters  in which most parts of the island could see less than 10 inches  25 cm   Long Island is somewhat vulnerable to hurricanes  11  Its northern location and relatively cool waters tend to weaken storms to below hurricane strength by the time they reach Long Island  although despite this  some storms have made landfall at Category 1 or greater strength  including two unnamed Category 3 storms  the 1938 New England Hurricane  also known as the Long Island Express  and another in 1944  Named hurricanes that crossed Long Island include Hurricane Donna in 1960  Hurricane Belle in 1976  Hurricane Gloria in 1985  Hurricane Bob in 1991  brushed the eastern tip  and Hurricane Floyd in 1999   There is debate among climatologists as to whether Hurricane Floyd made landfall as a Category 1 or as a very strong  almost hurricane strength  tropical storm  The official records note it as the latter   In August 2011  portions of Long Island were evacuated in preparation for Hurricane Irene  a Category 1 hurricane   edit  Demographics Historical populations Census Pop

four counties of Long Island was 7 568 304  which is 39 percent of the population of the State of New York  New York City s portion of the census was 4 735 538  with Brooklyn s population at 2 504 700 and Queens having 2 230 722 residents  The combined population of Nassau and Suffolk counties was 2 832 882 people  Suffolk County s share at 1 493 350 and Nassau County s at 1 339 532  Nassau County had a larger population for decades  but Suffolk County surpassed it in the 1990 census as growth and development continued to spread eastward  As Suffolk County has over twice the land area of Nassau County  the latter still has a much higher population density  Combining all four counties  Long Island s population is greater than 38 of the 50 United States  If it were an independent nation  Long Island would rank as the 96th most populated nation  falling between Switzerland and Israel  Population figures from the U S  Census Bureau Census 2010 2  show that whites are the largest racial group in all four counties  and are in the majority in Nassau and Suffolk counties  In 2002  the New York Times cited a study by the non profit group ERASE Racism  12  which determined that Nassau and Suffolk counties are the most racially segregated suburbs in the United States  13  Catholics are the largest religious group on Long Island  with non affiliated in second place  Catholics make up 52  of the population of Nassau and Suffolk  versus 22  for the country as a whole  with Jews at 16  and 7  respectively versus 1 7  nationwide  14  Even more surprising is the small percentage of Protestants  7  and 8  respectively  for Nassau and Suffolk Counties  versus 23  for the entire country on the same survey  and 50  on self identification surveys  14  Long Island has a substantial Italian American population  About 26  of Long Island residents claim Italian ancestry  28  of Suffolk County residents claim Italian ancestry  citation needed  More recently  a Little India has

their neighbors At the time of European contact  the Lenape people  named the Delaware by Europeans  inhabited the western end of the Island  and spoke the Munsee dialect of the Algonquian language family  Giovanni da Verrazzano was the first European to record an encounter with these people when he entered what is now New York Bay in 1524  The eastern portion of the island was inhabited by speakers of the Mohegan Montauk Narragansett language group of the same language family  indicative of their ties to the aboriginal peoples inhabiting what is now Connecticut and Rhode Island  In 1609  the English navigator Henry Hudson explored the harbor and may have landed at Coney Island  Battle of Long Island The western portion of Long Island was later settled by the Dutch  while the eastern region was settled by English Puritans from New Haven  Connecticut  settling in Southold on October 21  1640  From the first half of the 17th century the Conklin family and other related families  like the Ketchums  Smiths  and Gardiners  owned the entire area of Long Island  Gardiners Island  and Manhattan  The entirety of Long Island came under English dominion in 1664  when the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam was taken over by the English and renamed New York  In 1683  the English established the three original counties on Long Island  Kings  Queens  and Suffolk  After the English took the land the Conklins were left with 3 500 square miles  9 100 km2  of New York land  During the American Revolutionary War  the island was captured from General George Washington early by the British in the Battle of Long Island  the largest battle of the entire war  The island remained a British stronghold until the end of the war  and was the center of much of General Washington s espionage activities due to the proximity to the British North American military headquarters in New York City  After the British victory on Long Island many Patriots fled  leaving mostly Loyalists behind  In the 19th century  Long Island was still mainly rural and agricultural  The predecessor to the Long Island Rail Road began service in 1836 from the South Ferry  Brooklyn  through Brooklyn to Jamaica in Queens  and completed the line to the east end of Long Island in 1844  From 1830 until 1930  population roughly doubled every twenty years  and several cities were incorporated  such as the City of Brooklyn in Kings County  and Long Island City in Queens  The Brooklyn Bridge  the first of seven bridges constructed across the East River  connects Long Island with the Borough of Manhattan  in background   Until the 1883 completion of the Brooklyn Bridge  the only connection between Long Island and the rest of the United States was by boat  Other bridges and tunnels followed  and a suburban character spread as population increased  On January 1  1898  Kings County and portions of Queens were consolidated into The City of Greater New York  abolishing all cities and towns within them  The easternmost 280 square miles  730 km2  of Queens County  which were not part of the consolidation plan  19  20  21  22  23  24  separated from Queens in 1899 to form Nassau County  At the close of the 19th century  the communities along the North Shore of Long Island saw the construction of large  baronial  estates built by men who made vast fortunes during the guilded age  The availability of land with water views along with the proximity to Manhattan  made men like J  P Morgan  William K Vanderbilt  Charles Pratt create clumps of estates that would give the area its moniker  Gold Coast  Books like The Great Gatsby chronicle their lives and the era  In the 1920s and 1930s  Long Island began the transformation from backwoods and farms to the paradigm of the American suburb  Railroads made possible commuting suburbs before construction of the Long Island Expressway and other major roadways  Robert Moses created various parkway projects to span the island  along with state parks for the enjoyment of many  Gradually  development started to follow the parkways  with various communities springing up along the more traveled routes  After World War II  Long Island s population skyrocketed  mostly in Nassau County and western Suffolk County  People who worked and lived in New York City moved out to Long Island in new developments built during the post war boom  The most famous post war development was the town of Levittown  the area became the first place to massively reproduce houses on a grand scale  providing opportunities for GIs returning home to start a family  The immigration waves of southern and eastern Europe  followed by more recent ones from Latin America  have been pivotal in creating the diversity on Long Island that many other American regions lack  These immigrations are reflected in the large Italian American  Irish American and Jewish American populations   edit  Economy Main article  Economy of Long Island F 14 Tomcat on static display pedestal at

Companies in the park and abroad are represented by the Hauppauge Industrial Association  As many as 20 percent of Long Islanders commute to New York City jobs  The eastern end of the island is still partly agricultural  In the last 25 years  development of vineyards on the North Fork became a major new industry  replacing potato fields  Pumpkin farms have been added to traditional truck farming  Farms allow fresh fruit picking by Long Islanders for much of the year  Fishing continues to be an important industry  especially at Huntington  Northport  Montauk  and other coastal communities of the East End and South Shore   edit  Government and politics Main article  Politics of Long Island Nassau County and Suffolk County each have their own governments  with a County Executive leading
