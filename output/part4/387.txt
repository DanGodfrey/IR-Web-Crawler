Westminster  London  United Kingdom Website http   www parliament uk  The Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 1  is the supreme legislative body in the United Kingdom  British Crown dependencies and British overseas territories  It is located in Westminster  London  Parliament alone possesses legislative supremacy and thereby ultimate power over all other political bodies in the UK and its territories  At its head is the Sovereign  Queen Elizabeth II  The parliament is bicameral  with an upper house  the House of Lords  and a lower house  the House of Commons  2  The Queen is the third component of the legislature  3  4  The House of Lords includes two different types of members  the Lords Spiritual  the senior bishops of the Church of England  and the Lords Temporal  members of the Peerage  whose members are not elected by the population at large  but are appointed by the Sovereign on advice of the Prime Minister  5  Prior to the opening of the Supreme Court in October 2009 the House of Lords also performed a judicial role through the Law Lords  The House of Commons is a democratically elected chamber with elections to it held at least every five years  6  The two Houses meet in separate chambers in the Palace of Westminster  commonly known as the Houses of Parliament   in London  By constitutional convention  all government ministers  including the Prime Minister  are members of the House of Commons or  less often  the House of Lords  and are thereby accountable to the respective branches of the legislature  The Parliament of Great Britain was formed in 1707 following the ratification of the Treaty of Union by both the Parliament of England and Parliament of Scotland passing Acts of Union  However  in practice the parliament was a continuation of the English parliament with the addition of Scottish MPs and peers  Parliament was further enlarged by the ratification by the Parliament of Great Britain and the Parliament of Ireland of the Act of Union  1800   which abolished the Irish Parliament  this added 100 Irish members to the Commons and 32 to the Lords to create the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland  It has been called  the mother of parliaments   7  its democratic institutions having set the standards for many democracies throughout the world  8  and the United Kingdom parliament is the largest Anglophone legislative body in the world  9  In theory  supreme legislative power is vested in the Queen in Parliament  in practice in modern times  real power is vested in the House of Commons  as the Sovereign generally acts on the advice of the Prime Minister  and the powers of the House of Lords have been limited  10  Contents 1 History 1 1 Parliament of the United

United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was created in 1801 by the merger of the Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland under the Act of Union  The principle of ministerial responsibility to the lower House did not develop until the 19th century the House of Lords was superior to the House of Commons both in theory and in practice  Members of the House of Commons were elected in an antiquated electoral system  under which constituencies of vastly different sizes existed  Thus  the borough of Old Sarum  with seven voters  could elect two members  as could the borough of Dunwich  which had completely disappeared into the sea due to land erosion  In many cases  members of the Upper House also controlled tiny constituencies  known as pocket or rotten boroughs  and could ensure the election of their relatives or supporters  Many seats in the House of Commons were  owned  by the Lords  After the reforms of the 19th century  beginning with the Reform Act 1832  the electoral system in the lower House was much more regularised  No longer dependent on the upper House for their seats  members of the House of Commons began to grow more assertive  Parliament at night  with the London Eye visible in the background  The supremacy of the British House of Commons was established in the early 20th century  In 1909  the Commons passed the so called  People s Budget   which made numerous changes to the taxation system in a manner detrimental to wealthy landowners  The House of Lords  which consisted mostly of powerful landowners  rejected the Budget  On the basis of the Budget s popularity and the Lords  consequent unpopularity  the Liberal Party narrowly won two general elections in 1910  Using the result as a mandate  the Liberal Prime Minister  Herbert Henry Asquith  introduced the Parliament bill  which sought to restrict the powers of the House of Lords   He did not reintroduce the land tax provision of the People s Budget   When the Lords refused to pass the bill  Asquith countered with a promise extracted from the King in secret before the second general election of 1910 and requested the creation of several hundred Liberal peers so as to erase the Conservative majority in the House of Lords  In the face of such a threat  the House of Lords narrowly passed the bill  The Parliament Act 1911  as it became  prevented the Lords from blocking a money bill  a bill dealing with taxation   and allowed them to delay any other bill for a maximum of three sessions  reduced to two sessions in 1949   after which it could become law over their objections  However  regardless of the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949  The House of Lords has always retained the unrestricted power to be able to block and veto any bill outright which attempts to extend the life of parliament if the Lords do not believe it to be appropriate  democratic or fitting  In this case  the Parliament Acts can not be used to override the decision of the House of Lords  citation needed   edit  Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland The Government of Ireland Act 1920 created the parliaments of Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland and reduced the representation of both parts at Westminster   The number of Northern Ireland seats was increased again after the introduction of direct rule in 1973   The Irish Free State became independent in 1922  and in 1927 parliament was renamed the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland  Further reforms to the House of Lords have been made during the 20th century  The Life Peerages Act 1958 authorised the regular creation of life peerage dignities  By the 1960s  the regular creation of hereditary peerage dignities had ceased  thereafter  almost all new peers were life peers only  More recently  the House of Lords Act 1999 removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the Upper House  although it made an exception for 92 of them on a temporary basis  to be elected to life terms by the other hereditary peers with by elections upon their death   The House of Lords is now a chamber that is subordinate to the House of Commons  Additionally  the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 led to abolition of the judicial functions of the House of Lords with the creation of the new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in October 2009   edit  Composition and powers The legislative authority  the Crown in Parliament  has three separate elements  the Monarch  the House of Lords  and the House of Commons  No individual may be a member of both Houses  and members of the House of Lords are legally barred from voting in elections for members of the House of Commons  Royal Assent of the Monarch is required for all Bills to become law  and certain Delegated Legislation must be made by the Monarch by Order in Council  The Crown also has executive powers which do not depend on Parliament  through prerogative powers  which include among others the ability to dissolve Parliament  make treaties  declare war  award honours  and appoint officers and civil servants  In practice these are always exercised by the monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister and the other ministers of HM Government  The Prime Minister and government are directly accountable to Parliament  through its control of public finances  and to the public  through election of Members of Parliament  The Monarch also chooses the Prime Minister  who then forms a government from members of the houses of parliament  This must be someone who could command a majority in a confidence vote in the House of Commons  In the recent past the monarch has had to make a judgment  as in the appointment of Alec Douglas Home in 1963 when it was thought that the incumbent Prime Minister  Harold Macmillan  had become ill with terminal cancer  However  today the monarch is advised by the outgoing Prime Minister as to whom she should offer the position next  The Upper House is formally styled The Right Honourable The Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament Assembled  the Lords Spiritual being bishops of the Church of England and the Lords Temporal being Peers of the Realm  The Lords Spiritual and Lords Temporal are considered separate  estates   but they sit  debate and vote together  Since the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949  the powers of the House of Lords have been very much less than those of the House of Commons  All bills except money bills are debated and voted upon in House of Lords  however by voting against a bill  the House of Lords can only delay it for a maximum of two parliamentary sessions over a year  After this time  the House of Commons can force the Bill through without the Lords  consent under the Parliament Acts  The House of Lords can also hold the government to account through questions to government ministers and the operation of a small number of select committees  The highest court in England  amp  Wales and Northern Ireland used to be a committee of the House of Lords  but it became an independent supreme court in 2009  The Lords Spiritual formerly included all of the senior clergymen of the Church of England archbishops  bishops  abbots and mitred priors  Upon the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII the abbots and mitred priors lost their positions in Parliament  All diocesan bishops continued to sit in Parliament  but the Bishopric of Manchester Act 1847  and later acts  provide that only the 26 most senior are Lords Spiritual  These always include the incumbents of the  five great sees   namely the Archbishop of Canterbury  the Archbishop of York  the Bishop of London  the Bishop of Durham and the Bishop of Winchester  The remaining 21 Lords Spiritual are the most senior diocesan bishops  ranked in order of consecration  The Lords Temporal are all members of the Peerage  Formerly  they were hereditary peers  The right of some hereditary peers to sit in Parliament was not automatic  after Scotland and England united into Great Britain in 1707  it was provided that all peers whose dignities had been created by English Kings could sit in Parliament  but those whose dignities had been created by Scottish Kings were to elect a limited number of  representative peers   A similar arrangement was made in respect of Ireland when it was united with Great Britain in 1801  but when southern Ireland left the United Kingdom in 1922 the election of Irish representative peers ceased  By the Peerage Act 1963  the election of Scottish representative peers also ended  and all Scottish peers were granted the right to sit in Parliament  Under the House of Lords Act 1999  only life peerages  that is to say  peerage dignities which cannot be inherited  automatically entitle their holders to seats in the House of Lords  Of the hereditary peers  only 92 the Earl Marshal  the Lord Great Chamberlain and the 90 elected by other peers retain their seats in the House  The Commons  the last of the  estates  of the Kingdom  are represented in the House of Commons  which is formally styled The Honourable The Commons in Parliament Assembled  commons coming not from the term commoner  but from commune  the old French term for a district   The House currently consists of 650 members  Each  Member of Parliament  or  MP  is chosen by a single constituency according to the First Past the Post electoral system  Universal adult suffrage exists for those 18 and over  citizens of the United Kingdom  and those of the Republic of Ireland and Commonwealth nations resident in the United Kingdom are qualified to vote  unless they are in prison at the time of the elections  The term of members of the House of Commons depends on the term of Parliament  a maximum of five years  a general election  during which all the seats are contested  occurs after each dissolution  see below   All legislation must be passed by the House of Commons to become law and it controls taxation and the supply of money to the government  Government ministers  including the Prime Minister  must regularly answer questions in the House of Commons and there are a number of select committees that scrutinise particular issues and the workings of the government  There are also mechanisms that allow members of the House of Commons to bring to the attention of the government particular issues affecting their constituents   edit  State Opening Main article  State Opening of Parliament The State Opening of Parliament is an annual event that marks the commencement of a session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom  It is held in the House of Lords Chamber  usually in November or December  11  or in a general election year  when the new Parliament first assembles  The monarch reads a prepared speech  known as the Speech from the Throne  outlining the Government s agenda for the coming year  The speech is not written by the monarch  but rather by the Cabinet  and reflects the legislative agenda for which they seek the agreement of both Houses of Parliament  After the monarch leaves  each Chamber proceeds to the consideration of an  Address in Reply to Her Majesty s Gracious Speech   But first  each House considers a bill pro forma to symbolise their right to deliberate independently of the monarch  In the House of Lords  the bill is called the Select Vestries Bill  while the Commons equivalent is the Outlawries Bill  The Bills are considered for the sake of form only  and do not make any actual progress   edit  Procedure See also the stages of a bill section in Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom Both houses of the British Parliament are presided over by a speaker  the Speaker of the House for the Commons and the Lord Speaker in the House of Lords  For the Commons  the approval of the Sovereign is theoretically required before the election of the Speaker becomes valid  but it is  by modern convention  always granted  The Speaker s place may be taken by three deputies  known as the Chairman  First Deputy Chairman and Second Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means   They take their name from the Committee of Ways and Means  of which they were once presiding officers  but which no longer exists   Prior to July 2006  the House of Lords was presided over by a Lord Chancellor  a Cabinet member   whose influence as Speaker was very limited  whilst the powers belonging to the Speaker of the House of Commons are vast   However  as part of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005  the position of Speaker of the House of Lords  as it is termed in the Act  was separated from the office of Lord Chancellor  the office which has control over the judiciary as a whole   though the Lords remain largely self governing  Decisions on points of order and on the disciplining of unruly members are made by the whole body in the Upper House  but by the Speaker alone in the Lower House  Speeches in the House of Lords are addressed to the House as a whole  using the words  My Lords    but those in the House of Commons are addressed to the Speaker alone  using  Mr Speaker  or  Madam Speaker    Speeches may be made to both Houses simultaneously  As of June 2011  Barack Obama was the most recent person to address both Houses  12  Both Houses may decide questions by voice vote  members shout out  Aye  and  No  in the Commons or  Content  and  Not Content  in the Lords and the presiding officer declares the result  The pronouncement of either Speaker may be challenged  and a recorded vote  known as a division  demanded   The Speaker of the House of Commons may choose to overrule a frivolous request for a division  but the Lord Speaker does not have that power   In each House  a division requires members to file into one of the two lobbies alongside the Chamber  their names are recorded by clerks  and their votes are counted as they exit the lobbies to re enter the Chamber  The Speaker of the House of Commons is expected to be non partisan  and does not cast a vote except in the case of a tie  the Lord Speaker  however  votes along with the other Lords  Both Houses normally conduct their business in public  and there are galleries where visitors may sit   edit  Term Following a general election  a new Parliamentary session begins  Parliament is formally summoned 40 days in advance by the Sovereign  who is the source of parliamentary authority  On the day indicated by the Sovereign s proclamation  the two Houses assemble in their respective chambers  The Commons are then summoned to the House of Lords  where Lords Commissioners  representatives of the Sovereign  instruct them to elect a Speaker  The Commons perform the election  on the next day  they return to the House of Lords  where the Lords Commissioners confirm the election and grant the new Speaker the royal approval in the Sovereign s name  The business of Parliament for the next few days of its session involves the taking of the oaths of allegiance  Once a majority of the members has taken the oath in each House  the State Opening of Parliament may occur  The Lords take their seats in the House of Lords Chamber  the Commons appear at the Bar  immediately outside the Chamber   and the Sovereign takes his or her seat on the throne  The Sovereign then reads the Speech from the Throne the content of which is determined by the Ministers of the Crown outlining the Government s legislative agenda for the upcoming year  Thereafter  each House proceeds to the transaction of legislative business  By custom  before considering the Government s legislative agenda  a bill is introduced pro forma in each House the Select Vestries Bill in the House of Lords and the Outlawries Bill in the House of Commons  These bills do not become laws  they are ceremonial indications of the power of each House to debate independently of the Crown  After the pro forma bill is introduced  each House debates the content of the Speech from the Throne for several days  Once each House formally sends its reply to the Speech  legislative business may commence  appointing committees  electing officers  passing resolutions and considering legislation  A session of Parliament is brought to an end by a prorogation  There is a ceremony similar to the State Opening  but much less well known  Normally  the Sovereign does not personally attend the prorogation ceremony in the House of Lords  he or she is represented by Lords Commissioners  The next session of Parliament begins under the procedures described above  but it is not necessary to conduct another election of a Speaker or take the oaths of allegiance afresh at the beginning of such subsequent sessions  Instead  the State Opening of Parliament proceeds directly  To avoid the delay of opening a new session in the event of an emergency during the long summer recess  Parliament is no longer prorogued beforehand  but only after the Houses have reconvened in the autumn  the State Opening follows a few days later  Each Parliament comes to an end  after a number of sessions  in anticipation of a general election  Parliament is dissolved by virtue of the Fixed term Parliaments Act 2011  Prior to it  dissolution was effected by the Sovereign  always on the advice of the Prime Minister  The Prime Minister could seek dissolution because the time was politically advantageous to his or her party  If the Prime Minister loses the support of the House of Commons  Parliament will dissolve and a new election will be held  Parliaments can also be dissolved if two thirds of the House of Commons votes for an early election  Originally there was no fixed limit on the length of a Parliament  but the Triennial Act 1694 set the maximum duration at three years  As the frequent elections were deemed inconvenient  the Septennial Act 1715 extended the maximum to seven years  but the Parliament Act 1911 reduced it to five  During the Second World War  the term was temporarily extended to ten years by Acts of Parliament  Since the end of the war the maximum has remained five years  Modern Parliaments  however  rarely continued for the maximum duration  normally  they were dissolved earlier  For instance  the 52nd  which assembled in 1997  was dissolved after four years  The Septennial Act was repealed by the Fixed term Parliaments Act  Formerly  the demise of the Sovereign automatically brought a Parliament to an end  the Crown being seen as the caput  principium  et finis  beginning  basis and end  of the body  but this is no longer the case  The first change was during the reign of William and Mary  when it was seen to be inconvenient to have no Parliament at a time when succession to the Crown could be disputed  and an act was passed that provided that a Parliament was to continue for six months after the death of a Sovereign  unless dissolved earlier   This provision is today contained in the Representation of the People Act 1867   After each Parliament concludes  the Crown issues writs to hold a general election and elect new members of the House of Commons though membership of the House of Lords does not change due to dissolution   edit  Legislative functions Parliament meets in the Palace of Westminster  Laws can be made by Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament  While Acts can apply to the whole of the United Kingdom including Scotland  due to the continuing separation of Scots law many Acts do not apply to Scotland and are either matched by equivalent Acts that apply to Scotland alone or  since 1999  by legislation set by the Scottish Parliament relating to devolved matters  This has led to a paradox known as the West Lothian question  The existence of a devolved Scottish Parliament means that while Westminster MPs from Scotland may vote directly on matters that affect English constituencies  they may not have much power over their laws affecting their own constituency  While any Act of the Scottish Parliament may be overturned  amended or ignored by Westminster  in practice this has yet to happen  Furthermore  the existence of the Legislative Consent Motion enables English MPs to vote on issues nominally devolved to Scotland  as part of United Kingdom legislation  Since there is no devolved  English Parliament   the converse is not true  Laws  in draft form known as bills  may be introduced by any member of either House  but usually a bill is introduced by a Minister of the Crown  A bill introduced by a Minister is known as a  Government Bill   one introduced by another member is called a  Private Member s Bill   A different way of categorising bills involves the subject  Most bills  involving the general public  are called  Public Bills   A bill that seeks to grant special rights to an individual or small group of individuals  or a body such as a local authority  is called a  Private Bill   A Public Bill which affects private rights  in the way a Private Bill would  is called a  Hybrid Bill   Private Members  Bills make up the majority of bills  but are far less likely to be passed than government bills  There are three methods for an MP to introduce a Private Member s Bill  The Private Members  Ballot  once per Session  put names into a ballot  and those who win are given time to propose a bill  The Ten Minute Rule is another method  where MPs are granted ten minutes to outline the case for a new piece of legislation  Standing Order 57 is the third method  which allows a bill to be introduced without debate if a day s notice is given to the Table Office  Filibustering is a danger  as an opponent to a bill can waste much of the limited time allotted to it  Private Members  Bills have no chance of success if the current government opposes them  but they are used in moral issues  the bills to decriminalise homosexuality and abortion were Private Members  Bills  for example  Governments can sometimes attempt to use Private Members  Bills to pass things it would rather not be associated with   Handout bills  are bills which a government hands to MPs who win Private Members  Ballots  Each Bill goes through several stages in each House  The first stage  called the first reading  is a formality  At the second reading  the general principles of the bill are debated  and the House may vote to reject the bill  by not passing the motion  That the Bill be now read a second time   Defeats of Government Bills are extremely rare  the last being in 2005  Following the second reading  the bill is sent to a committee  In the House of Lords  the Committee of the Whole House or the Grand Committee are used  Each consists of all members of the House  the latter operates under special procedures  and is used only for uncontroversial bills  In the House of Commons  the bill is usually committed to a Public Bill Committee  consisting of between 16 and 50 members  but the Committee of the Whole House is used for important legislation  Several other types of committees  including Select Committees  may be used  but rarely  A committee considers the bill clause by clause  and reports the bill as amended to the House  where further detailed consideration   consideration stage  or  report stage   occurs  However  a practice which used to be called the kangaroo  Standing Order 32  allows the Speaker to select which amendments are debated  This device is also used under Standing Order 89 by the committee chairman  to restrict debate in committee  Once the House has considered the bill  the third reading follows  In the House of Commons  no further amendments may be made  and the passage of the motion  That the Bill be now read a third time  is passage of the whole bill  In the House of Lords further amendments to the bill may be moved  After the passage of the third reading motion  the House of Lords must vote on the motion  That the Bill do now pass   Following its passage in one House  the bill is sent to the other House  If passed in identical form by both Houses  it may be presented for the Sovereign s Assent  If one House passes amendments that the other will not agree to  and the two Houses cannot resolve their disagreements  the bill fails  However  since the passage of the Parliament Act 1911 the power of the House of Lords to reject bills passed by the House of Commons has been restricted  and further restrictions were placed by the Parliament Act 1949  If the House of Commons passes a public bill in two successive sessions  and the House of Lords rejects it both times  the Commons may direct that the bill be presented to the Sovereign for his or her Assent  disregarding the rejection of the Bill in the House of Lords  In each case  the bill must be passed by the House of Commons at least one calendar month before the end of the session  The provision does not apply to bills originated in the House of Lords  to bills seeking to extend the duration of a Parliament beyond five years  or to Private Bills  A special procedure applies in relation to bills classified by the Speaker of the House of Commons as  Money Bills   A Money Bill concerns solely national taxation or public funds  the Speaker s certificate is deemed conclusive under all circumstances  If the House of Lords fails to pass a Money Bill within one month of its passage in the House of Commons  the Lower House may direct that the Bill be submitted for the Sovereign s Assent immediately  Even before the passage of the Parliament Acts  the Commons possessed pre eminence in cases of financial matters  By ancient custom  the House of Lords may not introduce a bill relating to taxation or Supply  nor amend a bill so as to insert a provision relating to taxation or Supply  nor amend a Supply Bill in any way  The House of Commons is free to waive this privilege  and sometimes does so to allow the House of Lords to pass amendments with financial implications  The House of Lords remains free to reject bills relating to Supply and taxation  but may be overruled easily if the bills are Money Bills   A bill relating to revenue and Supply may not be a Money Bill if  for example  it includes subjects other than national taxation and public funds   The last stage of a bill involves the granting of the Royal Assent  Theoretically  the Sovereign may either grant the Royal Assent  that is  make the bill a law  or withhold it  that is  veto the bill   Under modern conventions the Sovereign always grants the Royal Assent  in the Norman French words  La reyne le veult   the Queen wishes it   Le roy  instead in the case of a king   The last refusal to grant the Assent was in 1708  when Queen Anne withheld her Assent from a bill  for the settling of Militia in Scotland   in the words  La reyne s avisera   the Queen will think it over   Thus  every bill obtains the assent of all three components of Parliament before it becomes law  except where the House of Lords is over ridden under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949   The words  BE IT ENACTED by the Queen s  King s  most Excellent Majesty  by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal  and Commons  in this present Parliament assembled  and by the authority of the same  as follows     or  where the House of Lords  authority has been overridden by use of the Parliament Acts  the words  BE IT ENACTED by The Queen s  King s  most Excellent Majesty  by and with the advice and consent of the Commons in this present Parliament assembled  in accordance with the provisions of the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949  and by the authority of the same  as follows    appear near the beginning of each Act of Parliament  These words are known as the enacting formula   edit  Judicial functions Prior to the creation of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in October 2009  Parliament also used to perform several judicial functions  The Queen in Parliament constituted the highest court in the realm for most purposes  but the Privy Council had jurisdiction in some cases  for instance  appeals from ecclesiastical courts   The jurisdiction of Parliament arose from the ancient custom of petitioning the Houses to redress grievances and to do justice  The House of Commons ceased considering petitions to reverse the judgements of lower courts in 1399  effectively leaving the House of Lords as the court of last resort  In modern times  the judicial functions of the House of Lords were performed not by the whole House  but by a group of  Lords of Appeal in Ordinary   judges granted life peerage dignities under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 by the Sovereign  and by  Lords of Appeal   other peers with experience in the judiciary   However  under the Constitutional Reform Act 2005  these judicial functions were transferred to the newly created Supreme Court in 2009  and the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary became the first Justices of the Court  Peers who hold high judicial office are no longer allowed to vote or speak in the Lords until they retire as Justices  In the late 19th century  Acts allowed for the appointment of Scottish Lords of Appeal in Ordinary and ended appeal in Scottish criminal matters to the House of Lords  so that the High Court of Justiciary became the highest criminal court in Scotland  Nowadays the House of Lords legislative committee usually has a minimum of two Scottish Judges to ensure that some experience of Scots law is brought to bear on Scottish appeals in civil cases  from the Court of Session  Certain other judicial functions have historically been performed by the House of Lords  Until 1948  it was the body in which peers had to be tried for felonies or high treason  now  they are tried by normal juries  When the House of Commons impeaches an individual  the trial takes place in the House of Lords  Impeachments are now rare  the last one occurred in 1806  In 2006  a number of MPs attempted to revive the custom  having signed a motion for the impeachment of Tony Blair  but this was unsuccessful   edit  Relationship with the Government The British Government is answerable to the House of Commons  However  neither the Prime Minister nor members of the Government are elected by the House of Commons  Instead  the Queen requests the person most likely to command the support of a majority in the House  normally the leader of the largest party in the House of Commons  to form a government  So that they may be accountable to the Lower House  the Prime Minister and most members of the Cabinet are  by convention  members of the House of Commons  The last Prime Minister to be a member of the House of Lords was Alec Douglas Home  14th Earl of Home  who became Prime Minister in 1963  To adhere to the convention under which he was responsible to the Lower House  he disclaimed his peerage and procured election to the House of Commons within days of becoming Prime Minister  Governments have a tendency to dominate the legislative functions of Parliament  by using their in built majority in the House of Commons  and sometimes using their patronage power to appoint supportive peers in the Lords  dubious   discuss  In practice  governments can pass any legislation  within reason  in the Commons they wish  unless there is major dissent by MPs in the governing party  dubious   discuss  But even in these situations  it is highly unlikely a bill will be defeated  though dissenting MPs may be able to extract concessions from the government  In 1976  Lord Hailsham created a now widely used name for this behaviour  in an academic paper called  elective dictatorship   Parliament controls the executive by passing or rejecting its Bills and by forcing Ministers of the Crown to answer for their actions  either at  Question Time  or during meetings of the parliamentary committees  In both cases  Ministers are asked questions by members of their Houses  and are obliged to answer  Although the House of Lords may scrutinise the executive through Question Time and through its committees  it cannot bring down the Government  A ministry must always retain the confidence and support of the House of Commons  The Lower House may indicate its lack of support by rejecting a Motion of Confidence or by passing a Motion of No Confidence  Confidence Motions are generally originated by the Government in order to reinforce its support in the House  whilst No Confidence Motions are introduced by the Opposition  The motions sometimes take the form  That this House has  no  confidence in Her Majesty s Government  but several other varieties  many referring to specific policies supported or opposed by Parliament  are used  For instance  a Confidence Motion of 1992 used the form   That this House expresses the support for the economic policy of Her Majesty s Government   Such a motion may theoretically be introduced in the House of Lords  but  as the Government need not enjoy the confidence of that House  would not be of the same effect as a similar motion in the House of Commons  the only modern instance of such an occurrence involves the  No Confidence  motion that was introduced in 1993 and subsequently defeated  Many votes are considered votes of confidence  although not including the language mentioned above  Important bills that form part of the Government s agenda  as stated in the Speech from the Throne  are generally considered matters of confidence  The defeat of such a bill by the House of Commons indicates that a Government no longer has the confidence of that House  The same effect is achieved if the House of Commons  withdraws Supply   that is  rejects the budget  Where a Government has lost the confidence of the House of Commons  the Prime Minister is obliged either to resign  or seek the dissolution of Parliament and a new general election  Where a Prime Minister has ceased to retain a majority in that vote and requests a dissolution  the Sovereign can in theory reject his request  forcing his resignation and allowing the Leader of the Opposition to be asked to form a new government  This power is used extremely rarely  The conditions that should be met to allow such a refusal are known as the Lascelles Principles  These conditions and principles are merely informal conventions  it is possible  though highly improbable  for the Sovereign to refuse dissolution for no reason at all  In practice  the House of Commons  scrutiny of the Government is very weak  Since the first past the post electoral system is employed in elections  the governing party tends to enjoy a large majority in the Commons  there is often limited need to compromise with other parties  Modern British political parties are so tightly organised that they leave relatively little room for free action by their MPs  In many cases  MPs may be expelled from their parties for voting against the instructions of party leaders  During the 20th century  the Government has lost confidence issues only three times twice in 1924  and once in 1979   edit  Parliamentary Questions In the United Kingdom  question time lasts for an hour each day from Monday to Thursday  2 30 to 3 30 on Mondays and Tuesdays  11 30 to 12 30 on Wednesdays  and 10 30 to 12 30 on Thursdays   Each Government department has its place in a rota which repeats every fortnight  The exception to this sequence are the Business Questions  Questions to the Leader of House of Commons   in which questions are submitted about Parliamentary procedure  as well as any issue that MPs might want to raise to the government  Also  Questions to the Prime Minister takes place each Wednesday from 12 noon to 12 30  In addition to government departments  there are also questions regarding the Church  House of Commons reform and Law Rulings  13  Additionally  each Member of Parliament is entitled to file a limited number of written questions  Usually a Private Member directs a question to a Secretary of State  but it usually answered by a Minister of State or Parliamentary Under Secretary of State  Written Questions are submitted to the Clerks of the Table Office  either on paper or electronically  and are recorded in The Official Report  Hansard  so as to be widely available and accessible  13  In the House of Lords an Hour is put aside each afternoon at the start of the days proceedings for  Lords Questions   A peer submits a query in advance  which then appears on the Order Paper for the day s proceedings  13  The Lord shall say   My Lords  I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper   The Minister responsible then answers the query  Afterwards  for around ten minutes any Lord can ask the Minister questions on the theme of the original put down on the order paper   For instance  if the question regards immigration  Lords can ask the Minister any question related to immigration during the allowed period   13   edit  Questions in relation to the Royal family  No question can be put which brings the name of the Sovereign or the influence of the Crown directly before Parliament  or which casts reflections upon the Sovereign or the royal family  A question has been altered by the Speaker s direction on the ground that the name of the Sovereign should not be introduced to affect the views of the House  Questions are  however  allowed on such matters as the royal flight  royal train and royal palaces   Erskine May   2011  edit  Sovereignty Parliament Buildings  Stormont  Northern Ireland is home to the Northern Ireland Assembly  Several different views have been taken of Parliament s sovereignty  According to the jurist Sir William Blackstone   It has sovereign and uncontrollable authority in making  confirming  enlarging  restraining  abrogating  repealing  reviving  and expounding of laws  concerning matters of all possible denominations  ecclesiastical  or temporal  civil  military  maritime  or criminal     it can  in short  do every thing that is not naturally impossible   A different view has been taken by the Scottish judge Lord Cooper of Culross  When he decided the 1953 case of MacCormick v  Lord Advocate as Lord President of the Court of Session  he stated   The principle of unlimited sovereignty of Parliament is a distinctively English principle and has no counterpart in Scottish constitutional law   He continued   Considering that the Union legislation extinguished the Parliaments of Scotland and England and replaced them by a new Parliament  I have difficulty in seeing why the new Parliament of Great Britain must inherit all the peculiar characteristics of the English Parliament but none of the Scottish   Nevertheless  he did not give a conclusive opinion on the subject  Thus  the question of Parliamentary sovereignty appears to remain unresolved  Parliament has not passed any Act defining its own sovereignty  A related possible limitation on Parliament relates to the Scottish legal system and Presbyterian faith  preservation of which were Scottish preconditions to the creation of the unified Parliament  Since the Parliament of the United Kingdom was set up in reliance on these promises  it may be that it has no power to make laws that break them  Parliament s power has often been eroded by its own Acts  Acts passed in 1921 and 1925 granted the Church of Scotland complete independence in ecclesiastical matters  More recently  its power has been restricted by membership of the European Union  which has the power to make laws enforceable in each member state  In the Factortame case  the European Court of Justice ruled that British courts could have powers to overturn British legislation contravening European law  Parliament has also created national devolved parliaments and assemblies with differing degrees of legislative authority in Scotland  Wales and Northern Ireland  Parliament still has the power over areas for which responsibility lies with the devolved institutions  but would gain the agreement of those institutions to act on their behalf  Similarly  it has granted the power to make regulations to Ministers of the Crown  and the power to enact religious legislation to the General Synod of the Church of England   Measures of the General Synod and  in some cases proposed statutory instruments made by ministers  must be approved by both Houses before they become law   In every case aforementioned  authority has been conceded by Act of Parliament and may be taken back in the same manner  It is entirely within the authority of Parliament  for example  to abolish the devolved governments in Scotland  Wales and Northern Ireland or to leave the EU  However  Parliament also revoked its legislative competence over Australia and Canada with the Australia and Canada Acts  although the Parliament of the United Kingdom could pass an Act reversing its action  it would not take effect in Australia or Canada as the competence of the Imperial Parliament is no longer recognised there in law  One well recognised exception to Parliament s power involves binding future Parliaments  No Act of Parliament may be made secure from amendment or repeal by a future Parliament  For example  although the Act of Union 1800 states that the Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland are to be united  forever   Parliament permitted southern Ireland to leave the United Kingdom in 1922   edit  Privileges Main article  Parliamentary privilege Each House of Parliament possesses and guards various ancient privileges  The House of Lords relies on inherent right  In the case of the House of Commons  the Speaker goes to the Lords  Chamber at the beginning of each new Parliament and requests representatives of the Sovereign to confirm the Lower House s  undoubted  privileges and rights  The ceremony observed by the House of Commons dates to the reign of King Henry VIII  Each House is the guardian of its privileges  and may punish breaches thereof  The extent of parliamentary privilege is based on law and custom  Sir William Blackstone states that these privileges are  very large and indefinite   and cannot be defined except by the Houses of Parliament themselves  The foremost privilege claimed by both Houses is that of freedom of speech in debate  nothing said in either House may be questioned in any court or other institution outside Parliament  Another privilege claimed is that of freedom from arrest  at one time this was held to apply for any arrest except for high treason  felony or breach of the peace but it now excludes any arrest on criminal charges  it applies during a session of Parliament  and 40 days before or after such a session  14  Members of both Houses are no longer privileged from service on juries  15  Both Houses possess the power to punish breaches of their privilege  Contempt of Parliament for example  disobedience of a subpoena issued by a committee may also be punished  The House of Lords may imprison an individual for any fixed period of time  but an individual imprisoned by the House of Commons is set free upon prorogation  16  The punishments imposed by either House may not be challenged in any court  and the Human Rights Act does not apply  17   edit  Emblem The crowned portcullis The quasi official emblem of the Houses of Parliament is a crowned portcullis  The portcullis was originally the badge of various English noble families from the 14th century  It went on to be adopted by the kings of the Tudor dynasty in the 16th century  under whom the Palace of Westminster became the regular meeting place of Parliament  The crown was added to make the badge a specifically royal symbol  The portcullis probably first came to be associated with the Palace of Westminster through its use as decoration in the rebuilding of the Palace after the fire of 1512  However  at the time it was only one of many symbols  The widespread use of the portcullis throughout the Palace dates from the 19th century  when Charles Barry and Augustus Pugin used it extensively as a decorative feature in their designs for the new Palace built following the disastrous 1834 fire  The crowned portcullis came to be accepted during the 20th century as the emblem of both houses of parliament  This was simply a result of custom and usage rather than a specific decision  The emblem now appears on official stationery  publications and papers  and is stamped on various items in use in the Palace of Westminster  such as cutlery  silverware and china  18   edit  See also History of democracy History of Parliament Parliamentary agents Parliamentary Brief Parliamentary records of the United Kingdom Records of members of
