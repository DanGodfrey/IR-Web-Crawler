Mythology From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search For other uses  see Mythology  disambiguation   and Myth  disambiguation   Prometheus  1868  by Gustave Moreau  The myth of Prometheus  first attested by Hesiodus  later became the basis of a trilogy of tragedy plays  possibly by Aeschylus  consisting of Prometheus Bound  Prometheus Unbound and Prometheus Pyrphoros The term mythology can refer either to the study of myths  or to a body or collection of myths  1  As examples  comparative mythology is the study of connections between myths from different cultures  2  whereas Greek mythology is the body of myths from ancient Greece  In the field of folkloristics  a myth is defined as a sacred narrative explaining how the world and humankind came to be in their present form  3  4  5  Many scholars in other fields use the term  myth  in somewhat different ways  5  6  7  In a very broad sense  the word can refer to any story originating within traditions  8

characteristics The main characters in myths are usually gods  supernatural heroes and humans  9  10  11  As sacred stories  myths are often endorsed by rulers and priests and closely linked to religion or spirituality  9  In the society in which it is told  a myth is usually regarded as a true account of the remote past  9  10  12  13  In fact  many societies have two categories of traditional narrative   true stories  or myths  and  false stories  or fables  14 Creation myths generally take place in a primordial age  when the world had not yet achieved its current form  9  and explain how the world gained its current form 3  4  5  15  and how customs  institutions and taboos were established  9  15   edit  Related concepts See also  Legend and Folktale Closely related to myth are legend and folktale  Myths  legends  and folktales are different types of traditional story  16  Unlike myths  folktales can be set in any time and any place  and they are not considered true or sacred by the societies that tell them  9  Like myths  legends are stories that are traditionally considered true  but are set in a more recent time  when the world was much as it is today  9  Legends generally feature humans as their main characters  whereas myths generally focus on superhuman characters  9  The distinction between myth  legend  and folktale is meant simply as a useful tool for grouping traditional stories  17  In many cultures  it is hard to draw a sharp line between myths and legends  18  Instead of dividing their traditional stories into myths  legends  and folktales  some cultures divide them into two categories  one that roughly corresponds to folktales  and one that combines myths and legends  19  Even myths and folktales are not completely distinct  A story may be considered true  and therefore a myth  in one society  but considered fictional  and therefore a folktale  in another society  20  21  In fact  when a myth loses its status as part of a religious system  it often takes on traits more typical of folktales  with its formerly divine characters reinterpreted as human heroes  giants  or fairies  10  Myth  legend  and folktale are only a few of the categories of traditional stories  Other categories include anecdotes and some kinds of jokes  17  Traditional stories  in turn  are only one category within folklore  which also includes items such as gestures  costumes  and music  21   edit  Origins of myth  edit  Euhemerism Main article  Euhemerus One theory claims that myths are distorted accounts of real historical events  22  23  According to this theory  storytellers repeatedly elaborated upon historical accounts until the figures in those accounts gained the status of gods  22  23  For example  one might argue that the myth of the wind god Aeolus evolved from a historical account of a king who taught his people to use sails and interpret the winds  22 Herodotus  5th century BC  and Prodicus made claims of this kind  23  This theory is named  euhemerism  after the mythologist Euhemerus  c 320 BC   who suggested that the Greek gods developed from legends about human beings  23  24   edit  Allegory Some theories propose that myths began as allegories  According to one theory  myths began as allegories for natural phenomena  Apollo represents fire  Poseidon represents water  and so on  23  According to another theory  myths began as allegories for philosophical or spiritual concepts  Athena represents wise judgment  Aphrodite represents desire  etc  23  The 19th century Sanskritist Max M ller supported an allegorical theory of myth  He believed that myths began as allegorical descriptions of nature  but gradually came to be interpreted literally  for example  a poetic description of the sea as  raging  was eventually taken literally  and the sea was then thought of as a raging god  25   edit  Personification See also  Mythopoeic thought Some thinkers believe that myths resulted from the personification of inanimate objects and forces  According to these thinkers  the ancients worshipped natural phenomena such as fire and air  gradually coming to describe them as gods  26  For example  according to the theory of mythopoeic thought  the ancients tended to view things as persons  not as mere objects  27  thus  they described natural events as acts of personal gods  thus giving rise to myths  28   edit  The myth ritual theory See also  Myth and ritual According to the myth ritual theory  the existence of myth is tied to ritual  29  In its most extreme form  this theory claims that myths arose to explain rituals  30  This claim was first put forward by the biblical scholar William Robertson Smith  31  According to Smith  people begin performing rituals for some reason that is not related to myth  later  after they have forgotten the original reason for a ritual  they try to account for the ritual by inventing a myth and claiming that the ritual commemorates the events described in that myth  32  The anthropologist James Frazer had a similar theory  Frazer believed that primitive man starts out with a belief in magical laws  later  when man begins to lose faith in magic  he invents myths about gods and claims that his formerly magical rituals are religious rituals intended to appease the gods  33   edit  Functions of myth Mircea Eliade argued that one of the foremost functions of myth is to establish models for behavior 34  35  and that myths may also provide a religious experience  By telling or reenacting myths  members of traditional societies detach themselves from the present and return to the mythical age  thereby bringing themselves closer to the divine  12  35  36  Lauri Honko asserts that  in some cases  a society will reenact a myth in an attempt to reproduce the conditions of the mythical age  For example  it will reenact the healing performed by a god at the beginning of time in order to heal someone in the present  37  Similarly  Roland Barthes argues that modern culture explores religious experience  Because it is not the job of science to define human morality  a religious experience is an attempt to connect with a perceived moral past  which is in contrast with the technological present  38  Joseph Campbell defined myths as having four basic functions  the Mystical Function experiencing the awe of the universe  the Cosmological Function explaining the shape of the universe  the Sociological Function supporting and validating a certain social order  and the Pedagogical Function how to live a human lifetime under any circumstances  39   edit  The study of mythology  a historical overview See also  Comparative mythology Historically  the important approaches to the study of mythology have been those of Vico  Schelling  Schiller  Jung  Freud  L vy Bruhl  L vi Strauss  Frye  the Soviet school  and the Myth and Ritual School  40   edit  Pre modern theories The critical interpretation of myth goes back as far as the Presocratics  41 Euhemerus was one of the most important pre modern mythologists  He interpreted myths as accounts of actual historical events  distorted over many retellings  This view of myths and their origin is criticised by Plato in the Phaedrus  229d   in which Socrates says that this approach is the province of one who is  vehemently curious and laborious  and not entirely happy        The Platonists generally had a more profound and comprehensive view of the subject  Sallustius  42  for example  divides myths into five categories   theological  physical  or concerning natural laws   animastic  or concerning soul   material and mixed  This last being those myths which show the interaction between two or more of the previous categories and which  he says  are particularly used in initiations  Although Plato famously condemned poetic myth when discussing the education of the young in the Republic  primarily on the grounds that there was a danger that the young and uneducated might take the stories of Gods and heroes literally  nevertheless he constantly refers to myths of all kinds throughout his writings  As Platonism developed in the phases commonly called  middle Platonism  and neoplatonism  such writers as Plutarch  Porphyry  Proclus  Olympiodorus and Damascius wrote explicitly about the symbolic interpretation of traditional and Orphic myths  43  Interest in polytheistic mythology revived in the Renaissance  with early works on mythography appearing in the 16th century  such as the Theologia mythologica  1532    edit  19th century theories The first scholarly theories of myth appeared during the second half of the 19th century  41  In general  these 19th century theories framed myth as a failed or obsolete mode of thought  often by interpreting myth as the primitive counterpart of modern science  44  For example  E  B  Tylor interpreted myth as an attempt at a literal explanation for natural phenomena  unable to conceive of impersonal natural laws  early man tried to explain natural phenomena by attributing souls to inanimate objects  giving rise to animism  45  According to Tylor  human thought evolves through various stages  starting with mythological ideas and gradually progressing to scientific ideas  Not all scholars   not even all 19th century scholars   have agreed with this view  For example  Lucien L vy Bruhl claimed that  the primitive mentality is a condition of the human mind  and not a stage in its historical development   46  Max M ller called myth a  disease of language   He speculated that myths arose due to the lack of abstract nouns and neuter gender in ancient languages  anthropomorphic figures of speech  necessary in such languages  were eventually taken literally  leading to the idea that natural phenomena were conscious beings  gods  47  The anthropologist James Frazer saw myths as a misinterpretation of magical rituals  which were themselves based on a mistaken idea of natural law  48  According to Frazer  man begins with an unfounded belief in impersonal magical laws  When he realizes that his applications of these laws don t work  he gives up his belief in natural law  in favor of a belief in personal gods controlling nature   thus giving rise to religious myths  Meanwhile  man continues practicing formerly magical rituals through force of habit  reinterpreting them as reenactments of mythical events  Finally  Frazer contends  man realizes that nature does follow natural laws  but now he discovers their true nature through science  Here  again  science makes myth obsolete  as Frazer puts it  man progresses  from magic through religion to science   33  Robert Segal asserts that by pitting mythical thought against modern scientific thought  such theories implied that modern man must abandon myth  49   edit  20th century theories Many 20th century theories of myth rejected the 19th century theories  opposition of myth and science  In general   twentieth century theories have tended to see myth as almost anything but an outdated counterpart to science     Consequently  moderns are not obliged to abandon myth for science   49  Swiss psychologist Carl Jung  1873 1961  tried to understand the psychology behind world myths  Jung asserted that all humans share certain innate unconscious psychological forces  which he called archetypes  Jung believed that the similarities between the myths from different cultures reveals the existence of these universal archetypes  50  Joseph Campbell believed that there were two different orders of mythology  myths that  are metaphorical of spiritual potentiality in the human being   and myths  that have to do with specific societies   51  Claude L vi Strauss believed that myths reflect patterns in the mind and interpreted those patterns more as fixed mental structures   specifically  pairs of opposites  i e  good evil  compassionate callous    than as unconscious feelings or urges  52  In his appendix to Myths  Dreams and Mysteries  and in The Myth of the Eternal Return  Mircea Eliade attributed modern man s anxieties to his rejection of myths and the sense of the sacred  In the 1950s  Roland Barthes published a series of essays examining modern myths and the process of their creation in his book Mythologies   edit  Examples of myths  edit  Creation of man by Prometheus  Greek  Prometheus and Epimetheus were spared imprisonment in Tartarus because they had not fought with their fellow Titans during the war with the Olympians  They were given the task of creating man  Prometheus shaped man out of mud  and Athena breathed life into his clay figure  Prometheus had assigned Epimetheus the task of giving the creatures of the earth their various qualities  such as swiftness  cunning  strength  fur  wings etc  Unfortunately  by the time he got to man Epimetheus had given all the good qualities out and there were none left for man  So Prometheus decided to make man stand upright as the gods did and to give them fire  Prometheus loved man more than the Olympians  who had banished most of his family to Tartarus  So when Zeus decreed that man must present a portion of each animal they sacrificed to the gods Prometheus decided to trick Zeus  He created two piles  one with the bones wrapped in juicy fat  the other with the good meat hidden in the hide  He then bade Zeus to pick  Zeus chose the bones  Since he had given his word  Zeus had to accept that as his share for future sacrifices  In his anger over the trick  Zeus took fire away from man  However  Prometheus lit a torch from the sun and brought it back again to man  Zeus was enraged that man again had fire  He decided to inflict a terrible punishment on both man and Prometheus  To punish man  Zeus had Hephaestus create a mortal of stunning beauty  The gods gave the mortal many gifts of wealth  Zeus then had Hermes give the mortal a deceptive heart and a lying tongue  This creation was Pandora  the first woman  A final gift was a jar which Pandora was forbidden to open  Thus completed  Zeus sent Pandora down to Epimetheus who was staying amongst the men  Prometheus had warned Epimetheus not to accept gifts from Zeus but Pandora s beauty was too great and he allowed her to stay  Eventually  Pandora s curiosity about the jar she was forbidden to open became too great  She opened the jar and out flew all manner of evils  sorrows  plagues  and misfortunes  However  the bottom of the jar held one good thing   hope  Zeus was angry at Prometheus for three things  being tricked on sacrifices  stealing fire for man  and for refusing to tell Zeus which of Zeus s children would dethrone him  Zeus had his servants  Force and Violence  seize Prometheus  take him to the Caucasus Mountains  and chain him to a rock with unbreakable adamanite chains  Here he was tormented day and night by a giant eagle tearing at his liver  Zeus gave Prometheus two ways out of this torment  He could tell Zeus who the mother of the child that would dethrone him was or two conditions must be met  First  that an immortal must volunteer to die for Prometheus  Second  that a mortal must kill the eagle and unchain him  Eventually  Chiron the Centaur agreed to die for him and Heracles killed the eagle and unbound him   edit  Birth of Athena  Greek  Zeus came to lust after Metis and chased her in his direct way  Metis tried to escape  going so far as to change her form many times by turning into various creatures  such as hawks  fish  and serpents  However  Zeus was both determined and equally proficient in changing form  He continued his pursuit until she relented  An Oracle of Gaea then prophesied that Metis  first child would be a girl  but her second child would be a boy that would overthrow Zeus as had happened to his father and grandfather  Zeus took this warning to heart  When he next saw Metis  he flattered her and put her at her ease  Then  with Metis off guard  Zeus suddenly opened his mouth and swallowed her  This was the end of Metis  but possibly the beginning of Zeus  wisdom  After a time Zeus developed the mother of all headaches  He howled so loudly it could be heard throughout the earth  The other gods came to see what the problem was  Hermes realized what needed to be done and directed Hephaestus to take a wedge and split open Zeus s skull  Out of the skull sprang Athena  full grown and in a full set of armour  Due to her manner of birth  Athena has dominion over all things of the intellect   edit  Comparative mythology Main article  Comparative mythology Old Belgian banknote  depicting Ceres  Neptune and caduceus  Comparative mythology is the systematic comparison of myths from different cultures  2  It seeks to discover underlying themes that are common to the myths of multiple cultures  2  In some cases  comparative mythologists use the similarities between different mythologies to argue that those mythologies have a common source  This common source may be a common source of inspiration  e g  a certain natural phenomenon that inspired similar myths in different cultures  or a common  protomythology  that diverged into the various mythologies we see today  2  Nineteenth century interpretations of myth were often highly comparative  seeking a common origin for all myths  53  However  modern day scholars tend to be more suspicious of comparative approaches  avoiding overly general or universal statements about mythology  54  One exception to this modern trend is Joseph Campbell s book The Hero With a Thousand Faces  1949   which claims that all hero myths follow the same underlying pattern  This theory of a  monomyth  is out of favor with the mainstream study of mythology  54   edit  Myths in the 21st century In modern society  myth is often regarded as historical or obsolete  Many scholars in the cultural studies are now beginning to research the idea that myth has worked itself into modern discourses  Modern formats of communication allow for wide spread communication across the globe  thus enabling mythological discourse and exchange among greater audiences than ever before  Various elements of myth can now be found in television  cinema and video games  Although myth was traditionally transmitted through the oral tradition on a small scale  the technology of the film industry has enabled filmmakers to transmit myths to large audiences via film dissemination  Singer   Mythmaking  Philosophy in Film   3 6   In the psychology of Carl Jung  myths are the expression of a culture or society s goals  fears  ambitions and dreams  Indick   Classical Heroes in Modern Movies  Mythological Patterns of the Superhero   93 95   Film is ultimately an expression of the society in which it was credited  and reflects the norms and ideals of the time and location in which it is created  In this sense  film is simply the evolution of myth  The technological aspect of film changes the way the myth is distributed  but the core idea of the myth is the same  The basis of modern storytelling in both cinema and television lies deeply rooted in the mythological tradition  Many contemporary and technologically advanced movies often rely on ancient myths to construct narratives  The Disney Corporation is notorious among cultural study scholars for  reinventing  traditional childhood myths  Koven   Folklore Studies and Popular Film and Television  A Necessary Critical Survey   176 195   While many films are not as obvious as Disney fairy tales in respect to the employment of myth  the plot of many films are largely based on the rough structure of the myth  Mythological archetypes such as the cautionary tale regarding the abuse of technology  battles between gods  and creation stories are often the subject of major film productions  These films are often created under the guise of cyberpunk action movies  fantasy dramas  and apocalyptic tales  As heroes moved beyond the limiting constraints of the white heterosexual male in film and television  the narrative begins to reflect the archetypes of myth more accurately  Olson   Great Expectations  the Role of Myth in 1980s Films with Child Heroes    Although the range of narratives  as well as the medium in which it is being told is constantly increasing  it is clear that myth continues to be a pervasive and essential component of the collective imagination  Cormer   Narrative   Critical Ideas in Television Studies  47 59   Recent films such as Clash of the Titans and Immortals continue the trend of mining traditional mythology in order to directly create a plot for modern consumption  Although these are generally considered inaccurate to the original mythologies on which they are based  it can be argued that as film itself has become a way transmitting myths  these films are no more inaccurate than the variants told by storytellers of the oral tradition  In fact  it is argued that these new contributions to traditional myths add value and meaning to the stories for new generations  Matira   Children s Oral Literature and Modern Mass Media   55 57   With the invention of modern myths such as urban legends  the mythological traditional will carry on to the increasing variety of mediums available to the consumer in the 21st century and beyond  The crucial idea is that myth is not simply a collection of stories permanently fixed to a particular time and place in history  but an ongoing social practice within every society   edit  See also General Archetypal literary
