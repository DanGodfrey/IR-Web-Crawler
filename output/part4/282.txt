Chris Hemsworth as Thor  The god of thunder based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name  Director Kenneth Branagh and Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige chose Hemsworth after a back and forth process in which the 27 year old actor was initially dropped from consideration and then given a second chance to read for the part  7  Hemsworth stated that he gained 20 pounds for the role by eating non stop and revealed that  It wasn t until Thor that I started lifting weights  it was all pretty new to me   8  Regarding his take of the character  Hemsworth said   We just kept trying to humanize it all  and keep it very real  Look into all the research about the comic books that we could  but also bring it back to  Who is this guy as a person  and what s his relationship with people in the individual scenes    9  About approaching Thor s fighting style  he remarked   First  we looked at the comic books and the posturing  the way  Thor  moves and fights  and a lot of his power seems to be drawn up through the ground  We talked about boxers  you know  Mike Tyson  very low to the ground and big open chest and big shoulder swings and very sort of brutal but graceful at the same time  and then as we shot stuff things became easier   10  Natalie Portman as Jane Foster  A scientist and Thor s love interest  Marvel Studios stated in an announcement that the character was updated from the comics  initial portrayal for the feature adaptation  11  When asked why she took the role  Portman replied   I just thought it sounded like a weird idea because Kenneth Branagh s directing it  so I was just like   Kenneth Branagh doing Thor is super weird  I ve gotta do it    12  Portman stated that she really wanted to do a big effects movie that emphasized character  and getting to do it with Branagh was a new way of approaching it  relative to Star Wars  13  Regarding her preparation for the role Portman remarked   I signed on to do it before there was a script  And Ken  who s amazing  who is so incredible  was like   You can really help create this character   I got to read all of these biographies of female scientists like Rosalind Franklin who actually discovered the DNA double helix but didn t get the credit for it  The struggles they had and the way that they thought   I was like   What a great opportunity  in a very big movie that is going to be seen by a lot of people  to have a woman as a scientist   She s a very serious scientist  Because in the comic she s a nurse and now they made her an astrophysicist  Really  I know it sounds silly  but it is those little things that makes girls think it s possible  It doesn t give them a  role  model of  Oh  I just have to dress cute in movies    14  Hiddleston promoting the film in London in April 2011  Tom Hiddleston as Loki  Thor s adoptive brother and nemesis based on the deity of the same name  Hiddleston was chosen after previously working with Branagh on Ivanov and Wallander  15  Initially Hiddleston auditioned to play Thor but Branagh decided his talent would be better harnessed playing Loki  Hiddleston stated that  Loki s like a comic book version of Edmund in King Lear  but nastier   Hiddleston stated that he had to keep a strict diet before the start of filming because  Ken  Branagh  wants Loki to have a lean and hungry look  like Cassius in Julius Caesar  Physically  he can t be posing as Thor   16  Hiddleston looked at Peter O Toole as inspiration for Loki as well explaining   Interestingly enough   Kenneth Branagh  said to look at Peter O Toole in two specific films  The Lion in Winter and Lawrence of Arabia  What s interesting about     his performance  as King Henry  is you see how damaged he is  There s a rawness  to his performance   it s almost as if he s living with a layer of skin peeled away  He s grandiose and teary and  in a moment  by turns hilarious and then terrifying  What we wanted was that emotional volatility  It s a different acting style  it s not quite the same thing  but it s fascinating to go back and watch an actor as great as O Toole head for those great high hills   17  Anthony Hopkins as Odin  The ruler of Asgard  father of Thor  and adoptive father of Loki  based on the mythological deity of the same name  18  In an interview Hopkins stated he knew nothing of the comic  About the film he said   It s a superhero movie  but with a bit of Shakespeare thrown in   19  Hopkins stated   I m very interested in that relationship between fathers and sons   and that   My father s relationship with me was cold  He was a hot blood character but to me  cold  When I was young  he expressed his disappointment because I was bad in school and all of that  He didn t mean any harm  but I felt I could never meet up to his expectations   Hopkins expressed that he found a personal resonance in the Odin role  saying   He s a stern man  He s a man with purpose  I play the god who banishes his son from the kingdom of Asgard because he screwed up  He s a hot headed  temperamental young man    probably a chip off of the old block but I decide he s not really ready to rule the future kingdom  so I banish him  I m harsh and my wife complains and I say   That is why I m king   He s ruthless  take it or leave it  Women are much more forgiving  men are not so forgiving  I know in my life  my karma is   If you don t like it  tough  move on   And I move on  I m a little like Odin myself   20  Stellan Skarsg rd as Erik Selvig  A scientist doing research in New Mexico who encounters Thor  21  Skarsg rd stated that he was not initially familiar with Thor  22  As to why he took the part  Skarsg rd remarked  I  chose Thor because of  director  Kenneth Branagh  The script was nice and we got to rehearse and talk to the writers and do some collaborating in the process to make it fit us  So I had a very happy time on it  What I always try to do is immediately do something I just haven t done so I get variation in my life  I ve made about 90 films and if I did the same thing over and over again I would be bored by now  I try to pick different films  I go and do those big ones and having done that I can usually afford to go and do some really small obscure films and experiment a little   23  Kat Dennings as Darcy Lewis  A co worker of Jane Foster  24  Dennings described her character as Foster s  little helper gnome   13  Dennings stated that her role was expanded during the rehearsal process  25  Dennings explained   She s kind of like a cute  clueless  little puppy or maybe a hamster  There wasn t much on the page for the Darcy role to begin with and I didn t even see a script before I took the job so I didn t really know who Darcy was at first  But she really evolved   she s so much fun now even  She s very Scooby Doo if that makes sense  She s always three steps behind and reacting to what s happening with these great expressions     She gets things wrong and doesn t care   26  Idris Elba as Heimdall  The all seeing  all hearing Asgardian sentry of the bifr st bridge  based on the mythological deity of the same name  27  Elba said Branagh s involvement was a major incentive to take the role    Branagh  called me up personally and said   I know this isn t a big role  but I would really love to see you play it   It s Kenneth Branagh  I was like   Definitely    28  About the role Elba remarked   I did green screen for the first time  I wouldn t like to do a whole movie of green screen  though  You kind of forget the plot a little like being in a Broadway play and doing it over and over and forgetting your line halfway through   29  Elba stated he has made a four picture commitment with Marvel Studios  30  Elba s casting prompted a proposed boycott by the Council of Conservative Citizens and a debate amongst comic book fans  some insisting it was wrong for a black man to play a Nordic god  In response Elba called the debate  ridiculous   31  32  33  Colm Feore as Laufey  King of the Frost Giants and Loki s biological father  based on the mythological being of the same name  34  Feore stated it took five hours for his makeup to be applied  35  About his character Feore remarked   I am the King of Frost Giants  And if you ve seen any of the Frost Giants  you know that I am  of course  the Napoleon of Frost Giants  We ve got some massive  fabulous guys who dwarf me and come in at around eight and a half feet  nine feet  But  no  Can t you tell by the commanding presence  I am the boss   34  He said the Shakespearean training he shared with Hopkins and director Branagh helped keep production moving briskly  saying that  during the breaks  Tony  myself and Ken would be talking in Shakespearean shorthand about what the characters were doing  what we thought they may be like  and how we could focus our attention more intelligently  These were discussions that took no more than a few minutes between takes  but they allowed Ken  Tony and  me  to understand each other instantly without Ken taking an hour away to explain to the actors exactly what was going on  So that was enormously helpful   36  Ray Stevenson as Volstagg  A member of the Warriors Three  a group of three Asgardian adventurers who are among Thor s closest comrades  known for both his hearty appetite and wide girth  37  Stevenson previously worked with Kenneth Branagh in the 1998 film The Theory of Flight  and with Marvel Studios as the titular character in Punisher  War Zone  Stevenson wore a fat suit for the role  stating   I ve tried the suit on  and what they ve done is kind of sex him up  he s sort of slimmer but rounder    Stevenson said   He s got every bit of that Falstaffian verve and vigor  and a bit of a beer gut to suggest that enormous appetite  but he s not the sort of Weeble shaped figure he is in the comics  He s Falstaff with muscles  I ve got this amazing foam injected undersuit that flexes with me    38  Tadanobu Asano as Hogun  A member of the Warriors Three  primarily identified by his grim demeanor and as the only member who is not an  sir  37  Ray Stevenson said of Asano s character   He doesn t speak much but when he does  everybody shuts up  But also in the healing room where everyone licks their wounds  he s the guy who just goes about his business   39  Joshua Dallas as Fandral  A member of the Warriors Three  characterized as an irrepressible swashbuckler and romantic  37 Stuart Townsend was initially cast after Zachary Levi was forced to vacate the role due to a scheduling conflict  37  40  However  days before filming began  Townsend was replaced by Dallas citing  creative differences   41  Dallas said he believed that Fandral  would like to think of himself a philanderer  He would like to think of himself  I was saying  as the R  Kelly of Asgard  He s a lover  not a fighter   Dallas mentioned that Errol Flynn was an inspiration for the character stating   He was a big inspiration for the character and for me  I watched a lot of his movies and kind of got that into my bones  I tried to bring out that little bit of Flynn ness in it  Flynn had a lot of that boyish charm that Fandral s got      39  Jaimie Alexander as Sif  A warrior and Thor s childhood friend based on the mythological deity of the same name  Alexander is best known for her portrayal of Jessi XX on the ABC Family series Kyle XY  42  Alexander said that she was familiar with Marvel Comics before having taken the part  having grown up with four brothers  43  Alexander said the part required hours a day in the gym  though training is not unfamiliar to her  explaining she was one of few girls on her Colleyville  Texas  high school wrestling team  44  Alexander described her character as  one of the guys  and that   She s a very talented  skilled warrior and can stand on her own against any villain in the film   About her relationship with Thor she stated   She is very loyal to Thor and cares a lot about protecting him and protecting Asgard   45  Rene Russo as Frigga  The wife of Odin  queen of Asgard  stepmother of Thor and adoptive mother of Loki  based on the mythological deity of the same name  46  Russo stated in March 2011 interview that she has signed on for possible sequels  joking that   Eventually they ll kick me out  so who knows how many I ll do   47  Clark Gregg reprises his role as S H I E L D  Agent Phil Coulson from Iron Man and Iron Man 2  48 Adriana Barraza plays diner owner Isabel Alvarez and Maximiliano Hern ndez plays S H I E L D  Agent Jasper Sitwell  Actors Joseph Gatt  Joshua Cox and Douglas Tait portray Frost Giants  49  50 Stan Lee 51  and J  Michael Straczynski 52  have cameo appearances as pick up truck drivers  Samuel L  Jackson has an uncredited cameo as Nick Fury  director of S H I E L D   who as revealed in Iron Man is coordinating the  Avenger Initiative   Jeremy Renner has an uncredited cameo as Clint Barton  53 Dakota Goyo and Ted Allpress play Thor and Loki  respectively  as children   edit  Production  edit  Development  Thor s powers are godly  yes   But at the end of the day  he s a man    Odin sends him to Earth because he s not perfect  He s brash  arrogant  Even over confident   he also bleeds  He struggles  Life kicks him where it hurts the most    You want to feel Thor s rage when he rages  You want to see him fight like hell  and take as much as he dishes out    maybe more  You want to have a visceral reaction to the guy  and what happens to him  You don t want his adventures to be clean and antiseptic  You want to see the dirt  and grime and blood  You want to feel every bone crunching moment of every fight  And when he unleashes the storm  you want to feel like you re seeing the power of a GOD at work   Ashley Miller  co writer of Thor  about the project 54  Sam Raimi originally envisioned the idea for Thor after making Darkman  1990   he met Stan Lee and pitched the concept to 20th Century Fox  but they did not understand it  55 Thor was abandoned until April 1997  when Marvel Studios was beginning to expand rapidly  56  The film gained momentum after the success of X Men  2000   The plan was for Thor to be made for television  UPN was in talks for airing it  excited by the prospect  they pushed for a script and approached Tyler Mane to play Thor  57  In May 2000  Marvel Studios brought Artisan Entertainment to help finance it as a film  but Thor by June 2004 the project still had yet to be patronised by a studio  58  59  60 Sony Pictures Entertainment finally purchased the film rights  and in December 2004 David S  Goyer was in negotiations to write and direct  61  In 2005  though there were talks between Goyer and Marvel  it was revealed that Goyer was no longer interested  though at this point the film was still set to be distributed through Sony Pictures  62  Mark Protosevich  a fan of the Thor comic book  agreed to write the script in April 2006  and the project moved to Paramount Pictures  after it acquired the rights from Sony  63  That year the film was announced to be a Marvel Studios production  64  In December 2007  Protosevich described his plans for it  to be like a superhero origin story  but not one about a human gaining super powers  but of a god realizing his true potential  It s the story of an Old Testament god who becomes a New Testament god   65  In August 2007 Marvel Studios signed Matthew Vaughn to direct the film  66  Vaughn then rewrote Protosevich s script in order to bring down the budget to  150 million  as Protosevich s first draft would have cost  300 million to produce  3  He intended to start filming in late 2008 67  and after the success of Iron Man  Marvel Studios announced that they intended to release Thor on June 4  2010  with Iron Man 2 being used to introduce the character of Thor  68   edit  Pre production  Thor  at his best  has always had a classic bent in terms of his history  the way he speaks and the often Shakespearean dramas that surround him  That kind of dialogue and character needs someone who comes from a classically trained background in order for it not to sound forced or artificial  Branagh is the perfect choice   J Michael Straczynski  co writer of Thor  on Kenneth Branagh 69  Vaughn was released when his holding deal expired in May 2008  at which point Marvel set Protosevich to work on a new draft and began searching for a new director  70  By September 2008 D  J  Caruso had been discussing taking on the project  though he did not read the script  71  Later that month  it was revealed that Kenneth Branagh had entered into negotiations to direct  72  and in December 2008  Branagh confirmed that he has been hired  He described it as  a human story right in the center of a big epic scenario   73  Branagh stated that he hoped to begin filming in January 2010 74  and Marvel Studios set back the release date of the film from its scheduled July 16  2010 date to June 17  2011  almost a full year later  75  They later moved the release date to May 20  2011  to distance the film s release from that of Captain America  The First Avenger  another Marvel Studios film that was scheduled to be released on July 22  2011  76  In February 2009  Samuel L  Jackson  who had briefly portrayed Nick Fury at the end of the film Iron Man  signed on to reprise the role in Thor as part of an unprecedented nine picture deal with Marvel Studios  77  However  in an April 2010 interview  Jackson stated that he would not be appearing in Thor  When asked why not Jackson explained   I have no idea  I m not in charge of making those kinds of decisions  I thought I was  they said I was in the trades  and I was like   Ooh  I got a job   I called my agent he said   Naw  you re not in it   I was like   Well shit  they need to pay me if they re gonna put my name in it    78  Later in a February 2011 appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon  Jackson revealed that he would be filming a scene for Thor to serve as  connective tissue  for The Avengers  79  In February 2009  a casting call went out looking for actors with certain physical attributes to audition for the role of Thor  80  In May 2009  Chris Hemsworth was in negotiations to portray the title role after a back and forth process in which the 25 year old actor was refused early on  then given a second chance to read for the part  7  The next day  Marvel announced that Tom Hiddleston  who had worked with Branagh before and had initially been considered to portray the lead role  had been cast as Loki  15  81 Kevin Feige of Marvel Studios confirmed in June of that year that both Hemsworth and Hiddleston had signed on  82  Feige mentioned that the film would take place on both modern day Earth and Asgard but Thor s human host  Dr  Donald Blake  would not be included  82  With Hemsworth and Hiddleston in place  the rest of the cast began to fill out  In July  Marvel announced that Natalie Portman would portray Jane Foster  11 Jaimie Alexander and Colm Feore were reported to have joined the cast in September  with Alexander portraying Sif and Feore s role unrevealed  though it was thought to be a villain  42  In an interview with Swedish news site Ystads Allehanda  Stellan Skarsg rd stated that he had joined the cast  though he did not specify his role  21  By late October Anthony Hopkins had been cast as Odin in the film  18  The following month  Marvel announced that they had cast the Warriors Three  Fandral was to be played by Stuart Townsend  Hogun was to be played by Tadanobu Asano and Volstagg was to be played by Ray Stevenson  37 Idris Elba was announced to have joined the cast  portraying Heimdall  27  Natalie Portman revealed that Kat Dennings would be involved in the project  portraying Darcy  a coworker of Portman s Jane Foster  24  83  In December  Rene Russo was cast as Frigga  Thor s stepmother and Odin s wife  46  Later that month  actors Joseph Gatt  Troy Brenna  and Joshua Cox had been cast in the film  though none of their roles were revealed  49  In January 2010  Adriana Barraza had joined the film s cast  in a supporting capacity  84  Only days before filming began  Stuart Townsend was replaced by Joshua Dallas as Fandral  citing  creative differences   41  When Spider Man 4 s production stalled  Paramount and Marvel Entertainment pushed up the release of Thor by two weeks to the then vacated date of May 6  2011  85  The Science  amp  Entertainment Exchange introduced Marvel Entertainment  Kenneth Branagh   the screenwriter  and a few people on the design and production side of things  to three physicists  Sean Carroll  Kevin Hand  and Jim Hartle   as well as physics student Kevin Hickerson  to provide a realistic science background for the Thor universe  The consultation resulted in a change in Jane Foster s profession  from nurse to particle physicist  and the terminology  Einstein Rosen bridge  to describe the Bifrost Bridge  86   edit  Filming Director Kenneth Branagh promoting the film in London in April 2011  In October 2008  Marvel Studios signed a long term lease agreement with Raleigh Studios to photograph their next four films   Iron Man 2  Thor  Captain America  The First Avenger and The Avengers   at Raleigh s Manhattan Beach  California facility  87 Production Weekly reported that filming on Marvel s Thor was scheduled to begin in Los Angeles mid January  then move to Santa Fe  New Mexico from March until late April  88 Principal photography began on January 11  2010  89  A few days after filming began  it was reported that Clark Gregg had signed on to reprise his role from Iron Man and Iron Man 2 as Agent Coulson  48  In February  Paramount Pictures entered negotiations with Del Mar  California to use of 300 yard stretch of beach to film a scene for Thor involving six horses running down the terrain  Paramount said this coastline was ideal because its gradual slope of sand down to the waterline creates excellent reflective opportunities on film  90  On March 15  2010 production of Thor moved to Galisteo  New Mexico  where an old fashioned Western movie town was extensively modified for the shoot  91  92  Branagh  a fan of the comic book since childhood  commented on the challenge of bridging Asgard and the modern world   Inspired by the comic book world both pictorially and compositionally at once  we ve tried to find a way to make a virtue and a celebration of the distinction between the worlds that exist in the film but absolutely make them live in the same world  It s about finding the framing style  the color palette  finding the texture and the amount of camera movement that helps celebrate and express the differences and the distinctions in those worlds  If it succeeds  it will mark this film as different     The combination of the primitive and the sophisticated  the ancient and the modern  I think that potentially is the exciting fusion  the exciting tension in the film   93  By April  the prospect for filming parts of Thor in Del Mar  California had fallen through  Paramount Pictures sent a letter informing the city that it has instead chosen an undisclosed Northern California location to film a beachfront scene for the film  The letter cited cost concerns with moving production too far away from its headquarters  94   edit  Post production The film ended principal photography on May 6  2010 and entered the  post production  phase  9  It was reported in February 2010 that France based BUF Compagnie would be the lead visual effects house working on the film  95 Digital Domain worked on the visual effects as well  96  Branagh stated that BUF  who developed the effects for the race through space was much inspired by Hubble photography and other images of deep space  Branagh stated he sent paintings from classic studies by J  M  W  Turner to Digital Domain when creating Jotunheim  97  The film was released in a 3 D version  In an interview with the Los Angeles Times  Kenneth Branagh stated that the 3 D process initially made him cringe but  We came to feel that in our case 3 D could be the very good friend of story and character for a different kind of experience   98  Although 2 D was used for principal photography  producer Kevin Fiege stated that the  special effects for the film were conceived and executed from the beginning in 3 D   98  In October 2010  casting calls went out for bit players to appear in an undisclosed number of reshoots  99  In March 2011  scenes involving Adriana Barraza were removed from the theatrical cut of the film during the editing process  Kenneth Branagh sent a letter of apology explaining the reasons for the cut and desire to work with Barraza again in the future  In response Barraza stated   It saddens me because the movie is great and because I was acting alongside some tremendous actors that I admire very much  but I understand the nature of films  and it s not the first or last time that scenes will be cut   100  Barraza appears in only one scene in the film s theatrical cut  In that same month  Douglas Tait revealed that he preformed for motion capture of the Frost Giants  101  On his hiring  Tait said  I am 6 5  and have a lean  athletic build  and they hired guys who were 6 7  and taller  and weighed over 250 pounds  When the film was being edited  they wanted to make them even bigger and move faster  They auditioned people again and Kenneth Branagh chose me to perform the motion capture movements of the Frost Giants   101  In April 2011  the IMAX Corporation  Paramount Pictures and Marvel Entertainment announced that they have finalized an agreement to release the film on digital IMAX 3D screens  The release marked the continuation of the partnership between the companies  which started on Iron Man 2  102  The post credits scene in which Skarsg rd s Erik Selvig comes face to face with Samuel L  Jackson s Nick Fury was directed by Joss Whedon  who is directing The Avengers  2012   103   edit  Music See also  Thor  soundtrack  In March 2011  Buena Vista Records announced the details for the soundtrack  The album includes Patrick Doyle s original score from

film  The song  Walk  plays during a scene in which Thor  stripped of his powers and marooned on Earth  retreats to a New Mexico roadhouse to drink away the night with boilermakers and carouse with Stellan Skarsg rd s character  The track plays again over the closing credits  Feige stated   It was literally one of those things that came together in a matter of weeks  and if you asked two months ago if we would have a Foo Fighters song in this movie  I would have said I don t think so  but we heard the song and it just has these eerie appropriate lyrics and themes  The song wasn t written for the movie  obviously  it s on their new album  but we almost couldn t believe it when we heard it  Ken in particular just loved it with these lyrics about learning to walk again and the way that fit the themes of the movie about redemption  learning to be a hero  The song starts off talking about being a million miles away from home and yearning and being separated by vast distances  and it s no secret that Thor and Jane are from different worlds   105   edit  Release The world premiere of Thor took place on Sunday  April 17  2011 at the Event Cinemas theatre in George Street  Sydney  106

human drama  Thor is mighty Marvel entertainment   130 Metacritic assigned a weighted average score of 57 100 based on reviews from 40 film critics  a middling score on their scale  131  Richard Kuipers of Variety stated   Thor delivers the goods so long as butt is being kicked and family conflict is playing out in celestial dimensions  but is less thrilling during the Norse warrior god s rather brief banishment on Earth   132  Megan Lehmann of The Hollywood Reporter wrote   The hammer hurling god of thunder kicks off this superhero summer with a bang   133  In the Chicago Sun Times  Richard Roeper liked the movie   Thanks in large part to a charming  funny and winning performance from Australian actor Chris Hemsworth in the title role  Thor is the most entertaining superhero debut since the original Spider Man   134  Conversely  Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave it a negative review stating   Thor is failure as a movie  but a success as marketing  an illustration of the ancient carnival tactic of telling the rubes anything to get them into the tent   135 A O  Scott of the New York Times disliked the film as well  calling Thor   an example of the programmed triumph of commercial calculation over imagination   136 Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times had mixed feelings  describing the film as  an aesthetic stand off between predictable elements and unexpected ones   Turan praised the performances of Hemsworth  Hopkins  and Elba  but found the special effects inconsistent and the Earth storyline derivative  137   edit  Accolades Year Award

Avengers   Thor will go off into a new adventure   144  However when asked about Feige s comments director Kenneth Branagh responded   It is kind of news to me  Here s what I would say to that  It s that I m thrilled they re that confident  I shall wait for the audience to tell us whether there should be a second one  and then if that s a nice conversation to be had between all of us  that d be thrilling  But I ve got too much Irish superstitious blood in me to assume that Thor 2 will happen  But if Marvel says so  then I guess it must be true   145  Feige later explained that they ll wait to see how well Thor does at the box office before officially announcing sequels but stated   Don Payne is working on story ideas for a part two  We ve got various options with Ken  Branagh  to discuss coming back  but right now the focus is on the first one  Don is  slowly but surely  thinking about where to take the character next should we be so lucky   146  In June 2011  Walt Disney Pictures set a July 26  2013 release date for Thor 2 with Chris Hemsworth reprising his role as the title hero  Kenneth Branagh will not be returning as director but will likely be involved in some

Patty Jenkins  the director of Monster and the pilot episode of AMC s The Killing entered early negotiations with Marvel Studios and Disney to direct Thor 2  Brian Kirk had been the front runner but opted not to take the job due to creative and financial sticking points that arose during negotiations  153  In the same month  Fiege stated that the sequel would  take Thor literally to other worlds  and would  primarily be the journey of that character  of he and Jane Foster and how the new dynamic with his father is working out  as well as what are the broader stakes for The Nine Worlds   154  In October 2011  Joshua Dallas  who portrayed Fandral  stated he plans to return to Asgard in Thor 2  155  On October 13  2011  Disney moved the release date for Thor 2 to November 15  2013  156  The

158  She stated   I have had a great time working at Marvel  We parted on very good terms  and I look forward to working with them again   159  Three days later  The Hollywood Reporter reported that Marvel is looking at Alan Taylor and Daniel Minahan as prospect directors to replace Jenkins  THR also reported that Marvel is in the midst of hiring a writer to rewrite Don Payne s script and the shortlist of possible writers consists of John Collee  Robert Rodat  and Roger Avary  160  At the end of the month  Alan Taylor  best known for directing episodes of the HBO fantasy series Game Of Thrones  was chosen to direct the sequel  161  In January 2012  Tom Hiddleston stated that filming is expected begin in London in the summer of 2012  162  Also in January  it was reported that Marvel Studios hired Saving Private Ryan scribe Robert Rodat to rewrite Thor 2  163  The following day  Jaimie Alexander who portrayed Sif stated   I ve had few discussions about Thor 2  I m definitely going to be a part of it so that will be fun  And we just got Alan Taylor from Game of Thrones to direct so we re really excited  I m excited to see what he brings   164   edit  References   a b Per indicia
