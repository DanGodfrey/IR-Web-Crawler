Wells was born on 1 October 1935 in Walton on Thames  Surrey  England  4  Her mother  Barbara Ward Wells  n e Morris   was married to Edward Charles  Ted  Wells  a teacher of metalwork and woodwork  but Andrews was conceived as a result of an affair her mother had with a family friend  5  6  With the outbreak of World War II  Barbara and Ted Wells went their separate ways  Ted Wells assisted with evacuating children to Surrey during the Blitz  while Barbara joined Ted Andrews in entertaining the troops through the good offices of the Entertainments National Service Association  ENSA   Barbara and Ted Wells were soon divorced  They both remarried  Barbara to Ted Andrews  in 1939  and Ted Wells to a former hairstylist working a lathe at a war work factory that employed them both in Hinchley Wood  Surrey  6  7  Andrews lived briefly with Ted Wells and her brother John in Surrey  In about 1940  Ted Wells sent her to live with her mother and stepfather  who  the elder Wells thought  would be better able to provide for his talented daughter s artistic training  According to her 2008 autobiography Home  while Julie had been used to calling Ted Andrews  Uncle Ted   her mother suggested it would be more appropriate to refer to her stepfather as  Pop   while her father remained  Dad  or  Daddy  to her  Julie disliked this change  The Andrews family was  very poor and we lived in a bad slum area of London   Andrews recalled  adding   That was a very black period in my life   In addition  according to Andrews  2008 memoir  her stepfather was an alcoholic  Ted Andrews twice  while drunk  tried to get into bed with his stepdaughter  resulting in Andrews putting a lock on her door  8  But  as the stage career of Ted and Barbara Andrews improved  they were able to afford to move to better surroundings  first to Beckenham and then  as the war ended  back to the Andrews  home town of Hersham  The Andrews family took up residence at the Old Meuse  in West Grove  Hersham  now demolished  a house where Andrews  maternal grandmother happened to have served as a maid  7  Julie Andrews  stepfather sponsored lessons for her  first at the Cone Ripman School  an independent arts educational school in London  then with the famous concert soprano and voice instructor Madame Lilian Stiles Allen   She had an enormous influence on me   Andrews said of Stiles Allen  adding   She was my third mother   I ve got more mothers and fathers than anyone in the world   In her memoir Julie Andrews   My Star Pupil  Stiles Allen records   The range  accuracy and tone of Julie s voice amazed me     she had possessed the rare gift of absolute pitch  9   though Andrews herself refutes this in her 2008 autobiography Home   6  10  According to Andrews   Madame was sure that I could do Mozart and Rossini  but  to be honest  I never was   11  Of her own voice  she says  I had a very pure  white  thin voice  a four octave range   dogs would come for miles around   11  After Cone Ripman School  Andrews continued her academic education at the nearby Woodbrook School  a local state school in Beckenham  12   edit  Career  edit  Early career in the United Kingdom Julie Andrews performed spontaneously and unbilled on stage with her parents for about two years beginning in 1945   Then came the day when I was told I must go to bed in the afternoon because I was going to be allowed to sing with Mummy and Pop in the evening   Andrews explained  She would stand on a beer crate to reach the mic and sing  sometimes a solo or as a duet with her stepfather  while her mother played piano   It must have been ghastly  but it seemed to go down all right   13  14  Julie Andrews got her big break when her stepfather introduced her to Val Parnell  whose Moss Empires controlled prominent venues in London  Andrews made her professional solo debut at the London Hippodrome singing the difficult aria  Je Suis Titania  from Mignon as part of a musical revue called  Starlight Roof  on 22 October 1947  She played the Hippodrome for one year  6  15  Andrews recalled  Starlight Roof  saying   There was this wonderful American person and comedian  Wally Boag  who made balloon animals  He would say   Is there any little girl or boy in the audience who would like one of these   And I would rush up onstage and say   I d like one  please   And then he would chat to me and I d tell him I sang    I was fortunate in that I absolutely stopped the show cold  I mean  the audience went crazy   16  On 1 November 1948  Julie Andrews became the youngest solo performer ever to be seen in a Royal Command Variety Performance  at the London Palladium  where she performed along with Danny Kaye  the Nicholas Brothers and the comedy team George and Bert Bernard for members of King George VI s family  17  18  Julie Andrews followed her parents into radio and television  19  She reportedly made her television debut on the BBC programme RadiOlympia Showtime on 8 October 1949  20

theatre at the London Casino  where she played one year each as Princess Badroulbadour in Aladdin and the egg in Humpty Dumpty  She also appeared on provincial stages across United Kingdom in Jack and the Beanstalk and Little Red Riding Hood  as well as starring as the lead role in Cinderella  19  In 1950 at the age of 14  Andrews was asked to sing at a party of a family friend  Katherine Norwalk  and it was then that she learned that Ted Wells was not her biological father  6  7   edit  Early career in the United States On 30 September 1954 on the eve of her 19th birthday  Julie Andrews made her Broadway debut portraying  Polly Browne  in the already highly successful London musical The Boy Friend  2  To the critics  Andrews was the stand out performer in the show  21  Near the end of her

made for television film  High Tor  23  Andrews auditioned for a part in the Richard Rodgers musical Pipe Dream  Although Rodgers wanted her for Pipe Dream  he advised her to take the part in the Frederick Loewe and Alan Jay Lerner musical My Fair Lady if it were offered to her  In 1956  she appeared on stage in My Fair Lady as Eliza Doolittle to Rex Harrison s Henry Higgins  Rodgers was so impressed with Andrews  talent that concurrent with her run in My Fair Lady  she was featured in the Rodgers and Hammerstein television musical  Cinderella  21 Cinderella was broadcast live on CBS on

1960 Lerner and Loewe again cast her in a period musical as Queen Guinevere in Camelot  with Richard Burton and newcomer Robert Goulet  However film studio head Jack Warner decided Andrews lacked sufficient name recognition for her casting in the film version of My Fair Lady  Eliza was played by the established film actress Audrey Hepburn instead  As Warner later recalled  the decision was easy   In my business I have to know who brings people and their money to a movie theatre box office  Audrey Hepburn had never made a financial flop   27  Andrews and her husband headed back to Britain in September 1962 to await the birth of daughter Emma Katherine Walton  who was born in London two months later  28   edit  Film superstardom The handprints of Julie Andrews in front of
