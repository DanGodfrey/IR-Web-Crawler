Erwin Johannes Eugen Rommel 1   15 November 1891   14 October 1944   popularly known as the Desert Fox  W stenfuchs   listen  help info    was a German Field Marshal of World War II  He won the respect of both his own troops and the enemies he fought  He was a highly decorated officer in World War I  and was awarded the Pour le M rite for his exploits on the Italian front  In World War II  he further distinguished himself as the commander of the 7th Panzer Division during the 1940 invasion of France  However  it was his leadership of German and Italian forces in the North African campaign that established the legend of the Desert Fox  He is considered to have been one of the most skilled commanders of desert warfare in the conflict  2  page needed  He later commanded the German forces opposing the Allied cross channel invasion in Normandy  As one of the few generals who consistently fought the Western Allies  he was never assigned to the Eastern Front   Rommel is regarded as having been a humane and professional officer  His Afrikakorps was never accused of war crimes  Soldiers captured during his Africa campaign were reported to have been treated humanely  Furthermore  he ignored orders to kill captured commandos  Jewish soldiers and civilians in all theaters of his command  3  Late in the war  Rommel was linked to the conspiracy to kill Adolf Hitler  Because Rommel was widely renowned  Hitler chose to eliminate him quietly  in trade for assurances his family would be spared  Rommel agreed to commit suicide  Contents 1 Early life and career 2 World

Empire   He was baptised on 17 November 1891  He was the second child of the Protestant headmaster of the secondary school at Aalen  Professor Erwin Rommel Senior  1860 1913   and Helene von Luz  who had two other sons and a daughter  Rommel wrote that  my early years passed quite happily   At age 14  Rommel and a friend built a full scale glider that was able to fly short distances  Rommel even considered becoming an engineer and throughout his life displayed extraordinary technical aptitude  Acceding to his father s wishes  Rommel instead joined the local 124th W rttemberg Infantry Regiment as an officer cadet in 1910 and was sent to the Officer Cadet School in Danzig  He graduated on 15 November 1911 and was commissioned as a lieutenant in January 1912  While at Cadet School  Rommel met his future wife  17 year old Lucia Maria Mollin  commonly called Lucie   They married on 27 November 1916 in Danzig and on 24 December 1928 had a son  Manfred Rommel  who later became the Mayor of Stuttgart  Some historians believe Rommel also had a relationship with Walburga Stemmer in 1913  which allegedly produced a daughter  Gertrud  4   edit  World War I During World War I  Rommel fought in France as well as in Romania  see  Romanian Campaign  and Italy  see  Italian Campaign   first in the 6th W rttemberg Infantry Regiment  but through most of the war in the W rttemberg Mountain Battalion of the elite Alpenkorps  He gained a reputation for great courage  making quick tactical decisions and taking advantage of enemy confusion  He was wounded three times and awarded the Iron Cross  First and Second Class  Rommel also received Prussia s highest award  the order of Pour le M rite  after fighting in the Battles of the Isonzo in the north eastern Alps on the Isonzo river front  The award was for the Battle of Longarone and the capture of Mount Matajur and its Italian defenders  which totalled 150 officers  9 000 men  and 81 artillery pieces  In contrast  Rommel s detachment suffered only 6 dead and 30 wounded during the two engagements  a remarkable achievement  For a time  Rommel served in the same infantry regiment as Friedrich Paulus  who like Rommel rose to the rank of Field Marshal during World War II  While fighting at Isonzo  Rommel was caught behind Italian lines but managed to escape capture  though almost all of his staff were taken prisoner  In the Second World War  when the Germans and Italians were allies  Rommel tempered his initial disdain of Italian soldiers  when he realized that their lack of success was principally due to poor leadership and equipment  When these difficulties were overcome they were equal to German forces  5  Erwin Rommel wrote a book  Infanterie Greift An  Infantry Attacks   in which he examined and analyzed the many battles he fought in during World War I  It was published in 1937 and became essential reading for both German and allied commanders during World War II  He taught his men to dig in whenever they paused for any length of time  This paid off many times when French artillery fired upon his position  only to be shrugged off by the entrenchments built by Rommel s men   edit  Career between the world wars This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Rommel turned down a post in the Truppenamt  the camouflaged General Staff   whose existence was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles the normal path for advancing to high rank in the German army  Instead  he preferred to remain a frontline officer  Rommel held battalion commands and was an instructor at the Dresden Infantry School from 1929 to 1933  In 1934  his book for infantry training   Gefechts Aufgaben f r Zug und Kompanie   Ein Handbuch f r den Offizierunterricht   Combat tasks for platoon and company  A manual for the officer instruction   appeared  This book was printed until 1945 in five editions  with revisions and changes of title  From 1935 to 1938  Rommel held commands at the Potsdam War Academy  Rommel s war diaries  Infanterie greift an  Infantry Attacks   published in 1937  became a highly regarded military textbook and attracted the attention of Adolf Hitler  who placed Rommel in charge of the War Ministry liaison with the Hitler Youth  Hitler Jugend   Headquarters of Military Sports  the branch involved with paramilitary activities  primarily terrain exercises and marksmanship  Rommel applied himself energetically to the task  The army provided instructors to the Hitler Youth Rifle School in Thuringia  which in turn supplied qualified instructors to the HJ s regional branches  In 1937  Rommel conducted a tour of Hitler Youth meetings and encampments and delivered lectures on German soldiering while inspecting facilities and exercises  Simultaneously  he was pressuring Baldur von Schirach  the Hitler Youth leader  to accept an agreement expanding the army s involvement in Hitler Youth training  Schirach interpreted this as a bid to turn the Hitler Youth into an army auxiliary  a  junior army  in his words  He refused and denied Rommel  whom he had come to dislike personally  apparently out of envy for his  real soldier s  appeal  access to the Hitler Youth  An agreement was concluded  but on a far more limited scope than Rommel sought  cooperation was restricted to the army s providing personnel to the rifle school  By 1939 the Hitler Youth had 20 000 rifle instructors  Simultaneously  Rommel retained his place at Potsdam  Rommel was awarded the highest war ribbons for excellent performance  In 1938 Rommel  now a colonel  was appointed Kommandant  commander  of the War Academy at Wiener Neustadt  Theresian Military Academy   Rommel was removed after a short time  however  to take command of Adolf Hitler s personal protection battalion  F hrerBegleitbataillon   assigned to protect him in the special railway train  F hrersonderzug  used during his visits to occupied Czechoslovakia and Memel  It was during this period that he met and befriended Joseph Goebbels  the Reich s minister of propaganda  Goebbels became a fervent admirer of Rommel and later ensured that Rommel s exploits were celebrated in the media   edit  World War II  edit  Poland 1939 Rommel with Hitler  von Reichenau and Bormann in Poland  September 1939  Rommel acted as commander of the F hrerbegleithauptquartier  F hrer escort headquarters  during the Poland campaign  often moving up close to the front in the F hrersonderzug and seeing much of Hitler  After the Polish defeat  Rommel returned to Berlin to organize the F hrer s victory parade  taking part himself as a member of Hitler s entourage  During the Polish campaign  Rommel was asked to intervene on behalf of one of his wife s relatives  a Polish priest who had been arrested  When Rommel applied to the Gestapo for information  the Gestapo found no information about the man s existence   edit  France 1940  edit  Panzer commander Portrait of Generalfeldmarschall Rommel Rommel asked Hitler for command of a panzer division  On 6 February 1940  three months before the invasion of France  Rommel was given command of the 7th Panzer Division  for Fall Gelb   Case Yellow    the invasion of France and the Low Countries  This promotion provoked resentment among some of his fellow officers  Rommel s initial request for command had been rejected by the Chief of Army Personnel  who cited his lack of previous experience with armored units and his extensive prior experience in an Alpine unit made him a more suitable candidate to assume command of a mountain division that had recent need to fill its commanding officer post  6  Rommel had  however  emphasized the use of mobile infantry and recognized the great usefulness of armoured forces in the Poland campaign  He set about learning and developing the techniques of armoured warfare with great enthusiasm  7  The decision to place him in command of an armoured division was borne out to be an excellent one  In May  1940 his 7th Panzer Division became known as the  Ghost Division  because its rapid advances and fast paced attacks often placed them so far forward that they were frequently out of communication with the rest of the German army   edit  Invasion of France and Belgium On 10 May 1940 a part of XV Corps under General Hoth advanced into Belgium to proceed to the Meuse river near the Walloon municipality of Dinant  At the Meuse  7th Panzer was held up owing to the bridges having been destroyed and to determined sniper and artillery fire from the Belgian defenders  The Germans lacked smoke grenades  so Rommel  having assumed personal command of the crossing  ordered a few nearby houses to be set on fire to conceal the attack  The German Panzergrenadiers crossed the river in rubber boats  with Rommel leading the second wave  8  The Division dashed further inland  always spurred on by Rommel and far in front of any friendly forces  Rommel s technique of pushing forward boldly  ignoring risks to his flanks and rear and relying on the shock to enemy morale to hinder attacks on his vulnerable flanks  paid large dividends during his rapid march across France  9  When encountering resistance  Rommel would simply order his tanks forward  all guns blazing  relying on the shock of the sudden assault to force the enemy to surrender  This method offset the disadvantage the German tanks had in terms of armour and low calibre guns  often causing large formations of enemy heavy tanks to simply give up a fight they would otherwise have had a good chance of winning  10  This approach  although it saved lives on both sides by avoiding prolonged engagements  did cause mishaps  On one occasion his tanks  following this tactic  closed with a convoy of French trucks and fired into them only to realise that the trucks were acting as ambulances ferrying wounded from the front  10   edit  Battle of Arras By 18 May the Division had captured Cambrai  but here Rommel s advance was checked briefly  His chief of staff  still with the unmotorized part of the Division in Belgium and not having received radio reports from Rommel  had written off Rommel and his combat group as lost and so had not arranged for fuel to be sent up  11  There was a degree of controversy over this issue  with Rommel furious at what he perceived as a negligent attitude on the part of his supply officers  whereas his chief of staff was critical of Rommel s failure to keep his staff officers informed of his actions  Rommel in the Western Europe campaign  June 1940  On 20 May Rommel s tanks reached Arras  Here he wanted to cut off the British Expeditionary Force from the coast and Hans von Luck  commanding the reconnaissance battalion of the Division  was tasked with forcing a crossing over the La Bass e canals near the city  Supported by Stuka dive bombers  the unit managed to cross whereupon the British launched a counterattack  the Battle of Arras  on 21 May  Facing the British Matilda tanks  the Germans found their 3 7 cm guns useless against the heavy armour and a battery of 88 mm guns had to be brought up to deal with the threat  with Rommel personally directing the fire  After Arras  Hitler ordered his tanks to hold their positions  while the British  in Operation Dynamo  evacuated their troops at Dunkirk  and the 7th Panzer Division was given a few days of much needed rest  On 26 May  7th Panzer continued its advance  reaching Lille on 27 May  For the assault on the town  General Hoth placed his other tank division  5th Panzer Division  under Rommel s command  to the chagrin of its commander  General Max von Hartlieb  12  The same day  Rommel received news that he had been awarded the Knight s Cross of the Iron Cross  the first divisional commander to be so honoured during the campaign  This award  which had been secured for Rommel at Hitler s behest  caused more animosity among fellow officers  who were critical of Rommel s close relationship with Hitler  They believed that this was further evidence that Hitler seemed to give Rommel preferential treatment  12  On 28 May  while making the final push into Lille and far in front of friendly forces  7th Panzer came under heavy fire from French artillery  Rommel drove his forces on  capturing Lille  trapping half of the French First Army  and preventing their retreat to Dunkirk  After this coup  Rommel s forces were again given time to rest   edit  Drive for the English Channel Rommel  resuming his advance on 5 June  drove for the River Seine to secure the bridges near Rouen  Advancing 100 kilometres  62 mi  in two days  the division reached Rouen only to find the bridges destroyed  On 10 June  Rommel reached the coast near Dieppe  sending his  Am at coast  signal to the German HQ  On 15 June  7th Panzer started advancing on Cherbourg  On 17 June  the Division advanced 35 kilometres  22 mi   capturing the town on the following day  The Division then proceeded towards Bordeaux but stopped when the armistice was signed on 21 June  In July  the Division was sent to the Paris area to start preparations for Operation Seel we  Sea Lion the planned invasion of Britain  The preparations were half hearted  however  as it soon became clear that the Luftwaffe would not be able to secure air superiority over the Royal Air Force   edit  Ghost Division Erwin Rommel at a Paris victory parade  June 1940  7  Panzer Division was later nicknamed Gespenster Division  the  Ghost Division    because of the speed and surprise it was consistently able to achieve  to the point that even the German High Command at times lost track of its whereabouts  It also set the record for the longest thrust in one day by tanks up to that point  covering nearly 320 kilometres  200 mi   Rommel received both praise and criticism for his tactics during the French campaign  Many  such as General Georg Stumme  who had previously commanded 7th Panzer Division  were impressed with the speed and success of Rommel s drive  however  others were more reserved  some out of envy  others because they felt Rommel took unnecessary risks  Hermann Hoth publicly expressed praise for Rommel s achievements but had private reservations  saying in a confidential report that Rommel should not be given command over a corps unless he gained  greater experience and a better sense of judgment   13  Hoth also accused Rommel of an unwillingness to acknowledge the contributions of others to his victories  The Fourth Army commander  General G nther von Kluge  also criticised Rommel for falsely claiming all the glory for his achievements  Rommel did not  Kluge felt  acknowledge the contribution of the Luftwaffe  and Rommel s manuscript describing his campaign in France misrepresented the advances of neighbouring units to elevate the achievements of his own dazzling advances  Kluge also cited the complaint by General Hartlieb that Rommel had misappropriated 5th Panzer s bridging tackle on 14 May after his own supplies had run out in order to cross the Meuse  delaying 5th Panzer for several hours  14  Rommel had repeated this procedure on 27 May at the River Scarpe crossing   edit  North Africa 1941 1943 Rommel s reward for his success was to be promoted and appointed commander of the 5th Light Division  later reorganised and redesignated 21 Panzer Division  and of the 15 Panzer Division which  as the Deutsches Afrikakorps   listen  help info   were sent to Libya in early 1941 in Operation Sonnenblume to aid the demoralised Italian troops which had suffered a heavy defeat from British Commonwealth forces in Operation Compass  It was in Africa where Rommel achieved his greatest fame as a commander   edit  First Axis offensive The Western Desert area  showing Rommel s first offensive 24 March   15 June 1941  His campaign in North Africa earned Rommel the nickname  The Desert Fox   On 6 February 1941 Rommel was ordered to lead the Afrika Korps  sent to Italian Libya to help shore up the Italian forces which had been driven back during Operation Compass  launched by British Commonwealth forces under Major General Richard O Connor during December 1940  Initially ordered to assume a defensive posture and hold the front line  the Axis High Command had slated a limited offensive towards Agedabia and Benghazi for May  planning then to hold the line between those cities  Rommel argued that such a limited offensive would be ineffective  as the whole of Cyrenaica would have to be captured if the front lines were to be held  15  The task of even holding the remaining Italian possessions seemed daunting  as the Italians had only 7 000 troops remaining in the area after O Connor s successful capture of 130 000 prisoners and almost 400 tanks during the previous three months of advance  16  On 24 March 1941 Rommel launched a limited offensive with only the 5th Light Division supported by two Italian divisions  This thrust was to be minor  in anticipation of Rommel receiving the 15th Panzer Division in May  The British  who had been weakened by troops being withdrawn to fight in the Battle of Greece  fell back to Mersa el Brega and started constructing defensive works  Rommel decided to continue the attack against these positions in order to prevent the British from building up the fortifications  17  After a day of fierce fighting  the Germans prevailed and the advance continued as Rommel disregarded holding off the attack on Agedabia until May  The British Commander in Chief Middle East Command  General Archibald Wavell  overestimating the strength of the Axis forces and already apprehensive about the extent of his advances during the previous winter  ordered a withdrawal from Benghazi in early April to avoid being cut off by Rommel s thrust  Rommel  seeing the British reluctance to fight a decisive action  decided on a bold move  the seizure of the whole of Cyrenaica despite having only light forces  He ordered the Italian Ariete armoured division to pursue the retreating British while the 5th Light Division was to move on Benghazi  Generalmajor Johannes Streich  the 5th Light Division s commander  protested this order on the grounds of the state of his vehicles  but Rommel brushed the objections aside because  in his words   One cannot permit unique opportunities to slip by for the sake of trifles   18  The Italian Commander in Chief  General Italo Gariboldi  tried repeatedly to halt Rommel s advance but was unable to contact him  19  After Benghazi had been secured following the British withdrawal  Cyrenaica as far as Gazala was captured by 8 April  This was despite fervent protests from Italian GHQ  which felt Rommel was going beyond his orders  especially since he was supposedly under Italian command  Rommel had received orders from the German High Command that he was not to advance past Maradah  but he turned a blind eye to this as well as to protests from some of his staff and divisional commanders  He believed he was grasping a great possibility to largely destroy the Allied presence in North Africa and capture Egypt  Rommel decided to keep up the pressure on the retreating British and launched an outflanking offensive on the important port of Tobruk 20  during which he managed to capture on 9 April the Military Governor of Cyrenaica  Lieutenant General Philip Neame as well as O Connor  who at this time was his advisor  With Italian forces attacking along the coast  Rommel decided to sweep around to the south and attack the harbour from the southeast with the 5th Light Division  hoping to trap the bulk of the enemy force there  This outflanking could not be carried out as rapidly as was necessary owing to logistical problems from lengthening supply lines and spoiling flank attacks from Tobruk  so Rommel s plan failed  By 11 April the envelopment of Tobruk was complete and the first attack was launched  Other forces continued pushing east  reaching Bardia and securing the whole of Libya by 15 April   edit  Siege of Tobruk 1941  British Matilda tanks move forward at Tobruk  The following siege of Tobruk lasted 240 days  with the garrison consisting of the Australian 9th Division under Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead and reinforced by all the British troops who had withdrawn to the port city  bringing the defenders to a total of 25 000  Impatient to secure success  Rommel launched repeated small scale attacks  These were easily defeated by the defenders  Rommel later criticised the Italian High Command for failing to provide him with the blueprints of the port s fortifications  which the Italians had built before the war   but this was due to his surprising advance so far beyond the agreed point  hardly allowing them time to produce the plans  Reflecting on this period  General Heinrich Kirchheim  then commander of the 5th Light Division  said   I do not like to be reminded of that time because so much blood was needlessly shed   citation needed  Kirchheim had been reluctant to launch further attacks on Tobruk  as the costs of earlier assaults had been very high citation needed   Rommel s Africa tunic  Deutsches Panzermuseum Munster  Rommel remained optimistic that success was imminent  In his memoirs  he claimed that he immediately realised that the enemy was determined to cling to Tobruk  however  this seems to be in doubt  In a letter to his wife dated 16 April  21  he wrote that the enemy was already abandoning the town by sea  and he remained confident that the enemy were not going to defend the town until well into April  22  In reality  the ships arriving at the port were not evacuating the defenders but unloading supplies and even some reinforcements  A letter of his written on 21 April  23  suggests that he was beginning to realise this while the arrival of the Italian blueprints of fortifications provided further grounds for discouragement  Nonetheless  Rommel continued to insist that success was imminent  His relations with his subordinate commanders were at their nadir at this point  especially with Streich  who was openly critical of Rommel s decisions and refused to assume any responsibility for the attacks  Rommel began holding a series of courts martial  though ultimately he signed almost none of the verdicts  This state of affairs led Army Chief Walther von Brauchitsch to write to him that instead of making threats and requesting the replacement of officers who  hitherto had excelled in battle   rather      a calm and constructive debate might bring better results   Rommel remained unmoved  At this point Rommel requested reinforcements for a renewed attack  but the High Command  then completing preparations for Operation Barbarossa  could not spare any  When Chief of Staff General Franz Halder also told Rommel before the latter left for Africa that a larger force could not be logistically sustained  Rommel had responded  that s your pigeon   Now Halder sarcastically commented   Now at last he is constrained to state that his forces are not sufficiently strong to allow him to take full advantage of the  unique opportunities  offered by the overall situation  That is the impression we have had for quite some time over here   24  Angry that his order not to advance beyond Maradah had been disobeyed and alarmed at mounting losses  Halder  never an admirer of Rommel  dispatched Friedrich Paulus to  in Halder s words   head off this soldier gone stark mad   25  Upon arrival on 27 April  Paulus was initially persuaded to authorise yet another attack on Tobruk  Back in Berlin  Halder wrote   In my view it is a mistake  but deferred to Paulus  When the attack  launched on 4 May  seemed to turn into a disaster  Paulus intervened and ordered it halted  In addition  he now forbade Rommel from committing forces in any new attack on Tobruk and further ordered that the attacks were to halt until regrouping was completed  No new assault was to take place without OKH s specific approval  Rommel with the 15th Panzer Division between Tobruk and Sidi Omar  Libya  Rommel was furious with what he perceived as the lack of fighting spirit in his commanders and Italian allies  However  on the insistence of Paulus and Halder  he held off further attacks until the detailed plans of the Tobruk defences could be obtained  the 15th Panzer Division could be brought up to support the attack  and more training of his troops in positional warfare could be conducted  23  26  page needed  For Streich  however  it was too late  He was transferred from command of 5th Light Division  When he met Rommel for the last time as he was taking his leave  Rommel told him that he had been  too concerned for the well being of your troops   Streich shot back   I can recognise no greater words of praise   and a new quarrel ensued  citation needed  After the decision was made to hold off attacks on Tobruk for an indefinite period  Rommel set about creating defensive positions  with Italian infantry forces holding Bardia  the Sollum Sidi Omar line and investing Tobruk  The mobile German and Italian formations were held in reserve to fight any British attacks from Egypt  To this end  Halfaya Pass was secured  the high water mark of Rommel s offensive  An elaborately prepared great assault was scheduled for 21 November 1941  but this attack never took place  Whereas the defenders of Tobruk could be supplied by sea  the logistical problems of the Afrika Korps greatly hampered its operations  and a concentrated counterattack southwards by the besieged Allies might have succeeded in reaching El Adam and severing the lines of communication and supply of the Axis forces at Bardia  Sollum and Halfya covering the Egyptian border  General Morshead  however  was misled by intelligence overestimates of the German forces investing Tobruk  and so no major action was attempted  General Wavell made two unsuccessful attempts to relieve Tobruk  Operation Brevity  launched on 15 May 1941  and Operation Battleaxe  launched on 15 June 1941   Both operations were easily defeated  as they were hastily prepared  partly owing to Churchill s impatience for speedy action  During Brevity the important Halfaya Pass was briefly recaptured by the British but was lost again on 27 May  Battleaxe resulted in the loss of 87 British for 25 German tanks in a four day battle raging on the flanks of the Sollum and Halfaya Passes  with the British being unable to take these well fortified positions  27  In August  Rommel was appointed commander of the newly created Panzer Group Africa  His previous command  the Afrika Korps  comprising the 15th Panzer Division and the 5th Light Division  which by then had been redesignated 21st Panzer Division  was put under command of Generalleutnant Ludwig Cr well  with Fritz Bayerlein as chief of staff  In addition to the Afrika Korps  Rommel s Panzer Group had the 90th Light Division and six Italian divisions  the Ariete and Trieste Divisions forming the Italian XX Motorized Corps  three infantry divisions investing Tobruk  and one holding Bardia   edit  Operation Crusader  edit  Allied counter offensive Rommel conversing with his staff near El Agheila  January 12  1942  Following the costly failure of Battleaxe  Wavell was replaced by the Commander in Chief of India  General Claude Auchinleck  Allied forces were reorganised and strengthened to two corps  XXX and XIII  and became the British Eighth Army under the command of Alan Cunningham  Auchinleck  having 770 tanks and 1 000 aircraft to support him  launched a major offensive to relieve Tobruk  Operation Crusader  on 18 November 1941  Rommel had two armoured divisions  the 15th and 21st with a total of 260 tanks  the 90th Light Infantry division  and three Italian corps  five infantry and one armoured division with 154 tanks  with which to oppose him  The Eighth Army deeply outflanked the German defences along the Egyptian frontier with a left hook through the desert  and reached a position from which they could strike at both Tobruk and the coastal road  the  Via Balbia   Auchinleck planned to engage the Afrika Korps with his armoured division  while XXX Corps assaulted the Italian positions at Bardia  encircling the troops there  But the British operational plan had one major flaw  When XXX corps reached the area of Qabr Salih  it was assumed that the Afrika Korps would attack eastward  allowing the British to surround them with a southerly armour thrust  Rommel  however  did not find it necessary to do as the British planned  and instead attacked the southernly armoured thrust at Sidi Rezegh  28  Rommel was now faced with the decision of whether to continue the planned attack on Tobruk in late May  trusting his screening forces to hold off the advancing British  or to reorient his forces to hit the approaching British columns  He decided the risks were too great and called off the attack on Tobruk  29  The British armoured thrusts were largely defeated by fierce resistance from antitank positions and tanks  The Italian Ariete Armoured Division was forced to give ground while inflicting heavy losses on the advancing British at Bir el Gobi  whereas the 21st Panzer Division checked the attack launched against them and counterattacked on Gabr Saleh  nb 1  Over the next two days the British continued pressing their attack  sending their armoured brigades into battle in a piecemeal fashion  31  while Rommel  aware of his numerical inferiority  launched a concentrated attack on 23 November with all his armour  The 21st Panzer Division held their defensive positions at Sidi Rezegh  while 15th Panzer Division and the Italian Ariete Division attacked the flanks and enveloped the British armour  During this battle  among the biggest armoured battles of the North African campaign  the British tanks were surrounded  with about two thirds destroyed and the survivors having to fight themselves out of the trap and head south to Gabr Saleh  32   edit  Rommel s counterattacks On 24 November Rommel  wanting to exploit the halt of the British offensive  counterattacked into the British rear areas in Egypt with the intention of exploiting the disorganisation and confusion in the enemy s bases and cutting their supply lines  Rommel considered the other  more conservative  course of action of destroying the British forces halted before Tobruk and Bardia too time consuming  33  Rommel knew his forces were incapable of driving such an effort home  but believed that the British  traumatised by their recent debacle  would abandon their defences along the border at the appearance of a German threat to their rear  34  page needed  General Cunningham did  as Rommel had hoped  decide to withdraw the Eighth Army to Egypt  but Auchinleck arrived from Cairo just in time to cancel the withdrawal orders  35  The German attack  which began with only 100 operational tanks remaining  36  stalled as it outran its supplies and met stiffening resistance  The counterattack was criticised by the German High Command and some of his staff officers as too dangerous with Commonwealth forces still operating along the coast east of Tobruk  and a wasteful attack as it bled his forces  in particular his remaining tank force  Among the Staff officers who were critical was Friedrich von Mellenthin  who said that  Unfortunately  Rommel overestimated his success and believed the moment had come to launch a general pursuit   36  In Rommel s favour  the attack very nearly succeeded  Cunningham ordered a withdrawal  and only Auchinleck s timely intervention prevented this  35   edit  Tobruk relieved  Axis retirement to El Agheila While Rommel drove into Egypt  the remaining Commonwealth forces east of Tobruk threatened the weak Axis lines there  Unable to reach Rommel for several days  nb 2  Rommel s Chief of Staff  Oberstleutnant Westphal  ordered the 21st Panzer Division withdrawn to support the siege of Tobruk  On 27 November the British attack on Tobruk linked up with the defenders  and Rommel  having suffered losses that could not easily be replaced  had to concentrate on retrieving and regrouping the divisions that had attacked into Egypt  By 6 December the Afrika Korps had averted the danger  and on 7 December Rommel fell back to a defensive line at Gazala  just west of Tobruk  all the while under heavy attacks from the RAF  The Italian forces at Bardia and on the Egyptian border were now cut off from the retreating Axis  The Allies  briefly held up at Gazala  kept up the pressure to some degree  although they were almost as exhausted and disorganised as Rommel s force  38  and Rommel was forced to retreat all the way back to the starting positions he had held in March  reaching El Agheila on 30 December  His main concern during his withdrawal was being flanked to the south  so the Afrika Korps held the south flank during the retreat  The Allies followed  but never attempted a southern flanking move to cut off the retreating troops as they had done in 1940  The German Italian garrison at Bardia surrendered on 2 January 1942   edit  Recapture of Gazala On 5 January 1942 the Afrika Korps received 55 tanks and new supplies and Rommel started planning a counterattack  On 21 January the attack was launched  which mauled the Allied forces  costing them some 110 tanks and other heavy equipment  The Axis forces retook Benghazi on 29 January  Timimi on 3 February  and the Allies pulled back to the Tobruk area and commenced building defensive positions at Gazala  During the confusion caused by the Crusader operation  Rommel and his staff found themselves behind Allied lines several times  On one occasion  he visited a New Zealand Army field hospital that was still under Allied control    Rommel  inquired if anything was needed  promised the British  sic  medical supplies and drove off unhindered   39  Eventually  Rommel did supply the medical unit with some medical equipment   edit  Second German offensive  Battle of Gazala Following General Kesselring s successes in creating local air superiority and suppressing the Malta defenders in April 1942  an increased flow of vital supplies reached the Panzer Armee Afrika  Previously it had been receiving about a third of its needed supplies for several months  With his forces thus strengthened  Rommel began planning a major push for the summer  He felt the very strong British positions around Gazala could be outflanked  and he could then drive up behind them and destroy them  40  The British were planning a summer offensive of their own and their dispositions were more suited for an attack rather than a defence  Rommel in North Africa  June 1942  The British had 900 tanks in the area  200 of which were new Grant tanks  whereas Rommel s Panzer Army Africa commanded a mere 320 German  50 of which were the obsolete Panzer II model  and 240 Italian tanks  which were no better than the Panzer IIs  41  Therefore Rommel had to rely predominantly on 88 mm guns to destroy the British heavy tanks  but even these were in short supply  In infantry and artillery Rommel found himself vastly outnumbered also  with many of his units under strength following the campaigns of 1941  In contrast to the previous year  the Axis had more or less air parity  On 26 May 1942 Rommel s army attacked in a classic outflanking Blitzkrieg operation in the Battle of Gazala  His Italian infantry assaulted the Gazala fortifications head on  with some armour attached to give the impressions that this was the main assault  while all his motorized and armoured forces outflanked the positions to the south  On the following morning Rommel cut through the flank and attacked north  but throughout the day a running armour battle occurred  where both sides took heavy losses  The attempted encirclement of the Gazala position failed and the Germans lost a third of their heavy tanks  Renewing the attack on the morning of 28 May  Rommel concentrated on encircling and destroying separate units of the British armour  Heavy British counterattacks forced Rommel to assume a defensive posture and not pursue his original plan of a dash north for the coast  On 30 May he attacked eastwards to link with elements of Italian X Corps which had cleared a path through the Allied minefields to establish a line of supply  On 2 June 90th Light Division and the Trieste Division surrounded and reduced the Allied strongpoint at Bir Hakeim  capturing it on 11 June  With his communications and the southern strongpoint of the British line thus secured  Rommel attacked north again  forcing the British back  relying on the minefields of the Gazala lines to protect his left flank  42  On 14 June the British began a headlong retreat eastwards  the so called  Gazala Gallop   to avoid being completely cut off  On 15 June Axis forces reached the coast eliminating any escape for the Commonwealth forces still occupying the Gazala positions  With this task completed  Rommel set off in pursuit of the retreating Allied formations  aiming to capture Tobruk while the enemy was confused and disorganised  43  Tobruk  isolated and alone  was now all that stood between the Axis and Egypt  The defenders were the 2nd South African Infantry Division and some disorganised units recovering from the Gazala battle  On 21 June  after a swift  coordinated and fierce combined arms assault  the city surrendered along with its 33 000 defenders  including most of the South African 2nd Division  Only at the fall of Singapore  earlier that year  had more British Commonwealth troops been captured  Hitler made Rommel a Field Marshal for this victory  nb 3  By this time  Rommel s gains caused considerable alarm in the Allied camp  He appeared to be poised to deliver a crippling blow to the British by conquering Egypt  The Allies feared Rommel would then turn northeastward to conquer the valuable oil fields of the Middle East and then link up with the German forces besieging the equally valuable Caucasian oil fields  However  these required substantial reinforcements that Hitler refused to allocate  Ironically  Hitler had been sceptical about sending Rommel to Africa in the first place  He d only done so after constant begging by naval commander Erich Raeder  and even then only to relieve the Italians  Hitler never understood global warfare  despite Raeder and Rommel s attempts to get him to see the strategic value of Egypt  44  page needed   edit  Drive for Egypt Field Marshal Erwin Rommel  with his aides during the desert campaign  1942 Rommel determined to press the attack on Mersa Matruh despite the heavy losses he had suffered at Gazala and Tobruk  He also wanted to prevent the British from establishing a new frontline  and felt the weakness of the British formations had to be exploited by a thrust into Egypt  45  This decision met with some criticism  as an advance into Egypt meant a significant lengthening of the supply lines  46  It also meant that a proposed attack on Malta would have to wait  as the Luftwaffe would be required to support Rommel s drive eastwards  Kesselring strongly disagreed with Rommel s decision  and went as far as threatening to withdraw his aircraft to Sicily  47  Hitler agreed to Rommel s plan  despite protest from Italian HQ and some of his staff officers  seeing the potential for a complete victory in Africa  48  Rommel  apparently aware of his growing reputation as a gambler  defended his decision by claiming that merely to hold the lines at Sollum would confer upon the British a distinct advantage  in that they could more easily outflank the positions at Sollum and the overseas supply lines would still have to be routed via Tripoli unless he secured a front further east  49  On 22 June Rommel continued his offensive eastwards and initially little resistance was encountered  Apart from fuel shortages  the advance continued until Mersa Matruh was encircled on 26 June  surrounding four infantry divisions  One of the divisions managed to break out during the night  and over the next two days some elements of the remaining three divisions also slipped away  The fortress fell on 29 June  yielding enormous amounts of supplies and equipment  in addition to 6 000 POWs  50  On 25 June Auchinleck had assumed direct command of Eighth Army and decided to form his main defensive line at El Alamein  where the proximity to the south of the Qattara Depression created a relatively short line to defend which could not be outflanked to the south because of the impossibility of moving armour into and through the depression  Rommel continued his march eastwards  but with the supply situation steadily worsening and his men exhausted after five weeks of constant warfare  the offensive on El Alamein seemed in doubt  On 1 July the First Battle of El Alamein started  but after almost a month of inconclusive fighting both sides  completely exhausted  dug in  halting Rommel s drive eastwards  This was a serious blow to Rommel who had hoped to drive his advance into the open desert beyond El Alamein where he could conduct a mobile defence  51  More significantly  Rommel only had 13 operational tanks by the time he reached El Alamein  Although he was only a few hundred miles from the Pyramids  he knew he didn t have the resources to push forward  On 3 July  he wrote in his diary that his momentum had  faded away   44  page needed   edit  Allied attack  Second Battle of El Alamein  edit  Summer standoff After the stalemate at El Alamein  Rommel hoped to go on the offensive again before massive amounts of men and material could reach the British Eighth Army  Allied forces from Malta were  however  intercepting his supplies at sea and the Desert Air Force kept up a relentless campaign against Axis supply vessels in Tobruk  Bardia and Mersa Matruh  Most of the supplies reaching the Axis troops still had to be landed at Benghazi and Tripoli  and the enormous distances supplies had to travel to reach the forward troops meant that a rapid resupply and reorganisation of the Axis army could not be done  Further hampering Rommel s plans was the fact that the Italian divisions received priority on supplies  with the Italian authorities shipping material for the Italian formations at a much higher rate than for German formations  52  It seems the Italian HQ was uneasy with Rommel s ambitions and wanted their own forces  whom they at least had some control over  resupplied first  53  The British  themselves preparing for a renewed drive  replaced C in C Auchinleck with General Harold Alexander  The Eighth Army also got a new commander  Bernard Montgomery  They received a steady stream of supplies and were able to reorganise their forces  In late August they received a large convoy carrying over 100 000 tons of supplies  and Rommel  learning of this  felt that time was running out  Rommel decided to launch an attack with the 15th and 21st Panzer Division  90th Light Division  and the Italian XX Motorized Corps in a drive through the southern flank of the El Alamein lines  The terrain here was without any easily defensible features and so open to attack  Montgomery and Auchinleck before him had realised this threat  and the main defences for this sector had been set up behind the El Alamein line along the Alam El Halfa Ridge  where any outflanking thrust could be more easily met from overlooking defensive positions   edit  Battle of Alam El Halfa The Battle of Alam el Halfa was launched on 30 August  with Rommel s forces driving through the south flank  After passing the El Alamein line to the south  Rommel drove north at the Alam el Halfa Ridge  just as Montgomery had anticipated  Under heavy fire from British artillery and aircraft  and in the face of well prepared positions that Rommel could not hope to outflank due to lack of fuel  the attack stalled  By 2 September  Rommel realized the battle was unwinnable  and decided to withdraw  54  Montgomery had prepared to pursue the Germans but in the afternoon of 2 September  he gave Corps commander Brian Horrocks clear orders to allow the enemy to retire  This was for two reasons  to preserve his own strength and to allow the enemy to observe  and be misled by  the dummy preparations for an attack in the area  55  Nevertheless  Montgomery was keen to inflict casualties on the enemy and orders were given for the as yet inexperienced 2nd New Zealand Division  positioned to the north of the retreating Axis forces  and 7th Armoured Division to attack on 3 September  The attack was repelled  however  by a fierce rearguard action by the 90th Light Division and Montgomery called off further action to preserve his strength  56  On 5 September Rommel was back where he had started  with only heavy losses to show for it  Rommel had suffered 2 940 casualties  lost 50 tanks  a similar number of guns and  perhaps worst of all  400 trucks  vital for supplies and movement  The British losses  except tank losses of 68  were much less  further adding to the numerical inferiority of Panzer Army Afrika  The Desert Air Force inflicted the highest proportions of damage to Rommel s forces  He now realized the war in Africa was unwinnable without more air support which was impossible since the Luftwaffe was already stretched to breaking point on other fronts  57   edit  Second Battle of El Alamein El Alamein 1942  Destroyed Panzer IIIs near Tel el Eisa In September British raiding parties attacked important harbours and supply points  The flow of supplies successfully ferried across the Mediterranean had fallen to a dismal level  Some two thirds of the supplies embarked for Africa were destroyed at sea  In addition  Rommel s health was failing and he took sick leave in Italy and Germany from late September  Thus he was not present when the Second Battle of El Alamein began on 23 October 1942  Although he returned immediately  it took him two vital days to reach his HQ in Africa  The defensive plan at El Alamein was more static in nature than Rommel preferred  but with shortages of motorized units and fuel  he had felt it was the only possible plan  58  The defensive line had strong fortifications and was protected with a large minefield which in turn was covered with machine guns and artillery  This  Rommel hoped  would allow his infantry to hold the line at any point until motorized and armoured units in reserve could move up and counterattack any Allied breaches  59  General Georg Stumme was in command in Rommel s absence but during the initial fighting he died of a heart attack  This paralyzed the German HQ until General Ritter von Thoma took command  After returning  Rommel learned that the fuel supply situation  critical when he left in September  was now disastrous  60  Counterattacks by the 15th and 21st Panzer Divisions on 24 October and 25 October had incurred heavy tank losses due to the intensity of the British artillery and air attack  Rommel s main concern was to counterattack in full force and throw the British out of the defensive lines  which was in his view the only chance the Axis had of avoiding defeat  61  The counterattack was launched early on 26 October but the British units that had penetrated the defensive line inflicted heavy losses on Rommel s armour at the position code named Snipe  often mis named Kidney Ridge due to faulty interpretation of the ring contour   it was actually a depression   The Allies continued pushing hard with armoured units to force the breakthrough  but the defenders  fire destroyed many tanks  leading to doubts among the officers in the British armoured brigades about the chances of clearing a breach  62  Montgomery  seeing his armoured brigades losing tanks at an alarming rate  stopped major attacks until 2 November when he launched Operation Supercharge and achieved a 4 kilometres  2 5 mi  penetration of the line  Rommel immediately counterattacked with what tanks he had available in an attempt to encircle the pocket during 2 November  but the heavy Allied fire stopped the attempt  By this time Panzer Army Africa had only one third of its initial strength remaining  with only 35 tanks left operational  virtually no fuel or ammunition and with the British in complete command of the air  63   edit  Rommel s retreat On 3 November Montgomery found it impossible to renew his attack  and he had to wait for more reinforcements to be brought up  This lull was what Rommel needed for his withdrawal  which had been planned since 29 October  when he had determined the situation hopeless  63  At midday  however  Rommel received the infamous  victory or death  stand fast order from Hitler  Although this order demanded the impossible and virtually ensured the destruction of Panzer Army Africa  Rommel could not bring himself to disobey a direct order from his F hrer  The Axis forces held on desperately  64  On 4 November Montgomery renewed the attack with fresh forces  and with almost 500 tanks against the 20 or so remaining to Rommel  By midday the Italian XX Motorized Corps was surrounded  and several hours later was completely destroyed  This left a 20 km gap in Rommel s line  with British armoured and motorized units pouring through  threatening the entire Panzer Army Africa with encirclement  At this point Rommel could no longer uphold the no retreat order and ordered a general retreat  Early on 5 November he received authorization by Hitler to withdraw  12 hours after his decision to do so but it was far too late  with only remnants of his army streaming westward  Most of his unmotorized forces  the bulk of the army  were caught  65  Part of the Panzer Army Africa escaped from El Alamein  but this remnant took heavy losses from constant air attacks  Despite urgings from Hitler and Mussolini  the Panzer Army did not turn to fight  except for brief holding actions  but withdrew under Allied pressure all the way to Tunisia  However  the retreat was conducted most skilfully  employing scorched earth tactics and leaving behind booby traps  making the task of the pursuers very difficult  The Allied forces had great numerical superiority and air supremacy  while most of Rommel s remaining divisions were reduced to combat groups  66   edit  End of Africa campaigns This unreferenced section requires citations to

threatening to cut his lines of supply north to Tunis  Rommel inflicted a sharp defeat on the American forces at the Kasserine Pass in February  Rommel immediately turned back against the British forces  occupying the Mareth Line  old French defences on the Libyan border   But Rommel could only delay the inevitable  At the end of January 1943  the Italian General Giovanni Messe had been appointed the new commander of Rommel s Panzer Army Africa while Rommel had been at Kasserine  which was renamed the Italo German Panzer Army  in recognition of the fact that it consisted of one German and three Italian corps   Though Messe replaced Rommel  he diplomatically deferred to him  and the two coexisted in what was theoretically the same command  On 23 February Armeegruppe Afrika was created with Rommel in command  It included the Italo German Panzer Army under Messe  renamed 1st Italian Army  and the German 5th Panzer Army in the north of Tunisia under General Hans J rgen von Arnim  The last Rommel offensive in North Africa was on 6 March 1943  when he attacked Eighth Army at the Battle of Medenine  The attack was made with 10th  15th  and 21st Panzer Divisions  Warned by Ultra intercepts  Montgomery deployed large numbers of anti tank guns in the path of the offensive  After losing 52 tanks  Rommel called off the assault  On 9 March he handed over command of Armeegruppe Afrika to General Hans J rgen von Arnim and left Africa  because of health reasons  never to return  On 13 May 1943  General Messe surrendered the remnants of Armeegruppe Afrika to the Allies  Some historians contrast Rommel s withdrawal to Tunisia against Hitler s wishes with Friedrich Paulus s obedience of orders to have the German Sixth Army stand its ground at the Battle of Stalingrad which resulted in its annihilation  Field Marshal Albert Kesselring  appointed overall Axis commander in North Africa  saw things differently  He believed the withdrawals  some of which were carried out against his orders  unnecessary and ruinous since they brought forward British airfields ever closer to the port of Tunis  As far as he was concerned  Rommel was an insubordinate defeatist and string puller  The increasingly acrimonious relations between the two did nothing to enhance performance  citation needed   edit  Role of Signals Intelligence  SIGINT  in North Africa  edit  Axis The Axis had some major SIGINT successes in North Africa  They intercepted the reports of the U S  military attach  in Egypt  who was briefed by the British on their forces and plans  67  Some authorities believe this information explains much of Rommel s success  In addition  the Afrika Korps had a Radio Intercept Section  RIS  attached to its HQ  The RIS monitored radio communications among British units  The British were very  gabby  and most of this chatter was in clear  that is  uncoded  allowing the Germans to more easily identify British units and deployments  During the first Battle of El Alamein  a British counter attack reached the German HQ  The RIS was wiped out in the fighting and many of their files captured  This alerted the British to the problem  and they tightened up on radio chatter  The loss of this resource is considered an important factor in Rommel s later lack of success  68  page needed   edit  Allies Allied codebreakers read much enciphered German message traffic  especially that encrypted with the Enigma machine  This Ultra intelligence included daily reports from Africa on the numbers and condition of Axis forces  It also

arranged and completed   edit  France 1943 1944 Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel in December 1943  The inglorious end of the North African campaign meshed poorly with the Nazi propaganda machine s relentless portrayal of Rommel as an unbeatable military genius  This opened in Berlin the awkward question of precisely what use now to make of the erstwhile Desert Fox  Back in Germany he was for some time virtually  unemployed   On 23 July 1943 he moved to Greece as commander of Army Group E to defend the Greek coast against a possible Allied landing that never happened  and which the Germans were led to expect due to the elaborate British deception plan known as  Operation Mincemeat  only to return to Germany two days later upon the overthrow of Mussolini  On 17 August 1943 Rommel moved his headquarters from Munich to Lake Garda as commander of a new Army Group B created to defend northern Italy  Rommel inspecting the Indian Legion  February 1944  After Hitler gave Kesselring sole Italian command  on 21 November  Rommel moved Army Group B to Normandy in France with responsibility for defending the French coast against the long anticipated Allied invasion  He was dismayed by the lack of completed works and the slow building pace and feared he had just months before an invasion  Rommel reinvigorated the fortification effort along the Atlantic coast  The Commander in Chief West  Gerd von Rundstedt  expected the Allies to invade in the Pas de Calais because it was the shortest crossing point from Britain  its port facilities were essential to supplying a large invasion force  and the distance from Calais to Germany was relatively short  Hitler s HQ  although agreeing with this assessment  also considered a landing at Normandy as a possibility  69  Rommel  believing that Normandy was indeed a likely landing ground  argued that it did not matter to the Allies where they landed  just that the landing was successful  70  He therefore toured the Normandy defenses extensively in January and February 1944  He ordered millions of mines laid and thousands of tank traps and obstacles set up on beaches and throughout the countryside  including in fields suitable for glider aircraft landings  the so called Rommelspargel   Rommel s asparagus    71  After his experience with Allied air superiority at the end of the North Africa campaign  Rommel concluded that future Allied offensives would also enjoy overwhelming Allied air superiority  exposing any German armoured counter movements to severe punishment from above  He argued that the tank forces should be dispersed in small units and kept in heavily fortified positions as close to the front as possible  In doing so they would not have to move far and en masse when the invasion started  72  He felt their best chance was to confront the invading force immediately and drive it into the sea  However  von Rundstedt felt that there was no way to stop the invasion near the beaches due to the equally overwhelming firepower of the Allied navies  He felt the German armour should be held in reserve well inland near Paris where they could be used to counter attack in force in a more traditional military doctrine  The allies could even be allowed to extend themselves deep into France  exposing their flanks for a pincer movement to cut off the supplies and retreat of the Allied troops  This notion of defending France was supported by other officers  most notably Heinz Guderian and Panzer Group West commander Geyr von Schweppenburg  who strongly disagreed with Rommel and wanted the armour placed far inland  Generalfeldmarschalls Gerd von Rundstedt and Erwin Rommel meeting at the Hotel  George V  in Paris When asked to pick a plan  Hitler vacillated  In late April  he ordered them placed in the middle  far enough inland to be useless to Rommel but not far enough for von Rundstedt  73  Rommel did move some of the armoured formations under his command as far forward as possible  ordering General Erich Marcks  commanding the 84th Corps defending the Normandy section  to move his reserves into the frontline  The Allies staged elaborate deceptions for D Day  see Operation Fortitude   giving the impression that the landings would be at Calais  Although Hitler himself expected a Normandy invasion for a while  Rommel and most Wehrmacht commanders in France also started believing in a Pas de Calais landing  74  Rommel concentrated fortification building in the River Somme estuary and let the work in Normandy lag  By D Day on 6 June 1944 virtually all German officers  including Hitler s staff  firmly believed that Pas de Calais was going to be the invasion site  75  During the confusing opening hours of D Day  the German command structure in France was in disarray  Rommel  and several other important officers were on leave  76  Several tank units  notably the 12th SS Panzer Division and Panzer Lehr Division  were close enough to the beaches to create serious havoc  The absence of Rommel and continued confusion in the army and theater HQs led to hesitation in releasing the armoured reserves to Normandy when they might be needed to meet a second invasion further north  Facing only small scale German attacks  the Allies quickly secured a beachhead  According to the official history of the SAS  a British sniper could have killed Rommel  but was ordered not to  because by that time the allies understood the German s mind and felt they could anticipate his strategies but not that of his unknown successor  77  Rommel personally oversaw the bitter fighting around Caen where only the determined defence of Kampfgruppe von Luck prevented a British breakout on the first day  Here  again  the on site commanders were denied freedom of action and the Germans did not launch a concentrated counterattack until mid day on 6 June  The Allies pushed ashore and expanded their beachhead despite the best efforts of Rommel s troops  By mid July the German position was crumbling  On 17 July 1944  Rommel was being driven along a French road near the front in his staff car  According to a widely accepted version of events  an RCAF Spitfire of 412 Squadron piloted by Charley Fox strafed the car near Sainte Foy de Montgommery and Rommel was injured  78  He was hospitalised with major head injuries  In a different version  a patrol of 602 Squadron led by Chris Le Roux carried out the attack  79  A third version by Australian Fred Cowlph of 453 Squadron claimed the strafing attack  asserting that his guns camera verified this  He recorded this action

Kapelle  Black Orchestra   but Hitler s dazzling successes in 1938 1941 had stifled it  However  after the Russian campaign failed  and the Axis suffered more defeats  this opposition underwent a revival  Early in 1944  three of Rommel s closest friends   the Oberb rgermeister of Stuttgart  Karl Str lin  who had served with Rommel in the First World War   Alexander von Falkenhausen and Carl Heinrich von St lpnagel began efforts to bring Rommel into the conspiracy  They felt that as by far the most popular officer in Germany  he would lend their cause badly needed credibility with the populace  Additionally  the conspirators felt they needed the support of a field marshal on active duty  Erwin von Witzleben  who would have become commander in chief of the Wehrmacht if Hitler had been overthrown  was a field marshal  but had not been on active duty since 1942  Sometime in February  Rommel agreed to lend his support to the conspiracy in order to  as he put it   come to the rescue of Germany   44  page needed  Rommel  however  opposed assassinating Hitler  After the war  his widow among others maintained that Rommel believed an assassination attempt would spark civil war in Germany and Austria and Hitler would have become a martyr for a lasting cause  80  Instead  Rommel insisted that Hitler be arrested and brought to trial for his crimes  By the time of his head

even suspected of participating  Rommel was fairly perturbed at this development  telling Hans Speidel that Hitler s behavior after the attack proved that the dictator had  gone completely mad   It did not take long  however  for Rommel s involvement to come to light  His name was first mentioned when St lpnagel blurted it out after a botched suicide attempt  Later  another conspirator  Caesar von Hofacker  admitted under particularly severe Gestapo torture that Rommel was actively involved  44  page needed  Additionally  Carl Goerdeler  the main civilian leader of the Resistance  wrote on several letters and other documents that Rommel was a potential supporter and an acceptable military leader to be placed in a position of responsibility should their coup succeed  Nazi party officials

men with whom Rommel had crossed swords before  Heinz Guderian and Gerd von Rundstedt  The Court decided that Rommel should be expelled from the Army in disgrace and brought before Roland Freisler s People s Court  a kangaroo court that always decided in favour of the prosecution  However  Hitler knew that having Rommel branded as a traitor would severely damage morale on the home front  He and Keitel thus decided to offer Rommel a chance to commit suicide  44  page needed  Rommel was approached at his home by Wilhelm Burgdorf and Ernst Maisel  two generals from Hitler s headquarters  on 14 October 1944  Burgdorf informed him of the charges and offered him a choice  he could face the People s Court or choose to commit suicide quietly  In the former case  his staff would have been arrested and his family would suffer even before the all but certain conviction and execution  In the latter case  the government would assure his family full pension payments and a state funeral

and strategy Rommel was a skilled tactician  but some allege that he had little sense of logistics or military strategy  86  They consider as an example of this his proposal to postpone Operation Herkules  the invasion of Malta in favour of the immediate advance to the Suez Canal  which would cut the island off from the western Mediterranean  In the event  the operation did not take place  and he ran out of supplies in Egypt  principally because Malta based forces were sinking Axis supply ships  Those that allege that Rommel had little sense of logistics think that his eagerness to drive for Egypt  when the necessary logistical support was lacking  meant that these drives ultimately failed with great losses  In his analysis of the logistical aspects of the North African Campaign  military historian Martin van Creveld wrote  Given that the Wehrmacht was only partly motorized and unsupported by a really strong motor industry  that the political situation necessitated the carrying of much useless Italian ballast  that the capacity of the Libyan ports was so small  the distances to be mastered so vast  it seems clear that  for all of Rommel s tactical brilliance  the problem of supplying an Axis force for an advance into the Middle East was insoluble      Rommel s repeated defiance of his orders and attempts to advance beyond a reasonable distance from his bases  however  was mistaken and should never have been tolerated  87   edit  Personality Contemporaries who had to work with him under adversity often had very few kind words to say about him and his abilities  Following Paulus  return from his inspection of Rommel s doings in North Africa and also considering the reports submitted by Alfred Gause  Halder concluded   Rommel s character defects make him very hard to get along with but no one cares to come out in open opposition because of his brutality and the backing he has at top level   Others mentioned his leadership style  which expected much of his commanders  while not being open to criticism or objections  18  He had little patience for sub commanders who did not do their jobs properly  Only three weeks after assuming command of the 7th Panzer Division in February 1940  Rommel found a battalion commander performing below par and had the man relieved of command and sent on his way in 90 minutes  88  This management style would certainly send a signal that he demanded the utmost of his men  but it was bound to create a feeling of resentment among some of his officers  nb 4  F  W  von Mellenthin  who served on Rommel s staff during the Africa campaign  wrote that Rommel took great chances on several occasions  gambling entire battles on decisions made almost on the spur of the moment and with incomplete information  He cited Rommel s counterattack during Operation Crusader as just one such instance  36  Others who served under him in Africa  most notably General Fritz Bayerlein  said he took risks but only after carefully weighing the potential dangers and rewards  89  Rommel himself was aware of his growing reputation as a gambler and added careful notes in his papers explaining and defending his actions  especially concerning his decision to drive into Egypt during the 1942 Summer Offensive  49  nb 5  While some aggressive subordinates  like Hans von Luck  praised his leadership from the front  8  Mellenthin questioned this leadership style as it often led to disinvolvement of his staff officers in the fight instead of their maintaining an overview of the situation  His consequential long absences from HQ also meant that subordinates had to make decisions without consulting Rommel  leading to confusion  90  Rommel was a teetotaler and a non smoker  91   edit  Relations with the Italians Rommel s relations with the Italian High Command in North Africa were in the worst possible terms  That is hardly surprising  as Rommel was nominally subordinate to the Italians for much of the campaign but was also direct commander of the DAK  by far the strongest component of the Axis forces  and enjoyed direct access and the strongest relationships with the highest German political authority  This allowed him to ignore blatantly any sort of order or even simple advice coming from his Italian counterparts  and Rommel s abrasive and often impolite manners did nothing to smoothe the resentment that this perceived insubordination and lack of respect generated in his Italian allies  92  93  The belated expedient to nominate Field Marshall Kesselring as Supreme Commander Mediterranean  to act as a buffer between Rommel and the Italians  failed miserably  as Rommel quite simply ignored Kesselring exactly as he ignored the Italians  94  Besides Rommel s impolite manners and insubordination  there were also strong professional points of disagreements  mostly related to the handling of the logistical part of the campaign  While certainly much less proficient than Rommel in their tactical outlook and mobile warfare skills  the Italian commanders were competent  old school  professionals  with full staff training and a sound grasp of logistics and artillery doctrine  that is the true weak points of Rommel professional preparation  As such the Italian commanders were repeatedly at odds with Rommel  particularly when their conservative logistical calculations   regularly ignored by Rommel   were actually confirmed as accurate  leaving the Axis forces stranded in exposed position from where the Italians   with their puny motorized resources   were much less able than the Germans to extricate themselves  95  This generated a widespread lack of respect among the Italian commanders for Rommel s professional skills in anything but tactical situation  that further ruined any possibility of implementing good working relations  This lack of trust reached its acme during the retreat up to Tunisia after the El Alamein battle  when an utterly spent and dispirited Rommel eluded all requests by the Italians to stand up and attempt to fight in defence of Libya on the favourable traditional back up line at the el Agheila bottleneck or even before the main logistical base of Tripoli  a fact that the Italian commanders did consider just short of outright cowardice and treason  Much different was the perception of Rommel among the Italian common soldiers and lower officers  that reserved for him the highest sort of admiration and respect   edit  Aggression and tactical capability In France  Rommel s aggressive drive through the French and British lines  disregarding the safety of his flanks and rear  succeeded to a remarkable degree  His bold attacks often caused larger enemy formations to surrender  but his aggressiveness did cause resentment among fellow officers  who felt he at times acted too recklessly and failed to keep his sub commanders and colleague commanders properly informed of his intentions  He was also criticized for claiming too much of the glory himself  neglecting support from other elements of the Wehrmacht and downplaying other units  achievements  British General Harold Alexander commanded Allied forces in the Middle East facing Rommel in Egypt  from August 1942  and later commanded 18th Army Group in Tunisia  In his official despatch on the campaign in Africa  he wrote of Rommel   He was a tactician of the greatest ability  with a firm grasp of every detail of the employment of armour in action  and very quick to seize the fleeting opportunity and the critical turning point of a mobile battle  I felt certain doubts  however  about his strategic ability  in particular as to whether he fully understood the importance of a sound administrative plan  Happiest while controlling a mobile force directly under his own eyes he was liable to overexploit immediate success without sufficient thought for the future  96  Sir David Hunt  one of Alexander s intelligence officers  expressed the view in his own book that     his real gift was for commanding an armoured regiment  perhaps a division  and that his absolute ceiling was an armoured corps  97  During the siege of Tobruk  Rommel launched frequent costly attacks during the first month of the siege  The level of losses incurred caused Rommel to have several arguments with his unit commanders  and also with the German High Command  Indeed  some sources indicate that Chief of Staff Halder had to send Friedrich Paulus to Africa to rein Rommel in  although Rommel himself maintained he had realized the futility of further attacks on the fortress on his own accord   edit  Popular perception Rommel was extraordinarily well known in his lifetime  not only by the German people  but also by his adversaries  Popular stories of his chivalry and tactical prowess earned him the respect of many opponents  including Claude Auchinleck  Winston Churchill  George S  Patton  and Bernard Montgomery  Rommel reciprocated their respect  for instance  he said Montgomery  never made a serious strategic mistake  and credited Patton with  the most astounding achievement in mobile warfare   98  Hitler counted Rommel among his favourite generals  Rommel was among the few Axis commanders  others being Isoroku Yamamoto and Reinhard Heydrich  directly targeted for assassination by Allied planners  However  unlike the other two  the attempt on Rommel s life was a failure  99  100  The Afrika Korps were never accused of any war crimes  and Rommel himself referred to the fighting in North Africa as Krieg ohne Hass war without hate  Numerous examples exist of Rommel s chivalry towards Allied POWs  such as his defiance of Hitler s infamous Commando Order following the capture of Lt  Roy Woodridge and Lt  George Lane as part of Operation Fortitude  He also refused to comply with Hitler s order to execute Jewish POWs  During Rommel s time in France  Hitler ordered him to deport the country s Jewish population  Rommel disobeyed  Several times he wrote letters protesting against the treatment of the Jews  When British Major Geoffrey Keyes was killed during a failed commando raid to kill or capture Rommel behind German lines  Rommel ordered him buried with full military honours  Also  during the construction of the Atlantic Wall  Rommel directed that French workers were not to be used as slaves  but were to be paid for their labour  101  His military colleagues also played their part in perpetuating his legend  His former subordinate Kircheim  though privately critical of Rommel s performance  nonetheless explained   thanks to propaganda  first by Goebbels  then by Montgomery  and finally  after he was poisoned  sic   by all former enemy powers  he has become a symbol of the best military traditions     Any public criticism of this legendary personality would damage the esteem in which the German soldier is held   nb 6  After the war  when Rommel s alleged involvement in the plot to kill Hitler became known  his stature was enhanced greatly among the former Allied nations  Rommel was often cited in Western sources as a general who  though a loyal German  was willing to stand up to Hitler  The release of the film The Desert Fox  The Story of Rommel  1951  helped to further enhance his reputation as one of the most widely known and well regarded leaders in the German Army  In 1970 a L tjens class destroyer was named the Rommel in his honour   edit  Quotations about Rommel The British Parliament considered a censure vote against Winston Churchill following the surrender at Tobruk  The vote failed  but in the course of the debate  Churchill stated  We have a very daring and skillful opponent against us  and  may I say across the havoc of war  a great general  102  Churchill again  He also deserves our respect  because  although a loyal German soldier  he came to hate Hitler and all his works  and took part in the conspiracy to rescue Germany by displacing the maniac and tyrant  For this  he paid the forfeit of his life  In the sombre wars of modern democracy  there is little place for chivalry  103  Theodor Werner was an officer who  during World War I  served under Rommel  Anybody who came under the spell of his personality turned into a real soldier  However tough the strain he seemed inexhaustible  He seemed to know what the enemy were like and how they would react  104  British General Claude Auchinleck  one of Rommel s opponents in Africa  in a letter to his field commanders  There exists a real danger that our friend Rommel is becoming a kind of magical or bogey man to our troops  who are talking far too much about him  He is by no means a superman  although he is undoubtedly very energetic and able  Even if he were a superman  it would still be highly undesirable that our men should credit him with supernatural powers     ending the memo with  I am not jealous of Rommel  105   edit  Medals and decorations W rttembergische
