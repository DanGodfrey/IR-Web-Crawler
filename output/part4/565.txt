History Robert S  McNamara  founder of DIA After World War II until the creation of DIA  the three Military Departments collected  produced and distributed their intelligence for individual use  This turned out to be duplicative  costly  and ineffective as each department provided their estimates to the Secretary of Defense or to other governmental agencies  The Defense Reorganization Act of 1958 wanted to correct these deficiencies by assigning responsibility for Unified and Specified Command intelligence support  However  the intelligence responsibilities remained unclear  the coordination was poor and the first results were short of national reliability and focus  As a result of this poor organization  President Dwight D  Eisenhower appointed the Joint Study Group in 1960 to find better ways for organizing the nation s military intelligence activities  Acting on the recommendations of the Joint Study Group  Secretary of Defense Robert S  McNamara advised the Joint Chiefs of Staff  JCS  of his decision to establish the Defense Intelligence Agency in February 1961  He ordered them to develop a concept plan that would integrate all the military intelligence of the DoD  During the spring and summer of 1961  as Cold War tensions flared over the Berlin Wall  Air Force Lieutenant General Joseph Carroll  soon to become DIA s first director  took the lead in planning and organizing this new agency  The JCS published DoD Directive 5105 21   Defense Intelligence Agency  on 1 August  and DIA began operations with a handful of employees in borrowed office space on 1 October 1961  DIA reported to the Secretary of Defense through the JCS  The new Agency s mission was the continuous task of collecting  processing  evaluating  analyzing  integrating  producing  and disseminating military intelligence for the DoD  Other objectives included more efficiently allocating scarce intelligence resources  more effectively managing all DoD intelligence activities  and eliminating redundancies in facilities  organizations  and tasks  Following DIA s establishment  the Services transferred intelligence functions and resources to it on a time phased basis to avoid rapidly degrading the overall effectiveness of defense intelligence  A year after its formation  in October 1962  the Agency faced its first major intelligence test during the superpower confrontation that developed after Soviet missiles were discovered at bases in Cuba by U S  Air Force spy planes  In late 1962  DIA established the Defense Intelligence School  now the National Intelligence University   and on 1 January 1963  it activated a new Production Center  Several Service elements were merged to form this production facility  which occupied the  A  and  B  Buildings at Arlington Hall Station  Virginia  The Agency also added an Automated Data Processing  ADP  Center on 19 February  a Dissemination Center on 31 March  and a Scientific and Technical Intelligence Directorate on 30 April 1963  DIA assumed the staff support functions of the J 2  Joint Staff  on 1 July 1963  Two years later  on 1 July 1965  DIA accepted responsibility for the Defense Attach  System   the last function the Services transferred to DIA  During these early years of DIA s existence  Agency attempts to establish itself as DoD s central military intelligence organization met with continuing Service opposition  At the same time  the Vietnam War severely tested the fledgling Agency s ability to produce accurate  timely intelligence  In particular  the war increased defense intelligence s involvement in efforts to account for American service members missing or captured in Southeast Asia  During the 1960s  DIA analysts focused on  China s detonation of an atomic bomb and the launching of its Cultural Revolution  increasing unrest among African nations  fighting in Cyprus and Kashmir  and the missile gap between the US and the Soviets  In the late 1960s  crises that tested intelligence responsiveness included  the Tet Offensive in Vietnam  the Six Day War between Egypt and Israel  continuing troubles in Africa  particularly Nigeria  North Korea s seizure of the USS Pueblo  and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia  The early 1970s were transitional years as the Agency shifted its focus from consolidating its functions and establishing itself as a credible producer of national intelligence  This proved difficult at first since sweeping manpower decrements between 1968 and 1975 had reduced Agency manpower by 31 percent and precipitated mission reductions and a broad organizational restructuring  Challenges facing DIA at this time included  the rise of Ostpolitik in Germany  the emergence of the Palestine Liberation Organization in the Mideast  and the U S  incursion into Cambodia from South Vietnam  The Agency s reputation grew considerably by the mid 1970s  as decision makers increasingly recognized the value of its products  Agency analysts in 1972 concentrated on Lebanon  President Richard Nixon s visit to China  the formation of Sri Lanka  Salvador Allende s regime in Chile  and the prisoners of war being held in Southeast Asia  Subsequent challenges involved  d tente  the development of arms control agreements  the Paris peace talks  Vietnam   the Yom Kippur War  and global energy concerns  Intense Congressional review during 1975 76 created turbulence within the national Intelligence Community  The Murphy and Rockefeller Commission investigations of charges of intelligence abuse ultimately led to an Executive Order that modified many Intelligence Community functions  At the same time  with American involvement in Vietnam ending  defense intelligence faced a significant decline in resources  During this period  DIA conducted numerous studies on ways of improving its intelligence products  Ultimately  the Agency strengthened its support to the Office of the Secretary of Defense  OSD   the Joint Chiefs of Staff  JCS   and the Unified  amp  Specified Commands  and also modernized the National Military Intelligence Center  NMIC   Faced with similar resource challenges  DoD also sought to centralize its activities  Despite these and other Community wide efforts to improve intelligence support  the loss of resources during the 1970s limited the Community s ability to collect and produce timely intelligence and ultimately contributed to intelligence shortcomings in Iran  Afghanistan  and other strategic areas  As resources declined  intelligence requirements expanded  By the late 1970s  Agency analysts were focused on Lebanon  China  South Africa  terrorism  and Southeast Asia POW issues  In 1977  a charter revision further clarified DIA s relationship with the JCS and the Secretary of Defense  Specifically  the Secretary assigned staff supervisory responsibility over DIA in the resource area to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command  Control  Communications  and Intelligence  while giving the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs supervisory responsibility regarding policy matters  Analytical efforts within the Agency at the time centered on the death of Mao Tse Tung  aircraft hijacking  the Israeli raid on Entebbe Airport  unrest in South Africa  and continuing Middle East tensions  Special DIA task forces were set up to monitor crises such as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan  the overthrow of Iranian monarchy  and the taking of U S  hostages in the American embassy in Teheran in 1979  Also  of serious concern were the Vietnamese takeover in Phnom Penh  the China Vietnam border war  the overthrow of Idi Amin in Uganda  the North South Yemen dispute  troubles in Pakistan  border clashes between Libya and Egypt  the Sandinista takeover in Nicaragua  and the Soviet movement of combat troops to Cuba during the signing of the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty II  Following the promulgation in 1979 of Executive Order 12036  which restructured the Intelligence Community and better outlined DIA s national and departmental responsibilities  the Agency was reorganized around five major directorates  production  operations  resources  external affairs  and J 2 support  DIA came of age in the 1980s by focusing heavily on the intelligence needs of both field commanders and national level decision makers  DIA s publication in 1981 of the first in a series of whitepapers on the strengths and capabilities of Soviet military forces titled Soviet Military Power met with wide acclaim  Ten such booklets were published subsequently over roughly the next decade  World crises continued to flare and included the downing of two Libyan Su 22s by American F 14s over the Gulf of Sidra  an Israeli F 16 raid to destroy an Iraqi nuclear reactor  two Iranian hijackings  Iranian air raids on Kuwait  and the release of American hostages in Iran  Other analysis at this time was focused on the war over the Falkland Islands  Israel s invasion of Lebanon  and Operation URGENT FURY in Grenada  Other DIA analytical efforts during the mid 1980s centered on the attack on the Marine barracks in Lebanon  the Iran Iraq War  the conflict in Afghanistan  the Soviet downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007  the civil war in Chad  and unrest in the Philippines  Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger presented DIA with the Agency s first Joint Meritorious Unit Award in 1986 for outstanding intelligence support over the previous year during a series of crises the hijacking of TWA Flight 847 and the cruise ship Achille Lauro  unrest in the Philippines  and counter terrorist operations against Libya  Also at this time  the Agency concentrated on the rapidly shifting national security environment  characterized by key issues such as changes within the Soviet Union  counter narcotics  war fighting capabilities and sustainability  and low intensity conflict  DoD moved decisively to improve its automated data bases and apply additional resources to the monitoring of terrorist groups  illegal arms shipments  and narcotics trafficking  Arms control monitoring also increased the demand for intelligence support from DIA  In 1983  in order to research the flow of technology to the Soviet Union  the Reagan Administration created Project Socrates within the Defense Intelligence Agency  Over the following years Project Socrates s scope broadened to include monitoring of foreign advanced technology as a whole  Project Socrates ended in 1990 with Michael Sekora  the project s director  leaving in protest when the Bush Administration reduced funding  Designated a combat support agency under the Goldwater Nicholas Defense Reorganization Act  DIA moved quickly to increase cooperation with the Unified  amp  Specified Commands and to begin developing a body of joint intelligence doctrine  Intelligence support to U S  allies in the Middle East intensified as the Iran Iraq War spilled into the Persian Gulf  DIA provided significant intelligence support to Operation Earnest Will while closely monitoring incidents such as the Iraqi rocket attack on the USS Stark  the destruction of Iranian oil platforms  and Iranian attacks on Kuwaiti oil tankers  The  Toyota War  between Libya and Chad and the turmoil in Haiti added to DIA s heavy production workload  as did unrest in other parts of Latin America  Somalia  Ethiopia  Burma  Pakistan  and the Philippines  Subsequently  the Agency provided threat data on  hot spots  throughout the Middle East  Africa  and Asia  while assessing the impact of changes in the USSR  Eastern Europe  and  to a lesser degree  Asia  In addition  DIA supported decision makers with intelligence concerning the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan  events surrounding the downing of several Libyan jets  the civil war in Liberia  and the investigation of the downing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie  Scotland  Weapons acquisition issues  counter narcotics  and counter terrorism  likewise  remained high priority issues  With the end of the Cold War  defense intelligence began a period of reevaluation following the fall of Communism in many of the East European countries  the reunification of Germany  and ongoing economic reforms in the region  During this phase  DIA emphasized improved management of intelligence production  DoD wide  as resource reductions once again threatened to negatively impact Agency objectives and manpower  Organizationally  DIA adopted the concept of functional management to better address unified  amp  specified command intelligence issues  In response to Iraq s invasion of Kuwait in August 1990  DIA set up an extensive  24 hour  crisis management cell designed to tailor national level intelligence support to the coalition forces assembled to expel Iraq from Kuwait  By the time Operation Desert Storm began  some 2 000 Agency personnel were involved in the intelligence support effort  Most of them associated in some way with the national level Joint Intelligence Center  JIC   which DIA established in The Pentagon to integrate the intelligence being produced throughout the Community  DIA sent more than 100 employees into the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations to provide intelligence support  This DIA led effort remains one of the greatest examples of intelligence support to operational forces in modern times  The Armed Forces Medical Intelligence Center  AFMIC   and the Missile and Space Intelligence Center  MSIC   associated with the Army for over 20 and 50 years respectively  became part of DIA in January 1992  This was part of the continuing effort to consolidate intelligence production and make it more efficient  Since the September 11  2001 terrorist attacks  DIA has been active in nuclear proliferation intelligence collection and analysis with particular interests in North Korea and Iran as well as counter terrorism  DIA was also involved with the intelligence build up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and was a subject in the Senate Report of Pre war Intelligence on Iraq  The Defense Intelligence Agency has conflicted with the Central Intelligence Agency  CIA  in collection and analysis on the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and has often represented the Pentagon in the CIA DoD intelligence rivalry due to DIA s alleged clandestine HUMINT collection and often overlapping analysis products  Operational military intelligence has also been a focus  particularly in Iraq with insurgency threats and asymmetric warfare  The DIA is responsible for assessing the current and projected national security threats to the United States as well as presenting these assessments to the Senate Armed Services Committee  The DIA still actively maintains its responsibility for conventional strategic and operational military intelligence   edit  Organization DIA is led by a Director  typically a three star military officer  The current director is Lieutenant General Ronald Burgess  USA  who assumed command in March 2009  David Shedd was appointed deputy director in September 2010  and Sharon Houy has served as chief of staff since June 2010  Lieutenant General Ronald Burgess  USA  17th Director of DIA DIA is organized into these primary operational directorates and centers  Defense
