Joint venture From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search For other uses  see Joint Venture  disambiguation   This article is written like a personal reflection or essay rather than an encyclopedic description of the subject  Please help improve it by rewriting it in an encyclopedic style   April 2010  This article needs additional citations for verification  Please help

develop  for a finite time  a new entity and new assets by contributing equity  They exercise control over the enterprise and consequently share revenues  expenses and assets  There are other types of companies such as JV limited by guarantee  joint ventures limited by guarantee with partners holding shares  In European law  the term  joint venture   or joint undertaking  is an elusive legal concept  better defined under the rules of company law  In France  the term  joint venture  is variously translated as  association d entreprises    entreprise conjointe    coentreprise  or  entreprise commune   But generally  the term societe anonyme loosely covers all foreign collaborations  In Germany   joint venture  is better represented as a  combination of companies   Konzern   1  With individuals  when two or more persons come together to form a temporary partnership for the purpose of carrying out a particular project  such partnership can also be called a joint venture where the parties are  co venturers   The venture can be for one specific project only   when the JV is referred to more correctly as a consortium  as the building of the Channel Tunnel    or a continuing business relationship  The consortium JV  also known as a cooperative agreement  is formed where one party seeks technological expertise or technical service arrangements  franchise and brand use agreements  management contracts  rental agreements  for one time contracts  The JV is dissolved when that goal is reached  Some major joint ventures include Dow Corning  MillerCoors  Sony Ericsson  Penske Truck Leasing  Norampac  and Owens Corning  A joint venture takes place when two parties come together to take on one project  In a joint venture  both parties are equally invested in the project in terms of money  time  and effort to build on the original concept  While joint ventures are generally small projects  major corporations also use this method in order to diversify  A joint venture can ensure the success of smaller projects for those that are just starting in the business world or for established corporations  Since the cost of starting new projects is generally high  a joint venture allows both parties to share the burden of the project  as well as the resulting profits  Since money is involved in a joint venture  it is necessary to have a strategic plan in place  In short  both parties must be committed to focusing on the future of the partnership  rather than just the immediate returns  Ultimately  short term and long term successes are both important  In order to achieve this success  honesty  integrity  and communication within the joint venture are necessary  Contents 1 Finding ideas or partners 2 Preparation 3 Partner selection 4 Feasibility study

Finding ideas or partners In the era of the Internet  finding opportunities for exploiting an idea is sizeable together with remote  or advertised  communicating  There are also the blogging networks as well the social networking sites and search engines  There are also other venues to find a JV partner such as seminars  exhibitions  directories and the plain newspaper advertising of opportunities  One should not forget websites which have become prosperous like eBay and Amazon com  Wikipedia  YouTube to name the most obvious  Forming JVs with distributor and marketing agencies is possible in this flat world to market a product  But finding an entrepreneur for a JV is another task  Nonetheless  there are risk takers  venture capitalists  angel investors and venture managers  see  Carried interest    especially in the high tech industries like IC chips or biotechnology  Although they typically exit once an idea or an opportunity proves itself  there are watchful funds and investors who could go in for a JV  Joint ventures have also become more prominent in the world of alternative investments since the financial crisis began in 2007  In an Opalesque TV 2  video  Tim Krochuk of hedge fund GRT Capital Partners describes how hedge funds have begun teaming up with traditional long only asset managers in joint ventures to provide alternative capabilities to existing traditional asset management firms  The emergence of these joint ventures continues the trend of alternative investments becoming a larger piece of traditional portfolios   edit  Preparation Formulating the JV is a series of steps  one which needs a lot of work and yet  at the same time  precision  One can here only underline the steps or information that will be needed by the JV candidate  They are   3  the objectives  structure and projected form of the joint venture  including the amount of investment and financing arrangements and debt the JV s products  their technical description and usage alternate production technologies estimated cost of equipment estimated product price s  costing market analysis for the product  inside and outside the  territory  analysis of competition projected sales and methods of distribution details of offered site  including output projections  transport and warehousing  testing and quality control  by products and waste   supply  utility  and transport requirements  estimated technology transfer costs foreign exchange projections  where applicable  staff requirements and training financial projections environmental impact social benefit  edit  Partner selection While the following offers some insight to the process of joining up with a committed partner to form a JV  it is often difficult to determine whether the commitments come from a known and distinguishable party or an intermediary  This is particularly so when the language barrier exists and one is unfamiliar with local customs  especially in approaches to government  often the deciding body for the formation of a JV or dispute settlement  The ideal process of selecting a JV partner emerges from  screening of prospective partners short listing a set of prospective partners and some sort of ranking due diligence   checking the credentials of the other party availability of appreciated or depreciated property contributed to the joint venture the most appropriate structure and invitation bid foreign investor buying an interest in a local company Companies are also called JVs in cases where there are dominant partners together with participation of the public  There may also be cases where the public shareholding is substantial but the founding partners retain their identity  These companies may be  public  or  private  companies  It would be out of place to describe them  except to say there are many in India  Further consideration relates to starting a new legal entity ground up  Such an enterprise is sometimes called  an incorporated JV   one  packaged  with technology contracts  knowhow  patents  trademarks and copyright   technical services and assisted supply arrangements  The consortium JV  also known as a cooperative agreement  is formed where one party seeks technological expertise or technical service arrangements  franchise and brand use agreements  management contracts  rental agreements  for  one time  contracts  e g   for construction projects  They dissolve the JV when that goal is reached   edit  Feasibility study A nascent JV project outlines  the partners the objectives and structure of the JV investment and financing arrangements product s  and description and usage  output production technology equipment required and costs technology transfer costs cost benefit analysis market analysis analysis of competition details of the site transport and warehousing by products and waste supply  utility  and transport requirements foreign exchange projections staff requirements and training Its feasibility  besides its profitability  is assessed  in terms of government control over the JV  by considering it  along with the Articles which will regulate it  by its strength or weakness factors  for the economy or the country  in aspects such as  the quality of the technology   its appropriateness to the national infrastructure  exports  etc  value to national economy and other contributions  i e   labor intensity  environment factors  utility usage   greeness  of the technology   waste treatment and disposal capability of recipient to absorb the technology cost of the technology and competitiveness supporting strengths  trademarks  patents  know how  copyrights in case of IT  limits imposed  by its supplier  on the use or non use of the technology   edit  Company incorporation A JV can be brought about in the following major ways  Foreign investor buying an interest in a local company Local firm acquiring an interest in an existing foreign firm Both the foreign and local entrepreneurs jointly forming a new enterprise Together with public capital and or bank debt In the U K and India   and in many Common Law countries   a joint venture  or else a company formed by a group of individuals  must file with the appropriate authority the Memorandum of Association  It is a statutory document which informs the outside public of its existence  It may be viewed by the public at the office in which it is filed  A sample can be seen at wikimedia org  4  Together with the Articles of Association  it forms the  constitution  of a company in these countries  The Articles of Association regulate the interaction between shareholders and the directors of a company and can be a lengthy document of up to 700 000  pages  It deals with the powers relegated by the stockholders to the Directors and those withheld by them  requiring the passing of ordinary resolutions  special resolutions and the holding of Extraordinary General Meetings to bring the Directors  decision to bear  A Certificate of Incorporation 5  or the Articles of Incorporation 6  is a document required to form a corporation in the US  in actuality  the State where it is incorporated  and in countries following the practice  In the US  the  constitution  is a single document  The Articles of Incorporation is again a regulation of the Directors by the stock holders in a company  By its formation the JV becomes a new entity with the implication  that it is officially separate from its Founders  who might otherwise be giant corporations  even amongst the emerging countries the JV can contract in its own name  acquire rights  such as the right to buy new companies   and it has a separate liability from that of its founders  except for invested capital it can sue  and be sued  in courts in defense or its pursuance of its objectives  On the receipt of the Certificate of Incorporation a company can commence its business   edit  Shareholders  agreement This is a legal area and is fraught with difficulty as the laws of countries differ  particularly on the enforceability of  heads of  or shareholder agreements  For some legal reasons it may be called a Memorandum of Understanding  It is done in parallel with other activities in forming a JV  Though dealt with briefly for a shareholders  agreement  7   some issues must be dealt with here as a preamble to the discussion that follows  There are also many issues which are not in the Articles when a company starts up or never ever present  Also  a JV may elect to stay as a JV alone in a  quasi partnership  to avoid any nonessential disclosure to the government or the public  Some of the issues in a shareholders  agreement are  Valuation of intellectual rights  say  the valuations of the IPR of one partner and say  the real estate of the other the control of the Company either by the number of Directors or its  funding  The number of directors and the rights of the founders to their appoint Directors which shows as to whether a shareholder dominates or shares equality  management decisions   whether the board manages or a founder transferability of shares   assignment rights of the founders to other members of the company dividend policy   percentage of profits to be declared when there is profit winding up   the conditions  notice to members confidentiality of know how and founders  agreement and penalties for disclosure first right of refusal   purchase rights and counter bid by a founder  There are many features which have to be incorporated into the Shareholders Agreement which is quite private to the parties as they start off  Normally  it requires no submission to any authority  The other basic document which must be articulated is the Articles which is a published document and known to members  This repeats the Shareholders Agreement as to the number of Directors each founder can appoint to the  see Board of Directors   Whether the Board controls or the Founders  The taking of decisions by simple majority  50  1  of those present or a 51  or 75  majority with all Directors present  their alternates proxy   the deployment of funds of the firm  extent of debt  the proportion of profit that can be declared as dividends  etc  Also significant is what will happen if the firm is dissolved  one of the partner dies  Also  the  first right  of refusal if the firm is sold  sometimes its puts and calls  Often the most successful JVs are those with 50 50 partnership with each party having the same number of Directors but rotating control over the firm  or rights to appoint the Chairperson and Vice chair of the Company  Sometimes a party may give a separate trusted person to vote in its place proxy vote of the Founder at Board Meetings  8  Recently  in a major case the Indian Supreme Court has held that Memorandums of Understanding  whose details are not in the Articles of Association  are  unconstitutional  giving more transparency to undertakings   edit  Chinese Law It is interesting to study the joint venture laws of China because they are of recent vintage and because such a unique law exists  According to a report of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 2003  China was the recipient of US 53 5 billion in direct foreign investment  making it the world s largest recipient of direct foreign investment for the first time  to exceed the USA  Also  it approved the establishment of nearly 500 000 foreign investment enterprises  9  The US had 45 000 projects  by 2004  with an in place investment of over 48 billion  10  Until 1949  no guidelines existed on how foreign investment was to be handled due to the restrictive nature of China toward foreign investors  Since Mao Zedong initiatives in foreign trade began to be applied  and law applicable to foreign direct investment was made clear in 1979  the first Sino foreign equity venture took place in 2001  11  The corpus of the law has improved since then  Companies with foreign partners can carry out manufacturing and sales operations in China and can sell through their own sales network  Foreign Sino companies have export rights which are not available to wholly Chinese companies  as China desires to import foreign technology by encouraging JVs and the latest technologies  Under Chinese law  foreign enterprises are divided into several basic categories  Of these  five will be described or mentioned here  three relate to industry and services and two as vehicles for foreign investment  Those 5 categories of Chinese foreign enterprises are  the Sino Foreign Equity Joint Ventures  EJVs   Sino Foreign Co operative Joint Ventures  CJVs   Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprises  WFOE   although they do not strictly belong to Joint Ventures  plus foreign investment companies limited by shares  FICLBS   and Investment Companies through Foreign Investors  ICFI   Each category is described below   edit  Equity joint ventures The EJV Law is between a Chinese partner and a foreign company  It is incorporated in both Chinese  official  and in English  with equal validity   with limited liability  Prior to China s entry into WTO   and thus the WFOEs   EJVs predominated  In the EJV mode  the partners share profits  losses and risk in equal proportion to their respective contributions to the venture s registered capital  These escalate upwardly in the same proportion as the increase in registered capital  The JV contract accompanied by the Articles of Association for the EJV are the two most fundamental legal documents of the project  The Articles mirror many of the provisions of the JV contract  In case of conflict the JV document has precedence These documents are prepared at the same time as the feasibility report  There are also the ancillary documents  termed  offsets  in the US  covering know how and trademarks and supply of equipment agreements  The minimum equity is prescribed for investment  truncated   3  12  where the foreign equity and debt levels are  13  less than US 3 million  equity must constitute 70  of the investment  between US 3 million and US 10 million  minimum equity must be US 2 1 million and at least 50  of the investment  between US 10 million and US 30 million  minimum equity must be US 5 million and at least 40  of the investment  more than US 30 million  minimum equity must be US 12 million and at least 1 3 of the investment  There are also intermediary levels  The foreign investment in the total project must be at least 25   No minimum investment is set for the Chinese partner  The timing of investments must be mentioned in the Agreement and failure to invest in the indicated time  draws a penalty   edit  Cooperative joint ventures Co operative Joint Ventures  CJVs  14  are permitted under the Sino Foreign Co operative Joint Ventures  Co operative enterprises are also called Contractual Operative Enterprises  The CJVs may have a limited structure or unlimited   therefore  there are two versions  The limited liability version is similar to the EJVs in status of permissions   the foreign investor provides the majority of funds and technology and the Chinese party provides land  buildings  equipment  etc  However  there are no minimum limits on the foreign partner which allows him to be a minority shareholder  The other format of the CJV is similar to a partnership where the parties jointly incur unlimited liability for the debts of the enterprise with no separate legal person being created  In both the cases  the status of the formed enterprise is that of a legal Chinese person which can hire labor directly as  for example  a Chinese national contactor  The minimum of the capital is registered at various levels of investment  Other differences from the EJV are to be noted  A Co operative JV does not have to be a legal entity  The partners in a CJV are allowed to share profit on an agreed basis  not necessarily in proportion to capital contribution  This proportion also determines the control and the risks of the enterprise in the same proportion  It may be possible to operate in a CJV in a restricted area A CJV could allow negotiated levels of management and financial control  as well as methods of recourse associated with equipment leases and service contracts  In an EJV management control is through allocation of Board seats  15  During the term of the venture  the foreign participant can recover his investment  provided the contract prescribes that and all fixed assets will become the property of the Chinese participant on termination of the JV  Foreign partners can often obtain the desired level of control by negotiating management  voting  and staffing rights into a CJV s articles  since control does not have to be allocated according to equity stakes  Convenience and flexibility are the characteristics of this type of investment  It is therefore easier to find co operative partners and to reach an agreement  With changes in the law  it becomes possible to merge with a Chinese company for a quick start  A foreign investor does not need to set up a new corporation in China  Instead  the investor uses the Chinese partner s business license  under a contractual arrangement  Under the CJV  however  the land stays in the possession of the Chinese partner  There is another advantage  the percentage of the CJV owned by each partner can change throughout the JV s life  giving the option to the foreign investor  by holding higher equity  obtains a faster rate of return with the concurrent wish of the Chinese partner of a later larger role of maintaining long term control  The parties in any of the ventures  EJV  CJV or WFOE prepare a feasibility study outlined above  It is a non binding document   the parties are still free to choose not to proceed with the project  The feasibility study must cover the fundamental technical and commercial aspects of the project  before the parties can proceed to formalize the necessary legal documentation  The study should contain details referred to earlier under Feasibility Study 9   submissions by the Chinese partner    edit  Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprises  WFOEs  There is basic law of the PRC concerning enterprises with sole foreign investment controls  WFOEs  China s entry into the World Trade Organization  WTO  around 2001 has had profound effects on foreign investment  Not being a JV  they are considered here only in comparison or contrast  To implement WTO commitments  China publishes from time to time updated versions of its  Catalogs Investments   affecting ventures  prohibited  restricted  The WFOE is a Chinese legal person and has to obey all Chinese laws  As such  it is allowed to enter into contracts with appropriate government authorities to acquire land use rights  rent buildings  and receive utility services  In this it is more similar to a CJV than an EJV  WFOEs are expected by PRC to use the most modern technologies and to export at least 50  of their production  with all of the investment is to be wholly provided by the foreign investor and the enterprise is within his total control  WFOEs are typically limited liability enterprises  like with EJVs  but the liability of the Directors  Managers  Advisers  and Suppliers depends on the rules which govern the Departments or Ministries which control product liability  worker safety or environmental protection  An advantage the WFOE enjoys over its alternates is the protection to its know how but a principal disadvantage is absence of an interested and influential Chinese party  As of the 3rd Quarter 2004 the WFOEs had replaced EJVs and CJVs as follows  15  Distribution Analysis of JV in Industry   PRC Type JV 2000 2001 2002

Joint ventures in India  edit  Introduction India has an open philosophy on capital markets  and it closely parallels its English peers in operation  The Bombay Stock Exchange  BSE  has close to 5 000 listed shares  and trades in several thousand more  making it the largest stock exchange in the world  16  The National Stock Exchange is the other exchange at present  English is one of the preferred languages of the market  and its policies are first announced in English  The Indian people are skilled and entrepreneurial by nature as evident in world markets  but in India  less than 1  of its billion population at present   that is  only 11 million people   representing 3  of households invest in the market  17  People who work the market in other languages are adept in recognizing concepts in derivatives and futures and trade in them  India is one of three countries that has supercomputers  one of six that has satellite launching facilities and has over 100 Fortune 500 companies doing R amp D in the country  18  India does not restrict the repatriation of investments  dividends  profits and if need be  the principal  through the single autonomous entity  the Reserve Bank of India  RBI   The Indian currency  the rupee  is 100  convertible for earnings at free market rates  India s new policies  described below  have resulted in aggregate foreign investment flowing into India  increasing from US 103 million in 1990 91 to US 61 8 billion in 2007 2008  19  20   edit  Liberalization of policy India s basic outlines of industrial development were framed by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in 1956  making the private sector a participant in development  but giving the public sector a dominant position  21  However  by the early 1990s  the situation in the world economies turned  Japan entered a phase of stagnancy of growth  the pace of the  Asian tigers  slowed  as did the European economy  But  also  the country s balance of payments crisis  To counteract these effects a new policy was born in July 1991  the reformed New Industrial Policy  NIP   22  It and later modifications  further liberalization  streamlines procedures  deregulated industrial licensing  and vastly expanded the role for the private sector  while shrinking the Public Sector  Also  anti trust laws  the Monopoly and Restrictive Practices Act  were trimmed and customs duties for industrial goods slashed  The restrictive Foreign Exchange Regulation Act  FERA  was replaced by the Foreign Exchange Management Act  FEMA   Industrial policy divided industry into three categories  those that would be reserved for public sector development  those under private enterprise with or without State participation  and those in which investment initiatives would ordinarily emanate from private entrepreneurs  Only six industries are exclusively reserved for the public sector  trading  except single brand retailing   agricultural or plantation activities  housing and real estate business  except development of townships   atomic energy  gambling or betting lottery business  and retail construction of residential commercial premises  roads or bridges are on the negative list for foreign participation   edit  Automatic licensing and administered licensing India s investment policy  as of April 2010  is presented at the site  23  Briefly  India allows investments both through Foreign Direct Investment  FDI   meant for long term controlling investments and Portfolio Investment   taking a position by buying shares of a company   which is likely short term capital market operation  Foreign Institutional Investors  FIIs  from reputable institutions  like pension funds  mutual funds  may  and do  participate in the Indian capital markets  Industrial approvals are automatic  RBI approval of investment  for most manufacturing industries with equity investment up to 51  foreign control and as of 1997 to 74  in certain select industries  See the current policy highlighted above   For another 36 sectors there are varying limits without output restrictions  RBI approvals come within two weeks for the invested entity  Investments can flow to the country prior to approvals for such cases  Even in sectors limited to 51   a higher level of control  up to 74   is feasible if approach is made to the Foreign Investment Promotiomn Board  FIPB    thus

ventures  Companies which are incorporated in India are treated on par as domestic companies  The above two parties subscribe to the shares of the JV company in agreed proportion  in cash  and start a new business  Two parties   individuals or companies   incorporate a company in India  Business of one party is transferred to the company and as consideration for such transfer  shares are issued by the company and subscribed by that party  The other party subscribes for the shares in cash  Promoter shareholder of an existing Indian company and a third party  who which may be individual company  one of them non resident or both residents  collaborate to jointly carry on the business of that company and its shares are taken by the said third party through payment in cash  Private companies  only about  2500 is the lower limit of capital  no upper limit  are allowed 24  in India together with and public companies  limited or not  likewise with partnerships  sole proprietorship too are allowed  However  the latter are reserved for NRIs  Through capital market operations foreign companies can transact on the two exchanges without prior permission of RBI but they cannot own more than 10 percent equity in paid up capital of Indian enterprises  while aggregate foreign institutional investment  FII  in an enterprise is capped at 24 percent  The establishment of wholly owned subsidiaries  WOS  and project offices and branch offices  incorporated in India or not  Sometimes  it is understood  that branches are started to test the market and get its flavor  Equity transfer from residents to non residents in mergers and acquisitions  M amp A  is usually permitted under the automatic route  However  if the M amp As are in sectors and activities requiring prior government permission  Appendix 1 of the Policy  then transfer can proceed only after permission  20  Joint ventures with trading companies are allowed together with imports of secondhand plants and machinery  It is expected that in a JV  the foreign partner supplies technical collaboration and the pricing includes the foreign exchange component  while the Indian partner makes available the factory or building site and locally made machinery and product parts  Many JVs are formed as public limited companies  LLCs  because of the advantages of limited liability  25  JVs are expected in the nuclear industry following the NSG waivers for nuclear trade  The nuclear power industry has been witnessing several JVs  The country has set an imposing target of achieving an installed capacity of 20 GW by 2020 and 63 GW by 2030  The total size of the Indian nuclear power market will be around  40 billion by 2020 with a growth rate  AAGR  of 9 2  in installed nuclear capacity during 2008 20  The total investments made are to a tune of around  1 30 billion following the Indo US nuclear deal in 2008  26  There is a group of industries reserved for the small scale sector wherein foreign investment cannot exceed 24   and if does  then approval is necessary from the FIPB  and the unit loses its  smallness  and requires an industrial license  27  There are many JVs  lying outside of this discussion   Hindusthan Unilever Unilever  Suziki Govt  of India  Maruti Motors   Bharti Airteli Singapore Telecom  ITC Imperial Tobacco  P amp G Home Products  Whirlpool  having financial participation with the financial institutions and the lay public which are monitored by SEBI  Securities and Exchange Board of India   also an autonomous body  This lies outside this discussion  Under the country s laws  a public company must  Have at least seven shareholders Have at least three directors Obtain government approval for the appointment of its management  Have both a  trading certificate  and certificate of incorporation before commencing its business  Publish also a prospectus  or file a statement  before it can start transact business  Hold statutory meetings There are several other provisions contained in the Companies Act 1956 which also need to be followed   edit  Royalty payments and capitalization For the automatic route  RBI allows  28  Lump sum payments not exceeding US 2 million  Royalty payable is limited to 5  for domestic sales and 8  for exports  without any restriction on the duration of the royalty payments  The royalty limits are net of taxes and are calculated according to standard conditions  Payments are made through RBI  The royalty is calculated on the basis of the net ex factory sale price of the product  exclusive of excise duties  minus the cost of the standard bought out components and the landed cost of imported components  irrespective of the source of procurement  including ocean freight  insurance  custom duties  etc  Issue of equity shares against lump sum fees and royalty fees is permitted  For exceeding this norm  the firm has to approach FPBI   edit  India s legal system India is a common law country with a written constitution  guaranteeing individual and property rights  There is a single hierarchy of courts  Arbitration can be in India or International Commercial Arbitration  The country has recently enacted the Arbitration and Conciliation Act  1996   New Law    The New Law is based on the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law  UNCITRAL  Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration  Model Law   24  All agreements are under Indian laws   edit  Articles of Association Introduction The Articles of Association determine how a company is run  It is a set of  by laws  which form the  constitution  of the Company  It is often required by Law to be part of the Joint  Venture agreement  Some clauses relating to the following may be absent  Where this the case  it is assumed that the provisions as laid out in the in Company Law apply  The Articles can cover a medley of topics  mot all of which is required in a country s law  Although all will not be discussed  it can cover  Valuation of intellectual rights  say  the valuations of the IPR of one partner and say the real estate of the other The appointments of directors   which shows whether a shareholder dominates or shares equality  directors meetings   the quorum and percentage of vote management decisions   whether the board manages or a founder transferability of shares   assignment rights of the founders or other members of the company special voting rights of a Chairman and mode of election dividend policy   percentage of profits to be declared when there is profit winding up   the conditions  notice to members confidentiality of know how and founders  agreement and penalties for disclosure first right of refusal   purchase rights and counter bid by a founder  Some agreements mention that the Articles of Association as given in Company Law apply to the agreement except where specifically differing  and others say  explicitly  that they do not bind that the agreement and
