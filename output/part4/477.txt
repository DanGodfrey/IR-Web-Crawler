for  grey  or  shining   and atomic number 47  A soft  white  lustrous transition metal  it has the highest electrical conductivity of any element and the highest thermal conductivity of any metal  The metal occurs naturally in its pure  free form  native silver   as an alloy with gold and other metals  and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite  Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper  gold  lead  and zinc refining  Silver has long been valued as a precious metal  and it is used to make ornaments  jewelry  high value tableware  utensils  hence the term silverware   and currency coins  Today  silver metal is also used in electrical contacts and conductors  in mirrors and in catalysis of chemical reactions  Its compounds are used in photographic film  and dilute silver nitrate solutions and other silver compounds are used as disinfectants and microbiocides  While many medical antimicrobial uses of silver have been supplanted by antibiotics  further research into clinical potential continues  Contents 1 Characteristics 2 Isotopes 3 Compounds 4 Applications 4 1 Currency 4 2 Jewelry and silverware 4 3 Dentistry 4 4 Photography and electronics 4 5 Mirrors

monovalent coinage metal  with a brilliant white metallic luster that can take a high degree of polish  It has the highest electrical conductivity of all metals  even higher than copper  but its greater cost has prevented it from being widely used in place of copper for electrical purposes  Despite this  13 540 tons were used in the electromagnets used for enriching uranium during World War II  mainly because of the wartime shortage of copper   2  3  4  An exception to this is in radio frequency engineering  particularly at VHF and higher frequencies  where silver plating to improve electrical conductivity of parts  including wires  is widely employed  Another notable exception is in high end audio cables  where manufacturers claim that scaling copper conductors by 6  achieves slightly better results  citation needed  Among metals  pure silver has the highest thermal conductivity  the nonmetal diamond and superfluid helium II are higher  and one of the highest optical reflectivities  5   Aluminium slightly outdoes silver in parts of the visible spectrum  and silver is a poor reflector of ultraviolet light   Silver also has the lowest contact resistance of any metal  Silver halides are photosensitive and are remarkable for their ability to record a latent image that can later be developed chemically  Silver is stable in pure air and water  but tarnishes when it is exposed to air or water containing ozone or hydrogen sulfide  the latter forming a black layer of silver sulfide which can be cleaned off with dilute hydrochloric acid  6  The most common oxidation state of silver is  1  for example  silver nitrate  AgNO3   in addition   2 compounds  for example  silver II  fluoride  AgF2  and the less common  3 compounds  for example  potassium tetrafluoroargentate  K AgF4    are known   edit  Isotopes Main article  Isotopes of silver Naturally occurring silver is composed of two stable isotopes  107Ag and 109Ag  with 107Ag being the most abundant  51 839  natural abundance   Silver s isotopes are almost equal in abundance  something which is rare in the periodic table  Silver s atomic weight is 107 8682 2  g mol  7  8  Twenty eight radioisotopes have been characterized  the most stable being 105Ag with a half life of 41 29 days  111Ag with a half life of 7 45 days  and 112Ag with a half life of 3 13 hours  This element has numerous meta states  the most stable being 108mAg  t1 2   418 years   110mAg  t1 2   249 79 days  and 106mAg  t1 2   8 28 days   All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives that are less than an hour  and the majority of these have half lives that are less than three minutes  Isotopes of silver range in relative atomic mass from 93 943  94Ag  to 126 936  127Ag   9  the primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope  107Ag  is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta decay  The primary decay products before 107Ag are palladium  element 46  isotopes  and the primary products after are cadmium  element 48  isotopes  The palladium isotope 107Pd decays by beta emission to 107Ag with a half life of 6 5 million years  Iron meteorites are the only objects with a high enough palladium to silver ratio to yield measurable variations in 107Ag abundance  Radiogenic 107Ag was first discovered in the Santa Clara meteorite in 1978  10  The discoverers suggest the coalescence and differentiation of iron cored small planets may have occurred 10 million years after a nucleosynthetic event  107Pd 107Ag correlations observed in bodies that have clearly been melted since the accretion of the solar system must reflect the presence of unstable nuclides in the early solar system  11   edit  Compounds Silver metal dissolves readily in nitric acid  HNO3  to produce silver nitrate  AgNO3   a transparent crystalline solid that is photosensitive and readily soluble in water  Silver nitrate is used as the starting point for the synthesis of many other silver compounds  as an antiseptic  and as a yellow stain for glass in stained glass  Silver metal does not react with sulfuric acid  which is used in jewelry making to clean and remove copper oxide firescale from silver articles after silver soldering or annealing  However  silver reacts readily with sulfur or hydrogen sulfide H2S to produce silver sulfide  a dark colored compound familiar as the tarnish on silver coins and other objects  Silver sulfide also forms silver whiskers when silver electrical contacts are used in an atmosphere rich in hydrogen sulfide  4 Ag   O2   2 H2S   2 Ag2S   2 H2O Cessna 210 equipped with a silver iodide generator for cloud seeding Silver chloride  AgCl  is precipitated from solutions of silver nitrate in the presence of chloride ions  and the other silver halides used in the manufacture of photographic emulsions are made in the same way  using bromide or iodide salts  Silver chloride is used in glass electrodes for pH testing and potentiometric measurement  and as a transparent cement for glass  Silver iodide has been used in attempts to seed clouds to produce rain  6  Silver halides are highly insoluble in aqueous solutions and are used in gravimetric analytical methods  Silver oxide  Ag2O   produced when silver nitrate solutions are treated with a base  is used as a positive electrode  anode  in watch batteries  Silver carbonate  Ag2CO3  is precipitated when silver nitrate is treated with sodium carbonate  Na2CO3   12  2 AgNO3   2 OH    Ag2O   H2O   2 NO3  2 AgNO3   Na2CO3   Ag2CO3   2 NaNO3 Silver fulminate  AgONC   a powerful  touch sensitive explosive used in percussion caps  is made by reaction of silver metal with nitric acid in the presence of ethanol  C2H5OH   Another dangerously explosive silver compound is silver azide  AgN3   formed by reaction of silver nitrate with sodium azide  NaN3   13  Latent images formed in silver halide crystals are developed by treatment with alkaline solutions of reducing agents such as hydroquinone  metol  4  methylamino phenol sulfate  or ascorbate  which reduce the exposed halide to silver metal  Alkaline solutions of silver nitrate can be reduced to silver metal by reducing sugars such as glucose  and this reaction is used to silver glass mirrors and the interior of glass Christmas ornaments  Silver halides are soluble in solutions of sodium thiosulfate  Na2S2O3  which is used as a photographic fixer  to remove excess silver halide from photographic emulsions after image development  12  Silver metal is attacked by strong oxidizers such as potassium permanganate  KMnO4  and potassium dichromate  K2Cr2O7   and in the presence of potassium bromide  KBr   these compounds are used in photography to bleach silver images  converting them to silver halides that can either be fixed with thiosulfate or redeveloped to intensify the original image  Silver forms cyanide complexes  silver cyanide  that are soluble in water in the presence of an excess of cyanide ions  Silver cyanide solutions are used in electroplating of silver  12   edit  Applications Many well known uses of silver involve its precious metal properties  including currency  decorative items and mirrors  The contrast between the appearance of its bright white color to other media makes it very useful to the visual arts  It has also long been used to confer high monetary value as objects  such as silver coins and investment bars  or make objects symbolic of high social or political rank   edit  Currency Main articles  Silver coin and Silver standard Silver  in the form of electrum  a gold silver alloy   was coined to produce money around 700 BC by the Lydians  Later  silver was refined and coined in its pure form  Many nations used silver as the basic unit of monetary value  In the modern world  silver bullion has the ISO currency code XAG  The name of the pound sterling     reflects the fact it originally represented the value of one troy pound of sterling silver  other historical currencies  such as the French livre  have similar etymologies  During the 19th century  the bimetallism that prevailed in most countries was undermined by the discovery of large deposits of silver in the Americas  fearing a sharp decrease in the value of silver and thus the currency  most states switched to a gold standard by 1900  In the Spanish language  Plata means both silver and money  The 20th century saw a gradual movement to fiat currency  with most of the world monetary system losing its link to precious metals after Richard Nixon took the United States dollar off the gold standard in 1971  the last currency backed by gold was the Swiss franc  which became a pure fiat currency on 1 May 2000  During this same period  silver gradually ceased to be used in circulating coins  the United States minted its last circulating silver coin in 1969   edit  Jewelry and silverware Silver plate with goddess Minerva from the Hildesheim Treasure  1st century BC Royal Military College of Canada truth duty valour Collar pin  1920 53  in Silver  3 lugs  Main articles  jewelry and silversmith Jewelry and silverware are traditionally made from sterling silver  standard silver   an alloy of 92 5  silver with 7 5  copper  In the US  only an alloy consisting of at least 90 0  fine silver can be marketed as  silver   thus frequently stamped 900   Sterling silver  stamped 925  is harder than pure silver  and has a lower melting point  893  C  than either pure silver or pure copper  6 Britannia silver is an alternative  hallmark quality standard containing 95 8  silver  often used to make silver tableware and wrought plate  With the addition of germanium  the patented modified alloy Argentium Sterling silver is formed  with improved properties  including resistance to firescale  Sterling silver jewelry is often plated with a thin coat of  999 fine silver to give the item a shiny finish  This process is called  flashing   Silver jewelry can also be plated with rhodium  for a bright  shiny look  or gold  Silver is a constituent of almost all colored carat gold alloys and carat gold solders  giving the alloys paler color and greater hardness  14  White 9 carat gold contains 62 5  silver and 37 5  gold  while 22 carat gold contains up to 91 7  gold and 8 4  silver or copper or a mixture of both  14  Historically  the training and guild organization of goldsmiths included silversmiths as well  and the two crafts remain largely overlapping  Unlike blacksmiths  silversmiths do not shape the metal while it is red hot  but instead  work it at room temperature with gentle and carefully placed hammer blows  The essence of silversmithing is to take a flat piece of metal and to transform it into a useful object using different hammers  stakes and other simple tools  15  While silversmiths specialize in  and principally work  silver  they also work with other metals  such as gold  copper  steel  and brass  They make jewelry  silverware  armor  vases  and other artistic items  Because silver is such a malleable metal  silversmiths have a large range of choices with how they prefer to work the metal  Historically  silversmiths are mostly referred to as goldsmiths  which was usually the same guild  In the western Canadian silversmith tradition  guilds do not exist  however  mentoring through colleagues becomes a method of professional learning within a community of craftspeople  16  Silver is much cheaper than gold  though still valuable  and so is very popular with jewelers who are just starting out and cannot afford to make pieces in gold  or as a practicing material for goldsmith apprentices  Silver has also become very fashionable  and is used frequently in more artistic jewelry pieces  Traditionally  silversmiths mostly made  silverware   cutlery  table flatware  bowls  candlesticks and such   Only in more recent times has silversmithing become mainly work in jewelry  as much less solid silver tableware is now handmade   edit  Dentistry Silver can be alloyed with mercury  tin and other metals at room temperature to make amalgams that are widely used for dental fillings  To make dental amalgam  a mixture of powdered silver and other metals is mixed with mercury to make a stiff paste that can be adapted to the shape of a cavity  The dental amalgam achieves initial hardness within minutes but sets hard in a few hours   edit  Photography and electronics Photography used 30 98  of the silver consumed in 1998 in the form of silver nitrate and silver halides  In 2001  23 47  was used for photography  while 20 03  was used in jewelry  38 51  for industrial uses  and only 3 5  for coins and medals  The use of silver in photography has rapidly declined  due to the lower demand for consumer color film from the advent of digital technology  since 2007  of the 894 5 million ounces of silver in supply  just 128 3 million ounces  14 3   were consumed by the photographic sector  and the total amount of silver consumed in 2007 by the photographic sector compared to 1998 is just 50   17  Some electrical and electronic products use silver for its superior conductivity  even when tarnished  The primary example of this is in high quality RF connectors  The increase in conductivity is also taken advantage of in RF engineering at VHF and higher frequencies  where conductors often cannot be scaled by 6   due to tuning requirements  e g cavity filters  As an additional example  printed circuits and RFID antennas can be made using silver paints  6  18  and computer keyboards use silver electrical contacts  Silver cadmium oxide is used in high voltage contacts because it can withstand arcing  Some manufacturers produce audio connector cables  speaker wires  and power cables using silver conductors  which have a 6  higher conductivity than ordinary copper ones of identical dimensions  but cost very much more  Though debatable  many hi fi enthusiasts believe silver wires improve sound quality  citation needed  Small devices  such as hearing aids and watches  commonly use silver oxide batteries due to their long life and high energy to weight ratio  Another usage is high capacity silver zinc and silver cadmium batteries   edit  Mirrors and optics Mirrors which need superior reflectivity for visible light are made with silver as the reflecting material in a process called silvering  though common mirrors are backed with aluminium  Using a process called sputtering  silver  and sometimes gold  can be applied to glass at various thicknesses  allowing different amounts of light to penetrate  Silver is usually reserved for coatings of specialized optics  and the silvering most often seen in architectural glass and tinted windows on vehicles is produced by sputtered aluminium  which is cheaper and less susceptible to tarnishing and corrosion  19  Silver is the reflective coating of choice for solar reflectors  20   edit  Other industrial and commercial applications This Yanagisawa A9932J alto saxophone has a solid silver bell and neck with solid phosphor bronze body  The bell  neck and key cups are extensively engraved  It was manufactured in 2008  Silver and silver alloys are used in the construction of high quality musical wind instruments of many types  21  Flutes  in particular  are commonly constructed of silver alloy or silver plated  both for appearance and for the frictional surface properties of silver  22  Silver s catalytic properties make it ideal for use as a catalyst in oxidation reactions  for example  the production of formaldehyde from methanol and air by means of silver screens or crystallites containing a minimum 99 95 weight percent silver  Silver  upon some suitable support  is probably the only catalyst available today to convert ethylene to ethylene oxide  later hydrolyzed to ethylene glycol  used for making polyesters   an important industrial reaction  It is also used in the Oddy test to detect reduced sulfur compounds and carbonyl sulfides  Because silver readily absorbs free neutrons  it is commonly used to make control rods to regulate the fission chain reaction in pressurized water nuclear reactors  generally in the form of an alloy containing 80  silver  15  indium  and 5  cadmium  Silver is used to make solder and brazing alloys  and as a thin layer on bearing surfaces can provide a significant increase in galling resistance and reduce wear under heavy load  particularly against steel   edit  Medical Main article  Medical uses of silver Silver ions and silver compounds show a toxic effect on some bacteria  viruses  algae and fungi  typical for heavy metals like lead or mercury  but without the high toxicity to humans normally associated with these other metals  Its germicidal effects kill many microbial organisms in vitro  but testing and standardization of silver products is difficult  23  Hippocrates  the  father of medicine   24  wrote that silver had beneficial healing and antidisease properties  and the Phoenicians stored water  wine  and vinegar in silver bottles to prevent spoiling  In the early 20th century  people where   would put silver coins in milk bottles to prolong the milk s freshness  25  Its germicidal effects increased its value in utensils and as jewellery  The exact process of silver s germicidal effect is still not entirely understood  although theories exist  One of these is the oligodynamic effect  which explains the effect on microorganisms  but would not explain antiviral effects  Silver is widely used in topical gels and impregnated into bandages because of its wide spectrum antimicrobial activity  The antimicrobial properties of silver stem from the chemical properties of its ionized form  Ag   This ion forms strong molecular bonds with other substances used by bacteria to respire  such as molecules containing sulfur  nitrogen  and oxygen  26  When the Ag  ion forms a complex with these molecules  they are rendered unusable by the bacteria  depriving them of necessary compounds and eventually leading to their death  Silver compounds were used to prevent infection in World War I before the advent of antibiotics  Silver nitrate solution use continued  then was largely replaced by silver sulfadiazine cream  SSD cream   27  which generally became the  standard of care  for the antibacterial and antibiotic treatment of serious burns until the late 1990s  28  Now  other options  such as silver coated dressings  activated silver dressings   are used in addition to SSD cream  However  the evidence for the effectiveness of such silver treated dressings is mixed  and although the evidence is promising  it is marred by the poor quality of the trials used to assess these products  Consequently  a systematic review by the Cochrane Collaboration  published in 2008  found insufficient evidence to recommend the use of silver treated dressings to treat infected wounds  29  There has been renewed interest in silver as a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent  One application has silver being used with alginate  a naturally occurring biopolymer derived from seaweed  in a range of products designed to prevent infections as part of wound management procedures  particularly applicable to burn victims  30  In 2007  a company introduced a glass product they claimed had antibacterial properties by coating the glass with a thin layer of silver  31  In addition  in 2007 the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  approved an endotracheal breathing tube with a fine coat of silver for use in mechanical ventilation  after studies found it reduced the risk of ventilator associated pneumonia  32  Another example uses the known enhanced antibacterial action of silver by applying an electric field  In 2009  the antibacterial action of silver electrodes was found to be greatly improved if the electrodes were covered with silver nanorods  33  The University of Missouri has found silver nanoparticles threaten benign bacteria which extract ammonia from sewage treatment systems  A serious concern is the eventual spread of the toxin into rivers  streams  lakes and ultimately the oceans  34  A note of caution is sounded by Martin A  Philbert  professor of toxicology at the University of Michigan  Ann Arbor   In the context of environmental health  the scientific community will have to pay close attention to those physicochemical properties of engineered nanomaterials that defeat or circumvent normal cellular processes and lend themselves to indiscriminate penetration of biological barriers  tissues  and cellular systems    35  Silver is commonly used in catheters  Silver alloy catheters are more effective than standard catheters for reducing bacteriuria in adults having short term catheterisation in hospitals  This meta analysis clarifies discrepant results among trials of silver coated urinary catheters by revealing silver alloy catheters are significantly more effective in preventing urinary tract infections than are silver oxide catheters  Though silver alloy urinary catheters cost about  6 more than standard urinary catheters  they may be worth the extra cost  since catheter related infection is a common cause of nosocomial infection and bacteremia  36  Various silver compounds  devices to make homeopathic solutions and colloidal silver suspensions are sold as remedies for numerous conditions  Although most colloidal silver preparations are harmless  there are cases where excessive consumption led to argyria over a period of months or years  37  High consumption doses of colloidal silver can result in coma  pleural edema  and hemolysis  38   edit  Clothing Silver inhibits the growth of bacteria and fungi on clothing  such as socks  so is added to reduce odors and the risk of bacterial and fungal infection  It is incorporated into clothing or shoes either by integrating silver nanoparticles into the polymer from which yarns are made or by coating yarns with silver  39  40  The loss of silver during washing varies between textile technologies  and the resultant effect on the environment is not yet fully known  41  42   edit  History The crescent moon has been used since ancient times to represent silver  Silver has been used for thousands of years for ornaments and utensils  for trade  and as the basis for many monetary systems  Its value as a precious metal was long considered second only to gold  The word  silver  appears in Anglo Saxon in various spellings such as seolfor and siolfor  A similar form is seen throughout the Germanic languages  compare Old High German silabar and silbir   The chemical symbol Ag is from the Latin for  silver   argentum  compare Greek           rgyros   from the Indo European root  arg  meaning  white  or  shining   Silver has been known since ancient times  Mentioned in the book of Genesis  slag heaps found in Asia Minor and on the islands of the Aegean Sea indicate silver was being separated from lead as early as the 4th millennium BC using surface mining  6  The stability of the Roman currency relied to a high degree on the supply of silver bullion  which Roman miners produced on a scale unparalleled before the discovery of the New World  43  44  Reaching a peak production of 200 t per year  an estimated silver stock of 10 000 t circulated in the Roman economy in the middle of the second century AD  five to ten times larger than the combined amount of silver available to medieval Europe and the Caliphate around 800 AD  43  44  Recorded use of silver to prevent infection dates to ancient Greece and Rome  it was rediscovered in the Middle Ages  when it was used for several purposes  such as to disinfect water and food during storage  and also for the treatment of burns and wounds as wound dressing  In the 19th century  sailors on long ocean voyages would put silver coins in barrels of water and wine to keep the liquid potable  Pioneers in America used the same idea as they made their journey from coast to coast  Silver solutions were approved in the 1920s by the US Food and Drug Administration for use as antibacterial agents  In the Gospels  Jesus  disciple Judas Iscariot is infamous for having taken a bribe of thirty coins of silver from religious leaders in Jerusalem to turn Jesus Christ over to the Romans  In certain circumstances  Islam permits Muslim men to wear silver jewelry  Muhammad himself wore a silver signet ring  citation needed  45   edit  World War II During World War II  the short supply of copper led to the substitution of silver in many industrial applications  The United States government loaned out silver from its massive reserve located in the West Point vaults to a wide range of industrial users  One very important use was for bus bars for new aluminum plants needed to make aircraft  During the war many electrical connectors and switches were silver plated  Another use was aircraft master rod bearings and other types of bearings  Since silver can replace tin in solder at a lower volume  a large amount of tin was freed up for other uses by substituting government silver  Silver was also used as the reflector in searchlights and other types of lights  One high tech use of silver was for conductors at Oak Ridge National Laboratory used in calutrons to isolate uranium as part of the Manhattan project   After the war ended the silver was returned to the vaults   46  Silver was used in nickels during the war to save that metal for use in steel alloys   edit  Occurrence and extraction Main article  Silver mining Native silver Time trend of silver production Silver is found in native form  as an alloy with gold  electrum   and in ores containing sulfur  arsenic  antimony or chlorine  Ores include argentite  Ag2S   chlorargyrite  AgCl  which includes horn silver  and pyrargyrite  Ag3SbS3   The principal sources of silver are the ores of copper  copper nickel  lead  and lead zinc obtained from Peru  Bolivia  Mexico  China  Australia  Chile  Poland and Serbia  6  Peru  Bolivia and Mexico have been mining silver since 1546  and are still major world producers  Top silver producing mines are Cannington  Australia   Fresnillo  Mexico   San Cristobal  Bolivia   Antamina  Peru   Rudna  Poland   and Penasquito  Mexico   47  Top near term mine development projects through 2015 are Pascua Lama  Chile   Navidad  Argentina   Jaunicipio  Mexico   Malku Khota  Bolivia   48  and Hackett River  Canada   47  The metal is primarily produced through electrolytic copper refining  gold  nickel and zinc refining  and by application of the Parkes process on lead metal obtained from lead ores that contain small amounts of silver  Commercial grade fine silver is at least 99 9  pure  and purities greater than 99 999  are available  In 2010  Peru was the top producer of silver  4 000 tonnes or 18  of the world s total   closely followed by Mexico  3 500 t  and China  3 000 t   49   edit  Price Main articles  Silver as an investment and Silver standard Silver output in 2005 Silver price history in 1960 2011 At an April 2011 price of about  49 USD per troy ounce  50  silver is about 1 30th the price of gold  The ratio has varied from 1 15 to 1 100 in the past 100 years  citation needed  In 1980  the silver price rose to a peak for modern times of US 49 45 per troy ounce  ozt  due to market manipulation of Nelson Bunker Hunt and Herbert Hunt inflation adjusted to 2011 this is approximately U D150 per troy ounce  citation needed  Some time after Silver Thursday  the price was back to  10 ozt  51  From 2001 to 2010  the price moved from  4 37 to  20 19  Average London US  oz   52  According to the Silver Institute  silver s recent gains have greatly stemmed from a rise in investor interest and an increase in fabrication demand  52  In late April 2011  silver reached an all time high of  49 76 ozt  In earlier times  silver has commanded much higher prices  In the early 15th century  the price of silver is estimated to have surpassed  1200 per ounce  based on 2011 dollars  53  The discovery of massive silver deposits in the New World during the succeeding centuries has caused the price to diminish greatly  The price of silver is important in Judaic law  The lowest fiscal amount a Jewish court  or Beth Din  can convene to adjudicate a case over is a shova pruta  value of a Babylonian pruta coin  citation needed   This is fixed at 1 8 of a gram of pure  unrefined silver  at market price  In a Jewish tradition  still continuing today  on the first birth day of a first born son  the parents pay the price of five pure silver coins to a Kohen  priest   Today  the Israel mint fixes the coins at 117 grams of silver  The Kohen will often give those silver coins back as a gift for the child to inherit  54   edit  Human exposure and consumption Silver plays no known natural biological role in humans  and possible health effects of silver are a disputed subject  Silver itself is not toxic  but most silver salts are  and some may be carcinogenic  dubious   discuss  Silver and compounds containing it  such as colloidal silver  can be absorbed into the circulatory system and become deposited in various body tissues  leading to argyria  which results in a blue grayish pigmentation of the skin  eyes  and
