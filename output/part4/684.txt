Central Asia From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search Central Asia Area 4 003 400 km2  1 545 721 sq mi  1  Population 64 746 854 2  Density 15  km2  39  sq mi  Countries

Caspian Sea in the west to China in the east and from Afghanistan in the south to Russia in the north  It is also sometimes referred to as Middle Asia  and  colloquially   the  stans   as the five countries generally considered to be within the region all have names ending with that suffix  3  and is within the scope of the wider Eurasian continent  In modern contexts  all definitions of Central Asia include these five republics of the former Soviet Union  Kazakhstan  pop  16 6 million   Kyrgyzstan  5 5 million   Tajikistan  7 6 million   Turkmenistan  5 1 million   and Uzbekistan  29 5 million   for a total population of 64 7 million as of 2012  Other areas included are Afghanistan  northeastern Iran  northern Pakistan  Mongolia  and sometimes Xinjiang and Tibet in western China and southern Siberia in eastern Russia  Various definitions of its exact composition exist  and no one definition is universally accepted  Despite this uncertainty in defining borders  it does have some important overall characteristics  For one  Central Asia has historically been closely tied to its nomadic peoples and the Silk Road  4  As a result  it has acted as a crossroads for the movement of people  goods  and ideas between Europe  West Asia  South Asia  and East Asia  5  During pre Islamic and early Islamic times  Central Asia was a predominantly Iranian 6  7  region that included the sedentary Eastern Iranic speaking Bactrians  Sogdians and Chorasmians  and the semi nomadic Scythians and Alans  The ancient sedentary population played an important role in the history of Central Asia  After expansion by Turkic peoples  Central Asia also became the homeland for many Turkic peoples  including the Kazakhs  Uzbeks  Turkmen  Kyrgyz and Uyghurs  Central Asia is sometimes referred to as Turkestan  From the 17th century  up to the end of the 20th century  most of Central Asia has been part of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union  both being Slavic majority countries  As of 2011  the  stans  are still home to about 7 million Russians and 500 thousand Ukrainians  8  9  10  Contents 1 Definitions 2 Geography 3 Divisions 3 1 Climate 4 History 5 Culture 5 1 Religions 5 2

distinct region of the world was introduced in 1843 by the geographer Alexander von Humboldt  The borders of Central Asia are subject to multiple definitions  The most limited definition was the official one of the Soviet Union  which defined Middle Asia as consisting solely of Uzbekistan  Turkmenistan  Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan  This definition was also often used outside the USSR during this period  However  the Russian culture has two distinct terms                Srednjaja Azija or  Middle Asia   the narrower definition  which includes only those traditionally non Slavic  Central Asian lands that were incorporated within those borders of historical Russia  and                   Central naja Azija or  Central Asia   the wider definition  which includes Central Asian lands that have never been part of historical Russia   Soon after independence  the leaders of the four former Soviet Central Asian Republics met in Tashkent and declared that the definition of Central Asia should include Kazakhstan as well as the original four included by the Soviets  Since then  this has become the most common definition of Central Asia  The UNESCO general history of Central Asia  written just before the collapse of the USSR  defines the region based on climate and uses far larger borders  According to it  Central Asia includes Mongolia  Tibet  northeast Iran  Golestan  North Khorasan and Razavi provinces   Afghanistan  Northern Areas  Khyber Pakhtunkhwa  also called N W F P    Azad Kashmir and Punjab provinces of Pakistan  Punjab  Kashmir and Ladakh of India  central east Russia south of the Taiga  and the former Central Asian Soviet republics  the five  Stans  of the former Soviet Union   An alternative method is to define the region based on ethnicity  and in particular  areas populated by Eastern Turkic  Eastern Iranian  or Mongolian peoples  These areas include Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region  the Turkic regions of southern Siberia  the five republics  and Afghan Turkestan  Afghanistan as a whole  the Northern Areas of Pakistan and the Kashmir Valley may also be included  The Tibetans and Ladakhi are also included  Insofar  most of the mentioned peoples are considered the  indigenous  peoples of the vast region  There are several places that claim to be the geographic center of Asia  for example Kyzyl  the capital of Tuva in the Russian Federation  and a village 200 miles  320 km  north of  r mqi  the capital of the Xinjiang region of China  11   edit  Geography United Nations geoscheme for Asia    North Asia   Central Asia   Southwest Asia   South Asia   East Asia   Southeast Asia Central Asia is an extremely large region of varied geography  including high passes and mountains  Tian Shan   vast deserts  Kara Kum  Kyzyl Kum  Taklamakan   and especially treeless  grassy steppes  The vast steppe areas of Central Asia are considered together with the steppes of Eastern Europe as a homogeneous geographical zone known as the Eurasian Steppe  Much of the land of Central Asia is too dry or too rugged for farming  The Gobi desert extends from the foot of the Pamirs  77  E  to the Great Khingan  Da Hinggan  Mountains  116  118  E  Central Asia has the following geographic extremes  The world s northernmost desert  sand dunes   at Buurug Deliin Els  Mongolia  50 18  N  The Northern Hemisphere s southernmost permafrost  at Erdenetsogt sum  Mongolia  46 17  N  The world s shortest distance between non frozen desert and permafrost  770 km  480 mi   The Eurasian pole of inaccessibility  A majority of the people earn a living by herding livestock  Industrial activity centers in the region s cities  Major rivers of the region include the Amu Darya  the Syr Darya  the Hari River and the Murghab River  Major bodies of water include the Aral Sea and Lake Balkhash  both of which are part of the huge west central Asian endorheic basin that also includes the Caspian Sea  Both of these bodies of water have shrunk significantly in recent decades due to diversion of water from rivers that feed them for irrigation and industrial purposes  Water is an extremely valuable resource in arid Central Asia and can lead to rather significant international disputes   edit  Divisions The northern belt is part of the Eurasian Steppe  In the northwest  north of the Caspian Sea  Central Asia merges into the Russian Steppe  To the northeast  Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin may sometimes be included in Central Asia  Just west of Dzungaria  Zhetysu  or Semirechye  is south of Lake Balkhash and north of the Tian Shan Mountains  Khorezm is south of the Aral Sea along the Amu Darya  Southeast of the Aral Sea  Maveranahr is between the Amu Darya and Syr Darya  Transoxiana is the land north of the middle and upper Amu Darya  Oxus   Bactria included northern Afghanistan and the upper Amu Darya  Sogdiana was north of Bactria and included the trading cities of Bukhara and Samarkhand  Khorasan and Margiana approximate northeastern Iran  The Kyzyl Kum Desert is northeast of the Amu Darya  and the Karakum Desert southwest of it   edit  Climate Since Central Asia is not buffered by a large body of water  temperature fluctuations are more severe  According to the WWF Ecozones system  Central Asia is part of the Palearctic ecozone  The largest biome in Central Asia is the temperate grasslands  savannas  and shrublands biome  Central Asia also contains the montane grasslands and shrublands  deserts and xeric shrublands and temperate coniferous forests biomes   edit  History Main article  History of Central Asia Geographical extent of Iranian influence in the 1st century BC  Scythia  mostly Eastern Iranian  is shown in orange  The history of Central Asia is defined by the area s climate and geography  The aridness of the region made agriculture difficult  and its distance from the sea cut it off from much trade  Thus  few major cities developed in the region  instead  the area was for millennia dominated by the nomadic horse peoples of the steppe  Relations between the steppe nomads and the settled people in and around Central Asia were long marked by conflict  The nomadic lifestyle was well suited to warfare  and the steppe horse riders became some of the most militarily potent peoples in the world  limited only by their lack of internal unity  Any internal unity that was achieved was most probably due to the influence of the Silk Road  which traveled along Central Asia  Periodically  great leaders or changing conditions would organize several tribes into one force and create an almost unstoppable power  These included the Hun invasion of Europe  the Wu Hu attacks on China and most notably the Mongol conquest of much of Eurasia  12  Uzbek men from Khiva During pre Islamic and early Islamic times  southern Central Asia was inhabited predominantly by speakers of Iranian languages  6  13  Among the ancient sedentary Iranian peoples  the Sogdians and Chorasmians played an important role  while Iranian peoples such as Scythians and the later on Alans lived a nomadic or semi nomadic lifestyle  The well preserved Tarim mummies with Caucasoid features have been found in the Tarim Basin  14  The main migration of Turkic peoples occurred between the 5th and 10th centuries  when they spread across most of Central Asia  During the 13th and 14th centuries  the Mongols conquered and ruled the largest contiguous empire in recorded history  Most of Central Asia fell under the control of the Chagatai Khanate  Kazakh man on a horse with golden eagle The dominance of the nomads ended in the 16th century  as firearms allowed settled peoples to gain control of the region  Russia  China  and other powers expanded into the region and had captured the bulk of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century  After the Russian Revolution  the western Central Asian regions were incorporated into the Soviet Union  The eastern part Central Asia  known as East Turkistan or Xinjiang  was incorporated into the People s Republic of China  Mongolia remained independent but became a Soviet satellite state  Afghanistan remained relatively independent of major influence by the USSR until the Soviet invasion of 1979  The Soviet areas of Central Asia saw much industrialization and construction of infrastructure  but also the suppression of local cultures  hundreds of thousands of deaths from failed collectivization programs  and a lasting legacy of ethnic tensions and environmental problems  Soviet authorities deported millions of people  including entire nationalities  15  from western areas of the USSR to Central Asia and Siberia  16  According to Touraj Atabaki and Sanjyot Mehendale   From 1959 to 1970  about two million people from various parts of the Soviet Union migrated to Central Asia  of which about one million moved to Kazakhstan   17  With the collapse of the Soviet Union  five countries gained independence  In nearly all the new states  former Communist Party officials retained power as local strongmen  None of the new republics could be considered functional democracies in the early days of independence  although in recent years Kyrgyzstan  Kazakhstan and Mongolia have made further progress towards more open societies  unlike Uzbekistan  Tajikistan  and Turkmenistan  which have maintained many Soviet style repressive tactics  18   edit  Culture The  rtogrul Gazy Mosque in Ashgabat named after the father of Osman Ghazi  the founder of the Ottoman Empire  edit  Religions Further information  Islam in Central Asia Islam is the religion most common in the Central Asian Republics  Afghanistan  Xinjiang and the peripheral western regions  such as Bashkiria  Most Central Asian Muslims are Sunni  although there are sizable Shia minorities in Afghanistan and Tajikistan  Zoroastrianism  a religion with origins in Afghanistan  was a major faith in Central Asia prior to the arrival of Islam  Its influence is still felt today in such celebrations as Nowruz  held in all five of the  core  Central Asian states  Buddhism was a prominent religion in Central Asia prior to the arrival of Islam  and the transmission of Buddhism along the Silk Road eventually brought the religion to China  Amongst the Turkic peoples  Tengrianism was the popular religion before arrival of Islam  Tibetan Buddhism is most common in Tibet  Mongolia  Ladakh and the southern Russian regions of Siberia  where Shamanism is also popular  including forms of divination  such as Kumalak   Contact and migration with Han people from China has brought Confucianism and other beliefs into the region  Nestorianism was the form of Christianity most practiced in the region in previous centuries  but now the largest denomination is the Russian Orthodox Church  with many members in Kazakhstan  The Bukharan Jews were once a sizable community in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan  but nearly all have emigrated since the dissolution of the Soviet Union   edit  Arts Further information  Music of Central Asia Yama  the Lord of Death  Note the human skulls and severed heads that festoon Yama s crown and necklace  which give some concept of the size that Yama was expected to be when one faced him at one s death  This particular Dharmapala is painted wood  four feet high in total  At the crossroads of Asia  shamanistic practices live alongside Buddhism  Thus  Yama  Lord of Death  was revered in Tibet as a spiritual guardian and judge  Mongolian Buddhism  in particular  was influenced by Tibetan Buddhism  The Qianlong Emperor of China in the 18th century was Tibetan Buddhist and would sometimes travel from Beijing to other cities for personal religious worship  Central Asia also has an indigenous form of improvisational oral poetry that is over 1000 years old  It is principally practiced in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan by akyns  lyrical improvisationists  They engage in lyrical battles  the aitysh or the alym sabak  The tradition arose out of early bardic oral historians  They are usually accompanied by a stringed instrument in Kyrgyzstan  a three stringed komuz  and in Kazakhstan  a similar two stringed instrument  the dombra  Photography in Central Asia began to develop after 1882  when a Russian Mennonite photographer named Wilhelm Penner moved to the Khanate of Khiva during the Mennonite migration to Central Asia led by Claas Epp  Jr   Upon his arrival to Khanate of Khiva  Penner shared his photography skills with a local student Khudaybergen Divanov  who later became the founder of the Uzbek photography  19  Some also learn to sing the Manas  Kyrgyzstan s epic poem  those who learn the Manas exclusively but do not improvise are called manaschis   During Soviet rule  akyn performance was co opted by the authorities and subsequently declined in popularity  With the fall of the Soviet Union  it has enjoyed a resurgence  although akyns still do use their art to campaign for political candidates  A 2005 Washington Post article proposed a similarity between the improvisational art of akyns and modern freestyle rap performed in the West  20  As a consequence of Russian colonization  European fine arts   painting  sculpture and graphics   have developed in Central Asia  The first years of the Soviet regime saw the appearance of modernism  which took inspiration from the Russian avant garde movement  Until the 80 s Central Asian arts had developed along with general tendencies of Soviet arts  In the 90 s  arts of the region underwent some significant changes  Institutionally speaking  some fields of arts were regulated by the birth of the art market  some stayed as representatives of official views  while many were sponsored by international organizations  The years of 1990   2000 were times for the establishment of contemporary arts  In the region  many important international exhibitions are taking place  Central Asian art is represented in European and American museums  and the Central Asian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale has been organized since 2005   edit  Territory and region data Country Area km  Population  2009  Population density per km

European language  was once spoken in Xinjiang and parts of Afghanistan  but is now extinct   edit  Geostrategy Main article  Geostrategy in Central Asia Central Asia has long been a strategic location merely because of its proximity to several great powers on the Eurasian landmass  The region itself never held a dominant stationary population nor was able to make use of natural resources  Thus  it has rarely throughout history become the seat of power for an empire or influential state  Central Asia has been divided  redivided  conquered out of existence  and fragmented time and time again  Central Asia has served more as the battleground for outside powers than as a power in its own right  Central Asia had both the advantage and disadvantage of a central location between four historical seats of power  From its central location  it has access to trade routes to and from all the regional powers  On the other hand  it has been continuously vulnerable to attack from all sides throughout its history  resulting in political fragmentation or outright power vacuum  as it is successively dominated  Political cartoon from the period of the Great Game showing the Afghan Amir Sher Ali with his  friends  Imperial Russia and the United Kingdom  1878  To the North  the steppe allowed for rapid mobility  first for nomadic horseback warriors like the Huns and Mongols  and later for Russian traders  eventually supported by railroads  As the Russian Empire expanded to the East  it would also push down into Central Asia towards the sea  in a search for warm water ports  The Soviet bloc would reinforce dominance from the North and attempt to project power as far south as Afghanistan  To the East  the demographic and cultural weight of Chinese empires continually pushed outward into Central Asia  The Manchu Qing dynasty would conquer Xinjiang and Tibet  However  with the Sino Soviet split  China would project power into Central Asia  most notably in the case of Afghanistan  to counter Russian dominance of the region  To the Southeast  the demographic and cultural influence of India was felt in Central Asia  notably in Tibet  the Hindu Kush  and slightly beyond  Several historical Indian dynasties  especially those seated along the Indus River  would expand into Central Asia  India s ability to project power into Central Asia has been limited due to the mountain ranges in Pakistan  as well as the cultural differences between Hindu India and what would become a mostly Muslim Central Asia  From its base in India  the British Empire competed with the Russian Empire for influence in the region in the 19th and 20th centuries  To the Southwest  Western Asian powers have expanded into the southern areas of Central Asia  usually Uzbekistan  Afghanistan  and Pakistan   Several Persian empires would conquer and reconquer parts of Central Asia  Alexander the Great s Hellenic empire would extend into Central Asia  two Islamic empires would exert substantial influence throughout the region  and the modern state of Iran has projected influence throughout the region as well  In the post Cold War era  Central Asia is an ethnic cauldron  prone to instability and conflicts  without a sense of national identity  but rather a mess of historical cultural influences  tribal and clan loyalties  and religious fervor  Projecting influence into the area is no longer just Russia  but also Turkey  Iran  China  Pakistan  India and the United States  Russia continues to dominate political decision making throughout the former SSRs  although  as other countries move into the area  Russia s influence has begun to wane  The United States  with its military involvement in the region and oil diplomacy  is also significantly involved in the region s politics  The United States and other NATO members are the main contributors to the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan and also exert considerable influence in other Central Asian nations  China has security ties with Central Asian states through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization  and conducts energy trade bilaterally  24  India has geographic proximity to the Central Asian region and  in addition  enjoys considerable influence on Afghanistan  25  26  India maintains a military base at Farkhor  Tajikistan  and also has extensive military relations with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan  27  Turkey also exerts considerable influence in the region on account of its ethnic and linguistic ties with the Turkic peoples of Central Asia and its involvement in the Baku Tbilisi Ceyhan oil pipeline  Political and economic relations are growing rapidly  e g   Turkey recently eliminated visa requirements for citizens of the Central Asian Turkic republics   Iran  the seat of historical empires that controlled parts of Central Asia  has historical and cultural links to the region and is vying to construct an oil pipeline from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf  Pakistan  a nuclear armed Islamic state  has a history of political relations with neighboring Afghanistan and is termed capable of exercising influence  For some Central Asian nations  the shortest route to the ocean lies through Pakistan  Pakistan seeks natural gas from Central Asia and supports the development of pipelines from its countries  The mountain ranges and areas in northern Pakistan lie on the fringes of greater Central Asia  the Gilgit Baltistan region of Pakistan lies adjacent to Tajikistan  separated only by the narrow Afghan Wakhan Corridor  Being located on the northwest of South Asia  the area forming modern day Pakistan maintained extensive historical and cultural links with the region   edit  War on Terror In the context of the United States  War on Terror  Central Asia has once again become the center of geostrategic calculations  Pakistan s status has been upgraded by the U S  government to Major non NATO ally because of its central role in serving as a staging point for the invasion of Afghanistan  providing intelligence on Al Qaeda operations in the region  and leading the hunt on Osama bin Laden  Afghanistan  which had served as a haven and source of support for Al Qaeda under the protection of Mullah Omar and the Taliban  was the target of a U S  invasion in 2001 and ongoing reconstruction and drug eradication efforts  U S  military bases have also been established in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan  causing both Russia and the People s Republic of China to voice their concern over a permanent U S  military presence in the region  Western governments have accused Russia  China and the former Soviet republics of justifying the suppression of separatist movements  and the associated ethnics and religion with the War on Terror   edit  Major cultural and economic centres

Kazakhstan gained its independence in 1991  the city and the region were renamed Aqmola  The name was often translated as  White Tombstone   but actually means  Holy Place  or  Holy Shrine   The  White Tombstone  literal translation was too appropriate for many visitors to escape notice in almost all guide books and travel accounts  In 1994  the city was designated as the future capital of the newly independent country and again renamed to the present Astana after the capital was officially moved from Almaty in 1997  Almaty  Kazakhstan 1 421 868  2010  It was the capital of Kazakhstan  and

C  Edmund Bosworth   In early Islamic times Persians tended to identify all the lands to the northeast of Khorasan and lying beyond the Oxus with the region of Turan  which in the Shahnama of Ferdowsi is regarded as the land allotted to Fereydun s son Tur  The denizens of Turan were held to include the Turks  in the first four centuries of Islam essentially those nomadizing beyond the Jaxartes  and behind them the Chinese  see Kowalski  Minorsky   Turan    Turan thus became both an ethnic and a diareeah term  but always containing ambiguities and contradictions  arising from the fact that all through Islamic times the lands immediately beyond the Oxus and along its lower reaches were the homes not of Turks but of Iranian peoples  such as the Sogdians and Khwarezmians     C E  Bosworth
