Czech pronunciation    t  sk    is a landlocked country in Central Europe  The country is bordered by Germany to the west  Poland to the north  Austria to the south and Slovakia to the east  Its capital and largest city  with 1 3 million inhabitants  is Prague  It is a pluralist multi party parliamentary representative democracy  a member of the European Union  NATO  the OECD  the OSCE  the Council of Europe and the Visegr d Group  The Czech state  formerly known as Bohemia  was formed in the late 9th century as a small duchy around Prague  at that time under dominance of the powerful Great Moravian Empire  which reached its greatest territorial extent during the reign of Svatopluk I from the House of Mojm r   After the fall of the Empire in 907  the centre of power was transferred from Moravia to Bohemia  under the P emyslids  During the rule of P emyslid dukes kings and their successors  the Luxembourgs  the country reached its greatest territorial extent  13th 14th century   Life in the country was significantly affected by the Hussite wars  during which it faced economic embargo and crusades from all over Europe  Following the Battle of Moh cs in 1526  the Crown of Bohemia was gradually integrated into the Habsburg monarchy as one of its three principal parts alongside the Archduchy of Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary  The Bohemian Revolt  1618 20  led to the further centralization of the monarchy including forced recatholization and Germanization  During radical reforms in the 18th century the Bohemian Crown was even de facto abolished  1749   In the 19th century the Czech lands became the industrial powerhouse of the monarchy and the core of the Republic of Czechoslovakia which was formed in 1918  following the collapse of the Austro Hungarian empire after World War I  After the Munich Agreement  Polish annexation of Zaolzie and German occupation of Czechoslovakia and the consequent disillusion with the Western response and gratitude for the liberation of the major portion of Czechoslovakia by the Red Army  the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia won the majority in the 1946 elections  In a 1948 coup d  tat  Czechoslovakia became a communist ruled state  In 1968  the increasing dissatisfaction culminated in attempts to reform the communist regime  The events  known as the Prague Spring of 1968  ended with an invasion by the armies of the Warsaw Pact countries  with the exception of Romania   the troops remained in the country until the 1989 Velvet Revolution  when the communist regime collapsed  On 1 January 1993  Czechoslovakia peacefully dissolved into its constituent states  the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic  The Czech Republic is the first former member of the Comecon to achieve the status of a developed country according to the World Bank  8  In addition  the country has the highest human development in Central and Eastern Europe  9  ranking as a  Very High Human Development  nation  It is also ranked as the third most peaceful country in Europe 10  and most democratic and healthy  by infant mortality  country in the region  11  12  Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 2 1 Prehistory 2 2

11 External links  edit  Etymology Main article  Name of the Czech Republic The traditional English name  Bohemia  derives from Latin  Boiohaemum   which means  home of the Boii   The current name comes from the Czech endonym  echy using the antiquated spelling Czechy  identical to the Polish spelling  13  The country has been traditionally divided into lands  namely Bohemia proper   echy  in the west  Moravia  Morava  in the southeast  and Czech Silesia  Slezsko  the smaller  south eastern part of historical Silesia  most of which is located within modern Poland  in the northeast  Known officially as the  Crown of the Kingdom of Bohemia  since the 14th century  a number of other names of the country had been used  including the Lands of the Bohemian Crown  Czech Bohemian lands  Bohemian Crown  Lands of the Crown of Saint Wenceslas etc  When the country regained its independence after the dissolution of the Austro Hungarian empire in 1918  the new name of Czechoslovakia was coined to reflect the union of the Czech and Slovak nations within the new country  Following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia at the end of 1992  the Czech part of the former nation found itself without a common single word name in English  In 1993  the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs suggested the name Czechia   t  ki     esko Czech pronunciation    t  sk   in Czech  as an official alternative in all situations other than formal official documents and the full names of government institutions  however  this has not become widespread in English  even though most other languages have single word names for the country  usually their own variants of  Czechia     edit  History Main article  History of the Czech lands  edit  Prehistory Great Moravia during the reign of Svatopluk I Archaeologists have found evidence of prehistoric human settlements in the area  dating back to the Neolithic era  In the classical era  from the 3rd century BC Celtic migrations  the Boii and later in the 1st century  Germanic tribes of Marcomanni and Quadi settled there  During the Migration Period around the 5th century  many Germanic tribes moved westwards and southwards out of Central Europe  Wenceslaus II   the King of Bohemia and Poland Slavic people from the Black Sea Carpathian region settled in the area  a movement that was also stimulated by the onslaught of peoples from Siberia and Eastern Europe  Huns  Avars  Bulgars and Magyars   In the sixth century they moved southwards into Bohemia  Moravia and some of present day Austria  During the 7th century  the Frankish merchant Samo  supporting the Slavs fighting their Avar rulers  became the ruler of the first known Slav state in Central Europe  The Moravian principality arose in the 8th century   edit  Bohemia P emysl Ottokar II   c  1233 1278   King of Bohemia and ruler of Austria  Styria  Carinthia and Carniola The Bohemian or Czech state emerged in the late 9th century  when it was unified by the P emyslid dynasty  The Kingdom of Bohemia was  as the only kingdom in the Holy Roman Empire  a significant regional power during the Middle Ages  It was part of the Empire from 1002 till 1806  with the exception of years 1440 1526  In 1212  King P emysl Otakar I  bearing the title  king  since 1198  extracted a Golden Bull of Sicily  a formal edict  from the emperor  confirming the royal title for Otakar and his descendants and the Duchy of Bohemia was raised to a kingdom  The German immigration occurred in Bohemian periphery in 13th century  The Germans populated towns and mining districts and  in some cases  formed German colonies in the interior of the Czech lands  In 1235  the mighty Mongol army launched an invasion of Europe  After the Battle of Legnica  the Mongols carried their devastating raid into Moravia  but they were beaten by the Czech royal army in a battle of Olomouc and continued into Hungarian lands  14  King P emysl Otakar II earned the nickname  Iron and Golden King  because of his military power and wealth  He acquired Austria  Styria  Carinthia and Carniola  thus spreading the Bohemian territory to the Adriatic Sea  He met his death at the Battle on the Marchfeld in 1278 in a war with his rival  King Rudolph I of Germany  15  Ottokar s son Wenceslaus II acquired the Polish crown in 1300 for himself and the Hungarian crown for his son  He built a great empire stretching from the Danube river to the Baltic Sea  In 1306  the last king of P emyslid line was murdered in mysterious circumstances in Olomouc while he was resting  After a series of dynastic wars  the House of Luxembourg gained the Bohemian throne  16  Charles IV  1316 78  eleventh king of Bohemia  elected as the Nejv t    ech  Greatest Czech  of all time  17  The 14th century  particularly the reign of Czech King Charles IV  who became also King of Italy  King of the Romans and Holy Roman Emperor  is considered the Golden Age of Czech history  Of particular significance was the founding of Charles University in Prague in 1348  Charles Bridge  Charles Square and were completed much of the Prague Castle and cathedral of Saint Vitus  The Black Death  which had raged in Europe from 1347 to 1352  decimated the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1380  18  killing about 10  of the population  19  In the 15th century  the religious and social reformer Jan Hus formed a movement later named after him  Although Hus was named a heretic and burnt in Constanz in 1415  his followers seceded from the Catholic Church and in the Hussite Wars  1419 1434  defeated five crusades organized against them by the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund  Petr Chel ick  continued with Czech Hussite Reformation movement  During the next two centuries  90  of the inhabitants became adherents of the Hussite Christian movement  After 1526 Bohemia came increasingly under Habsburg control as the Habsburgs became first the elected and then the hereditary when   rulers of Bohemia  The Defenestration of Prague and subsequent revolt against the Habsburgs in 1618 marked the start of the Thirty Years  War  which quickly spread throughout Central Europe  In 1620  the rebellion in Bohemia was crushed at the Battle of White Mountain  and the ties between Bohemia and Habsburgs  hereditary lands in Austria were strengthened  The war had a devastating effect on the local population  the people were given the choice either to convert to Catholicism or leave the country  The following period  from 1620 to the late 18th century  has been often called the  Dark Age   The population of the Czech lands declined by a third through war  disease  famine and the expulsion of the Protestant Czechs  20  The Habsburgs banned all religions other than Catholicism  21 Ottoman Turks and Tatars invaded Moravia in 1663  22  In 1679 1680 the Czech lands faced a devastating plague and an uprising of serfs  23  The reigns of Maria Theresa of Austria and her son Joseph II  Holy Roman Emperor and co regent from 1765  were characterized by enlightened absolutism  In 1742  most of Silesia  then the possession of the Bohemian crown  was seized by King Frederick II of Prussia in the War of the Austrian Succession  The Great Famine  which lasted from 1770 until 1771  killed about one tenth of the Czech population  or 250 000 inhabitants  and radicalized countrysides leading to peasant uprisings  24  After the fall of the Holy Roman Empire  Bohemia became part of the Austrian Empire and later of Austria Hungary  Serfdom was not completely abolished until 1848  After the Revolutions of 1848  Emperor Franz Josef I of Austria instituted an absolute monarchy in an effort to balance competing ethnic interests in the empire  Czechoslovak troops in Vladivostok  Siberia  1918    edit  Czechoslovakia Main article  History of Czechoslovakia An estimated 1 4 million Czech soldiers fought in World War I  of them some 150 000 died  More than 90 000 Czech volunteers formed the Czechoslovak Legions in France  Italy and Russia  where they fought against the Central Powers and later against Bolshevik troops  25  Following the collapse of the Austro Hungarian Empire after World War I  the independent republic of Czechoslovakia was created in 1918  This new country incorporated the Bohemian Crown  Bohemia  Moravia and Silesia  and parts of the Kingdom of Hungary  Slovakia and the Carpathian Ruthenia  with significant German  Hungarian  Polish and Ruthenian speaking minorities  26  Tom   Garrigue Masaryk  first president of Czechoslovakia  Although Czechoslovakia was a unitary state  it provided what were at the time rather extensive rights to its minorities and remained the only democracy in this part of Europe in the interwar period  The effects of the Great Depression including high unemployment and massive propaganda from Nazi Germany  however  resulted in discontent and strong support among ethnic Germans for a break from Czechoslovakia  Adolf Hitler took advantage of this opportunity and  using Konrad Henlein s separatist Sudeten German Party  gained the largely German speaking Sudetenland  and its substantial Maginot Line like border fortifications  through the 1938 Munich Agreement  signed by Nazi Germany  France  Britain and Italy   despite the mobilization of 1 2 million strong Czechoslovak army and the Franco Czech military alliance  Poland annexed the Zaolzie area around  esk  T   n  Hungary gained parts of Slovakia and the Subcarpathian Rus as a result of the First Vienna Award in November 1938  The remainders of Slovakia and the Subcarpathian Rus gained greater autonomy  with the state renamed to  Czecho Slovakia   After Nazi Germany threatened to annex part of Slovakia  allowing the remaining regions to be partitioned by Hungary and Poland  Slovakia chose to maintain its national and territorial integrity  seceding from Czecho Slovakia in March 1939  and allying itself  as demanded by Germany  with Hitler s coalition  27  The remaining Czech territory was occupied by Germany  which transformed it into the so called Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia  The protectorate was proclaimed part of the Third Reich  and the president and prime minister were subordinate to the Nazi Germany s Reichsprotektor   imperial protector    Subcarpathian Rus declared independence as the Republic of Carpatho Ukraine on 15 March 1939 but was invaded by Hungary the same day and formally annexed the next day  Approximately 345 000 Czechoslovak citizens  including 277 000 Jews  were killed or executed while hundreds of thousands of others were sent to prisons and concentration camps or used as forced labour  Perhaps two thirds of the Czech nation was destined either for extermination or removal  28  A Nazi German concentration camp existed at Terez n  north of Prague  A memorial to 82 Lidice children murdered by the Nazi Germans in Chelmno  There was Czech resistance to Nazi occupation  both at home and abroad  most notably with the assassination of Nazi German leader Reinhard Heydrich in a Prague suburb on 27 May 1942  The Czechoslovak government in exile and its army fighting against the Germans were acknowledged by the Allies  Czech Czechoslovak troops fought from the very beginning of the war in Poland  France  the UK  North Africa  the Middle East and the Soviet Union  The German occupation ended on 9 May 1945  with the arrival of the Soviet and American armies and the Prague uprising  An estimated 140 000 Soviet soldiers died in conquering Czechoslovakia from German rule  29  In 1945 1946  almost the entire German minority in Czechoslovakia  about 3 million people  were expelled to Germany and Austria  During this time  thousands of Germans were held in prisons and detention camps or used as forced labour  In the summer of 1945  there were several massacres  The only Germans not expelled were some 250 000 who had been active in the resistance against the Nazi Germans or were considered economically important  though many of these emigrated later  Following a Soviet organised referendum  the Subcarpathian Rus never returned under Czechoslovak rule but became part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic  as the Zakarpattia Oblast in 1946  Czechoslovakia uneasily tried to play the role of a  bridge  between the West and East  However  the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia rapidly increased in popularity  with a general disillusionment with the West  because of the pre war Munich Agreement  and a favourable popular attitude towards the Soviet Union  because of the Soviets  role in liberating Czechoslovakia from German rule  In the 1946 elections  the Communists gained 38  30  of the votes and became the largest party in the Czechoslovak parliament  They formed a coalition government with other parties of the National Front and moved quickly to consolidate power  The decisive step took place in February 1948  during a series of events characterized by Communists as a  revolution  and by anti Communists as a  takeover   the Communist People s Militias secured control of key locations in Prague  and a new all Communist government was formed  For the next 41 years  Czechoslovakia was a Communist state within the Eastern Bloc  This period is characterized by lagging behind the West in almost every aspect of social and economic development  The country s GDP per capita fell from the level of neighboring Austria below that of Greece or Portugal in the 1980s  The Communist government completely nationalized the means of production and established a command economy  The economy grew rapidly during the 1950s but slowed down in the 1960s and 1970s and stagnated in the 1980s  The political climate was highly repressive during the 1950s  including numerous show trials and hundreds of thousands of political prisoners  but became more open and tolerant in the late 1960s  culminating in Alexander Dub ek s leadership in the 1968 Prague Spring  which tried to create  socialism with a human face  and perhaps even introduce political pluralism  This was forcibly ended by 21 August 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion  The Czech Republic became a member of the European Union in 2004  signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007 and ratified it in 2009 as the last EU member  The invasion was followed by a harsh program of  Normalization  in the late 1960s and the 1970s  Until 1989  the political establishment relied on censorship of the opposition  Dissidents published Charter 77 in 1977  and the first of a new wave of protests were seen in 1988  Between 1948 and 1989 more than 250 000 Czechs and Slovaks were sent to prison for  anti state activities  and over 400 000 emigrated  31   edit  Velvet revolution and independence Non violent protesters face armed policemen In November 1989  Czechoslovakia returned to a liberal democracy through the peaceful  Velvet Revolution   However  Slovak national aspirations strengthened and on 1 January 1993  the country peacefully split into the independent Czech Republic and Slovakia  Both countries went through economic reforms and privatisations  with the intention of creating a capitalist economy  This process was largely successful  in 2006 the Czech Republic was recognised by the World Bank as a  developed country   8  and in 2009 the Human Development Index ranked it as a nation of  Very High Human Development   9  From 1991  the Czech Republic  originally as part of Czechoslovakia and now in its own right  has been a member of the Visegr d Group and from 1995  the

The members of the Senate are elected in single seat constituencies by two round runoff voting for a six year term  with one third elected every even year in the autumn  The first election was in 1996  for differing terms  This arrangement is modeled on the U S  Senate  but each constituency is roughly the same size and the voting system used is a two round runoff  The Senate is unpopular among the

precipitation increases  The wettest area in the Czech Republic is found around B l  Potok in Jizera Mountains and the driest region is the Louny District to the northwest of Prague  Another important
