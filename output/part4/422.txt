Jamaican passport official would later swap his first and middle names  8  His father  Norval Sinclair Marley  was a white Jamaican of mixed and English descent whose family came from Essex  England  Norval was a captain in the Royal Marines  as well as a plantation overseer  when he married Cedella Booker  an Afro Jamaican then 18 years old  9  Norval provided financial support for his wife and child  but seldom saw them  as he was often away on trips  In 1955  when Bob Marley was 10 years old  his father died of a heart attack at age 70  10  Marley faced questions about his own racial identity throughout his life  He once reflected  I don t have prejudice against meself  My father was a white and my mother was black  Them call me half caste or whatever  Me don t dip on nobody s side  Me don t dip on the black man s side nor the white man s side  Me dip on God s side  the one who create me and cause me to come from black and white  11  The Bob Marley House in Nine Mile is a home that he shared with his mother during his youth Although Marley recognised his mixed ancestry  throughout his life and because of his beliefs  he self identified as a black African  following the ideas of Pan African leaders  Marley stated that his two biggest influences were the African centered Marcus Garvey and Haile Selassie  A central theme in Bob Marley s message was the repatriation of black people to Zion  which in his view was Ethiopia  or more generally  Africa  12  In songs such as  Black Survivor    Babylon System   and  Blackman Redemption   Marley sings about the struggles of blacks and Africans against oppression from the West or  Babylon   13  Marley became friends with Neville  Bunny  Livingston  later known as Bunny Wailer   with whom he started to play music  He left school at the age of 14 to make music with Joe Higgs  a local singer and devout Rastafari  At a jam session with Higgs and Livingston  Marley met Peter McIntosh  later known as Peter Tosh   who had similar musical ambitions  14  In 1962  Marley recorded his first two singles   Judge Not  and  One Cup of Coffee   with local music producer Leslie Kong  These songs  released on the Beverley s label under the pseudonym of Bobby Martell  15  attracted little attention  The songs were later re released on the box set Songs of Freedom  a posthumous collection of Marley s work  Marley was also known to use an Epiphone guitar for much of his career  Bob Marley Epiphone guitar at his birthplace in Nine Mile  Jamaica  Bob Marley  amp  The Wailers Main article  Bob Marley  amp  The Wailers 1963 1974 Marley in concert in 1980  Zurich  Switzerland In 1963  Bob Marley  Bunny Wailer  Peter Tosh  Junior Braithwaite  Beverley Kelso  and Cherry Smith formed a ska and rocksteady group  calling themselves  The Teenagers   They later changed their name to  The Wailing Rudeboys   then to  The Wailing Wailers   at which point they were discovered by record producer Coxsone Dodd  and finally to  The Wailers   By 1966  Braithwaite  Kelso  and Smith had left The Wailers  leaving the core trio of Bob Marley  Bunny Wailer  and Peter Tosh  16  In 1966  Marley married Rita Anderson  and moved near his mother s residence in Wilmington  Delaware in the United States for a short time  during which he worked as a DuPont lab assistant and on the assembly line at a Chrysler plant  under the alias Donald Marley  17  Though raised in the Catholic tradition  Marley became captivated by Rastafarian beliefs in the 1960s  when away from his mother s influence  18  Formally converted to Rastafari after returning to Jamaica  Marley began to wear his trademark dreadlocks  see the religion section for more on Marley s religious views   After a conflict with Dodd  Marley and his band teamed up with Lee  Scratch  Perry and his studio band  The Upsetters  Although the alliance lasted less than a year  they recorded what many consider The Wailers  finest work  Marley and Perry split after a dispute regarding the assignment of recording rights  but they would remain friends and work together again  Bob Marley s flat in 1972 at 34 Ridgmount Gardens  Bloomsbury  London  his first UK address  19  20  Between 1968 and 1972  Bob and Rita Marley  Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer re cut some old tracks with JAD Records in Kingston and London in an attempt to commercialise The Wailers  sound  Bunny later asserted that these songs  should never be released on an album     they were just demos for record companies to listen to   Also in 1968  Bob and Rita visited the Bronx to see Johnny Nash s songwriter Jimmy Norman  21  A three day jam session with Norman and others  including Norman s co writer Al Pyfrom  resulted in a 24 minute tape of Marley performing several of his own and Norman Pyfrom s compositions  This tape is  according to Reggae archivist Roger Steffens  rare in that it was influenced by pop rather than reggae  as part of an effort to break Marley into the American charts  21  According to an article in The New York Times  Marley experimented on the tape with different sounds  adopting a doo wop style on  Stay With Me  and  the slow love song style of 1960 s artists  on  Splish for My Splash   21  An artist yet to establish himself outside his native Jamaica  Marley lived in Ridgmount Gardens  Bloomsbury  London during 1972  19  20  In 1972  the Wailers entered into an ill fated deal with CBS Records and embarked on a tour with American soul singer Johnny Nash  Broke  the Wailers became stranded in London  Marley turned up at Island Records founder and producer Chris Blackwell s London office  and asked him to advance the cost of a new single  Since Jimmy Cliff  Island s top reggae star  had recently left the label  Blackwell was primed for a replacement  In Marley  Blackwell recognized the elements needed to snare the rock audience   I was dealing with rock music  which was really rebel music  I felt that would really be the way to break Jamaican music  But you needed someone who could be that image  When Bob walked in he really was that image   22  Blackwell told Marley he wanted The Wailers to record a complete album  essentially unheard of at the time   When Marley told him it would take between  3 000 and  4 000  Blackwell trusted him with the greater sum  Despite their  rude boy  reputation  the Wailers returned to Kingston and honored the deal  delivering the album Catch A Fire  Primarily recorded on eight track at Harry J s in Kingston  Catch A Fire marked the first time a reggae band had access to a state of the art studio and were accorded the same care as their rock n roll peers  22  Blackwell desired to create  more of a drifting  hypnotic type feel than a reggae rhythm   23  and restructured Marley s mixes and arrangements  Marley travelled to London to supervise Blackwell s overdubbing of the album  which included tempering the mix from the bass heavy sound of Jamaican music  and omitting two tracks  22  The Wailers  first major label album  Catch a Fire was released worldwide in April 1973  packaged like a rock record with a unique Zippo lighter lift top  Initially selling 14 000 units  it didn t make Marley a star  but received a positive critical reception  22  It was followed later that year by Burnin   which included the standout songs  Get Up  Stand Up   and  I Shot the Sheriff   which appealed to the ear of Eric Clapton  He recorded a cover of the track in 1974 which became a huge American hit  raising Marley s international profile  24  Many Jamaicans were not keen on the new  improved  reggae sound on Catch A Fire  but the Trenchtown style of Burnin  found fans across both reggae and rock audiences  22  During this period  Blackwell gifted his Kingston residence and company headquarters at 56 Hope Road  then known as Island House  to Marley  Housing Tuff Gong Studios  the property became not only Marley s office  but also his home  22  The Wailers were scheduled to open 17 shows for the number one black act in the States  Sly and the Family Stone  After 4 shows  the band was fired because they were more popular than the acts they were opening for  25  The Wailers broke up in 1974 with each of the three main members pursuing solo careers  The reason for the breakup is shrouded in conjecture  some believe that there were disagreements amongst Bunny  Peter  and Bob concerning performances  while others claim that Bunny and Peter simply preferred solo work  1974 1981 Bob Marley  amp  The Wailers live at Crystal Palace Park during the Uprising Tour Despite the break up  Marley continued recording as  Bob Marley  amp  The Wailers   His new backing band included brothers Carlton and Aston  Family Man  Barrett on drums and bass respectively  Junior Marvin and Al Anderson on lead guitar  Tyrone Downie and Earl  Wya  Lindo on keyboards  and Alvin  Seeco  Patterson on percussion  The  I Threes   consisting of Judy Mowatt  Marcia Griffiths  and Marley s wife  Rita  provided backing vocals  In 1975  Marley had his international breakthrough with his first hit outside Jamaica   No Woman  No Cry   from the Natty Dread album  This was followed by his breakthrough album in the United States  Rastaman Vibration  1976   which spent four weeks on the Billboard Hot 100  26  On 3 December 1976  two days before  Smile Jamaica   a free concert organised by the Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley in an attempt to ease tension between two warring political groups  Marley  his wife  and manager Don Taylor were wounded in an assault by unknown gunmen inside Marley s home  Taylor and Marley s wife sustained serious injuries  but later made full recoveries  Bob Marley received minor wounds in the chest and arm  27  The shooting was thought to have been politically motivated  as many felt the concert was really a support rally for Manley  Nonetheless  the concert proceeded  and an injured Marley performed as scheduled  two days after the attempt  When asked why  Marley responded   The people who are trying to make this world worse aren t taking a day off  How can I   The members of the group Zap Pow  which had no radical religious or political beliefs  played as Bob Marley s backup band before a festival crowd of 80 000 while members of The Wailers were still missing or in hiding  28  29  Marley left Jamaica at the end of 1976  and after a month long  recovery and writing  sojourn at the site of Chris Blackwell s Compass Point Studios in Nassau  Bahamas  arrived in England  where he spent two years in self imposed exile  Whilst there he recorded the albums Exodus and Kaya  Exodus stayed on the British album charts for 56 consecutive weeks  It included four UK hit singles   Exodus    Waiting in Vain    Jamming   and  One Love   a rendition of Curtis Mayfield s hit   People Get Ready    During his time in London  he was arrested and received a conviction for possession of a small quantity of cannabis  30  In 1978  Marley returned to Jamaica and performed at another political concert  the One Love Peace Concert  again in an effort to calm warring parties  Near the end of the performance  by Marley s request  Michael Manley  leader of then ruling People s National Party  and his political rival Edward Seaga  leader of the opposing Jamaica Labour Party   joined each other on stage and shook hands  31  Under the name Bob Marley and the Wailers eleven albums were released  four live albums and seven studio albums  The releases included Babylon by Bus  a double live album with thirteen tracks  were released in 1978 and received critical acclaim  This album  and specifically the final track  Jamming  with the audience in a frenzy  captured the intensity of Marley s live performances  32   Marley wasn t singing about how peace could come easily to the World but rather how hell on Earth comes too easily to too many  His songs were his memories  he had lived with the wretched  he had seen the downpressers and those whom they pressed down      Mikal Gilmore  Rolling Stone Magazine 33  Survival  a defiant and politically charged album  was released in 1979  Tracks such as  Zimbabwe    Africa Unite    Wake Up and Live   and  Survival  reflected Marley s support for the struggles of Africans  His appearance at the Amandla Festival in Boston in July 1979 showed his strong opposition to South African apartheid  which he already had shown in his song  War  in 1976  In early 1980  he was invited to perform at the 17 April celebration of Zimbabwe s Independence Day  Uprising  1980  was Bob Marley s final studio album  and is one of his most religious productions  it includes  Redemption Song  and  Forever Loving Jah   34 Confrontation  released posthumously in 1983  contained

Rastafari articles This box  view talk edit Bob Marley was a member of the Rastafari movement  whose culture was a key element in the development of reggae  Bob Marley became an ardent proponent of Rastafari  taking their music out of the socially deprived areas of Jamaica and onto the international music scene  He once gave the following response  which was typical  to a question put to him during a recorded interview  Interviewer   Can you tell the people what it means being a Rastafarian   Bob   I would say to the people  Be still  and know that His Imperial Majesty  Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia is the Almighty  Now  the Bible seh so  Babylon newspaper seh so  and I and I the children seh so  Yunno  So I don t see how much more reveal our people want  Wha  dem want  a white God  well God come black  True true   36  Observant of the Rastafari practice Ital  a diet that shuns meat  Marley was a vegetarian  37  According to his biographers  he affiliated with the Twelve Tribes Mansion  He was in the denomination known as  Tribe of Joseph   because he was born in February  each of the twelve sects being composed of members born in a different month   He signified this in his album liner notes  quoting the portion from Genesis that includes Jacob s blessing to his son Joseph  Marley was baptised by the Archbishop of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church in Kingston  Jamaica  on 4 November 1980  38  39  Family Bob Marley had a number of children  three with his wife Rita  two adopted from Rita s previous relationships  and several others with different women  The Bob Marley official website acknowledges eleven children  Those listed on the official site are  Sharon  born 23 November 1964  to Rita in previous relationship Cedella born 23 August 1967  to Rita David  Ziggy   born 17 October 1968  to Rita Stephen  born 20 April 1972  to Rita Robert  Robbie   born 16 May 1972  to Pat Williams Rohan  born 19 May 1972  to Janet Hunt Karen  born 1973 to Janet Bowen Stephanie  born 17 August 1974  according to Cedella Booker she was the daughter of Rita and a man called Ital with whom Rita had an affair  nonetheless she was acknowledged as Bob s daughter Julian  born 4 June 1975  to Lucy Pounder Ky Mani  born 26 February 1976  to Anita Belnavis Damian  born 21 July 1978  to Cindy Breakspeare Makeda was born on 30 May 1981  to Yvette Crichton  after Marley s death  40  Meredith Dixon s book lists her as Marley s child  but she is not listed as such on the Bob Marley official website  Various websites  for example  41  also list Imani Carole  born 22 May 1963 to Cheryl Murray  but she does not appear on the official Bob Marley website  40  Final years and death Marley performing in Dalymount Park in the late 1970s In July 1977  Marley was found to have a type of malignant melanoma under the nail of one of his toes  Contrary to urban legend  this lesion was not primarily caused by an injury during a football match in that year  but was instead a symptom of the already existing cancer  Marley turned down doctors  advice to have his toe amputated  citing his religious beliefs  42  Despite his illness  he continued touring and was in the process of scheduling a world tour in 1980  The intention was for Inner Circle to be his opening act on the tour but after their lead singer Jacob Miller died in Jamaica in March 1980 after returning from a scouting mission in Brazil this was no longer mentioned  43  The album Uprising was released in May 1980  produced by Chris Blackwell   on which  Redemption Song  is particularly considered to be about Marley coming to terms with his mortality  citation needed  The band completed a major tour of Europe  where they played their biggest concert  to a hundred thousand people in Milan  After the tour Marley went to America  where he performed two shows at Madison Square Garden as part of the Uprising Tour  The final concert of Bob Marley s career was held 23 September 1980 at the Stanley Theater  now called The Benedum Center For The Performing Arts  in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  The audio recording of that concert is now available on CD  vinyl  and digital music services  Shortly after  Marley s health deteriorated and he became very ill  the cancer had spread throughout his body  The rest of the tour was cancelled and Marley sought treatment at the Bavarian clinic of Josef Issels  where he received a controversial type of cancer therapy  Issels treatment  partly based on avoidance of certain foods  drinks  and other substances  After fighting the cancer without success for eight months  Marley boarded a plane for his home in Jamaica  44  While flying home from Germany to Jamaica  Marley s vital functions worsened  After landing in Miami  Florida  he was taken to the hospital for immediate medical attention  He died at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Miami  now University of Miami Hospital  on the morning of 11 May 1981  at the age of 36  The spread of melanoma to his lungs and brain caused his death  His final words to his son Ziggy were  Money can t buy life   45  Marley received a state funeral in Jamaica on 21 May 1981  which combined elements of Ethiopian Orthodoxy and Rastafari tradition  46  He was buried in a chapel near his birthplace with his red Gibson Les Paul  some accounts say it was a Fender Stratocaster   47  On 21 May 1981  Jamaican Prime Minister Edward Seaga delivered the final funeral eulogy to Marley  declaring  His voice was an omnipresent cry in our electronic world  His sharp features  majestic looks  and prancing style a vivid etching on the landscape of our minds  Bob Marley was never seen  He was an experience which left an indelible imprint with each encounter  Such a man cannot be erased from the mind  He is part of the collective consciousness of the nation  48  Legacy Marley has remained popular for decades after his death one of many memorials to him is this representation at Madame Tussaud Wax Museum in Amsterdam Bob Marley was the Third World s first pop superstar  He was the man who introduced the world to the mystic power of reggae  He was a true rocker at heart  and as a songwriter  he brought the lyrical force of Bob Dylan  the personal charisma of John Lennon  and the essential vocal stylings of Smokey Robinson into one voice    Jann Wenner  at Marley s 1994 posthumous introduction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 49  In 1999 Time magazine chose Bob Marley  amp  The Wailers  Exodus as the greatest album of the 20th century  50  In 2001  he was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award  and a feature length documentary about his life  Rebel Music  won various awards at the Grammys  With contributions from Rita  The Wailers  and Marley s lovers and children  it also tells much of the story in his own words  51  A statue was inaugurated  next to the national stadium on Arthur Wint Drive in Kingston to commemorate him  In 2006  the State of New York renamed a portion of Church Avenue from Remsen Avenue to East 98th Street in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn  Bob Marley Boulevard   52  In 2008  a statue of Marley was inaugurated in Banatski Sokolac  Serbia  53  Internationally  Marley s message also continues to reverberate amongst various indigenous communities  For instance  the Aboriginal people of Australia continue to burn a sacred flame to honor his memory in Sydney s Victoria Park  while members of the Native American Hopi and Havasupai tribe revere his work  54  There are also many tributes to Bob Marley throughout India  including restaurants  hotels  and cultural festivals  55  56  Marley has also evolved into a global symbol  which has been endlessly merchandised through a variety of mediums  In light of this  author Dave Thompson in his book Reggae and Caribbean Music  laments what he perceives to be the commercialized pacification of Marley s more militant edge  stating  Bob Marley ranks among both the most popular and the most misunderstood figures in modern culture     That the machine has utterly emasculated Marley is beyond doubt  Gone from the public record is the ghetto kid who dreamed of Che Guevara and the Black Panthers  and pinned their posters up in the Wailers Soul Shack record store  who believed in freedom  and the fighting which it necessitated  and dressed the part on an early album sleeve  whose heroes were James Brown and Muhammad Ali  whose God was Ras Tafari and whose sacrament was marijuana  Instead  the Bob Marley who surveys his kingdom today is smiling benevolence  a shining sun  a waving palm tree  and a string of hits which tumble out of polite radio like candy from a gumball machine  Of course it has assured his immortality  But it has also demeaned him beyond recognition  Bob Marley was worth far more  57  Film adaptations In February 2008  director Martin Scorsese announced his intention to produce a documentary movie on Marley  The film was set to be released on 6 February 2010  on what would have been Marley s 65th birthday  58  However  Scorsese dropped out due to scheduling problems  He was replaced by Jonathan Demme  59  who dropped out due to creative differences with producer Steve Bing during the beginning of editing  Kevin Macdonald replaced Demme 60  and the film was released in 2012  In March 2008  The Weinstein Company announced its plans to produce a biopic of Bob Marley  based on the book No Woman No Cry  My Life With Bob Marley by Rita Marley  Rudy Langlais will produce the script by Lizzie Borden and Rita Marley will be executive producer  61  Discography Main article  Bob Marley  amp  The Wailers discography The Wailing Wailers  1965  The Best of The Wailers  1970  Soul Rebels  1970  Soul
