region in Switzerland  Wallonia and Brussels in Belgium  Monaco  the province of Quebec and the Acadia region in Canada  and by various communities elsewhere  Second language speakers of French are distributed throughout many parts of the world  the largest numbers of which reside in Francophone Africa  5  In Africa  French is most commonly spoken in Gabon  where 80  report fluency  5 Mauritius  78    Algeria  75    Senegal and C te d Ivoire  70    French is estimated as having between 70 million 6  and 110 million 7  native speakers and 190 million second language speakers  3  French is the second most studied foreign language in the world  after English  8  9  French is a distortion of the spoken Latin language of the Roman Empire  as are languages such as Italian  Portuguese  Spanish  Romanian  Sardinian and Catalan  Its closest relatives are the other langues d o l  languages historically spoken in northern France and Belgium which have largely been supplanted by French today  The development of French was also influenced by the native Celtic languages of Roman Gaul and by the  Germanic  Frankish language of the post Roman Frankish invaders  Today  owing to France s past overseas expansion  there are numerous French based creole languages  most notably Haitian Creole  It is an official language in 29 countries  most of which form what is called  in French  la francophonie  the community of French speaking countries  It is an official language of all United Nations agencies and a large number of international organizations  According to the European Union  129 million  or twenty six percent of the Union s total population  speak French  of whom 72 million are native speakers  65 million in France  4 5 million in Belgium  plus 2 5 million in Switzerland which is not part of the EU  and 69 million are second language or foreign language speakers  thus making French the third language in the European Union that people state they are most able to speak  after English and German  Twenty percent of non Francophone Europeans know how to speak French  totaling roughly 145 6 million people in Europe alone  10  George Weber  author of  Top Languages  The World s 10 most influential Languages   wrote that until the end of the nineteenth century  French had a global dominance similar to that now occupied by English  He said  nobody could pass for educated without the ability to speak French  and  However  French dominance was never so complete as its rival s is now for the simple reason that 100 years ago large parts of the world were not yet connected to rest as they are all today  In Mongolia it was sufficient to speak Mongolian  in Madagascar Malagasy could get you anywhere  Globalization had not been heard of then   3  As a result of extensive colonial ambitions of France and Belgium  at that time governed by a French speaking elite   between the 17th and 20th centuries  French was introduced to the Americas  Africa  Polynesia  the Levant  Southeast Asia  and the Caribbean  According to a demographic projection led by the Universit  Laval and the R seau D mographie de l Agence universitaire de la francophonie  French will be represented by approximately 500 million people in 2025 and by 650 million people  or approximately seven percent of the world s population in 2050  11  12  Contents 1 Geographic distribution 1 1

According to the Constitution of France  French has been the official language since 1992 15   although previous legal texts have made it official since 1539  see ordinance of Villers Cotter ts   France mandates the use of French in official government publications  public education except in specific cases  though these dispositions are often ignored  and legal contracts  advertisements must bear a translation of foreign words  In addition to French  there are also a variety of regional languages and dialects  France has signed the European Charter for Regional Languages  but has not ratified it since that would go against its 1958 Constitution  16   edit  Switzerland Further information  Languages of Switzerland  Swiss French  and Romandie French is one of the four official languages of Switzerland  along with German  Italian and Romansh  and is spoken in the western part of Switzerland called Romandie  of which Geneva is the largest city  The language divisions in Switzerland do not coincide with political subdivisions and some cantons have bilingual status for example  cities such Biel Bienne or cantons such as Valais Fribourg Berne  French is the native language of about 20  of the Swiss population and is spoken by 50 4  17  of the population  Most of Swiss French is mutually compatible with the standard French spoken in France  but it is often used with small differences  such as those involving numbers after 69 and slight differences in other vocabulary terms   edit  Belgium Further information  Languages of Belgium and Belgian French Bilingual signs in Brussels  In Belgium  French is the official language of Wallonia  excluding a part of the East Cantons  which are German speaking  and one of the two official languages along with Dutch of the Brussels Capital Region  where it is spoken by the majority of the population  though often not as their primary language  18  French and German are not official languages nor recognized minority languages in the Flemish Region  although along borders with the Walloon and Brussels Capital regions  there are a dozen municipalities with language facilities for French speakers  A mirror situation exists for the Walloon Region with respect to the Dutch and German languages  In total  native French speakers make up about 40  of the country s population  while the remaining 60  speak Dutch as a first language  Of the latter  59  claim French as a second or third language  meaning that about three quarters of the Belgian population can speak French  19  20   edit  Monaco and Andorra Further information  Languages of Monaco and Languages of Andorra Although Mon gasque is the national language of the Principality of Monaco  French is the only official language  and French nationals make up some 47  of the population  Catalan is the only official language of Andorra  however  French is commonly used because of the proximity to France and the fact that France is  with the Urgel s Bishop  part of the government  French nationals make up 7  of the population  Knowledge of French in the European Union and candidate countries 21   Note that around 40  of Belgium s population are native French speakers  22  totaling 88  23  of the country s population    edit  Luxembourg Further information  Languages of Luxembourg and Multilingualism in Luxembourg French is one of three official languages of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg  alongside German and Luxembourgish  the natively spoken language of Luxembourg  French is primarily used for administrative purposes by the government  and is also the language used to converse with foreigners  24  Luxembourg s education system is trilingual  the first years of primary school are in Luxembourgish  before changing to German  while in secondary school  the language of instruction changes to French  24   edit  Italy Further information  Languages of Italy French is also an official language in the small region of Aosta Valley  Italy  25  Though most non Italophone people in the region speak Franco Proven al  26  they use standard French to write  That is because the international recognition of Franco Proven al as a separate language  as opposed to a dialect or patois of French  was quite recent   edit  The United Kingdom and the Channel Islands Further information  Languages of Jersey  Languages of Guernsey  and Languages of the United Kingdom French is a large minority language and immigrant language in the United Kingdom  with over 300 000 French born people in the UK  It is also the most popular foreign language  French is spoken and understood by 23  of the UK population  27  Modern and Middle English reflect a mixture of O l and Old English lexicons after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066  when a Norman speaking aristocracy took control of a population whose mother tongue was Germanic in origin  As a result of the intertwined histories of England and continental possessions of the English Crown  many formal and legal words from Modern English have French roots  Thus whilst words such as buy and sell are of Germanic origin  purchase and vend are from Old French  French is an official language in both Jersey and Guernsey  Both use French to some degree  mostly in an administrative or ceremonial capacity  Jersey Legal French is the standardized variety used in Jersey  However  Norman  in its local forms  Guern siais and J rriais  is the historical vernacular of the islands   edit  North and South America  edit  Canada See also  Canadian French  French language in

is the sole official language in the province of Quebec  being the mother tongue for some 7 million people  or almost 80 1   2006 Census  of the Province  About 95 0  of the people of Quebec speak French as either their first or second language  and for some as their third language  Quebec is also home to the city of Montreal  which is the world s second largest French speaking city  by number of first language speakers  New Brunswick  where about a third of the population is francophone  is the only officially bilingual province  Portions of Eastern Ontario  Northeastern Ontario  Nova Scotia  Newfoundland and Labrador  Alberta and Manitoba have sizable French minorities  and many provinces provide service in French for its linguistic minorities  Smaller pockets of French speakers exist in all other provinces  About 9 487 500 of Canadians speak French as their first language  or around 30  of the country  28  29  with 2 065 300 constituting secondary speakers  30  Due to the increased bilingual school programs and French Immersion Classes in English Canada  the portion of Canadians proficient in French has risen significantly in the past two decades  and is still rising  The difference between French spoken in Quebec and French spoken in France is similar in degree to that between American and British English  In Quebec  where the majority of French speaking Canadians live  the Office qu b cois de la langue fran aise  English  Quebec Board of the French language  regulates Quebec French and ensures the Charter of the French Language  Bill 101  amp  104  is respected  The Office qu b cois de la langue fran aise determined that  stop  is a valid French word  however  it is observed that stop signs reading  ARR T  predominate in French speaking areas  and  STOP  can be found in majority English speaking areas   edit  Haiti French is one of Haiti s two official languages  It is the principal language of writing  school instruction  and administrative use  It is spoken by all educated Haitians and is used in the business sector  It is also used in ceremonial events such as weddings  graduations and church masses  About 10 15  of the country s population have French as their first language  the rest speak it as a secondary language in varying degrees of proficiency from basic level to fluent  The second official language is the recently standardized Haitian Creole which is spoken by virtually the entire population of Haiti  Haitian Creole is one of the French based creole languages  drawing the large majority of its vocabulary from French  with influences from West African languages  as well as several European languages  Haitian Creole is closely related to Louisiana Creole and all other French creoles   edit  French overseas

home to many distinct dialects  collectively known as Louisiana French  Cajun French has the largest number of speakers  mostly living in Acadiana  According to the 2000 United States Census  there are over 194 000 people in Louisiana who speak French at home  the most of any state if Creole French is excluded  32 New England French  essentially a variant of Canadian French  is spoken in parts of New England  Missouri French was historically spoken in Missouri and Illinois  formerly known as Upper Louisiana   but is nearly extinct today  33   edit  Brazil The French language was spoken in Brazil for a brief period during the colonial attempts of France Antarctique and France Ecquinociale  Also  the language was used by the community of French immigrants and expatriates in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries  and by the Brazilian public education system  Today the Karipuna indigenous community  nearly 30 000 people  of Amap  in North Brazil speaks a French creole  the Lanc Patu   possibly related to the French Guiana Creole   edit  Africa Main articles  African French and Maghreb French Supermarket sign in French in Dakar  Senegal    Countries usually considered as Francophone Africa  These countries had a population of 349 million in 2011  34  Their population is projected to reach between 710 million 35  and 729 million 34  in 2050    Countries sometimes considered as Francophone Africa   Countries that are not Francophone but are Members or Observers of the OIF A majority of the world s French speaking population lives in Africa  According to the 2007 report by the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie  an estimated 115 million African people spread across 31 Francophone African countries can speak French as either a first or a second language  5  This number does not include the people living in non Francophone African countries who have learned French as a foreign language  5  Due to the rise of French in Africa  the total French speaking population is expected to reach 700 million people in 2050  36  French is mostly a second language in Africa  but it has become a first language in some areas  such as the region of Abidjan  C te d Ivoire 37  and in Libreville  Gabon  38  The classification of French as a second language in Francophone Africa is debatable because it is often the only language spoken and written in schools  administrations  radio  TV and the Internet  This prevalence of French is noticeable in popular music  in which French is often mixed with the language of the song  It is not possible to speak of a single form of African French  but rather of diverse forms of African French which have developed because of the contact with many indigenous African languages  39  In fact  the term African French is a misnomer  as forms are different from country to country  and the root of the French spoken in a particular country depends on its former colonial empire  French spoken in the Benin  for example  is closer to that spoken in France than to French spoken in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  which is rooted in Belgian French  In the territories of the Indian Ocean  the French language is often spoken alongside French derived creole languages  the major exception being Madagascar  There  a Malayo Polynesian language  Malagasy  is spoken alongside French  Sub Saharan Africa is the region where the French language is most likely to expand  because of the expansion of education and rapid demographic growth  40  It is also where the language has evolved the most in recent years  41  42  Some vernacular forms of French in Africa can be difficult to understand for French speakers from other countries  43  but written forms of the language are very closely related to those of the rest of the French speaking world  French is an official language in many African countries  most of them former French or Belgian colonies   Benin  Burkina Faso  Burundi  Cameroon  Central African Republic  Chad  Comoros  Congo  Republic of the  C te d Ivoire  Democratic Republic of the Congo  Djibouti  Equatorial Guinea  former colony of Spain   Gabon  Guinea  Madagascar  Mali  Niger  Rwanda

Algeria   Mauritania  see also languages of Mauritania   Morocco  see also languages of Morocco   Tunisia  see also languages of Tunisia   edit  Algeria Most urban Algerians have some working knowledge of French  and a high  though unknown  percentage speak it fluently  However  because of the country s colonial past  the predominance of French has long been politically fraught  Numerous reforms have been implemented in recent decades to improve the status of Arabic in relation to French  especially in education  For this reason  although Algeria is certainly one of the most Francophone countries in the world outside of France  and has perhaps the largest number of French speakers  it does not participate in the Francophonie association   edit  Egypt Bilingual Arabic

purposes  and is taught in many schools as a secondary language along with Arabic and English  See further languages of Lebanon  As in Lebanon  French was official in Syria until 1943  In contrast to the situation in Lebanon  the French language is less used  but it is still spoken to some degree by educated groups  both in the  lite and in the middle class  See further languages of Syria  There are also a significant number of native and second language French speakers in Israel who trace their origins to the francocized Jewish communities of North Africa   see Maghrebi Jews  and Romania

administrative language in Laos and Cambodia  although its influence has waned in recent years  44  In colonial Vietnam  the elites spoke French  and many who worked for the French spoke a French creole known as  T y B i   now extinct   However  French has been effectively displaced as the main foreign language of choice by English in recent years  The language was also spoken by the elite in

article  French phonology This article contains IPA phonetic symbols  Without proper rendering support  you may see question marks  boxes  or other symbols instead of Unicode characters  Although there are many French regional accents  foreign learners normally study only one version of the language  which has no commonly used special name  There are 16 vowels in French  not all of which are used in every dialect   a         e              i    o         y    u             plus the nasalized vowels                  and       In France  the vowels     and      are tending to be replaced by  a  and      in many people s speech  Voiced stops  i e   b d     are typically produced fully voiced throughout  Voiceless stops  i e   p t k   are unaspirated  Nasals  The velar nasal     can occur in final position in borrowed  usually English  words  parking  camping  swing  The palatal nasal     can occur in word initial position  e g  gnon   but it is most frequently found in intervocalic  onset position or word finally  e g  montagne   Fricatives  French has three pairs of homorganic fricatives distinguished by voicing  i e  labiodental  f   v   dental  s   z   and palato alveolar          Notice that  s   z  are dental  like the plosives  t   d   and the nasal  n   French has one rhotic whose pronunciation varies considerably among speakers and phonetic contexts  In general it is described as a voiced uvular fricative as in   u  roue   wheel    Vowels are often lengthened before this segment  It can be reduced to an approximant  particularly in final position  e g  fort  or reduced to zero in some word final positions  For other speakers  a uvular trill is also common  and an apical trill  r  occurs in some dialects  Lateral and central approximants  The lateral approximant  l  is unvelarised in both onset  lire  and coda position  il   In the onset  the central approximants  w        and  j  each correspond to a high vowel   u    y   and  i  respectively  There are a few minimal pairs where the approximant and corresponding vowel contrast  but there are also many cases where they are in free variation  Contrasts between  j  and  i  occur in final position as in  p j  paye   pay   vs   p i  pays   country   French pronunciation follows strict rules based on spelling  but French spelling is often based more on history than phonology  The rules for pronunciation vary between dialects  but the standard rules are  final consonants  Final single consonants  in particular s  x  z  t  d  n  g and m  are normally silent   A consonant is considered  final  when no vowel follows it even if one or more consonants follow it   The final letters c  f  k  q and l  however  are normally pronounced  The final r is usually silent when it follows an e in a word of two or more syllables  but is pronounced in other cases  The t is pronounced when it follows a c  When the following word begins with a vowel  however  a silent consonant may once again be pronounced  to provide a liaison or  link  between the two words  Some liaisons are mandatory  for example the s in les amants or vous avez  some are optional  depending on dialect and register  for example the first s in deux cents euros or euros irlandais  and some are forbidden  for example the s in beaucoup d hommes aiment  The t of et is never pronounced and the silent final consonant of a noun is only pronounced in the plural and in set phrases like pied   terre  Doubling a final n and adding a silent e at the end of a word  e g  chien   chienne  makes it clearly pronounced  Doubling a final l and adding a silent e  e g  gentil   gentille  adds a  j  sound if the l is preceded by the letter i  elision or vowel dropping  Some monosyllabic function words ending in a or e  such as je and que  drop their final vowel when placed before a word that begins with a vowel sound  thus avoiding a hiatus   The missing vowel is replaced by an apostrophe   e g  je ai is instead pronounced and spelled   j ai   This gives  for example  the same pronunciation for l homme qu il a vu   the man whom he saw   and l homme qui l a vu   the man who saw him    However  for Belgian French the sentences are pronounced differently  in the first sentence the syllable break is as  qu il a   while the second breaks as  qui l a   It can also be noted that  in Quebec French  the second example  l homme qui l a vu  is more emphasized on l a vu   edit  Writing system  edit  Alphabet Main article  French alphabet French is written with the 26 letters of the basic Latin script  with four diacritics appearing on vowels  circumflex accent  acute accent  grave accent  diaeresis  and the cedilla appearing in      There are two ligatures      and       edit  Orthography Main article  French orthography French spelling  like English spelling  tends to preserve obsolete pronunciation rules  This is mainly due to extreme phonetic changes since the Old French period  without a corresponding change in spelling  see Vocabulary below   Moreover  some conscious changes were made to restore Latin orthography  Old French doit  gt  French doigt  finger   Latin digitus  Old French pie  gt  French pied  foot   Latin pes  stem  ped    As a result  it can be difficult to predict the spelling of a word based on the sound  Final consonants are generally silent  except when the following word begins with a vowel  For example  all of these words end in a vowel sound  pied  aller  les  finit  beaux  The same words followed by a vowel  however  may sound the consonants  as they do in these examples  beaux arts  les amis  pied   terre  On the other hand  a given spelling will usually lead to a predictable sound  and the Acad mie fran aise works hard to enforce and update this correspondence  citation needed  In particular  a given vowel combination or diacritic predictably leads to one phoneme  French writing  as with any language  is affected by the spoken language  In Old French  the plural for animal was animals  The  als  sequence was unstable and was turned into a diphthong  aus   This change was then reflected in the orthography  animaus  The us ending  very common in Latin  was then abbreviated by copists monks by the letter x  resulting in a written form animax  As the French language further evolved  the pronunciation of au turned into  o  so that the u was reestablished in orthography for consistency  resulting in modern French animaux  pronounced first  animos  before the final  s  was dropped in contemporary French   The same is true for cheval pluralized as chevaux and many others  In addition  castel pl  castels became ch teau pl  ch teaux Nasal  n and m  When n or m follows a vowel or diphthong  the n or m becomes silent and causes the preceding vowel to become nasalized  i e  pronounced with the soft palate extended downward so as to allow part of the air to leave through the nostrils   Exceptions are when the n or m is doubled  or immediately followed by a vowel  The prefixes en  and em  are always nasalized  The rules are more complex than this but may vary between dialects  Digraphs  French uses not only diacritics to specify its large range of vowel sounds and diphthongs  but also specific combinations of vowels  sometimes with following consonants  to show which sound is intended  Gemination  Within words  double consonants are generally not pronounced as geminates in modern French  but geminates can be heard in the cinema or TV news from as recently as the 1970s  and in very refined elocution they may still occur   For example  illusion is pronounced  ilyzj    and not  il yzj     But gemination does occur between words  For example  une info   a news item  or  a piece of information   is pronounced  yn  fo   whereas une nympho   a nymphomaniac   is pronounced  yn   fo   Accents are used sometimes for pronunciation  sometimes to distinguish similar words  and sometimes for etymology alone  Accents that affect pronunciation The acute accent  l accent aigu      e g   cole school   means that the vowel is pronounced  e  instead of the default      The grave accent  l accent grave      e g   l ve pupil  means that the vowel is pronounced     instead of the default      The circumflex  l accent circonflexe     e g  for t forest  shows that an e is pronounced     and that an   is pronounced  o   In standard French  it also signifies a pronunciation of     for the letter    but this differentiation is disappearing  In the late 19th century  the circumflex was used in place of s after a vowel  where that letter s was not to be pronounced  Thus  forest became for t and hospital became h pital  The diaeresis  le tr ma   e g  na f   naive  No l   Christmas  as in English  specifies that this vowel is pronounced separately from the preceding one  not combined  and is not a schwa  The cedilla  la c dille     e g  gar on boy  means that the letter   is pronounced  s  in front of the hard vowels a  o and u  c is otherwise  k  before a hard vowel   C is always pronounced  s  in front of the soft vowels e  i  and y  thus   is never found in front of soft vowels  Accents with no pronunciation effect The circumflex does not affect the pronunciation of the letters i or u  and in most dialects  a as well  It usually indicates that an s came after it long ago  as in  le  isle  compare with English island   The explanation is that some words share the same orthography  and the circumflex is put here to spot the difference between the two words  For example  dites  you say    d tes  you said   or even du  of the    d   past for the verb devoir   must  have to  owe  in this case  the circumflex splits at the plural and the feminine   All other accents are used only to distinguish similar words  as in the case of distinguishing the adverbs l  and o    there    where   from the article la   the  fem  sing   and the conjunction ou   or   respectively  Some proposals exist to simplify the existing writing system  but they still fail to gather interest  53  54  55   edit  Grammar Main article  French grammar French grammar shares several notable features with most other Romance languages  including  the loss of Latin s declensions only two grammatical genders the development of grammatical articles from Latin demonstratives new tenses formed from auxiliaries French declarative word order is subject verb object  although if the object is a pronoun  it precedes the verb  Some types of sentences allow for or require different word orders  in particular inversion of the subject and verb like  Parlez vous fran ais    when asking a question rather than just  Vous parlez fran ais    Both questions mean the same thing  however  a rising inflection is always used on both of them whenever asking a question  especially on the second one  Specifically  the first translates into   Do you speak French   while the second one is literally just   You speak French    edit  Vocabulary The majority of French words derive from Vulgar Latin or were constructed from Latin or Greek roots  In many cases a single etymological root appears in French in a  popular  or native form  inherited from Vulgar Latin  and a learned form  borrowed later from Classical Latin  The following pairs consist of a native noun and a learned adjective  brother  fr re   fraternel  lt  from Latin frater finger  doigt   digital  lt  from Latin digitum faith  foi   fid le  lt  from Latin fidem eye   il   oculaire  lt  from Latin oculum There are also noun noun and adjective adjective pairs  thing cause  chose   cause  lt  from Latin causa cold  froid   frigide  lt  from Latin frigidum It can be difficult to identify the Latin source of native French words  because in the evolution from Vulgar Latin  unstressed syllables were severely reduced and the remaining vowels and consonants underwent significant modifications  It is estimated that 12   4 200  of common French words found in a typical dictionary such as the Petit Larousse or Micro Robert Plus  35 000 words  are of foreign origin  where Greek and Latin learned words are not seen as foreign   About 25   1 054  of these foreign words come from English and are fairly recent borrowings  The others are some 707 words from Italian  550 from ancient Germanic languages  481 from other Gallo Romance languages  215 from Arabic  164 from German  160 from Celtic languages  159 from Spanish  153 from Dutch  112 from Persian and Sanskrit  101 from Native American languages  89 from other Asian languages  56 from other Afro Asiatic languages  55 from Slavic languages and Baltic languages  10 from Basque and 144  about 3   from other languages  56   edit  Numerals The French counting system is partially vigesimal  twenty  vingt  is used as a base number in the names of numbers from 60 to 99  The French word for 80 is quatre vingts  literally  four twenties   and the word for 75 is soixante quinze  literally  sixty fifteen   This reform arose after the French Revolution to unify the different counting systems  mostly vigesimal near the coast  because of Celtic  via Breton  and Viking influences   This system is comparable to the archaic English use of score  as in  fourscore and seven   87   or  threescore and ten   70   In Old French  during the Middle Ages   all numbers from 30 to 99 could be said in either base 10 or base 20  e g  vint et doze  twenty and twelve  for 32  dous vinz et diz  two twenties and ten  for 50  uitante for 80  or nonante for 90  57  Belgian French  Swiss French and the French used in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Rwanda and Burundi are different in this respect  In Belgium and Switzerland 70 and 90 are septante and nonante  In Switzerland  depending on the local dialect  80 can be quatre vingts  Geneva  Neuch tel  Jura  or huitante  Vaud  Valais  Fribourg   Octante had been used in Switzerland in the past  but is now considered archaic  58  In Belgium and in its former African colonies  however  quatre vingts is universally used  It should also be noted that French  like most European languages  uses a period  also called a full stop  or a space to separate thousands where English uses a comma or  more recently  a space  The comma is used in French numbers as a decimal point  2 5   deux virgule cinq  Cardinal numbers in French from 1 to 20 are as follows  One  un une       m     yn   f  Two  deux  d   Three  trois  t w   Four  quatre  kat   Five  cinq  s  k  Six  six  sis  Seven  sept  s t  Eight  huit   it  Nine  neuf  n f  Ten  dix
