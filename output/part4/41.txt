to create a classless  moneyless  and stateless social order structured upon common ownership of the means of production  as well as a social  political and economic ideology that aims at the establishment of this social order  This movement  in its Marxist Leninist interpretations  significantly influenced the history of the 20th century  which saw intense rivalry between the  socialist world   socialist states ruled by Communist parties  and the  western world   countries with market economies   culminating in the Cold War between the Eastern bloc and the  Free World   citation needed  In Marxist theory  pure communism is a specific stage of historical development that inevitably emerges from the development of the productive forces that leads to a superabundance of material wealth  allowing for distribution based on need and social relations based on freely associated individuals  1  2  The exact definition of communism varies  and it is often mistakenly  in general political discourse  used interchangeably with socialism  however  Marxist theory contends that socialism is just a transitional stage on the road to communism  Leninism adds to Marxism the notion of a vanguard party to lead the proletarian revolution and to hold all political power after the revolution   in the name of the workers  and with worker participation  in a transitional stage between capitalism and socialism  Council communists and non Marxist libertarian communists and anarcho communists oppose the ideas of a vanguard party and a transition stage  and advocate for the construction of full communism to begin immediately upon the abolition of capitalism  There is a very wide range of theories amongst those particular communists in regards to how to build the types of institutions that would replace the various economic engines  such as food distribution  education  and hospitals  as they exist under capitalist systems or even whether to do so at all  Some of these communists have specific plans for the types of administrative bodies that would replace the current ones  while always qualifying that these bodies would be decentralised and worker owned  just as they currently are within the activist movements themselves  Others have no concrete set of post revolutionary blueprints at all  claiming instead that they simply trust that the world s workers and poor will figure out proper modes of distribution and wide scale production  and also coordination  entirely on their own  without the need for any structured  replacements  for capitalist state based control  citation needed  In the modern lexicon of what many sociologists and political commentators refer to as the  political mainstream   communism is often used to refer to the policies of communist states  i e   the ones totally controlled by communist parties  regardless of the practical content of the actual economic system they may preside over  Examples of this include the policies of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam where the economic system incorporates  doi moi   the People s Republic of China  PRC  or simply  China   where the economic system incorporates  socialist market economy   and the economic system of the Soviet Union which was described as  state capitalist  by non Leninist socialists and later by communists who increasingly opposed the post Stalin era Soviet model as it progressed over the course of the 20th century  e g  Maoists  Trotskyists and libertarian communists  and even at one point by Vladimir Lenin himself  3  Contents 1 Etymology and

the idea of a free society with no division or alienation  where mankind is free from oppression and scarcity  A communist society would have no governments  countries  or class divisions  In Marxist theory  the dictatorship of the proletariat is the intermediate system between capitalism and communism  when the government is in the process of changing the means of ownership from privatism to collective ownership  6  In political science  the term  communism  is sometimes used to refer to communist states  a form of government in which the state operates under a one party system and declares allegiance to Marxism Leninism or a derivative thereof  citation needed  In modern usage  the word  communism  is still often used to refer to the policies of self declared socialist governments comprising one party states which were single legal political party systems operating under centrally planned economies and a state ownership of the means of production  with the state  in turn  claiming that it represented the interests of the working classes  A significant sector of the modern communist movement alleges that these states never made an attempt to transition to a communist society  while others even argue that they never achieved a legitimate socialism  Most of these governments based their ideology on Marxism Leninism  but they did not call the system they had set up  communism   nor did they even necessarily claim at all times that the ideology was the sole driving force behind their policies  Mao Zedong  for example  pursued New Democracy  and Lenin in the early 1920s enacted war communism  later  the Vietnamese enacted doi moi  and the Chinese switched to socialism with Chinese characteristics  The governments labeled by other governments as  communist  generally claimed that they had set up a transitional socialist system  This system is sometimes referred to as state socialism or by other similar names   Pure communism  is a term sometimes used to refer to the stage in history after socialism  although just as many communists use simply the term  communism  to refer to that stage  The classless  stateless society that is meant to characterise this communism is one where decisions on what to produce and what policies to pursue are made in the best interests of the whole of society a sort of  of  by  and for the working class   rather than a rich class controlling the wealth and everyone else working for them on a wage basis  In this communism the interests of every member of society is given equal weight to the next  in the practical decision making process in both the political and economic spheres of life  Karl Marx  as well as some other communist philosophers  deliberately never provided a detailed description as to how communism would function as a social system  nor the precise ways in which the working class could or should rise up  nor any other material specifics of exactly how to get to communism from capitalism  In the Communist Manifesto  Marx does lay out a 10 point plan advising the redistribution of land and production to begin the transition to communism  but he ensured that even this was very general and all encompassing  It has always been presumed that Marx intended these theories to read this way specifically so that later theorists in specific situations could adapt communism to their own localities and conditions  Theory According to communist theory  the only way to abolish capitalist inequalities is to have the proletariat  working class   who collectively constitute the main producer of wealth in society  and who are perpetually exploited and marginalised by the bourgeoisie  wealthy class   to overthrow the capitalist system in a wide ranging social revolution  7  The revolution  in the theory of most individuals and groups espousing communist revolution  usually involves an armed rebellion  The revolution espoused can be explained by theorists in many different ways  and usually depends on the environment in which the particular communism theory originates  For example  the Chinese Revolution involved military combat between the Chinese Red and the Chinese Nationalist Armies  while the Vietnamese Revolution was characterised by guerilla warfare between the heavily backed Vietnam People s Army and various Western armies  culminating in the Vietnam War which ended in 1975  Meanwhile  the Cuban Revolution was essentially a coup that did not involve intensive wide scale military conflict between Fulgencio Batista s soldiers and those of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara  In fact  Castro initially did not believe that a vanguard party was necessary in Cuba s case  a view boosted by Batista s unpopularity at the time of the actual armed conflict between the two sides  Regardless of the specific form a communist revolution takes  its aim is for the working class to replace the exploiter class as the ruling class to establish a society without class divisions  called socialism  as a prelude to attempting to achieve the final stage of communism  8  History Countries of the world now  red  or previously  orange  officially structured as socialist states under communist  Marxist Leninist  governments  often called  communist states  in the West  Main article  History of communism According to Karl Marx   Communism differs from all previous movements in that it overturns the basis of all earlier relations of production and intercourse  and for the first time consciously treats all natural premises as the creatures of hitherto existing men  strips them of their natural character and subjugates them to the power of the united individuals     Karl Marx  The German Ideology  1845 9  Early communism Further information  Primitive communism  Religious communism  and Utopian socialism The origins of communism are debatable  and there are various historical groups  as well as theorists  whose beliefs have been subsequently described as communist  German philosopher Karl Marx saw primitive communism as the original  hunter gatherer state of humankind from which it arose  For Marx  only after humanity was capable of producing surplus  did private property develop  The idea of a classless society first emerged in Ancient Greece  10 Plato in his The Republic described it as a state where people shared all their property  wives  and children   The private and individual is altogether banished from life and things which are by nature private  such as eyes and ears and hands  have become common  and in some way see and hear and act in common  and all men express praise and feel joy and sorrow on the same occasions   10  In the history of Western thought  certain elements of the idea of a society based on common ownership of property can be traced back to ancient times  Examples include the Spartacus slave revolt in Rome  11  The 5th century Mazdak movement in what is now Iran has been described as  communistic  for challenging the enormous privileges of the noble classes and the clergy  criticizing the institution of private property and for striving for an egalitarian society  12  At one time or another  various small communist communities existed  generally under the inspiration of Scripture  13  In the medieval Christian church  for example  some monastic communities and religious orders shared their land and other property  see Religious and Christian communism   These groups often believed that concern with private property was a distraction from religious service to God and neighbour  citation needed  Communist thought has also been traced back to the work of 16th century English writer Thomas More  In his treatise Utopia  1516   More portrayed a society based on common ownership of property  whose rulers administered it through the application of reason  citation needed  In the 17th century  communist thought surfaced again in England  In England  a Puritan religious group known as the  Diggers  advocated the abolition of private ownership of land  14 Eduard Bernstein  in his 1895 Cromwell and Communism 15  argued that several groupings in the English Civil War  especially the Diggers espoused clear communistic  agrarian ideals  and that Oliver Cromwell s attitude to these groups was at best ambivalent and often hostile  16  Criticism of the idea of private property continued into the Age of Enlightenment of the 18th century  through such thinkers as Jean Jacques Rousseau in France  citation needed  Later  following the upheaval of the French Revolution  communism emerged as a political doctrine  17 Fran ois No l Babeuf  in particular  espoused the goals of common ownership of land and total economic and political equality among citizens  citation needed  Various social reformers in the early 19th century founded communities based on common ownership  But unlike many previous communist communities  they replaced the religious emphasis with a rational and philanthropic basis  18  Notable among them were Robert Owen  who founded New Harmony in Indiana  1825   and Charles Fourier  whose followers organized other settlements in the United States such as Brook Farm  1841 47   18  Later in the 19th century  Karl Marx described these social reformers as  utopian socialists  to contrast them with his program of  scientific socialism   a term coined by Friedrich Engels   Other writers described by Marx as  utopian socialists  included Saint Simon  In its modern form  communism grew out of the socialist movement of 19th century Europe  As the Industrial Revolution advanced  socialist critics blamed capitalism for the misery of the proletariat a new class of urban factory workers who laboured under often hazardous conditions  Foremost among these critics were Marx and his associate Friedrich Engels  In 1848  Marx and Engels offered a new definition of communism and popularized the term in their famous pamphlet The Communist Manifesto  18  Engels  who lived in Manchester  observed the organization of the Chartist movement  see History of British socialism   while Marx departed from his university comrades to meet the proletariat in France and Germany  citation needed  Growth of modern communism This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations

character  The first major figure of Russian Marxism was Georgi Plekhanov  Underlying the work of Plekhanov was the assumption that Russia  less urbanized and industrialized than Western Europe  had many years to go before society would be ready for proletarian revolution to occur  and a transitional period of a bourgeois democratic regime would be required to replace Tsarism with a socialist and later communist society   EB  citation needed  In Russia  the 1917 October Revolution was the first time any party with an avowedly Marxist orientation  in this case the Bolshevik Party  seized state power  The assumption of state power by the Bolsheviks generated a great deal of practical and theoretical debate within the Marxist movement  Marx predicted that socialism and communism would be built upon foundations laid by the most advanced capitalist development  Russia  however  was one of the poorest countries in Europe with an enormous  largely illiterate peasantry and a minority of industrial workers  Marx had explicitly stated that Russia might be able to skip the stage of bourgeoisie capitalism  19  Other socialists also believed that a Russian revolution could be the precursor of workers  revolutions in the West  The moderate Mensheviks opposed Lenin s Bolshevik plan for socialist revolution before capitalism was more fully developed  The Bolsheviks  successful rise to power was based upon the slogans such as  Peace  bread  and land  which tapped the massive public desire for an end to Russian involvement in the First World War  the peasants  demand for land reform  and popular support for the Soviets  20  The usage of the terms  communism  and  socialism  shifted after 1917  when the Bolsheviks changed their name to Communist Party and installed a single party regime devoted to the implementation of socialist policies under Leninism  citation needed  The Second International had dissolved in 1916 over national divisions  as the separate national parties that composed it did not maintain a unified front against the war  instead generally supporting their respective nation s role  Lenin thus created the Third International  Comintern  in 1919 and sent the Twenty one Conditions  which included democratic centralism  to all European socialist parties willing to adhere  In France  for example  the majority of the French Section of the Workers  International  SFIO  party split in 1921 to form the French Section of the Communist International  SFIC   citation needed  Henceforth  the term  Communism  was applied to the objective of the parties founded under the umbrella of the Comintern  Their program called for the uniting of workers of the world for revolution  which would be followed by the establishment of a dictatorship of the proletariat as well as the development of a socialist economy  Ultimately  if their program held  there would develop a harmonious classless society  with the withering away of the state  citation

or non alignment  black   During the Russian Civil War  1918 1922   the Bolsheviks nationalized all productive property and imposed a policy of war communism  which put factories and railroads under strict government control  collected and rationed food  and introduced some bourgeois management of industry  After three years of war and the 1921 Kronstadt rebellion  Lenin declared the New Economic Policy  NEP  in 1921  which was to give a  limited place for a limited time to capitalism   The NEP lasted until 1928  when Joseph Stalin achieved party leadership  and the introduction of the first Five Year Plan spelled the end of it  Following the Russian Civil War  the Bolsheviks  in 1922  formed the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  USSR   or Soviet Union  from the former Russian Empire  Following Lenin s democratic centralism  the communist parties were organized on a hierarchical basis  with active cells of members as the broad base  they were made up only of elite cadres approved by higher members of the party as being reliable and completely subject to party discipline  21  Following World War II  Communists consolidated power in Central and Eastern Europe  and in 1949  the Communist Party of China  CPC   led by Mao Zedong  established the People s Republic of China  which would follow its own ideological path of Communist development following the Sino Soviet split  Cuba  North Korea  Vietnam  Laos  Cambodia  Angola  and Mozambique were among the other countries in the Third World that adopted or imposed a Communist government at some point  By the early 1980s almost one third of the world s population lived in Communist states  including the former Soviet Union and PRC  citation needed  Communist states such as the Soviet Union and PRC succeeded in becoming industrial and technological powers  challenging the capitalists  powers in the arms race and space race  Cold War years USSR postage stamp depicting the communist state launching the first artificial satellite Sputnik 1  By virtue of the Soviet Union s victory in the Second World War in 1945  the Red Army occupied nations not only in Central and Eastern Europe  but also in East Asia  consequently  communism as a movement spread to many new countries  This expansion of communism both in Europe and Asia gave rise to a few different branches of its own  such as Maoism  22  Communism had been vastly strengthened by the winning of many new nations into the sphere of Soviet influence and strength in Central and Eastern Europe  Governments modelled on Soviet Communism took power with Soviet assistance in Bulgaria  Czechoslovakia  East Germany  Poland  Hungary and Romania  A Communist government was also created under Marshal Tito in Yugoslavia  but Tito s independent policies led to the expulsion of Yugoslavia from the Cominform  which had replaced the Comintern  Titoism  a new branch in the world Communist movement  was labelled  deviationist   Albania also became an independent Communist nation after World War II  23  By 1950  the Chinese Communists held all of Mainland China  thus controlling the most populous nation in the world  Other areas where rising Communist strength provoked dissension and in some cases led to actual fighting through conventional and guerrilla warfare include the Korean War  Laos  many nations of the Middle East and Africa  and notably succeeded in the case of the Vietnam War against the military power of the United States and its allies  With varying degrees of success  Communists attempted to unite with nationalist and socialist forces against what they saw as Western imperialism in these poor countries  Red Scare A 1947 propaganda book published by the Catechetical Guild Educational Society warning of the dangers of a communist revolution  Main article  Red Scare With the exception of the contribution in World War II by the Soviet Union  China  and the Italian resistance movement  communism was seen as a rival  and a threat to western democracies and capitalism for most of the 20th century  24  This rivalry peaked during the Cold War  as the world s two remaining superpowers  the United States and the Soviet Union  polarized most of the world into two camps of nations  This was characterized in the West as The Free World vs  Behind the Iron Curtain  citation needed  It supported the spread of their respective economic and political systems  capitalism and communism  and strengthened their military powers  As a result  the camps developed new weapon systems  stockpiled nuclear weapons  and competed in space exploration  Near the beginning of the Cold War  on February 9  1950  Senator Joseph McCarthy from Wisconsin accused 205 Americans working in the State Department of being  card

Romania  and Hungary all abandoned Communist rule by 1990  In 1991  the Soviet Union dissolved  By the beginning of the 21st century  states controlled by communist parties under a single party system include the People s Republic of China  Cuba  Laos  Vietnam  and informally North Korea  Communist parties  or their descendant parties  remain politically important in many countries  President

including Vietnam  A tableau in a communist rally in Kerala  India  of a young farmer and worker  A Communist demonstration in Red Square  Moscow  July 2009  Theories within Marxism as to why communism in Central and Eastern Europe was not achieved after socialist revolutions pointed to such elements as the pressure of external capitalist states  the relative backwardness of the societies in which the revolutions occurred  and the emergence of a bureaucratic stratum or class that arrested or diverted the transition press in its own interests   Scott and Marshall  2005  Marxist critics of the Soviet Union  most notably Trotsky  referred to the Soviet system  along with other Communist states  as  degenerated  or  deformed workers  states   arguing that the Soviet system fell far short of Marx s communist ideal and he claimed the working class was politically dispossessed  The ruling stratum of the Soviet Union was held to be a bureaucratic caste  but not a new ruling class  despite their political control  Anarchists who adhere to Participatory economics claim that the Soviet Union became dominated by powerful intellectual elites who in a capitalist system crown the proletariat s labour on behalf of the bourgeoisie  Non Marxists  in contrast  have often applied the term to any society ruled by a communist party and to any party aspiring to create a society similar to such existing nation states  In the social sciences  societies ruled by communist parties are distinct for their single party control and their socialist economic bases  While some social and political scientists applied the concept of  totalitarianism  to these societies  others identified possibilities for independent political activity within them  28  29  and stressed their

communist ideologies Variations to the communist movement have developed  each based upon the ideas of different political theorists  usually as additions or interpretations of various forms of Marxism  the collective philosophies of the German philosophers Karl Marx  30 Marxism Leninism is the synthesis of Vladimir Lenin s contributions to Marxism  such as how a revolutionary party should be organised  31 Trotskyism is Leon Trotsky s conception of Marxism  influenced by Lenin  and meanwhile  Maoism is Mao Zedong s interpretation of Marxism to suit the conditions of China at that time  and is fairly heavy on the need for agrarian worker support as the engine for the revolution  rather than workers in the urban areas  which were still very small at that point  Self identified communists hold a variety of views  including Marxism Leninism  Trotskyism  council communism  Luxemburgism  anarchist communism  Christian communism  and various currents of left communism  However  the offshoots of the Marxist Leninist interpretations of Marxism are the best known of these and had been a driving force in international relations during the last quarter of the 19th century and most of the 20th century up to around 1989 and what historians refer to as  the collapse of communism   32  However  other forms of communism worldwide continue to exist in the ideologies of various individual labor movement trade unions worldwide  particularly in Europe and the Third World  and also in communist parties that continue to espouse the ultimate need for communist revolution  Most communists today tend to agree that the remaining communist states  such as China  Vietnam and especially North Korea  which has replaced Marxism Leninism with Juche as its official ideology   have nothing to do with communism  whether as practised currently within leftist resistance movements and parties  or in terms of the ideologies and programmes held by those movements  33  34  35  36  A diverse range of theories persist amongst prominent globally known people such as Slavoj Zizek  Michael Parenti  Alain Badiou and other radical left thinkers who proclaim themselves communists  they and others like them are examples of present day well known figures in the modern communist movement  Marxism The Communist Manifesto Main article  Marxism Like other socialists  Marx and Engels sought an end to capitalism and the systems which they perceived to be responsible for the exploitation of workers  Whereas earlier socialists often favored longer term social reform  Marx and Engels believed that popular revolution was all but inevitable  and the only path to socialism and communism  According to the Marxist argument for communism  the main characteristic of human life in class society is alienation  and communism is desirable because it entails the full realization of human freedom  37  Marx here follows Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel in conceiving freedom not merely as an absence of restraints but as action with content  38  According to Marx  communism s outlook on freedom was based on an agent  obstacle  and goal  The agent is the common working people  the obstacles are class divisions  economic inequalities  unequal life chances  and false consciousness  and the goal is the fulfilment of human needs including satisfying work  and fair share of the product  39  40  They believed that communism allowed people to do what they want  but also put humans in such conditions and such relations with one another that they would not wish to exploit  or have any need to  Whereas for Hegel the unfolding of this ethical life in history is mainly driven by the realm of ideas  for Marx  communism emerged from material forces  particularly the development of the means of production  38  Marxism holds that a process of class conflict and revolutionary struggle will result in victory for the proletariat and the establishment of a communist society in which private property and ownership is abolished over time and the means of production and subsistence belong to the community   Private property and ownership  in this context  means ownerships of the means of production  not private possessions   41  Marx himself wrote little about life under communism  giving only the most general indication as to what constituted a communist society  It is clear that it entails abundance in which there is little limit to the projects that humans may undertake  citation needed  In the popular slogan that was adopted by the communist movement  communism was a world in which each gave according to their abilities  and received according to their needs  The German Ideology  1845  was one of Marx s few writings to elaborate on the communist future   In communist society  where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes  society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow  to hunt in the morning  fish in the afternoon  rear cattle in the evening  criticise after dinner  just as I have a mind  without ever becoming hunter  fisherman  herdsman or critic     42  Marx s lasting vision was to add this vision to a theory of how society was moving in a law governed way towards communism  and  with some tension  a political theory that explained why revolutionary activity was required to bring it about  38  In the late 19th century  the terms  socialism  and  communism  were often used interchangeably  However  Marx and Engels argued that communism would not emerge from capitalism in a fully developed state  but would pass through a  first phase  in which most productive property was owned in common  but with some class differences remaining  The  first phase  would eventually evolve into a  higher phase  in which class differences were eliminated  and a state was no longer needed  Lenin frequently used the term  socialism  to refer to Marx and Engels  supposed  first phase  of communism and used the term  communism  interchangeably with Marx and Engels   higher phase  of communism  43  These later aspects  particularly as developed by Vladimir Lenin  provided the underpinning for the mobilizing features of 20th century communist parties  Marxism Leninism Main articles  Marxism Leninism and Leninism Leninism is the political movement developed by Vladimir Lenin  which has become the foundation for the organizational structure of most major communist parties  Leninists advocate the creation of a vanguard party led by professional revolutionaries in order to lead the working class revolution  Leninists believe that socialism will not arise spontaneously through the natural decay of capitalism and that workers are unable to organize and develop socialist consciousness without the guidance of the Vanguard party  After taking power  Vanguard parties seek to create a socialist state dominated by the Vanguard party in order to direct social development and defend against counterrevolutionary insurrection  The mode of industrial organization championed by Leninism and Marxism Leninism is the capitalist model of scientific management pioneered by Fredrick Taylor  Marxism Leninism is a version of Leninism merged with classical Marxism adopted by the Soviet Union and most communist parties across the world today  It shaped the Soviet Union and influenced communist parties worldwide  It was heralded as a possibility of building communism via a massive program of industrialization and collectivisation  Despite the fall of the Soviet Union and the  Eastern Bloc   meaning communist countries of Eastern and Central Europe   many communist parties of the world today still lay claim to uphold the Marxist Leninist banner  Marxism Leninism expands on Marxists thoughts by bringing the theories to what Lenin and other Communists considered  the age of capitalist imperialism  and a renewed focus on party building  the development of a socialist state  and democratic centralism as an organizational principle  Lenin s pamphlet What is to be Done   1902   proposed that the  urban  proletariat can successfully achieve revolutionary consciousness only under the leadership of a vanguard party of professional revolutionaries who can achieve aims only with internal democratic centralism in the party  tactical and ideological policy decisions are agreed via democracy  and every member must support and promote the agreed party policy  To wit  capitalism can be overthrown only with revolution because attempts to reform capitalism from within  Fabianism  and from without  democratic socialism  will fail because of its inherent contradictions  The purpose of a Leninist revolutionary vanguard party is the forceful deposition of the incumbent government  assume power  as agent of the proletariat  and establish a dictatorship of the proletariat government  Moreover  as the government  the vanguard party must educate the proletariat to dispel the societal false consciousness of religion and nationalism that are culturally instilled by the bourgeoisie in facilitating exploitation  The dictatorship of the proletariat is governed with a de centralized direct democracy practised via soviets  councils  where the workers exercise political power  cf  soviet democracy   the fifth chapter of State  amp  Revolution  describes it         the dictatorship of the proletariat i e  the organisation of the vanguard of the oppressed as the ruling class for the purpose of crushing the oppressors        An immense expansion of democracy  which for the first time becomes democracy for the poor  democracy for the people  and not democracy for the rich        and suppression by force  i e  exclusion from democracy  for the exploiters and oppressors of the people this is the change which democracy undergoes during the transition from capitalism to communism

revolutionary elements of Leninism the disciplined vanguard party  a dictatorship of the proletariat  and class war  Stalinism Main article  Stalinism Stalinism was the political system of the Soviet Union and the countries within the Soviet sphere of influence during the leadership of Joseph Stalin  The term usually defines the style of a government rather than an ideology  The ideology was officially Marxism Leninism theory  reflecting that Stalin himself was not a theoretician  in contrast to Marx and Lenin  and prided himself on maintaining the legacy of Lenin as a founding father for the Soviet Union and the future Socialist world  Stalinism is an interpretation of their ideas  and a certain political regime claiming to apply those ideas in ways fitting the changing needs of Soviet society  as with the transition from  socialism at a snail s pace  in the mid twenties to the rapid industrialization of the Five Year Plans  The main contributions of Stalin to communist theory were  The groundwork for the Soviet policy concerning nationalities  laid in Stalin s 1913 work Marxism and the National Question  46  praised by Lenin  Socialism in One Country  stating that communists should attain socialism in their own country as a prelude to internationalising  The theory of aggravation of the class struggle along with the development of socialism  a theoretical base supporting the repression of political opponents as necessary  Trotskyism Main article  Trotskyism Leon Trotsky reading The Militant  Trotskyism is the branch of Marxism that was developed by Leon Trotsky  It supports the theory of permanent revolution and world revolution instead of the two stage theory and socialism in one country  It supported proletarian internationalism and another Communist revolution in the Soviet Union  which  under the leadership of Stalin  Trotsky claimed had become a degenerated worker s state  rather than the dictatorship of the proletariat  Trotsky and his supporters organized into the Left Opposition and their platform became known as Trotskyism  Stalin eventually succeeded in gaining control of the Soviet regime and Trotskyist attempts to remove Stalin from power resulted in Trotsky s exile from the Soviet Union in 1929  During Trotsky s exile  world communism fractured into two distinct branches  Marxism Leninism and Trotskyism  8  Trotsky later founded the Fourth International  a Trotskyist rival to the Comintern  in 1938  Trotskyist ideas have continually found a modest echo among political movements in some countries in Latin America and Asia  especially in Argentina  Brazil  Bolivia and Sri Lanka  Many Trotskyist organizations are also active in more stable  developed countries in North America and Western Europe  Trotsky s politics differed sharply from those of Stalin and Mao  most importantly in declaring the need for an international proletarian revolution  rather than socialism in one country  and unwavering support for a true dictatorship of the proletariat based on democratic principles  However  as a whole  Trotsky s theories and attitudes were never accepted in worldwide mainstream Communist circles after Trotsky s expulsion  either within or outside of the Soviet bloc  This remained the case even after the Secret Speech and subsequent events critics claim exposed the fallibility of Stalin  Maoism Main article  Maoism Maoism is the Marxist Leninist trend of Communism associated with Mao Zedong and was mostly practiced within China  Khrushchev s reforms heightened ideological differences between China and the Soviet Union  which became increasingly apparent in the 1960s  Parties and groups that supported the Communist Party of China  CPC  in their criticism against the new Soviet leadership proclaimed themselves as  anti revisionist  and denounced the CPSU and the parties aligned with it as revisionist  capitalist roaders   The Sino Soviet Split resulted in divisions amongst communist parties around the world  Notably  the Party of Labour of Albania sided with the People s Republic of China  Effectively  the CPC under Mao s leadership became the rallying forces of a parallel international Communist tendency  Definitions of Maoism vary  Within the Chinese context  Maoism can refer to Mao s belief in the mobilization of the masses  particularly in large scale political movements  it can also refer to the egalitarianism that was seen during Mao s era as opposed to the free market ideology of Deng Xiaoping  some scholars additionally define personality cults and political sloganeering as  Maoist  practices  Contemporary Maoists in China criticize the social inequalities created by a capitalist and  revisionist  Communist party  Prachanda  giving a speech at Pokhara  Nepal Prachanda Path See also  Nepalese Civil War Prachanda Path refers to the ideological line of the Unified Communist Party of Nepal  This thought is an extension of Marxism  Leninism and Maoism  totally based on home ground politics of Nepal  The doctrine came into existence after it was realized that the ideology of Marxism  Leninism and Maoism could not be practiced completely as it was done in the past  And an ideology suitable  based on the ground reality of Nepalese politics was adopted by the party  Others Hoxhaism Main article  Hoxhaism Another variant of anti revisionist Marxism Leninism appeared after the ideological row between the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labour of Albania in 1978  The Albanians rallied a new separate international tendency  which would demarcate itself by a strict defence of the legacy of Joseph Stalin and fierce criticism of virtually all other Communist groupings as revisionism  Critical of the United States  the Soviet Union  and China  Enver Hoxha declared the latter two to be social imperialist and condemned the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia by withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact in response  Hoxha declared Albania to be the world s only Marxist Leninist state after 1978  The Albanians were able to win over a large share of the Maoists  mainly in Latin America such as the Popular Liberation Army  but also had a significant international following in general  This tendency has occasionally been labelled as  Hoxhaism  after him  After the fall of the Communist government in Albania  the pro Albanian parties are grouped around an international conference and the publication  Unity and Struggle   Titoism Main article  Titoism Elements of Titoism are characterized by policies and practices based on the principle that in each country  the means of attaining ultimate communist goals must be dictated by the conditions of that particular country  rather than by a pattern set in another country  During Tito s era  this specifically meant that the communist goal should be pursued independently of  and often in opposition to  the policies of the Soviet Union  The term was originally meant as a pejorative  and was labelled by Moscow as a heresy during the period of tensions between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia known as the Informbiro period from 1948 to 1955  Unlike the rest of Central and Eastern Europe  which fell under Stalin s influence post World War II  Yugoslavia  due to the strong leadership of Marshal Tito and the fact that the Yugoslav Partisans liberated Yugoslavia with only limited help from the Red Army  remained independent from Moscow  It became the only country in the Balkans to resist pressure from Moscow to join the Warsaw Pact and remained  socialist  but independent  until the collapse of Soviet socialism in the late 1980s and early 1990s  Throughout his time in office  Tito prided himself on Yugoslavia s independence from Russia  with Yugoslavia never accepting full membership of the Comecon and Tito s open rejection of many aspects of Stalinism as the most obvious manifestations of this  Eurocommunism Eurocommunism was a trend in the 1970s and 1980s within various Western European communist parties to develop a theory and practice of social transformation that was more relevant in a Western European democracy and less aligned to the influence or control of the Soviet Union  Parties such as the Italian Communist Party  PCI   the French Communist Party  PCF   and the Communist Party of Spain  PCE   were politically active and electorally significant in their respective countries   citation needed  The main theoretical foundation of Eurocommunism was Antonio Gramsci s writing about Marxist theory which questioned the sectarianism of the Left and encouraged communist parties to develop social alliances to win hegemonic support for social reforms  Eurocommunist parties expressed their fidelity to democratic institutions more clearly than before and attempted to widen their appeal by embracing public sector middle class workers  new social movements such as feminism and gay liberation and more publicly questioning the Soviet Union  Early inspirations can also be found in the Austromarxism and its seeking of a  third  democratic  way  to socialism  Libertarian and non Leninist forms of Marxism Main article  Libertarian Marxism Libertarian Marxism refers to a broad scope of economic and political philosophies that emphasize the anti authoritarian aspects of Marxism  Early currents of libertarian Marxism  known as left communism  47  emerged in opposition to Marxism Leninism 48  and its derivatives  such as Stalinism  Maoism  and Trotskyism  49  Libertarian Marxism is also critical of reformist positions  such as those held by social democrats  50  Libertarian Marxist currents often draw from Marx and Engels  later works  specifically the Grundrisse and The Civil War in France  51  emphasizing the Marxist belief in the ability of the working class to forge its own destiny without the need for a revolutionary party or state to mediate or aid its liberation  52  Along with anarchism  Libertarian Marxism is one of the main currents of libertarian socialism  53  Libertarian Marxism includes such currents as Luxemburgism  council communism  left communism  Socialisme ou Barbarie  the Johnson Forest tendency  world socialism  Lettrism Situationism and operaismo autonomism  and New Left  54  Libertarian Marxism has often had a strong influence on both post left and social anarchists  Notable theorists of libertarian Marxism have included Anton Pannekoek  Raya Dunayevskaya  CLR James  Antonio Negri  Cornelius Castoriadis  Maurice Brinton  Guy Debord  Daniel Gu rin  Ernesto Screpanti and Raoul Vaneigem  Council communism Main article  Council communism Council communism is a far left movement originating in Germany and the Netherlands in the 1920s  Its primary organization was the Communist Workers Party of Germany  KAPD   Council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within both left wing Marxism and libertarian socialism  The central argument of council communism  in contrast to those of social democracy and Leninist Communism  is that democratic workers  councils arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural form of working class organisation and governmental power  This view is opposed to both the reformist and the Leninist ideologies  with their stress on  respectively  parliaments and institutional government  i e   by applying social reforms   on the one hand  and vanguard parties and participative democratic centralism on the other   The core principle of council communism is that the government and the economy should be managed by workers  councils composed of delegates elected at workplaces and recallable at any moment  As such  council communists oppose state run authoritarian  State socialism   State capitalism   They also oppose the idea of a  revolutionary party   since council communists believe that a revolution led by a party will necessarily produce a party dictatorship  Council communists support a worker s democracy  which they want to produce through a federation of workers  councils  Rosa Luxemburg  prominent left communist critic of Leninism Left communism Main article  Left communism Left communism is the range of communist viewpoints held by the communist left  which criticizes the political ideas of the Bolsheviks at certain periods  from a position that is asserted to be more authentically Marxist and proletarian than the views of Leninism held by the Communist International after its first and during its second congress  Left Communists see themselves to the left of Leninists  whom they tend to see as  left of capital   not socialists   anarchist communists  some of whom they consider internationalist socialists  as well as some other revolutionary socialist tendencies  for example De Leonists  who they tend to see as being internationalist socialists only in limited instances   Although she died before left communism became a distinct tendency  Rosa Luxemburg has heavily influenced most left communists  both politically and theoretically  Proponents of left communism have included Amadeo Bordiga  Herman Gorter  Anton Pannekoek  Otto R hle  Karl Korsch  Sylvia Pankhurst and Paul Mattick  Prominent left communist groups existing today include the International Communist Party  the International Communist Current and the Internationalist Communist Tendency  Situationist International Main article  Situationist International The Situationist International was a restricted group of international revolutionaries founded in 1957  and which had its peak in its influence on the unprecedented general wildcat strikes of May 1968 in France  With their ideas rooted in Marxism and the 20th century European artistic avant gardes  they advocated experiences of life being alternative to those admitted by the capitalist order  for the fulfillment of human primitive desires and the pursuing of a superior passional quality  For this purpose they suggested and experimented with the construction of situations  namely the setting up of environments favorable for the fulfillment of such desires  Using methods drawn from the arts  they developed a series of experimental fields of study for the construction of such situations  like unitary urbanism and psychogeography  They fought against the main obstacle on the fulfillment of such superior passional living  identified by them in advanced capitalism  Their theoretical work peaked on the highly influential book The Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debord  Debord argued in 1967 that spectacular features like mass media and advertising have a central role in an advanced capitalist society  which is to show a fake reality in order to mask the real capitalist degradation of human life  To overthrow such a system  the Situationist International supported the May  68 revolts  and asked the workers to occupy the factories and to run them with direct democracy  through workers  councils composed by instantly revocable delegates  After publishing in the last issue of the magazine an analysis of the May 1968 revolts  and the strategies that will need to be adopted in future revolutions  55  the SI was dissolved in 1972  56  Autonomism Main article  Autonomism Antonio Negri  main theorist of Italian autonomism Autonomism refers to a set of left wing political and social movements and theories close to the socialist movement  As an identifiable theoretical system it first emerged in Italy in the 1960s from workerist  operaismo  communism  Later  post Marxist and anarchist tendencies became significant after influence from the Situationists  the failure of Italian far left movements in the 1970s  and the emergence of a number of important theorists including Antonio Negri  who had contributed to the 1969 founding of Potere Operaio  Mario Tronti  Paolo Virno  etc  Through translations made available by Danilo Montaldi and others  the Italian autonomists drew upon previous activist research in the United States by the Johnson Forest Tendency and in France by the group Socialisme ou Barbarie  It influenced the German and Dutch Autonomen  the worldwide Social Centre movement  and today is influential in Italy  France  and to a lesser extent the English speaking countries  Those who describe themselves as autonomists now vary from Marxists to post structuralists and anarchists  The Autonomist Marxist and Autonomen movements provided inspiration to some on the revolutionary left in English speaking countries  particularly among anarchists  many of whom have adopted autonomist tactics  Some English speaking anarchists even describe themselves as Autonomists  The Italian operaismo movement also influenced Marxist academics such as Harry Cleaver  John Holloway  Steve Wright  and Nick Dyer Witheford  Non Marxist schools The dominant forms of communism are based on Marxism  but non Marxist versions of communism  such as Christian communism and anarchist communism  also exist  Anarcho communism Main article  Anarchist communism Peter Kropotkin  main theorist of anarcho communism Anarchist communism  also known as libertarian communism  is a theory of anarchism which advocates the abolition of the state  private property  and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production  57  58 direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers  councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle   from each according to his ability  to each according to his need   59  60  Anarcho communism differs from marxism rejecting its view about the need for a State Socialism phase before building communism  The main anarcho communist theorist Peter Kropotkin argued  that a revolutionary society should  transform itself immediately into a communist society    that is  should go immediately into what Marx had regarded as the  more advanced   completed  phase of communism   61  In this way it tries to avoid the reappearence of  class divisions and the need for a state to oversee everything   61  Some forms of anarchist communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are egoist and strongly influenced by radical individualism  62  63  64  believing that anarchist communism does not require a communitarian nature at all  Most anarcho communists view anarcho communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society 65  66  67  To date in human history  the best known examples of an anarchist communist society  established around the ideas as they exist today  that received worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon  are the anarchist territories during the Spanish Revolution and the Free Territory during the Russian Revolution  Through the efforts and influence of the Spanish Anarchists during the Spanish Revolution within the Spanish Civil War  starting in 1936 anarchist communism existed in most of Aragon  parts of the Levante and Andalusia  as well as in the stronghold of Anarchist Catalonia before being brutally crushed by the combined forces of the authoritarian regime that won the war  Hitler  Mussolini  Spanish Communist Party repression  backed by the USSR  as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself  During the Russian Revolution  anarchists such as Nestor Makhno worked to create and defend through the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine anarchist communism in the Free Territory of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1921  Christian communism This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Christian communism is a form of religious communism centred on Christianity  It is a theological and political theory based upon the view that the teachings of Jesus Christ urge Christians to support communism as the ideal social system  Christian communists trace the origins of their practice to teachings in the New Testament  such as this one from Acts of the Apostles at chapter 2 and verses 42  44  and 45  42And they continued steadfastly in the apostles  doctrine and in fellowship     44And all that believed were together  and had all things in common  45And sold their possessions and goods  and parted them to all men  as every man had need   King James Version Christian communism can be seen as a radical form of Christian socialism  Also  because many Christian communists have formed independent stateless communes in the past  there is also a link between Christian communism and Christian anarchism  Christian communists may not agree with various parts of Marxism  but they share some of the political goals of Marxists  for example replacing capitalism with socialism  which should in turn be followed by communism at a later point in the future  However  Christian communists sometimes disagree with Marxists  and particularly with Leninists  on the way a socialist or communist society should be organized  Criticisms Victims of Soviet NKVD in Lviv  June 1941  Main articles  Criticisms of communism  Anti communism  and Mass killings under Communist regimes See also Criticisms of Marxism and Criticisms of socialism for a discussion of objections to socialism in general  Some people have criticised socialism and by extension communism  stating that the two systems have distorted or absent price signals  68  69  slow or stagnant technological advance  70  reduced incentives  71  72  73  reduced prosperity  74  75  feasibility  68  69  70  and its social and political effects  76  77  78  79  80  81  Part of this criticism extends to the policies adopted by one party states ruled by communist parties  known as  communist states    Some scholars are specially focused on their human rights records which are claimed to be responsible for famines  purges and warfare resulting in deaths far in excess of previous empires  capitalist or other regimes  82  83  84  The Council of Europe in Resolution 1481 and international declarations such as the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism and the Declaration on Crimes of Communism have condemned some of the actions that resulted in these deaths as crimes  St phane Courtois argues that Communism and National Socialism are slightly different totalitarian systems citation needed   and that communism is responsible for the murder of almost 100 million people in the 20th century  85  but two of the main Black Book s contributors  Nicolas Werth and Jean Louis Margolin  disagreed and publicly disassociated themselves from Courtois s statements  86  References   Critique of the Gotha Programme  Karl Marx
