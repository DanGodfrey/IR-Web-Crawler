 The conch style is represented in Pensacola  Florida  adorning houses with balconies of wrought iron  as appears in the mostly Spanish built French Quarter of New Orleans  Louisiana  Fires in 1788 and 1794 destroyed the original French structures in New Orleans  Many of the city s present buildings date to late 18th century rebuilding efforts  The earliest continuously occupied European settlement in the United States is either St  Augustine  Florida founded in 1565  or Santa Fe  New Mexico The Castillo de San Marcos fort 1672 1695 is St  Augustine s oldest surviving structure  It

culture and architecture of the Pueblo people  The Pueblo people built dwellings of adobe  a sun dried clay brick  with exposed wooden ceiling beams  Their cubic form and dense arrangement gave villages a singular aspect  The modest unadorned structures remained constant and cool  The Spanish conquered these pueblos and made Pueblo de Santa Fe the administrative capital of the Santa Fe de Nuevo M xico Province in 1609  The Palace of the Governors was built between 1610 and 1614  mixing Pueblo Indian and Spanish influences  The building is long and has a patio  The Mission San Francisco

the entrance is flanked by estipites   edit  California Main article  Architecture of the California missions See also  Spanish missions in California In the late 18th century  the Spanish founded a series of presidios  forts  in the upper Las Californias Province to resist Russian and British colonization there  the Presidio of San Diego  Presidio of Santa Barbara  Presidio of Monterey  and Presidio of San Francisco were established for this and to support the occupation by new missions and settlements  From 1769 to 1823  the Franciscans created a linear network of twenty one Missions in California  The missions had a significant influence on later regional architecture  An example of a period residence is the Casa de la Guerra  in Santa Barbara   edit  English influences The 1686 Jethro Coffin House on Nantucket  Massachusetts  illustrating the  saltbox  form characteristic of New England  Further information  British colonization of the Americas Excavations at the first permanent English speaking settlement  Jamestown  Virginia  founded 1607  have unearthed part of the triangular James Fort and numerous artifacts from the early 17th century  Nearby Williamsburg was Virginia s colonial capital and is now a tourist attraction as a well preserved 18th century town  The New World population of 200 000 in 1657  ninety percent of whom drew from England  used the same simple construction techniques as those in their respective mother countries  4  These settlers often came to the New World for economic purposes  therefore revealing why most early homes reflect the influences of modest village homes and small farms  The appearance of structures was very plain and made with little imported material  Windows  for example  were extremely small  The size did not increase until long after even the British were manufacturing glass  This was because the Venetians had not rediscovered the strictly Roman clear glass until the 15th century and it did not come to England until another hundred years later  5  The few windows that did exist on early colonial homes had small panes held together by a lead framework  much like a typical church s stained glass window  The glass that was used was imported from England and was incredibly expensive  6  In the 18th century  many of these houses were restored and sash windows replaced the originals  These were invented by Robert Hooke  1635 1703  and were made so that one panel of glass easily slid up  vertically  behind another  7  St  Luke s Episcopal Church in Smithfield  Virginia  thought to be the oldest surviving brick church in the English Colonies of what would become the United States  dating to the mid late 17th century  Timber  especially white and red cedar  made for a great building resource and was readily abundant for the settlers in America  so  naturally many houses were made of wood  8  As for decorative elements  there were very few notable efforts made to show creativity with the early colonial homes  and if an effort was made  it led to a very simple outcome  A subtle element of ornamentation was made on the front door  The owner would take nails  think of an object or pattern to make with them  and nail that decoration onto the door  The more nails one had  the more extravagant and elaborate the pattern could become  9  The prize architectural aspect of the house was the chimney  Large and usually made of brick or stone  the chimney was very fashionable at this time  1600 1715  approximately  During the Tudor period in England  which lasted up until around 1603  coal became the popular material for heating the home  Before that  a wood fire was burned on the floor in the center of the house  with the smoke escaping only through windows and vents  With coal  this method could not suffice because the smoke was unacceptably black and sticky  It needed to be contained and the function of a chimney was to do just that  6  The oldest remaining building of Plymouth  Massachusetts is the Harlow House built 1677 and now a museum  The Fairbanks House  ca  1636  in Dedham  Massachusetts is the oldest remaining wood frame house in North America  Several notable colonial era buildings remain in Boston  Boston s Old North Church  built 1723 in the style of Sir Christopher Wren  became an influential model for later United States church design   edit  Georgian architecture Carpenters  Hall  Philadelphia  Pennsylvania  Main article  Georgian architecture The Georgian style appeared during the 18th century and Palladian architecture took hold of colonial Williamsburg in the Colony of Virginia  The Governor s Palace there  built in 1706 1720  has a vast gabled entrance at the front  It respects the principle of symmetry and uses the materials that were found in the Tidewater region of the Mid Atlantic colonies  red brick  white painted wood  and blue slate used for the roof with a double slant  This style is used to build the houses for prosperous plantation owners in the country and wealthy merchants in town  In religious architecture  the common design features were brick  stone like stucco  and a single spire that tops the entrance  They can be seen in Saint Paul s Church  1761  in Mount Vernon  New York or Saint Paul s Chapel  1766  in New York  New York  The architects of this period were more influenced by the canons of Old World architecture  Peter Harrison  1716 1755  used his European techniques in designing the Redwood Library and Athenaeum  1748 and 1761   in Newport  Rhode Island and now the oldest community library still occupying its original building in the United States  Boston and Salem in the Massachusetts Bay Colony were two primary cities where the Georgian style took hold  but in a simpler style than in England  adapted to the colonial limitations  The Georgian style predominated residential design in the British colonial era in the thirteen Colonies  At the Mount Pleasant mansion  1761 1762  in Philadelphia  the residence is constructed with an entrance topped by a pediment supported by Doric columns  The roof has a balustrade and a symmetrical arrangement  characteristic of the neoclassic style popular in Europe then   edit  Architecture for a new nation In 1776  the members of the Continental Congress issued the Declaration of Independence of the Thirteen Colonies  After the long and distressing American Revolutionary War the 1783 Treaty of Paris recognized the existence of the new republic  the United States of America  Even though it was a firm break with the English politically  the Georgian influences continued to mark the buildings constructed  Public and commercial needs grew in parallel with the territorial extension  The buildings of these new federal and business institutions used the classic vocabulary of columns  domes and pediments  in some referencing to ancient Rome and Greece  Architectural publications multiplied  in 1797  Asher Benjamin published The Country Builder s Assistant  Americans looked to affirm their independence in the domains of politics  economics  and culture with new civic architecture for government  religion  and education   edit  Federal architecture Main article  Federal architecture Massachusetts State House  Boston  Massachusetts  1795 1798  See also  Adam style In the 1780s  the Federal style began to diverge bit by bit from the Georgian style and became a uniquely American genre  At the time of the War of Independence  houses stretched out along a strictly rectangular plan  adopting curved lines and favoring the decorative details such as garlands and urns  Certain openings were ellipsoidal in form  one or several pieces were oval or circular  The Bostonian architect Charles Bulfinch fitted the Massachusetts State House  in 1795 1798 with an original gilded dome  He worked on the construction of several houses in Louisburg Square of the Beacon Hill quarter in Boston  Samuel McIntire designed the John Gardiner Pingree house  1805  in Salem  Massachusetts with a gentle sloped roof and brick balustrade  With Palladio as inspiration  he linked the buildings with a semi circular column supported portico  The Federal style was popular along the Atlantic coast from 1780 to 1830  Characteristics of the federal style include neoclassical elements  bright interiors with large windows and white walls and ceilings  and a decorative yet restrained appearance that emphasized rational elements  Significant federal style architects at the time include  Asher Benjamin  Charles Bulfinch  Samuel McIntire  Alexander Parris  and William Thornton   edit  Thomas Jefferson Plan  ca  1819  for the Rotunda of the University of Virginia  based on the Pantheon in Rome  Main article  Jeffersonian architecture Thomas Jefferson  who was the third president of the United States between 1801 and 1809  was a scholar in many domains  including architecture  Having journeyed several times in Europe  he hoped to apply the formal rules of palladianism and of antiquity in public and private architecture and master planning  He contributed to the plans for the University of Virginia  which began construction in 1817  The project was completed by Benjamin Latrobe applying Jefferson s architectural concepts  The university library is situated under a The Rotunda covered by a dome inspired by the Pantheon of Rome  The combination created a uniformity thanks to the use of brick and wood painted white  For the new Virginia State Capitol building  1785 1796  in Richmond  Virginia  Jefferson was inspired by the ancient Rome Maison Carr e in N mes  but chose the Ionic order for its columns  A man of the Age of Enlightenment  Thomas Jefferson had participated in the emancipation of New World architecture by expressing his vision of an art form in service of democracy  He contributed to developing the Federal style in his country and adapting European Neoclassical architecture to American democracy  Thomas Jefferson also designed the buildings for his plantation Monticello  near Charlottesville  Virginia  It s an example of the Neo Palladian style  with the H tel de Salm in Paris  that Jefferson saw when ambassador to France  as a model  Work commenced in 1768 and modifications continued until 1809  This American variation on Palladian architecture borrowed from British and Irish models and revived the tetrastyle portico with Doric columns  This interest in Roman elements appealed in a political climate that looked to the ancient Roman Republic as a model  edit  New capital city Further information  Neoclassical architecture Early buildings of the U S  Federal Government in Washington  D C  Study of the south facade of the White House  ca  1817   note the presence of central stairs and the absence of the Truman Balcony   United States Capitol  Washington  D C   rebuilt 1815 1830  as it appeared during the early 19th century  prior to expansions and reconstruction of the dome   The United States Capitol in Washington  D C  is an example of uniform urbanism  the design of the capitol building was imagined by the French Pierre Charles L Enfant  This ideal of the monumental city and neoclassicism   Several cities wanted to apply this concept  which is part of the    but Washington  D C  seems the most dedicated of all of them  The White House was constructed after the creation of Washington  D C  by congressional law in December 1790  After a contest  James Hoban  an Irish American  was chosen and the construction began in October 1792  The building that he had conceived was modeled upon the first and second floors of the Leinster House  a ducal palace in Dublin  Ireland which is now the seat of the Irish Parliament  But during the War of 1812  a large part of the city was burned  and the White House was ravaged  Only the exterior walls remained standing  but it was reconstructed  The walls were painted white to hide the damage caused by the fire  At the beginning of the 20th century  two new wings were added to support the development of the government  The United States Capitol was constructed in successive stages starting in 1792  Shortly after the completion of its construction  it was partially burned by the British during the War of 1812  Its reconstruction began in 1815 and did not end until 1830  During the 1850s  the building was greatly expanded by Thomas U  Walter  In 1863  the imposing Statue of Freedom   was placed on the top of the current  new at the time  dome  The Washington Monument is an Obelisk memorial erected in honor of George Washington  the first American President  It was Robert Mills who had designed it originally in 1838  There is a perceivable color difference towards the bottom of the monument  which is because its construction was put on hiatus for lack of money  At 555 5 feet  169 3 m  high  it was completed in 1884 and opened to the public in 1888   edit  Frontier vernacular A sod house  1901  See also  Sod house and Log cabin Further information  Vernacular architecture The Homestead Act of 1862 brought property ownership within reach for millions of citizens  displaced native peoples  and changed the character of settlement patterns across the Great Plains and Southwest  The law offered a modest farm free of charge to any adult male who cultivated the land for five years and built a residence on the property  This established a rural pattern of isolated farmsteads in the Midwest and West instead of the European and eastern U S  states  villages and towns  Settlers built homes from local materials  such as rustic sod  semi cut stone  mortared cobble  adobe bricks  and rough logs  They erected log cabins in forested areas and sod houses  such as the Sod House  Cleo Springs  Oklahoma   in treeless prairies  The present day sustainable architecture method of Straw bale construction was pioneered in late 19th century Nebraska with baling machines  The Spanish and later Mexican Alta California Ranchos and early American pioneers used the readily available clay to make adobe bricks  and distant forests  tree trunks for beams sparingly  Locally made roof tiles were produced by the Mission Indians  As milled wood became more available in the mid 19th century the Monterey Colonial architecture style first developed in Monterey and then spread  The Leonis Adobe  Larkin House  and Rancho Petaluma Adobe are original examples   edit  Mid 19th Century See also  Revivalism  architecture   edit  Greek Revival See also  Greek Revival Greek revival style attracted American architects working in the first half of the 19th century  The young nation  free from Britannic protection  was persuaded to be the new Athens  that is to say  a foyer for democracy  Benjamin Latrobe  1764 1820  and his students William Strickland  1788 1854  and Robert Mills  1781 1855  obtained commissions to build some banks and churches in the big cities  Philadelphia  Baltimore and Washington  DC   Some state capitol buildings adopted the Greek Revival style such as in North Carolina  Capitol building in Raleigh  rebuilt in 1833 1840 after a fire  or in Indiana  Capitol building in Indianapolis   One later example of these is the Ohio State Capitol in Columbus  designed by Henry Walters and completed in 1861  The simple fa ade  continuous cornice and the absence of a dome give the impression of the austerity and greatness of the building  It has a very symmetrical design and houses the Supreme Court and a library  A rare style also was adopted around this time  Egyptian Revival architecture  Exemplary Greek Revival Buildings The Fireproof Building  Charleston  South Carolina  by Robert Mills New York

architecture  edit  Gothic Revival See also  Gothic Revival architecture and Carpenter Gothic From the 1840s on  the Gothic Revival style became popular in the United States  under the influence of Andrew Jackson Downing  1815 1852   He defined himself in a reactionary context to classicism and development of romanticism  His work is characterized by a return to Medieval decor  chimneys  gables  embrasure towers  warhead windows  gargoyles  stained glass and severely sloped roofs  The buildings adopted a complex design that drew inspiration from symmetry and neoclassicism  The great families of the east coast had immense estates and villas constructed in the style  with antipodes of Neoclassicism  Some took Horace Walpole s Strawberry Hill House as a model  Alexander Jackson Davis  1803 1892  worked on villa projects in the Hudson River Valley and used details from the Gothic to Baroque repertoire  For the Jay Gould estate country house  Lyndhurst  in Tarrytown  New York  Alexander Jackson Davis designed a building with a complex asymmetrical outline  and opened the double height art gallery with stained glass windows  New York City is home to James Renwick Jr s Saint Patrick Cathedral  an elegant synthesis of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Reims and the Cologne Cathedral  The project was entrusted to him in 1858 but completed by the erection of two spires on the facade in 1888  The use of materials lighter than stone allowed to pass from flying buttresses to exterior buttresses  Renwick also showed his talent in Washington  D C  with the construction of the Smithsonian Institution  But his critics reproached him for having broken the architectural harmony of the capital by building an eccentric combination in red brick using Byzantine  Romanesque  Lombard  and eclectic themes  Richard Upjohn  1802 1878  specialized in the rural churches of the northeast  but his major work is still  Trinity Church  in New York  His red sandstone architecture makes reference to the 16th century forms in Europe  The Gothic Revival style was also used in the construction of universities  Yale  Harvard  and churches  The success of the Gothic Revival was prolonged up until the beginning of the 20th century in numerous Skyscrapers  notably in Chicago and in New York  Gothic Revival across functions Residential   Lyndhurst   by Alexander Jackson Davis in Tarrytown  New

that style  See also  Queen Anne Style architecture  United States   Romanesque Revival architecture  Richardsonian Romanesque  and Shingle Style architecture Further information  Victorian architecture Following the American Civil War and through the turn of the 20th century  a number of related styles  trends  and movements emerged  are loosely and broadly categorized as  Victorian   due to their correspondence with similar movements of the time in the British Empire during the later reign of Queen Victoria  Many architects working during this period would cross various modes  depending on the commission  Key influential American architects of the period include Richard Morris Hunt  Frank Furness  and Henry Hobson Richardson  After the war  the uniquely American Stick Style developed as a of construction that uses wooden rod trusswork  the origin of its name  The style was commonly used in houses  hotels  railway depots  and other structures primarily of wood  The buildings are topped by high roofs with steep slopes and prominent decoration of the gables  The exterior is not bare of decoration  even though the main objective remains comfort  Richard Morris Hunt constructed John N  Griswold s house in Newport  Rhode Island in 1862 in this style  The  Stick Style  was progressively abandoned after c  1873  gradually evolving into the Queen Anne Style  On the west coast in California  domestic architecture evolved equally towards a more modern style  San Francisco has many representations of the Italianate  Stick Eastlake  and Queen Anne styles of Victorian architecture  c  1850s 1900  Constructed with Redwood lumber they resisted the 1906 San Francisco earthquake itself  though some burned in the aftermath  They introduced the contemporary services of central heating and electricity  The Carson Mansion conceived of by Builder Architects  Samuel and Joseph Cather Newsom and built by an army of over 100 craftsman from the massive lumber operations of its owner  is prominently situated at the head of Old Town Eureka  California on Humboldt Bay  It is widely regarded as one of the highest executions of Queen Anne style in California and the United States  On the east coast the Queen Anne evolved into the Shingle Style architecture  It is characterized by attention to a more relaxed rustic image  Richardson designed the William Watts Sherman House  1874 1875  in Newport  Rhode Island  and the Mary Fiske Stoughton House  1882 1883  in Cambridge  Massachusetts  and Charles Follen McKim the Newport Casino  1879 1881  using shingle clad asymmetrical facades  While medieval influence rode high  in the second half of the 19th century  architects also responded to commissions for estate scale residences with Renaissance Revival residences  Industry and commerce tycoons invested in stone and commissioned mansions replicating European palaces  The Biltmore Estate near to Asheville  North Carolina is in the Ch teauesque style of French Renaissance Revival  and is the largest private residence in the U S  Richard Morris Hunt interpreted the Louis XII and Fran ois I wings from the Ch teau de Blois for it   edit  Rise of the skyscraper Chicago s Home Insurance Building  the world s first steel framed skyscraper  erected in 1885  Main articles  Chicago school  architecture  and skyscraper The most notable United States architectural innovation has been the skyscraper  Several technical advances made this possible  In 1853 Elisha Otis invented the first safety elevator which prevented a car from falling down the shaft if the suspending cable broke  Elevators allowed buildings to rise above the four or five stories that people were willing to climb by stairs for normal occupancy  An 1868 competition decided the design of New York City s six story Equitable Life Building  which would become the first commercial building to use an elevator  Construction commenced in 1873  Other structures followed such as the Auditorium Building  Chicago in 1885 by Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan  This adopted Italian palazzo design details to give the appearance of a structured whole  for several decades American skyscrapers would blend conservative decorative elements with technical innovation  Soon skyscrapers encountered a new technological challenge  Load bearing stone walls become impractical as a structure gains height  reaching a technical limit at about 20 stories  culminating in the 1891 Monadnock Building by Burnham  amp  Root in Chicago   Professional engineer William LeBaron Jenney solved the problem with a steel support frame in Chicago s 10 story Home Insurance Building  1885  Arguably this is the first true skyscraper  The use of a thin curtain wall in place of a load bearing wall reduced the building s overall weight by two thirds  Another feature that was to become familiar in 20th century skyscrapers first appeared in Chicago s Reliance Building  designed by Charles B  Atwood and E C  Shankland  Chicago  1890   1895  Because outer walls no longer bore the weight of a building it was possible to increase window size  This became the first skyscraper to have plate glass windows take up a majority of its outer surface area  Some of the most graceful early towers were designed by Louis Sullivan  1856 1924   America s first great modern architect  His most talented student was Frank Lloyd Wright  1867 1959   who spent much of his career designing private residences with matching furniture and generous use of open space   edit  Beaux Arts and the American Renaissance World s Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago  Illinois  Main articles  Beaux Arts architecture  American Renaissance  and City Beautiful Daniel Burnham s  White City  of the World s Columbian Exposition of 1893  held in Chicago  Illinois  ceremonially marks the dawn of the golden age for the Beaux Arts style  and larger firms such as McKim  Mead and White  The era is documented in photo architectural albums such as the Architectural photographic series of Albert Levy  10  The Columbian Exposition also reflected the rise of American landscape architecture and city planning  Notable were the works of Frederick Law Olmsted  an already prominent and prolific landscape architect who had designed the Midway Plaisance of the 1893 Exhibition  having previously designed New York s Central Park in the 1850s  the layout of the National Zoo in Washington  D C   and many other works nationwide  Olmsted and his sons were also involved in the City Beautiful movement  which  as its name suggests  sought to aesthetically  and thus culturally  transform cities  The aspirations of the movement can be seen in the McMillan Plan for Washington  D C   As the century progressed  the Beaux Arts influence would become somewhat more restrained  returning to its more Neoclassical roots  The Lincoln Memorial  1915 1922   made out of marble and white limestone  takes its form from doric order Greek temples without a pediment  Its architect  Henry Bacon  student of the ideas from the Beaux Arts school  intended the 36 columns of monument to represent each of the 36 states in the Union at the time of Lincoln s death  The Jefferson Memorial was the last great monument constructed in the Beaux Arts tradition  in the 1940s  Its architect  John Russell Pope  wanted to bring to light Jefferson s taste for Roman buildings  This is why he decided to imitate the Pantheon in Rome and grace the building with a similar type dome  It was severely criticized by the proponents of the International Style   edit  Early suburbs  1890 1930  With the boom in the use of electric streetcars  the inner ring of suburbs developed around major cities  later to be aided by the advent of bicycles and automobiles  This boom in construction would result in a new  distinctly American form of house would emerge  the American Foursquare   edit  Arts and Crafts Movement The

The trend of reviving previous styles continued over from the 19th century  Many of the revivals beginning in the late 19th century on into the 20th century would focus more on regional characteristics and earlier styles endemic to the United States and eclectically from abroad  further influenced by the rise of middle class tourism   edit  Mediterranean revival Main article  Mediterranean Revival architecture The early 20th century saw Mediterranean Revival style architecture enter the large estate design vocabulary  A major and significant example is the Hearst Castle on the Central Coast of California  designed by architect Julia Morgan  The San Francisco Bay Area estate Filoli  by Willis Polk  is in Woodside  California with the mansion and gardens now part of the National Trust for Historic Preservation and open to the public  the Dumbarton Oaks estate  in Georgetown  Washington  D C   has Italian Renaissance gardens by early landscape architect Beatrix

extensive gardens by a leading estate Landscape designer in that era  A E  Hanson   edit  Spanish Colonial revival Main articles  Mission Revival Style architecture and Spanish Colonial Revival architecture The 1915 Panama California Exposition the architecture by Bertram Goodhue and Carleton Winslow Sr  intentionally moved beyond the Mission Revival Style  from their studying Spanish Colonial architecture and its Churrigueresque and Plateresque refinements in Mexico  The project was a popular success  and introduced the Spanish Colonial Revival style to many design professionals and the public in California and across the country  George Washington Smith  based in Montecito and Santa Barbara  designed the detailed and integrated Andalusian Spanish Colonial Revival Casa del Herrero estate in 1926  Smith  Bertram Goodhue  Wallace Neff  and other notable architects created many  Country Place Era  properties throughout California during this period  A civic example is the
