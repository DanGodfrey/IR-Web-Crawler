originating from the United States of America  European colonization of the Americas yielded the introduction of a number of ingredients and cooking styles to the latter  The various styles continued expanding well in to the 19th and 20th centuries  proportional to the influx of immigrants from many foreign nations  such influx developed a rich diversity in food preparation throughout the country

edit  History  edit  Seafood Saltwater fish eaten by the American Indians were cod  lemon sole  flounder  herring  halibut  sturgeon  smelt  drum on the East Coast  and olachen and salmon on the West Coast  Whale was hunted by American Indians off the Northwest coast  especially by the Makah  and used for their meat and oil  1  Seal and walrus were also utilized  Eel from New York s Finger Lakes region were eaten  Catfish seemed to be favored by tribes  including the Modocs  Crustacean included shrimp  lobster  crayfish  and dungeness crabs in the Northwest and blue crabs in the East  Other shellfish include abalone and geoduck on the California coast  while on the East Coast the surf clam  quahog  and the soft shell clam  Oysters were eaten on both shores  as were mussels and periwinkles  2   edit  Cooking methods Blue crab was used on the eastern and southern coast of what is now the U S  mainland  Early Native Americans utilized a number of cooking methods in early American Cuisine  that have been blended with early European cooking methods to form the basis of American Cuisine  Grilling meats was common  Spit roasting over a pit fire was common as well  Vegetables  especially root vegetables were often cooked directly in the ashes of the fire  As early American Indians lacked the proper pottery that could be used directly over a fire  they developed a technique which has caused many anthropologists to call them  Stone Boilers   They would heat rocks directly in a fire and then add the bricks to a pot filled with water until it came to a boil so that it would cook the meat or vegetables in the boiling water  In what is now the Southwestern United States  they also created ovens made of adobe called hornos in which to bake items such as breads made from cornmeal and in other parts of America  made ovens out of dug pits  These pits were also used to steam foods by adding heated rocks or embers and then seaweed or corn husks  or other coverings  placed on top to steam fish and shellfish as well as vegetables  potatoes would be added while still in skin and corn while in husk  this would later be referred to as a clambake by the colonists  3   edit  Colonial period Main article  Cuisine of the Thirteen Colonies Map of the 13 American Colonies in 1775  When the colonists came to America  their initial attempts at survival included planting crops familiar to them from back home in England  In the same way  they farmed animals for clothing and meat in a similar fashion  Through hardships and eventual establishment of trade with Britain  the West Indies and other regions  the colonists were able to establish themselves in the American colonies with a cuisine similar to their previous British cuisine  There were some exceptions to the diet  such as local vegetation and animals  but the colonists attempted to use these items in the same fashion as they had their equivalents or ignore them if they could  The manner of cooking for the American colonists followed along the line of British cookery up until the Revolution  The British sentiment followed in the cookbooks brought to the New World as well  4  There was a general disdain for French cookery  even with the French Huguenots in South Carolina and French Canadians  One of the cookbooks that proliferated in the colonies was The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy written by Hannah Glasse  wrote of disdain for the French style of cookery  stating  the blind folly of this age that would rather be imposed on by a French booby  than give encouragement to a good English cook   Of the French recipes  she does add to the text she speaks out flagrantly against the dishes as she    think it an odd jumble of trash   5  Reinforcing the anti French sentiment was the French and Indian War from 1754 1764  This created a large anxiety against the French  which influenced the English to either deport many of the French  or as in the case of the Acadians  they migrated to Louisiana  The Acadian French did create a large French influence in the diet of those settled in Louisiana  but had little or no influence outside of Louisiana  6   edit  Common ingredients The American colonial diet varied depending on the settled region in which someone lived  Local cuisine patterns had established by the mid 18th century  The New England colonies were extremely similar in their dietary habits to those that many of them had brought from England  A striking difference for the colonists in New England compared to other regions was seasonality  7  While in the southern colonies  they could farm almost year round  in the northern colonies  the growing seasons were very restricted  In addition  colonists  close proximity to the ocean gave them a bounty of fresh fish to add to their diet  especially in the northern colonies  Wheat  however  the grain used to bake bread back in England was almost impossible to grow  and imports of wheat were far from cost productive  8  Substitutes in cases such as this included cornmeal  The Johnnycake was a poor substitute to some for wheaten bread  but acceptance by both the northern and southern colonies seems evident  9  As many of the New Englanders were originally from England game hunting was often a pastime from back home that paid off when they immigrated to the New World  Much of the northern colonists depended upon the ability either of themselves to hunt  or for others from which they could purchase game  This was the preferred method for protein consumption over animal husbandry  as it required much more work to defend the kept animals against American Indians or the French   edit  Livestock and game Commonly hunted and eaten game included deer  bear  buffalo and wild turkey  The larger muscles of the animals were roasted and served with currant sauce  while the other smaller portions went into soups  stews  sausages  pies  and pasties  10  In addition to game  colonists  protein intake was supplemented by mutton  The Spanish in Florida originally introduced sheep to the New World  but this development never quite reached the North  and there they were introduced by the Dutch and English  The keeping of sheep was a result of the English non practice of animal husbandry  11  The animals provided wool when young and mutton upon maturity after wool production was no longer desirable  12  The forage based diet for sheep that prevailed in the Colonies produced a characteristically strong  gamy flavor and a tougher consistency  which required aging and slow cooking to tenderize  13   edit  Fats and oils A number of fats and oils made from animals served to cook much of the colonial foods  Many homes had a sack made of deerskin filled with bear oil for cooking  while solidified bear fat resembled shortening  Rendered pork fat made the most popular cooking medium  especially from the cooking of bacon  Pork fat was used more often in the southern colonies than the northern colonies as the Spanish introduced pigs earlier to the South  The colonists enjoyed butter in cooking as well  but it was rare prior to the American Revolution  as cattle were not yet plentiful  14   edit  Seafood Fish and fries served with coleslaw in the United States  The American lobster was a staple of the colonial diet  Those living near the New England shore often dined on fish  crustaceans  and other animals that originated in the waters  Colonists ate large quantities of turtle  and it was an exportable delicacy for Europe  Cod  in both fresh and salted form was enjoyed  with the salted variation created for long storage  The highest quality cod was usually dried  however  and exported to the Mediterranean in exchange for fruits not available in the American colonies  15  Lobsters proliferated in the waters as well  and were extremely common in the New England diet   edit  Alcoholic drinks Prior to the Revolution  New Englanders consumed large quantities of rum and beer  as maritime trade provided them relatively easy access to the goods needed to produce these items  Rum was the distilled spirit of choice  as the main ingredient  molasses  was readily available from trade with the West Indies  Further into the interior  however  one would often find colonists consuming whiskey  as they did not have similar access to sugar cane  They did have ready access to corn and rye  which they used to produce their whiskey  16  However  until the Revolution  many considered whiskey to be a coarse alcohol unfit for human consumption  as many believed that it caused the poor to become raucous and unkempt drunkards  17  In addition to these alcohol based products produced in America  imports were seen on merchant shelves  including wine and brandy  18   edit  Southern variations In comparison to the northern colonies  the southern colonies were quite diverse in their agricultural diet and did not have a central region of culture  The uplands and the lowlands made up the two main parts of the southern colonies  The slaves and poor of the south often ate a similar diet  which consisted of many of the indigenous New World crops  Salted or smoked pork often supplement the vegetable diet  Rural poor often ate squirrel  possum  rabbit and other woodland animals  Those on the  rice coast  often ate ample amounts of rice  while the grain for the rest of the southern poor and slaves was cornmeal used in breads and porridges  Wheat was not an option for most of those that lived in the southern colonies  19  The diet of the uplands often included cabbage  string beans  white potatoes  while most avoided sweet potatoes and peanuts  Non poor whites in the uplands avoided crops imported from Africa because of the perceived inferiority of crops of the African slaves  Those who could grow or afford wheat often had biscuits as part of their breakfast  along with healthy portions of pork  Salted pork was a staple of any meal  as it was used in the preparations of vegetables for flavor  in addition to its direct consumption as a protein  20  The lowlands  which included much of the Acadian French regions of Louisiana and the surrounding area  included a varied diet heavily influenced by Africans and Caribbeans  rather than just the French  As such  rice played a large part of the diet as it played a large part of the diets of the Africans and Caribbean  In addition  unlike the uplands  the lowlands subsistence of protein came mostly from coastal seafood and game meats  Much of the diet involved the use of peppers  as it still does today  21  Interestingly  although the English had an inherent disdain for French foodways  as well as many of the native foodstuff of the colonies  the French had no such disdain for the indigenous foodstuffs  In fact  they had a vast appreciation for the native ingredients and dishes  22   edit  20th century 21st century Some corporate kitchens  for example  General Mills  Campbell s  Kraft Foods  develop consumer recipes  One characteristic of American cooking is the fusion of multiple ethnic or regional approaches into completely new cooking styles  Asian cooking has played a particularly large role in American fusion cuisine  23  Similarly  while some dishes that are typically considered American have their origins in other countries  American cooks and chefs have substantially altered these dishes over the years  to the degree that the dishes now enjoyed the world over are considered to be American  Hot dogs and hamburgers are both based on traditional German dishes  brought over to America by German immigrants to the United States  but in their modern popular form they can be reasonably considered American dishes  24  Many companies in the American food industry develop new products requiring minimal preparation  such as frozen entrees  25  Many of these recipes have become very popular  For example  the General Mills Betty Crocker s Cookbook  first published in 1950 and currently in its 10th edition  26  is commonly found in American homes  27  Pre packaged American meals tend to be high in carbohydrates  fat  sodium  and various preservatives  However  they also tend to be vitamin fortified  Examples of pre packed American meals include various casserole type dishes such as Hamburger Helper  as well as bakeable and microwaveable foods such as Hot Pockets  frozen pizzas  frozen burritos  and various types of TV dinner meals  A wave of celebrity chefs began perhaps with Julia Child in the 1980s  with many more following after the rise of cable channels like Food Network  Trendy food items in the 2000s and 2010s  albeit with long traditions  include cupcakes  macaroons  and meatballs  28   edit  Regional cuisine Main article  List of American regional and fusion cuisines Given the United States  large size it has numerous regional variations  The United States  regional cuisine is characterized by its extreme diversity and style with each region having its own distinctive cuisine   edit  New England Main article  Cuisine of New England New England clam chowder New England is a Northeastern region of the United States  including the six states of Connecticut  Maine  Massachusetts  New Hampshire  Rhode Island  and Vermont  The American Indians cuisine became part of the cookery style that the early colonists brought with them  citation needed  The style of New England cookery originated from its colonial roots  that is to say practical  frugal and willing to eat anything other than what they were used to from their British roots  29  Much of the cuisine started with one pot cookery  which resulted in such dishes as succotash  chowder  baked beans  and others  30  Lobster is an integral ingredient to the cuisine  indigenous to the coastal waters of the region  Other shellfish of the coastal regions include little neck clams  sea scallops  blue mussels  oysters  soft shell clams and razor shell clams  Much of this shellfish contributes to New England tradition  the clambake  The clambake as known today is a colonial interpretation of an American Indian tradition  31  The fruits of the region include the Vitis labrusca grapes used in grape juice made by companies such as Welch s  along with jelly  Kosher wine by companies like Mogen David and Manischewitz along with other wineries that make higher quality wines  Apples from New England include the original varieties  Baldwin  Lady  Mother  Pomme Grise  Porter  Roxbury Russet  Wright  Sops of Wine  Peck s Pleasant  Titus Pippin  Westfield Seek No Further  and Duchess of Oldenburg  Cranberries are another fruit indigenous to the region  32   edit  Pacific and Hawaiian

reflects the nation s changing diversity as well as its development over time  According to the National Restaurant Association  Restaurant industry sales are expected to reach a record high of  476 billion in 2005  an increase of 4 9 percent over 2004    Driven by consumer demand  the ethnic food market reached record sales in 2002  and has emerged as the fastest growing category in the food and beverage product sector  according to USBX Advisory Services  Minorities in the U S  spend a combined  142 billion on food and by 2010  America s ethnic population is expected to grow by 40 percent  33  A movement began during the 1980s among popular leading chefs to reclaim America s ethnic foods within its regional traditions  where these trends originated  One of the earliest was Paul Prudhomme  who in 1984 began the introduction of his influential cookbook  Paul Prodhomme s Louisiana Kitchen  by describing the over 200 year history of Creole and Cajun cooking  he aims to  preserve and expand the Louisiana tradition   34  Prodhomme s success quickly inspired other chefs  Norman Van Aken embraced a Floridian type cuisine fused with many ethnic and globalized elements in his Feast of Sunlight cookbook in 1988  The movement finally gained fame around the world when California became swept up in the movement  then seemingly started to lead the trend itself  in  for example  the popular restaurant Chez Panisse in Berkeley  Examples of the Chez Panisse phenomenon  chefs who embraced a new globalized cuisine  were celebrity chefs like Jeremiah Tower and Wolfgang Puck  both former colleagues at the restaurant  Puck went on to describe his belief in contemporary  new style American cuisine in the introduction to The Wolfgang Puck Cookbook  Another major breakthrough  whose originators were once thought to be crazy  is the mixing of ethnic cuisines  It is not at all uncommon to find raw fish listed next to tortillas on the same menu  Ethnic crossovers also occur when distinct elements meet in a single recipe  This country is  after all  a huge melting pot  Why should its cooking not illustrate the American transformation of diversity into unity  35  Puck s former colleague  Jeremiah Tower became synonymous with California Cuisine and the overall American culinary revolution  Meanwhile  the restaurant that inspired both Puck and Tower became a distinguished establishment  popularizing its so called  mantra  in its book by Paul Bertolli and owner Alice Waters  Chez Panisse Cooking  in 1988  Published well after the restaurants  founding in 1971  this new cookbook from the restaurant seemed to perfect the idea and philosophy that had developed over the years  The book embraced America s natural bounty  specifically that of California  while containing recipes that reflected Bertoli and Waters  appreciation of both northern Italian and French style foods   edit  Early ethnic influences While the earliest cuisine of the United States was influenced by indigenous American Indians  the cuisine of the thirteen colonies or the culture of the antebellum American South  the overall culture of the nation  its gastronomy and the growing culinary arts became ever more influenced by its changing ethnic mix and immigrant patterns from the 18th and 19th centuries unto the present  Some of the ethnic groups that continued to influence the cuisine were here in prior years  while others arrived more numerously during  The Great Transatlantic Migration  of 1870 1914  or other mass migrations  Some of the ethnic influences could be found in the nation from after the American Civil War and into the History of United States continental expansion during most of the 19th century  Ethnic influences already in the nation at that time would include the following groups and their respective cuisines  Select nationalities of Europe and the respective developments from early modern European cuisine of the colonial age  British Americans and on going developments in New England cuisine  the national traditions founded in cuisine of the thirteen colonies and some aspects of other regional cuisine  Spanish Americans and early modern Spanish cuisine  as well as Basque Americans and Basque cuisine  Early German American or Pennsylvania Dutch and Pennsylvania Dutch cuisine French Americans and their  New World  regional identities such as  Acadian Cajun and Cajun cuisine Louisiana Creole and Louisiana Creole cuisine  Louisiana Creole  also called French Cr ole  refers to native born people of the New Orleans area who are descended from the Colonial French and or Spanish settlers of Colonial French Louisiana  before it became part of the United States in 1803 with the Louisiana Purchase  The various ethnicities originating from early social factors of Race in the United States and the gastronomy and cuisines of the  New World   Latin American cuisine and North American cuisine  Indigenous American Indians in the United States  Indians  and American Indian cuisine African Americans and  Soul food   Cuisine of Puerto Rico Mexican Americans and Mexican American cuisine  as well as related regional cuisines  Tex Mex  regional Texas and Mexican fusion  Cal Mex  regional California and Mexican fusion  Some aspects of  Southwestern cuisine   Cuisine of New Mexico  edit  Later ethnic and immigrant influence Main article  Immigration to the United States Mass migrations of immigrants to the United States came in several waves  Historians identify several waves of migration to the United States  one from 1815 1860  in which some five million English  Irish  Germanic  Scandinavian  and others from northwestern Europe came to the United States  one from 1865 1890  in which some 10 million immigrants  also mainly from northwestern Europe  settled  and a third from 1890 1914  in which 15 million immigrants  mainly from central  eastern  and southern Europe  many Austrian  Hungarian  Turkish  Lithuanian  Russian  Jewish  Greek  Italian  and Romanian  settled in the United States   2  Together with earlier arrivals to the United States  including the indigenous American Indians  Hispanic and Latino Americans  particularly in the West  Southwest  and Texas  African Americans who came to the United States in the Atlantic slave trade  and early colonial migrants from Britain  France  Germany  and elsewhere  these new waves of immigrants had a pro profound impact on national or regional cuisine  Some of these more prominent groups include the following  Irish Americans   Irish cuisine Italian Americans   Italian American cuisine German Americans   German cuisine  the Pennsylvania Dutch  although descended from Germans  arrived earlier than the bulk of German migrants and have distinct culinary traditions  Scottish Americans   Scottish cuisine Greek Americans   Greek cuisine  Mediterranean cuisine Portuguese Americans   Portuguese cuisine Polish Americans   Polish cuisine  with particular

 the largest ethnic Arab group in the United States    Arab cuisine  Lebanese cuisine  Italian  Mexican and Chinese  Cantonese  cuisines have indeed joined the mainstream  These three cuisines have become so ingrained in the American culture that they are no longer foreign to the American palate  According to the study  more than nine out of 10 consumers are familiar with and have tried these foods  and about half report eating them frequently  The research also indicates that Italian  Mexican and Chinese  Cantonese  have become so adapted to such an extent that  authenticity  is no longer a concern to customers   36  Contributions from these ethnic foods have become as common as traditional  American  fares such as hot dogs  hamburgers  beef steak  which are derived from German cuisine   chicken fried steak  for example  is a variation on German schnitzel   cherry pie  Coca Cola  milkshakes  fried chicken  Fried chicken is of Scottish and African influence  and so on  Nowadays  Americans also have a ubiquitous consumption of foods like pizza and pasta  tacos and burritos to  General Tso s chicken  and fortune cookies  Fascination with these and other ethnic foods may also vary with region   edit  Notable American chefs American chefs have been influential both in the food industry and in popular culture  An important 19th Century American chef was Charles Ranhofer of Delmonico s Restaurant in New York City  American cooking has been exported around the world  both through the global expansion of restaurant chains such as T G I  Friday s and McDonald s and the efforts of individual restaurateurs such as Bob Payton  credited with bringing American style pizza to the UK  37  The first generation of television chefs such as Robert Carrier and Julia Child tended to concentrate on cooking based primarily on European  especially French and Italian  cuisines  Only during the 1970s and 1980s did television chefs such as James Beard and Jeff Smith shift the focus towards home grown cooking styles  particularly those of the different ethnic groups within the nation  Notable American restaurant chefs include Thomas Keller  Charlie Trotter  Grant Achatz  Alfred Portale  Paul Prudhomme  Paul Bertolli  Alice Waters  and celebrity chefs like Mario Batali  Alton Brown  Emeril Lagasse  Cat Cora  Michael Symon  Bobby Flay  Ina Garten  Todd English  Sandra
