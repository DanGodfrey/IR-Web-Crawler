and  A   lava flows side by side at the Big Island of Hawai i in September  2007 N  Pali coast  Kaua i An archipelago situated some 2 000 mi  3 200 km  southwest of the North American mainland  20  Hawaii is the southernmost state of the United States and the second westernmost state after Alaska  Only Hawaii and Alaska do not share a border with another U S  state  Hawaii is the only state of the United States that is not geographically located in North America  grows coffee  is completely surrounded by water  is entirely an archipelago  has royal palaces  and does not have a straight line in its state boundary  Hawaii s tallest mountain  Mauna Kea  stands at 13 796 ft  4 205 m  21  but is taller than Mount Everest if followed to the base of the mountain  which  lying at the floor of the Pacific Ocean  rises about 33 500 ft  10 200 m   22  The eight main islands  Hawai i  Maui  O ahu  Kaho olawe  Lana i  Moloka i  Kaua i and Ni ihau are accompanied by many others  Ka ala is a small island near Ni ihau that is often overlooked  The Northwest Hawaiian Islands are a series of nine small  older masses northwest of Kaua i that extend from Nihoa to Kure that are remnants of once much larger volcanic mountains  There are also more than 100 small rocks and islets  such as Molokini  that are either volcanic  marine sedimentary or erosional in origin  totaling 130 or so across the archipelago  23  Geology All the Hawaiian islands were formed from volcanic activity initiated at an undersea magma source called a hotspot  As the tectonic plate beneath much of the Pacific Ocean moves to the northwest  the hot spot remains stationary  slowly creating new volcanoes  Due to the hotspot s location  the only active volcanoes are located around the southern half of the Big Island  The newest volcano  L  ihi Seamount  is located south of the Big Island s coast  The last volcanic eruption outside the Big Island occurred at Haleakal  on Maui before the late 18th century  though it could have been hundreds of years earlier  24  In 1790  K lauea exploded with the deadliest eruption  of the modern era  known to have occurred in what is now the United States  25  As many as 5 405 warriors and their families marching on K lauea were killed by that eruption  26  Volcanic activity and subsequent erosion have created impressive geological features  The Big Island has the third highest point among the world s islands  27  Slope instability of the volcanoes has generated damaging earthquakes with related tsunamis  particularly in 1868 and 1975  28  Steep cliffs have been caused by catastrophic debris avalanches on the submerged flanks of ocean island volcanos  29  30  Flora and fauna Because the islands are so far from other land habitats  life before human activity is said to have arrived by the  3 W s   wind  carried through the air   waves  brought by ocean currents   and wings  birds  insects  and whatever they brought with them   This isolation  and the wide range of environments  extreme altitude  tropical climate  produced a vast array of endemic flora and fauna  see Endemism in the Hawaiian Islands   Hawaii has more endangered species and has lost a higher percentage of its endemic species than any other U S  state  31  Protected areas Endemic Silversword near Haleakal  summit Several areas in Hawaii are under the protection of the National Park Service  32  Hawaii has two national parks  Haleakala National Park near Kula  on Maui  includes Haleakal   the dormant volcano that formed east Maui  and Hawaii Volcanoes National Park in the southeast region of the island of Hawai i  which includes the active volcano K lauea and its various rift zones  There are three national historical parks  Kalaupapa National Historical Park in Kalaupapa  Moloka i  the site of a former Hansen s disease colony  Kaloko Honok hau National Historical Park in Kailua Kona on the island of Hawai i  and Pu uhonua o H naunau National Historical Park  an ancient place of refuge  Other areas under the control of the National Park Service include Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail on the Big Island and the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor on O ahu  The Papah naumoku kea Marine National Monument was proclaimed by President George W  Bush on June 15  2006  The monument covers roughly 140 000 square miles  360 000 km2  of reefs  atolls and shallow and deep sea out to 50 miles  80 km  offshore in the Pacific Ocean  larger than all of America s National Parks combined  33  Climate See also  List of Hawaii tornadoes and Environment of Hawaii Sunset in Kona  The colors of the sunset are partly due to vog  a form of air pollution that results when sulfur dioxide and other gases and particles emitted by an erupting volcano react with oxygen and moisture in the presence of sunlight  Hawaii s climate is typical for the tropics  although temperatures and humidity tend to be a bit less extreme due to near constant trade winds from the east  Summer highs are usually in the upper 80s  F   around 31  C  during the day and mid 70s   around 24  C  at night  Winter day temperatures are usually in the low to mid 80s   around 28  C  and  at low elevation  seldom dipping below the mid 60s  18  C  at night  Snow  not usually associated with the tropics  falls at 4 205 metres  13 796 ft  on Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa on the Big Island in some winter months  Snow rarely falls on Haleakala  Mount Wai ale ale  on Kaua i  has the second highest average annual rainfall on Earth  about 460 inches  11 7 m   Most of Hawaii has only two seasons  the dry season from May to October  and the wet season from October to April  34  The warmest temperature recorded in the state is 100 F  making it tied with Alaska as the lowest high temperature recorded in a U S  state  in Pahala on April 27  1931  Hawaii s all time record low temperature is 12 F observed in May 1979 on the summit of Mauna Kea  Hawaii is the only state to have never recorded sub zero Fahrenheit temperatures  Local climates vary considerably on each island  grossly divisible into windward  Ko olau  and leeward  Kona  areas based upon location relative to the higher mountains  Windward sides face cloud cover  so resorts concentrate on sunny leeward coasts  Monthly normal low and high temperatures for various Hawaiian cities 35  City Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May

History Main article  History of Hawaii History of Hawaii Ancient times Monarchy Provisional Government Republic Territory   State   Hawaii is one of four states that were independent prior to becoming part of the United States  along with the Vermont Republic  1791   the Republic of Texas  1845   and the California Republic  1846   and one of two  along with Texas  that had formal diplomatic recognition internationally  36  The Kingdom of Hawaii was sovereign from 1810 until 1893 when the monarchy was overthrown by resident American  and some European  businessmen  It was an independent republic from 1894 until 1898  when it was annexed by the United States as a territory  becoming a state in 1959  37  Hawaii was the target of a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor by Imperial Japan on December 7  1941  The attack on Pearl Harbor and other military and naval installations on O ahu  carried out by aircraft and by midget submarines  brought the United States into World War II  Pre European contact ancient Hawai i  800 1778  Main article  Ancient Hawaii The earliest habitation supported by archaeological evidence dates to as early as 300 CE  probably by Polynesian settlers from the Marquesas  followed by a second wave of migration from Raiatea and Bora Bora in the 11th century  The first recorded European contact with the islands was in 1778 by British explorer James Cook  Polynesians from the Marquesas and possibly the Society Islands may have first populated the Hawaiian Islands between 300 and 500 CE  There is a great deal of debate regarding these dates  38  Some archaeologists and historians believe that an early settlement from the Marquesas and a later wave of immigrants from Tahiti  c  1000  introduced a new line of high chiefs  the Kapu system  the practice of human sacrifice and the building of heiaus  This later immigration is detailed in folk tales about Pa ao  Other authors argue that there is no archaeological or linguistic evidence for a later influx of Tahitian settlers  and that Pa ao must be regarded as a myth  Kalani  pu u  King of Hawaii bringing presents to Captain Cook  Illustrated by John Webber  artist aboard Cook s ship  Regardless of the question of Pa ao  historians agree that the history of the islands was marked by a slow but steady growth in population and the size of the chiefdoms  which grew to encompass whole islands  Local chiefs  called ali i  ruled their settlements and launched wars to extend their sway and defend their communities from predatory rivals  James Cook European arrival and the Kingdom of Hawaii  1778 1893  The 1778 arrival of British explorer James Cook was Hawaii s first documented contact with European explorers  Cook named the islands the  Sandwich Islands  in honor of his sponsor John Montagu  4th Earl of Sandwich  He published the islands  location and reported the native name as Owyhee  This spelling lives on in Owyhee County  Idaho  after three Hawaiian members of a trapping party killed in that area  Cook visited the islands twice  Upon his departure during his second visit in 1779  a quarrel ensued  involving Cook s taking of temple idols and fencing as  firewood   39  and the taking of a ship s boat by a minor chief and his men  Cook then abducted the King of the Big Island of Hawaii  Kalani  pu u  and held him as ransom aboard his ship for the return of the boat  a tactic that had worked for Cook in Tahiti and other islands  40  Kalani  pu u s supporters fought back and Cook and four Marines were killed as Cook s party retreated to the beach and launched their boats  After Cook s visit and the publication of several books relating his voyages  the Hawaiian islands received many European visitors  explorers  traders  and eventually whalers who found the islands a convenient harbor and source of supplies  Early British influence can be seen in the design of the flag of Hawaii which has the British Union Flag in the corner  These visitors introduced diseases to the once isolated islands and the Hawaiian population plunged precipitously 41  because native Hawaiians had no resistance to influenza  smallpox  and measles  among others  During the 1850s  measles killed a fifth of Hawaii s people  42  Historical records indicated that the earliest immigration of the Chinese came from Guangdong province  a few sailors in 1778 with Captain Cook s journey  more in 1788 with Kaina  and some in 1789 with an American trader who settled in Hawaii in the late 18th century  House of Kamehameha King Kamehameha receiving Otto von Kotzebue s Russian naval expedition  Drawing by Louis Choris in 1816  During the 1780s and 1790s  chiefs were often fighting for power  After a series of battles that ended in 1795 and forced cession of the island of Kaua i in 1810  all inhabited islands were subjugated under a single ruler who became known as King Kamehameha the Great  He established the House of Kamehameha  a dynasty that ruled the kingdom until 1872  After Kamehameha II inherited the throne in 1819  American Protestant missionaries to Hawaii converted many Hawaiians to Christianity  Their influence ended many ancient practices  and Kamehameha III was the first Christian king  One prominent Protestant missionary  Hiram Bingham I  was a trusted adviser to the monarchy during this period  Other missionaries and their descendants became active in commercial and political affairs  leading to future conflicts between the monarchy and its restive American subjects  Missionaries from other Christian denominations  such as Catholics  Mormons  and Episcopalians  were active  but never converted more than a minority of the Native Hawaiian population  The death of the bachelor King Kamehameha V who did not name an heir resulted in the popular election of Lunalilo over Kal kaua  Lunalilo died the next year  also without naming an heir  Perhaps  the People s King   Lunalilo  wanted the people to choose his successor as they had chosen him  In 1874 the election was contested within the legislature between Kal kaua and Emma  This led to riots and the landing of U S  and British troops  and governance passed to the House of Kal kaua  1887 Constitution and overthrow preparations In 1887  Kal kaua was forced to sign the 1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii  which stripped the king of much of his authority  There was a property qualification for voting  which disenfranchised most Hawaiians and immigrant laborers  and favored the wealthier white community  Resident whites were allowed to vote  but resident Asians were excluded  Because the 1887 Constitution was signed under threat of violence  it is known as the  Bayonet Constitution   King Kal kaua  reduced to a figurehead  reigned until his death in 1891  His sister  Lili uokalani  succeeded him on the throne  Ship s landing force at the time of the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy  January 1893  In 1893  Queen Lili uokalani announced plans for a new constitution  On January 14  1893  a group of mostly Euro American business leaders and residents formed a Committee of Safety to overthrow the Kingdom and seek annexation by the United States  United States Government Minister John L  Stevens  responding to a request from the Committee of Safety  summoned a company of U S  Marines  As one historian noted  the presence of these troops effectively made it impossible for the monarchy to protect itself  43  Overthrow of 1893 the Republic of Hawaii  1894 1898  In January 1893  Queen Lili uokalani was overthrown and replaced by a Provisional Government composed of members of the Committee of Safety  Controversy filled the following years as the queen tried to re establish her throne  The administration of President Grover Cleveland commissioned the Blount Report  which concluded that the removal of Lili uokalani was illegal  The U S  government first demanded that Queen Lili uokalani be reinstated  but the Provisional Government refused  Congress followed with another investigation  and submitted the Morgan Report on February 26  1894  which found all parties  including Minister Stevens  with the exception of the queen  not guilty  from any responsibility for the overthrow  44  The accuracy and impartiality of both the Blount and Morgan reports has been questioned by partisans on both sides of the debate over the events of 1893  43  45  46  47  In 1993  a joint Apology Resolution regarding the overthrow was passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton  apologizing for the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom  47  It is the first time in American history that the United States government has apologized for overthrowing the government of a sovereign nation   Iolani Palace in Honolulu  formerly the residence of the Hawaiian monarch  was the capitol of the Republic of Hawaii  The Provisional Government of Hawaii ended on July 4  1894  replaced by the Republic of Hawaii  The first Japanese immigrants arrived in Hawaii in 1885 as contract laborers for the sugar cane and pineapple plantations  Puerto Rican immigration to Hawaii began when Puerto Rico s sugar industry was devastated by two hurricanes in 1899  The devastation caused a world wide shortage of sugar and a huge demand for the product from Hawaii  Hawaiian sugar plantation owners began to recruit the jobless

1965  Annexation the Territory of Hawaii  1898 1959  After William McKinley won the presidential election in 1896  Hawaii s annexation to the U S  was again discussed  The previous president  Grover Cleveland  was a friend of Queen Lili uokalani  McKinley was open to persuasion by U S  expansionists and by annexationists from Hawaii  He met with three annexationists from Hawaii  Lorrin Thurston  Francis March Hatch and William Ansel Kinney  After negotiations  in June 1897  Secretary of State John Sherman agreed to a treaty of annexation with these representatives of the Republic of Hawaii  48  The treaty was never ratified by the U S  Senate  Instead  despite the opposition of a majority of Native Hawaiians  49  the Newlands Resolution was used to annex the Republic to the United States and it became the Territory of Hawaii  The Newlands Resolution was passed by the House June 15  1898  by a vote of 209 to 91  and by the Senate on July 6  1898  by a vote of 42 to 21  USS Shaw exploding during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor  December 7  1941 In 1900  Hawaii was granted self governance and retained  Iolani Palace as the territorial capitol building  Despite several attempts to become a state  Hawaii remained a territory for sixty years  Plantation owners and key capitalists  who maintained control through financial institutions  or  factors   known as the  Big Five   found territorial status convenient  enabling them to continue importing cheap foreign labor  such immigration was prohibited in various states  Political changes of 1954 the State of Hawaii  1959 present  Main article  Democratic Revolution of 1954  Hawaii  In the 1950s the power of the plantation owners was finally broken by descendants of immigrant laborers  Because they were born in a U S  territory  they were legal U S  citizens  The Hawaii Republican Party  strongly supported by plantation owners  was voted out of office  The Democratic Party of Hawaii dominated politics for 40 years  Expecting to gain full voting rights  Hawaii s residents actively campaigned for statehood  In March 1959  Congress passed the Hawaii Admission Act and U S  President Dwight D  Eisenhower signed it into law  50   The act excluded Palmyra Atoll  part of the Kingdom and Territory of Hawaii  from the new state   On June 27 of that year  a referendum asked residents of Hawaii to vote on the statehood bill  Hawaii voted 17 to 1 to accept  The choices were to accept the Act or to remain a territory  without the option of independence  51  52  53  The United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization later removed Hawaii from the United Nations list of Non Self Governing Territories  After statehood  Hawaii quickly modernized via construction and a rapidly growing tourism economy  Later  state programs promoted Hawaiian culture  The Hawaii State Constitutional Convention of 1978 incorporated programs such as the Office of Hawaiian Affairs to promote indigenous language and

 or 1 0   from the prior year and an increase of 63 657  or 5 3   since 2000  This includes a natural increase of 48 111 people  that is 96 028 births minus 47 917 deaths  and an increase due to net migration of 16 956 people into the state  Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 30 068 people  and migration within the country produced a net loss of 13 112 people  The center of population of Hawaii is located between the two islands of O ahu and Moloka i  55  Hawaii has a de facto population of over 1 3 million  due to large military and tourist populations  O ahu  nicknamed  The Gathering Place   is the most populous island  and has the highest population density   with a resident population of just under one million in 597 square miles  1 546 km2   about 1 650 people per square mile  for comparison  New Jersey  which has 8 717 925 people in 7 417 square miles  19 210 km2  is the most densely populated state with 1 134 people per square mile   56  Hawaii s 1 275 194 people  spread over 6 423 square miles  16 640 km2   including many unpopulated islands   results in an average population density of 188 6 persons per square mile  57  which makes

The Hawaiian language has about 2000 native speakers  less than 0 1  of the total population  64  According to the United States Census  there were 27 160 total speakers of the language in Hawaii in 2005  65  Hawaiian is a Polynesian member of the Austronesian language family  66  It is closely related to other Polynesian languages  such as Marquesan  Tahitian  M ori  Rapa Nui  the language of Easter Island   and less closely to Samoan  and Tongan  According to Sch tz  1994   the Marquesans colonized the archipelago in roughly 300 AD 67  followed by later waves of immigration from the Society Islands and Samoa Tonga  Those Polynesians remained in the islands  thereby becoming the Hawaiian people  Their languages  over time  became the Hawaiian language  68  Kimura and Wilson  1983  also state   Linguists agree that Hawaiian is closely related to Eastern Polynesian  with a particularly strong link in the Southern Marquesas  and a secondary link in Tahiti  which may be explained by voyaging between the Hawaiian and Society Islands   69  Before the arrival of Captain James Cook  the Hawaiian language had no written form  That form was developed mainly by American Protestant missionaries during 1820 1826  They assigned letters from the Latin alphabet that corresponded to the Hawaiian sounds  Interest in Hawaiian increased significantly in the late 20th century  With the help of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs  specially designated immersion schools were established where all subjects would be taught in Hawaiian  Also  the University of Hawaii developed a Hawaiian language graduate studies program  Municipal codes were altered to favor Hawaiian place and street names for new civic developments  Hawaiian distinguishes between long and short vowels  In modern practice  vowel length is indicated with a macron  kahak    Also  Hawaiian uses the glottal stop as a consonant   okina   It is written as a symbol similar to the apostrophe or opening single quote  Hawaiian language newspapers published from 1834 1948 and traditional native speakers of Hawaiian generally omit the marks in their own writing  The  okina and kahak  are intended to help non native speakers  Hawaiian Pidgin Main article  Hawaiian Pidgin Some locals speak Hawaii Creole English  HCE   often called  pidgin   The lexicon of HCE derives mainly from English but also has words from Hawaiian  Chinese  Japanese  Portuguese  Ilocano and Tagalog  During the 19th century  the increase in immigration  mainly from China  Japan  Portugal and especially from the Azores archipelago and Spain   caused a variant of English to develop  By the early 20th century pidgin speakers had children who acquired the pidgin as their first language  HCE speakers use some Hawaiian words without those words being considered archaic  Most place names are retained from Hawaiian  as are some names for plants or animals  For example  tuna fish are often called ahi  International Market Place  Honolulu  1958  HCE speakers have modified the meanings of certain English words  For example   aunty  and  uncle  refer to any adult who is a friend  or to show respect for an elder  Simplified grammar is used  For example  instead of  It is hot today  isn t it    an HCE speaker would say simply  stay hot  eh   When a word does not come to mind quickly  the term  da kine  refers to any word you cannot think of  Through the surfing boom in Hawaii  HCE has influenced surfer slang  Some HCE expressions  such as brah and da kine  have found their way to other places  Spelling of state name A somewhat divisive political issue arose when the constitution of the State of Hawaii added Hawaiian as a second official state language  the exact spelling of the state s name  which in the islands  language is Hawai i  the apostrophe marking a Hawaiian consonant  a cut off of breath before the final i   In the Hawaii Admission Act that granted Hawaiian statehood  the federal government recognized Hawaii to be the official state name  Official government publications  as well as department and office titles  use the traditional Hawaiian spelling  with no symbols for glottal stops or vowel length  70  In contrast  some private entities  including a local newspaper  do use such symbols  The title of the state constitution is  The Constitution of the State of Hawaii   In Article XV  Section 1 uses  The State of Hawaii   Section 2  the island of Oahu   Section 3  The Hawaiian flag   and Section 5 specifies the state motto as  Ua mau ke ea o ka aina i ka pono   Since these documents predate the modern use of the  okina and the kahak  in Hawaiian orthography  the diacritics were not used  Religion A church in Hawaii  1958 The largest denominations by number of adherents were the Catholic Church with 240 813 in 2000 71  and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints with 68 128 in 2009  72  According to data provided by religious establishments  religion in

in 2003 was US 47 billion  per capita income for Hawaii residents was US 30 441  Hawaiian exports include food and apparel  These industries play a small role in the Hawaiian economy  however  due to the considerable shipping distance to viable markets  such as the West Coast of the United States  Food exports include coffee  see coffee production in Hawaii   macadamia nuts  pineapple  livestock  and sugarcane  Agricultural sales for 2002  according to the Hawaii Agricultural Statistics Service  were US 370 9 million from diversified agriculture  US 100 6 million from pineapple  and US 64 3 million from sugarcane  Hawaii has a relatively high state tax burden  In 2003  Hawaii residents had the highest state tax per capita at US 2 838  This is partly because education  health care and social services are all provided directly by the state  as opposed to local government in all other states  Millions of tourists contribute to the tax take by paying the general excise tax and hotel room tax  thus not all taxes come directly from residents  Business leaders  however  consider the state s tax burden too high  contributing to both higher prices and the perception of an unfriendly business climate  79  See the list of businesses in Hawaii for more on commerce  Hawaii was one of the few states to control gasoline prices through a Gas Cap Law  Since oil company profits in Hawaii compared to the mainland U S  were under scrutiny  the law tied local gasoline prices to those of the mainland  It took effect in September 2005 amid price fluctuations caused by Hurricane Katrina

major cities in the United States  However  the cost of living in Honolulu is 6 7  lower than in New York  NY and 3 6  lower than in San Francisco  CA  82  These numbers may not take into account certain costs  such as increased travel costs for longer flights  additional shipping fees  and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers  outside the continental United States   While some online stores do offer free shipping on orders to Hawaii  83  many merchants exclude Hawaii  Alaska  Puerto Rico and certain other US territories  The median home value in Hawaii in the 2000 US Census was  272 700 while the national median home value was less than half  at  119 600  Hawaii home values were the highest of all states  including California with a median home value of  211 500  84  More recent research from the National Association of Realtors places the 2010 median sale price of a single family home in Honolulu  Hawaii at  607 600 and the US median sales price at  173 200  The sale price of single family homes in Hawaii was the highest of any US city in 2010  just above the  Silicon Valley  area of California   602 000   85  One of the most significant contributors to the high cost of living in Hawaii is the Merchant Marine Act of 1920  also known as the Jones Act   which prevents foreign flagged ships from carrying cargo between two American ports  a practice known as cabotage   Most U S  consumer goods are manufactured in East Asia at present  but because of the Jones Act  foreign ships inbound with those goods cannot stop in Honolulu  offload Hawaii bound goods  load mainland bound Hawaii manufactured goods  and continue to West Coast ports  Instead  they must proceed directly to the West Coast  where distributors break bulk and send Hawaiian bound Asian manufactured goods back west across the ocean by U S  flagged ships  Hawaiian consumers ultimately bear the expense of transporting goods again across the Pacific on U S  flagged ships subject to the extremely high operating costs imposed by the Seamen s Act  This also makes Hawaii less competitive with West Coast ports as a shopping destination for tourists from home countries with much higher taxes  like Japan   even though prices for Asian manufactured goods in theory should be cheaper since Hawaii is much closer to Asia  citation needed  Culture Main article

to employees who work more than twenty hours per week  Heavy regulation of insurance companies helps keep the cost to employers down  Due in part to heavy emphasis on preventive care  Hawaiians require hospital treatment less frequently than the rest of the United States  while total health care expenses  measured as a percentage of state GDP  are substantially lower  Given these achievements  proponents of universal health care elsewhere in the U S  sometimes use Hawaii as a model for proposed federal and state health care plans  Education Public schools Main article  Hawai i Department of Education Hawaii has the U S   only school system that is unified statewide  Policy decisions are made by the fourteen member state Board of Education  The Board sets policy and hires the superintendent of schools  who oversees the state Department of Education  The Department of Education is divided into seven districts  four on O ahu and one for each of the three other counties  The main rationale for centralization is to combat inequalities between highly populated O ahu and the more rural Neighbor Islands  and between lower income and more affluent areas  In most of the United States  schools are funded from local property taxes  Educators struggle with children of non native English speaking immigrants  whose cultures are different from those of the mainland  where most course materials and testing standards originate   Public elementary  middle  and high school test scores in Hawaii are below national averages on tests mandated under the No Child Left Behind Act  Some of the gap has been attributed to the Hawaii Board of Education s requirement that all eligible students take these tests and report all student test scores  other states  Texas and Michigan

12 presidential elections  The exceptions were 1972 and 1984  In 2004  John Kerry won the state s four electoral votes by a margin of nine percentage points with 54  of the vote  Every county supported the Democratic candidate  In 1964  favorite son candidate Senator Hiram Fong of Hawaii sought the Republican presidential nomination  while Patsy Mink ran in the Oregon primary in 1972  Honolulu native  the 44th United States President Barack Obama  then serving as United States Senator from Illinois  was elected President of the United States on November 4  2008  Obama had won the Hawaiian Democratic Caucus on February 19  2008 with 76  of the vote  He was the third Hawaii born candidate to seek the nomination of a major party and the first presidential nominee from Hawaii  93  94  Transportation See also  Hawaii Department of Transportation and Aviation in Hawaii A system of state highways encircles each main island  Only O ahu has federal highways  and is the only area outside the contiguous 48 states to have signed Interstate highways  Travel can be slow due to narrow winding roads  and congestion in cities  Each major island has a public bus system  Honolulu International Airport is the major commercial aviation hub of Hawaii  with intercontinental services to North America  Asia  Australia  and Oceania  Within Hawaii  Hawaiian Airlines  Mokulele Airlines and go  use jets between the larger airports in Honolulu  L hu e  Kahului  Kona and Hilo  while Island Air and Pacific Wings serve smaller airports  These airlines also provide air freight service between the islands  Private steamships and ferries were the sole way of traveling between the islands from the 19th century until the 1950s  citation needed Seaflite operated hydrofoils between the major islands in the mid 1970s  95  The Hawaii Superferry operated between O ahu and Maui between December 2007 and March 2009  with additional routes planned for other islands  Legal issues over environmental impact statements and protests ended the service  though the company operating Superferry has expressed a wish to begin ferry service again at a future date  96  Currently there is passenger ferry service in Maui County between Moloka i and Maui  and between Lana i and Maui  though neither of these takes vehicles  Norwegian Cruise Lines also provides passenger cruise ship service between the islands  citation needed  At one time  Hawaii had a network of railroads on each of the larger islands that helped move farm commodities as well as passengers  These railroads were all narrow gauge  3 ft  914 mm  gauge for the majority although there were some 2 ft 6 in  762 mm  gauge on some of the smaller islands   standard US gauge is 4 ft 8 1 2 in  1 435 mm    The largest by far was the Oahu Railway and Land Company  OR amp L  which ran multiple lines from Honolulu across the western and northern part of Oahu  The OR amp L was an important player moving troops and goods during World War II  Traffic on this line was busy enough that there were signals on the lines facilitating movement of trains and wigwag signals at some railroad crossings for the protection of motorists  The mainline was officially abandoned in 1947  although part of it was bought by the US Navy and operated until 1970  Thirteen miles  21 km  of track remain and preservationists occasionally run trains over a portion of this line  97  Ni ihau  70 sq  mi   Kaua i  552 3 sq  mi   O ahu  598 sq  mi   Maui  727 3 sq  mi   Moloka i  260 sq  mi   L na i  140 5 sq  mi   Kaho olawe
