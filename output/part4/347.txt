may be too long or excessively detailed  Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise   November 2010   edit  Scorpion Gargan as the Scorpion  Art by Sal Buscema  Mac Gargan was a private investigator initially hired by J  Jonah Jameson to find out how Peter Parker is able to obtain incredible pictures of Spider Man  4  Gargan s efforts set off Peter s spider sense and the teen was able to easily evade the detective  Jameson then decided to hire Gargan as the subject of a barely tested process that would endow him with the useful characteristics of a particular animal with the help of Dr  Farley Stillwell  In this case  a scorpion was the base for the purposes of creating a powerful agent capable of defeating Spider Man  The Scorpion proved to be more than a match for the wall crawler  defeating him twice  but the mutagenic treatment seriously affected Gargan s mind  driving him insane  He promptly turned on his benefactor but Spider Man intervened  and managed to finally defeat the Scorpion in their third battle  Jameson was struck with the irony that he was saved by the man he tried to destroy from the thing he created to destroy him  5  Since then  the Scorpion became a professional criminal and would return to indulge in his deadly vendetta against Spider Man and Jameson  only to be defeated again  6  He was later hired by a spy ring to follow S H I E L D  agent Sharon Carter  but was defeated by Captain America  7  Scorpion was acquired by Mr  Kline  who created android duplicates of the Scorpion and Mr  Hyde to dispatch against Daredevil  8  The real Scorpion and Mr  Hyde then launched a campaign of terror against S H I E L D  agents  but were defeated by Captain America and the Falcon  9  After being released from prison for good behavior  the Scorpion resumes his criminal career and encounters and defeats Spider Man again  After realizing that the wall crawler survived the encounter  he receives help from the Jackal who gives him Spider Man s location  The Scorpion arrives at a hospital room finding Peter Parker and his Aunt May  Not realizing that he had Spider Man right there  he threatens May and demands to know where Spider Man is and  after she faints  Scorpion rampages through the hospital  A furious Spider Man beats the Scorpion and forces him to apologize to May  10  The Scorpion  through the course of his career  acquired a few items  a new costume  and several new tails  one that spurted acid  another that spurted tear gas  and one that can deliver electric blasts from the stinger  He also fought Ms  Marvel after a botched revenge attempt against Jameson  the Scorpion became more psychotic than usual after his battle with Ms  Marvel  resulting in his being dumped in acid  11  In the sewers  his sanity deteriorating  Scorpion came to believe that his costume couldn t come off  However  after a quick encounter  Spider Man proved to him that his belief of being a monster was in his mind  12  He formed an extortion racket to sabotage the Daily Bugle  but was thwarted by Spider Man and Captain America  13  He was freed from prison by agents of Egghead  who wanted him as a member of the third Masters of Evil alongside Whirlwind and Moonstone  The team fought the Avengers but were defeated  14  Scorpion would make another attempt to ruin Jameson s life by kidnapping his bride Marla Madison on their wedding day but she is rescued by Spider Man  15  Jonah does appreciate the irony from his relationship with the Scorpion and eventually decided to publicly confess to his role in creating the supervillain when the original Hobgoblin tried to use that secret to blackmail him  16  Despite his encounters with other foes  Scorpion has always had a special hatred for Spider Man and Jameson  which extended when he attempted becoming a mercenary for Justin Hammer  who had the Scorpion s battlesuit modified  Namely  he ruined his prospects on his first mission  to capture a war hero  when he could not resist creating a hostage situation simply to bring Jameson to him for revenge  In reaction  Hammer sent Blacklash and Rhino to subdue Gargan and confiscate the tail enhancement equipment for abrogating his contract  17  During the Acts of Vengeance  he tried to enter Canada to avoid the Super Power Registration Act  The Tinkerer met him at the airport and provided him with a modified scorpion tail for his costume  He  Asp  Nekra  and Owl  who were under the control of Llan the Sorcerer  were repelled by Alpha Flight and Gamma Flight  18  He was then hired by the Chameleon to kill a de powered Spider Man  He was defeated by the Black Cat  19  At one point  the Scorpion s constant defeats at the hands of Spider Man drove him to depression  He wandered the sewers  his mind becoming clearer than it had been since his transformation and decided to quit being the Scorpion  He encountered a depressed and crisis ridden Spider Man  Ignoring Gargan s plea that he had changed  the wall crawler beat him savagely  20  In his next appearance  Gargan was back to being psychopathic  He battled and was defeated by Spider Man s clone Ben Reilly  21  Scorpion temporarily worked for Roxxon and helped them in their phony  Rehabilitation Therapy   Roxxon updated the Scorpion s powers and costume and promised he would get back at his enemies  Spider Man managed to convince Scorpion that he was only being used as Jameson had once before  Scorpion then turned on Roxxon and was then defeated by the web slinger  22  Gargan reappeared during the aftermath of the Secret War that had been organized by Nick Fury against Latveria  He was among the supervillains who had been supplied with enhanced technology by Latverian dictator Lucia von Bardas and sent to attack the heroes who had been involved in Fury s Secret War  The villains  technologies were then hijacked by von Bardas  supplying her with power  potentially at the cost of the villains  lives  but the assembled heroes defeated von Bardas and apprehended Scorpion and the others  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Venom Panel from Marvel Knights  Spider Man  10  first appearance of Gargan as Venom  Art by Terry Dodson  Main article  Venom  comics  Later on through circumstances yet to be revealed  Norman Osborn reveals Spider Man s true identity to Gargan and gives him orders to kidnap Peter s Aunt May should Osborn ever be captured and imprisoned  When Spider Man defeats Osborn  he is imprisoned and Gargan carries out Osborn s orders in kidnapping Aunt May  Gargan eventually summons Peter and tells him the only way he can see his aunt again is to break Norman out of jail  Shortly thereafter  the Venom symbiote approaches Gargan  23  offering him new abilities  and Gargan becomes bonded with the creature  This would later give him an extra edge as part of Norman Osborn s Sinister Twelve  24  Even with these additional powers he is still swiftly defeated by Spider Man  as the Avengers deal with the rest of the Twelve  25  So far he remains bonded with the symbiote  Though incarcerated  26  Gargan is unfazed  as with his new powers came the respect of becoming an  A list  villain  Alongside Spider Man and other villains and heroes  Venom is kidnapped by other dimensional forces  He succeeds in killing Spider Man  who is really the original Space Phantom in disguise  27  For his crimes  the Inhumans matriarch Medusa orders his execution and almost carries it out herself  Later  he tries to kill the other participants for the  Beyonder s  wish fulfillment prize for the winner 28  but fails and is returned to Earth alongside the rest of the group  29   edit  Thunderbolts Gargan later becomes a member of a sub group of the Thunderbolts  30  which has been drafted by the Avengers to hunt down the members of the fugitive Secret Avengers and is currently run by the Commission for Superhuman Activities  31  It is then revealed that he has been outfitted with electrical implants by the government to keep the symbiote in check  32  As a Thunderbolt  he is seen as a hero by the general public and has his own action figures  33  Gargan displays his new raw power as Venom in a battle with Jack Flag  after pummeling Flag for a bit  the hero manages to stab Gargan  who is protected by his symbiote  Gargan becomes enraged and ferociously man handles Flag  and is about to eat him when his electrical implants kick in and temporarily subdue him  allowing Flag to live  34  Gargan expresses fear of the control the symbiote possesses over him  yet he has become addicted to the raw unearthly power it brings to him  and cannot begin to imagine life without it  similarly to a drug addict  35  An attack from Steel Spider and Sepulchre makes him lose control again  briefly becoming a huge monster once more  while Moonstone is incapacitated and thus cannot coordinate control of his electrical implants  36  Afterwards  however  he returns to a normal form with no ill effects  He also bites off and devours Steel Spider s arm during a fight  37  Gargan is later ordered by Norman Osborn to hunt down Namor  After shooting him with a Thunderbolts supplied weapon  Gargan disables Namor by ripping off his feet wings  However  the Sub Mariner manages to render Gargan unconscious and then rips out the symbiote s tongue  38  although the symbiote easily makes a new one  Gargan begins to hallucinate that the symbiote is speaking to him  telling him to  feed  it    He later attacks and devours a guard and declares that  the only way out of Thunderbolts Mountain is when I decide to let you die   39  It is later revealed that the psychic criminal Bluestreak is controlling Gargan s actions  although it is uncertain whether the symbiote was actually speaking to him  40  Venom goes up against the Swordsman  who stabs Gargan through the chest  using his powers to force the symbiote away from his sword  Gargan is wounded  but lives  41  After healing  he retains his monstrous form  rarely returning to his usual size   edit  New Ways to Die Gargan reappears during the  New Ways to Die  arc of The Amazing Spider Man  no longer possessing the knowledge of Spider Man s secret identity  42  Gargan and the Thunderbolts are called back to New York to capture Spider Man  While on a search for the wall crawler  Gargan s symbiote senses a former host at the F E A S T center  Gargan suspects that it s Spider Man and searches the place only to find Eddie Brock  The Venom symbiote attempts to leave Gargan to re bond with Brock  much to Gargan s  and Brock s  dismay  However  upon making contact with Brock  Brock s skin is shown to be caustic to his former symbiote  and as a white substance seeps out of his pores covering his body  Brock becomes Anti Venom and battles Gargan  With some help from Spider Man  Brock subdues Gargan and nearly destroys the symbiote  43  Norman Osborn uses a sample of the Anti Venom s symbiote from Mac Gargan and creates a poisonous counter to its healing powers by combining the sample with the immune system of Freak  Mac Gargan is injected with the  cure  and is given a new Scorpion battlesuit  which contains the poison  until the symbiote can recover  44  Anti Venom tracks down Gargan at Oscorp  After a grueling battle  Ven orpion  injects the poison into Anti Venom and seemly kills the suit  He then attempts to kill Brock but the symbiote tries holding him back  still feeling love for its former host  The symbiote gains its strength and breaks though the Scorpion suit  Gargan gives up but promises that he will get past this problem and will someday finish Brock  45   edit  Secret Invasion Gargan was seen being thrown from Thunderbolt Mountain by Captain Marvel  46  Gargan was later seen with the other Thunderbolts in Washington  The Skrulls attempt to trick him into killing normal humans to find out which of them are Skrulls  47  Osborn attempted to prevent the symbiote from killing anyone by threatening to kill Mac Gargan and promising to help satisfy his  urges  later  only for Gargan to reveal that the threat he appeared to pose to civilians was a ruse in order to draw out a disguised Skrull  Venom played a huge part in fighting the Skrulls  He was seen slashing and eating the Skrulls all at once  48  He soon joins the Thunderbolts and the remaining heroes for the final battle against the Skrulls  During the battle  he was a force to be reckoned with  49  Venom  along with most of the Thunderbolts team  attempts to kill partner Songbird on the orders of Osborn  Facing Venom  Songbird was defeated and almost eaten by Venom  but escaped with help from the Swordsman  50   edit  Dark Reign Mac Gargan as Spider Man  Art By Mike Deodato Jr  Norman Osborn forms his Dark Avengers  providing new identities to some of his former Thunderbolts  After feeding a Skrull to a hungry Venom that has become more bestial than human  Osborn gives him a medication that resets the symbiote to the size it was when it possessed Spider Man originally  However  Gargan can transform into his Venom form at will  Norman introduces Gargan and the symbiote as the Amazing Spider Man in his new Avengers  51  During their first mission against Morgana le Fay  Morgana transforms  Venom Spidey  into a giant  demonic monster who then tries to eat Ares  52  Venom later coughs up Ares  however Morgana s magic affects Venom  causing him to lose and gain control of himself randomly  53  After Morgana is defeated in the past by Iron Patriot and Doctor Doom  Mac returned to his  Spider Man  form with only a slight headache  Hawkeye promised to kill Mac one day for trying to eat him while he was under Morgana s control  54  Once they arrive home  he is seen arguing with Hawkeye  55  Later  attempting to find out Norman Osborn s plans for his son Harry  the real Spider Man  with the aid of the Invisible Woman  manages to capture Gargan by using a sonic generator and takes his place to infiltrate the Dark Avengers  Gargan is thrown into the Negative Zone  56  but is later seen back with the Dark Avengers  Against Osborn s wishes  Gargan is seen heading out into the city to  fight crime  solo  At one point  he is seen defeating a bank robber called General Wolfram  After making out with two girls at once and getting cheered by a large crowd  he takes the robber to an abandoned roof top and consumes his arm  He then takes the money Wolfram stole and swings away  Gargan is then seen at a strip club with the money and discovers his new favorite stripper  After getting reprimanded by Norman Osborn for eating Wolfram s arm  Gargan kills the stripper and places her dead body in J  Jonah Jameson s bed while he is gone in an attempt to frame him for her murder  At the same time  Redeemer visits the injured General Wolfram and recruits him alongside other villains who have had limbs bitten off by Gargan  namely Dementoid  Doctor Everything  Eleven  and Hippo  in a plan to take down  Spider Man   who is believed to be the root of their problem   57  In another attempt to antagonize Jameson  Gargan instigates a turf war between two rival street gangs  hoping to wear Jameson down through stress and exhaustion from continuously putting out stories to cover the crime wave  At the same time  the Redeemer arms his group with cybernetic limbs to defeat Spider Man  J  Jonah Jameson goes to Osborn for help and is given Spider Man to help solve the city s gang problem  58  However  Gargan continues to instigate the gang war and aggravate Jameson in person  A bomb threat is placed by Redeemer to lure Spider Man into an intervention  though Gargan instead devours Hippo and Eleven  badly injures Dementoid  and beats Doctor Everything into submission before turning him over to the police  He then eats Redeemer s limbs  With Redeemer  Wolfram  and Dementoid the only ones still remaining of the group  albeit hospitalized   Redeemer sends photos of Gargan s actions to Jameson in an attempt to expose him as a cannibalistic psychopath to the world  59  Jameson first goes to Osborn  who decides to cut Gargan loose by sending Bullseye and Daken  in their old costumes  to kill him  At the Big Apple Festival  the two attack him  with Dementoid  General Wolfram  and both gangs involved in the turf war entering the fray to try to kill Spider Man  Gargan ends up defeating all of them  and J  Jonah Jameson shoots a gun in the air to stop the fight  As a result  everyone credits Jameson and Spider Man with successfully working together to stop criminals and save the festival  Gargan later returns to Avengers Tower  where he is visited by Norman Osborn  Osborn informs him that Bullseye and Daken will get over being hurt  but warns Gargan that if he goes out of control again  he will suit up as the Iron Patriot and take care of him personally  60  During the opening chapter of Utopia  the Dark Avengers are sent into San Francisco to quell the mutant riots and battle any X Men they can find  Tension is shown to exist between the Avengers and Osborn s own Dark X Men  When Namor and Emma Frost are revealed to be double agents on Cyclops  side and defect with Cloak and Dagger  an irate Osborn gathers the Dark Avengers and the remaining Dark X Men  Gargan included  ordering them to bring him Namor s head and Emma Frost s heart and to make sure that Cyclops sees them do it  61  The Dark Avengers and Dark X Men attack Utopia and battle the X Men  with Venom facing off against Colossus  However  due to the sheer number of X Men  Osborn is forced to retreat when informed that the only way to win would be to kill all the mutants on the island  an option which is not politically viable  62  Gargan later begins to show signs that his medications are making him emotionally unstable  On a mission with the Dark Avengers  Osborn takes Gargan off the case when he notices Gargan s outbursts  63 Molecule Man turns Gargan and his symbiote into an inert pile of goo  64  He is later restored by the Sentry  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Siege During the  Siege  storyline  Mac Gargan is with the Dark Avengers when Norman Osborn makes plans to invade Asgard  Mac Gargan and the rest of the Avengers protest  For fighting alongside the Initiative  Osborn promises to give the team their freedom from servitude  As a result  Gargan is among the mass of soldiers to launch an attack on Asgard following Loki s setup  He and the rest of the Avengers manage to overwhelm Thor  65  While fighting Ms  Marvel and Spider Man after they arrive  Gargan is forcefully removed from the Venom symbiote  which takes over Ms  Marvel until Spider Man defeats it  66  He along with the other Dark Avengers were arrested after Norman Osborn fell from power  67   edit  Return as Scorpion During the  Big Time  storyline  Mac Gargan is seen at the Raft where the Venom symbiote was removed from him  As for Gargan  the symbiote s removal was causing medical problems due to the side effects from his original genetic mutation  and Alistair Smythe broke him out of the Raft  68  Gargan was then fitted with a new Scorpion suit by Smythe which was also built with a life support system to stabilize Gargan s condition  and Smythe convinced Gargan to join him in his plan for revenge on J  Jonah Jameson  69  Scorpion joins Alistair Smythe  a new villain named Fly Girl  and some unnamed cyborg minions  each wanting revenge on J  Jonah Jameson  in attacking the launch site of John Jameson s latest space mission where they sabotage the launch and hold John Jameson for ransom  70   edit  Personality Before he donned the identity of the Scorpion  Mac was a skilled  if somewhat greedy and unscrupulous private investigator  who admitted that he d go through anything  just so long as the pay is good   5  As he is emotionally disturbed as a result of the procedure in which he acquired his powers  Mac retains little of his former rationality  He is typically easily outsmarted by Spider Man and is not very good at cooperating with other supervillains or following instructions as Justin Hammer learned  His most prominent weakness is his explosive temper and irrational hatred toward J  Jonah Jameson  to the point where he has been known to ignore the orders of whomever he is working for  in order to attack the Daily Bugle s publisher  volume  amp  issue needed  None of this has changed with his bonding to the Venom symbiote  or with his new career serving under Norman Osborn with the Thunderbolts or the Dark Avengers  In fact  the symbiote seems to have only made him even more irrational  and his new career as a  hero  has done nothing to curtail his lingering hatred of Jameson  volume  amp  issue needed  He nearly blew his cover as Spider Man when he started a drug war and photographs of him engaging in cannibalism wound up in J  Jonah Jameson s hands  putting his employer Norman Osborn s plans and the  heroic  status of his entire Dark Avengers team in jeopardy  just to pursue vengenance against Jameson  now the mayor of New York  yet again  His ill conceived and poorly thought out plan failed  and he was forced to publicly make peace with Jameson in his Spider Man guise  greatly embarrassing him  though he secretly fantasized about killing Jameson the whole while they were shaking hands  volume  amp  issue needed  The years of being outsmarted and beaten  despite his physical superiority over Spider Man  complement the similar hatred possessed by the symbiote  and has allowed it to almost completely control Gargan  Unlike the other Venoms  Mac very seldom refers to himself as  We  instead of  I   Gargan has even engaged in cannibalism as Venom  severing and devouring the arm of the still living Steel Spider  After getting  the taste of flesh   he is seen displaying even more signs of cannibalism such as eating Skrulls  consuming the bones of Swarm  devouring Eleven and the limbs of criminals  and trying to eat Ares  When the symbiote is dormant in his body he has expressed nausea and fear of the organism  71  Unlike Eddie Brock  any inhibitions Gargan had about harming innocent bystanders has been eliminated with his bonding to the symbiote  most likely because he had such little regard for others to begin with  Gargan s previous identity hasn t been completely degraded  His symbiote once sprouted a scorpion tail  although he hasn t had it since  Also when he learned there was a new hero calling herself the Scorpion  Gargan Venom attacked her to protect his trademark while it still lasted  Also  for a brief time  Gargan wore a new Scorpion suit while the symbiote regenerated after Anti Venom s attack  although initially he was hesitant about wearing it alongside the symbiote   edit  Powers and abilities  edit  As Scorpion Mac Gargan  as the Scorpion  was given superhuman powers through chemical and radiological treatments which produced mutagenic effects  He has superhuman strength  speed  agility  reflexes  stamina  and durability  and also has the ability to scale walls  he also punches holes in walls as a way to climb   He also has an exceptionally strong grip  reminiscent of a real scorpion s pincers  He wears a full body battlesuit composed of two layers of light steel mesh separated by a thin layer of insulated rubber  In addition to his superhuman physique  he was traditionally armed with a cybernetically controlled  seven foot mechanical tail  with a tool steel articulated framework which can whip at 90 miles per hour  The tail has in the past been equipped with projectile weapons  usually an electrical generator  although it has also been equipped with a spike at its tip which can squirt an acidic spray  and a low density plasma energy projector  The Scorpion can use his tail as an extra leg  or he can coil it behind him to spring himself a distance of at least 30 feet  The Scorpion is substantially stronger and more durable than Spider Man  though is a much less skilled hand to hand combatant   edit  As Venom With the Venom symbiote  Gargan retains his superhuman abilities  some of which have increased substantially beyond the original levels  The costume can even emulate the tail of Gargan s scorpion costume  It can also be used as a fifth limb  although he has only used this ability once   citation needed  As Venom  Gargan has gained the ability to shoot webbing and climb walls like Spider Man  and can disguise himself as other people or blend in with his background  He is undetectable by Spider Man s  spider sense   His skill as a hand to hand combatant has increased due to the influence of the alien symbiote  which has superior instincts and fighting experience  The costume can also heal grave injuries suffered by the host with incredible speed  Mac  as Venom  has claws on his fingers which can be used as weapons to slash his foes  He can also create tendrils to incapacitate his enemies  When injured or enraged  Venom now has the ability to increase its mass and physical strength in order to meet whatever threat it is facing with equal force  an ability inconsistently hinted in the past  such as when Venom battled the Juggernaut  During these times it is not clear that Gargan has any control over the symbiote  for had it not been for the technology restraining Venom  he would have eaten Jack Flag  Also  during a battle with the Steel Spider  Gargan attacks innocent bystanders  34  Though his power potential has greatly increased thanks to the symbiote  Gargan has still failed to evoke any respect from Spider Man  the web slinger s opinion being that  A loser dressed like Venom is still a freakin  loser   volume  amp  issue needed  and when announced as the Spider Man of the Dark Avengers  that  it s not even the good one    72   edit  As Spider Man A special  medication  provided by Osborn allowed Venom to assume a smaller  more human looking form similar to when Spider Man had control of the symbiote  From this form  he is able to switch back to his larger  more feral form whenever he pleases  As Spider Man  Mac seems to be even more agile than when he was as Venom  He also still has all of Venom s powers  minus the claws  tongue  and teeth  which he can regrow at will  59  However  his  medication  has also been shown to decrease his will to fight  making him more sympathetic  63   edit  Return as Scorpion After Smythe breaks him out of the Raft  Gargan is fitted with a new Scorpion suit  The suit is larger than its predecessor  and cybernetically wired into Gargan  making him a cyborg  It is equipped with a more powerful tail  mechanical pincers  and is bulletproof  Smythe also altered Gargan s biology  giving him a  scorpion sense  to match Spider Man s spider sense  69 The suit is also very tough  allowing Gargan to withstand a fall from a space shuttle  volume  amp  issue
