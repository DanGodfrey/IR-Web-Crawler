ik   Sango K d r s se t  B afr ka   is a landlocked country in Central Africa  It borders Chad in the north  Sudan in the northeast  South Sudan in the east  the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Congo in the south  and Cameroon in the west  The CAR covers a land area of about 240 000 square miles  620 000 km2   and has an estimated population of about 4 4 million as of 2008  Bangui is the capital city  Most of the CAR consists of Sudano Guinean savannas but it also includes a Sahelo Sudanian zone in the north and an equatorial forest zone in the south  Two thirds of the country lies in the basins of the Ubangi River  which flows south into the Congo River  while the remaining third lies in the basin of the Chari River  which flows north into Lake Chad  Since most of the territory is located in the Ubangi and Shari river basins  France called the colony it carved out in this region Ubangi Chari  or Oubangui Chari in French  It became a semi autonomous territory of the French Community in 1958 and then an independent nation on 13 August 1960  For over three decades after independence  the CAR was ruled by presidents who either were not freely elected or took power by force  Local discontent with this system was eventually reinforced by international pressure  following the end of the Cold War  The first multi party democratic elections were held in 1993 with resources provided by the country s donors and help from the UN Office for Electoral Affairs  and brought Ange F lix Patass  to power  He lost popular support during his presidency and was overthrown in 2003 by French backed General Fran ois Boziz   who went on to win a democratic election in May 2005  Inability to pay workers in the public sector led to strikes in 2007  forcing the resignation of Boziz  in early 2008  A new Prime Minister  Faustin Archange Touad ra  was named on 22 January 2008  Despite its significant mineral resources  uranium reserve in Bakouma  crude oil  gold  diamonds  lumber  hydropower  5  and its arable land  the Central African Republic remains one of the poorest countries in the world and among the ten poorest countries in Africa  The Human Development Index for the Central African Republic is 0 343  which gives the country a rank of 179 out of 187 countries with data  6  Contents 1 History 1 1 Early history 1 2 Exposure to the outside world 1 3 French

Between about 1000 BC and 1000 AD  Ubangian speaking peoples spread eastward from Cameroon to Sudan and settled in most of the territory of the CAR  During the same period  a much smaller number of Bantu speaking immigrants settled in Southwestern CAR and some Central Sudanic speaking populations settled along the Oubangi  The majority of the CAR s inhabitants thus speak Ubangian languages or Bantu languages belonging to the Niger Congo family  A minority speak Central Sudanic languages of the Nilo Saharan family  More recent immigrants include many Muslim merchants who most often speak Arabic or Hausa   edit  Exposure to the outside world Until the early 19th century  the peoples of the CAR lived beyond the expanding Islamic frontier in the Sudanic zone of Africa and thus had relatively little contact with Abrahamic religions or northern economies  During the first decades of the 19th century  however  Muslim traders began increasingly to penetrate the region of the CAR and to cultivate special relations with local leaders in order to facilitate their trade and settlement in the region  The initial arrival of Muslim traders in the early 19th century was relatively peaceful and depended upon the support of local peoples  but after about 1850  slave traders with well armed soldiers began to penetrate the region  Between c  1860 and 1910  slave traders from Sudan  Chad  Cameroon  Dar al Kuti in Northern CAR and Nzakara and Zande states in Southeastern CAR exported much of the population of Eastern CAR  a region with very few inhabitants today   edit  French colonialism Main article  Ubangi Shari This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Oubangui Chari in 1910 European penetration of Central African territory began in the late 19th century during the so called Scramble for Africa  c  1875 1900   Count Savorgnan de Brazza took the lead in establishing the French Congo with headquarters in the city named after him  Brazzaville  and sent expeditions up the Ubangi River in an effort to expand France s claims to territory in Central Africa  King Leopold II of Belgium  Germany and the United Kingdom also competed to establish their claims to territory in the Central African region  In 1889 the French established a post on the Ubangi River at Bangui  the future capital of Ubangi Shari and the CAR  De Brazza then sent expeditions in 1890 91 up the Sangha River in what is now Southwestern CAR  up the center of the Ubangi basin toward Lake Chad  and eastward along the Ubangi River toward the Nile  De Brazza and the pro colonial in France wished to expand the borders of the French Congo to link up with French territories in West Africa  North Africa and East Africa  In 1894  the French Congo s borders with Leopold II s Congo Free State and German Cameroon were fixed by diplomatic agreements  Then  in 1899  the French Congo s border with Sudan was fixed along the Congo Nile watershed  leaving France without her much coveted outlet on the Nile and turning Southeastern Ubangi Shari into a cul de sac  Once European negotiators agreed upon the borders of the French Congo  France had to decide how to pay for the costly occupation  administration  and development of the territory  The reported financial successes of Leopold II s concessionary companies in the Congo Free State convinced the French government in 1899 to grant 17 private companies large concessions in the Ubangi Shari region  In return for the right to exploit these lands by buying local products and selling European goods  the companies promised to pay rent to the colonial state and to promote the development of their concessions  The companies employed European and African agents who frequently used extremely brutal methods to force Central Africans to work for them  At the same time  the French colonial administration began to force Central Africans to pay taxes and to provide the state with free labor  The companies and French administration often collaborated in their efforts to force Central Africans to work for their benefit  but they also often found themselves at odds  Some French officials reported abuses committed by private company militias and even by their own colonial colleagues and troops  but efforts to bring these criminals to justice almost always failed  When news of atrocities committed against Central Africans by concessionary company employees and colonial officials or troops reached France and caused an outcry  there were investigations and some feeble attempts at reform  but the situation on the ground in Ubangi Shari remained essentially the same  Stamp from 1924 In the meantime  during the first decade of French colonial rule  c  1900 1910   the rulers of African states in the Ubangi Shari region increased their slave raiding activities and also their sale of local products to European companies and the colonial state  They took advantage of their treaties with the French to procure more weapons which were used to capture more slaves and so much of the eastern half of Ubangi Shari was depopulated as a result of the export of Central Africans by local rulers during the first decade of colonial rule  Those who had power  Africans and Europeans  often made life miserable for those who did not have the power to resist  During the second decade of colonial rule  c  1910 1920   armed employees of private companies and the colonial state continued to use brutal methods to deal with local populations who resisted forced labor but the power of local African rulers was destroyed and so slave raiding was greatly diminished  In 1911  the Sangha and Lobaye basins were ceded to Germany as part of an agreement which gave France a free hand in Morocco and so Western Ubangi Shari came under German rule until World War I  during which France reconquered this territory by using Central African troops  The third decade of colonial rule  1920 1930  was a period of transition during which a network of roads was built  cash crops were promoted  mobile health services were formed to combat sleeping sickness  and Protestant missions established stations in different parts of the country  New forms of forced labor were also introduced  however  as the French conscripted large numbers of Ubangians to work on the Congo Ocean Railway and many of these recruits died of exhaustion and illness  In 1925 the French writer Andr  Gide published Voyage au Congo in which he described the alarming consequences of conscription for the Congo Ocean railroad and exposed the continuing atrocities committed against Central Africans in Western Ubangi Shari by employees of the Forestry Company of Sangha Ubangi  for example  In 1928 a major insurrection  the Kongo Wara  war of the hoe handle  broke out in Western Ubangi Shari and continued for several years  The extent of this insurrection  perhaps the largest anti colonial rebellion in Africa during the interwar years  was carefully hidden from the French public because it provided evidence  once again  of strong opposition to French colonial rule and forced labor  During the fourth decade of colonial rule  c  1930 1940   cotton  tea  and coffee emerged as important cash crops in Ubangi Shari and the mining of diamonds and gold began in earnest  Several cotton companies were granted purchasing monopolies over large areas of cotton production and were thus able to fix the prices paid to cultivators in order to assure profits for their shareholders  Europeans established coffee plantations and Central Africans also began to cultivate coffee  The fifth decade of colonial rule  c  1940 1950  was shaped by the Second World War and the political reforms which followed in its wake  In September 1940 pro Gaullist French officers took control of Ubangi Shari   edit  Independence On 1 December 1958 the colony of Ubangi Shari became an autonomous territory within the French Community and took the name Central African Republic  The founding father and president of the Conseil de Gouvernement  Barth l my Boganda  died in a mysterious plane accident in 1959  just eight days before the last elections of the colonial era  On 13 August 1960 the Central African Republic gained its independence and two of Boganda s closest aides  Abel Goumba and David Dacko  became involved in a power struggle  With the backing of the French  Dacko took power and soon had Goumba arrested  By 1962 President Dacko had established a one party state  Jean B del Bokassa On 31 December 1965 Dacko was overthrown in the Saint Sylvestre coup d  tat by Colonel Jean B del Bokassa  who suspended the constitution and dissolved the National Assembly  President Bokassa declared himself President For Life in 1972  and named himself Emperor Bokassa I of the Central African Empire on 4 December 1976  A year later  Emperor Bokassa crowned himself in a lavish and expensive ceremony that was ridiculed by much of the world  In 1979 France carried out a coup against Bokassa and  restored  Dacko to power  Dacko  in turn  was overthrown in a coup by General Andr  Kolingba on 1 September 1981  Kolingba suspended the constitution and ruled with a military junta until 1985  He introduced a new constitution in 1986 which was adopted by a nationwide referendum  Membership in his new party  the Rassemblement D mocratique Centrafricain  RDC  was voluntary  In 1987  semi competitive elections to parliament were held and municipal elections were held in 1988  Kolingba s two major political opponents  Abel Goumba and Ange F lix Patass   boycotted these elections because their parties were not allowed to compete  By 1990  inspired by the fall of the Berlin Wall  a pro democracy movement became very active  In May 1990 a letter signed by 253 prominent citizens asked for the convocation of a National Conference but Kolingba refused this request and detained several opponents  Pressure from the United States  more reluctantly from France  and from a group of locally represented countries and agencies called GIBAFOR  France  USA  Germany  Japan  EU  World Bank and UN  finally led Kolingba to agree  in principle  to hold free elections in October 1992  with help from the UN Office of Electoral Affairs  After using the excuse of alleged irregularities to suspend the results of the elections as a pretext for holding on to power  President Kolingba came under intense pressure from GIBAFOR to establish a  Conseil National Politique Provisoire de la R publique   Provisional National Political Council   CNPPR  and to set up a  Mixed Electoral Commission  which included representatives from all political parties  When elections were finally held in 1993  again with the help of the international community  Ange F lix Patass  led in the first round and Kolingba came in fourth behind Abel Goumba and David Dacko  In the second round  Patass  won 53 percent of the vote while Goumba won 45 6 percent  Most of Patass  s support came from Gbaya  Kare and Kaba voters in seven heavily populated prefectures in the northwest while Goumba s support came largely from ten less populated prefectures in the south and east  Furthermore  Patass  s party  the Mouvement pour la Lib ration du Peuple Centrafricain  MLPC  or Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People gained a simple but not an absolute majority of seats in parliament  which meant Patass  needed coalition partners  Patass  relieved former President Kolingba of his military rank of general in March 1994 and then charged several former ministers with various crimes  Patass  also removed many Yakoma from important  lucrative posts in the government  Two hundred mostly Yakoma members of the presidential guard were also dismissed or reassigned to the army  Kolingba s RDC loudly proclaimed that Patass  s government was conducting a  witch hunt  against the Yakoma  A new constitution was approved on 28 December 1994 and promulgated on 14 January 1995  but this constitution  like those before it  did not have much impact on the practice of politics  In 1996 1997  reflecting steadily decreasing public confidence in its erratic behaviour  three mutinies against Patass  s government were accompanied by widespread destruction of property and heightened ethnic tension  On 25 January 1997  the Bangui Peace Accords were signed which provided for the deployment of an inter African military mission  the Mission Interafricaine de Surveillance des Accords de Bangui  MISAB   Mali s former president  Amadou Tour   served as chief mediator and brokered the entry of ex mutineers into the government on 7 April 1997  The MISAB mission was later replaced by a U N  peacekeeping force  the Mission des Nations Unies en RCA  MINURCA   In 1998 parliamentary elections resulted in Kolingba  RDC winning 20 out of 109 seats  which constituted a comeback  but in 1999  notwithstanding widespread public anger in urban centers with his corrupt rule  Patass  won free elections to become president for a second term  On 28 May 2001 rebels stormed strategic buildings in Bangui in an unsuccessful coup attempt  The army chief of staff  Abel Abrou  and General Fran ois N Djadder Bedaya were shot  but Patass  regained the upper hand by bringing in at least 300 troops of the rebel leader Jean Pierre Bemba  from across the river in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  and by Libyan soldiers  In the aftermath of this failed coup  militias loyal to Patass  sought revenge against rebels in many neighborhoods of the capital  Bangui  that resulted in the destruction of many homes as well as the torture and murder of many opponents  Eventually Patass  came to suspect that General Fran ois Boziz  was involved in another coup attempt against him and so Boziz  fled with loyal troops to Chad  In March 2003  Boziz  launched a surprise attack against Patass   who was out of the country  Libyan troops and some 1 000 soldiers of Bemba s Congolese rebel organization failed to stop the rebels  who took control of the country and thus succeeded in overthrowing Patass   Fran ois Boziz  suspended the constitution and named a new cabinet which included most opposition parties  Abel Goumba   Mr  Clean   was named vice president  which gave Boziz  s new government a positive image  Boziz  established a broad based National Transition Council to draft a new constitution and announced that he would step down and run for office once the new constitution was approved  A national dialogue was held from 15 September to 27 October 2003  and Boziz  won a fair election that excluded Patass   to be elected president on a second ballot  in May 2005   edit  Humanitarian aid  peacebuilding  and development The Central African Republic is heavily dependent upon multilateral foreign aid and the presence of numerous NGOs which provide services which the government fails to provide  As one UNDP official put it  the CAR is a country  sous serum   or a country metaphorically hooked up to an IV   Mehler 2005 150   The very presence of numerous foreign personnel and organizations in the country  including peacekeepers and even refugee camps  provides an important source of revenue for many Central Africans  citation needed  The country is self sufficient in food crops  but much of the population lives at a subsistence level  Livestock development is hindered by the presence of the tsetse fly  In 2006 due to ongoing violence  over 50 000 in

Republic became the fourth country to be placed on the agenda of the UN Peacebuilding Commission  8  which was set up in 2005 to help countries emerging from conflict avoid the slide back into war or chaos  The 31 member body agreed to take up the situation after a request from the government   edit  Peacebuilding Fund The Secretary General Ban Ki Moon declared on 8 January 2008 that the Central African Republic was eligible to receive assistance from the Peacebuilding Fund  9  Three priority areas were identified  1  Security sector reform 2  Promotion of good governance and the rule of law and 3  Revitalization of communities affected by conflicts   edit  Politics Bangui airport Main articles  Politics of the Central African Republic and Central African Republic Council of Ministers

Thousands of refugees fled their homes  caught in the crossfire of battles between government troops and rebel forces  More than 7 000 people fled to neighboring Chad  Those who remained in the CAR told of government troops systematically killing men and boys suspected of cooperating with rebels  13  In March 2010  Fran ois Boziz  signed a decree declaring presidential elections on 25 April 2010

the countries of Cameroon  Chad  Sudan  South Sudan  the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo  The country lies between latitudes 2  and 11 N  and longitudes 14  and 28 E  Much of the Central African Republic consists of flat  or rolling plateau savanna  typically about 500 metres  1 640 ft  above sea level  of which most of the northern half lies within the World Wildlife Fund s East Sudanian savanna ecoregion  In the northeast are the Fertit Hills  and there are scattered hills in the southwest part of the country  To the northwest is the Yade Massif  a granite plateau with an altitude of 1 143 feet  348 m   At 622 941 square kilometres  240 519 sq mi   the Central African Republic is the world s 42nd largest country  It is comparable in size to the Ukraine  and is somewhat smaller than the US state of Texas  Much of the southern border is formed by tributaries of the Congo River  with the Mbomou River in the east merging with the Uele River to form the Ubangi River  In the west  the Sangha River flows through part of the country  The eastern border lies along the edge of the Nile River watershed  Estimates of the amount of the country covered by forest ranges up to 8   with the densest parts in the south  The forest is highly diverse  and includes commercially important species of Ayous  Sapelli and Sipo  20  The deforestation rate is 0 4  per annum  and lumber poaching is commonplace  21  In the November 2008 issue of National Geographic  the Central African Republic was named the country least affected by light pollution   edit  Climate Main article  Climate of the Central African Republic The climate of the C A R  is generally tropical  The northern areas are subject to harmattan winds  which are hot  dry  and carry dust  The northern regions have been subject to desertification  and the northeast is a desert  The remainder of the country is prone to flooding from nearby rivers   edit  Economy Main article  Economy of the Central African Republic Lettuce watering in northern Central African Republic  The economy of the CAR is dominated by the cultivation and sale of food crops such as cassava  peanuts  maize  sorghum  millet  sesame  and plantain  The annual real GDP growth rate is just above 3   The importance of food crops over exported cash crops is indicated by the fact that the total production of cassava  the staple food of most Central Africans  ranges between 200 000 and 300 000 tons a year  while the production of cotton  the principal exported cash crop  ranges from 25 000 to 45 000 tons a year  Food crops are not exported in large quantities but they still constitute the principal cash crops of the country because Central Africans derive far more income from the periodic sale of surplus food crops than from exported cash crops such as cotton or coffee  citation needed  The CAR s largest import partner is South Korea  20 2    followed by France  13 6   and Cameroon  7 7    while its largest export partner is Japan  40 4    followed by Belgium  9 8   and China  8 2    22  23  Many rural and urban women also transform food crops into alcoholic drinks such as sorghum beer or hard liquor and derive considerable income from the sale of these drinks  Much of the income derived from the sale of foods and alcohol is not  on the books  and thus is not considered in calculating per capita income  which is one reason why official figures for per capita income are not accurate in the case of the CAR  The per capita income of the CAR is often listed as being around  300 a year  said to be one of the lowest in the world  but this figure is based mostly on reported sales of exports and largely ignores the more important but unregistered sale of foods  locally produced alcohol  diamonds  ivory  bushmeat  and traditional medicine  for example  The informal economy of the CAR is more important than the formal economy for most Central Africans  citation needed  Diamonds constitute the most important export of the CAR  accounting for 40 55  of export revenues  but an estimated 30 50  of the diamonds produced each year leave the country clandestinely  Export trade is hindered by poor economic development  and the location of this country far from the coast  citation needed  The wilderness regions of this country have potential as ecotourist destinations
