Indiana  i  ndi  n    is a US state  admitted to the United States as the 19th on December 11  1816  It is located in the midwestern and Great Lakes regions of North America  Indiana is the 38th largest by area and the 15th most populous of the 50 United States  Indiana is the least extensive state in the continental US west of the Appalachian Mountains  Its capital and largest city is Indianapolis  the second largest of any state capital and largest state capital east of the Mississippi River  Before it became a territory  varying cultures of indigenous peoples and historic Native Americans inhabited Indiana for thousands of years  Angel Mounds State Historic Site  one of the best preserved ancient earthwork mound sites in the United States  can be found in Southwestern Indiana near Evansville  5  Residents of Indiana are known as Hoosiers  The etymology of the word is disputed  but the leading theory as advanced by the Indiana Historical Bureau and the Indiana Historical Society has  Hoosier  originating from the upland South region of the U S  as a derogatory slang term for a rough countryman  a country bumpkin  6  The state s name means  Land of the Indians   or simply  Indian Land   This name dates back to at least the 1760s but was first applied to the region by the United States Congress when the Indiana Territory was incorporated in 1800  separating it from the Northwest Territory  7  8  Since its founding as a territory  settlement patterns in Indiana have reflected regional cultural segmentation present in the Eastern United States  the state s northernmost tier was settled primarily by people from New England and New York  Central Indiana by migrants from the Mid Atlantic states and from adjacent Ohio  and Southern Indiana by settlers from the Southern states  particularly Kentucky and Tennessee  9  Indiana has a diverse economy with a gross state product of  214 billion in 2005  10  Indiana has several metropolitan areas with populations greater than 100 000 and a number of smaller industrial cities and towns  Indiana is home to several major sports teams and athletic events including the NFL s Indianapolis Colts  the NBA

the Ice Age  Divided into small groups  the Paleo Indians were nomads who hunted large game such as Mastodons  They created stone tools made out of chert by chipping  knapping and flaking  13  The subsequent phase of Indiana s Native American antiquity is called the Archaic period  which occurred between 5000 and 4000 BC  They differed from the Paleo Indians in that they used new tools and techniques to prepare food  Such new tools included different types of spear points and knives  with various forms of notches  They also used ground stone tools such as stone axes  woodworking tools and grinding stones  During the latter part of the period  mounds and middens were created  indicating that their settlements were becoming more permanent  The Archaic period ended at about 1500 BC  although some Archaic people lived until 700 BC  13  Afterwards  the Woodland period took place in Indiana  where various new cultural attributes appeared  During this period  ceramics and pottery were created as well as the increase of usage in horticulture  An early Woodland period group named the Adena people had elegant burial rituals  featuring log tombs beneath earth mounds  In the middle portion of the Woodland period  the Hopewell people began exploration of long range trade of goods  Nearing the end of the stage  an exhaustive cultivation and adaptation of agriculture to grow crops such as corn and squash  The Woodland period ended around 1000 AD  13  The incoming period afterwards was known as the Mississippian period  which lasted from 1000 until just before the arrival of Europeans  During this stage  large settlements were created that had similarities to towns  such as the Angel Mounds  They had large public areas such as plazas and platform mounds  where instrumental individuals of the settlement lived or conducted rituals  Mississippian civilization collapsed in Indiana during the mid 1400s for reasons that remain unclear  13  Native Americans guide French explorers through Indiana as depicted by Maurice Thompson in Stories of Indiana  French explorer Ren  Robert Cavelier  Sieur de La Salle was the first European to cross into Indiana after reaching present day South Bend at the Saint Joseph River in 1679  14  He returned the following year to gain knowledge of northern Indiana  Canadiens fur traders also came along and brought blankets  jewelry  tools  whiskey and weapons to trade for skins with the Native Americans  By 1702  the first trading post was established by Sieur Juchereau near Vincennes  In 1715  Sieur de Vincennes built Fort Miami at Kekionga  now Fort Wayne  In 1717  another Canadien  Picote de Beletre  built Fort Ouiatenon on the Wabash River  with the efforts to control Native American trade routes from Lake Erie to the Mississippi River  In 1732  Sieur de Vincennes built a second fur trading post at Vincennes  Canadien settlers  which had left the earlier post because of hostilities  came back in larger numbers  In a period of a few years however  the British arrived and contended against the Canadians for management of the fruitful fur trade  Fighting between the Canadians and British occurred throughout the 1750s as a result  Iroquois conquests during the Beaver Wars  mid 1600 s   which largely depopulated Ohio River valley  15  The Native American tribes of Indiana sided with the Canadians during the French and Indian War  By the conclusion of the war in 1763  the French had lost all land west of the colonies  and control had been ceded to the British crown  Neighboring tribes in Indiana  however  did not give up and destroyed Fort Ouiatenon and Fort Miami during Pontiac s Rebellion  The royal proclamation of 1763 ceded the land west of the Appalachians for Indian use  and was thus labeled Indian territory  In 1775  the American Revolutionary War began as the colonists looked to free themselves from British rule  The majority of the fighting took place in the east  but military officer George Rogers Clark called for an army to help fight the British in the west  16  Clark s army won significant battles to overtake Vincennes and Fort Sackville on February 25  1779  17  During the war  Clark managed to cut off British troops who were attacking the colonist from the west  His success is often credited for changing the course of the American Revolutionary War  18  At the end of the revolutionary war  through the treaty of Paris  the British crown ceded their claims to the land south of the Great Lakes to the newly formed United States  Present day Indiana became part of the Northwest Territory in 1787  In 1800  Ohio was separated from the Northwest Territory by Congress  designating the rest of the land as the Indiana Territory  19  President Thomas Jefferson chose William Henry Harrison as the governor of the territory and Vincennes was established as the capital  20  After Michigan was separated and the Illinois Territory was formed  the size of Indiana was reduced to its current state  19  In 1810  Shawnee leader Tecumseh and his brother Tenskwatawa encouraged other tribes to resist European settlement into the territory  Tensions rose and Harrison was authorized to launch a preemptive expedition against Tecumseh s Confederacy resulting in a US victory at the Battle of Tippecanoe on November 7  1811  Tecumseh was killed in 1813 during the Battle of Thames  After his death  armed resistance to United States control ended in the region  Most Native Americans in the state were later removed through negotiations to purchase their lands in the 1820s and 1830s  21  In December 1813  Corydon became the second capital of the Indiana Territory  19  Two years later  a petition for statehood was approved by the territorial general assembly and sent to Congress  Afterwards  an Enabling Act was passed to provide an election of delegates to write a constitution for Indiana  On June 10  1816  delegates assembled at Corydon to write the constitution  which was completed in nineteen days  President James Madison approved Indiana s admission into the union as the nineteenth state on December 11  1816  17  In 1825  the state capital was moved from Corydon to Indianapolis and 26 years later  a second constitution was adopted  19  Following statehood  the new government set out on an ambitious plan to transform Indiana from a wilderness frontier into a developed  well populated  and thriving state  beginning significant demographic and economic changes  The state s founders initiated a program that led to the construction of roads  canals  railroads and state funded public schools  The plans bankrupted the state and were a financial disaster  but increased land and produce value more than fourfold  22  The early nineteenth century saw much immigration to Indiana  The largest immigrant group to settle in Indiana were Germans  though there were also substantial numbers of immigrants from Ireland and England as well as Americans who were ethnically English from regions such as New York  New England and Pennsylvania  23  24  Child laborers in glassworks  by Lewis Hine  Indiana  August 1908  During the American Civil War  Indiana became politically influential and played an important role in the affairs of the nation  As the first western state to mobilize for the war  Indiana s soldiers were present in all of the major engagements during the war  Indiana residents were present in both the first and last battles and the state provided 126 infantry regiments  26 batteries of artillery and 13 regiments of cavalry to the cause of the Union  25  In 1861  Indiana was assigned a quota of 7 500 men to join the Union Army  26  So many volunteered in the first call that thousands had to be turned away  Before the war ended  Indiana contributed 208 367 men to fight and serve in the war  Casualties were over 35  among these men  24 416 lost their lives in the conflict and over 50 000 more were wounded  27  The only Civil War battle fought in Indiana was the Battle of Corydon  which occurred during Morgan s Raid  The battle left 15 dead  40 wounded  and 355 captured  28  Following the American Civil War  Indiana industry began to grow at an accelerated rate across the northern part of the state leading to the formation of labor unions and suffrage movements  29  The Indiana Gas Boom led to rapid industrialization during the late 19th century by providing cheap fuel to the region  30  In the early 20th century  Indiana developed into a strong manufacturing state with strong ties to the auto industry  23 Haynes Apperson  the nations first commercially successful auto company operated in Kokomo until 1925  The state also saw many developments with the construction of Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the start many other auto industries  31  During the 1930s  Indiana  like the rest of the nation  was affected by the Great Depression  The economic downturn had a wide ranging negative impact on Indiana  such as the decline of urbanization  The situation was aggravated by the Dust Bowl  which caused an influx of migrants from the rural Midwestern United States  Governor Paul V  McNutt s administration struggled to build a state funded welfare system to help the overwhelmed private charities  During his administration  spending and taxes were both cut drastically in response to the depression and the state government was completely reorganized  McNutt also ended Prohibition in the state and enacted the state s first income tax  On several occasions  he declared martial law to put an end to worker strikes  32  World War II helped lift the economy in Indiana  as the war required steel  food and other goods that were produced in Indiana  33  Roughly 10 percent of Indiana s population joined the armed forces while hundreds of industries earned war production contracts and began making war material  34  The effects of the war helped end the Great Depression  33  With the conclusion of World War II  Indiana rebounded to levels of production prior to the Great Depression  Industry became the primary employer  a trend that continued into the 1960s  Urbanization during the 1950s and 1960s led to substantial growth in the state s urban centers  The auto  steel and pharmaceutical industries topped Indiana s major businesses  Indiana s population continued to grow during the years after the war  exceeding five million by the 1970 census  35  In the 1960s  the administration of Matthew E  Welsh adopted its first sales tax of two percent  36  Indiana schools had been desegregated in 1949  Welsh also worked with the General Assembly to pass the Indiana Civil Rights Bill  granting equal protection to minorities in seeking employment  37  Beginning in 1970  a series of amendments to the state constitution were proposed  With adoption  the Indiana Court of Appeals was created and the procedure of appointing justices on the courts was adjusted  38  The 1973 oil crisis created a recession that hurt the automotive industry in Indiana  Companies like Delco Electronics and Delphi began a long series of downsizing that contributed to high unemployment rates in manufacturing in Anderson  Muncie  and Kokomo  The deindustrialization trend continued until the 1980s when the national and state economy began to diversify and recover  39   edit  Geography Main article  Geography of Indiana See also  List of Indiana rivers  Watersheds of Indiana  and List of counties in Indiana Perfectly square quarter sections of

some low hills and the soil is composed of glacial sands  gravel and clay  which results to exceptional farmland in central Indiana  42  The unglaciated segment of the state carries a different and off balance surface  characterized in places by profound valleys and expeditious streams  A limited area in the southeastern area of the state possesses these types of characteristics  The soil is fertile in the valleys of Indiana  most notably Whitewater Valley which is known for its prodigious farming  In northwest Indiana  there are various sand hills and dunes  due in some measure to a former extension of the lake and wind action  In the basin of the Kankakee River there is an extensive scope of lakes  marshes and prairies  In northeastern Indiana there is a region of tall moraines  one of which is 200 to 500 feet  61 to 150 m  deep  25 miles  40 km  wide and stretching across a distance of 100 miles  160 km   49  The Wabash River  which is the longest free flowing river east of

only ten states to support Republican Wendell Willkie in 1940  42  On 14 occasions has the Republican candidate defeated the Democrat by a double digit margin in the state  including six times where a Republican won the state by more than 20   110  In 2000 and 2004  George W  Bush won the state by a wide margin while the election was much closer overall  The state has only supported a Democrat for president five times since 1900  In 1912  Woodrow Wilson became the first Democrat to win the state with 43  of the vote  20 years later  Franklin D  Roosevelt won the state with 55  of the vote over incumbent Republican Herbert Hoover  Roosevelt won the state again in 1936  In 1964  56  of voters supported Democrat Lyndon B  Johnson over Republican Barry Goldwater  44 years later  Democrat Barack

Before Mitch Daniels became governor in 2005  Democrats had held the office for 16 consecutive years  Indiana elects two senators and nine representatives to Congress  The state has 11 electoral votes in presidential elections  110  Seven of the districts favor the Republican Party according to the CPVI rankings  there are currently six Republicans serving as representatives and three Democrats  Historically  Republicans have been strongest in the eastern and central portions of the state  while Democrats have been strongest in the northwestern part of the state  Occasionally  certain counties in the southern part of the state will vote Democratic  Marion County  Indiana s most populated county  supported the Republican candidates from 1968 to 2000  before backing the Democrats in the 2004 and 2008 elections  Indiana s second most populated county  Lake County  is a strong supporter of the Democratic party that has not voted for a Republican since 1972  110  In 2005  the Bay

was  275 7 billion  114  A high percentage of Indiana s income is from manufacturing  115  The Calumet region of northwest Indiana is the largest steel producing area in the U S  Indiana s other manufactures include pharmaceuticals and medical devices  automobiles  electrical equipment  transportation equipment  chemical products  rubber  petroleum and coal products  and factory machinery  Despite its reliance on manufacturing  Indiana has been much less affected by declines in traditional Rust Belt manufactures than many of its neighbors  The explanation appears to be certain factors in the labor market  First  much of the heavy manufacturing  such as industrial machinery and steel  requires highly skilled labor  and firms are often willing to locate where hard to train skills already exist  Second  Indiana s labor force is located primarily in medium sized and smaller cities rather than in very large and expensive metropolises  This makes it possible for firms to offer somewhat lower wages for these skills than would normally be paid  Firms often see in Indiana a chance to obtain higher than average skills at lower than average wages  116  Indiana is home to the international headquarters and research facilities of pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly in Indianapolis  the state s largest corporation  as well as the world headquarters of Mead Johnson Nutritionals in Evansville  117  Overall  Indiana ranks fifth among all U S  states in total sales and shipments of pharmaceutical products and second highest in the number of biopharmaceutical related jobs  118  Indiana is located within the U S  Corn Belt and Grain Belt  The state has a feedlot style system raising corn to fatten hogs and cattle  Along with corn  soybeans are also a major cash crop  Its proximity to large urban centers  such as Indianapolis and Chicago  assure that dairying  egg production  and specialty horticulture occur  Other crops include melons  tomatoes  grapes  mint  popping corn  and tobacco in the southern counties  119  Most of the original land was not prairie and had to be cleared of deciduous trees  Many parcels of woodland remain and support a furniture making sector in the southern portion of the state  In 2011 Indiana was ranked first in the Midwest and sixth in the country for best places to do business according to CEO magazine  120   edit  State budget

has a Rainy Day Fund and for healthy reserves proportional to spending  Indiana is one of the few states in the U S  which do not allow a line item veto  Indiana does not use Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  Indiana has a flat state income tax rate of 3 4   Many Indiana counties also collect income tax  The state sales tax rate is 7  with exemptions for food  prescription medications and over the counter medications  121  In some jurisdictions an additional Food and Beverage Tax is charged  at a rate of 1   Marion County s rate is 2    on sales of prepared meals and beverages  122 Property taxes are imposed on both real and personal property in Indiana and are administered by the Department of Local Government Finance  Property is subject to taxation by a variety of taxing units  schools  counties  townships  cities and towns  libraries   making the total tax rate the sum of the tax rates imposed by all taxing units in which a property is located  However  a  circuit breaker  law enacted on March 19  2008 limits property taxes to one percent of assessed value for homeowners  two percent for rental properties and farmland and three percent for businesses  In Fiscal year 2011 Indiana reported one of the largest surpluses among U S states  with an extra  1 2 billion in its accounts  Gov  Mitch Daniels  a Republican  authorized bonus payments of up to  1 000 for state employees on Friday  July 15  2011  An employee who  meets expectations  will get  500  those who  exceed expectations  will receive  750 and  outstanding workers  will see an extra  1

 Indiana has 24 coal power plants  including the largest coal power plant in the United States  Gibson Generating Station  located across the Wabash River from Mount Carmel  Illinois  Indiana is also home to the coal fired plant with the highest sulfur dioxide emissions in the United States  the Gallagher power plant just west of New Albany  124  The state has an estimated coal reserves of fifty seven billion tons  state mining operations produces thirty five million tons of coal annually  125  While Indiana has made commitments to increasing use of renewable resources such as wind  hydroelectric  biomass  or solar power  however  progress has been very slow  mainly because of the continued abundance of coal in Southern Indiana  Most of the new plants in the state have been coal gasification plants  Another source is hydroelectric power  Solar power and wind power are being investigated  and geothermal power is being used commercially  New estimates in 2006 raised the wind capacity for Indiana from 30 MW at 50 m turbine height to 40 000 MW at 70 m  which could double at 100 m  the height of newer turbines  126  As of the end of June 2008  Indiana has installed 130 MW of

approval of  48 million in federal funding over the next ten years  129  The Terre Haute International Airport has no airlines operating out of the facility but is used for private flying  Since 1954  the 181st Fighter Wing of the Indiana Air National Guard has been stationed at the airport  However  the Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  Proposal of 2005 stated that the 181st would lose its

of the state s motto  the Crossroads of America  There are also many state highways maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation  These are numbered according to the same convention as U S  Highways  Indiana allows highways of different classifications to have the same number  For example  Interstate 64 and State Road 64 both exist  rather close to each other  in Indiana  but are two distinct roads with no relation to one another   edit  County roads Most Indiana counties use a grid based system to identify county roads  this system replaced the older arbitrary system of road numbers and names  and  among other things  makes it much easier to identify the sources of calls placed to the 9 1 1 system  Such systems are easier to implement in the glacially flattened northern and central portions of the state  Rural counties in the southern third of the state are less likely to have grids and more likely to rely on unsystematic road names  e g   Crawford  Harrison  Perry  Scott  and Washington Counties   there are also counties in the northern portions of the state that have never implemented a grid  or have only partially implemented one  Some counties are also laid out in an almost diamond like grid system  e g  Clark  Floyd  Gibson  and Knox Counties   Such a system is also almost useless in those situations as well  Knox County once operated two different grid systems for county roads because the county was laid out using two different survey grids  but has since decided to use road names and combine roads instead  Notably  the county road grid system of St  Joseph County  whose major city is South Bend  uses perennial  tree  names  i e  Ash  Hickory  Ironwood  etc   in alphabetical order for North South roads and Presidential and other noteworthy names  i e  Adams  Edison  Lincoln Way  etc   in alphabetical order for East West roads  There are exceptions to this rule in downtown South Bend and Mishawaka   edit  Rail Indiana has over 4 255 railroad route miles  of which 91 percent are operated by Class I railroads  principally CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway  Other Class I railroads in Indiana include the Canadian National

Line is one of the country s most notable commuter rail systems extending from Chicago to South Bend  Indiana is currently implementing an extensive rail plan that was prepared in 2002 by the Parsons Corporation  131  Many recreational trails  such as the Monon Trail in Indianapolis  have been created from abandoned rails routes   edit  Ports Indiana annually ships over 70 million tons of cargo by water each year  which ranks 14th among all U S  states  More than half of Indiana s border is water  which includes 400 miles  640 km  of direct access to two major freight transportation arteries  the Great Lakes St  Lawrence Seaway  via Lake Michigan  and the Inland Waterway System  via the Ohio River   The Ports of Indiana manages three major ports which include Burns Harbor  Jeffersonville  and Mount Vernon  132   edit  Education Indiana s 1816 constitution was the first in the country to implement a state funded public school system  It also allotted one township for a public university  133  However  the plan turned out to be far too idealistic for a pioneer society  as tax money was not accessible for its organization  In the 1840s  Caleb Mills pressed the need for tax supported schools  and in 1851 his advice was included in the new state constitution  Although the growth of the public school system was held up by legal entanglements  many public elementary schools were in use by 1870  Most children in Indiana attend public schools  but nearly 10  attend private schools and parochial schools  About one half of all college students in Indiana are enrolled in state supported four year schools  The largest institution is Indiana University  the flagship campus of which was endorsed as Indiana Seminary in 1820  Indiana State University was established as the state s Normal School in 1865  Purdue University was chartered as a land grant college in 1869  The three other independent state universities are Vincennes University  1802   Ball State University  1918  and University of Southern Indiana  1965   Many of the private colleges and universities in Indiana are affiliated with religious groups  The University of Notre Dame and the University of Saint Francis are popular Roman Catholic schools  Universities affiliated with Protestant denominations include Anderson University  Butler University  Taylor University  DePauw University  Earlham College  Valparaiso University  93  and University of Evansville  134  Taylor University has been ranked first in the guide s America s Best Colleges among 109 Midwest Regional Colleges for five years in a row

Bankers Life Fieldhouse  they began play in 1967 in the American Basketball Association  ABA  and joined the NBA when the leagues merged in 1976  Although James Naismith developed basketball in Springfield  Massachusetts  in 1891  Indiana is where high school basketball was born  In 1925  Naismith visited an Indiana basketball state finals game along with 15 000 screaming fans and later
