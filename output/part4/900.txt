Discrimination portal v t e Racism is the belief that inherent different traits in human racial groups justify discrimination  In the modern English language  the term  racism  is used predominantly as a pejorative epithet  It is applied especially to the practice or advocacy of racial discrimination of a pernicious nature  i e   which harms particular groups of people   and which is often justified by recourse to racial stereotyping or pseudo science  Racism is popularly associated with various activities that are illegal or commonly considered harmful  such as extremism  hatred  xenophobia   malignant or forced  exploitation  separatism  racial supremacy  mass murder  for the purpose of genocide   genocide denial  vigilantism  hate crimes  terrorism   etc  Modern usage often equates  racism  and  racial discrimination  and defines the latter term only as applying to pernicious practices  Differential treatment of racial groups that is intended to ameliorate past discrimination  rather than to harm  goes by other names  e g   affirmative action   the characterization of this practice as  racism    racial discrimination  or  reverse discrimination  is normally only done by its opponents  and typically implies a belief in the harmful nature of the practice with respect to the groups not receiving assistance   Racism  and  racial discrimination  are often used to describe discrimination on an ethnic or cultural basis  independent of their somatic  i e    racial   differences  According to the United Nations conventions  there is no distinction between the term racial discrimination and ethnicity discrimination  1  In politics  racism is commonly located on the far right due to the far right s common association with nativism  racism  and xenophobia  2  However  racism has occurred in progressive politics such as the historical concept of White Man s Burden by Rudyard Kipling that claimed that whites had a moral obligation to bring civilization to allegedly barbaric  savage  non white societies that were deemed as backward in comparison to white societies  and historically by liberal figures such as John Stuart Mill who denounced Hindu civilization in India as a backwards feudal society and saw Europeans as superior in terms of development of civilization to Hindus  thus legitimizing the right of the British to imperial rule in India  3  Contents 1 Usage of the term and related terms 2 Definitions 2 1 Legal 2 2 Sociological 2 3 Xenophobia 2 4 Supremacism 2 5 Segregationism 3 Types 3 1 Racial discrimination 3 2 Institutional

Discrimination 13 See also 14 References  amp  notes 15 Further reading 16 External links Usage of the term and related terms In the 19th century  many scientists subscribed to the simple belief that human populations are divided into separate races  4  This was often used to justify the belief that some races were inferior to others  and that differential treatment was consequently justified  5  6  7  Such theories are generally termed scientific racism  When the practice of treating certain groups preferentially or denying others rights or benefits based on racial characteristics is institutionalized  it is termed  institutional racism   Nowadays  most biologists  anthropologists  and sociologists reject a simple taxonomy of races in favor of more specific and or empirically verifiable criteria  such as geography  ethnicity  or a history of endogamy  8  Those who subscribe to the proposition that there are inherent distinctions among people that can be ascribed to membership in a racial group  and who may use this to justify differential treatment of such groups  tend to describe themselves using the term  racialism  rather than  racism   to avoid the negative connotations of the latter word   Racialism  is assumed to be more value neutral terminology  and more appropriate for  scientifically  objective communication or analysis  However  this distribution of meanings between the two terms used to be precisely inverse at the time they were coined  The Oxford English Dictionary defined  racialism  as  belief in the superiority of a particular race  and gives a 1907 quote as the first recorded use  The shortened term  racism  did not appear in the English language until the 1930s  9  10  It was first defined by the OED as   t he theory that distinctive human characteristics and abilities are determined by race   which gives 1936 as the first recorded use  Additionally  the OED records racism as a synonym of racialism   belief in the superiority of a particular race   By the end of World War II  racism had acquired the same supremacist connotations former associated with racialism  racism now implied racial discrimination  racial supremacism and a harmful intent   The term  race hatred  had also been used by sociologist Frederick Hertz in the late 1920s   Modeled on the term  racism   a large number of pejorative  ism terms have been created to describe various types of prejudice  sexism  ageism  ableism  speciesism  etc  Related concepts are antisemitism  chauvinism and homophobia  which in turn has led to terms such as Islamophobia   Definitions Racism involves the belief in racial differences  which acts as a justification for non equal treatment  which some regard as  discrimination   of members of that race  5  The term is commonly used negatively and is usually associated with race based prejudice  violence  dislike  discrimination  or oppression  the term can also have varying and contested definitions  Racialism is a related term  sometimes intended to avoid these negative meanings  As a word  racism is an   ism   a belief that can be described by a word ending in the suffix  ism  pertaining to race  As its etymology would suggest  its usage is relatively recent and as such its definition is not entirely settled  The Oxford English Dictionary defines racism as the  belief that all members of each race possess characteristics  abilities  or qualities specific to that race  especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races  and the expression of such prejudice  11  12  while the Merriam Webster s Dictionary defines it as a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority or inferiority of a particular racial group  and alternatively that it is also the prejudice based on such a belief  13  The Macquarie Dictionary defines racism as   the belief that human races have distinctive characteristics which determine their respective cultures  usually involving the idea that one s own race is superior and has the right to rule or dominate others   Legal The UN does not define  racism   however  it does define  racial discrimination   According to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination  the term  racial discrimination  shall mean any distinction  exclusion  restriction  or preference based on race  colour  descent  or national or ethnic origin that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition  enjoyment or exercise  on an equal footing  of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political  economic  social  cultural or any other field of public life  14  This definition does not make any difference between discrimination based on ethnicity and race  in part because the distinction between the two remains debatable among anthropologists  15  Similarly  in British law the phrase racial group means  any group of people who are defined by reference to their race  colour  nationality  including citizenship  or ethnic or national origin   16  Sociological Some sociologists have defined racism as a system of group privilege  In Portraits of White Racism  David Wellman has defined racism as  culturally sanctioned beliefs  which  regardless of intentions involved  defend the advantages whites have because of the subordinated position of racial minorities   17  Sociologists No l A  Cazenave and Darlene Alvarez Maddern define racism as     a highly organized system of  race  based group privilege that operates at every level of society and is held together by a sophisticated ideology of color  race  supremacy  Sellers and Shelton  2003  found that a relationship between racial discrimination and emotional distress was moderated by racial ideology and public regard beliefs  That is  racial centrality appears to promote the degree of discrimination African American young adults perceive whereas racial ideology may buffer the detrimental emotional effects of that discrimination  Racist systems include  but cannot be reduced to  racial bigotry    18  Sociologist and former American Sociological Association president Joe Feagin argues that the United States can be characterized as a  total racist society  19  Police harassment and brutality directed at black men  women  and children are as old as American society  dating back to the days of slavery and Jim Crow segregation  Such police actions across the nation today reveal important aspects of       the commonplace discriminatory practices of individual whites        and  white dominated institutions that allow or encourage such practices    20  Bank of America was fined  335 million for minority discrimination  21  Some sociologists have also pointed out  with reference to the USA and elsewhere  that forms of racism have in many instances mutated from more blatant expressions hereof into more covert kinds  albeit that blatant forms of hatred and discrimination still endure   The  newer   more hidden and less easily detectable  forms of racism which can be considered as embedded in social processes and structures are more difficult to explore as well as challenge  Xenophobia Main article  Xenophobia Dictionary definitions of xenophobia include  deep rooted antipathy towards foreigners  Oxford English Dictionary  OED   unreasonable fear or hatred of the unfamiliar  especially people of other races  Webster s  22  The Dictionary of Psychology defines it as  a fear of strangers   23  Supremacism Main article  Supremacism Centuries of European colonialism of the Americas  Africa and Asia was excused by white supremacist attitudes  24  During the early 20th century  the phrase  The White Man s Burden  was widely used to justify imperialist policy as a noble enterprise  25  26  A rally against school integration in 1959  Segregationism Main article  Racial segregation Racial segregation is the separation of humans into racial groups in daily life  It may apply to activities such as eating in a restaurant  drinking from a water fountain  using a bath room  attending school  going to the movies  or in the rental or purchase of a home  27  Segregation is generally outlawed  but may exist through social norms  even when there is no strong individual preference for it  as suggested by Thomas Schelling s models of segregation and subsequent work  Types Racial discrimination Racial discrimination refers to the separation of people through a process of social division into categories not necessarily related to races for purposes of differential treatment  Racial segregation policies may formalize it  but it is also often exerted without being legalized  Researchers Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan  at the University of Chicago and MIT found in a 2004 study that there was widespread discrimination in the workplace against job applicants whose names were merely perceived as  sounding black   These applicants were 50  less likely than candidates perceived as having  white sounding names  to receive callbacks for interviews  Devah Pager  a sociologist at Princeton University  sent matched pairs of applicants to apply for jobs in Milwaukee and New York City  finding that black applicants received callbacks or job offers at half the rate of equally qualified whites  28  29  In contrast  institutions and courts have upheld discrimination against whites when it is done to promote a diverse work or educational environment  even when it was shown to be to the detriment of qualified applicants  30  31  The researchers view these results as strong evidence of unconscious biases rooted in the United States  long history of discrimination  e g   Jim Crow laws  etc   32  Institutional Further information  Institutional racism  State racism  Affirmative action  Racial profiling  and Racism by country Students protesting against racial quotas in Brazil  The sign reads   Want a vacancy  Pass the Vestibular   Institutional racism  also known as structural racism  state racism or systemic racism  is racial discrimination by governments  corporations  religions  or educational institutions or other large organizations with the power to influence the lives of many individuals  Stokely Carmichael is credited for coining the phrase institutional racism in the late 1960s  He defined the term as  the collective failure of an organization to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour  culture or ethnic origin   33  Maulana Karenga argued that racism constituted the destruction of culture  language  religion and human possibility  and that the effects of racism were  the morally monstrous destruction of human possibility involved redefining African humanity to the world  poisoning past  present and future relations with others who only know us through this stereotyping and thus damaging the truly human relations among peoples   34  Economic This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   November 2010  Historical economic or social disparity is alleged to be a form of discrimination caused by past racism and historical reasons  affecting the present generation through deficits in the formal education and kinds of preparation in previous generation  and through primarily unconscious racist attitudes and actions on members of the general population  A hypothesis embraced by classical economists is that competition in a capitalist economy decreases the impact of discrimination  The thinking behind the hypothesis is that discrimination imposes a cost on the employer  and thus a profit driven employer will avoid racist hiring policies  Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses  Germany  1933 Although a capitalist economy would avoid discrimination in order to avoid extra cost  this can be avoided in other ways  A capitalist company  for example  may use racist hiring policies as it deviates towards the  cultural norm   For example  in a predominantly white society  hiring a person of colour into a position of management may then cause disputes  and damage communications between other employers  Thus  the company would be economically put in a deficit because of the discrimination of other companies  as they invoke discrimination and isolate that company  Although this may be a radical  over exaggerated point of view  it portrays how pervasive racism is and how company who   will some time deviate towards racist hiring policies in order to henceforth be not isolated  thus preventing the company from going into an economic deficit   Burton 2009 1  For decades  African American farmers said they were unjustly being denied farm loans or subjected to longer waits for loan approval because of racism  35  and accused the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  of not responding to their complaints  36  In 2011  Bank of America agreed to pay  335 million to settle a federal government claim that its mortgage division  Countrywide Financial  discriminated against black and Hispanic homebuyers  21  In a 2011 news story  Investor s Business Daily wrote   Before the mortgage crisis  Attorney General Janet Reno accused banks of racism for failing to market mortgages to poor minorities with weak credit  Fear of prosecution set off a stampede of risky inner city lending that led  in part  to today s record home foreclosures  Now Reno s deputy   current Attorney General Eric Holder   is prosecuting banks for doing too well what he and Reno ordered them to do before the crisis   targeting of minority communities  for subprime and other high cost loans   37  During the Spanish colonial period  Spaniards developed a complex caste system based on race  which was used for social control and which also determined a person s importance in society  38  While many Latin American countries have long since rendered the system officially illegal through legislation  usually at the time of their independence  prejudice based on degrees of perceived racial distance from European ancestry combined with one s socioeconomic status remain  an echo of the colonial caste system  Almost uniformly  people who are darker skinned and of indigenous descent make up the peasantry and working classes  while lighter skinned  Spanish descent Latin Americans are in the ruling elite  39  40  Declarations and international law against racial discrimination In 1919  a proposal to include a racial equality provision in the Covenant of the League of Nations was supported by a majority  but not adopted in the Paris Peace Conference  1919  In 1943  Japan and its allies declared work for the abolition of racial discrimination to be their aim at the Greater East Asia Conference  41  Article 1 of the 1945 UN Charter includes  promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race  as UN purpose  An anti discrimination poster in a Hong Kong subway station  2005 In 1950  UNESCO suggested in The Race Question  a statement signed by 21 scholars such as Ashley Montagu  Claude L vi Strauss  Gunnar Myrdal  Julian Huxley  etc    to  drop the term race altogether and instead speak of ethnic groups   The statement condemned scientific racism theories that had played a role in the Holocaust  It aimed both at debunking scientific racist theories  by popularizing modern knowledge concerning  the race question   and morally condemned racism as contrary to the philosophy of the Enlightenment and its assumption of equal rights for all  Along with Myrdal s An American Dilemma  The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy  1944   The Race Question influenced the 1954 U S  Supreme Court desegregation decision in  Brown v  Board of Education of Topeka   42  Also in 1950  the European Convention on Human Rights was adopted  widely used on racial discrimination issues  43  The United Nations use the definition of racial discrimination laid out in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination  adopted in 1966    any distinction  exclusion  restriction or preference based on race  color  descent  or national or ethnic origin that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition  enjoyment or exercise  on an equal footing  of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political  economic  social  cultural or any other field of public life  Part 1 of Article 1 of the U N  International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination  44  In 2001  the European Union explicitly banned racism  along with many other forms of social discrimination  in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union  the legal effect of which  if any  would necessarily be limited to Institutions of the European Union   Article 21 of the charter prohibits discrimination on any ground such as race  color  ethnic or social origin  genetic features  language  religion or belief  political or any other opinion  membership of a national minority  property  disability  age or sexual orientation and also discrimination on the grounds of nationality   45  Ideology A racist political campaign poster from the 1866 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election A sign on a racially segregated beach in South Africa during the South Africa under apartheid As an ideology  racism existed during the 19th century as  scientific racism   which attempted to provide a racial classification of humanity  46  Although such racist ideologies have been widely discredited after World War II and the Holocaust  racism and racial discrimination have remained widespread around the world  Some examples of this in present day are statistics including  but not limited to  the racial breakdown of the prison population versus the national population  physical abilities and mental ability statistics  and other data gathered by scientific groups  While these statistics may be accurate  and can show trends  it s inappropriate in most countries to assume that because a particular race has a high crime or low literacy rate  that the entire race of people are inherent criminals  or inherently unintelligent  It was already noted by DuBois that  in making the difference between races  it is not race that we think about  but culture      a common history  common laws and religion  similar habits of thought and a conscious striving together for certain ideals of life   47  Late 19th century nationalists were the first to embrace contemporary discourses on  race   ethnicity and  survival of the fittest  to shape new nationalist doctrines  Ultimately  race came to represent not only the most important traits of the human body  but was also regarded as decisively shaping the character and personality of the nation  48  According to this view  culture is the physical manifestation created by ethnic groupings  as such fully determined by racial characteristics  Culture and race became considered intertwined and dependent upon each other  sometimes even to the extent of including nationality or language to the set of definition  Pureness of race tended to be related to rather superficial characteristics that were easily addressed and advertised  such as blondness  Racial qualities tended to be related to nationality and language rather than the actual geographic distribution of racial characteristics  In the case of Nordicism  the denomination  Germanic  became virtually equivalent to superiority of race  Bolstered by some nationalist and ethnocentric values and achievements of choice  this concept of racial superiority evolved to distinguish from other cultures  that were considered inferior or impure  This emphasis on culture corresponds to the modern mainstream definition of racism   Racism does not originate from the existence of  races   It creates them through a process of social division into categories  anybody can be racialised  independently of their somatic  cultural  religious differences   49  This definition explicitly ignores the biological concept of race  still subject to scientific debate  In the words of David C  Rowe  A racial concept  although sometimes in the guise of another name  will remain in use in biology and in other fields because scientists  as well as lay persons  are fascinated by human diversity  some of which is captured by race   50  Until recently  this racist abuse of physical anthropology has been politically exploited  Apart from being unscientific  racial prejudice became subject to international legislation  For instance  the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination  adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on November 20  1963  address racial prejudice explicitly next to discrimination for reasons of race  colour or ethnic origin  Article I   51  Racism has been a motivating factor in social discrimination  racial segregation  hate speech and violence  such as pogroms  genocides and ethnic cleansings   Despite the persistence of racial stereotypes  humor and epithets in much everyday language  racial discrimination is illegal in many countries  Ironically  anti racism has also become a political instrument of abuse  Some politicians have practised  3  in an attempt to win votes  In a reversal of values  anti racism is being propagated by despots in the service of obscurantism and the suppression of women  Philosopher Pascal Bruckner claimed that  Anti racism in the UN has become the ideology of totalitarian regimes who use it in their own interests   52  Ethnic nationalism Further information  Ethnic nationalism  and Romantic nationalism After the Napoleonic Wars  Europe was confronted with the new  nationalities question   leading to reconfigurations of the European map  on which the frontiers between the states had been delimited during the 1648 Peace of Westphalia  Nationalism had made its first appearance with the invention of the lev e en masse by the French revolutionaries  thus inventing mass conscription in order to be able to defend the newly founded Republic against the Ancien R gime order represented by the European monarchies  This led to the French Revolutionary Wars  1792 1802  and then to the Napoleonic conquests  and to the subsequent European wide debates on the concepts and realities of nations  and in particular of nation states  The Westphalia Treaty had divided Europe into various empires and kingdoms  Ottoman Empire  Holy Roman Empire  Swedish Empire  Kingdom of France  etc    and for centuries wars were waged between princes  Kabinettskriege in German   Modern nation states appeared in the wake of the French Revolution  with the formation of patriotic sentiments for the first time in Spain during the Peninsula War  1808 1813   known in Spain as the Independence War   Despite the restoration of the previous order with the 1815 Congress of Vienna  the  nationalities question  became the main problem of Europe during the Industrial Era  leading in particular to the 1848 Revolutions  the Italian unification completed during the 1871 Franco Prussian War  which itself culminated in the proclamation of the German Empire in the Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles  thus achieving the German unification  Meanwhile  the Ottoman Empire  the  sick man of Europe   was confronted with endless nationalist movements  which  along with the dissolving of the Austrian Hungarian Empire  would lead to the creation after World War I of the various nation states of the Balkans  with  national minorities  in their borders  53 Ethnic nationalism  which advocated the belief in a hereditary membership of the nation  made its appearance in the historical context surrounding the creation of the modern nation states  One of its main influences was the Romantic nationalist movement at the turn of the 19th century  represented by figures such as Johann Herder  1744 1803   Johan Fichte  1762 1814  in the Addresses to the German Nation  1808   Friedrich Hegel  1770 1831   or also  in France  Jules Michelet  1798 1874   It was opposed to liberal nationalism  represented by authors such as Ernest Renan  1823 1892   who conceived of the nation as a community  which  instead of being based on the Volk ethnic group and on a specific  common language  was founded on the subjective will to live together   the nation is a daily plebiscite   1882  or also John Stuart Mill  1806 1873   54  A caricature from the German antisemitic Der St rmer  around Christmas 1929  It urged Germans to avoid buying from Jewish shops  Ethnic nationalism blended with scientific racist discourses  as well as with  continental imperialist   Hannah Arendt  1951 55   discourses  for example in the pan Germanism discourses  which postulated the racial superiority of the German Volk  The Pan German League  Alldeutscher Verband   created in 1891  promoted German imperialism   racial hygiene  and was opposed to intermarriage with Jews  Another popular current  the V lkisch movement  was also an important proponent of the German ethnic nationalist discourse  which combined with modern antisemitism  Members of the V lkisch movement  in particular the Thule Society  would participate in the founding of the German Workers  Party  DAP  in Munich in 1918  the predecessor of the NSDAP Nazi party  Pan Germanism and played a decisive role in the interwar period of the 1920s 1930s  55  These currents began to associate the idea of the nation with the biological concept of a  master race   often the  Aryan race  or  Nordic race   issued from the scientific racist discourse  They conflated nationalities with ethnic groups  called  races   in a radical distinction from previous racial discourses that posited the existence of a  race struggle  inside the nation and the state itself  Furthermore  they believed that political boundaries should mirror these alleged racial and ethnic groups  thus justifying ethnic cleansing in order to achieve  racial purity  and also to achieve ethnic homogeneity in the nation state  Such racist discourses  combined with nationalism  were not  however  limited to pan Germanism  In France  the transition from Republican  liberal nationalism  to ethnic nationalism  which made nationalism a characteristic of far right movements in France  took place during the Dreyfus Affair at the end of the 19th century  During several years  a nation wide crisis affected French society  concerning the alleged treason of Alfred Dreyfus  a French Jewish military officer  The country polarized itself into two opposite camps  one represented by  mile Zola  who wrote J accuse in defense of Alfred Dreyfus  and the other represented by the nationalist poet  Maurice Barr s  1862 1923   one of the founders of the ethnic nationalist discourse in France  56  At the same time  Charles Maurras  1868 1952   founder of the monarchist Action fran aise movement  theorized the  anti France   composed of the  four confederate states of Protestants  Jews  Freemasons and foreigners   his actual word for the latter being the pejorative m t ques    Indeed  to him the first three were all  internal foreigners   who threatened the ethnic unity of the French people  Ethnic conflicts Further information  Ethnicity Debates over the origins of racism often suffer from a lack of clarity over the term  Many use the term  racism  to refer to more general phenomena  such as xenophobia and ethnocentrism  although scholars attempt to clearly distinguish those phenomena from racism as an ideology or from scientific racism  which has little to do with ordinary xenophobia  Others conflate recent forms of racism with earlier forms of ethnic and national conflict  In most cases  ethno national conflict seems to owe itself to conflict over land and strategic resources  In some cases  ethnicity and nationalism were harnessed to rally combatants in wars between great religious empires  for example  the Muslim Turks and the Catholic Austro Hungarians   Picture showing Armenians killed during the Armenian Genocide of 1915  Notions of race and racism often have played central roles in such ethnic conflicts  Throughout history  when an adversary is identified as  other  based on notions of race or ethnicity  in particular when  other  is construed to mean  inferior    the means employed by the self presumed  superior  party to appropriate territory  human chattel  or material wealth often have been more ruthless  more brutal  and less constrained by moral or ethical considerations  According to historian Daniel Richter  Pontiac s Rebellion saw the emergence on both sides of the conflict of  the novel idea that all Native people were  Indians   that all Euro Americans were  Whites   and that all on one side must unite to destroy the other    Richter  Facing East from Indian Country  p  208  Basil Davidson insists in his documentary  Africa  Different but Equal  that racism  in fact  only just recently surfaced as late as the 19th century  due to the need for a justification for slavery in the Americas  The idea of slavery as an  equal opportunity employer  was denounced with the introduction of Christian theory in the West  Maintaining that Africans were  subhuman  was the only loophole in the then accepted law that  men are created equal  that would allow for the sustenance of the Triangular Trade  New peoples in the Americas  possible slaves  were encountered  fought  and ultimately subdued  but  then  due to European diseases  their populations drastically decreased  Through both influences  theories about  race  developed  and these helped many to justify the differences in position and treatment of people whom they categorized as belonging to different races  see Eric Wolf s Europe and the People without History   Juan Gin s de Sep lveda argued that  during the Valladolid controversy in the middle of the 16th century  the Native Americans were natural slaves because they had no souls  In Asia  the Chinese and Japanese Empires were both strong colonial powers  with the Chinese making colonies and vassal states of much of East Asia throughout history  and the Japanese doing the same in the 19th 20th centuries  In both cases  the Asian imperial powers believed they were ethnically and racially preferenced too  Academic variants Drawings from Josiah C  Nott and George Gliddon s Indigenous races of the earth  1857   which

Stuttgart  Germany  in 1928  Scientific variants Main article  Scientific racism Further information  Unilineal evolution The modern biological definition of race developed in the 19th century with scientific racist theories  The term scientific racism refers to the use of science to justify and support racist beliefs  which goes back to the early 18th century  though it gained most of its influence in the mid 19th century  during the New Imperialism period  Also known as academic racism  such theories first needed to overcome the Church s resistance to positivist accounts of history and its support of monogenism  the concept that all human beings were originated from the same ancestors  in accordance with creationist accounts of history  These racist theories put forth on scientific hypothesis were combined with unilineal theories of social progress  which postulated the superiority of the European civilization over the rest of the world  Furthermore  they frequently made use of the idea of  survival of the fittest   a term coined by Herbert Spencer in 1864  associated with ideas of competition  which were named social Darwinism in the 1940s  Charles Darwin himself opposed the idea of rigid racial differences in The Descent of Man  1871  in which he argued that humans were all of one species  sharing common descent  He recognised racial differences as varieties of humanity  and emphasised the close similarities between people of all races in mental faculties  tastes  dispositions and habits  while still contrasting the culture of the  lowest savages  with European civilization  60  61  At the end of the 19th century  proponents of scientific racism intertwined themselves with eugenics discourses of  degeneration of the race  and  blood heredity   Henceforth  scientific racist discourses could be defined as the combination of polygenism  unilinealism  social Darwinism and eugenism  They found their scientific legitimacy on physical anthropology  anthropometry  craniometry  phrenology  physiognomy  and others now discredited disciplines in order to formulate racist prejudices  Before being disqualified in the 20th century by the American school of cultural anthropology  Franz Boas  etc    the British school of social anthropology  Bronis aw Malinowski  Alfred Radcliffe Brown  etc    the French school of ethnology  Claude L vi Strauss  etc    as well as the discovery of the neo Darwinian synthesis  such sciences  in particular anthropometry  were used to deduce behaviours and psychological characteristics from outward  physical appearances  The neo Darwinian synthesis  first developed in the 1930s  eventually led to a gene centered view of evolution in the 1960s  According to the Human Genome Project  the most complete mapping of human DNA to date indicates that there is no clear genetic basis to racial groups  While some genes are more common in certain populations  there are no genes that exist in all members of one population and no members of any other  62  Heredity and eugenics Further information  Eugenics The first theory of eugenics was developed in 1869 by Francis Galton  1822 1911   who used the then popular concept of degeneration  He applied statistics to study human differences and the alleged  inheritance of intelligence   foreshadowing future uses of  intelligence testing  by the anthropometry school  Such theories were vividly described by the writer  mile Zola  1840 1902   who started publishing in 1871 a twenty novel cycle  Les Rougon Macquart  where he linked heredity to behavior  Thus  Zola described the high born Rougons as those involved in politics  Son Excellence Eug ne Rougon  and medicine  Le Docteur Pascal  and the low born Macquarts as those fatally falling into alcoholism  L Assommoir   prostitution  Nana   and homicide  La B te humaine   During the rise of Nazism in Germany  some scientists in Western nations worked to debunk the regime s racial theories  A few argued against racist ideologies and discrimination  even if they believed in the alleged existence of biological races  However  in the fields of anthropology and biology  these were minority positions until the mid 20th century  63  According to the 1950 UNESCO statement  The Race Question  an international project to debunk racist theories had been attempted in the mid 1930s  However  this project had been abandoned  Thus  in 1950  UNESCO declared that it had resumed  up again  after a lapse of fifteen years  a project that the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation has wished to carry through but that it had to abandon in deference to the appeasement policy of the pre war period  The race question had become one of the pivots of Nazi ideology and policy  Masaryk and Bene  took the initiative of calling for a conference to re establish in the minds and consciences of men everywhere the truth about race    Nazi propaganda was able to continue its baleful work unopposed by the authority of an international organisation  The Third Reich s racial policies  its eugenics programs and the extermination of Jews in the Holocaust  as well as Romani people in the Porrajmos  the Romani Holocaust  and others minorities led to a change in opinions about scientific research into race after the war  Changes within scientific disciplines  such as the rise of the Boasian school of anthropology in the United States contributed to this shift  These theories were strongly denounced in the 1950 UNESCO statement  signed by internationally renowned scholars  and titled The Race Question  Polygenism and racial typologies Further information  Polygenism  and Typology  anthropology  Works such as Arthur de Gobineau s An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races  1853 1855  may be considered as one of the first theorizations of this new racism  founded on an essentialist notion of race  which opposed the former racial discourse  of Boulainvilliers for example  which saw in races a fundamentally historical reality  which changed over time  Gobineau  thus  attempted to frame racism within the terms of biological differences among humans  giving it the legitimacy of biology  He was one of the first theorists to postulate polygenism  stating that there were  at the origins of the world  various discrete  races   Gobineau s theories would be expanded  in France  by Georges Vacher de Lapouge  1854 1936  s typology of races  who published in 1899 The Aryan and his Social Role  in which he claimed that the white   Aryan race    dolichocephalic   was opposed to the  brachycephalic  race  of whom the  Jew  was the archetype  Vacher de Lapouge thus created a hierarchical classification of races  in which he identified the  Homo europaeus  Teutonic  Protestant  etc    the  Homo alpinus   Auvergnat  Turkish  etc    and finally the  Homo mediterraneus   Neapolitan  Andalus  etc   He assimilated races and social classes  considering that the French upper class was a representation of the Homo europaeus  while the lower class represented the Homo alpinus  Applying Galton s eugenics to his theory of races  Vacher de Lapouge s  selectionism  aimed first at achieving the annihilation of trade unionists  considered to be a  degenerate   second  creating types of man each destined to one end  in order to prevent any contestation of labour conditions  His  anthroposociology  thus aimed at blocking social conflict by establishing a fixed  hierarchical social order 64  The same year  William Z  Ripley used identical racial classification in The Races of Europe  1899   which would have a great influence in the United States  Other scientific authors include H S  Chamberlain at the end of the 19th century  a British citizen who naturalized himself as German because of his admiration for the  Aryan race   or Madison Grant  a eugenicist and author of The Passing of the Great Race  1916   Human zoos Human zoos  called  People Shows    were an important means of bolstering popular racism by connecting it to scientific racism  they were both objects of public curiosity and of anthropology and anthropometry  65  66 Joice Heth  an African American slave  was displayed by P T  Barnum in 1836  a few years after the exhibition of Saartjie Baartman  the  Hottentot Venus   in England  Such exhibitions became common in the New Imperialism period  and remained so until World War II  Carl Hagenbeck  inventor of the modern zoos  exhibited animals beside humans who were considered  savages   67  68  Congolese pygmy Ota Benga was displayed in 1906 by eugenicist Madison Grant  head of the Bronx Zoo  as an attempt to illustrate the  missing link  between humans and orangutans  thus  racism was tied to Darwinism  creating a social Darwinist ideology that tried to ground itself in Darwin s scientific discoveries  The 1931 Paris Colonial Exhibition displayed Kanaks from New Caledonia  69  A  Congolese village  was on display as late as 1958 at the Brussels  World Fair  Evolutionary theories about the origins of racism See also  Ethnocentrism Biologists John Tooby and Leda Cosmides were puzzled by the fact that race is one of the three characteristics most often used in brief descriptions of individuals  the others are age and sex   They reasoned that natural selection would not have favoured the evolution of an instinct for using race as a classification  because for most of human history  humans almost never encountered members of other races  Tooby and Cosmides hypothesized that modern people use race as a proxy  rough and ready indicator  for coalition membership  since a better than random guess about  which side  another person is on will be helpful if one does not actually know in advance  Their colleague Robert Kurzban designed an experiment whose results appeared to support this hypothesis  Using the Memory confusion protocol  they presented subjects with pictures of individuals and sentences  allegedly spoken by these individuals  which presented two sides of a debate  The errors that the subjects made in recalling who said what indicated that they sometimes misattributed a statement to a speaker of the same race as the  correct  speaker  although they also sometimes misattributed a statement to a speaker  on the same side  as the  correct  speaker  In a second run of the experiment  the team also distinguished the  sides  in the debate by clothing of similar colors  and in this case the effect of racial similarity in causing mistakes almost vanished  being replaced by the color of their clothing  In other words  the first group of subjects  with no clues from clothing  used race as a visual guide to guessing who was on which side of the debate  the second group of subjects used the clothing color as their main visual clue  and the effect of race became very small   70  Some research suggests that ethnocentric thinking may have actually contributed to the development of cooperation  Political scientists Ross Hammond and Robert Axelrod created a computer simulation wherein virtual individuals were randomly assigned one of a variety of skin colors  and then one of a variety of trading strategies  be color blind  favor those of your own color  or favor those of other colors  They found that the ethnocentric individuals clustered together  then grew until all the non ethnocentric individuals were wiped out  71  In The Selfish Gene  evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins writes that  Blood feuds and inter clan warfare are easily interpretable in terms of Hamilton s genetic theory   Dawkins writes that racial prejudice  while not evolutionarily adaptive   could be interpreted as an irrational generalization of a kin selected tendency to identify with individuals physically resembling oneself  and to be nasty to individuals different in appearance   72  Simulation based experiments in evolutionary game theory have attempted to provide an explanation for the selection of ethnocentric strategy phenotypes  73  As state sponsored activity Main articles  Nazism and race  Racial policy of Nazi Germany  Racism in

1994  Here a series of Apartheid legislation in South Africa was passed through the legal systems to make it legal for white South Africans to have rights which were superior to those of non white South Africans  Non white South Africans were not allowed involvement in any governing matters  including voting  access to quality healthcare  the provision of basic services  including clean water  electricity  as well as access to adequate schooling  Non white South Africans were also prevented from accessing certain public areas  using certain public transportation and were required to live only in certain designated areas  Non white South Africans were taxed differently from white South Africans and were required to carry on them at all times additional documentation  which later became known as  dom passes   to certify their non white South African citizenship  All of these legislative racial laws were abolished through a series of equal human rights laws passed at the end of Apartheid in the early 1990s  State racism contributed as well to the formation of the Dominican Republic s identity  78  and violent actions encouraged by Dominican governmental xenophobia against Haitians and  Haitian looking  people  Currently the Dominican Republic employs a de facto system of separatism for children and grandchildren of Haitians and black Dominicans  denying them birth

dispute is resolved   October 2010  In Antiquity Edith Sanders cited the Babylonian Talmud  which divides mankind between the three sons of Noah  stating that  the descendants of Ham are cursed by being black  and  it  depicts Ham as a sinful man and his progeny as degenerates   80 Bernard Lewis has cited the Greek philosopher Aristotle who  in his discussion of slavery  stated that while Greeks are free by nature   barbarians   non Greeks  are slaves by nature  in that it is in their nature to be more willing to submit to despotic government  81  Though Aristotle does not specify any particular races  he argues that people from outside Greece are more prone to the burden of slavery than those from Ancient Greece  82  Middle Ages and Renaissance Further information  Limpieza de sangre In the Middle East and North Africa region  racist opinions were expressed within the works of some of its historians and geographers 83  including Al Muqaddasi  Al Jahiz  Al Masudi  Abu Rayhan Biruni  Nasir al Din al Tusi  and Ibn Qutaybah  83  In the 14th century CE  the Tunisian scholar Ibn Khaldun wrote      beyond  known peoples of black West Africa  to the south there is no civilization in the proper sense  There are only humans who are closer to dumb animals than to rational beings  They live in thickets and caves  and eat herbs and unprepared grain  They frequently eat each other  They cannot be considered human beings    Therefore  the Negro nations are  as a rule  submissive to slavery  because  Negroes  have little that is  essentially  human and possess attributes that are quite similar to those of dumb animals  as we have stated   83  84  Though the Qur an expresses no racial prejudice  such prejudices later developed among Arabs for a variety of reasons 81   their extensive conquests and slave trade  the influence of Aristotelian ideas regarding slavery  which some Muslim philosophers directed towards Zanj  East African  and Turkic peoples  81  and the influence of Judeo Christian ideas regarding divisions among humankind  85  In response to such views  the Afro Arab author Al Jahiz  himself having a Zanj grandfather  wrote a book entitled Superiority Of The Blacks To The Whites  86  and explained why the Zanj were black in terms of environmental determinism in the  On the Zanj  chapter of The Essays  87  By the 14th century  a significant number of slaves came from sub Saharan Africa  leading to the likes of Egyptian historian Al Abshibi  1388 1446  writing   It is said that when the  black  slave is sated  he fornicates  when he is hungry  he steals   88  According to J  Philippe Rushton  Arab relations with blacks whom the Muslims had dealt as slave traders for over 1 000 years could be summed up as follows  13th century slave market in Yemen  Yemen officially abolished slavery in 1962  89  It should be noted that ethnic prejudice among some elite Arabs was not limited to darker skinned black people  but was also directed towards fairer skinned  ruddy people   including Persians  Turks  Caucasians and Europeans   while Arabs referred to themselves as  swarthy people   90  However  the Umayyad Caliphate invaded Hispania and founded the advanced civilization of Al Andalus  where an era of religious tolerance and a Golden age of Jewish culture lasted for six centuries  91  It was followed by a violent Reconquista under the Catholic monarchs Ferdinand V and Isabella I  The Catholic Spaniards then formulated the Cleanliness of blood doctrine  It was during this time in history that the Western concept of aristocratic  blue blood  emerged in a highly racialized and implicitly white supremacist context  as author Robert Lacey explains  It was the Spaniards who gave the world the notion that an aristocrat s blood is not red but blue  The Spanish nobility started taking shape around the ninth century in classic military fashion  occupying land as warriors on horseback  They were to continue the process for more than five hundred years  clawing back sections of the peninsula from its Moorish occupiers  and a nobleman demonstrated his pedigree by holding up his sword arm to display the filigree of blue blooded veins beneath his pale skin proof that his birth had not been contaminated by the dark skinned enemy  Sangre azul  blue blood  was thus a euphemism for being a white man Spain s own particular reminder that the refined footsteps of the aristocracy through history carry the rather less refined spoor of racism  92  Following the expulsion of most Sephardic Jews from the Iberian peninsula  the remaining Jews and Muslims were forced to convert to Roman Catholicism  becoming  New Christians  which were despised and discriminated by the  Old Christians   An Inquisition was carried out by members of the Dominican Order in order to weed out converts that still practiced Judaism and Islam in secret  The system and ideology of the limpieza de sangre ostracized Christian converts from society  regardless of their actual degree of sincerity in their faith  In Portugal  the legal distinction between New and Old Christian was only ended through a legal decree issued by the Marquis of Pombal in 1772  almost three centuries after the implementation of the racist discrimination  The limpieza de sangre doctrine was also very common in the colonization of the Americas  where it led to the racial separation of the various peoples in the colonies and created a very intricate list of nomenclature to describe one s precise race and  by consequence  one s place in society  This precise classification was described by Eduardo Galeano in the Open Veins of Latin America  1971   It included  among others terms  mestizo  50  Spaniard and 50  Native American   castizo  75  European and 25  Native American   Spaniard  87 5  European and 12 5  Native American   Mulatto  50  European and 50  African   Albarazado  43 75  Native American  29 6875  European  and 26 5625  African   etc  The flag of Sardinia  popularly known also as the Four Moors flag  with a maure  moor s cut head  in each quarter  At the end of the Renaissance  the Valladolid debate  1550 1551  concerning the treatment of natives of the  New World  opposed the Dominican friar and Bishop of Chiapas Bartolom  de Las Casas to another Dominican philosopher Juan Gin s de Sep lveda  The latter argued that  Indians  were natural slaves because they had no souls  and were therefore beneath humanity  Thus  reducing them to slavery or serfdom was in accordance with Catholic theology and natural law  To the contrary  Bartolom  de Las Casas argued that the Amerindians were free men in the natural order and deserved the same treatment as others  according to Catholic theology  It was one of the many controversies concerning racism  slavery and Eurocentrism that would arise in the following centuries  Although anti Semitism has a long European history  related to Christianism  anti Judaism   racism itself is frequently described as a modern phenomenon  In the view of the French philosopher and historian Michel Foucault  the first formulation of racism emerged in the Early Modern period as the  discourse of race struggle   a historical and political discourse  which Foucault opposed to the philosophical and juridical discourse of sovereignty  93  Foucault thus argued that the first appearance of racism as a social discourse  as opposed to simple xenophobia  which some might argue has existed in all places and times  may be found during the 1688 Glorious Revolution in Great Britain  in Edward Coke or John Lilburne s work  However  this  discourse of race struggle   as interpreted by Foucault  must be distinguished from the 19th century biological racism  also known as  race science  or  scientific racism   Indeed  this early modern discourse has many points of difference with modern racism  First of all  in this  discourse of race struggle    race  is not considered a biological notion   which would divide humanity into distinct biological groups   but as a historical notion  Moreover  this discourse is opposed to the sovereign s discourse  it is used by the bourgeoisie  the people and the aristocracy as a mean of struggle against the monarchy  This discourse  which first appeared in Great Britain  was then carried on in France by people such as Boulainvilliers  Nicolas Fr ret  and then  during the 1789 French Revolution  Siey s  and afterward Augustin Thierry and Cournot  Boulainvilliers  which created the matrix of such racist discourse in medieval France  conceived the  race  as something closer to the sense of  nation   that is  in his times  the  people   He conceived France as divided between various nations   the unified nation state is  of course  here an anachronism   which themselves formed different  races   Boulainvilliers opposed the absolute monarchy  who tried to bypass the aristocracy by establishing a direct relationship to the Third Estate  Thus  he created this theory of the French aristocrats as being the descendants of foreign invaders  whom he called the  Franks   while the Third Estate constituted according to him the autochthonous  vanquished Gallo Romans  who were dominated by the Frankish aristocracy as a consequence of the right of conquest  Early modern racism was opposed to nationalism and the nation state  the Comte de Montlosier  in exile during the French Revolution  who borrowed Boulainvilliers  discourse on the  Nordic race  as being the French aristocracy that invaded the plebeian  Gauls   thus showed his despise for the Third Estate calling it  this new people born of slaves    mixture of all races and of all times   While 19th century racism became closely intertwined with nationalism  leading to the ethnic nationalist discourse that identified the  race  to the  folk   leading to such movements as pan Germanism  Zionism  pan Turkism  pan Arabism  and pan Slavism  medieval racism precisely divided the nation into various non biological  races   which were thought as the consequences of historical conquests and social conflicts  Michel Foucault traced the genealogy of modern racism to this medieval  historical and political discourse of race struggle   According to him  it divided itself in the 19th century according to two rival lines  on one hand  it was incorporated by racists  biologists and eugenicists  who gave it the modern sense of  race  and  even more  transformed this popular discourse into a  state racism   e g  Nazism   On the other hand  Marxists also seized this discourse founded on the assumption of a political struggle that provided the real engine of history and continued to act underneath the apparent peace  Thus  Marxists transformed the essentialist notion of  race  into the historical notion of  class struggle   defined by socially structured position  capitalist or proletarian  In The Will to Knowledge  1976   Foucault analyzed another opponent of the  race struggle  discourse  Sigmund Freud s psychoanalysis  which opposed the concepts of  blood heredity   prevalent in the 19th century racist discourse  19th century Authors such as Hannah Arendt  in her 1951 book The Origins of Totalitarianism  have said that the racist ideology  popular racism  that developed at the end of the 19th century helped legitimize the imperialist conquests of foreign territories and the acts that accompanied them  such as the Herero and Namaqua Genocide of 1904 1907 or the Armenian Genocide of 1915 1917   Rudyard Kipling s poem The White Man s Burden  1899  is one of the more famous illustrations of the belief in the inherent superiority of the European culture over the rest of the world  though also it is also thought to be a satirical appraisal of such imperialism  Racist ideology thus helped legitimize subjugation and the dismantling of the traditional societies of indigenous peoples  which were regarded as humanitarian obligations as a result of these racist beliefs  An illustration from Harper s Weekly shows an alleged similarity between  Irish Iberian  and  Negro  features in contrast to the higher  Anglo Teutonic   However  during the 19th century  West European colonial powers were involved in the suppression of the Arab slave trade in Africa  94  as well as in suppression of the slave trade in West Africa  95  Other colonialists recognized the depravity of their actions but persisted for personal gain  some Europeans during the time period objected to the injustices caused by colonialism and lobbied on behalf of aboriginal peoples  Thus  when the Hottentot Venus was displayed in England in the beginning of the 19th century  the African Association publicly opposed itself to the exhibition  The same year that Kipling published his poem  Joseph Conrad published Heart of Darkness  1899   a clear criticism of the Congo Free State owned by Leopold II of Belgium  Examples of racial theories used include the creation of the Hamitic ethno linguistic group during the European exploration of Africa  It was then restricted by Karl Friedrich Lepsius  1810 1877  to non Semitic Afro Asiatic languages  96  The term Hamite was applied to different populations within Africa  mainly comprising Ethiopians  Eritreans  Somalis  Berbers  and Nubians  Hamites were regarded as Caucasoid peoples who probably originated in either Arabia or Asia on the basis of their cultural  physical and linguistic similarities with the peoples of those areas  97  98  99  Europeans considered Hamites to be more civilized than Black Africans  and more akin to themselves and Semitic peoples  100  In the first two thirds of the 20th century  the Hamitic race was  in fact  considered one of the branches of the Caucasian race  along with the Indo Europeans  Dravidians  Semites  and the Mediterranean race  However  the Hamitic peoples themselves were often deemed to have failed as rulers  which was usually ascribed to interbreeding with Negroes  In the mid 20th century  the German scholar Carl Meinhof  1857 1944  claimed that the Bantu race was formed by a merger of Hamitic and Negro races  The Hottentots  Nama or Khoi  were formed by the merger of Hamitic and Bushmen  San  races   both being termed nowadays as Khoisan peoples   One in a series of posters attacking Radical Republicans on the issue of black suffrage  issued during the Pennsylvania gubernatorial election of 1866  In the United States in the early 19th century  the American Colonization Society was established as the primary vehicle for proposals to return black Americans to greater freedom and equality in Africa  101  The colonization effort resulted from a mixture of motives with its founder Henry Clay stating   unconquerable prejudice resulting from their color  they never could amalgamate with the free whites of this country  It was desirable  therefore  as it respected them  and the residue of the population of the country  to drain them off   102  Racism spread throughout the New World in the late 19th century and early 20th century  Whitecapping  which started in Indiana in the late 19th century  soon spread throughout all of North America  causing many African laborers to flee from the land they worked on  In the US during the 1860s  racist posters were used during election campaigns  In one of these racist posters  see above   a black man is depicted lounging idly in the foreground as one white man ploughs his field and another chops wood  Accompanying labels are   In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread   and  The white man must work to keep his children and pay his taxes   The black man wonders   Whar is

 Idleness   and so on  On June 5  1873  Sir Francis Galton  distinguished English explorer and cousin of Charles Darwin  wrote in a letter to The Times   My proposal is to make the encouragement of Chinese settlements of Africa a part of our national policy  in the belief that the Chinese immigrants would not only maintain their position  but that they would multiply and their descendants supplant the inferior Negro race   I should expect that the African seaboard  now sparsely occupied by lazy  palavering savages  might in a few years be tenanted by industrious  order loving Chinese  living either as a semidetached dependency of China  or else in perfect freedom under their own law    103  20th century Further information  Holocaust  Racial segregation in the United States  and

extermination of the Jewish race   109  Serious race riots in Durban between Indians and Zulus erupted in 1949  110 Ne Win s rise to power in Burma in 1962 and his relentless persecution of  resident aliens  led to an exodus of some 300 000 Burmese Indians  111  They migrated to escape racial discrimination and wholesale nationalisation of private enterprise a few years later in 1964  112  The Zanzibar Revolution of January 12  1964 put an end to the local Arab dynasty  113  Thousands of Arabs and Indians in Zanzibar were massacred in riots  and thousands more were detained or fled the island  114  On 4 August 1972  Idi Amin  President of Uganda  ethnically cleansed Uganda s Asians giving them 90 days to leave the country  115  Shortly after world war II the South African National Party took control over the governance in South Africa  Between 1948 and 1994  the Apartheid regime took place  This regime based their ideologies on the racial separation of whites and non  whites including the unequal rights of non whites  Several protests and violence occurred during the Apartheid in South Africa  the most famous of these include the Sharpeville Massacre in 1960  the Soweto uprising in 1976  the Church Street bombing of 1983 and the Cape Town peace march of 1989 Contemporary During the Congo Civil War  1998 2003   Pygmies were hunted down like game animals and eaten

reported that Lou Jing  of mixed Chinese and African parentage  had emerged as the most famous talent show contestant in China and has become the subject of intense debate because of her skin colour  125  Her attention in the media opened serious debates about racism in China and racial prejudice  126  In Asia and Latin America  light skin is seen as more attractive  127  Thus  skin whitening cosmetic products are popular in East Asia 128  and India  129  Some activists  most prominently at the UN conference at Durban  have asserted that the caste system in India is a form of racial discrimination  130  131  Genetic studies have corroborated this view  132  Currently  there are approximately 165 million Dalits  formerly known as  untouchables   in India  133  Some 70 000 black African Mauritanians were expelled from Mauritania in the late 1980s  134  In the Sudan  black African captives in the civil war were often enslaved  and female prisoners were often used sexually  135  The Darfur conflict has been described by some as a racial matter  136  In October 2006  Niger announced that it would deport the Arabs living in the Diffa region of eastern Niger to Chad  137  This population numbered about 150 000  138  While the Government collected Arabs in preparation for the deportation  two girls died  reportedly after fleeing Government forces  and three women suffered

150  The Fiji coup of 2000 has provoked a violent backlash against the Indo Fijians  151  Fiji citizens of Indian  European  mixed race or other island heritage have become second class citizens  152  153  Racial divisions also exist in Guyana  154 Malaysia  155 Trinidad and Tobago  156  or Madagascar  157  One particularly pernicious form of racism in the United States is racial segregation  which  it can be argued  continues to exist today  158  dubious   discuss  Inter minority variants Prejudiced thinking among and between minority groups does occur  for example conflicts between African Americans and Korean Americans  notably in the Los Angeles riots of 1992   by blacks towards Jews  such as the riots in Crown Heights in 1991   between new immigrant groups  such as Latinos   or towards whites  159  160  161  162  There has been a long running racial tension between African Americans and Mexican Americans  163  164  165  There have been several significant riots in California prisons in which Mexican American inmates and African Americans have specifically targeted each other based on racial reasons  166  167  There have been reports of racially motivated attacks against African Americans who have moved into neighborhoods occupied mostly by Mexican Americans  and vice versa  168  169  170  171  In the late 1920s in California  there was animosity between the Filipinos and the Mexicans and between European Americans and Filipino Americans since they competed for the same jobs  172  Recently  there has also been an increase in racial violence between African immigrants and Blacks who have already lived in the country for generations  173  The Aztlan movement has been described as racist  The movement s goal is repossession of the American southwest  It has also been called the Mexican  reconquista   re conquest  whose name was inspired by the Spanish reconquista  which led to the expulsion of the Moors from Spain  174  According to gang experts and law enforcement agents  a longstanding race war between the Mexican Mafia and the Black Guerilla family  a rival African American prison gang  has generated such intense racial hatred among Mexican Mafia leaders or shot callers  that they have issued a  green light  on all blacks  A sort of gang life fatwa  this amounts to a standing authorization for Latino gang members to prove their mettle by terrorizing or even murdering any blacks sighted in a neighborhood claimed by a gang loyal to the Mexican Mafia  175  In Britain  tensions between minority groups can be just as strong as those between minorities and the majority population  In Birmingham  there have been long term divisions between the Black and South Asian communities  which were illustrated in the Handsworth riots and in

racist language has been increasing over the last several years  Jewish leaders perceive the Muslim population as intensifying anti Semitism in France  mainly among Muslims of Arab or African heritage  but also this anti Semitism is perceived as also growing among Caribbean islanders from former colonies  178  179  Research on influencing factors Research has examined factors influencing tolerance  in particular ethnic tolerance  prejudice  and trust  Authoritarian personality has been associated with prejudice and intolerance  Education has an inverse association which is stronger in established democracies than in emerging  Different groups are viewed differently and including illegal groups in tolerance surveys may reduce tolerance levels in all counties except the United States  Increased contact with other groups increase tolerance  Increased perception of threat  including from the home land of an ethnic minority  reduces tolerance  Competition over jobs reduces tolerance and occupational segregation reduced ethnic conflicts and ethnic prejudice in studies in the United States and Yugoslavia  Tolerance is increased by democratic stability and a federal system  Increased ethnic heterogeneity increases tolerance up to a point but beyond this tolerance decreases  The negative effect of increased ethnic heterogeneity is stronger when looking at larger areas such as nations compared to smaller areas such as neighborhoods  This may be due to the contact effect being relatively more important at local levels while the threat effect becomes more important in larger areas  180  Anti Racism Main article  Anti racism Anti racism include beliefs  actions  movements  and policies adopted or developed to oppose racism  In general  it promotes an egalitarian society in which people are not discriminated against in race  Movements such as the African American Civil Rights Movement and the Anti Apartheid movement were examples of anti racist movements  Nonviolent resistance is sometimes an element of anti racial movements  although this was not always the case  Hate crime laws and affirmative action are also examples of government policy designed to suppress racism  International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination UNESCO marks March 21 as the yearly International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination  in memory of the
