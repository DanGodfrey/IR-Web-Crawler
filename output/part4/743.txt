started as an express mail business in Albany  New York  in 1850  10  It was founded as a joint stock corporation by the merger of the express companies owned by Henry Wells  Wells  amp  Company   William Fargo  Livingston  Fargo  amp  Company   and John Warren Butterfield  Wells  Butterfield  amp  Company  the successor earlier in 1850 of Butterfield  Wasson  amp  Company   1  2  The same founders also started Wells Fargo  amp  Co  in 1852 when Butterfield and other directors objected to the proposal that American Express extend its operations to California  American Express first established its headquarters in a building at the intersection of Jay Street and Hudson Street in what was later called the TriBeCa section of Manhattan  For years it enjoyed a virtual monopoly on the movement of express shipments  goods  securities  currency  etc   throughout New York State  In 1874  American Express moved its headquarters to 65 Broadway in what was becoming the Financial District of Manhattan  a location it was to retain through two buildings  11   edit  American Express buildings In 1854  the American Express Co  purchased a lot on Vesey Street in New York City as the site for its stables  The company s first New York headquarters were in an impressive citation needed  marble Italianate palazzo at 55 61 Hudson Street between Thomas Street and Jay Street  1857 58  John Warren Ritch   which had a busy freight depot on the ground story with a spur line from the Hudson River Railroad  A stable was constructed nearby at 4 8 Hubert Street  between Hudson Street and Collister Street  1866 67  Ritch  amp  Griffiths   five blocks north of the Hudson Street building  The company prospered sufficiently that headquarters were moved in 1874 from the wholesale shipping district to the budding Financial District  and into rented offices in two five story brownstone commercial buildings at 63 and 65 Broadway  between Exchange Alley and Rector Street  and between Broadway and Trinity Place that were owned by the Harmony family  12  In 1880  American Express built a new warehouse behind the Broadway Building at 46 Trinity Place  between Exchange Alley and Rector Street  The designer is unknown  but it has a fa ade of brick arches that are redolent of pre skyscraper New York  American Express has long been out of this building  but it still bears a terracotta seal with the American Express Eagle  13  In 1890 91 the company constructed a new ten story building by Edward H  Kendall on the site of its former headquarters on Hudson Street  By 1903  the company had assets of some  28 million  second only to the National City Bank of New York among financial institutions in the city  citation needed  To reflect this  the company purchased the Broadway buildings and site  citation needed  At the end of the Wells Fargo reign in 1914  an aggressive new president  George Chadbourne Taylor  1868 1923   who had worked his way up through the company over the previous thirty years  decided to build a new headquarters  The old buildings  dubbed by the New York Times as  among the ancient landmarks  of lower Broadway  were inadequate for such a rapidly expanding concern  In March 1914  Renwick  Aspinwall  amp  Tucker filed for the construction of a 32 story concrete and steel framed office tower in which all of the company s operations  then in four separate buildings  were to be consolidated  The building proposal of 1914 was abandoned  probably due to the war in Europe  but was resurrected two years later in a reduced form  at an estimated cost of  1 million  12  65 Broadway The 21 story  plus basement   neo classical  American Express Co  Building  was constructed in 1916 17 to the design of James L  Aspinwall  of the firm of Renwick  Aspinwall  amp  Tucker  the successor to the architectural practice of the eminent James Renwick  Jr   The building consolidated the two lots of the former buildings with a single address  65 Broadway  This building was part of the  Express Row  section of lower Broadway at the time  The concrete and steel framed building has an H shaped plan with tall slender wings arranged around central light courts  a type of plan employed from the 1880s through the 1910s to provide offices with maximum light and air  Faced in white brick and terra cotta above a granite base  both facades employ the tripartite composition of base shaft capital then popular for the articulation of skyscrapers  with a colonnaded base and upper portion  The famous American Express Eagle adorns the building twice  there is an asymmetric eagle on the lower arch  while a symmetric eagle adorns the arch atop the building  The Broadway entrance features a double story Corinthian colonnade with large arched windows  The building completed the continuous masonry wall of its block front poda nae and assisted in transforming Broadway into the  canyon  of neo classical masonry office towers familiar to this day 14  American Express sold this building in 1975  but retained travel services here  The building was also the headquarters over the years of other prominent firms  including investment bankers J  amp  W  Seligman  amp  Co   1940 74   the American Bureau of Shipping  a maritime concern  1977 86   and currently J J  Kenny  and Standard  amp  Poor s  who has renamed the building for itself  12  14   edit  Nationwide expansion American Express extended its reach nationwide by arranging affiliations with other express companies  including Wells Fargo   the replacement for the two former companies that merged to form American Express   railroads  and steamship companies  11   edit  Financial services In 1882  American Express started its expansion in the area of financial services by launching a money order business 11  to compete with the United States Post Office s money orders  Sometime between 1888 and 1890  J  C  Fargo took a trip to Europe and returned frustrated and infuriated  Despite the fact that he was president of American Express and that he carried with him traditional letters of credit  he found it difficult to obtain cash anywhere except in major cities  Fargo went to Marcellus Flemming Berry and asked him to create a better solution than the traditional letter of credit  Berry introduced the American Express Traveler s Cheque which was launched in 1891 in denominations of  10   20   50  and  100  15  Traveler s cheques established American Express as a truly international company  In 1914  at the outbreak of World War I  American Express offices in Europe were among the few companies to honor the letters of credit  issued by various banks  held by Americans in Europe  despite other financial institutions having refused to assist these stranded travelers   edit  Loss of railroad express business American Express became one of the monopolies that President Theodore Roosevelt had the Interstate Commerce Commission investigate during his administration  The interest of the ICC was drawn to its strict control of the railroad express business  However  the solution did not come immediately to hand  11  The solution to this problem came as a coincidence to other problems during World War I  During the winter of 1917  the US suffered a severe coal shortage and on December 26 President Woodrow Wilson commandeered the railroads on behalf of the US government to move US troops  their supplies  and coal  Treasury Secretary William Gibbs McAdoo was assigned the task of consolidating the railway lines for the war effort  All contracts between express companies and railroads were nullified and McAdoo proposed that all existing express companies be consolidated into a single company to serve the country s needs  This ended American Express s express business  and removed them from the ICC s interest  The result was that a new company called the American Railway Express Agency formed in July 1918  The new entity took custody of all the pooled equipment and property of existing express companies  the largest share of which  40   came from American Express  who had owned the rights to the express business over 71 280 miles  114 710 km  of railroad lines  and had 10 000 offices  with over 30 000 employees    edit  Investment banking During the 1980s  American Express embarked on an effort to become a financial services supercompany and made a number of acquisitions to create an investment banking arm  In mid 1981 it purchased Sanford I  Weill s Shearson Loeb Rhoades  the second largest securities firm in the United States to form Shearson American Express  Shearson Lehman logo After the purchase of Shearson  Weill was given the position of president of American Express in 1983  Weill grew increasingly unhappy with responsibilities within American Express and his conflicts with American Express  CEO James D  Robinson III  Weill soon realized that he was not positioned to be named CEO and left in August 1985  In 1984  American Express acquired the investment banking and trading firm  Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb  and added it to the Shearson family  creating Shearson Lehman American Express  It was Lehman s CEO and former trader Lewis Glucksman who would next lead Shearson Lehman American Express  In 1984 Shearson American Express purchased the 90 year old Investors Diversified Services  bringing with it a fleet of financial advisors and investment products  In 1988  Shearson Lehman acquired E F  Hutton  amp  Co   a brokerage firm founded in 1904  this was merged with the investment banking business and the investment banking arm was renamed Shearson Lehman Hutton  Inc  16  However  when Harvey Golub became CEO of American Express in 1993  American express decided to get out of the investment banking business and negotiated the sale of Shearson s retail brokerage and asset management business to Primerica  The Shearson business was merged with Primerica s Smith Barney to create Smith Barney Shearson  Ultimately  the Shearson name was dropped in 1994  17  In 1994  American Express spun off of the remaining investment banking and institutional businesses as Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc which after almost fifteen years of independence would file for bankruptcy protection in 2008 as part of the Late 2000s financial crisis   edit  Recent history Current CEO Ken I  Chenault took over leadership of American Express in 2001 from Harvey Golub  CEO from 1993 to 2001  Prior to that  the company was headed by James D  Robinson III from 1977 to 1993   edit  Charge card services American Express Tower  tallest  left  in New York City American Express executives discussed the possibility of launching a travel charge card as early as 1946  but it was not until Diners Club launched their card in March 1950 that American Express began to seriously consider the possibility  At the end of 1957  American Express CEO Ralph Reed decided to get into the card business  and by the launch date of October 1  1958 public interest had become so significant that they issued 250 000 cards prior to the official launch date  The card was launched with an annual fee of  6   1 higher than Diners Club  to be seen as a premium product  The first cards were paper  with the account number and cardmember s name typed  It was not until 1959 that American Express began issuing embossed ISO IEC 7810 plastic cards  an industry first  In 1966  American Express introduced the Gold Card and in 1984 the Platinum Card  clearly defining different market segments within its own business  a practice that has proliferated across a broad array of industries  The Platinum Card was billed as super exclusive and had a  250 annual fee  it is currently  450   It was offered by invitation only to American Express customers with at least 2 years of tenure  significant spending  and excellent payment history  it is now open to applications on request  In 1987  American Express introduced the Optima card  their first credit card product  Previously  all American Express cards had to be paid in full each month  but Optima allowed customers to carry a balance  the charge cards also now allow extended payment options on qualifying charges based on credit availability   Although American Express no longer accepts applications for the Optima brand of cards  since July 13  2009  Optima cards are still listed on the American Express website  as a reference to existing members only  According to American Express  Optima accounts were not converted or closed  However  Blue from American Express has prevailed as the replacement for the original Optima style of credit card  Blue includes multiple benefits free of charge  unlike Optima  including the Membership Rewards program  In April 1992  American Express spun off its subsidiary  First Data Corp   in an IPO  Then  in October 1996  the company distributed the remaining majority of its holdings in First Data Corp   reducing its ownership to less than 5   In 1994  the Optima True Grace card was introduced  The card was unique in that it offered a grace period on all purchases whether a balance was carried on the card or not  as opposed to traditional revolving credit cards which charge interest on new purchases if so much as  1 was carried over   The card was discontinued a few years later  the now discontinued One from American Express card offered a similar feature called  Interest Protection    edit   Boston Fee Party  From early 1980s until the early 1990s  American Express was known for cutting its merchant fees  also known as a  discount rate   to merchants and restaurants if they accepted only American Express and no other credit or charge cards  This prompted competitors such as Visa and MasterCard to cry foul for a while as the tactics  locked  restaurants into American Express  However  in 1991  several restaurants in Boston started accepting and encouraging the use of Visa and MasterCard because of their far lower fees as compared to American Express  fees at the time  which were about 4  for each transaction versus around 1 2  at the time for Visa and MasterCard   A few even stopped accepting American Express credit and charge cards  The revolt  known as the  Boston Fee Party  in reference to the Boston Tea Party  quickly spread nationwide to over 250 restaurants across the United States  including restaurants in other cities such as New York City  Chicago  and Los Angeles  In response  American Express decided to reduce its discount rate gradually to compete more effectively and add new merchants to its network such as supermarkets and drugstores  Many elements of the exclusive acceptance program were also phased out so American Express could effectively encourage businesses to add American Express cards to their existing list of payment options  Currently  American Express  average US merchant rate is about 2 89   citation needed  while the average Discover  Mastercard  and Visa U S  merchant rate is about 2  citation needed   Visa MasterCard signature debit cards are at 1 7   citation needed   Some merchant sectors  such as quick service restaurants including McDonald s  have special reduced rates to accommodate business needs and profit   edit  Cable TV American Express formed a joint venture with Warner Communications in 1979 called Warner Amex Satellite Entertainment  which created MTV  Nickelodeon  and The Movie Channel  The partnership only lasted until 1984  The properties were sold to Viacom soon after   edit  Conversion to bank holding company On November 10  2008  during the financial crisis of 2008  the company won Federal Reserve System approval to convert to a bank holding company  making it eligible for government help under the Troubled Asset Relief Program  18  At that time  American Express had total consolidated assets of about  127 billion  18  In June 2009   3 39 billion in TARP funds were repaid plus  74 4 million in dividend payments  and in July 2009 they ended their obligations under TARP by buying back  340 million in Treasury warrants  19  20   edit  Controversy in the UK In November 2010 the UK division of American Express was cautioned by the Office of Fair Trading for the use of controversial charging orders against those in debt  21  The regulator said that the company was one of four companies who were encouraging customers to turn their unsecured credit card debts into a form of secured debt   edit  Loyalty acquisition In March 2011  American Express completed a  685m purchase of Loyalty Partner  which operates the Payback loyalty program in Germany and Poland  and the i Mint loyalty program in India  22   edit  Business model  edit  Typical credit card business model When a consumer makes a purchase using a credit or charge card  a small portion of the price is paid as a fee  known as the merchant discount   with the merchant keeping the remainder  There are typically three parties who split this fee amongst themselves  Acquiring bank  the bank which processes credit card transactions for a merchant  including crediting the merchant s account for the value charged to a credit card less all fees  Issuing bank  the bank which issues the consumer s credit card  This is the bank a consumer is responsible for repaying after making a credit card purchase  The issuer s share of the merchant discount is known as the interchange fee  Network  the link between acquiring banks and issuing banks  These banks have relationships with a network  rather than with each other  for fulfilling card purchases  This allows a card issued by a community bank in Peru to be used at a shop in South Africa  for instance  without requiring the banks to have a direct relationship with each other  The two largest networks in the world are Visa and MasterCard  The average merchant discount in the United States is 1 9   Of this  approximately 0 1  goes to the acquirer  1 7  to the issuer  and 0 09  to the network  23  Most Prime and Superprime card issuers use the majority of their interchange revenue to fund loyalty programs like frequent flyer points and cash back  and hence their profit from card spending is small relative to the interest they earn from card lending   edit  Card products  edit  Consumer cards See also  Centurion Card  American Express Red  and ExpressPay American Express is best known for its iconic Green  Gold  and Platinum charge cards  and offers credit cards of similar color levels in most countries  In the 1950s  American Express issued its first credit card  which caught on quickly in the booming postwar economy and signaled the company s transition to a wider consumer base  In 1966  the company issued its first gold card  in an effort to cater to the upper echelon of business travel  Its platinum card debuted in the 1990s and continues to be immensely popular as it is second in exclusivity only to the Centurion Card  In 1999  American Express introduced the Centurion Card  often referred to as the  black card   which caters to an even more affluent and elite customer segment  The card was initially only available to select users of the Platinum card  The annual fee for the card is  2 500  up from  1 000 at introduction  with an additional one time initiation fee of  5 000  In addition to a variety of exclusive benefits  the card itself is made of titanium  American Express created the card line amid rumors and urban legends in the 1980s that it produced an ultra exclusive black card for elite users who could purchase anything with it  24  American Express cards range between no annual fee  for Blue and many other consumer and business cards  and a  450 annual fee  for the Platinum card   Annual fees for the Green card start at  55  first year free   while Gold card annual fees start at  85  American Express has several co

card  White in color  this card was created for people in their 20s and 30s  The card is currently in open beta testing and anyone can apply for it   edit  Card Design The company mascot  the Roman Gladiator or Centurion  appears at the center of the iconic Green  Gold  Platinum  and Centurion cards  The figure and his noble pose evoke themes from classical antiquity  which have historically been held in high regard in the Western world  and add to the cardholder s perceived prestige  These cards also feature intricate border and background designs that say  American Express   The unique designs on these cards  especially the Green card  seem to resemble those on United States Federal Reserve Notes  and enhance the image of the cardholder as an affluent and conspicuous consumer   edit  ExpressPay In 2005  American Express introduced ExpressPay  similar to MasterCard PayPass and Visa payWave  It is a contactless payment system based on wireless RFID  where transactions are completed by holding the credit card near a receiver at which point the debt is immediately added to the account  The card is not swiped and no PIN is entered  Many U S  merchant and restaurant partners now

January 2006  American Express sold its Bank of Hawaii card portfolio to Bank of America  MBNA   Bank of America will issue Visa and American Express cards under the Bank of Hawaii name  Until 2004  Visa and MasterCard rules prohibited issuers of their cards from issuing American Express cards in the United States  This meant  as a practical matter  that U S  banks could not issue American Express cards  These rules were struck down as a result of antitrust litigation brought by the U S  Department of Justice  and are no longer in effect  In January 2004  American Express reached a deal to have its cards issued by a U S  bank  MBNA America  Initially decried by MasterCard executives as nothing but an  experiment   these cards were released in October 2004  Some said that the relationship was going to be threatened by MBNA s merger with Bank of America  a major Visa issuer and original developer of Visa  However  an agreement was reached between American Express and Bank of America on December 21  2005  Under the terms of the agreement  Bank of America will own the customer loans and American Express will process the transactions  Also  American Express will dismiss

business travel   edit  Publishing Amex publishes the Travel   Leisure  Food  amp  Wine  Executive Travel  and Departures magazines   edit  Advertising In 1975  David Ogilvy of Ogilvy  amp  Mather developed the highly successful Don t Leave Home Without Them ad campaign for American Express Traveler s Cheques  featuring Oscar award winning actor Karl Malden  Karl Malden served as the public face of American Express Travelers Cheques for 25 years  In the UK the spokesman was instead the television personality Alan Whicker  After Karl Malden s departure and as the card was promoted over the traveller s cheques  American Express continued to use celebrities  such as Mel Blanc and ballerina Cynthia Gregory  A typical ad for the American Express Card began with a celebrity asking viewers   Do you know me   Although he she gave hints to his her identity  the star s name was never mentioned except as imprinted on an American Express Card  after which announcer Peter Thomas told viewers how to apply for it  Each ad concluded with the celebrity reminding viewers   Don t Leave Home Without It   The  Don t Leave Home Without It  slogan was revived in 2005 for the prepaid American Express Travelers Cheque Card  These slogans have been parodied numerous times  The long running PBS children s TV series Sesame Street parodied the  Do you know me  Don t Leave Home Without It  ad campaigns with three skits involving a Muppet character holding a Grown Up Friend s hand while crossing the street  One skit featured Forgetful Jones  performed by Richard Hunt  with Olivia  Alaina Reed Hall  as his Grown Up Friend  a second featured Bert and Ernie  Frank Oz and Jim Henson respectively  with Gordon  Roscoe Orman  as their Grown Up Friend  and the third featured Big Bird  Caroll Spinney  with Bob  Bob McGrath  as his Grown Up Friend  All three skits ended with their names being embossed at the bottom of a card looking like an American Express card that had a big human left hand in the middle with the words  Grown Up Friend s Hand  above it  and a voiceover saying  A Grown Up Friend s Hand  Don t cross the street without it   Another parody was seen on an episode of the CBS game show Press Your Luck  when the animated  Whammy Character  would give the  Do you know me   tag line  followed by the display of an AmEx card parody  which then had  WHAMMY  typed in on the bottom line of the card  In a campaign speech during the 1984 Election  President Ronald Reagan said  If the big spenders get their way  they ll charge everything to your taxpayer s express card  and believe me  they never leave home without it   On the 1997 film Hercules during the song  Zero to Hero   the credit card is  Grecian Express   The 1989 movie Major League also parodied the campaign  In one scene  in which every player is dressed in a tuxedo  the Cleveland Indians tell viewers of the film why every player carries the American Express Card with much of the explanation done one line at a time by players Jake Taylor  Tom Berenger   Eddie Harris  Chelcie Ross   Rick  Wild Thing  Vaughn  Charlie Sheen   Pedro Cerrano  Dennis Haysbert   and Roger Dorn  Corbin Bernsen   and Manager Lou Brown  James Gammon   The scene ends with Willie  Mays  Hayes  a tuxedo clad Wesley Snipes  sliding into home plate in front of the rest of the team  holding up his card and saying to the viewers   The American Express Card  Don t steal home without it   In Batman  amp  Robin Batman pulls out a Bat Credit card and says he never leaves the cave without it  The Adventures of Seinfeld  amp  Superman American Express continues to use celebrities in their ads  Some notable examples include a late 1990s ad campaign with comedian Jerry Seinfeld  including the two 2004 webisodes in a series entitled  The Adventures of Seinfeld  amp  Superman   In late 2004  American Express launched the  My life  My card   brand campaign  also by Ogilvy  amp  Mather  featuring famous American Express cardmembers talking about their life  The ads have featured actors Kate Winslet  Robert De Niro  Ken Watanabe and Tina Fey  Duke University basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski  fashion designer Collette Dinnigan  comedian and talk show hostess Ellen DeGeneres  golfer Tiger Woods  professional snowboarder Shaun White  tennis pros Venus Williams and Andy Roddick  Real Madrid manager Jos  Mourinho  and film directors Martin Scorsese  Wes Anderson  M  Night Shyamalan and most recently singer Beyonc  Knowles  In 2007  a two minute black and white ad entitled  Animals  starring Ellen DeGeneres won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Commercial  Many American Express credit card ads feature a sample American Express Card with the name  C F Frost  on the front  This is not a fabricated name  as Charles F  Frost was an advertising executive from Ogilvy  amp  Mather  35  In addition  American Express was one of the earliest users of cause marketing  to great success  citation needed  A 1983 promotion advertised that for each purchase made with an American Express Card  American Express would contribute one penny to the renovation of the Statue of Liberty  The campaign generated contributions of  1 7 million to the Statue of Liberty restoration project  What would soon capture the attention of marketing departments of major corporations was that the promotion generated approximately a 28  increase in American Express card usage by consumers  Building on its earlier promotion  American Express later conducted a four year Charge Against Hunger program  which generated approximately  22 million for a charity addressing poverty and hunger relief  In 2006  as part of Bono s Product Red  American Express launched the American Express Red Card with campaign starred by supermodel Gisele B ndchen  The card  currently available only in the United Kingdom  makes a donation to fight AIDS with every purchase made using the card  In May 2007  American Express launched an initiative called the Members Project  36  37  Cardholders were invited to submit ideas for projects and American Express is funding the winning  provide clean drinking water  project  2 million   edit  Brand American Express has a long history of appealing to its customers by portraying itself as a company on the cutting edge of technology and luxury  38  By associating itself early on with banks and the upper classes  American Express has been able to generate an aura of exclusivity that adds to its brand appeal even today  The company s introduction of its traveler s checks in the early 20th century integrated well into the lavish lifestyles of its affluent  globetrotting luxury customers  resulting in an increase in popularity and profitability for the company over the pre WWII decades  39  From luxury steamship services in the 1920 s to the credit and charge cards it currently offers  American Express particularly appeals to individuals in search of prestige as evidenced by slogans such as the one that appears on the magazine for its Platinum Cardholders  Departures  which reads   The Luxury Sourcebook for Affluent  Educated  Well Travelled Consumers   40  Although American Express still caters to ultra high net worth individuals  over the years  the company has expanded its line of products  such as its charge cards  to attract a wider economic demographic by marketing the popular concept of affordable luxury  A recent example of this appeal to affordability is an advertisement on American Express  home page which declares  you re not dreaming vente privee is now available in the U S   bringing you many of the world s leading luxury and fashion brands at up to 70  off  Join Now  vente privee with American Express    41   edit
