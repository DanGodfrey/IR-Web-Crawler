establishes symbols that relate humanity to spirituality and  sometimes  to moral values  1  Many religions have narratives  symbols  traditions and sacred histories that are intended to give meaning to life or to explain the origin of life or the universe  They tend to derive morality  ethics  religious laws or a preferred lifestyle from their ideas about the cosmos and human nature  The word religion is sometimes used interchangeably with faith or belief system  but religion differs from private belief in that it has a public aspect citation needed   Most religions have organized behaviors  including clerical hierarchies  a definition of what constitutes adherence or membership  congregations of laity  regular meetings or services for the purposes of veneration of a deity or for prayer  holy places  either natural or architectural   and or scriptures  The practice of a religion may also include sermons  commemoration of the activities of a god or gods  sacrifices  festivals  feasts  trance  initiations  funerary services  matrimonial services  meditation  music  art  dance  public service  or other aspects of human culture  The development of religion has taken different forms in different cultures  Some religions place an emphasis on belief  while others emphasize practice  Some religions focus on the subjective experience of the religious individual  while others consider the activities of the religious community to be most important  Some religions claim to be universal  believing their laws and cosmology to be binding for everyone  while others are intended to be practiced only by a closely defined or localized group  In many places religion has been associated with public institutions such as education  hospitals  the family  government  and political hierarchies  Anthropologists John Monoghan and Peter Just state that   it seems apparent that one thing religion or belief helps us do is deal with problems of human life that are significant  persistent  and intolerable  One important way in which religious beliefs accomplish this is by providing a set of ideas about how and why the world is put together that allows people to accommodate anxieties and deal with misfortune   2  Some academics studying the subject have divided religions into three broad categories  world religions  a term which refers to transcultural  international faiths  indigenous religions  which refers to smaller  culture specific or nation specific religious groups  and new religious movements  which refers to recently developed faiths  3  One modern academic theory of religion  social constructionism  says that religion is a modern concept that suggests all spiritual practice and worship follows a model similar to the Abrahamic religions as an orientation system that helps to interpret reality and define human beings  4  and thus religion  as a concept  has been applied inappropriately to non Western cultures that are not based upon such systems  or in which these systems are a substantially simpler construct  Contents 1 Etymology 2 Origins 3 Religious movements 3 1 Types of religion 4 Issues in religion 4 1 Interfaith

Fr  religion  religious community   from L  religionem  nom  religio   respect for what is sacred  reverence for the gods   5   obligation  the bond between man and the gods  6   is derived from the Latin religi   the ultimate origins of which are obscure  One possibility is derivation from a reduplicated  le ligare  an interpretation traced to Cicero connecting lego  read   i e  re  again    lego in the sense of  choose    go over again  or  consider carefully   Modern scholars such as Tom Harpur and Joseph Campbell favor the derivation from ligare  bind  connect   probably from a prefixed re ligare  i e  re  again    ligare or  to reconnect   which was made prominent by St  Augustine  following the interpretation of Lactantius  7  8  The medieval usage alternates with order in designating bonded communities like those of monastic orders   we hear of the  religion  of the Golden Fleece  of a knight  of the religion of Avys    9  According to the philologist Max M ller  the root of the English word  religion   the Latin religio  was originally used to mean only  reverence for God or the gods  careful pondering of divine things  piety   which Cicero further derived to mean  diligence    10  11 Max M ller characterized many other cultures around the world  including Egypt  Persia  and India  as having a similar power structure at this point in history  What is called ancient religion today  they would have only called  law   12  Many languages have words that can be translated as  religion   but they may use them in a very different way  and some have no word for religion at all  For example  the Sanskrit word dharma  sometimes translated as  religion   also means law  Throughout classical South Asia  the study of law consisted of concepts such as penance through piety and ceremonial as well as practical traditions  Medieval Japan at first had a similar union between  imperial law  and universal or  Buddha law   but these later became independent sources of power  13  14  There is no precise equivalent of  religion  in Hebrew  and Judaism does not distinguish clearly between religious  national  racial  or ethnic identities  15  One of its central concepts is  halakha   sometimes translated as  law    which guides religious practice and belief and many aspects of daily life  The use of other terms  such as obedience to God or Islam are likewise grounded in particular histories and vocabularies  16  Major denominations and religions of the world Origins There are a number of theories regarding the origins of religion  Greg M  Epstein  a Humanist chaplain at Harvard University  states that  essentially all the world s major religions were founded on the principle that divine beings or forces can promise a level of justice in a supernatural realm that cannot be perceived in this natural one   17  According to anthropologists John Monaghan and Peter Just  Many of the great world religions appear to have begun as revitalization movements of some sort  as the vision of a charismatic prophet fires the imaginations of people seeking a more comprehensive answer to their problems than they feel is provided by everyday beliefs  Charismatic individuals have emerged at many times and places in the world  It seems that the key to long term success   and many movements come and go with little long term effect   has relatively little to do with the prophets  who appear with surprising regularity  but more to do with the development of a group of supporters who are able to institutionalize the movement  18  Religious movements Main article  Major religious groups In the 19th and 20th centuries  the academic practice of comparative religion divided religious belief into philosophically defined categories called  world religions   However  some recent scholarship has argued that not all types of religion are necessarily separated by mutually exclusive philosophies  and furthermore that the utility of ascribing a practice to a certain philosophy  or even calling a given practice religious  rather than cultural  political  or social in nature  is limited  19  20  21  The current state of psychological study about the nature of religiousness suggests that it is better to refer to religion as a largely invariant phenomenon that should be distinguished from cultural norms  i e   religions    22  The list of religious movements given here is therefore an attempt to summarize the most important regional and philosophical influences on local communities  but it is by no means a complete description of every religious community  nor does it explain the most important elements of individual religiousness  The four largest religious groups by population  estimated to account for between 5 and 7 billion people  are Christianity  Islam  Buddhism  and Hinduism  with the relative numbers for Buddhism and Hinduism dependent on the extent of syncretism   Four largest religions

the oldest Abrahamic religion  originating in the people of ancient Israel and Judea  Judaism is based primarily on the Torah  a text which some Jews believe was handed down to the people of Israel through the prophet Moses in 1 400 BCE  This along with the rest of the Hebrew Bible and the Talmud are the central texts of Judaism  The Jewish people were scattered after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE  Today there are about 13 million Jews  about 40 per cent living in Israel and 40 per cent in the United States  26  Christianity is based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth  1st century  as presented in the New Testament  The Christian faith is essentially faith in Jesus as the Christ  the Son of God  and as Savior and Lord  Almost all Christians believe in the Trinity  which teaches the unity of Father  Son  Jesus Christ   and Holy Spirit as three persons in one Godhead  Most Christians can describe their faith with the Nicene Creed  As the religion of Byzantine Empire in the first millennium and of Western Europe during the time of colonization  Christianity has been propagated throughout the world  The main divisions of Christianity are  according to the number of adherents  Catholic Church  headed by the Pope in Rome  is a communion of the Western church and 22 Eastern Catholic churches  Protestantism  separated from the Catholic Church in the 16th century Reformation and split in many denominations  Eastern Christianity which include Eastern Orthodoxy  Oriental Orthodoxy and the Church of the East  There are other smaller groups  such as Jehovah s Witnesses and the Latter Day Saint movement  whose inclusion in Christianity is sometimes disputed  Muslims praying around Kaaba  the most sacred site in Islam Islam refers to the religion taught by the Islamic prophet Muhammad  a major political and religious figure of the 7th century CE  Islam is the dominant religion of northern Africa  the Middle East  and South Asia  As with Christianity  there is no single orthodoxy in Islam but a multitude of traditions which are generally categorized as Sunni and Shia  although there are other minor groups as well  Wahhabi is the dominant Muslim schools of thought in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  There are also several Islamic republics  including Iran  which is run by a Shia Supreme Leader  The Bah    Faith was founded in the 19th century in Iran and since then has spread worldwide  It teaches unity of all religious philosophies and accepts all of the prophets of Judaism  Christianity  and Islam as well as additional prophets including its founder Bah  u ll h  Smaller regional Abrahamic groups  including Samaritanism  primarily in Israel and the West Bank   the Rastafari movement  primarily in Jamaica   and Druze  primarily in Syria and Lebanon   Hindu statue of Rama in Kalaram Temple  India  Indian religions are practiced or were founded in the Indian subcontinent  Concepts most of them share in common include dharma  karma  reincarnation  mantras  yantras  and dar ana  Hinduism is a synecdoche describing the similar philosophies of Vaishnavism  Shaivism  and related groups practiced or founded in the Indian subcontinent  Concepts most of them share in common include karma  caste  reincarnation  mantras  yantras  and dar ana  27  Hinduism is not a monolithic religion in the Romanic sense but a religious category containing dozens of separate philosophies amalgamated as San tana Dharma  Jainism  taught primarily by Parsva  9th century BCE  and Mahavira  6th century BCE   is an ancient Indian religion that prescribes a path of non violence for all forms of living beings in this world  Jains are found mostly in India  Buddhism was founded by Siddhattha Gotama in the 6th century BCE  Buddhists generally agree that Gotama aimed to help sentient beings end their suffering  dukkha  by understanding the true nature of phenomena  thereby escaping the cycle of suffering and rebirth  sa s ra   that is  achieving Nirvana  Theravada Buddhism  which is practiced mainly in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia alongside folk religion  shares some characteristics of Indian religions  It is based in a large collection of texts called the Pali Canon  Under the heading of Mahayana  the  Great Vehicle   fall a multitude of doctrines which began their development in China and are still relevant in Vietnam  in Korea  in Japan  and to a lesser extent in Europe and the United States  Mahayana Buddhism includes such disparate teachings as Zen  Pure Land  and Soka Gakkai  Vajrayana Buddhism  sometimes considered a form of Mahayana  was developed in Tibet and is still most prominent there and in surrounding regions  Two notable new Buddhist sects are H a H o and the Dalit Buddhist movement  which were developed separately in the 20th century  Sikhism is a monotheistic religion founded on the teachings of Guru Nanak and ten successive Sikh Gurus in 15th century Punjab  Sikhs are found mostly in India  There are dozens of new religious movements within Indian religions and Hindu reform movements  such as Ayyavazhi and Swaminarayan Faith  Zoroastrian Fire Temple Iranian religions are ancient religions which roots predate the Islamization of the Greater Iran  Nowadays these religions are practiced only by minorities  Zoroastrianism is a religion and philosophy based on the teachings of prophet Zoroaster in the 6th century BC  The Zoroastrians worship the Creator Ahura Mazda  In Zoroastrianism good and evil have distinct sources  with evil trying to destroy the creation of Mazda  and good trying to sustain it  Mandaeism is a monotheistic religion with a strongly dualistic worldview  Mandaeans are sometime labeled as the  Last Gnostics   Kurdish religions include the traditional beliefs of the Yazidi  Alevi  and Ahl e Haqq  Sometimes these are labeled Yazd nism  Incense burner in China Folk religion is a term applied loosely and vaguely to less organized local practices  It is also called paganism  shamanism  animism  ancestor worship  matriarchal religion  or totemism  although not all of these elements are necessarily present in local belief systems  The category of  folk religion  can generally include anything that is not part of an organization  Modern neopagan movement draws on folk religion for inspiration to varying degrees  African traditional religion is a category including any type of religion practiced in Africa before the arrival of Islam and Christianity  such as Yoruba religion or San religion  There are many varieties of religions developed by Africans in the Americas derived from African beliefs  including Santer a  Candombl   Umbanda  Vodou  and Oyotunji  Folk religions of the Americas include Aztec religion  Inca religion  Maya religion  and modern Catholic beliefs such as the Virgin of Guadalupe  Native American religion is practiced across the continent of North America  Australian Aboriginal culture contains a mythology and sacred practices characteristic of folk religion  Chinese folk religion  practiced by Chinese people around the world  is a primarily social practice including popular elements of Confucianism and Taoism  with some remnants of Mahayana Buddhism  Most Chinese do not identify as religious due to the strong Maoist influence on the country in recent history  but adherence to religious ceremonies remains common  New religious movements include Falun Gong and I Kuan Tao  Traditional Korean religion is a syncretic mixture of Mahayana Buddhism and Korean shamanism  Unlike Japanese Shinto  Korean shamanism was never codified and Buddhism was never made a social necessity  In some areas these traditions remain prevalent  but Korean influenced Christianity is also influential in society and politics in South Korea  Traditional Japanese religion is a mixture of Mahayana Buddhism and ancient indigenous practices which were codified as Shinto in the 19th century  Japanese people retain nominal attachment to both Buddhism and Shinto through social ceremonies  but irreligion is common  A Modern style Unitarian Universalist sanctuary A variety of new religious movements still practiced today have been founded in many other countries besides Japan and the United States  including  Shinsh ky  is a general category for a wide variety of religious movements founded in Japan since the 19th century  These movements share almost nothing in common except the place of their founding  The largest religious movements centered in Japan include Soka Gakkai  Tenrikyo  and Seicho No Ie among hundreds of smaller groups  Cao   i is a syncretistic  monotheistic religion  established in Vietnam in 1926  Unitarian Universalism is a religion characterized by support for a  free and responsible search for truth and meaning   and has no accepted creed or theology  Scientology teaches that people are immortal beings who have forgotten their true nature  Its method of spiritual rehabilitation is a type of counseling known as auditing  in which practitioners aim to consciously re experience painful or traumatic events in their past in order to free themselves of their limiting effects  Eckankar is a religion with the purpose of making God an everyday reality in one s life  Sociological classifications of religious movements suggest that within any given religious group  a community can resemble various types of structures  including  churches    denominations    sects    cults   and  institutions   The Hindu population of South Asia comprises about 2 000 castes  28  According to some Hindu literature  there are 330 million  including local and regional  Hindu deities  29  Types of religion History of religionsfounding

ethnic religions that are identified with a particular ethnic group and do not seek converts  30  Others reject the distinction  pointing out that all religious practices  whatever their philosophical origin  are ethnic because they come from a particular culture  31  32  33  Issues in religion Interfaith cooperation Because religion continues to be recognized in Western thought as a universal impulse  many religious practitioners have aimed to band together in interfaith dialogue  cooperation  and religious peacebuilding  The first major dialogue was the Parliament of the World s Religions at the 1893 Chicago World s Fair  which remains notable even today both in affirming  universal values  and recognition of the diversity of practices among different cultures  The 20th century has been especially fruitful in use of interfaith dialogue as a means of solving ethnic  political  or even religious conflict  with Christian Jewish reconciliation representing a complete reverse in the attitudes of many Christian communities towards Jews  Recent interfaith initiatives include  A Common Word   launched in 2007 and focused on bringing Muslim and Christian leaders together  34  the  C1 World Dialogue   35  the  Common Ground  initiative between Islam and Buddhism  36  and a United Nations sponsored  World Interfaith Harmony Week   37  38  Secularism and irreligion Main articles  Secularism and Irreligion See also  Criticism of religion  Atheism  Agnosticism  and Antireligion The terms  atheist   lack of belief in any gods  and  agnostic   belief in the unknowability of the existence of gods   though specifically contrary to theistic  e g  Christian  Jewish  and Muslim  religious teachings  do not by definition mean the opposite of  religious   There are religions  including Buddhism and Taoism   in fact  that classify some of their followers as agnostic  atheistic  or nontheistic  The true opposite of  religious  is the word  irreligious   Irreligion describes an absence of any religion  antireligion describes an active opposition or aversion toward religions in general  Critics of religion consider it to be to be outdated  harmful to the individual  e g  brainwashing of children  faith healing  circumcision   harmful to society  e g  holy wars  terrorism  wasteful distribution of resources   to impede the progress of science  and to encourage immoral acts  e g  blood sacrifice  discrimination against homosexuals and women   A major criticism of many religions is that they require beliefs that are irrational  unscientific  or unreasonable  because religious beliefs and traditions lack scientific or rational foundations  As religion became a more personal matter in Western culture  discussions of society found a new focus on political and scientific meaning  and religious attitudes  dominantly Christian  were increasingly seen as irrelevant for the needs of the European world  On the political side  Ludwig Feuerbach recast Christian beliefs in light of humanism  paving the way for Karl Marx s famous characterization of religion as  the opium of the people   Meanwhile  in the scientific community  T H  Huxley in 1869 coined the term  agnostic   a term subsequently adopted by such figures as Robert Ingersoll that  while directly conflicting with and novel to Christian tradition  is accepted and even embraced in some other religions  Later  Bertrand Russell told the world Why I Am Not a Christian  which influenced several later authors to discuss their breakaway from their own religious uprbringings from Islam to Hinduism  Some modern day critics  such as Bryan Caplan  hold that religion lacks utility in human society  they may regard religion as irrational  39  Nobel Peace Laureate Shirin Ebadi has spoken out against undemocratic Islamic countries justifying  oppressive acts  in the name of Islam  40  Related forms of thought Religion and superstition Further information  Superstition  Magical thinking  and Magic and religion Superstition has been described as  the incorrect establishment of cause and effect  or a false conception of causation  41  Religion is more complex and includes social institutions and morality  But religions may include superstitions or make use of magical thinking  Adherents of one religion sometimes think of other religions as superstition  42  43  Some atheists  deists  and skeptics regard religious belief as superstition  Greek and Roman pagans  who saw their relations with the gods in political and social terms  scorned the man who constantly trembled with fear at the thought of the gods  deisidaimonia   as a slave might fear a cruel and capricious master  The Romans called such fear of the gods superstitio  44 Early Christianity was outlawed as a superstitio Iudaica  a  Jewish superstition   by Domitian in the 80s AD  In AD 425  when Rome had become Christian  Theodosius II outlawed pagan traditions as superstitious  The Roman Catholic Church considers superstition to be sinful in the sense that it denotes a lack of trust in the divine providence of God and  as such  is a violation of the first of the Ten Commandments  The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that superstition  in some sense represents a perverse excess of religion   para   2110    Superstition   it says   is a deviation of religious feeling and of the practices this feeling imposes  It can even affect the worship we offer the true God  e g   when one attributes an importance in some way magical to certain practices otherwise lawful or necessary  To attribute the efficacy of prayers or of sacramental signs to their mere external performance  apart from the interior dispositions that they demand is to fall into superstition  Cf  Matthew 23 16 22   para   2111  Myth Main article  Mythology The word myth has several meanings  A traditional story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the world view of a people or explain a practice  belief  or natural phenomenon  A person or thing having only an imaginary or unverifiable existence  or A metaphor for the spiritual potentiality in the human being  45  Urarina shaman  1988 Ancient polytheistic religions  such as those of Greece  Rome  and Scandinavia  are usually categorized under the heading of mythology  Religions of pre industrial peoples  or cultures in development  are similarly called  myths  in the anthropology of religion  The term  myth  can be used pejoratively by both religious and non religious people  By defining another person s religious stories and beliefs as mythology  one implies that they are less real or true than one s own religious stories and beliefs  Joseph Campbell remarked   Mythology is often thought of as other people s religions  and religion can be defined as mis interpreted mythology   46  In sociology  however  the term myth has a non pejorative meaning  There  myth is defined as a story that is important for the group whether or not it is objectively or provably true  Examples include the death and resurrection of Jesus  which  to Christians  explains the means by which they are freed from sin and is also ostensibly a historical event  But from a mythological outlook  whether or not the event actually occurred is unimportant  Instead  the symbolism of the death of an old  life  and the start of a new  life  is what is most significant  Religious believers may or may not accept such symbolic interpretations  Religion and health Main article  Impacts of religion on health Mayo Clinic researchers examined the association between religious involvement and spirituality  and physical health  mental health  health related quality of life  and other health outcomes  The authors reported that   Most studies have shown that religious involvement and spirituality are associated with better health outcomes  including greater longevity  coping skills  and health related quality of life  even during terminal illness  and less anxiety  depression  and suicide   47  Religion and violence Main article  Religious violence See also  Christianity and violence  Judaism and violence  and Islam and violence The Crusades were a series of a military campaigns fought mainly between Christian Europe and Muslims  Shown here is a battle scene from the First Crusade  They were inspired at the jihad of the Islam civilization  Charles Selengut characterizes the phrase  religion and violence  as  jarring   asserting that  religion is thought to be opposed to violence and a force for peace and reconciliation  He acknowledges  however  that  the history and scriptures of the world s religions tell stories of violence and war as they speak of peace and love   48  Hector Avalos argues that  because religions claim divine favor for themselves  over and against other groups  this sense of righteousness leads to violence because conflicting claims to superiority  based on unverifiable appeals to God  cannot be adjudicated objectively  49  Critics of religion Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins go further and argue that religions do tremendous harm to society by using violence to promote their goals  in ways that are endorsed and exploited by their leaders  50  page needed  51  page needed  Regina Schwartz argues that all monotheistic religions are inherently violent because of an exclusivism that inevitably fosters violence against those that are considered outsiders  52  Lawrence Wechsler asserts that Schwartz isn t just arguing that Abrahamic religions have a violent legacy  but that the legacy is actually genocidal in nature  53  Byron Bland asserts that one of the most prominent reasons for the  rise of the secular in Western thought  was the reaction against the religious violence of the 16th and 17th centuries  He asserts that   t he secular was a way of living with the religious differences that had produced so much horror  Under secularity  political entities have a warrant to make decisions independent from the need to enforce particular versions of religious orthodoxy  Indeed  they may run counter to certain strongly held beliefs if made in the interest of common welfare  Thus  one of the important goals of the secular is to limit violence   54  Nonetheless  believers have used similar arguments when responding to atheists in these discussions  pointing to the widespread imprisonment and mass murder of individuals under atheist states in the twentieth century  55  56  57    And who can deny that Stalin and Mao  not to mention Pol Pot and a host of others  all committed atrocities in the name of a Communist ideology that was explicitly atheistic  Who can dispute that they did their bloody deeds by claiming to be establishing a  new man  and a religion free utopia  These were mass murders performed with atheism as a central part of their ideological inspiration  they were not mass murders done by people who simply happened to be atheist   Dinesh D Souza 57    Religion and the law This section requires expansion  There are laws and statutes that make reference to religion  58  This has led scholar Winnifred Sullivan to claims that religious freedom is impossible  59  Others argue that the Western legal principle of separation of church and state tends to engender a new  more inclusive civil religion  60  Religion and science Main articles  Relationship between religion and science and Epistemology Religious knowledge  according to religious practitioners  may be gained from religious leaders  sacred texts  scriptures  or personal revelation  Some religions view such knowledge as unlimited in scope and suitable to answer any question  others see religious knowledge as playing a more restricted role  often as a complement to knowledge gained through physical observation  Adherents to various religious faiths often maintain that religious knowledge obtained via sacred texts or revelation is absolute and infallible and thereby creates an accompanying religious cosmology  although the proof for such is often tautological and generally limited to the religious texts and revelations that form the foundation of their belief  In contrast  the scientific method gains knowledge by testing hypotheses to develop theories through elucidation of facts or evaluation by experiments and thus only answers cosmological questions about the universe that can be observed and measured  It develops theories of the world which best fit physically observed evidence  All scientific knowledge is subject to later refinement  or even outright rejection  in the face of additional evidence  Scientific theories that have an overwhelming preponderance of favorable evidence are often treated as de facto verities in general parlance  such as the theories of general relativity and natural selection to explain respectively the mechanisms of gravity and evolution  Religion as a Christian concept The social constructionists In recent years  some academic writers have described religion according to the theory of social constructionism  which considers how ideas and social phenomena develop in a social context  Among the main proponents of this theory of religion are Timothy Fitzgerald  Daniel Dubuisson and Talal Asad  The social constructionists argue that religion is a modern concept that developed from Christianity and was then applied inappropriately to non Western cultures  Dubuisson  a French anthropologist  says that the idea of religion has changed a lot over time and that one cannot fully understand its development by relying on etymology  which  tends to minimize or cancel out the role of history   61   What the West and the history of religions in its wake have objectified under the name  religion    he says    is     something quite unique  which could be appropriate only to itself and its own history   61  He notes that St  Augustine s definition of religio differed from the way we used the modern word  religion   61  Dubuisson prefers the term  cosmographic formation  to religion  Dubuisson says that  with the emergence of religion as a category separate from culture and society  there arose religious studies  The initial purpose of religious studies was to demonstrate the superiority of the  living  or  universal  European world view to the  dead  or  ethnic  religions scattered throughout the rest of the world  expanding the teleological project of Schleiermacher and Tiele to a worldwide ideal religiousness  62  Due to shifting theological currents  this was eventually supplanted by a liberal ecumenical interest in searching for Western style universal truths in every cultural tradition  63 Clifford Geertz s definition of religion as a  cultural system  was proposed in the 20th century and continues to be widely accepted today  According to Fitzgerald  the history of other cultures  interaction with the religious category is not about a universal constant  clarification needed  but rather concerns a particular idea that first developed in Europe under the influence of Christianity  64  Fitzgerald argues that from about the 4th century CE Western Europe and the rest of the world diverged  As Christianity became commonplace  the charismatic authority identified by Augustine  a quality we might today call  religiousness   exerted a commanding influence at the local level  This system persisted in the eastern Byzantine Empire following the East West Schism  but Western Europe regulated unpredictable expressions of charisma through the Roman Catholic Church  As the Church lost its dominance during the Protestant Reformation and Christianity became closely tied to political structures  religion was recast as the basis of national sovereignty  and religious identity gradually became a less universal sense of spirituality and more divisive  locally defined  and tied to nationality  65  It was at this point that  religion  was dissociated with universal beliefs and moved closer to dogma in both meaning and practice  However there was not yet the idea of dogma as personal choice  only of established churches  With the Enlightenment religion lost its attachment to nationality  says Fitzgerald  but rather than becoming a universal social attitude  it now became a personal feeling or emotion  66 Friedrich Schleiermacher in the late 18th century defined religion as das schlechthinnige Abh ngigkeitsgef hl  commonly translated as  a feeling of absolute dependence   67  His contemporary Hegel disagreed thoroughly  defining religion as  the Divine Spirit becoming conscious of Himself through the finite spirit   68  Asad argues that before the word  religion  came into common usage  Christianity was a disciplina  a  rule  just like that of the Roman Empire  This idea can be found in the writings of St  Augustine  354 430   Christianity was then a power structure opposing and superseding human institutions  a literal Kingdom of Heaven  It was the discipline taught by one s family  school  church  and city authorities  rather than something calling one to self discipline through symbols  69  These ideas are developed by S  N  Balagangadhara  In the Age of Enlightenment  Balagangadhara says that the idea of Christianity as the purest expression of spirituality was supplanted by the concept of  religion  as a worldwide practice  70  This caused such ideas as religious freedom  a reexamination of classical philosophy as an alternative to Christian thought  and more radically Deism among intellectuals such as Voltaire  Much like Christianity  the idea of  religious freedom  was exported around the world as a civilizing technique  even to regions such as India that had never treated spirituality as a matter of political identity  19  In Japan  where Buddhism was still seen as a philosophy of natural law  71  the concept of  religion  and  religious freedom  as separate from other power structures was unnecessary until Christian missionaries demanded free access to conversion  and when Japanese Christians refused to engage in patriotic events  72  Confucianism  Taoism  and Buddhism are one  a painting in the litang style portraying three men laughing by a river stream  12th century  Song Dynasty Other writers Similar views have been put forward by writers who are not social constructionists  George Lindbeck  a Lutheran and a postliberal theologian  says that religion does not refer to belief in  God  or a transcendent Absolute  but rather to  a kind of cultural and or linguistic framework or medium that shapes the entirety of life and thought     it is similar to an idiom that makes possible the description of realities  the formulation of beliefs  and the experiencing of inner attitudes  feelings  and sentiments   73 Nicholas de Lange  Professor of Hebrew and Jewish Studies at Cambridge University  says that  The comparative study of religions is an academic discipline which has been developed within Christian theology faculties  and it has a tendency to force widely differing phenomena into a kind of strait jacket cut to a Christian pattern  The problem is not only that other  religions  may have little or nothing to say about questions which are of burning importance for Christianity  but that they may not even see themselves as religions in precisely the same way in which Christianity sees itself as a religion   74  Criticism Main article  Criticism of religion Religious criticism has a long history  going back at least as far as the 5th century BCE in ancient Greece with Diagoras  the atheist  of Melos  and 1st century BCE in Rome with Titus Lucretius Carus s De Rerum Natura  and continuing to the present day with the advent of New Atheism  represented by such authors as Sam Harris  Daniel Dennett  Richard Dawkins  Victor J  Stenger  and Christopher Hitchens  Critics consider religion to be outdated  harmful to the individual  such as brainwashing of children  faith healing  circumcision   harmful to society  such as holy wars  terrorism  wasteful distribution of resources   to impede the progress of science  and to encourage immoral acts  such as blood sacrifice  discrimination against homosexuals and women   See also Religion portal
