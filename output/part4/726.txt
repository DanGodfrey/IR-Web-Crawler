scripts while George Scribner was signed on as director  being later joined by Allers  Production began in 1991  with most of the animators inexperienced or interested in animals as most of the Disney team wanted to work on Pocahontas instead  Some time after the staff traveled to Hell s Gate National Park to research on the film s setting and animals  Scribner left production disagreeing with the decision to turn the film into a musical  and was replaced by Minkoff  When Hahn joined the project  he was dissatisfied with the script and the story was promptly rewritten  Nearly 20 minutes of

Simba  he tells him that Simba cannot go to a shadowy place beyond the borders  Later that day  Simba s envious uncle Scar tells him that the shadowy place is in fact an elephant graveyard  Simba s curiosity is piqued  and he convinces his best friend Nala  a female lion cub  to come with him  At the graveyard  the cubs are attacked by three spotted hyenas  Shenzi  Banzai and Ed  before Mufasa rescues them  The hyenas are in fact friends of Scar  who then plots with them to take over the Pride Lands  On Scar s orders  the hyenas stampede a large pack of wildebeest into a gorge where Simba is  Mufasa rescues Simba  but as Mufasa attempts to flee by climbing the gorge s walls  Scar throws his brother back into the stampede  killing him  After Simba finds Mufasa s body in the gorge  Scar tricks him into thinking that Mufasa s death is his fault  and afterwards advises him to run away and to never come back  As Simba leaves  Scar orders the hyenas to go after Simba  but the cub is able to escape  Scar then announces to the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed and steps forward as the new king  Simba  now far from home  collapses in the desert from exhaustion  but is found by Timon and Pumbaa  a meerkat and a warthog who nurse him back to health  Timon and Pumba then take Simba in  and the lion grows on a carefree life under the motto  hakuna matata   Years later  Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness  who turns out to be Nala  The two reconcile and begin falling in love  Nala tries to get Simba to come back home by saying that because of Scar allowing the hyenas to live in the Pride Lands  it has become a wasteland with not enough food and water  Still feeling guilt over his father s death  Simba refuses to return and storms off  Wise mandrill Rafiki tracks Simba down  telling that Mufasa is still  alive  and then takes Simba to a pond and tells him to look into the water  Seeing only his reflection at first  Simba looks harder and sees an image of Mufasa  Rafiki says that Mufasa lives within him as a large storm cloud appears overhead and a specter of Mufasa speaks out to Simba  saying that he has forgotten who he is and that he must take his rightful place as the true king of Pride Rock  Simba then realizes that he can no longer run from his past and goes back home  Nala  Timon and Pumbaa follow him  and agree to help him fight  At the Pride Lands  Simba confronts Scar on Pride Rock  Scar backs Simba up to the end of Pride Rock to the point where Simba slips over the edge  dangling by his paws  Scar taunts him and then whispers that he killed Mufasa  The enraged Simba leaps back up and pins Scar  forcing his uncle to reveal the truth to the other lions  A fight ensues between the hyenas and lionesses while Simba chases and confronts Scar alone at the top of Pride Rock  Scar begs Simba for mercy  saying he is family and accusing the hyenas of planning everything  Simba says he does not believe Scar anymore  but spares his life and tells him to run away and never return  Scar meekly walks past him  but afterwards attacks his nephew  After a fierce battle  Simba triumphs and throws Scar off of Pride Rock  Scar survives the fall  but is attacked and killed by the hyenas  who overheard his attempt to betray them  With Scar and the hyenas gone  Simba descends from the top of Pride Rock where he is acknowledged by the pride as the rain falls again  Sometime later  Pride Rock is restored to its former glory and Simba looks down happily at his kingdom with Nala  Timon  and Pumbaa by his side

late 1988 during a conversation between Jeffrey Katzenberg  Roy E  Disney and Peter Schneider on a plane to Europe to promote the film Oliver and Company  During the conversation  the topic of a story set in Africa came up  and Katzenberg immediately jumped at the idea  7  Producer Thomas Schumacher  who had just completed The Rescuers Down Under  decided to attach himself to the project  because lions are cool   The idea was then developed by Walt Disney Feature Animation s vice president for creative affairs Charlie Fink  8  Katzenberg decided to add elements involving coming of age and death  9  and ideas from personal life experiences  such as some of his trials in his bumpy road in politics  saying about the film   It is a little bit about myself   9  In November of that year Thomas Disch  author of The Brave Little Toaster  wrote a treatment  entitled King of the Kalahari  10  and afterwards Linda Woolverton spent an year writing drafts of the script  which was titled King of the Beasts and then King of the Jungle  8  The original version of the film was very different from the final film  The plot was centered in a battle being between lions and baboons with Scar being the leader of the baboons  Rafiki being a cheetah  9  and Timon and Pumbaa being Simba s childhood friends  11  Simba would also not leave the kingdom  but become a  lazy  slovenly  horrible character  due to manipulations from Scar  so Simba could be overthrown after coming of age  8  Oliver and Company director George Scribner was the initial director of the film  12  being later joined by Roger Allers  who was the lead story man on Beauty and the Beast in October 1991  7  Allers brought with him Brenda Chapman  who would become the head of story  8  After six months of story development work Scribner decided to leave the project  as he clashed with Allers and the producers on their decision to turn the film into a musical  as Scribner s intention was of making a documentary like film more focused on natural aspects  7  13 Rob Minkoff replaced Scribner  and producer Don Hahn joined the production  Hahn found the script unfocused and lacking a clear theme  and after establishing the main theme as  leaving childhood and facing up to the realities of the world   asked for a final retool  Allers  Minkoff  Chapman and Hahn then rewrote the story across two weeks of meetings with directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale  who had just finished Beauty and the Beast  14  The script also had its title changed from King of the Jungle to The Lion King  as the setting was not the jungle but the savannah  7 The Lion King was the first Disney animated feature to be an original story  rather than being based on an already existing work  The filmmakers have said that the story of The Lion King was inspired by the Joseph and Moses stories from the Bible and William Shakespeare s Hamlet  15  During the summer of 1992  the team was joined by screenwriter Irene Mecchi  with a second screenwriter  Jonathan Roberts  joining a few months later  Mecchi and Roberts took charge of the revision process  fixing unresolved emotional issues in the script and adding comic business for Pumbaa  Timon and the hyenas  16  Lyricist Tim Rice worked closely with the writing team  flying to California at least once a month  as his songs needed to work in the narrative continuity  Rice s lyrics   which were reworked up to the production s end   were even pinned to the storyboards during development  14  Rewrites were frequent  with animator Andreas Deja saying that completed scenes would be delivered only for the response to be that parts needed to be reanimated due to dialog changes  8  Casting The voice actors were chosen for how they fit and could add to the characters   for instance  James Earl Jones was cast because the directors found his voice  powerful  and similar to a lion s roar  Nathan Lane originally auditioned for Zazu  and Ernie Sabella for a hyena  Upon meeting each other at the recording studio  the actors  who at the time were co stars in Guys and Dolls  asked to record together as hyenas  The directors laughed at their performance and decided to cast the duo as Timon and Pumbaa  17  18  For the hyenas  the original intention was reuniting Cheech  amp  Chong  but while Cheech Marin accepted to play Banzai  Tommy Chong was unavailable  Thus his role was changed into a female hyena  Shenzi  played by Whoopi Goldberg  11  Animation  The Lion King was considered a little movie because we were going to take some risks  The pitch for the story was a lion cub gets framed for murder by his uncle set to the music of Elton John  People said   What  Good luck with that   But for some reason  the people who ended up on the movie were highly passionate about it and motivated   Don Hahn 17  The development of The Lion King started concurrently with Pocahontas  which most of the animators of Walt Disney Feature Animation decided to work on instead  believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two  15  The story artists also did not have much faith in the project  with Brenda Chapman declaring she was reluctant to accept the job  because the story wasn t very good   8  and writer Burny Mattinson saying to co worker Joe Ranft about the film that  I don t know who is going to want to watch that one   13  Most of the leading animators were either doing their first major work supervising a character  or had much interest in animating an animal  9  Thirteen of these supervising animators  both in California and Florida  were responsible for establishing the personalities and setting the tone for the film s main characters  The animation leads for the main characters included Mark Henn on young Simba  Ruben A  Aquino on adult Simba  Andreas Deja on Scar  Aaron Blaise on young Nala  Anthony DeRosa on adult Nala  and Tony Fucile on Mufasa  16  Nearly 20 minutes of the film  including the  I Just Can t Wait to Be King  sequence  11  were animated at the Disney MGM Studios facility  Ultimately  more than 600 artists  animators and technicians contributed to The Lion King over the course of its production  12  Weeks before the film was to be released  production was affected by the 1994 Northridge earthquake  which shut off the studio and required the animators to finish their work from home  19  The character animators studied real life animals for reference  as was done for the 1942 Disney film Bambi  Jim Fowler  renowned wildlife expert  visited the studios on several occasions with an assortment of lions and other savannah inhabitants to discuss behavior and help the animators give their drawings an authentic feel  14  During pre production in 1991  several of the lead crew members  including Allers  Scribner  Hahn  Chapman  and production designer Chris Sanders  had taken a trip to Hell s Gate National Park in Kenya  in order to study and gain an appreciation of the environment for the film  The Pride Lands are modeled on the national park  Varied focal lengths and lenses were employed to differ from the habitual portrayal of Africa in documentaries   which employ telephoto lenses to shoot the wildlife from a distance  The epic feel drew inspiration from concept studies by artist Hans Bacher   which  following Scribner s request for realism  tried to depict effects such as lens flare   and the works of painters Charles Marion Russell  Frederic Remington and Maxfield Parrish  14  20  Since the characters were not anthropomorphized  all the animators had to learn to draw four legged animals  and the story and character development was done through usage of longer shots following the characters  11  The use of computers helped the filmmakers present their vision in new ways  The most notable use of computer animation is in the  wildebeest stampede  sequence  Several distinct wildebeest characters were created in a 3D computer program  multiplied into hundreds  cel shaded to look like drawn animation  and given randomized paths down a mountainside to simulate the real  unpredictable movement of a herd   21  Five specially trained animators and technicians spent more than two years creating the two and a half minute stampede sequence  16  Other usages of computer animation were done through CAPS  which helped simulate camera movements such as tracking shots  and was employed on the coloring  lighting and particle effects  11  The enthusiastic audience reception to an early Lion King film trailer  which consisted solely of the opening sequence with the song  Circle of Life   suggested that the film would be very successful  While both The Lion King and Pocahontas were commercial successes  The Lion King received more positive feedback and earned larger grosses than did Pocahontas  released one year later  22  23  24  Music Main article  The Lion King  soundtrack  Lyricist Tim Rice  who was working with composer Alan Menken on songs for Aladdin  was invited to write the songs  and accepted on the condition of finding a composing partner  As Menken was unavailable  the producers accepted Rice s suggestion of Elton John  18  after Rice s invitation of ABBA fell through due to Benny Andersson being busy with the musical Kristina fr n Duvem la  9  John expressed an interest of writing  ultra pop songs that kids would like  then adults can go and see those movies and get just as much pleasure out of them   mentioning a possible influence of The Jungle Book  where he felt the  music was so funny and appealed to kids and adults   25  John and Rice wrote five original songs for this film   Circle of Life    I Just Can t Wait to Be King    Be Prepared    Hakuna Matata  and  Can You Feel the Love Tonight   with the singer s performance of  Can You Feel the Love Tonight  over the end credits  26  The IMAX and DVD releases added another song   The Morning Report   which was based on a song discarded during development that eventually got featured in the live musical version of The Lion King  27  The film s score was composed by Hans Zimmer  who was hired based on his work in two films in African settings  The Power of One and A World Apart  14  and supplemented the score with traditional African music and choir elements arranged by Lebo M  26  The film s original motion picture soundtrack was released on July 13  1994  It was the fourth best selling album of the year on the Billboard 200 and the top selling soundtrack  28  It is the only soundtrack for an animated film to be Diamond certified  10x platinum   A bootleg recording exists of Hans Zimmer s complete instrumental score for the film  but it has never been given a full release by Disney  29  30  The use of the song  The Lion Sleeps Tonight  in a scene with Timon and Pumbaa has led to disputes between Disney and the family of South African Solomon Linda  who composed the song  originally titled  Mbube   in 1939  In July 2004  the family filed suit  seeking  1 6 million in royalties from Disney  In February 2006  Linda s heirs reached a legal settlement with Abilene Music  who held the worldwide rights and had licensed the song to Disney for an undisclosed amount of money  31  Release Promotion Upon release  The Lion King was accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign which included tie ins with Burger King  Mattel  Kodak  Nestl  and Payless ShoeSource  and various merchandise  32  accounting 186 licensed products  33  34  In 1994  Disney earned approximately  1 billion with products based on the film  35  with  214 million alone for Lion King toys during Christmas 1994  36  Box office Box office revenue Box office ranking Reference United States Foreign Worldwide All time

84 from the 13 reviews it collected  56  Chicago Sun Times film critic Roger Ebert called the film  a superbly drawn animated feature  and  in his print review wrote   The saga of Simba  which in its deeply buried origins owes something to Greek tragedy and certainly to Hamlet  is a learning experience as well as an entertainment   57  On the television program Siskel  amp  Ebert the film was praised but received a mixed reaction when compared to previous Disney films  Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert both gave the film a  Thumbs Up  but Siskel said that it was not as good as earlier films such as Beauty and the Beast and was  a good film  not a great one   58  Hal Hinson of The Washington Post called it  an impressive  almost daunting achievement  and felt that the film was  spectacular in a manner that has nearly become commonplace with Disney s feature length animations   but was less enthusiastic toward the end of his review saying   Shakespearean in tone  epic in scope  it seems more appropriate for grown ups than for kids  If truth be told  even for adults it is downright strange   59 Owen Gleiberman  film critic for Entertainment Weekly  praised the film and wrote that it  has the resonance to stand not just as a terrific cartoon but as an emotionally pungent movie   60 Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers praised the film and felt that it was  a hugely entertaining blend of music  fun and eye popping thrills  though it doesn t lack for heart   61  The staff of TV Guide wrote that  The film has some of Disney s most spectacular animation yet particularly in the wildebeest stampede and strong vocal performances  especially by skilled Broadway comedian Nathan Lane  However  it suffers from a curiously undeveloped story line   62 James Berardinelli  film critic for ReelViews  praised the film saying   With each new animated release  Disney seems to be expanding its already broad horizons a little more  The Lion King is the most mature  in more than one sense  of these films  and there clearly has been a conscious effort to please adults as much as children  Happily  for those of us who generally stay far away from  cartoons   they have succeeded   63  Accolades The Lion King received four Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations  The film would go on to win two Golden Globes  for Best Motion Picture   Musical or Comedy and Best Original Score  64

Controversies Comparison of Kimba the White Lion  left  and The Lion King on Pride Rock  right   Further information  Kimba the White Lion The Lion King controversy Certain elements of the film were considered bear a resemblance to a famous 1960s Japanese anime television show  Kimba the White Lion  with characters having analogues  and various individual scenes being nearly identical in composition and camera angle  Matthew Broderick believed initially that he was in fact working on a remake of Kimba  since he was familiar with the Japanese original  91  Disney s official stance is that the similarities are all coincidental  92  Yoshihiro Shimizu  of Tezuka Productions  which created Kimba the White Lion  has refuted rumours that the studio was paid hush money by Disney but explains that they rejected urges from within the industry to sue because   we re a small  weak company  It wouldn t be worth it anyway     Disney s lawyers are among the top twenty in the world   93  The supposed  SEX  frame  Protests were raised against one scene where it appears as if the word  SEX  might have been embedded into the dust flying in the sky when Simba flops down  94  which conservative activist Donald Wildmon asserted was a subliminal message intended to promote sexual promiscuity  The film s animators have stated that the letters spell  SFX   a common abbreviation of  special effects    and was intended as an innocent  signature  created by the effects animation team  95  Hyena biologists protested against the animal s portrayal  one hyena researcher sued Disney studios for defamation of character  96  and another   who had organized the animators  visit to the University of California s Field Station for Behavioural Research  where they would observe and sketch captive hyenas   97  included boycotting The Lion King as a way of helping to preserve hyenas in the wild  98  Legacy Sequels and spin offs This unreferenced section requires citations to
