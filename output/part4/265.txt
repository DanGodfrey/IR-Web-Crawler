Wyoming  On September 27  1886 the cornerstone of Old Main was laid marking the beginning of the University of Wyoming  The stone is inscribed Domi Habuit Unde Disceret  which is often translated   He need not go away from home for instruction   The following year  the first class of 42 men and women began their college education  For the next decade the building housed classrooms  a library and administration offices  10  The style of Old Main set a precedent for all future University buildings  The main stone used is rough cut sandstone from a quarry east of Laramie and the trim stone is smooth Potsdam Sandstone from a quarry near Rawlins  Old Main was designed to be a monumental structure and was designed to be a symmetrical building with a prominent central spire as the focal point  The building was also designed to reflect the character of Wyoming and the rough stone and smooth trim represented the progressing frontier  The design of Old Main had a lasting effect on university structures  which is most visible by the use of sandstone fa ade on nearly every building  11  In 1916  the central spire was removed due to structural concerns and the auditorium was reduced in size during a 1936 renovation  In 1949  the building was thoroughly remodeled the auditorium and exterior stairs were completely removed  It also became officially known as Old Main and the name was carved above the east entrance  Currently  Old Main houses university administration including the President s Office and the board room where the Trustees often meet   edit  Prexy s Pasture   In order to preserve the natural and open beauty of that portion of the University of Wyoming campus commonly known and referred to as  Prexy s Pasture   no structures  other than ornamental improvements  or buildings of any kind or type shall be located or constructed upon  that  portion of the campus       Title 21 Chapter 17 Article 4 Part B  Wyoming Legislature Statute Prexy s Pasture is a large grassy area located within a ring of classroom and administrative buildings and serves as the center mall of the campus  The name is attributed to an obscure rule that the university president  or  prexy   is given exclusive use of the area for livestock grazing  During the administration of Arthur G  Crane the name   Prexy s Pasture   was formally declared  Prexy s  as it is often called today  is also known for the unique pattern formed by concrete pathways that students and faculty use to cross the pasture  12  When the University of Wyoming first opened its doors in 1887  Prexy s Pasture was nothing more than an actual pasture covered in native grasses  Over time  as the needs of the university has changed  the area has been altered and redesigned  The original design was established in 1924 and in 1949 the area was landscaped with Blue Spruce and Mugo Pine  13  In February 1965  the Board of Trustees decided to construct the new science center on the west side of Prexy s Pasture  The board president  Harold F  Newton  who was concerned about the location  leaked the decision to the local press  The uproar that followed caused the board to decide on a new location for the science center and resulted in a new state statute making it necessary for any new structure built on the pasture to receive legislative approval  14  The statue known as  University of Wyoming Family   was installed in 1983 by UW Professor Robert Russin in anticipation of the centennial celebration  15    The template below  Wide image  is being considered for merging  See templates for discussion to help reach a consensus    Panorama of Prexy s Pasture at the University of Wyoming In the summer of 2004  Prexy s Pasture was remodeled as the first step in a two part redesign project  This step involved removing the asphalt roadway that circled the pasture and replacing it with concrete walkways to make the area a walking campus  as recommended by the 1966 and 1991 Campus Master Plans  The grassy area was also increased and new lampposts were installed for better lighting  The second phase of the project involves the construction of a plaza at each corner featuring trees and rocks styled after the rocky outcrops of nearby Vedauwoo  16  Two of the plazas  Simpson Plaza and Cheney Plaza  have been completed  Currently  several exhibits from the exhibition Sculpture  A Wyoming Invitational are featured along the exterior walkway  17  Also  outside of its primary use by students travelling to and from classes or socializing  the area is also host to campus barbecues and fall welcome events  18   edit  Wyoming Union The west entrance of Wyoming Union In September 1937  with the approval of the Wyoming State Legislature  President Arthur G  Crane obtained a Public Works Administration loan for  149 250 to be used for construction of a student union  On March 3  1938  ground was broken and construction began on what would become the Wyoming Union  Many students were involved in the construction and twenty five students were trained to be stone cutters  From the beginning  the Wyoming Union housed an assortment of student needs and activities  The formal and informal social needs were met by including a ballroom  banquet room  lounges  and game rooms  Offices for student government  committees  organizations  and publications were included to help meet the political and organizational needs of the student population  Lastly  a student store  post office  and bookstore completed the design  The original design has been modified several times to accommodate changing needs and a growing student population  The first addition was completed in January 1960  This section  added to the northeast of the original structure  expanded the ballroom  created a lounge area and senate chambers adjacent to the ballroom  created the main lobby and breezeway  and provided a larger food area called The Gardens  In 1973  an addition to the north was completed to create a food court  more space for the bookstore  and additional offices  Also  parts of the original building were remodeled to create the Campus Activities Center  an art gallery  and a ticket outlet  In 2000  the Wyoming Union underwent extensive renovation  The  12 million project moved the food court to the main level  expanded the bookstore to the lower level  and revitalized the look and feel of the interior  19  20   edit  Coe Library The original library at the University of Wyoming consisted of three hundred books and was located in Old Main  In 1923  the library was moved to the new Aven Nelson Memorial Building  With the 1950s came a larger student population and a greater push for America to excel academically  These factors contributed to the decision by the board of trustees that it was necessary to construct a new library  However  the 1951 state legislature rejected the funding request  The main entrance to Coe Library William Robertson Coe  a financier and philanthropist  came to the aid of president Humphrey in 1954 by contributing  750 000 in securities to the university  The trustees called the grant   one of the most outstanding contributions that has ever been made to the perpetuation of the American heritage  and ensured Coe that the building would be  appropriately named   21  The state legislature  in 1955  matched the Coe grant for an overall amount of  1 5 million  Laramie architects Eliot and Clinton Hitchcock  whose father had designed Aven Nelson  teamed up with the Porter and Porter firm in Cheyenne to design the new library  Their modular design was popular at the time and intended to make the space very functional  The layout provided room for over five hundred thousand books and seating for at least nine hundred students  In May 1956  one year after the death of Coe  ground was broken and construction began on the building  The William Robertson Coe library was finished in time for the Fall 1958 semester  22  In 1979 the stack tower was completed  This structure  designed by Kellogg and Kellogg of Cheyenne and Rock Springs  almost doubled the shelf space of the original Coe Library  The most recent renovation of the library was completed in the fall of 2009 and officially dedicated on November 19  2009  The new wing  referred to as Coe East  was designed by Hinthorne Mott Architects and adds 94 500 square feet  8 780 m2  to the library  23  The addition was part of a larger   50 million project to modernize the library by integrating technology and information  The renovation created an additional 20 group study rooms  space for 180 computer terminals and features art by James Surls  24  25   edit  Classroom Building The Classroom Building  dedicated in 1971 at a cost of  1 75 million  is designed to be a general purpose building for the university  The placement and unique design  by the local architects W  Eliot and Clinton A  Hitchcock  makes it the focal point of the George Duke Humphrey Science Center  The building also contains four interior mosaics  designed by UW art professors James Boyle  Joseph Deaderick  Richard Evans and Victor Flach  that represent the quadrant of Wyoming they face  Each mosaic is over 2 200 square feet  200 m2    The template below  Wide image  is being considered for merging  See templates for discussion to help reach a consensus    Panorama of George Duke Humphrey Science Center In 2007  after a two year  14 7 million renovation project  the classroom building reopened  The goal of the renovation was to incorporate new technology and redesign the seating to better meet the needs of students who carry laptops and backpacks  The building was also retrofitted with air conditioning  The unique characteristics of the original building  such as the circular design and mosaics were maintained  26   edit  Housing Washakie Dining Center and McIntyre Hall The University has six residence halls and three apartment
