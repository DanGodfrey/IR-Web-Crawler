American War was a conflict in 1898 between Spain and the United States  effectively the result of American intervention in the ongoing Cuban War of Independence  American attacks on Spain s Pacific possessions led to involvement in the Philippine Revolution and ultimately to the Philippine American War  7  Revolts against Spanish rule had been endemic for decades in Cuba and were closely watched by Americans  there had been war scares before  as in the Virginius Affair in 1873  By 1897 98  American public opinion grew angrier at reports of Spanish atrocities in Cuba  After the mysterious sinking of the American battleship Maine in Havana harbor  political pressures from the Democratic Party pushed the administration of President William McKinley  a Republican  into a war McKinley had wished to avoid  8  Compromise proved impossible  resulting in the United States sending an ultimatum to Spain demanding it immediately surrender control of Cuba  which the Spanish rejected  First Madrid  then Washington  formally declared war  9  Although the main issue was Cuban independence  the ten week war was fought in both the Caribbean and the Pacific  American naval power proved decisive  allowing U S  expeditionary forces to disembark in Cuba against a Spanish garrison already reeling from nation wide insurgent attacks and wasted by yellow fever  10  Cuban  Philippine  and American forces obtained the surrender of Santiago de Cuba and Manila owing to their numerical superiority in most of the battles and despite the good performance of some Spanish infantry units and spirited defenses in places like San Juan Hill  11  With two obsolete Spanish squadrons sunk in Santiago de Cuba and Manila Bay and a third  more modern fleet recalled home to protect the Spanish coasts  Madrid sued for peace  The result was the 1898 Treaty of Paris  negotiated on terms favorable to the U S   which allowed temporary American control of Cuba and  following their purchase from Spain  indefinite colonial authority over Puerto Rico  Guam  and the Philippines  The defeat and collapse of the Spanish Empire was a profound shock to Spain s national psyche and provoked a thoroughgoing philosophical and artistic reevaluation of Spanish society known as the Generation of  98  12  The victor gained several island possessions spanning the globe and a rancorous new debate over the wisdom of expansionism  13  Contents 1 Historical background 1 1 Spain s colonial retrenchment 1 2 American interest in Caribbean 2 The path to war 2 1 Cuban struggle for independence 2 2

loss of most of its colonies in the Americas in the early 19th century Spanish American wars of independence  and two disastrous Carlist wars effected a new interpretation of Spain s remaining empire  Liberal Spanish elites like Antonio C novas del Castillo and Emilio Castelar tried to redefine  empire  to dovetail with Spain s emerging nationalism  As C novas made clear in an address to the University of Madrid in 1882  14  15  the Spanish nation was a cultural and linguistic concept that tied Spain s colonies to the metropole despite the oceans that separated them  C novas argued Spain was markedly different from rival empires like Britain and France  Unlike these empires  spreading civilization was Spain s unique contribution to the New World  16  This popular reimagining of the Spanish Empire bestowed special significance on Cuba as an integral part of the Spanish nation  The focus on preserving the empire would have disastrous consequences for Spain s sense of national identity in the aftermath of the war   edit  American interest in Caribbean In 1823  U S  President James Monroe enunciated the Monroe Doctrine  which stated that the United States would not tolerate further efforts by European governments to colonize land or interfere with states in the Americas  however  Spain s colony in Cuba was exempted  In 1890  Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan wrote The Influence of Sea Power upon History  which credited the Royal Navy with bestowing great power status on Britain  Mahan s ideas on projecting strength through a strong navy had a powerful worldwide influence  among those strongly influenced by his conclusions was future President Theodore Roosevelt  who served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under President McKinley and was an aggressive supporter of a war with Spain over Cuba  Americans had long been interested in Cuba  since several U S  presidents  including James K  Polk  Franklin Pierce  and Ulysses S  Grant  had offered to purchase it from Spain  and others expressed their hopes of future annexation  17  However  there was still little attention paid to the Philippines  Guam  or Puerto Rico  18  Historians debate the extent to which Americans desired an empire and note that European powers had expanded their empires dramatically  particularly in Africa and Asia  19   edit  The path to war  edit  Cuban struggle for independence Main article  Cuban War of Independence The first serious bid for Cuban independence  the Ten Years War  erupted in 1868 and was suppressed by the Spanish colonial authorities a decade later  Neither the brutal fighting nor the reforms in the Pact of Zanj n  February 1878  quelled the desire of some revolutionaries for independence  One such revolutionary  Jos  Mart   continued to promote Cuban financial and political autonomy even in exile  In early 1895  after years of organizing  Mart  launched a three pronged invasion of the island  The plan called for one group from Santo Domingo led by M ximo G mez  one group from Costa Rica led by Antonio Maceo Grajales  and another from the United States  preemptively thwarted by U S  officials in Florida  to land in different places on the island and provoke a nationalist revolution  While their call for revolution  the grito de Ba re  was successful  the expected revolution was not the grand show of force Mart  had expected  With a quick victory effectively lost  the revolutionaries settled in to fight a protracted guerrilla campaign  20  Antonio C novas del Castillo  the architect of Spain s Restoration constitution and the prime minister at the time  ordered General Arsenio Mart nez Campos  a distinguished veteran of the war against the previous uprising in Cuba  to quell the revolt  Campos s reluctance to accept his new assignment and his method of containing the revolt to the province of Oriente earned him ridicule in the Spanish press  The mounting political pressure thus forced C novas to replace General Campos with General Valeriano Weyler y Nicolau  a soldier who had proved he could quash rebellions in the colonies and the Spanish metropole  Weyler deprived the insurgency of weaponry  supplies  and assistance by ordering the residents of some Cuban districts to move to reconcentration camps near the military headquarters  Although this strategy was brutally effective at slowing the spread of rebellion  it stirred indignation in the United States  21  McKinley remarked that this  was not civilized warfare  but  extermination   22   edit  Spanish attitude A Catalan satirical drawing published in La Campana de Gr cia  1896   criticizing U S  behavior regarding Cuba  The Spanish regarded Cuba as a province of Spain rather than a colony  for it had been an integral part of the country for almost four centuries  The island not only brought prestige to Spain  but it was also one of the most prosperous Spanish territories  just like it treated the rest of the Americas  The trade in the capital city  Havana  was comparable to that registered in Barcelona  then the most trade active city in Spain   To lose Cuba would mean an enormous disaster for the economy and political stability of the country  23  In fact  Spain had taken so much from the island that it would require several decades to recover economically from the shock  Spanish public opinion was inclined to avoid conflict  but American attitudes became more and more belligerent  taking advantage of Spain s weak position  and politicians were forced to respond firmly to the U S  threats  C novas del Castillo announced that  the Spanish nation is disposed to sacrifice to the last peseta of its treasure and to the last drop of blood of the last Spaniard before consenting that anyone snatch from it even one piece of its territory   24  However  the population was far from feeling the same   edit  U S  response The eruption of the Cuban revolt  Weyler s measures  and the popular fury these events whipped up proved to be a boon to the newspaper industry in New York City  where Joseph Pulitzer of the New York World and William Randolph Hearst of the New York Journal recognized the potential for great headlines and stories that would sell copies  Both papers covered Spain s actions and Weyler s tactics in a way that confirmed the popular disparaging attitude toward Spain in America  In the minds  schoolbooks  and scholarship of the mostly Protestant U S  public  the Catholic Spanish Empire was a backward  immoral union built on the backs of enslaved natives and funded with stolen gold  25  This indignation did not alone move the U S  closer to war  Seen from the West Coast of the United States  however  the view of the American Pacific differed  Nineteenth century American historiography was dominated by the notion of Manifest Destiny  the belief popularized by John O Sullivan that the United States was destined to  overspread and to possess the whole of the continent   26  The U S  had important economic interests that were being harmed by the prolonged conflict  Shipping firms that relied heavily on trade with Cuba suffered huge losses as the conflict continued unresolved  27  These firms pressed Congress and McKinley to seek an end to the revolt  Other U S  business concerns  specifically those who had invested in Cuban sugar  looked to the Spanish to restore order  28  Stability  not war  was the goal of both interests  How stability would be achieved would depend largely on the ability of Spain and the U S  to work out their issues diplomatically  President William McKinley  well aware of the political complexity surrounding the conflict  was predisposed to end the revolt peacefully  Threatening to consider recognizing Cuba s belligerent status  and thus allowing the legal rearming of Cuban insurgents by U S  firms  he sent Stewart L  Woodford to Madrid to negotiate an end to the conflict  With Pr xedes Sagasta  an open advocate of Cuban autonomy  now Prime Minister of Spain  the more hard line C novas del Castillo had been assassinated before Woodford arrived   negotiations went smoothly  Cuban autonomy was set to begin on January 1  1898  29   edit  USS Maine Main article  USS Maine  ACR 1  The sunken USS Maine Eleven days after the Cuban autonomous government took power  a small riot erupted in Havana  The riot was thought to be ignited by Spanish officers who were offended by the persistent newspaper criticism of General Valeriano Weyler s policies  30  McKinley sent the USS Maine to Havana to ensure the safety of American citizens and interests  The need for the U S  to send Maine to Havana had been expected for months  but the Spanish government was notified just 18 hours before its arrival  which was contrary to diplomatic convention  Preparations for the possible conflict started in October 1897  when President McKinley arranged for Maine to be deployed to Key West  Florida  30  as a part of a larger  global deployment of U S  naval power to attack simultaneously on several fronts if the war was not avoided  As Maine left Florida  a large part of the North Atlantic Squadron was moved to Key West and the Gulf of Mexico  Others were also moved just off the shore of Lisbon  and still others were moved to Hong Kong  31  At 9 40 pm on February 15  1898  Maine sank in Havana harbor after suffering a massive explosion  While McKinley preached patience  the news of the explosion and the death of 266 sailors stirred popular American opinion into demanding a swift belligerent response  McKinley asked Congress to appropriate  50 million for defense  and Congress unanimously obliged  Most American leaders took the position that the cause of the explosion was unknown  but public attention was now riveted on the situation and Spain could not find a diplomatic solution to avoid war  It appealed to the European powers  all of whom advised Spain to back down and avoid war  The U S  Navy s investigation  made public on March 28  concluded that the ship s powder magazines were ignited when an external explosion was set off under the ship s hull  This report poured fuel on popular indignation in the U S   making the war inevitable  32  Spain s investigation came to the opposite conclusion  the explosion originated within the ship  Other investigations in later years came to various contradictory conclusions  but had no bearing on the coming of the war  In 1974  Admiral Hyman George Rickover had his staff look at the documents and decided there was an internal explosion  A study commissioned by National Geographic magazine in 1999  using AME computer modelling  stated that the explosion could have been caused by a mine  but no definitive evidence was found  33   edit  Declaring war Main article  Propaganda of the Spanish American War United States Army officer Colonel Charles A  Wikoff was the most senior U S  military officer killed in the Spanish American War  After the Maine was destroyed  34  newspaper publishers Hearst and Pulitzer decided that the Spanish were to blame  and they publicized this theory as fact in their New York City papers using sensationalistic and astonishing accounts of  atrocities  committed by the Spanish in Cuba  Their press exaggerated what was happening and how the Spanish were treating the Cuban prisoners  35  The stories were based on truth but written with incendiary language causing emotional and often heated responses among readers  A common myth states  to the opinion of his illustrator Frederic Remington  that conditions in Cuba were not bad enough to warrant hostilities  Hearst responded   You furnish the pictures and I ll furnish the war   36  This new  yellow journalism  was  however  uncommon outside New York City  and historians no longer consider it the major force shaping the national mood  37  Public opinion nationwide did demand immediate action  overwhelming the efforts of President McKinley  Speaker of the House Thomas Brackett Reed  and the business community to find a negotiated solution  A speech delivered by Senator Redfield Proctor of Vermont on March 17  1898 thoroughly analyzed the situation  concluding that war was the only answer  The speech helped provide one final push for the United States to declare war  4  210 Many in the business and religious communities  which had  until then  opposed war  switched sides  leaving McKinley and Speaker Reed almost alone in their resistance to a war  38  On April 11  McKinley ended his resistance and asked Congress for authority to send American troops to Cuba to end the civil war there  knowing that Congress would force a war  On April 19  while Congress was considering joint resolutions supporting Cuban independence  Senator Henry M  Teller of Colorado proposed the Teller Amendment to ensure that the U S  would not establish permanent control over Cuba after the war  The amendment  disclaiming any intention to annex Cuba  passed the Senate 42 to 35  the House concurred the same day  311 to 6  The amended resolution demanded Spanish withdrawal and authorized the President to use as much military force as he thought necessary to help Cuba gain independence from Spain  President McKinley signed the joint resolution on April 20  1898  and the ultimatum was sent to Spain  In response  Spain broke off diplomatic relations with the United States on April 21  On the same day  the U S  Navy began a blockade of Cuba  39  Spain declared war on April 23  On April 25  Congress declared that a state of war between the U S  and Spain had existed since April 21  the day the blockade of Cuba had begun  39  The Navy was ready  but the Army was not well prepared for the war and made radical changes in plans and quickly purchased supplies  In the spring of 1898  the strength of the Regular U S  Army was just 28 000 men  The Army wanted 50 000 new men but received over 220 000  through volunteers and the mobilization of state National Guard units  40   edit  Pacific Theater  edit  Philippines Pacific Theatre The Spanish had first landed in the Philippines on March 17  1521  though colonization did not start until 1565  Since then  the islands had been a key holding for the Spanish Empire  In the 300 years of Spanish rule  the country developed from a small overseas colony governed from the Viceroyalty of New Spain to a modern partially autonomous country  with infrastructure  schools  hospitals and universities  The Spanish speaking middle classes of the 19th century were mostly educated in the liberal ideas coming from Europe  Among these Ilustrados was the Filipino national hero Jos  Rizal  who demanded larger reforms from the Spanish authorities  This movement eventually led to the Philippine Revolution against Spanish colonial rule  The revolution had been in a state of truce since the signing of the Pact of Biak na Bato in 1897  with revolutionary leaders having accepted exile outside of the country  Battle of Manila Bay The first battle between American and Spanish forces was at Manila Bay where  on 1 May  Commodore George Dewey  commanding the U S  Navy s Asiatic Squadron aboard USS Olympia  in a matter of hours defeated a Spanish squadron under Admiral Patricio Montojo  Dewey managed this with only nine wounded  41  42  With the German seizure of Tsingtao in 1897  Dewey s squadron had become the only naval force in the Far East without a local base of its own  and was beset with coal and ammunition problems  43  Despite these problems  the Asiatic Squadron not only destroyed the Spanish fleet but also captured the harbor of Manila  43  Following Dewey s victory  Manila Bay was filled with the warships of the United Kingdom  Germany  France  and Japan  all of which outgunned Dewey s force  43  The German fleet of eight ships  ostensibly in Philippine waters to protect German interests  acted provocatively   cutting in front of American ships  refusing to salute the United States flag  according to customs of naval courtesy   taking soundings of the harbor  and landing supplies for the besieged Spanish  45  The Germans  with interests of their own  were eager to take advantage of whatever opportunities the conflict in the islands might afford  The Americans called the bluff of the Germans  threatening conflict if the aggression continued  and the Germans backed down  46  47  At the time  the Germans expected the confrontation in the Philippines to end in an American defeat  with the revolutionaries capturing Manila and leaving the Philippines ripe for German picking  48  Commodore Dewey transported Emilio Aguinaldo  a Filipino leader who had led rebellion against Spanish rule in the Philippines in 1896  to the Philippines from exile in Hong Kong to rally more Filipinos against the Spanish colonial government  49  By June  U S  and Filipino forces had taken control of most of the islands  except for the walled city of Intramuros  On 12 June  Aguinaldo proclaimed the independence of the Philippines  50  51  On 13 August  with American commanders unaware that a cease fire had been signed between Spain and the U S  on the previous day  American forces captured the city of Manila from the Spanish  49  52  This battle marked the end of Filipino American collaboration  as the American action of preventing Filipino forces from entering the captured city of Manila was deeply resented by the Filipinos  This later led to the Philippine American War  53  which would prove to be more deadly and costly than the Spanish American War  The U S  had sent a force of some 11 000 ground troops to the Philippines  Armed conflict broke out between U S  forces and the Filipinos when U S  troops began to take the place of the Spanish in control of the country after the end of the war  resulting in the Philippine American War  On August 14  1899  the Schurman Commission recommended that the U S  retain control of the Philippines  possibly granting independence in the future  54   edit  Guam On 20 June  a U S  fleet commanded by Captain Henry Glass  consisting of the armored cruiser USS Charleston and three transports carrying troops to the Philippines  entered Guam s Apra Harbor  Captain Glass having opened sealed orders instructing him to proceed to Guam and capture it  Charleston fired a few cannon rounds at Fort Santa Cruz without receiving return fire  Two local officials  not knowing that war had been declared and believing the firing had been a salute  came out to Charleston to apologize for their inability to return the salute  Glass informed them that the U S  and Spain were at war  The following day  Glass sent Lt  William Braunersruehter to meet the Spanish Governor to arrange the surrender of the island and the Spanish garrison there  Some 54 Spanish infantry were captured and transported to the Philippines as prisoners of war  No U S  forces were left on Guam  but the only U S  citizen on the island  Frank Portusach  told Captain Glass that he would look after things until U S  forces returned  55   edit  Caribbean Theater  edit

24th and 25th Colored Infantry and Rescue of Rough Riders at San Juan Hill  July 2  1898 depicting the Battle of San Juan Hill  Theodore Roosevelt advocated intervention in Cuba  both for the Cuban people and to promote the Monroe Doctrine  While Assistant Secretary of the Navy  he placed the Navy on a war time footing and prepared Dewey s Asiatic Squadron for battle  He also worked with Leonard Wood in convincing the Army to raise an all volunteer regiment  the 1st U S  Volunteer Cavalry  Wood was given command of the regiment that quickly became known as the  Rough Riders   56  The Americans planned to capture the city of Santiago de Cuba to destroy Linares  army and Cervera s fleet  To reach Santiago they had to pass through concentrated Spanish defenses in the San Juan Hills and a small town in El Caney  The American forces were aided in Cuba by the pro independence rebels led by General Calixto Garc a   edit  Land campaign From 22 24 June  the U S  V Corps under General William R  Shafter landed at Daiquir  and Siboney  east of Santiago  and established an American base of operations  A contingent of Spanish troops  having fought a skirmish with the Americans near Siboney on 23 June  had retired to their lightly entrenched positions at Las Guasimas  An advance guard of U S  forces under former Confederate General Joseph Wheeler ignored Cuban scouting parties and orders to proceed with caution  They caught up with and engaged the Spanish rearguard commanded of about 2000 soldiers led by General Antonio Rubin 57  who effectively ambushed them  in the Battle of Las Guasimas on 24 June  The battle ended indecisively in favor of Spain and the Spanish left Las Guasimas on their planned retreat to Santiago  The U S  Army employed American Civil War era skirmishers at the head of the advancing columns  All four U S  soldiers who had volunteered to act as skirmishers walking point at the head of the American column were killed  including Hamilton Fish  from a well known patrician New York City family  and Captain Alyn Capron  whom Theodore Roosevelt would describe as one of the finest natural leaders and soldiers he ever met  The Battle of Las Guasimas showed the U S  that the old linear Civil War tactics did not work effectively against Spanish troops who had learned the art of cover and concealment from their own struggle with Cuban insurgents  and never made the error of revealing their positions while on the defense  Spanish troops were equipped with smokeless powder arms that also helped them to hide their positions while firing  Regular Spanish troops were mostly armed with modern charger loaded 1893 7mm Spanish Mauser rifles in using smokeless powder  while militia and irregular troops were armed with Remington Rolling Block rifles in  43 Spanish using smokeless powder and brass jacketed bullet  58  The high speed 7x57mm Mauser round was termed the  Spanish Hornet  by the Americans because of the supersonic crack as it passed overhead  In response  American troops using  30 40 Krag J rgensen and worse   45 70 Springfield single shot black powder rifles found themselves unable to respond with an equivalent volume of fire  American soldiers could advance against the Spaniards only in what are now called  fireteam  rushes  four to five man groups advancing while others laid down supporting fire from small arms  On 1 July  a combined force of about 15 000 American troops in regular infantry and cavalry regiments  including all four of the army s  Colored  regiments  and volunteer regiments  among them Roosevelt and his  Rough Riders   the 71st New York  the 2nd Massachusetts Infantry  and 1st North Carolina  and rebel Cuban forces attacked 1 270 entrenched Spaniards in dangerous Civil War style frontal assaults at the Battle of El Caney and Battle of San Juan Hill outside of Santiago  59  More than 200 U S  soldiers were killed and close to 1 200 wounded in the fighting  60  Supporting fire by Gatling guns was critical to the success of the assault  61  62  Cervera decided to escape Santiago two days later  The Spanish forces at Guant namo were so isolated by Marines and Cuban forces that they did not know that Santiago was under siege  and their forces in the northern part of the province could not break through Cuban lines  This was not true of the Escario relief column from Manzanillo  63  which fought its way past determined Cuban resistance but arrived too late to participate in the siege  After the battles of San Juan Hill and El Caney  the American advance halted  Spanish troops successfully defended Fort Canosa  allowing them to stabilize their line and bar the entry to Santiago  The Americans and Cubans forcibly began a bloody  strangling siege of the city  64  During the nights  Cuban troops dug successive series of  trenches   raised parapets   toward the Spanish positions  Once completed  these parapets were occupied by U S  soldiers and a new set of excavations went forward  American troops  while suffering daily losses from Spanish fire  suffered far more casualties from heat exhaustion and mosquito borne disease  65  At the western approaches to the city  Cuban general Calixto Garcia began to encroach on the city  causing much panic and fear of reprisals among the Spanish forces   edit  Naval operations The Santiago Campaign  1898  The major port of Santiago de Cuba was the main target of naval operations during the war  The U S  fleet attacking Santiago needed shelter from the summer hurricane season  Guant namo Bay  with its excellent harbor  was chosen  The 1898 invasion of Guant namo Bay happened between 6 and 10 June  with the first U S  naval attack and subsequent successful landing of U S  Marines with naval support  The Battle of Santiago de Cuba on 3 July  was the largest naval engagement of the Spanish American War and resulted in the destruction of the Spanish Caribbean Squadron  also known as the Flota de Ultramar   In May  the fleet of Spanish Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete had been spotted by American forces in Santiago harbor  where they had taken shelter for protection from sea attack  A two month stand off between Spanish and American naval forces followed  When the Spanish squadron finally attempted to leave the harbor on 3 July  the American forces destroyed or grounded five of the six ships  Only one Spanish vessel  the new armored cruiser Cristobal Colon  survived  but her captain hauled down her flag and scuttled her when the Americans finally caught up with her  The 1 612 Spanish sailors who were captured  including Admiral Cervera  were sent to Seavey s Island at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth  New Hampshire  where they were confined at Camp Long as prisoners of war from 11 July until mid September  During the stand off  U S  Assistant Naval Constructor Richmond Pearson Hobson had been ordered by Rear Admiral William T  Sampson to sink the collier USS Merrimac in the harbor to bottle up the Spanish fleet  The mission was a failure  and Hobson and his crew were captured  They were exchanged on 6 July  and Hobson became a national hero  he received the Medal of Honor in 1933 and became a Congressman   edit  U S  withdrawal Fiebre amarilla  yellow fever  had quickly spread amongst the American occupation force  crippling it  A group of concerned officers of the American army chose Theodore Roosevelt to draft a request to Washington that it withdraw the Army  a request that paralleled a similar one from General Shafter  who described his force as an  army of convalescents   By the time of his letter  75  of the force in Cuba was unfit for service  66  On August 7  the American invasion force started to leave Cuba  The evacuation was not total  The U S  Army kept the black Ninth Infantry Regiment in Cuba to support the occupation  The logic was that their race and the fact that many black volunteers came from southern states would protect them  this logic led to these soldiers being nicknamed  Immunes   Still  when the Ninth left  73 of its 984 soldiers had contracted the disease  66   edit  Puerto Rico Main article  Puerto Rican Campaign Puerto Rican and Spanish troops in Guayama  Puerto Rico In May 1898  Lt  Henry H  Whitney of the United States Fourth Artillery was sent to Puerto Rico on a reconnaissance mission  sponsored by the Army s Bureau of Military Intelligence  He provided maps and information on the Spanish military forces to the U S  government prior to the invasion  On May 10  U S  Navy warships were sighted off the coast of Puerto Rico  On May 12  a squadron of 12 U S  ships commanded by Rear Adm  William T  Sampson bombarded San Juan  During the bombardment  many government buildings were shelled  On June 25  the USS Yosemite blockaded San Juan harbor  On July 25  General Nelson A  Miles  with 3 300 soldiers  landed at Gu nica  beginning the Puerto Rican Campaign  The troops faced resistance early in the invasion  The first skirmish between the American and Spanish troops occurred in Gu nica  The first organized armed opposition occurred in Yauco in what became known as the Battle of Yauco  67  This encounter was followed by the Battles of Fajardo  Guayama  Guaman  River Bridge  Coamo  Silva Heights and finally by the Battle of Asomante  67  68  On August 9  1898  infantry and cavalry troops encountered Spanish and Puerto Rican soldiers armed with cannons in a mountain known as Cerro Gervasio del Asomante  while trying to enter Aibonito  68  The American commanders decided to retreat and regroup  returning on August 12  1898  with an artillery unit  68  The Spanish and Puerto Rican units began the offensive with cannon fire  being led by Ricardo Hern iz  The sudden attack caused confusion among some soldiers  who reported seeing a second Spanish unit nearby  68  In the cross fire  four American troops Sergeant John Long  Lieutenant Harris  Captain E T  Lee and Corporal Oscar Swanson were gravely injured  68  Based on this and the reports of upcoming reinforcements  Commander Landcaster ordered a retreat  68   edit  Making peace Jules Cambon  the French Ambassador in the U S   signing the memorandum of ratification on behalf of Spain With defeats in Cuba and the Philippines  and both of its fleets incapacitated  Spain sued for peace  Hostilities were halted on 12 August 1898  with the signing in Washington of a Protocol of Peace between the United States and Spain  69  After over two months of difficult negotiations  the formal peace treaty  the Treaty of Paris  was signed in Paris on December 10  1898  70  and was ratified by the United States Senate on February 6  1899  The United States gained almost all of Spain s colonies in the treaty  including the Philippines  Guam and Puerto Rico  70  The treaty came into force in Cuba April 11  1899  with Cubans participating only as observers  Having been occupied since July 17  1898  and thus under the jurisdiction of the United States Military Government  USMG   Cuba formed its own civil government and gained independence on May 20  1902  with the announced end of USMG jurisdiction over the island  However  the U S  imposed various restrictions on the new government  including prohibiting alliances with other countries  and reserved the right to intervene  The U S  also established a perpetual lease of Guant namo Bay   edit  Aftermath With the end of the war  Colonel Theodore Roosevelt musters out of the U S  Army after the required 30 day quarantine period at Montauk  Long Island  in 1898  The war lasted four months  John Hay  the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom   writing from London to his friend Theodore Roosevelt declared that it had been  a splendid little war   71  72  The press showed Northerners and Southerners  blacks and whites fighting against a common foe citation needed   helping to ease the scars left from the American Civil War  The war marked American entry into world affairs  Since then  the U S  has had a significant hand in various conflicts around the world  and entered many treaties and agreements  The Panic of 1893 was over by this point  and the U S  entered a long and prosperous period of economic and population growth  and technological innovation that lasted through the 1920s  73  The war redefined national identity  served as a solution of sorts to the social divisions plaguing the American mind  and provided a model for all future news reporting  74  The war also effectively ended the Spanish Empire  Spain had been declining as an imperial power since the early 19th century as a result of Napoleon s invasion  The loss of Cuba caused a national trauma because of the affinity of peninsular Spaniards with Cuba  which was seen as another province of Spain rather than as a colony  Spain retained only a handful of overseas holdings  Spanish West Africa  Spanish Guinea  Spanish Sahara  Spanish Morocco and the Canary Islands  The Spanish soldier Julio Cervera Baviera  who served in the Puerto Rican Campaign  published a pamphlet in which he blamed the natives of that colony for its occupation by the Americans  saying   I have never seen such a servile  ungrateful country  i e   Puerto Rico      In twenty four hours  the people of Puerto Rico went from being fervently Spanish to enthusiastically American     They humiliated themselves  giving in to the invader as the slave bows to the powerful lord   75  He was challenged to a duel by a group of young Puerto Ricans for writing this pamphlet  76  Culturally  a new wave called the Generation of  98 originated as a response to this trauma  marking a renaissance in Spanish culture  Economically  the war benefited Spain  because after the war large sums of capital held by Spaniards in Cuba and America were returned to the peninsula and invested in Spain  This massive flow of capital  equivalent to 25  of the gross domestic product of one year  helped to develop the large modern firms in Spain in the steel  chemical  financial  mechanical  textile  shipyard  and electrical power industries  77  However  the political consequences were serious  The defeat in the war began the weakening of the fragile political stability that had been established earlier by the rule of Alfonso XII  The cover of Puck from April 6  1901  Caricaturizes an Easter bonnet made out of a warship that alludes to the gains of the Spanish American War  Congress had passed the Teller Amendment prior to the war  promising Cuban independence  However  the Senate passed the Platt Amendment as a rider to an Army appropriations bill  forcing a peace treaty on Cuba which prohibited it from signing treaties with other nations or contracting a public debt  The Platt Amendment was pushed by imperialists who wanted to project U S  power abroad  this was in contrast to the Teller Amendment which was pushed by anti imperialists who called for a restraint on U S  rule   The amendment granted the United States the right to stabilize Cuba militarily as needed  The Platt Amendment also provided for a permanent American naval base in Cuba  Guant namo Bay was established after the signing of treaties between Cuba and the U S  beginning in 1903  The U S  annexed the former Spanish colonies of Puerto Rico  the Philippines and Guam  The notion of the United States as an imperial power  with colonies  was hotly debated domestically with President McKinley and the Pro Imperialists winning their way over vocal opposition led by Democrat William Jennings Bryan  who had supported the war  The American public largely supported the possession of colonies  but there were many outspoken critics such as Mark Twain  who wrote The War Prayer in protest  Roosevelt returned to the United States a war hero  and he was soon elected governor and then vice president  1900 Campaign poster The war served to further repair relations between the American North and South  The war gave both sides a common enemy for the first time since the end of the Civil War in 1865  and many friendships were formed between soldiers of northern and southern states during their tours of duty  This was an important development  since many soldiers in this war were the children of Civil War veterans on both sides  78  Segregation in the U S  military  1898 The African American community strongly supported the rebels in Cuba  supported entry into the war  and gained prestige from their wartime performance in the Army  Spokesmen noted that 33 African American seamen had died in the Maine explosion  The most influential Black leader  Booker T  Washington  argued that his race was ready to fight  War offered them a chance  to render service to our country that no other race can   because  unlike Whites  they were  accustomed  to the  peculiar and dangerous climate  of Cuba  One of the Black units that served in the war was the 9th Cavalry Regiment  In March 1898  Washington promised the Secretary of the Navy that war would be answered by  at least ten thousand loyal  brave  strong Black men in the south who crave an opportunity to show their loyalty to our land  and would gladly take this method of showing their gratitude for the lives laid down  and the sacrifices made  that Blacks might have their freedom and rights   79  In 1904  the United Spanish War Veterans was created from smaller groups of the veterans of the Spanish American War  Today  that organization is defunct  but it left an heir in the Sons of Spanish American War Veterans  created in 1937 at the 39th National Encampment of the United Spanish War Veterans  According to data from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs  the last surviving U S  veteran of the conflict  Nathan E  Cook  died on September 10  1992  at age 106   If the data is to be believed  Cook  born October 10  1885  would have been only 12 years old when he served in the war   The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States  VFW  was formed in 1914 from the merger of two prior veterans organizations which both arose in 1899  the American Veterans of Foreign Service and the National Society of the Army of the Philippines  80  The former was formed for veterans of the Spanish American War  while the latter was formed for veterans of the Philippine American War  Both organizations were formed in response to the general neglect veterans returning from the war experienced at the hands of the government  To pay the costs of the war  Congress passed an excise tax on long distance phone service  81  At the time  it affected only wealthy Americans who owned telephones  However  the Congress neglected to repeal the tax after the war ended four months later  and the tax remained in place for over 100 years until  on August 1  2006  it was announced that the U S  Department of the Treasury and the IRS would no longer collect the tax  82   edit  Spanish American War in film and television The Spanish American War was the first U S  war in which the motion picture camera played a role  83  The Library of Congress archives contain many films and film clips from the war  84  In addition  many feature films have been made about the war  These include The Rough Riders  a 1927 silent film Rough Riders  a 1997

states   In the larger view  the Cuban insurrection had already brought the Spanish army to the brink of defeat  During three years of relentless war  the Cubans had destroyed railroad lines  bridges  and roads and paralyzed telegraph communications  making it all but impossible for the Spanish army to move across the island and between provinces   The  Cubans had  moreover  inflicted countless thousands of casualties on Spanish soldiers and effectively driven Spanish units into beleaguered defensive concentrations in the cities  there to suffer the further debilitating effects of illness and hunger      Military Book Reviews   StrategyPage com  http   www strategypage com articles default asp target spaniard spaniard htm  Retrieved 2011 03 22     Dyal 1996  pp  108 109    George C
