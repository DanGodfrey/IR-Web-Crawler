Main article  History of the United States House of Representatives Under the Articles of Confederation  Congress was a unicameral body in which each state held one vote  After eight years of a more limited federal government under the Articles  numerous political leaders  such as James Madison and Alexander Hamilton  initiated the Constitutional Convention in 1787  which received the Confederation Congress s permission to  amend the Articles of Confederation   All states except Rhode Island agreed to send delegates  The issue of how Congress was to be structured was one of the most divisive among the founders during the Convention  Edmund Randolph s Virginia Plan called for a bicameral Congress  the lower house would be  of the people   elected directly by the people of the United States and representing public opinion  and a more deliberative upper house that would represent the individual states  and would be less susceptible to variations of mass sentiment  would be elected by the lower house  The House is referred to as the lower house  with the Senate being the upper house  although the United States Constitution does not use that terminology  Both houses  approval is necessary for the passage of legislation  The Virginia Plan drew the support of delegates from large states such as Virginia  Massachusetts  and Pennsylvania  as it called for representation based on population  The smaller states  however  favored the New Jersey Plan  which called for a unicameral Congress with equal representation for the states  Eventually  the Convention reached the Connecticut Compromise  or the Great Compromise  under which one house of Congress  the House of Representatives  would provide representation proportional to each state s population  whereas the other  the Senate  would provide equal representation amongst the states  The Constitution was ratified by the requisite number of states  nine out of the 13  in 1788  but its implementation was set for March 4  1789  The House began work on April 1  1789  when it achieved a quorum for the first time  During the first half of the 19th century  the House was frequently in conflict with the Senate over regionally divisive issues  including slavery  The North was much more populous than the South  and therefore dominated the House of Representatives  However  the North held no such advantage in the Senate  where the equal representation of states prevailed  Regional conflict was most pronounced over the issue of slavery  One example of a provision repeatedly supported by the House but blocked by the Senate was the Wilmot Proviso  which sought to ban slavery in the land gained during the Mexican American War  Conflict over slavery and other issues persisted until the Civil War  1861 1865   which began soon after several southern states attempted to secede from the Union  The war culminated in the South s defeat and in the abolition of slavery  Because all southern senators except Andrew Johnson resigned their seats at the beginning of the war  the Senate did not have the balance of power between North and South during the war  The years of Reconstruction that followed witnessed large majorities for the Republican Party  which many Americans associated with the Union s victory in the Civil War and the ending of slavery  The Reconstruction period ended in about 1877  the ensuing era  known as the Gilded Age  was marked by sharp political divisions in the electorate  The Democratic and the Republican Party held majorities in the House at various times  The late 19th and early 20th centuries also saw a dramatic increase in the power of the Speaker of the House  The rise of the Speaker s influence began in the 1890s  during tenure of Republican Thomas Brackett Reed   Czar Reed   as he was nicknamed  attempted to put into effect his view that  The best system is to have one party govern and the other party watch   The leadership structure of the House also developed during approximately the same period  with the positions of Majority Leader and Minority Leader being created in 1899  While the Minority Leader was the head of the minority party  the Majority Leader remained subordinate to the Speaker  The Speakership reached its zenith during the term of Republican Joseph Gurney Cannon  1903 to 1911  The powers of the Speaker included chairmanship of the influential Rules Committee and the ability to appoint members of other House committees  These powers  however  were curtailed in the  Revolution of 1910  because of the efforts of Democrats and dissatisfied Republicans who opposed Cannon s arguably heavy handed tactics  Republican Thomas Brackett Reed  occasionally ridiculed as  Czar Reed   was a U S  Representative from Maine  and Speaker of the House from 1889 1891 and from 1895 1899  The Democratic Party dominated the House of Representatives during the administration of President Franklin D  Roosevelt  1933 1945   often winning over two thirds of the seats  Both Democrats and Republicans were in power at various times during the next decade  The Democratic Party maintained control of the House from 1954 until 1995  In the mid 1970s  there were major reforms of the House  strengthening the power of sub committees at the expense of committee chairs and allowing party leaders to nominate committee chairs  These actions were taken to undermine the seniority system  and to reduce the ability of a small number of senior members to obstruct legislation they did not favor  There was also a shift from the 1970s to greater control of the legislative program by the majority party  the power of party leaders  especially the Speaker  grew considerably  The Republicans took control of the House in 1995  under the leadership of Speaker Newt Gingrich  Gingrich attempted to pass a major legislative program  the Contract with America on which the House Republicans had been elected  and made major reforms of the House  notably reducing the tenure of committee chairs to three two year terms  Many elements of the Contract did not pass Congress  were vetoed by President Bill Clinton  or were substantially altered in negotiations with Clinton  The Republicans held on to the House until the 2006 Congressional elections  during which the Democrats won control of the House of Representatives and Nancy Pelosi was subsequently elected by the House as the first female Speaker  In the 2010 House elections Republicans retook the House in the largest shift of power since the 1930s  3   edit  Membership  qualifications and apportionment  edit  Apportionment Further information  United States congressional apportionment Population per U S  Representative allocated to each of the 50 states and DC  ranked by population  Since DC  ranked 50  receives no seats in the House  its bar is absent  Under Article I  Section 2 of the Constitution  seats in the House of Representatives are apportioned among the states by population  as determined by the census conducted every ten years  Each state  however  is entitled to at least one Representative  The only constitutional rule relating to the size of the House says   The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand   4  Congress regularly increased the size of the House to account for population growth until it fixed the number of voting House members at 435 in 1911  1  The number was temporarily increased to 437 in 1959 upon the admission of Alaska and Hawaii  seating one representative from each of those states without changing existing apportionment   and returned to 435 four years later  after the reapportionment consequent to the 1960 census  The Constitution does not provide for the representation of the District of Columbia or of territories  The District of Columbia and the territories of American Samoa  Guam  the Northern Mariana Islands  and the U S  Virgin Islands are represented by one non voting delegate each  Puerto Rico elects a Resident Commissioner  but other than having a four year term  the Resident Commissioner s role is identical to the delegates from the other territories  The six Delegates and Resident Commissioner may participate in debates  prior to 2011  5  they were also allowed to vote in committees and the Committee of the Whole when their votes would not be decisive  6   edit  Redistricting States that are entitled to more than one Representative are divided into single member districts  This has been a federal statutory requirement since 1967  7  Prior to that law  general ticket representation was used by some states  Typically  states redraw these district lines  see redistricting  after each census  though they may do so at other times  see 2003 Texas redistricting   Each state determines its own district boundaries  either through legislation or through non partisan panels   Malapportionment  is unconstitutional and districts must be approximately equal in population  see Wesberry v  Sanders   The Voting Rights Act prohibits states from  gerrymandering  districts to reduce racial minorities  voting power   edit  Qualifications Article I  Section 2 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for representatives  Each representative must   1  be at least twenty five years old   2  have been a citizen of the United States for the past seven years  and  3  be  at the time of the election  an inhabitant of the state they represent  Members are not required to live in the district they represent  but they traditionally do  The age and citizenship qualifications for representatives are less than those for senators  The constitutional requirements of Article I  Section 2 for election to Congress are the maximum requirements that can be imposed on a candidate  8  Therefore  Article I  Section 5  which permits each House to be the judge of the qualifications of its own members does not permit either House to establish additional qualifications  Likewise a State could not establish additional qualifications  Disqualification  under the Fourteenth Amendment  a federal or state officer who takes the requisite oath to support the Constitution  but later engages in rebellion or aids the enemies of the United States  is disqualified from becoming a representative  This post Civil War provision was intended to prevent those who sided with the Confederacy from serving  However  disqualified individuals may serve if they gain the consent of two thirds of both houses of Congress   edit  Elections Elections for representatives are held in every even numbered year  on Election Day the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November  By law Representatives must be elected from single member districts by plurality voting  In most states  major party candidates for each district are nominated in partisan primary elections  typically held in spring to late summer  In some states  the Republican and Democratic parties choose their respective candidates for each district in their political conventions in spring or early summer  which often use unanimous voice votes to reflect either confidence in the incumbent or the result of bargaining in earlier private discussions  Exceptions can result in so called floor fight convention votes by delegates  with outcomes that can be hard to predict  Especially if a convention is closely divided  a losing candidate may contend further by meeting the conditions for a primary election  The courts generally do not consider ballot access rules for independent and third party candidates to be additional qualifications for holding office and there are no federal regulations regarding ballot access  As a result  the process to gain ballot access varies greatly from state to state  and  in the case of a third party may be affected by results of previous years  elections  Since 1967  Federal law has required that House Members be elected from single member districts  thereby not permitting the use of proportional representation  9 Louisiana is unique in that it holds an all party  primary election  on the general Election Day with a subsequent runoff election between the top two finishers  regardless of party  if no candidate received a majority in the primary  The state of Washington now uses a similar  though not identical  system to that used by Louisiana  Seats vacated during a term are filled through special elections  unless the vacancy occurs closer to the next general election date than a pre established deadline  The term of a member chosen in a special election usually begins the next day  or as soon as the results are certified   edit  Terms Representatives and Delegates serve for two year terms  while the Resident Commissioner serves for four years  The Constitution permits the House to expel a member with a two thirds vote  In the history of the United States  only five members have been expelled from the House  in 1861  three were removed for supporting the Confederate states  secession  John Bullock Clark  D MO   John William Reid  D MO   and Henry Cornelius Burnett  D KY   Michael Myers  D PA  was expelled after his criminal conviction for accepting bribes in 1980  and James Traficant  D OH  was expelled in 2002 following his conviction for corruption  10  The House also has the power to formally censure or reprimand its members  censure or reprimand requires only a simple majority  but does not remove a member from office   edit  Comparison to the Senate As a check on the popularly elected House  the Senate has several distinct powers  For example  the  advice and consent  powers  such as the power to approve treaties  is a sole Senate privilege  11  The House  however  can initiate spending bills and has exclusive authority to impeach officials and choose the President in an Electoral College deadlock  12  The Senate and House are further differentiated by term lengths and the number of districts represented  With longer terms  fewer members and  in all but seven delegations  larger constituencies  senators may receive greater prestige  Additionally  the Senate has traditionally been considered a less partisan chamber because fewer members gives the Senate a greater potential to broker compromises and act more unilaterally  citation needed   edit  Salary and benefits  edit  Salaries As of January 2010 update   the annual salary of each Representative is  174 000  13  The Speaker of the House and the Majority and Minority Leaders earn more   223 500 for the Speaker and  193 400 for their party leaders  the same as Senate leaders   A cost of living adjustment  COLA  increase takes effect annually unless Congress votes to not accept it  Congress sets members  salaries  however  the Twenty seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits a change in salary  but not COLA 14   from taking effect until after the next general election  Representatives are eligible for retirement benefits after serving for five years  15   edit  Titles Representatives use the prefix  The Honorable  before their names  A member of the House is referred to as a  Representative    Congressman   or  Congresswoman   While Senators are technically  Congressmen  or  Congresswomen   that term is generally used to refer to Members of the House of Representatives exclusively  The Delegates and the Resident Commissioner use those titles or  Congressman Congresswoman    edit  Officers  edit  Member officials The party with a majority of seats in the House is known as the majority party  The next largest party is the minority party  The Speaker  committee chairs  and some other officials are generally from the majority party  they have counterparts  for instance  the  ranking members  of committees  in the minority party  Then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  Majority Leader Steny Hoyer  and Education and Labor Committee Chairman George Miller confer with President Barack Obama at the Oval Office in 2009  The Constitution provides that the House may choose its own Speaker  16  Although not explicitly required by the Constitution  every Speaker has been a member of the House  The Constitution does not specify the duties and powers of the Speaker  which are instead regulated by the rules and customs of the House  Speakers have a role both as a leader of the House and the leader of their party  which need not be the majority party  theoretically  a member of the minority party could be elected as Speaker with the support of a fraction of members of the majority party   Under the Presidential Succession Act  1947   the Speaker is second in the line of presidential succession behind the Vice President  The Speaker is the presiding officer of the House but does not preside over every debate  Instead  he or she delegates the responsibility of presiding to other members in most cases  The presiding officer sits in a chair in the front of the House chamber  The powers of the presiding officer are extensive  one important power is that of controlling the order in which members of the House speak  No member may make a speech or a motion unless he or she has first been recognized by the presiding officer  Moreover  the presiding officer may rule on a  point of order   a member s objection that a rule has been breached   the decision is subject to appeal to the whole House  Speakers serve as chairs of their party s steering committee  which is responsible for assigning party members to other House committees  The Speaker chooses the chairs of standing committees  appoints most of the members of the Rules Committee  appoints all members of conference committees  and determines which committees consider bills  Each party elects a floor leader  who is known as the Majority Leader or Minority Leader  The Minority Leader heads his or her party in the House  and the Majority Leader is his or her party s second highest ranking official  behind the Speaker  Party leaders decide what legislation members of their party should either support or oppose  Each party also elects a whip  who works to ensure that the party s members vote as the party leadership desires  The current majority whip in the House of Representatives is Kevin McCarthy  who is a member of the Republican Party  The current minority whip is Steny Hoyer  who is a member of the Democratic Party  The whip is supported by chief deputy whips  In the 112th Congress  the Democratic Party has an additional Assistant Minority Leader  Jim Clyburn  who ranks between the whips and the caucus conference chair  After the whips  the next ranking official in the House party s leadership is the Party Conference Chair  styled as the Republican Conference Chair and Democratic Caucus Chair   After the Conference Chair  there are differences between each party s subsequent leadership ranks  After the Democratic Caucus Chair is the Campaign Committee Chair  Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee   then the co chairs of the Steering Committee  For the Republicans it is the Chair of the House Republican Policy Committee  followed by the Campaign Committee Chairman  styled as the National Republican Congressional Committee   The chairs of House committees  particularly influential standing committees such as Appropriations  Ways and Means  and Rules  are powerful but not officially part of House leadership hierarchy  Until the post of Majority Leader was created  the Chair of Ways and Means was the de facto majority leader   edit  Leadership and partisanship Representatives are generally less independent of party leaders than senators  and usually vote as the leadership directs  Incentives to cooperate include the leadership s power to select committee chairs  determine committee assignments  and provide re election support in the primary and general elections  As a result  the leadership plays a much greater role in the House than in the Senate  an example of why the atmosphere of the House is regarded by many as more partisan  When the Presidency and Senate are controlled by a different party from the one controlling the House  the Speaker can become the de facto  leader of the opposition   Since the Speaker is a partisan officer with substantial power to control the business of the House  the position is often used for partisan advantage  In the instance when the Presidency and both Houses of Congress are controlled by one party  the Speaker normally takes a low profile and defers to the President  For that situation the House Minority Leader can play the role of a de facto  leader of the opposition   often more so than the Senate Minority Leader  due to the more partisan nature of the House and the greater role of leadership   edit  Non member officials The House is also served by several officials who are not members  The House s chief officer is the Clerk  who maintains public records  prepares documents  and oversees junior officials  including pages  The Clerk also presides over the House at the beginning of each new Congress pending the election of a Speaker  Another officer is the Chief Administrative Officer  responsible for the day to day administrative support to the House of Representatives  This includes everything from payroll to foodservice  The position of Chief Administrative Officer  CAO  was created by the 104th Congress following the 1994 mid term elections  replacing the positions of Doorkeeper and Director of Non Legislative and Financial Services  created by the previous congress to administer the non partisan functions of the House   The CAO also assumed some of the responsibilities of the House Information Services  which previously had been controlled directly by the Committee on House Administration  then headed by Representative Charlie Rose of North Carolina  along with the House  Folding Room   The Chaplain leads the House in prayer at the opening of the day  There is also a Sergeant at Arms  who as the House s chief law enforcement officer maintains order and security on House premises  Finally  routine police work is handled by the United States Capitol Police  which is supervised by the Capitol Police Board  a body to which the Sergeant at Arms belongs   edit  Procedure Main article  Procedures of the United States House of Representatives  edit  Daily procedures This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Like the Senate  the House of Representatives meets in the United States Capitol in Washington  D C  At one end of the chamber of the House is a rostrum from which the Speaker presides  The lower tier of the rostrum is used by clerks and other officials  Members  seats are arranged in the chamber in a semicircular pattern and are divided by a wide central aisle  By tradition  Democrats sit on the left of the center aisle  while Republicans sit on the right  as viewed from the presiding officer s chair  Sittings are normally held on weekdays  meetings on Saturdays and Sundays are rare  Sittings of the House are generally open to the public  visitors must obtain a House Gallery pass from a congressional office  Sittings are broadcast live on television and streamed online by C SPAN  The procedure of the House depends not only on the rules  but also on a variety of customs  precedents  and traditions  In many cases  the House waives some of its stricter rules  including time limits on debates  by unanimous consent  A member may block a unanimous consent agreement  in practice  objections are rare  The presiding officer enforces the rules of the House  and may warn members who deviate from them  The presiding officer uses a gavel to maintain order  The box in which legislation is placed to be considered by the House is called the hopper  In one of its first resolutions  the U S  House of Representatives established the Office of the Sergeant at Arms  In an American tradition adopted from English custom in 1789 by the first Speaker of the House  Frederick Muhlenberg of Pennsylvania  the House of Representatives mace is used to open all sessions of the House  It is also used during the inaugural ceremonies for all Presidents of the United States  For daily sessions of the House  the sergeant at Arms carries the mace in front of the Speaker in procession to the rostrum  It is placed on a green marble pedestal to the Speaker s right  When the House is in committee  the mace is moved to a pedestal next to the desk of the Sergeant at Arms  The Constitution provides that a majority of the House constitutes a quorum to do business  Under the rules and customs of the House  a quorum is always assumed present unless a quorum call explicitly demonstrates otherwise  House rules prevent a member from making a point of order that a quorum is not present unless a question is being voted upon  the presiding officer will not accept a point of order of no quorum during general debate or when a question is not before the House  During debates  a member may only speak if called upon by the presiding officer  The presiding officer may determine which members to recognize  and may therefore control the course of debate  All speeches must be addressed to the presiding officer  using the words  Mr  Speaker  or  Madam Speaker   Only the presiding officer may be directly addressed in speeches  other members must be referred to in the third person  In most cases  members do not refer to each other by name  but by state  using forms such as  the gentleman from Virginia    the distinguished gentlewoman from California   or  my distinguished friend from Alabama   Unlike the practice in the Parliament of the United Kingdom  members refer to each other as friends regardless of whether they are members of the same party  There are 448 permanent seats on the House Floor and four tables  two on each side  These tables are occupied by members of the committee that have brought a bill to the floor for consideration and by the respective party leadership  Members address the House from microphones at any table or  the well   the area immediately in front of the rostrum  17   edit  Passage of legislation Per the constitution  the House determines the rules according to which it passes legislation  The rules are in principle open to change with each new Congress  but in practice each new session amends a standing set of rules built up over the history of the body in an early resolution published for public inspection  18  Before legislation reaches the floor of the House  the Rules Committee normally passes a rule to govern debate on that measure  For instance  the committee determines if amendments to the bill are permitted  An  open rule  permits all germane amendments  but a  closed rule  restricts or even prohibits amendment  Debate on a bill is generally restricted to one hour  equally divided between the majority and minority parties  Each side is led during the debate by a  floor manager   who allocates debate time to members who wish to speak  On contentious matters  many members may wish to speak  thus  a member may receive as little as one minute  or even thirty seconds  to make his her point  When debate concludes  the motion in question is put to a vote  In many cases  the House votes by voice vote  the presiding officer puts the question  and members respond either  yea   in favor of the motion  or  nay   against the motion   The presiding officer then announces the result of the voice vote  A member may however challenge the presiding officer s assessment and  request the yeas and nays  or  request a recorded vote   The request may be granted only if it is seconded by one fifth of the members present  In practice  however  members of congress second requests for recorded votes as a matter of courtesy  Some votes are always recorded  such as those on the annual budget  The House may vote in three manners  First  the House may vote by electronic device  members use a personal identification card to record their votes at one of 46 voting stations in the chamber  Votes are usually held by electronic device  Secondly  the House may conduct a teller vote  Members hand in colored cards to indicate their votes  green for  yea   red for  nay   and orange for  present   i e   to abstain   Teller votes are normally held only when the computer system breaks down  Finally  the House may conduct a roll call vote  The Clerk reads the list of members of the House  each of whom announces their vote when their name is called  This procedure is reserved for formal votes  such as the election of a Speaker  because of the time consumed by calling over four hundred names  Voting traditionally lasts for fifteen minutes  but it may be extended if the leadership needs to  whip  more members into alignment  The 2003 vote on the prescription drug benefit was open for three hours  from 3 00 to 6 00 a m   to receive four additional votes  three of which were necessary to pass the legislation  The 2005 vote on the Central American Free Trade Agreement was open for one hour  from 11 00 p m  to midnight  An October 2005 vote on facilitating refinery construction was kept open for forty minutes  Presiding officers may vote like other members  They may not  however  vote twice in the event of a tie  Instead  motions are decided in the negative when ties arise   edit  Committees Main articles  United States congressional committee and List of United States House of Representatives committees The House uses committees and their subcommittees for a variety of purposes  including the review of bills and the oversight of the executive branch  The appointment of committee members is formally made by the whole House  but the choice of members is actually made by the political parties  Generally  each party honors the preferences of individual members  giving priority on the basis of seniority  Historically  membership on committees has been in rough proportion to the party s strength in the House as a whole  with two exceptions  on the Rules Committee  the majority party fills nine of the thirteen seats  19  and on the Ethics Committee  each party has an equal number of seats  20  However  when party control in the House is closely divided  extra seats on committees are sometimes allocated to the majority party  In the 109th Congress  for example  the Republicans controlled about 53  of the House as a whole  but had 54  of the Appropriations Committee members  55  of the members on the Energy and Commerce Committee  58  of the members on the Judiciary Committee  and 69  of the members on the Rules Committee   The largest committee of the House is the Committee of the Whole  which  as its name suggests  consists of all members of the House  The Committee meets in the House chamber  it may consider and amend bills  but may not grant them final passage  Generally  the debate procedures of the Committee of the Whole are more flexible than those of the House itself  One advantage of the Committee of the Whole is its ability to include otherwise non voting members of Congress  Most committee work is performed by twenty standing committees  each of which has jurisdiction over a specific set of issues  such as Agriculture or Foreign Affairs  Each standing committee considers  amends  and reports bills that fall under its jurisdiction  Committees have extensive powers with regard to bills  they may block legislation from reaching the floor of the House  Standing committees also oversee the departments and agencies of the executive branch  In discharging their duties  standing committees have the power to hold hearings and to subpoena witnesses and evidence  The House also has one permanent committee that is not a standing committee  the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence  and from time to time may establish committees that are temporary and advisory in nature  such as the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming  This latter committee  created in the 110th Congress and reauthorized for the 111th  has no jurisdiction over legislation and must be chartered anew at the start of every Congress  The House also appoints members to serve on joint committees  which include members of the Senate and House  Some joint committees oversee independent government bodies  for instance  the Joint Committee on the Library oversees the Library of Congress  Other joint committees serve to make advisory reports  for example  there exists a Joint Committee on Taxation  Bills and nominees are not referred to joint committees  Hence  the power of joint committees is considerably lower than those of standing committees  Each House committee and subcommittee is led by a chairman  always a member of the majority party   From 1910 to the 1970s  committee chairs were powerful  Woodrow Wilson in his classic study  21  suggested  Power is nowhere concentrated  it is rather deliberately and of set policy scattered amongst many small chiefs  It is divided up  as it were  into forty seven seigniories  in each of which a Standing Committee is the court baron and its chairman lord proprietor  These petty barons  some of them not a little powerful  but none of them within the reach of the full powers of rule  may at will exercise almost despotic sway within their own shires  and may sometimes threaten to convulse even the realm itself  From 1910 to 1975 committee and subcommittee chairmanship was determined purely by seniority  congressmembers sometimes had to wait 30 years to get one  but their chairship was independent of party leadership  The rules were changed in 1975 to permit party caucuses to elect chairs  shifting power upward to the party leaders  In 1995  Republicans under Newt Gingrich set a limit of three two year terms for committee chairs  The Democrats who took over in 2007 have not decided whether to continue the Gingrich rules  The chair s powers are extensive  they control the committee subcommittee agenda  and may prevent the committee from dealing with a bill  The senior member of the minority party is known as the Ranking Member  In some committees like Appropriations  partisan disputes are few   edit  Legislative functions Most bills may be introduced in either House of Congress  However  the Constitution provides that  All bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives   As a result  the Senate cannot initiate bills imposing taxes  Furthermore  the House of Representatives holds that the Senate cannot originate appropriation bills  or bills authorizing the expenditure of federal funds  Historically  the Senate has disputed the interpretation advocated by the House  However  when the Senate originates an appropriations bill  the House simply refuses to consider it  thereby settling the dispute in practice  The constitutional provision barring the Senate from introducing revenue bills is based on the practice of the British Parliament  in which only the House of Commons may originate such measures  Although it cannot originate revenue bills  the Senate retains the power to amend or reject them  As Woodrow Wilson wrote   T he Senate s right to amend  revenue bills  has been allowed the widest possible scope  The upper house may add to them what it pleases  may go altogether outside of their original provisions and tack to them entirely new features of legislation  altering not only the amounts but even the objects of expenditure  and making out of the materials sent them by the popular chamber measures of an almost totally new character  The approval of the Senate and the House of Representatives is required for a bill to become law  Both Houses must pass the same version of the bill  if there are differences  they may be resolved by a conference committee  which includes members of both bodies  For the stages through which bills pass in the Senate  see Act of Congress  The President may veto a bill passed by the House and Senate  If he does  the bill does not become law unless a two thirds supermajority in each chamber votes to override the veto   edit  Checks and balances The Constitution provides that the Senate s  advice and consent  is necessary for the President to make appointments and to ratify treaties  while the House must confirm the nomination of a new Vice President under the 25th Amendment  Thus  with its potential to frustrate Presidential appointments  the Senate is more powerful than the House  The Constitution empowers the House of Representatives to impeach federal officials for  Treason  Bribery  or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors  and empowers the Senate to try such impeachments  The House may approve  articles of impeachment  by a simple majority vote  however  a two thirds vote is required for conviction in the Senate  A convicted official is automatically removed from office  in addition  the Senate may stipulate that the defendant be banned from holding future office  No further punishment is permitted during the impeachment proceedings  however  the party may face criminal penalties in a normal court of law  In the history of the United States  the House of Representatives has impeached sixteen officials  of whom seven were convicted   Another  Richard Nixon  resigned after the House Judiciary Committee passed articles of impeachment but before a formal impeachment vote by the full House   Only two Presidents of the United States have ever been impeached  Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998  Both trials ended in acquittal  in Johnson s case  the Senate fell one vote short of the two thirds majority required for conviction  Under the Twelfth Amendment  the House has the power to elect the President if no presidential candidate receives a majority of votes in the Electoral College  The Twelfth Amendment requires the House to choose from the three candidates with the highest numbers of electoral votes  The Constitution provides that  the votes shall be taken by states  the representation from each state having one vote   Electoral College deadlocks are rare  in the history of the United States  the House has only had to break a deadlock twice  In 1800  it elected Thomas Jefferson over Aaron Burr  in 1824  it elected John Quincy Adams over Andrew Jackson and William H  Crawford  The Senate elects the Vice President if the Electoral College deadlocks   edit  Latest election results and current party standings Main articles  United States House of Representatives elections  2010  Members of the 112th
