congressional passage of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967  This act was signed into law by President Lyndon B  Johnson  and established the Corporation for Public Broadcasting  which also created the Public Broadcasting Service in addition to NPR  A CPB organizing committee under John Witherspoon first created a Board of Directors chaired by Bernard Mayes  1970s logo  The board then hired Donald Quayle to be the first president of NPR with 30 employees and 90 charter member stations  and studios in Washington D C   6  NPR aired its first broadcast in April 1971  covering United States Senate hearings on the Vietnam War  A month later  the afternoon drive time newscast All Things Considered began  on May 3  1971  first hosted by Robert Conley  NPR was primarily a production and distribution organization until 1977  when it merged with the Association of Public Radio Stations  As a membership organization  NPR was then charged with providing stations with training  program promotion  and management  and with representing the interests of public radio before Congress and providing content delivery mechanisms  such as satellite transmission  citation needed   edit  1980s NPR suffered an almost fatal setback in 1983 when efforts to expand services created a deficit of nearly US 7 million  After a Congressional investigation and the resignation of NPR s president  Frank Mankiewicz  the Corporation for Public Broadcasting agreed to lend the network money in order to stave off bankruptcy  7  In exchange  NPR agreed to a new arrangement whereby the annual CPB stipend that it had previously received directly would be divided among local stations instead  in turn  those stations would support NPR productions on a subscription basis  NPR also agreed to turn its satellite service into a cooperative venture  the Public Radio Satellite System   making it possible for non NPR shows to get national distribution  It took NPR approximately three years to pay off the debt  8  Logo used during 1990s   edit  1990s Delano Lewis  the president of C amp P Telephone  left that position to become NPR s CEO and president in January 1994  9  Lewis resigned in August 1998  9  10  In November 1998  NPR s board of directors hired Kevin Klose  the director of the International Broadcasting Bureau  as its president and chief executive officer  10   edit  2000s   September 11th made it apparent in a very urgent way that we need another facility that could keep NPR going if something devastating happens in Washington     Jay Kernis  NPR s senior VP for programming 11  In November 2002  NPR spent nearly  13 million to acquire and equip a West Coast 25 000 square foot  2 300 m2  production facility  dubbed  NPR West   which opened in Culver City  California  it had room to for up to 90 employees  and was established to expand its production capabilities  improve its coverage of the western United States  and create a backup production facility capable of keeping NPR on the air in the event of a catastrophe in Washington  11  On November 6  2003  NPR was given US 235 million 12  from the estate of the late Joan B  Kroc  the widow of Ray Kroc  founder of McDonald s Corporation  This was the largest monetary gift ever to a cultural institution  13  14  In 2004 NPR s budget increased by over 50  to US 153 million due to the Kroc gift  US 34 million of the money was deposited in its endowment  15  The endowment fund before the gift totaled  35 million  NPR will use the interest from the bequest to expand its news staff and reduce some member stations  fees  13  The 2005 budget was about US 120 million  Ken Stern became chief executive in September 2006  reportedly as the  hand picked successor  of CEO Kevin Klose  who gave up the job but remained as NPR s president  Stern had worked with Klose at Radio Free Europe  12  On December 10  2008  NPR announced that it would reduce its workforce by 7  and cancel the news programs Day to Day and News  amp  Notes  16  The organization indicated this was in response to a rapid drop in corporate underwriting in the wake of the economic crisis of 2008  16  In the fall of 2008  NPR programming reached a record 27 5 million people weekly  according to Arbitron ratings figures  NPR stations reach 32 7 million listeners overall  17  In March 2008  the NPR Board announced that Stern would be stepping down from his role as Chief Executive Officer  following conflict with NPR s Board of Directors  over the direction of the organization   including issues NPR s member station managers had had with NPR s expansion into new media  at the expense of serving  the stations that financially support NPR  12  As of 2009  corporate sponsorship made up 26  of the NPR budget  18   edit  2010s In July 2010  the former National Public Radio quietly renamed itself NPR  No formal announcement was issued  but affiliated stations and staff were instructed to use only the initials  1  In October 2010  NPR accepted a  1 8 million grant from the Open Society Institute  The grant is meant to begin a project called Impact of Government that is intended to add at least 100 journalists at NPR member radio stations in all 50 states over the next three years  19  The OSI has made previous donations  but does not take on air credit for its gifts  20   edit  Governance NPR headquarters at 635 Massachusetts Avenue NW in Washington  D C  NPR is a membership corporation  Member stations are required to be non commercial or non commercial educational radio stations  have at least five full time professional employees  operate for at least 18 hours per day  and not be designed solely to further a Religious broadcasting philosophy or be used for classroom Distance learning programming  Each member station receives one vote at the annual NPR board meetings exercised by its designated Authorized Station Representative   A Rep    To oversee the day to day operations and prepare its budget  members elect a Board of Directors  This board is composed of ten A Reps  five members of the general public  and the chair of the NPR Foundation  Terms are for three years and rotate such that some stand for election every year  21  The original purposes of NPR  as ratified by the Board of Directors  are the following  Provide an identifiable daily product which is consistent and reflects the highest standards of broadcast journalism  Provide extended coverage of public events  issues and ideas  and to acquire and produce special public affairs programs  Acquire and produce cultural programs which can be scheduled individually by stations  Provide access to the intellectual and cultural resources of cities  universities and rural districts through a system of cooperative program development with member public radio stations  Develop and distribute programs for specific groups  Adult education  instruction  modular units for local productions  which may meet needs of individual regions or groups  but may not have general national relevance  Establish liaison with foreign broadcasters for a program exchange service  Produce materials specifically intended to develop the art and technical potential of radio  22  As of December 2010 update   the Board of Directors of NPR included the following members  NPR Member Station Managers Dave Edwards

University  edit  Funding In 2010  NPR revenues totaled  180 million  with the bulk of revenues coming from programming fees  grants from foundations or business entities  contributions and sponsorships  18  According to the 2009 financial statement  about 50  of NPR revenues come from the fees it charges member stations for programming and distribution charges  18  Typically  NPR member stations receive funds through on air pledge drives  corporate underwriting  state and local governments  educational institutions  and the federally funded Corporation for Public Broadcasting  CPB   In 2009  member stations derived 6  of their revenue from federal  state and local government funding  10  of their revenue from CPB grants  and 14  of their revenue from universities  18  23  While NPR does not receive any direct federal funding  it does receive a small number of competitive grants from CPB and federal agencies like the Department of Education and the Department of Commerce  This funding amounts to approximately 2  of NPR s overall revenues  18  During the 1970s and early 1980s  the majority of NPR funding came from the federal government  Steps were taken during the 1980s to completely wean NPR from government support  but the 1983 funding crisis forced the network to make immediate changes  Now more money to fund the NPR network is raised from listeners  charitable foundations and corporations instead  citation needed  According to CPB  in 2009 11 3  of the aggregate revenues of all public radio broadcasting stations were funded from federal sources  principally through CPB  24   edit  Underwriting spots vs  commercials In contrast with commercial broadcasting  NPR does not carry traditional radio commercials  but has advertising in the form of brief statements from major donors  These statements are called underwriting spots and  unlike commercials  are governed by specific FCC restrictions in addition to truth in advertising laws  they cannot advocate a product or contain any  call to action    edit  Listenership According to a 2003 Washington Monthly story  about 20 million listeners tune into NPR each week  The average listener is 50 years old  25  and earns an annual income of US 78 000  As of 2006  NPR s listenership is 80  white and 20  non white  26  While Arbitron tracks public radio listenership  they do not include public radio in their published rankings of radio stations  NPR stations generally do not subscribe to the Arbitron rating service  and are not included in published ratings and rankings such as Radio  amp  Records  However  NPR station listenership is measured by Arbitron in both Diary and PPM  people meter  markets  NPR stations are frequently not included in  summary level  diary data used by most advertising agencies for media planning  Data on NPR listening can be accessed using  respondent level  diary data  Additionally  all radio stations  public and commercial  are treated equally within the PPM data sets making NPR station listenership data much more widely available to the media planning community  According to Artitron s National Broadcast Audience Estimate report for September 29  2011  27  NPR s signature morning news program   Morning Edition   is the network s most popular program  drawing 12 9 million listeners a week  with its afternoon newsmagazine   All Things Considered   a close second  with 12 2 million listeners a week  Arbitron data is also provided by Radio Research Consortium  a non profit corporation which subscribes to the Aribtron service and distributes the data to NPR and other non commercial stations and on its website  28  In a Harris poll conducted in 2005  NPR was voted the most trusted news source in the U S  29   edit  Digital media NPR s history in digital media includes the work of an independent  for profit company called Public Interactive  which was founded in 1999 30  and acquired by PRI in June 2004  when it became a non profit company  31  By July 2008  Public Interactive had  170 subscribers who collectively operate 325 public radio and television stations  and clients such as Car Talk  The World  and The Tavis Smiley Show  by the end of that month  NPR acquired Public Interactive from PRI 30  In March 2011  NPR revealed a restructuring proposal in which Boston based Public Interactive would become NPR Digital Services  separate from the Washington D C  based NPR Digital Media  which focuses on NPR branded services  32  NPR Digital Services would continue offering its services to public TV stations  32  The technical backbone of its digital news publishing system is Core Publisher  which was built on Drupal  the open source content management system  32  NPR has been dubbed as  leveraging the Twitter generation   because of its adaptation of the popular microblogging service as one of its primary vehicles of information  Of NPR s Twitter followers  the majority  67   still do listen to NPR on the radio  According to Mashable com  in a survey of more than 10 000 respondents  NPR found that its Twitter  Twitter  followers are younger  more connected to the social web  and more likely to access content through digital platforms such as NPR s website  podcasts  mobile apps and more  NPR has more than one Twitter account  its survey found that most respondents followed between two and five NPR accounts  including topical account  show specific accounts and on air staff accounts  33  In addition  NPR s Facebook Page has been at the forefront of the company foray into social media  Started by college student and fan Geoff Campbell 34  in 2008  the page was quickly taken over by the organization  35  and over the last two years has grown to over 2 2 million fans and is a popular example of the company s new focus on a younger audience  36   edit  Programming  edit  Programs produced by NPR  edit  News and public affairs programs NPR News logo NPR produces a morning and an

International such as This American Life   Living on Earth and Whad Ya Know  are broadcast on public radio stations  but are not affiliated with NPR  PRI and NPR are separate production and distribution organizations with distinct missions  and each competes with the other for programming slots on public radio stations  Public Radio Exchange also offers a national distribution network where a significant number of public radio stations go to acquire programs from independent producers  PRX provides a catalog of thousands of radio pieces available on demand as broadcast quality audio files and available for streaming on the PRX org website  Most public radio stations are NPR member stations and affiliate stations of PRI  APM  and PRX at the same time  The organizations have different governance structures and missions and relationships with stations  Other popular shows  like A Prairie Home Companion and Marketplace  are produced by American Public Media  the national programming unit of Minnesota Public Radio  These programs were distributed by Public Radio International prior to APM s founding  Democracy Now   the flagship news program of the Pacifica Radio network  provides a feed to NPR stations  and other Pacifica programs can occasionally be heard on these stations as well  Additionally  NPR member stations distribute a series of podcast only programs  such as Planet Money  On Gambling with Mike Pesca  Groove Salad  and Youthcast  which are designed for younger audiences   edit  Controversies Main article  NPR controversies Over the course of NPR s history  controversies have arisen over several incidents and topics   edit  Allegations of ideological bias NPR has been accused of displaying both liberal bias  as alleged in work such as a UCLA and University of Missouri study of Morning Edition  and conservative bias  including criticism of alleged reliance on conservative think tanks  37  NPR has also been accused of bias related to specific topics  including support of the 2003 Invasion of Iraq  and coverage of Israel  The NPR ombudsman has described how NPR s coverage of the Israel Palestinian conflict has been simultaneously criticized as biased by both sides  38  University of Texas journalism professor and author  Robert Jensen  has criticized NPR for its pro war stance during coverage of Iraq war protests  39  Surveys and follow up focus groups conducted by the Tarrance Group and Lake Snell Perry  amp  Associates have indicated that   The majority of the U S  adult population does not believe that the news and information programming on public broadcasting is biased  The plurality of Americans indicate that there is no apparent bias one way or the other  while approximately one in five detect a liberal bias and approximately one in ten detect a conservative bias   40   edit  Mumia Abu Jamal commentaries In 1994  NPR arranged to air commentaries by Mumia Abu Jamal  a man convicted of murdering a police

Palestine and funding for NPR  Schiller immediately resigned  and NPR disavowed Schiller s comments  CEO Vivian Schiller  who is not related to Ronald  later resigned over the fallout from the comments and the previous firing of Juan Williams  44   edit  See also American Public Media Australian Broadcasting Corporation BBC Radio Canadian Broadcasting Corporation List of NPR personnel List
