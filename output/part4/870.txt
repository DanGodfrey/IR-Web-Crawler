story arc in Marvel Comics which ran from 1994 to 1996 involving many clones of Spider Man  The story is one of the most controversial Spider Man stories ever told  Although it was intended to wrap up in less than a year  the comics sold very well and the writers were encouraged to prolong the saga as long as possible  This led to some changes to the storyline that ultimately proved unpopular  1  Although there were many people involved  the Clone Saga is most closely associated with Terry Kavanagh  who proposed the idea  Howard Mackie  who worked on the majority of the smaller crossovers involved in the overall storyarc and Gerry Conway  who devised the original story  Executive editors on the storyline included Tom DeFalco  Bob Budiansky  and Bob Harras  Contents 1 Storyline 1 1 The

Clone Sagas   the original storyline in the 1970s and the second saga which consumed all the regular Spider Man series  several limited series and one shots between 1994 and 1997  Between the two  there were also two smaller storylines that dealt with elements from the original saga  Cover to Amazing Spider Man  149  October 1975   Cover pencil art by Gil Kane  interior pencil art by Ross Andru   edit  The original Clone Saga In the summer of 1973  writer Gerry Conway made the decision to kill off the girlfriend of Peter Parker  Gwen Stacy  because the editorial team felt that Gwen had become stale as a character and they wanted to instill an additional element of tragedy into Peter Parker s life  2  In the follow up arcs  Conway introduced a new villain  the masked Jackal  and let Gwen Stacy seemingly return from the dead  The Jackal was the secret identity of Gwen and Peter s biology professor Miles Warren  who could not cope with the death of his secret love  Gwen  As an expert on cloning  he creates clones of both Gwen and Peter  discovering Peter is Spider Man as a result  Jackal blames Spider Man for Gwen s death and wants to kill him  3  The Jackal kidnaps Spider Man and forces him to fight his clone  Both men believe they are the real Peter Parker  The two Spider Men soon decide to work together  but one is seemingly killed by the same bomb that kills the Jackal  The surviving Spider Man determines he is the original because he is in love with Mary Jane Watson  which didn t happen until after Prof  Warren created the clone  Spider Man drops the body of the clone into an incinerator  Gwen Stacy s clone disappears to find a new life for herself  3  A few years later  Spider Man encountered Carrion  who claimed to be a degenerated clone of Warren  4  The clone of Gwen Stacy reappeared many years later when she was being pursued by the High Evolutionary  who was determined to discover how Warren had been able to perfect cloning  In the process  he discovered that Warren had not  but had instead created a genetic virus which transformed already living beings   Gwen Stacy  was seemingly cured of the virus and left to lead her own life once more  Later  Spider Man investigated Warren s old laboratory and discovered that Carrion had in fact been a genetic weapon created by Warren  Another former student of Warren s  Malcolm McBride  became infected with the virus and became the new Carrion  5  After that  with Scarlet Spider Unlimited  1  this story arc was molded to fit into the New Clone Saga   edit  The second Clone Saga More years passed before Spider Man s clone reappeared  He had survived the battle and for five years had lived an existence under the name Ben Reilly  a combination of Peter s Uncle Ben s first name and Aunt May s maiden name   A series of chaotic events followed  in which Peter and Ben were plagued by both a resurrected Jackal and by Kaine  who was an unsuccessful first clone  In the process  another clone of Spider Man became the villain Spidercide  Matters were further confused by the interventions of the mysterious and seemingly all powerful Judas Traveller and Scrier  The revelations made by the High Evolutionary were revealed to have been inaccurate  driven by a determination to discredit Warren  who had formerly worked with him  Medical tests indicated Peter was actually the clone and Ben the original  Peter temporarily retired as Spider Man  leaving the mantle of Spider Man to Ben while he prepared for his new role as a father after the discovery that Mary Jane was pregnant  Peter even lost his powers for a time during his  retirement   although they eventually came back after a near death experience  An explosive climax revealed that Peter  Ben  the Jackal and many others had all been manipulated for years by Norman Osborn a k a the Green Goblin  who had returned from the dead and had been secretly masterminding the entire saga all along  Osborn said Peter was the original  having faked the evidence that revealed Peter s status as the clone as part of a plan to break Peter s spirit   a claim that was confirmed when Ben died saving Peter s life and his body degenerated like any other clone s  Spider Man  The Osborn Journal  February 1997  explains the Green Goblin s role in the entire storyline   edit  Selected bibliography During the mid 1990s  Marvel consistently published four monthly Spider Man series  roughly one every week  For the most part  the Spider titles were treated during this storyline as a single weekly series  although occasionally they would separate  pair off  or have special anniversary editions  The Clone Saga ran through all four titles from October 1994 to December 1996  in addition to a multitude of spin offs  one shots  and

Comics  monumental storylines  The Death of Superman  and  Batman  Knightfall   both of which sold extremely well  Spider Man editor Mark Bernardo said  Marching orders we were given by upper management to come up with something similar in scope to DC s  Death of Superman  storyline  which at the time was breaking sales records left and right  Thus  no outrageous idea was out of bounds  Terry Kavanagh was cajoled into blurting out his clone idea  which first met with groans and indifference  until someone  to my recollection  J M  DeMatteis  suddenly realized the radical possibilities of such a storyline   6  Several of the Spider Man creators believed that the character had drifted too far from his original portrayal and sought a way to restore the Spider Man of old  in particular jettisoning his marriage to Mary Jane  Howard Mackie revealed  When the story was begun we knew it would be controversial  and that was part of the point  He also commented  The return to the single Spider Man did enter the conversation eventually  but it was not the intent of the story when pitched   7  Bernardo added that the length of the arc was initially planned to be short   The whole arc was supposed to end in Amazing Spider Man  400  and leave  Ben Reilly  as the one and only  original Peter Parker  and forge a new beginning  The whole storyline  was supposed to simplify Spider Man s mythos and ultimately bring him  back to basics   Eventually  Editor in Chief Tom Defalco gave the final approval to begin the story  However  there is some discrepancy between the recollections of production staff at the time  confused further by evidence that plans for the direction seemed to shift almost constantly  Furthermore  Marvel s editorial structure at the time was divided into separate  groups  or  families   and some Spider Man editors reported pressure to compete with the X Men family s successful  Age of Apocalypse  event   edit  Establishing the clone Although the readers have been getting clues about a mysterious figure with links to Peter Parker  in the issues leading up to this story  The starting point for the second Clone Saga was not until the end of Spectacular Spider Man  216 comic  Sept 1994   written by Tom DeFalco and Todd Dezago  in which Spider Man is confronted by an exact look a like of himself  8  In the following issues  the writers established the clone s backstory as a frightened  homeless outcast  and introduce the character Judas Traveller  Traveller s agenda was to analyze the true nature of evil  Taking interest in Spider Man and his clone  Traveller and his ally Scrier pit Spider Man both teaming and against his clone in a test of motivation  The writers set up the possibility that the clone could be the real Spider Man  8  The clone was then further developed editorially  and given the name  Ben Reilly by having the character name himself  Additionally  he became known as the super hero the Scarlet Spider complete with unique costume   edit  Early development trouble According to established Spider Man assistant editor Glenn Greenberg  No one    not the writers  not the editors    seemed to know who or what the hell Judas Traveller was  He was seemingly this immensely powerful  quasi mystical being with amazing abilities  but what was the real deal with him      But to be honest  a character like Traveller didn t really fit into Spider Man s world   8  As such  Traveller s role would remain a mystery to readers for a while  as writers dropped him in and out of this saga  A major change in status quo was the decision to make Spider man s wife Mary Jane pregnant  It had been an idea of Tom DeFalco  who felt that  a major  dramatic event that would help set up the  clone  saga s ultimate resolution  would be Mary Jane becoming pregnant   and so the characters pregnancy was written and sold  It was a very controversial move and bold move  Little did they know that it would prove to cause many creative difficulties for years to come  yet it would all work out as part of Delfaco s plan for a new Spider Man to take over  9  But then  Marvel Comics as a company experienced a major financial crisis which nearly bankrupted the company  and the company went through a series of profound changes  9  Editor in chief DeFalco was fired  and Notably  Marvel s comic line was broken into five separate groups each with its own editor in chief and the Spider Man editor became Bob Budiansky 9  By then  the writers had established a new Spider Man foe  namely Kaine  To prove that he was dangerous  and to make room for new villains  the writers had him killing classic Spider Man foes  including Doctor Octopus  and the death so was supposed to be so graphic that fans would rule out any possibility that Dr  Octopus would return  9  However  Kaine soon became another reoccurring character of unexplained origin and purpose  like many others  such as Judas Traveller and the Scrier  whose roles would not be revealed for quite some time  Then  the creative staff brought back the Jackal  the original culprit of the clones  10  He was used as a plot device to explain the  clone degeneration  and also set up the possibility he was part of a greater plan by Judas Traveller and Scrier  10  In this plot developed by J M  DeMatteis  and part written by Todd DeZago and Howard Mackie  Jackal gave readers doubt and suspicion by stating that Peter was the clone  followed by a reverse statement  and then assessing them as both being clones of an original  because of this  the story was considered  convoluted   as well as  confusing and unnecessary  Spider Man Vol 1  56 In a 2008 interview  Glenn Greenberg recalls  It only made sense  from a dramatic standpoint  It was this story that kicked off what would become an increasingly tiresome stream of clones  lies upon lies  fake outs  and convoluted twists and turns   10  At this point  the creative staff  seemingly without strict direction  inserted a lot of open plot points waiting to be resolved  such as Ben Reilly worrying about  degeneration  of his body due to cloning  why Kaine was protecting Spider Man but preying on Ben Reilly  why Ben and Spider man shared dreams  why Kaine was foreseeing Mary Jane s death  who the mysterious new character Seward Trainer was as well as the identity of the  Third Peter Parker  aka Spidercide  9  With a plethora of writers and editors  the storyline was initiated throughout all the regular Spider Man series  but slowly grew out of control  The sales department requested extensions to the storyline  buoyed up by very strong sales on the book at a time when most other comics were experiencing a noticeable decline in buyers  With this extension  the storyline outlived several key creative staff and many decisions on the eventual direction of the storyline were changed  With Amazing Spider Man 400  intended originally to end the series  instead  in a major controversial decision  the writers ended the life of Spider Man s aunt May Parker  a major supporting character since 1962  The writers felt that Aunt May had outlived her usefulness and there was nothing left to do with her  Still the issue was highly praised exemplified by Greenberg elaborating his sentiments  No Spider Man story published since ASM  400 has even come close to matching the quality  the power  the drama  and the heartfelt emotion of this story  A true classic   because of that  he also mentioned that the death of Aunt May should never have been retconed   All despite the fact that May s death was greeted with dismay and contempt by a contingent of very vocal fans    11  In the  Mark of Kaine  storyline by Terry Kavanagh and Mackie  more creative disarray awaited  because they juggled with more and more clones of Spider Man  12  However  Greenberg recalled that the sales of the Spider Man comics skyrocketed  and therefore  the writers were encouraged to keep the saga going longer and longer  12  instead of finishing so many open ended storylines  The plot deepened as Spider Man writer Howard Mackie reintroduced Judas Traveller  Mackie and J M  DeMatteis arc featured Judas Traveller teleporting Spider Man into another dimension and had long philosophical debates on life  death and sorrow  This was widely criticized as out of scope with the down to earth Spider Man comics  13  To add to the chaos  another incarnation of classic Spider Man villain Green Goblin was introduced without any backstory  13   edit  Establishing Ben Reilly as Spider Man At the conclusion of the story arc  The Trial of Peter Parker  in Spectacular Spider Man  226  a major bombshell was dropped in which Peter is revealed by Dr  Seward Trainer as the clone of Ben  Peter Parker Spider Man is so emotionally wrecked by this that he hits his wife by accident  Peter would subsequently retire as Spider Man based on this premise and move to Portland to live with Mary Jane  allowing Ben to take over as Spider Man  This resulted in a major backlash by fans  that wrote letters to Marvel with various complaints   edit  Prolonged The next chapter in the saga became  Maximum Clonage  a storyline was penned by Todd DeZago  who followed up Kavanagh  who had left the project   Mackie  Lyle  DeMatteis  and DeFalco  intended to tie up the many plot lines which had been dangling around for a while  Goletz said that the intended ending was to  begin the new era of Spider Man  Peter and Mary Jane would be written out of the books  and sent off to live in peace with their soon to be born child  Ben would get the chance to establish himself as Spider Man and move forward  Going into the planning stages for what would turn out to be  Maximum Clonage   the intent was indeed to finish up the clone story line once and for all and quickly get Ben started as Spider Man   14  Also  the Gwen Stacy clone who had started the whole Clone Saga in the 1970s was to be killed to provide a fitting end  14  But impressed by the Age of Apocalypse crossover of sister Marvel Comics title X Men  in which huge sales were achieved by long  spread out story lines  Bob Budiansky ordered to duplicate this recipe for the Maximum Clonage project  Instead of tying up loose ends  the story was changed in such a way that practically every issue brought up new clones  The climax was  Maximum Clonage  Part 3   in which Ben Reilly encounters hundreds of his clones  The stories became more and more absurd  with the Peter teaming up with the Jackal  Spidercide turning on his creator with influence from the Scrier  and finally Jackal  Kaine  and Spidercide getting killed off in a contrived  virus bomb  plot  However  the Gwen Stacy clone slips away unnoticed and ever since then  has not been a part of the fiction as of 2011  The story arc was heavily criticized for its undefined character motives  and an apparent lack of distinction between villains  heroes  and their allies  15   edit  Failed relaunch Following the end of  Maximum Clonage   the creative staff launched revamps of established villains  a new female Doctor Octopus  a new Vulture  and the Grim Hunter  the son of the dead Kraven the Hunter   without much success  Plot lines were long and sprawling  in spite of Bob Budiansky s plan to finally end the limbo  and replace Peter Parker as Spider Man and establish Ben Reilly as his successor  It took so long that DeMatteis  who was impatiently waiting for the green light to launch the Ben Reilly as Spider Man comics  resigned  16  In retrospect  he was right  Greenberg recalled   The idea was to have each Spider Man book retitled so that the Scarlet Spider s name would replace Spider Man s   AMAZING SCARLET SPIDER  SPECTACULAR SCARLET SPIDER  BEN REILLY SCARLET SPIDER  and WEB OF SCARLET SPIDER  We d get four new number  1 s out of it  and it would be a way to capitalize on the Scarlet Spider s popularity one last time before he became  the new  Spider Man  What that meant was holding off Ben s debut as Spider Man even longer   16  By that time  the Marvel marketing division had completely overpowered the creative department and could do whatever they wanted  16   edit  Change of heart The idea was to move Ben forward as the main character and replace Peter Parker as Spider Man  Thus the story  Return of Spider Man  was written  and debuted in the newest series Sensational Spider Man  0  In this story Ben finds a new Spider suit and develops a life of his own  It seemed that having Ben as the new Spider Man would work but replacing Peter Parker would prove to be very difficult  due to the fact that Ben looked exactly like Peter  so naturally characters would mistake him for Peter  This was written as part of the fiction as the explanation for Ben dyeing his hair blonde  which was in reality insisted by editor Budiansky  More major efforts were taken to solidify Ben as the new Spidey and focus of the series  such as establishing a supporting cast for Ben  However  there were many staff that had a hard time accepting Ben as Peter s replacement  most notably the new writer of  Sensational   Dan Jurgens  Jurgens wanted to work on the Peter Parker version of the character  and was disappointed to have Ben instead  and so he made a very convincing plea to Budiansky to bring back Parker  arguing that Ben confused new readers  and was a disappointment to long time readers who had grown to love Parker  Budiansky was sold on the idea  17  The this decision resulted in creative chaos  illustrated by the Spider Man  The Final Adventure limited series  originally intended to write Peter Parker and the pregnant Mary Jane Watson out of the Spider Man comics  have their baby and give them a happy farewell  finally  Ben Reilly would be the sole focal point of the franchise  18  Instead Budiansky suddenly decided to reinstate Peter Parker as Spider Man at all costs  18  But he did not want a super hero who was a father  So therefore  writer Fabian Nicieza had to change the ending to the limited series giving it less of an impact  and as the plot events that occurred during it  were reversed soon by new stories  18   edit  Developing explanations Plot twists had become so confusing that readers and staff demanded closure of the Clone Saga  and pointed out that what the readers and staff demanded was an  end   Editor Glenn Greenberg explained the scenario   The big question became  how do we bring Peter back as Spider Man without it looking like a colossal cop out  What would be the most exciting  dramatic  satisfying way to accomplish this task  Bob Budiansky was looking for a great idea  and he didn t care where it came from   17  In the storyline  Return of Kaine   in addition to revealing that Kaine is alive  the plot introduced a skeleton that was discovered in the original clone saga lab wearing a Spider Man suit  This was a way of suggesting that maybe neither Ben nor Peter were clones  This was ultimately used as a plot device to bring Peter back  which also meant having to separate him from MJ  nullifying her pregnancy  and therefore work backwards  This ultimately made things more difficult and again led to much debate about whether to re instate Peter as Spider Man or keep Ben  Meanwhile the ID of the skeleton was completely undecided  Eventually a story titled  Blood Brothers  began and would lead to revealing everything  Greenberg elaborated the set up of the resolution   A mysterious figure was intended to be the sole mastermind behind the entire clone saga  a powerful and influential figure who was controlling Seward Trainer and manipulating the lives of Peter Parker and Ben Reilly from the shadows  Forced to wear an environmental suit to maintain his life functions  he would eventually be restored to health by Seward  and at that point  we would reveal his identity   19  But before he was revealed  a major breakthrough in the creative department occurred  A new idea introduced a detailed and highly optimistic plan  developed to solve everything  The plan would reveal that Peter Parker was sent five years back in time   to the end of the original clone saga   by the Scrier  as part of a contest between himself and Judas Traveller  to determine if mankind was pure or selfish  The Scrier would actually be revealed as Mephisto  the Marvel Comics equivalent of Satan  who would appear at the end of the  Time Loop  to give Ben the option of saving Peter s life in replace for his own  This would eliminate the idea that either Ben or Peter was a clone  instead replacing it with the idea that they were both Peter  and in fact Ben was a Peter from 5 years in the future  that was sent back by Mephisto to co exist with the current Peter  Also the Jackal would be worked into this explanation as making the Peter that was sent back in time  believe that he was a clone  thus taking on the ID of Ben  The major selling point to this plan was  that it would restore the memories of Ben   who was really Peter all along   and thus  hopefully  satisfy long time readers  Many staff members supported this plan  and even the editor attempted to see it through  19   edit  Conflict of opinion The  Time Loop  idea was soon refuted by writers because of the  minimal impact  of Spider Man in that draft  and deemed inappropriate to use characters like Traveller  The same complaint as reflected by DeFalco was that  Mephisto is not a Spider Man villain   and does not fit in the down to earth style Spider Man books were known for  Other villains were suggested to take his place  Also near that time  DeFalco had proposed on a number of occasions that at some point  there should be a scene where Scrier reveals to the audience that he was just a guy in a mask  At various times  Tom D  suggested that Scrier turn out to be the Jackal or Harry Osborn wearing a Scrier costume  and that all of the  awesome power  displayed by both Scrier and Judas Traveller was just clever trickery  20  Many more ideas  possibilities  and scenarios were running rampant but the  Time Loop  idea remained the most popular  yet there was a writers against editors atmosphere at Marvel Comics and none were unanimously accepted  so the group fell into a creative stalemate  21  Greenberg recalls that  Budiansky was mired in indecision  and it was hurting the entire line   Ultimately it was a memo from Dan Jurgens  written as a last ditch effort to provide what he felt was a proper ending to the clone saga  The memo went against the  Time Loop  scenario and would exclude Traveller and Scrier  Essentially the story was tragic and would include not only the death of Ben as a clone  but also MJ losing her baby and possibly wanting to separate from Pete  That would have become the new direction for the  blood brothers  story if not for what was to come  As a result of a downgrade  Marvel dissolved the five EICs into one  Bob Harras  and under his reign  he ordered the clone saga s finale to be postponed due to the major Crossover event  Onslaught  that was about to happen  So for 6 months the conclusion was delayed  This resulted in Jurgens quitting the company  Meanwhile Budiansky was downgraded to Spider Man group editor  The plan under Budiansky had been to develop Harry Osborn as the mastermind of the clone saga  Harras described how he always felt that Harry was inferior to Norman Osborn  Regardless of this  Budiansky hated the idea of bringing Norman back  and felt that  Norman s death should never be undone  as he said  In my opinion  It s too classic  Let him rest in peace   Budiansky wanted to resolve everything in the best way possible  The fact that Budiansky had managed to maintain the sales on Spider Man  and even improve them  during a time when sales were going down across the entire comics industry  was not enough to save him  just as they were finally settling on a solid new direction and a definite conclusion to the story  he was fired  22   edit  New direction and leadership Marvel dissolved the five EICs into one  Bob Harras  and Harras replaced Budiansky with Ralph Macchio as editor and under his reign  the main plot became that Peter was dying from what would seem to be  clone degeneration  but actually turned out to be Peter regaining his powers spontaneously  Meanwhile  in the book titled  Redemption  the final chapter in the fictional long running Kaine  amp  Ben relationship would come to a dramatic conclusion  that saw Kaine  amp  Ben saving each other  and Kaine taken to prison where he would remain for the rest of the saga  When it came time for Harras to implement his idea that Norman Osborn would be the master planner of the cloning  it was poorly received by staff  Glenn Greenberg elaborated that  The reaction was not enthusiastic  I don t think ANYONE   from the writers to the editors to the assistant editors   agreed with Harras s idea  as they stated things like  We would be totally betraying the trust of the fans if we went in and undid that story  As much as some of us  including me  tried to change his mind  he was firm in his belief   Harras felt that Norman was the only solution  yet we felt there was simply no way that we d ever be able to address and fix every continuity conundrum raised by Norman s return    23   edit  Resolution Finally  the  Revelations  story arc was penned  in which Seward Trainer is killed by Norman Osborn himself  Harras maintained a strict control over the plotting and refused to compromise on many points  As a consequence  Mary Jane s baby is seemingly stillborn and taken to Europe by Alison Mongraine  per orders of Norman  Upon being submitted to hospital  Mary Jane seemingly miscarried  and she was told by her Doctor that her baby had been killed  However  the Doctor supervising the pregnancy was also an agent of Osborn   Revelations  reveals the man in the environmental suit to be Mendel Stromm  a former partner of Osborn who had been thought dead for quite some time  The final ending came in Spider Man  75  There  Norman Osborn reveals himself to Peter  amp  Ben and says he wants revenge  He shows them the scar on his chest from when he was impaled by the glider to prove he is a real Norman and nothing else  He also explains that the goblin formula regenerated his vital organs  Norman then reveals to them that Ben has been the clone all a long  Norman explains to them that he manipulated Jackal  and Seward  to do his bidding  his goal being to try and convince Peter that his life was worthless by making him believe that he was his own clone  only for Peter s strength of will to prove sufficient to help him overcome his shock at this discovery and make a new life for himself  In the following fight  Ben Reilly tries to help Peter  but is mortally wounded by Osborn s trademark goblin glider and dies  his body dissolving  proving once and for all that he was the clone  In the end  Mary Jane and Peter rejoin as Peter says he already knows about their baby  and together they mourn  In the trade paperback collection of  Revelations   there are 14 additional pages by John Romita Jr  These pages include Ben s fight with Norman  and a congregation of Ben s friends  including Jimmy Six  at Aunt May s to mourn  Peter than brings Ben s ashes  as Spider Man  to the top of the Brooklyn Bridge and dumps them into the wind  The counter part to this story   The Osborn Journal   written by Glenn Greenberg and illustrated by Kyle Hotz  reveals the details of how Norman survived being impaled by the glider so long ago  and his thoughts leading up to the events of  Revelations   This book also describes how Stromm was rejuvenated with Osborn s help  and along with Jackal  Seward  Traveller  and the Scrier s  became part of Osborn s plan to steal Peter s identity and humanity  The issue also resolves many plot points including the infamous skeleton in the smokestack  yet it fails to acknowledge the disappearance or whereabouts of the Gwen Stacy clone  24   edit  Spider Man  The Real Clone Saga Ex editor in chief Tom DeFalco said that under him  the Clone Saga would have been resolved in a different way   Our plan was to structure the clone saga like a three act play  Act One would climax at or around Amazing  400   when we revealed that Pete was the clone and Ben was the real guy  Act Two would last around three months and follow Ben s adventures  In Act Three  Peter would triumphantly return as the one  true Spider Man  Mark and I was hoping the Spider crew could make Ben a viable character during his turn in the spotlight  and we planned to star Ben in his own monthly title after Peter returned  It was kind of like what I had already done with Thor and Thunderstrike two very different titles based on a single concept  Of course  our plan went into the trash the day I got fired   25  In September 2009  a six part mini series based on the outline of the original Clone Saga came out  Written by Tom DeFalco and Howard Mackie  and drawn by Todd Nauck  this  writer s cut  mini series gave the story as it was originally conceived  Series Co creator Howard Mackie  described how this project had a long  meandering origin which was born out of multiple conversations  over a period of years  with Editor Ralph Macchio   Somewhere along the line I discovered a notebook which contained the original notes from the very first meeting at which the clone story was discussed  The original notes showed that the story was planned as a three month event spread across the four monthly Spider Man titles  At some point Ralph talked to Joe Quesada  and I got a phone call from Ralph asking if I wanted to do a mini series showing a version that was truer to what the writers originally imagined  Tom and I remember certain story points differently  The goal with this mini series was get back to basics  to strip away the extraneous stuff that got layered onto the original story  and to present the cleanest possible version of what was a pretty simple story at heart  It was decided that it would be best if only two writers collaborated on this mini series   7  The first issue reintroduced Ben Reilly and Kaine  as well as addressed Mary Jane s pregnancy and Aunt May s hospitalization  an infection that is seemingly incurable  Ben and Peter bond after Kaine attacks them  and Ben stays in New York as Peter s blond haired cousin so he can build a life of his own  He also adopts the identity of the Scarlet Spider and works at the Daily Grind  Ben  Peter  and Kaine reach the lair of the shadowy figure responsible for infecting Aunt May and Mary Jane with a genetic virus  The villain is revealed to be Jackal  who captures all three and reveals that he plans to make an army of Spider Clones and take over the world  Since Ben was the only clone to turn out stable  Jackal takes a sample of his blood to perfect his cloning technique of Peter  while noting mixing the two would be catastrophic  A mastermind over Jackal wants the blood sample as well  for the body of Norman Osborn  Jackal intends to clone Gwen Stacy and another unknown figure  and Kaine breaks himself  Ben  and Peter free  During the subsequent fight  the clones desolve and Jackal suggests that Ben is the original Peter Parker  Kaine kills Jackal  Ben and Peter escape with the cure and save Aunt May and Mary Jane  who is revealed to be pregnant  Peter retires  saying Ben is the real one  so Ben creates a new costume  Peter and MJ begin planning for their baby with the support of Aunt May  a radical departure from the original saga  where May died not long after her recovery  leaving Peter and MJ to prepare for the baby alone   while Peter focuses on acquiring a research grant  in the original saga  he was framed for murder and faced a long court battle   Ben battles Doctor Octopus  who escapes after knocking down debris  After Ben tracks Octavius down  the villain notes that the newly costumed Spider Man seems to be an imposter  Kaine arrives and attempts to kill Octopus  a great retcon from the original Saga  where Kaine murders Octavius  who is later replaced with a female version  by asphyxiating him with some webbing and then escaping  Ben shreds the webbing off  saving his enemy s life  MJ s water breaks at the Daily Grind while she is with May  so they inform Peter and Ben and rush to the hospital  Donning web shooters  Ben and Peter swing to the hospital in their respective Spider Man costumes  another retcon departure  in the original  the two never appeared in costume together   coming into a short conflict with Kaine  who escapes and is chased by Ben as Peter goes to the hospital  At the hospital  nurse Allison Mongraine takes them to the delivery room  Originally  Mongraine induced labor using poisoned coffee with a doctor s help  but in the new storyline  she is working alone   The baby is born and named May Parker  Mongraine takes the baby to ready her for the parents  but actually hands the baby to Kaine at the docks  another departure as Mongraine exited without a meeting   Kaine tells the mastermind he has the baby  who remarks that it will be raised overseas  The mastermind  now in control of a Parker blood sample  resurrects Norman  who is shocked by the identity of the man who has brought him to life  The mastermind  Harry Osborn  gives a Green Goblin mask to Norman and tells him there is work to be done  Moments later  Ben  as Spider man  is attacked by a new Green Goblin  who identifies Spider Man both as  Ben  and a clone  The Goblin impales Ben with his glider  Ben is kept alive with the Goblin and captured as bait for Peter  After assaulting Ben  the Green Goblin reveals himself as Harry and reasserts that Ben is just a clone  Kaine speaks with the revived Norman  who is a clone  and discusses baby May s fate  Kaine tells Norman he feels that May is his family in addition to Ben  Peter  Mary Jane  and the elder May  and she should not be held accountable for the sins of her father  Harry deploys a Goblin signal outside the building  OsCorp   which attracts Peter  who is still searching for his daughter  Peter finds Ben and both are threatened to be killed by Harry  but he decides to give the honor to Norman  who blasts Harry and tells him that he cannot continue the cycle of violence  that Harry s madness is a product of Norman s sins  Peter frees Ben  and both help Norman  Peter s shoulder is dislocated  and Ben demands to know where baby May is  as Aunt May and Mary Jane wonder where Peter is  Kaine enters through a window with baby May and gives her to her family  May remarks that Kaine  seems familiar  and asks if they know one another  Kaine responds   No  and that is my loss  and exits  Back at OsCorp  Harry is restrained by Ben  so he activates his glider to impale Peter from behind  Ben prepares to leap in the path of the flying glider  but Norman jumps in the way  killing himself with it once more  Norman disintegrates due to cellular degeneration  in the original  it was Ben s body that melted   Harry vows to get even  The scene cuts to Aunt May  Mary Jane  Peter  Ben and the baby outside May s home  another departure  as the baby was missing at the conclusion of the original   where it is revealed that Kaine is missing and Harry is in a sanitarium  Ben leaves the city  but says he will return from time to time  Peter tells Ben that both villains were liars  and it does not matter who is the clone  but they each have a life  The final spread shows Ben riding away on his motorcycle and a giant mirage of the Scarlet Spider above him  In the distance MJ asks Peter if he thinks Ben will ever return and he remarks   Trust me  MJ  We haven t seen the last of Ben Reilly or the Scarlet Spider    edit  Criticism The decision to replace Peter with Ben as the regular  true Spider Man met with a massive outcry from many readers and was also unpopular with many of the creative staff of the day  The parts with Judas Traveller and Scrier were seen as being widely out of Spider Man s league  coincidentally  this was similar to the plot device used by Marvel for the Spider Man storyline  One More Day   which retconned Peter s marriage to Mary Jane   The decision to resurrect the original Green Goblin was also very controversial  his death was part of  The Death of Gwen Stacy  storyline that was widely considered a classic  but it was deemed necessary by Marvel s then Editor in Chief  Glenn Greenberg author of the Osborn Journal commented  If Norman was alive and watching everything from the shadows  why did he let his son Harry die  Why did he let the first Hobgoblin come into being especially since Hobgoblin  1 broke into Norman s secret hideout and stole his personal journals    He further mentioned    Tom  Brevoort didn t think Norman s return could ever possibly work    and  Brevoort felt that there was just no way that Norman could have been alive all that time  Tom B  felt that if Norman could manipulate Spider Man s life from afar  for so long  to such an extent  then so much of what had occurred in the books over the years would never have happened  or would have happened very differently   20  Spider Man editor Mark Bernardo said  the length of the story arc was initially planned to be short  but rapidly spun out of control and ended as a fiasco  Ironically  the whole storyline  which was supposed to simplify Spider Man s mythos and ultimately bring him  back to basics  ended up complicating everything beyond what anyone imagined   6  Howard Mackie stated that  the Clone Saga has not always had the best rap  The thing that struck me in reading various things on the Internet is that people would complain about the Clone Saga  and then go on about how wonderful Ben Reilly was  There is a big movement of  Bring Back Ben Reilly  folks  I found that very curious   Interview host Matt Adler seemed to get to the heart of the criticism when he asked Mackie  You could have liked Ben as the Scarlet Spider  but disapproved of him replacing Peter Parker  Or you might have liked Ben as Spider Man  but were displeased with how the Saga was resolved  Do you think having all those wildly disparate elements phases makes it more difficult for readers to embrace the original Saga as a whole   To which Mackie replies  Yes  and that is why I think the original  short  simple and direct story should have been stuck to  Even if it had not ended the way some of the readers had wanted  it would have been a tighter story  One that could have been more easily resolved   and further laments  The Clone story became the Clone Saga because the powers that be got cold feet based on initial impact from a vocal group of readers   7  Recognizing the chaos of the storyline  Marvel eventually parodied it in Spider Man  101 Ways to End the Clone Saga  January 1997   The Clone Saga was parodied again with a gag cover for  Sheep Man  in an issue of What If    that had a text box saying  Part 1 of 80 of the New Sheep Clone Saga   AAAAAGGGHH  NOT AGAIN   In an issue of his own series  Deadpool frequently states that  kids don t like clones   In one of the last pre One More Day Spider man comics  J  Jonah Jameson remarks several times that he hates clones   edit  Follow up in MC2 While the mainstream Spider Man titles rarely touches upon the Clone Saga  The supposedly alternate universe of MC2 Spider Girl  May  Mayday  Parker  can be considered a distant sequel  The series establishes that six months after Spider Man  Revelations Mongrane was tracked down by Peter s first clone Kaine  who rescued baby Mayday from her grip and returned her to her parents Peter Parker and Mary Jane  subsequently she grows up to become Spider Girl    The events of The Final Chapter  or more accurately   The Gathering of Five    take place two years later  At the conclusion of the MC2 version of the  Gathering  storyline  Peter and Norman Osborn s final battle costs Osborn his life and Peter one of his legs  Mayday generally wears the costume based on Ben Reilly s Spider Man design  Elizabeth Tyne Janine Godbe from The Lost Years had Ben s son  Reilly Tyne  Darkdevil   Felicity Hardy fights crime as The Scarlet Spider  Kaine is also a recurring character  Spider Girl  44 50 and 52 focus on loose ends of the Clone Saga  such as Alison Mongrain planning to kill Normie Osborn  believing he could pose a threat to the child who was placed in her care  May reveals herself to Alison  in order to save Normie  Alison is last seen in Spider Girl  52   44 is noteworthy as Peter tells May about her Uncle Ben  minus the fact he was a clone  Overall  the issue recaps the Clone Saga storyline  There was to have been a panel with Ben Reilly in his Scarlet Spider outfit  but it was left out  26  hence the cover mentions him as The Scarlet Spider  A new Clone Saga began in the pages of Amazing Spider Girl  Normie Osborn  inheriting a few of his grandfather s laboratories  stumbles across a fluid tank containing an exact physical duplicate of Mayday Parker  with several journal entries left behind by Norman Osborn indicating that she is the real Mayday  This May is eventually revealed to have symbiotic powers  Eventually  both Mays come to an understanding and  with the aid of Peter and the spirit of his late Aunt May  defeat Norman Osborn in a psychic duel when all three Parkers are merged briefly into one body controlled by Norman s active consciousness  The story continued in The Spectacular Spider Girl  a feature being published both online and in the pages of the new Web of Spider Man  In it  the new May changes her name to April and becomes Mayday s rival and occasional partner  Eventually  April is defeated by the Fury The Goblin Queen and told that she is the clone  April is eventually freed and together  she and Mayday defeat Fury  April afterwards begins to get involved with the gang warfare erupting in New York and eventually cuts herself off from The Parker Family  The saga ends with a future incarnation of April  having experienced a drasticly darker future which is created from Mayday s death  travels back in time and urges her past self to save Mayday s life  April agrees  and seemingly sacrifices her own life to save Mayday as she caught in a ferocious explosion  Mayday mourns April s passing  though Peter is not convinced of her death and assures May that clones have a habit of turning up again   edit  Ultimate Spider Man Clone Saga The cover for Ultimate Spider Man  103  Art by Mark Bagley  The Clone Saga was adapted for Marvel s Ultimate imprint  It began in Ultimate Spider Man  97  July 2006  and concluded in  104  27  with a small epilogue in  105  In the Ultimate Spider Man continuity  the character Miles Warren was first introduced as Harry Osborn s psychiatrist who was hired by Norman Osborn to brainwash out any memories of his Goblin persona  Ben Reilly was established as an African American lab assistant with no personal ties to Peter  Although in the  Carnage  story arc  Reilly refers to the Carnage creature as  Little Ben   The creature itself being created from Peter Parker s and Curt Conner s DNA with traces of the Venom suit s genetic material as well  In this version  Bendis wrote a story in which the Ultimate Scorpion is captured and revealed to be Peter s clone  sharing 94 2  of Peter Parker s DNA  issues 97  98   MJ is then abducted  and searching for her  Peter runs into Ultimate Spider Woman  and in the following issues  further Spider Man clones appear  among them one with a disfigured face  Kaine  and a black suited clone with six arms  Tarantula   Bendis also made Peter reveal his secret identity to Aunt May and the Fantastic Four  and let an amnesiac Gwen Stacy and Peter s presumed dead father Richard re appear  though the former of the two actually escaped   Via a longer dialogue through Peter and Spider Woman  Bendis also established that every clone has inherited Peter s love for MJ  and his worries of her getting hurt  as a result  they each tried a different approach  the Scorpion trying to make sense of his jumbled memories  Spider Woman trying to stop the other clones  Kaine using his advanced mind to incorporate the drug OZ into MJ s body  and the Tarantula trying to defend MJ from Kaine  Upon waking to find that she has been injected with OZ  MJ is enraged  and her anger triggers a transformation into a large  red monster  As of issue 103  the masterminds behind the clones seem to be Dr  Octopus and Ben Reilly  Reilly stole a sample of Peter s blood shortly after the death of Gwen Stacy   A fight between the clones and Dr  Octopus leaves the Tarantula and Kaine apparently dead  and Dr  Octopus captured by S H I E L D  As a twist  Bendis established that Dr  Octopus and Reilly acted with consent of the FBI  In addition  Gwen is revealed to be Carnage  and Richard revealed to be yet another clone  issues 99 103   aged artificially and given psychic treatment to create his false memories  As of the end of the Ultimate Clone Saga  the clone posing as Richard Parker died from his rapid aging  Jessica Drew fled after helping Peter defeat Octavius  and Doctors Franklin Storm and Reed Richards found a cure for Mary Jane s OZ related affliction  Peter s relief at her safe condition made him realize his true feelings for her and resumed their relationship  Reed Richards suggested that they might even remove Peter s powers after some more research  since they are also partially caused by the OZ serum  However  after a talk with Nick Fury  Peter rejects the cure and got back together with MJ  The Spider Woman clone left to embrace the  Jessica Drew  identity and the other remaining clones   the Scorpion and Gwen Stacy   were left in the custody of Nick Fury  who advised his Scientists to  get to work  on them  In re imagining the story for the Ultimate Universe  Brian Bendis inserted many references to the original Clone Saga  Among them are that the brief appearances of the characters Miles Warren and Ben Reilly  Peter re examining his relationship with MJ  an amnesiac Gwen Stacy appearing from nowhere  then turning out to be more than she seems  Aunt May experiencing a heart attack  a  Scarlet Spider   Spider Woman  evading Peter and later being used as a plot dump  a half formed  semi insane clone appearing several times  specifically wanting to protect MJ  a  mystery woman  called  Jessica   an old friend and colleague of Norman Osborn appearing to have been manipulating the scenes from behind  Dr  Mendel Stromm in normal Marvel continuity  Otto Octavius in Ultimate Marvel continuity   later revealing unseen powers over metal   edit  Television Further information  The Return of Hydro Man and Spider Wars In Spider Man  The Animated Series  the Clone Saga appears in two forms  First in the show  Spider Man is reunited with Mary Jane after she disappeared into a vortex in his last fight with the original Green Goblin  It was soon revealed that this Mary Jane was a clone as was the resurrected Hydro Man all of which were the product of the experiments of Miles Warren  Spider Man tears his costume in a fight with the Hydro Man clone  The Mary Jane clone saves him with water powers she has by virtue of her body structure being derived from Hydro Man  Warren runs off from an upcoming flood Hydro Man s clone would create and finds a piece of Spider Man s costume  hinting at the possible cloning of Peter Parker  Due to their unstable cell structures  the Mary Jane and Hydro Man clones evaporate in front of Spider Man  The death of the Mary Jane clone devastates him  and he is next taken to another dimension by Madame Web to fight in the animated version of the Secret Wars  Warren managed to get a sample of Spider Man s DNA from a torn piece of his costume  The Six Spider Men that join to defeat Spider Carnage in Spider Wars  After that was the two part Spider Wars series finale  where Spider Man is presented in an alternate reality version of the Clone Saga  In this version of events  though  the revelation that Peter is the clone  and Ben Reilly is the original leads Peter to become incredibly depressed and vulnerable  The Carnage symbiote takes advantage of this and merges with Peter Parker  becoming the composite being known as Spider Carnage  who then attempts to destroy all of existence  which includes all universes  from his native universe  Later  after his plan to destroy all of reality is stopped by the original Spider Man and other Spider Men from different realities  including the Scarlet Spider  Carnage attempts to destroy every reality  one at a time  starting with the universe that was home to a wealthy  armored version of Spider Man  However  the  prime  Spider Man follows Spider Carnage into that reality  Realizing that his armored counterpart is so arrogant because he has never failed  the  prime  Spider Man contacts that reality s version of Uncle Ben  the only person who might be able to get through to Spider Carnage  The gamble works  and Spider Carnage stops the chain of destruction he had been about to initiate  He sacrifices himself by jumping in one of his unstable portals from the Time Dilation Accelerator in his reality which disintegrates him  The  prime  Spider Man at one point remarks   This is starting to sound like a bad comic book plot   and part of the arc was called  I Really  Really Hate Clones   The Spider Carnage character first appeared in comics  and was the result of a forced merger between the Carnage entity and Ben Reilly  who had taken on the role of Spider Man at that time  The Peter Parker with whom the symbiote merges with was wearing the original version of the costume  however  when the symbiote merges with him  his costume takes on the appearance of Ben Reilly s Spider Man costume  which was itself subtly changed by the creature merging with him   edit  References   Goletz  Andrew  and Glenn Greenberg NewComicsReviews com   Life of Reilly   35 part series  GreyHaven Magazine  2003  n d    100 Greatest Marvels   9 6  introduction to
