in accordance with the laws of the various individual states  territories  and the District of Columbia  Typically each state has at least two separate tiers of local government  counties and municipalities  Some states further have their counties divided into townships  There are several different types of local government at the municipal level  generally reflecting the needs of different levels of population densities  typical examples include the city  town  borough  and village  The types and nature of these municipal entities varies from state to state  Many rural areas and even some suburban areas of many states have no municipal government below the county level  while others do not operate under a distinct county government at all  In other places the different tiers are merged together  for example as a consolidated city county in which city and county functions are managed by a single municipal government  or in the case of towns in New England  which in some states have completely replaced the county as the unit of local government  The local governments described above are classified general purpose local governments by the United States Census Bureau  In addition  there are also often local or regional special purpose local governments  1  Special purpose governments include special districts that exist for specific purposes  such as to provide fire protection  sewer service  transit service or to manage water resources  and in particular school districts to manage schools  Such special purpose districts often encompass areas in multiple municipalities  Contents 1 History of local government in the United States 2 Types of local government 2 1 County governments 2 2 Town or township governments 2 3 Municipal governments 2 4

initially little control from governments back in Europe  2  Many settlements began as shareholder or stockholder business enterprises  and while the king of Britain had technical sovereignty  in most instances  full governmental authority was vested in the company itself   2  Settlers had to fend for themselves  compact towns sprung up based as legal corporations in what has been described as  pure democracy     The people  owing to the necessity of guarding against the Indians and wild animals  and to their desire to attend the same church  settled in small  compact communities  or townships  which they called towns  The town was a legal corporation  was the political unit  and was represented in the General Court  It was a democracy of the purest type  Several times a year the adult males met in town meeting to discuss public questions  to lay taxes  to make local laws  and to elect officers  The chief officers were the  selectmen   from three to nine in number  who should have the general management of the public business  the town clerk  treasurer  constables  assessors  and overseers of the poor  To this day the town government continues in a large measure in some parts of New England   historian Henry William Elson writing in 1904  3    Propertied men voted  in no colonies was there universal suffrage  4  The founding by a group of Puritans in 1629  led by John Winthrop came with the understanding that the enterprise was to be  based in the new world rather than in London   5  Small towns in Massachusetts were compared to city states in a somewhat oligarchic form  but an oligarchy based on  perceived virtue  rather than wealth or birth  5  The notion of self government became accepted in the colonies although it wasn t totally free from challenges  in the 1670s  the Lords of Trade and Plantations  a royal committee regulating mercantile trade in the colonies  tried to annul the Massachusetts Bay charter  but by 1691  the New England colonies had reinstalled their previous governments  6  Voting was established as a precedent early on  in fact  one of the first things that Jamestown settlers did was conduct an election  7  Typically  voters were white males described as  property owners  aged twenty one and older  but sometimes the restrictions were greater  and in practice  persons able to participate in elections were few  7  Women were prevented from voting  although there were a few exceptions  and African Americans were excluded  7  The colonists never thought of themselves as subservient but rather as having a loose association with authorities in London  6  Representative government sprung up spontaneously in various colonies  and during the colonial years  it was recognized and ratified by later charters  2  But the colonial assemblies passed few bills and did not conduct much business  but dealt with a narrow range of issues  and legislative sessions lasted weeks  occasionally longer   and most legislators could not afford to neglect work for extended periods  so wealthier people tended to predominate in local legislatures  7  Office holders tended to serve from a sense of duty and prestige  and not for financial benefit  7    Campaigning by candidates was different from today s  There were no mass media or advertising  Candidates talked with voters in person  walking a line between undue familiarity and aloofness  Prospective officeholders were expected to be at the polls on election day and made a point to greet all voters  Failure to appear or to be civil to all could be disastrous  In some areas  candidates offered voters food and drink  evenhandedly giving  treats  to opponents as well as supporters   Ed Crews  7    Taxes were generally based on real estate since it was fixed in place  plainly visible  and its value was generally well known  and revenue could be allocated to the government unit where the property was located  8  After the American Revolution  the electorate chose the governing councils in almost every American municipality  and state governments began issuing municipal charters  9  During the 19th century  many municipalities were granted charters by the state governments and became technically municipal corporations  9  Townships and county governments and city councils shared much of the responsibility for decision making which varied from state to state  9  As the United States grew in size and complexity  decision making authority for issues such as business regulation  taxation  environmental regulation moved to state governments and the national government  while local governments retained control over such matters as zoning issues  property taxes  and public parks  citation needed  The concept of  zoning  originated in the U S  during the 1920s  according to one source  in which state law gave certain townships or other local governing bodies authority to decide how land was used  a typical zoning ordinance has a map of a parcel of land attached with a statement specifying how that land can be used  how buildings can be laid out  and so forth  10  Zoning legitimacy was upheld by the Supreme Court in its Euclid v  Ambler decision  10   edit  Types of local government The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution makes local government a matter of state rather than federal law  with special cases for territories and the District of Columbia  As a result  the states have adopted a wide variety of systems of local government  The United States Census Bureau conducts the Census of Governments every five years to compile statistics on government organization  public employment  and government finances  The categories of local government established in this Census of Governments is a convenient basis for understanding local government in the United States  The categories are as follows  1  County Governments Town or Township Governments Municipal Governments Special Purpose Local Governments  edit  County governments Main article  County  United States  County governments are organized local governments authorized in state constitutions and statutes  Counties and county equivalents form the first tier administrative division of the states  All the states are divided into counties or county equivalents for administrative purposes  although not all counties or county equivalents have an organized county government  Connecticut and Rhode Island have completely eliminated county government  as have portions of Massachusetts  The Unorganized Borough in Alaska also does not operate under a county level government  Additionally  a number of independent cities and consolidated city counties operate under a municipal government that serves the functions of both city and county  In areas lacking a county government  services are provided either by lower level townships or municipalities  or the state   edit  Town or township governments Main article  Civil township Town or township governments are organized local governments authorized in the state constitutions and statutes of 20 Northeastern and Midwestern states 1   established to provide general government for a defined area  generally based on the geographic subdivision of a county  Depending on state law and local circumstance  a township may or may not be incorporated  and the degree of authority over local government services may vary greatly  Towns in the six New England states and townships in New Jersey and Pennsylvania are included in this category despite the fact that they are legally municipal corporations since their structure has no necessary relation to concentration of population 1   which is typical of municipalities elsewhere in the United States  In particular  towns in New England have considerably more power than most townships elsewhere and often function as independent cities in all but name  typically exercising the full range of powers that are divided between counties  townships  and cities in other states  11  An additional dimension that distinguishes township governments from municipalities is the historical circumstance surrounding their formation  For example  towns in New England are also defined by a tradition of local government presided over by town meetings   assemblies open to all voters to express their opinions on public policy  The term  town  is also used for the local level of government in parts of New York and Wisconsin  The terms  town  and  township  are used interchangeably in Minnesota   edit  Municipal governments Main articles  Municipality  City  Town  Village  United States   and Borough  United States  Municipal governments are organized local governments authorized in state constitutions and statutes  established to provide general government for a defined area  generally corresponding to a population center rather than one of a set of areas into which a county is divided  The category includes those governments designated as cities  boroughs  except in Alaska   towns  except in Minnesota and Wisconsin   and villages  12  This concept corresponds roughly to the  incorporated places  that are recognized in Census Bureau reporting of population and housing statistics  although the Census Bureau excludes New England towns from their statistics for this category  and the count of municipal governments excludes places that are currently governmentally inactive  Municipalities range in size from the very small  e g   the Village of Lazy Lake  Florida  with 38 residents   to the very large  e g   New York City  with about 8 million people   and this is reflected in the range of types of municipal governments that exist in different areas  In most states  county and municipal governments exist side by side  There are exceptions to this  however  In some states  a city can  either by separating from its county or counties or by merging with one or more counties  become independent of any separately functioning county government and function both as a county and as a city  Depending on the state  such a city is known as either an independent city or a consolidated city county  Such a jurisdiction constitutes a county equivalent and is analogous to a unitary authority in other countries  In Connecticut  Rhode Island  and parts of Massachusetts  counties exist only to designate boundaries for such state level functions as park districts or judicial offices  Massachusetts   Municipal governments are usually administratively divided into several departments  depending on the size of the city  Though cities differ in the division of responsibility  the typical arrangement is to have the following departments handle the following roles  Urban planning zoning Economic development tourism Public works   construction and maintenance of all city owned or operated assets  including the water supply system  sewer  streets  stormwater  snow removal  street cleaning  street signs  vehicles  buildings  land  etc  Parks and recreation   construction and maintenance of city parks  common areas  parkways  publicly owned land  operation of various recreation programs and facilities Police Fire Emergency medical services Emergency management Accounting finance   often tax collection  audits Human resources   for city workers General counsel city attorney risk management   legal matters such as writing municipal bonds  ensuring city compliance with state and federal law  responding to citizen lawsuits stemming from city actions or inactions  Transportation  varies widely    if the city has a municipal bus or light rail service  this function may be its own department or it may be folded into the another of the above departments  Information technology   supports computer systems used by city employees  may be also responsible for a city website  phones and other systems  Housing department Municipal court  edit  Special purpose local governments  edit  School districts Main article  School district School districts are organized local entities providing public elementary  secondary  and or higher education which  under state law  have sufficient administrative and fiscal autonomy to qualify as separate governments  The category excludes dependent public school systems of county  municipal  township  or state governments  e g   school divisions    edit  Special districts Main article  Special purpose district Special districts are all organized local entities other than the four categories listed above  authorized by state law to provide only one or a limited number of designated functions  and with sufficient administrative and fiscal autonomy to qualify as separate governments  13  known by a variety of titles  including districts  authorities  boards  commissions  etc   as specified in the enabling state legislation  A special district may serve areas of multiple states if established by an interstate compact  Special districts are widely popular  have enjoyed  phenomenal growth  and  nearly tripled in number  from 1957 to 2007  14   edit  Councils or associations of governments It is common for residents of major U S  metropolitan areas to live under six or more layers of special districts as well as a town or city  and a county or township  15  In turn  a typical metro area often consists of several counties  several dozen towns or cities  and a hundred  or more  special districts  In one state  California  the fragmentation problem became so bad that in 1963 the California Legislature created Local Agency Formation Commissions in 57 of the state s 58 counties  that is  government agencies to supervise the orderly formation and development of other government agencies  One effect of all this complexity is that victims of government negligence occasionally sue the wrong entity and do not realize their error until the statute of limitations has run against them  16  Because efforts at direct consolidation have proven futile  U S  local government entities often form  councils of governments    metropolitan regional councils   or  associations of governments   These organizations serve as regional planning agencies and as forums for debating issues of regional importance  but are generally powerless relative to their individual members  17  Since the late 1990s   a movement  frequently called  New Regionalism   accepts the futility of seeking consolidated regional governments and aims instead for regional structures that do not supplant local governments   18   edit  Dillon s Rule Unlike the relationship of federalism that exists between the U S  government and the states  in which power is shared   municipal governments have no power except what is granted to them by their states  This legal doctrine was established by Judge John Forrest Dillon in 1872 and upheld by the U S  Supreme Court in 1907  In effect  state governments can place whatever restrictions they choose on their municipalities  including merging municipalities  controlling them directly  or abolishing them outright   as long as such rules don t violate the state s constitution  Dillon s Rule does not apply in all states of the United States  The constitutional provisions of some states provide specific rights for municipalities and counties  19  State constitutions which allow counties or municipalities to enact ordinances without the legislature s permission are said to provide home rule authority  20  New Jersey  for example  provides for home rule  21   edit  Institutions The nature of both county and municipal government varies not only between states  but also between different counties and municipalities within them  Local voters are generally free to choose the basic framework of government from a selection established by state law  1  In most cases both counties and municipalities have a governing council  governing in conjunction with a mayor or president  Alternatively  the institution may be of the council manager government form  run by a city manager under direction of the city council  In the past the municipal commission was also common  The ICMA has classified local governments into five common forms  mayor council  council manager  commission  town meeting  and representative town meeting  22  In addition to elections for a council or mayor  elections are often also held for positions such as local judges  the sheriff  head of the county s police department   and other offices   edit  Indian reservations While their territory nominally falls within the boundaries of individual states  Indian reservations actually function outside of their control  The reservation is usually controlled by an elected tribal council which provides local services   edit  Census of local government A census of all local governments in the country is performed every 5 years by the United States Census Bureau  in accordance with 13 USC 161  Governments in the United States 23  not including insular areas  Type Number Federal 1 State 50 County 3 034 Municipal  city  town  village

places  such as cities  towns  villages  boroughs  etc      note  New England towns and towns in New York and Wisconsin are classified as civil townships for census purposes   edit  Examples of local government in individual states The following sections provide details of the operation of local government in a selection of states  by way of example of the variety that exists across the country   edit  Alaska Alaska calls its county equivalents  boroughs   functioning similar to counties in the Lower 48  however  unlike any other state  not all of Alaska is subdivided into county equivalent boroughs  Owing to the state s low population density  most of the land is contained in what the state terms the Unorganized Borough which  as the name implies  has no intermediate borough government of its own  but is administered directly by the state government  Many of Alaska s boroughs are consolidated city borough governments  other cities exist both within organized boroughs and the Unorganized Borough   edit  California California has several different and overlapping forms of local government  Cities  counties  and the one consolidated city county can make ordinances  local laws   including the establishment and enforcement of civil and criminal penalties  A city council meeting in Fullerton  California The entire state is subdivided into 58 counties  e g   Los Angeles County   The only type of municipal entity is the city  e g   Los Angeles   although cities may either operate under  general law  or a custom drafted charter  California has never had villages  never really used townships  they were for surveying and judicial purposes only   and allows cities to call themselves  towns  if they wish  but the name  town  is purely cosmetic with no legal effect  As a result  California has several towns with large populations in the tens of thousands and several cities that are home to only a few hundred people  California cities are granted broad plenary powers under the California Constitution to assert jurisdiction over just about anything  and they cannot be abolished or merged without the consent of a majority of their inhabitants  For example  Los Angeles runs its own water and power utilities and its own elevator inspection department  while practically all other cities rely upon private utilities and the state elevator inspectors  San Francisco is unique in that it is the only consolidated city county in the state  The city of Lakewood  California pioneered the Lakewood Plan  a contract under which a city reimburses a county for performing services which are more efficiently performed on a countywide basis  Such contracts have become very popular throughout California and many other states  as they enable city governments to concentrate on particular local concerns like zoning  A city which contracts out most of its services  particularly law enforcement  is known as a contract city  There are also thousands of  special districts   which are areas with a defined territory in which a specific service is provided  such as schools or fire stations  These entities lack plenary power to enact laws  but do have the power to promulgate administrative regulations that often carry the force of law within land directly controlled by such districts  Many special districts  particularly those created to provide public transportation or education  have their own police departments  e g  Bay Area Rapid Transit District BART Police and University of California UC Police Department    edit  District of Columbia The District of Columbia is unique within the United States in that it is under the direct authority of the U S  Congress  rather than forming part of any state  Actual government has been delegated under the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to a city council which effectively also has the powers given to county or state governments in other areas  Under the act  the Council of the District of Columbia has the power to write laws  as a state s congress would  moving the bill to the mayor to sign into law  Following this  the United States Congress has the power to overthrow the law   edit  Georgia The state of Georgia is divided into 159 counties  the largest number of any state other than Texas   each of which has had home rule since at least 1980  This means that Georgia s counties not only act as units of state government  but also in much the same way as municipalities  All municipalities are classed as a  city   regardless of population size  For an area to be incorporated as a city special legislation has to be passed by the General Assembly  state legislature   typically the legislation requires a referendum amongst local voters to approve incorporation  to be passed by a simple majority  This most recently happened in 2005 and 2006 in several communities near Atlanta  Sandy Springs  a city of 85 000 bordering Atlanta to the north  incorporated in December 2005  One year later  Johns Creek  62 000  and Milton  20 000  incorporated  which meant that the entirety of north Fulton County was now municipalized  The General Assembly also approved a plan that would potentially establish two new cities in the remaining unincorporated portions of Fulton County south of Atlanta  South Fulton and Chattahoochee Hills  Chattahoochee Hills voted to incorporate in December 2007  South Fulton voted against incorporation  and is the only remaining unincorporated portion of Fulton County  City charters may be revoked either by the legislature or by a simple majority referendum of the city s residents  the latter last happened in 2004  in Lithia Springs  Revocation by the legislature last occurred in 1995  when dozens of cities were eliminated en masse for not having active governments  or even for not offering at least three municipal services required of all cities  New cities may not incorporate land less than 3 miles  4 8 km  from an existing city without approval from the General Assembly  The body approved all of the recent and upcoming creations of new cities in Fulton County  Three areas have a  consolidated city county  government  Columbus  since 1971  Athens  since 1991  and Augusta  since 1996   edit  Hawaii Hawaii is the only U S  state that has no incorporated municipalities  Instead it has four counties plus the  consolidated city county  of Honolulu  All communities are considered to be census designated places  with the exact boundaries being decided upon by co operative agreement between the Governor s office and the U S  Census Bureau  Kalawao County is the second smallest county in the United States  and is often considered part of Maui County   edit  Louisiana In Louisiana  counties are called parishes  likewise  the county seat is known as the parish seat  The difference in nomenclature does not reflect a fundamental difference in the nature of government  but is rather a reflection of the state s unique status as a former French colony  although a small number of other states once had parishes too    edit  New York Main article  Administrative divisions of New York  edit  Pennsylvania Pennsylvania has 67 counties  With the exception of Philadelphia and Allegheny  counties are governed by three to seven county commissioners who are elected every four years  the district attorney  county treasurer  sheriff  and certain classes of judge   judges of election   are also elected separately  Philadelphia has been a consolidated city county since 1952  Allegheny County has had a council chief executive government since 2000  while still retaining its townships  boroughs and cities  Each county is divided into municipal corporations  which can be one of four types  cities  boroughs  townships  and incorporated towns  The Commonwealth does not contain any unincorporated land that is not served by a local government  However  the US Postal Service has given names to places within townships that are not incorporated separately  For instance King of Prussia is a census designated place but has no local government of its own  It is rather contained within Upper Merion Township  governed by Upper Merion s commissioners  and considered to be a part of the township  Townships are divided into two classes  depending on their population size  Townships of the  First Class  have a board made up of five to nine commissioners who are elected either at large or for a particular ward  while those of the  Second Class  have a board of three to five supervisors who are elected at large  Both commissioners and supervisors serve a four year term  Some townships have adopted a home rule charter which allows them to choose their form of government  One example is Upper Darby Township  in Delaware County  which has chosen to have a  mayor council  system similar to that of a borough  Boroughs in Pennsylvania are governed by a  mayor council  system in which the mayor has only a few powers  usually that of overseeing the municipal police department  if the borough has one   while the borough council has very broad appointment and oversight  The council president  who is elected by the majority party every two years  is equivalent to the leader of a council in the United Kingdom  his or her powers operate within boundaries set by the state constitution and the borough s charter  A small minority of the boroughs have dropped the mayor council system in favor of the council manager system  in which the council appoints a borough manager to oversee the day to day operations of the borough  Bloomsburg is the Commonwealth s only incorporated town  McCandless is also officially referred to as a town  but it was incorporated as a township and now operates under a Home Rule Municipality Charter  Cities in Pennsylvania are divided into four classes  Class 1  Class 2  Class 2A  and Class 3  Class 3 cities  which are the smallest  have either a mayor council system or a council manager system like that of a borough  although the mayor or city manager has more oversight and duties compared to their borough counterparts  Pittsburgh and Scranton are the state s only Class 2 and Class 2A cities respectively  and have mayors with some veto power  but are otherwise still governed mostly by their city councils  Philadelphia is the Commonwealth s only Class 1 city  It has a government similar to that of the Commonwealth itself  with a mayor with strong appointment and veto powers and a 15 member city council that has both law making and confirmation powers  although unlike its state level counterpart  the General Assembly   it does not have the authority to override the mayor s veto  Certain types of legislation that can be passed by the city government require state legislation before coming into force  Unlike the other cities in Pennsylvania  the Philadelphia city government also has oversight of county government  and as such controls the budget for the district attorney  sheriff  and other county offices that have been retained from the county s one time separate existence  these offices are elected for separately than those for the city government proper   edit  Texas Texas has 254 counties  the most of any state  Each county is governed by a five member Commissioners Court  which consists of a County Judge  elected at large  and four Commissioners  elected from single member precincts   The County Judge has no veto authority over the decisions of the Court  s he has one vote along with the other Commissioners  In smaller counties  the County Judge also performs judicial functions  while in larger counties his her role is limited to the Court  Elections are held on a partisan basis  Counties have no home rule authority  their authority is strictly limited by the State  They operate in areas which are considered  unincorporated   those parts not within the territory of a city  Texas does not have townships  unless the city has contracted with the county for essential services  Cities may be either general law or home rule  Once a city reaches 5 000 in population  it may submit a ballot petition to create a  city charter  and operate under home rule status  they will maintain that status even if the population falls under 5 000  and may choose its own form of government  weak or strong mayor council  commission  council manager   Cities under general law status have only those powers authorized by the State  Annexation policies are highly dependent on whether the city is general law  annexation can only occur with the consent of the landowners  or home rule  no consent is required  but if the city fails to provide essential services  the landowners can petition for de annexation   and city boundaries can cross county ones  The city council can be elected either at large or from single member districts  Ballots are on a nonpartisan basis  though  generally  the political affiliation of the candidates is commonly known   With the exception of the Stafford Municipal School District  all 1 000  school districts in Texas are  independent  school districts  State law requires seven trustees  which can be elected either at large or from single member districts  Ballots are non partisan  The Texas Education Agency has state authority to order consolidation of school districts  generally for repeated failing performance as was the case with the Wilmer Hutchins Independent School District  In addition  state law allows the creation of special districts  such as hospital districts or water supply districts  Texas does not provide for independent cities nor for consolidated city county governments  However  local governments are free to enter into  interlocal agreements  with other ones  primarily for efficiency purposes  a common example is for cities and school districts in a county to contract with the county for property tax collection  thus  each resident receives only one property bill    edit  Virginia Main article  Political subdivisions of Virginia Virginia is divided into 95 counties and 39 cities  All cities are independent cities  which mean that they are separate from  and independent of  any county they may be near or within  Cities in Virginia thus are the equivalent of counties as they have no higher municipal government intervening between them and the state government  The equivalent in Virginia to what would normally be an incorporated city in any other state  e g  a municipality subordinate to a county  is a town  For example  there is a County of Fairfax as well as a totally independent City of Fairfax  which technically is not part of Fairfax County even though the City of Fairfax is the County seat of Fairfax County  Within Fairfax County  however  is the incorporated town of Vienna  which is part of Fairfax County   edit  Wisconsin Main article  Political subdivisions of Wisconsin
