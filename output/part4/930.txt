derived from the Greek Iouda smos  and ultimately from the Hebrew        Yehudah   Judah   1  2  in Hebrew            Yahedut  the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos 3   is the religion  philosophy  and way of life of the Jewish people  4  A monotheistic religion originating in the Hebrew Bible  also known as the Tanakh  and explored in later texts such as the Talmud  Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship God developed with the Children of Israel  5 Rabbinic Judaism holds that God revealed his laws and commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai in the form of both the Written and Oral Torah  6  This assertion was historically challenged by the Karaites  a movement that flourished in the medieval period  which retains several thousand followers today and maintains that only the Written Torah was revealed  7  In modern times  liberal movements such as Humanistic Judaism may be nontheistic  8  Judaism claims a historical continuity spanning more than 3 000 years  It is one of the oldest monotheistic religions  9  and the oldest to survive into the present day  10  The Hebrews   Israelites were already referred to as  Jews  in later books of the Tanakh such as the Book of Esther  with the term Jews replacing the title  Children of Israel   11  Judaism s texts  traditions and values strongly influenced later Abrahamic religions  including Christianity  Islam and the Baha i Faith  12  13  Many aspects of Judaism have also directly or indirectly influenced secular Western ethics and civil law  14  Jews are an ethnoreligious group 15  and include those born Jewish and converts to Judaism  In 2010  the world Jewish population was estimated at 13 4 million  or roughly 0 2  of the total world population  About 42  of all Jews reside in Israel and about 42  reside in the United States and Canada  with most of the remainder living in Europe  16  The largest Jewish religious movements are Orthodox Judaism  Hareidi Judaism and Modern Orthodox Judaism   Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism  A major source of difference between these groups is their approach to Jewish law  17  Orthodox Judaism maintains that the Torah and Jewish law are divine in origin  eternal and unalterable  and that they should be strictly followed  Conservative and Reform Judaism are more liberal  with Conservative Judaism generally promoting a more  traditional  interpretation of Judaism s requirements than Reform Judaism  A typical Reform position is that Jewish law should be viewed as a set of general guidelines rather than as a set of restrictions and obligations whose observance is required of all Jews  18  19  Historically  special courts enforced Jewish law  today  these courts still exist but the practice of Judaism is mostly voluntary  20  Authority on theological and legal matters is not vested in any one person or organization  but in the sacred texts and rabbis and scholars who interpret them  21  Contents 1 Defining character and principles of faith 1 1 Defining character 1 2 Core tenets 2 Jewish religious texts 2 1 Jewish legal literature 2 2 Jewish philosophy 2 3

with the Hebrew word zakhreinu   remember us Unlike other ancient Near Eastern gods  the Hebrew God is portrayed as unitary and solitary  consequently  the Hebrew God s principal relationships are not with other gods  but with the world  and more specifically  with the people He created  22  Judaism thus begins with an ethical monotheism  the belief that God is one  and concerned with the actions of humankind  23  According to the Hebrew Bible  God promised Abraham to make of his offspring a great nation  24  Many generations later  he commanded the nation of Israel to love and worship only one God  that is  the Jewish nation is to reciprocate God s concern for the world  25  He also commanded the Jewish people to love one another  that is  Jews are to imitate God s love for people  26  These commandments are but two of a large corpus of commandments and laws that constitute this covenant  which is the substance of Judaism  Thus  although there is an esoteric tradition in Judaism  Kabbalah   Rabbinic scholar Max Kadushin has characterized normative Judaism as  normal mysticism   because it involves every day personal experiences of God through ways or modes that are common to all Jews  27  This is played out through the observance of the halakhot and given verbal expression in the Birkat Ha Mizvot  the short blessings that are spoken every time a positive commandment is to be fulfilled  The ordinary  familiar  everyday things and occurrences  we have constitute occasions for the experience of God  Such things as one s daily sustenance  the very day itself  are felt as manifestations of God s loving kindness  calling for the Berakhot  Kedushah  holiness  which is nothing else than the imitation of God  is concerned with daily conduct  with being gracious and merciful  with keeping oneself from defilement by idolatry  adultery  and the shedding of blood  The Birkat Ha Mitzwot evokes the consciousness of holiness at a rabbinic rite  but the objects employed in the majority of these rites are non holy and of general character  while the several holy objects are non theurgic  And not only do ordinary things and occurrences bring with them the experience of God  Everything that happens to a man evokes that experience  evil as well as good  for a Berakah is said also at evil tidings  Hence  although the experience of God is like none other  the occasions for experiencing Him  for having a consciousness of Him  are manifold  even if we consider only those that call for Berakot  28  Whereas Jewish philosophers often debate whether God is immanent or transcendent  and whether people have free will or their lives are determined  Halakha is a system through which any Jew acts to bring God into the world  Ethical monotheism is central in all sacred or normative texts of Judaism  However  monotheism has not always been followed in practice  The Jewish Bible  Tanakh  records and repeatedly condemns the widespread worship of other gods in ancient Israel  29  In the Greco Roman era  many different interpretations of monotheism existed in Judaism  including the interpretations that gave rise to Christianity  30  Moreover  as a non creedal religion  some have argued that Judaism does not require one to believe in God  For some  observance of Jewish law is more important than belief in God per se  31  In modern times  some liberal Jewish movements do not accept the existence of a personified deity active in history  32  Core tenets Main article  Jewish principles of faith 13 Principles of Faith  I believe with perfect faith that the

core tenets  all of which have met with criticism  33  The most popular formulation is Maimonides  thirteen principles of faith  developed in the 12th century  According to Maimonides  any Jew who rejects even one of these principles would be considered an apostate and a heretic  34  35  Jewish scholars have held points of view diverging in various ways from Maimonides  principles  36  37  In Maimonides  time  his list of tenets was criticized by Hasdai Crescas and Joseph Albo  Albo and the Raavad argued that Maimonides  principles contained too many items that  while true  were not fundamentals of the faith  Along these lines  the ancient historian Josephus emphasized practices and observances rather than religious beliefs  associating apostasy with a failure to observe Jewish law and maintaining that the requirements for conversion to Judaism included circumcision and adherence to traditional customs  Maimonides  principles were largely ignored over the next few centuries  38  Later  two poetic restatements of these principles   Ani Ma amin  and  Yigdal   became integrated into many Jewish liturgies  39  citation needed  leading to their eventual near universal acceptance  40  41  In modern times  Judaism lacks a centralized authority that would dictate an exact religious dogma  21  42  Because of this  many different variations on the basic beliefs are considered within the scope of Judaism  36  Even so  all Jewish religious movements are  to a greater or lesser extent  based on the principles of the Hebrew Bible and various commentaries such as the Talmud and Midrash  Judaism also universally recognizes the Biblical Covenant between God and the Patriarch Abraham as well as the additional aspects of the Covenant revealed to Moses  who is considered Judaism s greatest prophet  36  43  44  45  46  In the Mishnah  a core text of Rabbinic Judaism  acceptance of the Divine origins of this covenant is considered an essential aspect of Judaism and those who reject the Covenant forfeit their share in the World to Come  47  Jewish religious texts The following is a basic  structured list of the central works of Jewish practice and thought  Tanakh 48   Hebrew Bible  and Rabbinic literature Mesorah Targum Jewish Biblical exegesis  also see Midrash below  Works of the Talmudic Era  classic rabbinic literature  Mishnah and commentaries Tosefta and the minor tractates Talmud  The Babylonian Talmud and commentaries Jerusalem Talmud and commentaries Midrashic literature  Halakhic Midrash Aggadic Midrash Halakhic literature Major Codes of Jewish Law and Custom Mishneh Torah and commentaries Tur and commentaries Shulchan Aruch and commentaries Responsa literature Jewish Thought and Ethics Jewish philosophy Kabbalah Hasidic works Musar literature and other works of Jewish ethics Siddur and Jewish liturgy Piyyut  Classical Jewish poetry  Jewish legal literature Main article  Halakha The basis of Jewish law and tradition  halakha  is the Torah  also known as the Pentateuch or the Five Books of Moses   According to rabbinic tradition there are 613 commandments in the Torah  Some of these laws are directed only to men or to women  some only to the ancient priestly groups  the Kohanim and Leviyim  members of the tribe of Levi   some only to farmers within the Land of Israel  Many laws were only applicable when the Temple in Jerusalem existed  and fewer than 300 of these commandments are still applicable today  While there have been Jewish groups whose beliefs were claimed to be based on the written text of the Torah alone  e g   the Sadducees  and the Karaites   most Jews believed in what they call the oral law  These oral traditions were transmitted by the Pharisee sect of ancient Judaism  and were later recorded in written form and expanded upon by the rabbis  Rabbinic Judaism  which derives from the Pharisees  has always held that the books of the Torah  called the written law  have always been transmitted in parallel with an oral tradition  To justify this viewpoint  Jews point to the text of the Torah  where many words are left undefined  and many procedures mentioned without explanation or instructions  this  they argue  means that the reader is assumed to be familiar with the details from other  i e   oral  sources  This parallel set of material was originally transmitted orally  and came to be known as  the oral law   By the time of Rabbi Judah haNasi  200 CE   after the destruction of Jerusalem  much of this material was edited together into the Mishnah  Over the next four centuries this law underwent discussion and debate in both of the world s major Jewish communities  in Israel and Babylonia   and the commentaries on the Mishnah from each of these communities eventually came to be edited together into compilations known as the two Talmuds  These have been expounded by commentaries of various Torah scholars during the ages  Halakha  the rabbinic Jewish way of life  then  is based on a combined reading of the Torah  and the oral tradition   the Mishnah  the halakhic Midrash  the Talmud and its commentaries  The Halakha has developed slowly  through a precedent based system  The literature of questions to rabbis  and their considered answers  is referred to as responsa  in Hebrew  Sheelot U Teshuvot   Over time  as practices develop  codes of Jewish law are written that are based on the responsa  the most important code  the Shulchan Aruch  largely determines Orthodox religious practice today  Jewish philosophy Main article  Jewish philosophy Jewish philosophy refers to the conjunction between serious study of philosophy and Jewish theology  Major Jewish philosophers include Solomon ibn Gabirol  Saadia Gaon  Judah Halevi  Maimonides  and Gersonides  Major changes occurred in response to the Enlightenment  late 18th to early 19th century  leading to the post Enlightenment Jewish philosophers  Modern Jewish philosophy consists of both Orthodox and non Orthodox oriented philosophy  Notable among Orthodox Jewish philosophers are Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler  Joseph B  Soloveitchik  and Yitzchok Hutner  Well known non Orthodox Jewish philosophers include Martin Buber  Franz Rosenzweig  Mordecai Kaplan  Abraham Joshua Heschel  Will Herberg  and Emmanuel L vinas  Related Topics Torah databases  electronic versions of

other situations where the same conditions are present in a more acute form A law operating in one situation will also be operative in another situation  if the text characterizes both situations in identical terms  A law that clearly expresses the purpose it was meant to serve will also apply to other situations where the identical purpose may be served  When a general rule is followed by illustrative particulars  only those particulars are to be embraced by it  A law that begins with specifying particular cases  and then proceeds to an all embracing generalization  is to be applied to particulars cases not specified but logically falling into the same generalization  A law that begins with a generalization as to its intended applications  then continues with the specification of particular cases  and then concludes with a restatement of the generalization  can be applied only to the particular cases specified  The rules about a generalization being followed or preceded by specifying particulars  rules 4 and 5  will not apply if it is apparent that the specification of the particular cases or the statement of the generalization is meant purely for achieving a greater clarity of language  A particular case already covered in a generalization that is nevertheless treated separately suggests that the same particularized treatment be applied to all other cases which are covered in that generalization  A penalty specified for a general category of wrong doing is not to be automatically applied to a particular case that is withdrawn from the general rule to be specifically prohibited  but without any mention of the penalty  A general prohibition followed by a specified penalty may be followed by a particular case  normally included in the generalization  with a modification in penalty  either toward easing it or making it more severe  A case logically falling into a general law but treated separately remains outside the provisions of the general law except in those instances where it is specifically included in them  Obscurities in Biblical texts may be cleared up from the immediate context or from subsequently occurring passages Contradictions in Biblical passages may be removed through the mediation of other passages   R  Ishmael 49  Orthodox and many other Jews do not believe that the revealed Torah consists solely of its written contents  but of its interpretations as well  The study of Torah  in its widest sense  to include both poetry  narrative  and law  and both the Hebrew Bible and the Talmud  is in Judaism itself a sacred act of central importance  For the sages of the Mishnah and Talmud  and for their successors today  the study of Torah was therefore not merely a means to learn the contents of God s revelation  but an end in itself  According to the Talmud  These are the things for which a person enjoys the dividends in this world while the principal remains for the person to enjoy in the world to come  they are  honoring parents  loving deeds of kindness  and making peace between one person and another  But the study of the Torah is equal to them all   Talmud Shabbat 127a   In Judaism   the study of Torah can be a means of experiencing God   50  Reflecting on the contribution of the Amoraim and Tanaim to contemporary Judaism  Professor Jacob Neusner observed  The rabbi s logical and rational inquiry is not mere logic chopping  It is a most serious and substantive effort to locate in trivialities the fundamental principles of the revealed will of God to guide and sanctify the most specific and concrete actions in the workaday world      Here is the mystery of Talmudic Judaism  the alien and remote conviction that the intellect is an instrument not of unbelief and desacralization but of sanctification   51  To study the Written Torah and the Oral Torah in light of each other is thus also to study how to study the word of God  In the study of Torah  the sages formulated and followed various logical and hermeneutical principles  According to David Stern  all Rabbinic hermeneutics rest on two basic axioms  first  the belief in the omnisignificance of Scripture  in the meaningfulness of its every word  letter  even  according to one famous report  scribal flourish  second  the claim of the essential unity of Scripture as the expression of the single divine will  52  These two principles make possible a great variety of interpretations  According to the Talmud  A single verse has several meanings  but no two verses hold the same meaning  It was taught in the school of R  Ishmael   Behold  My word is like fire declares the Lord and like a hammer that shatters rock   Jer 23 29   Just as this hammer produces many sparks  when it strikes the rock   so a single verse has several meanings    Talmud Sanhedrin 34a   Observant Jews thus view the Torah as dynamic  because it contains within it a host of interpretations 53  According to Rabbinic tradition  all valid interpretations of the written Torah were revealed to Moses at Sinai in oral form  and handed down from teacher to pupil  The oral revelation is in effect coextensive with the Talmud itself   When different rabbis forwarded conflicting interpretations  they sometimes appealed to hermeneutic principles to legitimize their arguments  some rabbis claim that these principles were themselves revealed by God to Moses at Sinai  54  Thus  Hillel called attention to seven commonly used in the interpretation of laws  baraita at the beginning of Sifra   R  Ishmael  thirteen  baraita at the beginning of Sifra  this collection is largely an amplification of that of Hillel   55 Eliezer b  Jose ha Gelili listed 32  largely used for the exegesis of narrative elements of Torah  All the hermeneutic rules scattered through the Talmudim and Midrashim have been collected by Malbim in Ayyelet ha Shachar  the introduction to his commentary on the Sifra  Nevertheless  R  Ishmael s 13 principles are perhaps the ones most widely known  they constitute an important  and one of Judaism s earliest  contributions to logic  hermeneutics  and jurisprudence  56 Judah Hadassi incorporated Ishmael s principles into Karaite Judaism in the 12th century  57  Today R  Ishmael s 13 principles are incorporated into the Jewish prayer book to be read by observant Jews on a daily basis  58  59  60  61  Jewish identity Origin of the term  Judaism  The term Judaism derives from the Latin Iudaismus  derived from the Greek            Iouda smos  and ultimately from the Hebrew        Yehudah   Judah   62  63  in Hebrew            Yahadut  It first appears as the Hellenistic Greek iudaismos in 2nd Maccabees in the 2nd century BCE  In the context of the age and period it held the meaning of seeking or forming part of a cultural entity  that of iudea  the Greek derivative of Persian Yehud  and can be compared with hellenismos  meaning acceptance of Hellenic cultural norms  the conflict between iudaismos and hellenismos lay behind the Maccabeean revolt and hence the invention of the term iudaismos   64  The earliest instance of the term in English  used to mean  the profession or practice of the Jewish religion  the religious system or polity of the Jews   is Robert Fabyan s The newe cronycles of Englande and of Fraunce a 1513  As an English translation of the Latin  the first instance in English is a 1611 translation of the Apocrypha Deuterocanon in Catholic and Orthodox Christianity   2 Macc  ii  21  Those that behaved themselues manfully to their honour for Iudaisme   65  Distinction between Jews as a people and Judaism According to Daniel Boyarin  the underlying distinction between religion and ethnicity is foreign to Judaism itself  and is one form of the dualism between spirit and flesh that has its origin in Platonic philosophy and that permeated Hellenistic Judaism  66  Consequently  in his view  Judaism does not fit easily into conventional Western categories  such as religion  ethnicity  or culture  Boyarin suggests that this in part reflects the fact that much of Judaism s more than 3 000 year history predates the rise of Western culture and occurred outside the West  that is  Europe  particularly medieval and modern Europe   During this time  Jews have experienced slavery  anarchic and theocratic self government  conquest  occupation  and exile  in the Diasporas  they have been in contact with and have been influenced by ancient Egyptian  Babylonian  Persian  and Hellenic cultures  as well as modern movements such as the Enlightenment  see Haskalah  and the rise of nationalism  which would bear fruit in the form of a Jewish state in the Levant  They also saw an elite convert to Judaism  the Khazars   only to disappear as the centers of power in the lands once occupied by that elite fell to the people of Rus and then the Mongols  Thus  Boyarin has argued that  Jewishness disrupts the very categories of identity  because it is not national  not genealogical  not religious  but all of these  in dialectical tension   67  In contrast to this point of view  practices such as Humanistic Judaism reject the religious aspects of Judaism  while retaining certain cultural traditions  Who is a Jew  Main article  Who is a Jew  According to traditional Jewish Law  a Jew is anyone born of a Jewish mother or converted to Judaism in accordance with Jewish Law  American Reform Judaism and British Liberal Judaism accept the child of one Jewish parent  father or mother  as Jewish if the parents raise the child with a Jewish identity  All mainstream forms of Judaism today are open to sincere converts  although conversion has traditionally been discouraged since the time of the Talmud  The conversion process is evaluated by an authority  and the convert is examined on his or her sincerity and knowledge  68  Converts are given the name  ben Abraham  or  bat Abraham    son or daughter of Abraham   Traditional Judaism maintains that a Jew  whether by birth or conversion  is a Jew forever  Thus a Jew who claims to be an atheist or converts to another religion is still considered by traditional Judaism to be Jewish  According to some sources  the Reform movement has maintained that a Jew who has converted to another religion is no longer a Jew  69  70  and the Israeli Government has also taken that stance after Supreme Court cases and statutes  71  However  the Reform movement has indicated that this is not so cut and dry  and different situations call for consideration and differing actions  For example  Jews who have converted under duress may be permitted to return to Judaism  without any action on their part but their desire to rejoin the Jewish community  and  A proselyte who has become an apostate remains  nevertheless  a Jew    p  100 106   72  The question of what determines Jewish identity in the State of Israel was given new impetus when  in the 1950s  David Ben Gurion requested opinions on mihu Yehudi   who is a Jew   from Jewish religious authorities and intellectuals worldwide in order to settle citizenship questions  This is still not settled  and occasionally resurfaces in Israeli politics  Jewish demographics Main article  Jewish population The total number of Jews worldwide is difficult to assess because the definition of  who is a Jew  is problematic  not all Jews identify themselves as Jewish  and some who identify as Jewish are not considered so by other Jews  According to the Jewish Year Book  1901   the global Jewish population in 1900 was around 11 million  The latest available data is from the World Jewish Population Survey of 2002 and the Jewish Year Calendar  2005   In 2002  according to the Jewish Population Survey  there were 13 3 million Jews around the world  The Jewish Year Calendar cites 14 6 million  Jewish population growth is currently near zero percent  with 0 3  growth from 2000 to 2001  Jewish religious movements Main article  Jewish religious movements Rabbinic Judaism Rabbinic Judaism  or in some Christian traditions  Rabbinism   Hebrew   Yahadut Rabanit                 has been the mainstream form of Judaism since the 6th century CE  after the codification of the Talmud  It is characterised by the belief that the Written Torah  Law  cannot be correctly interpreted without reference to the Oral Torah and by the voluminous literature specifying what behavior is sanctioned by the law  called halakha   the way    The Jewish Enlightenment of the late 18th century resulted in the division of Ashkenazi  Western  Jewry into religious movements or denominations  especially in North America and Anglophone countries  The main denominations today outside Israel  where the situation is rather different  are Orthodox  Conservative  and Reform  Orthodox Judaism holds that both the Written and Oral Torah were divinely revealed to Moses  and that the laws within it are binding and unchanging  Orthodox Jews generally consider commentaries on the Shulchan Aruch  a condensed codification of halakha that largely favored Sephardic traditions  to be the definitive codification of Jewish law  Orthodoxy places a high importance on Maimonides  13 principles as a definition of Jewish faith  Orthodoxy is often divided into Modern Orthodox Judaism and Haredi Judaism  Haredi Judaism is less accommodating to modernity and has less interest in non Jewish disciplines  and it may be distinguished from Modern Orthodox Judaism in practice by its styles of dress and more stringent practices  Subsets of Haredi Judaism include  Hasidic Judaism  which is rooted in the Kabbalah and distinguished by reliance on a Rebbe or religious teacher  and Sephardic Haredi Judaism  which emerged among Sephardic  Asian and North African  Jews in Israel  Conservative Judaism  known as Masorti outside the United States and Canada  is characterized by a commitment to traditional Jewish laws and customs  including observance of Shabbat and kashrut  a deliberately non fundamentalist teaching of Jewish principles of faith  a positive attitude toward modern culture  and an acceptance of both traditional rabbinic and modern scholarship when considering Jewish religious texts  Conservative Judaism teaches that Jewish law is not static  but has always developed in response to changing conditions  It holds that the Torah is a divine document written by prophets inspired by God and reflecting his will  but rejects the Orthodox position that it was dictated by God to Moses  73  74  Conservative Judaism holds that the Oral Law is divine and normative  but holds that both the Written and Oral Law may be interpreted by the rabbis to reflect modern sensibilities and suit modern conditions  Reform Judaism  called Liberal or Progressive Judaism in many countries  defines Judaism as a religion rather than as a race or culture  rejects most of the ritual and ceremonial laws of the Torah while observing moral laws  and emphasizes the ethical call of the Prophets  Reform Judaism has developed an egalitarian prayer service in the vernacular  along with Hebrew in many cases  and emphasizes personal connection to Jewish tradition  A Reform synagogue with mixed seating and equal participation of men and women Reconstructionist Judaism  like Reform Judaism  does not hold that Jewish law  as such  requires observance  but unlike Reform  Reconstructionist thought emphasizes the role of the community in deciding what observances to follow  Jewish Renewal is a recent North American movement which focuses on spirituality and social justice  but does not address issues of Jewish law  Men and women participate equally in prayer  Humanistic Judaism is a small non theistic movement centered in North America and Israel that emphasizes Jewish culture and history as the sources of Jewish identity  Jewish movements in Israel Main article  Religion in Israel Most Jewish Israelis classify themselves as  secular   hiloni    traditional   masorti    religious   dati  or Haredi  The term  secular  is more popular as a self description among Israeli families of western  European  origin  whose Jewish identity may be a very powerful force in their lives  but who see it as largely independent of traditional religious belief and practice  This portion of the population largely ignores organized religious life  be it of the official Israeli rabbinate  Orthodox  or of the liberal movements common to diaspora Judaism  Reform  Conservative   The term  traditional   masorti  is most common as a self description among Israeli families of  eastern  origin  i e   the Middle East  Central Asia  and North Africa   This term  as commonly used  has nothing to do with the official Masorti  Conservative  movement  There is a great deal of ambiguity in the ways  secular  and  traditional  are used in Israel  they often overlap  and they cover an extremely wide range in terms of ideology and religious observance  The term  Orthodox  is not popular in Israeli discourse  although the percentage of Jews who come under that category is far greater than in the diaspora  What would be called  Orthodox  in the diaspora includes what is commonly called dati  religious  or haredi  ultra Orthodox  in Israel  The former term includes what is called  Religious Zionism  or the  National Religious  community  as well as what has become known over the past decade or so as haredi leumi  nationalist haredi   or  Hardal   which combines a largely haredi lifestyle with nationalist ideology   Some people  in Yiddish  also refer to observant Orthodox Jews as frum  as opposed to frei  more liberal Jews    Haredi applies to a populace that can be roughly divided into three separate groups along both ethnic and ideological lines   1   Lithuanian   non hasidic  haredim of Ashkenazic origin   2  Hasidic haredim of Ashkenazic origin  and  3  Sephardic haredim  Alternative Judaism Main article  Alternative Judaism Karaite Judaism defines itself as the remnants of the non Rabbinic Jewish sects of the Second Temple period  such as the Sadducees  The Karaites   Scripturalists   accept only the Hebrew Bible and what they view as the Peshat   simple  meaning   they do not accept non biblical writings as authoritative  Some European Karaites do not see themselves as part of the Jewish community at all  although most do  The Samaritans  a very small community located entirely around Mount Gerizim in the Nablus Shechem region of the West Bank and in Holon  near Tel Aviv in Israel  regard themselves as the descendants of the Israelites of the Iron Age kingdom of Israel  Their religious practices are those of Judaism  but they regard only the written Torah as authoritative scripture  with a special regard also for the Samaritan Book of Joshua   Jewish observances Jewish ethics Main article  Jewish ethics Jewish ethics may be guided by halakhic traditions  by other moral principles  or by central Jewish virtues  Jewish ethical practice is typically understood to be marked by values such as justice  truth  peace  loving kindness  chesed   compassion  humility  and self respect  Specific Jewish ethical practices include practices of charity  tzedakah  and refraining from negative speech  lashon hara   Proper ethical practices regarding sexuality and many other issues are subjects of dispute among Jews  Prayers Main article  Jewish services A Yemenite Jew at morning prayers  wearing a kippah skullcap  prayer shawl and tefillin Traditionally  Jews recite prayers three times daily  Shacharit  Mincha  and Ma ariv with a fourth prayer  Mussaf added on Shabbat and holidays  At the heart of each service is the Amidah or Shemoneh Esrei  Another key prayer in many services is the declaration of faith  the Shema Yisrael  or Shema   The Shema is the recitation of a verse from the Torah  Deuteronomy 6 4   Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad  Hear  O Israel  The Lord is our God  The Lord is One   Most of the prayers in a traditional Jewish service can be recited in solitary prayer  although communal prayer is preferred  Communal prayer requires a quorum of ten adult Jews  called a minyan  In nearly all Orthodox and a few Conservative circles  only male Jews are counted toward a minyan  most Conservative Jews and members of other Jewish denominations count female Jews as well  In addition to prayer services  observant traditional Jews recite prayers and benedictions throughout the day when performing various acts  Prayers are recited upon waking up in the morning  before eating or drinking different foods  after eating a meal  and so on  The approach to prayer varies among the Jewish denominations  Differences can include the texts of prayers  the frequency of prayer  the number of prayers recited at various religious events  the use of musical instruments and choral music  and whether prayers are recited in the traditional liturgical languages or the vernacular  In general  Orthodox and Conservative congregations adhere most closely to tradition  and Reform and Reconstructionist synagogues are more likely to incorporate translations and contemporary writings in their services  Also  in most Conservative synagogues  and all Reform and Reconstructionist congregations  women participate in prayer services on an equal basis with men  including roles traditionally filled only by men  such as reading from the Torah  In addition  many Reform temples use musical accompaniment such as organs and mixed choirs  Religious clothing Further information  kippah  tzitzit  and tefillin A kippah  Hebrew           plural kippot  Yiddish            yarmulke  is a slightly rounded brimless skullcap worn by many Jews while praying  eating  reciting blessings  or studying Jewish religious texts  and at all times by some Jewish men  In Orthodox communities  only men wear kippot  in non Orthodox communities  some women also wear kippot  Kippot range in size from a small round beanie that covers only the back of the head  to a large  snug cap that covers the whole crown  Tzitzit  Hebrew            Ashkenazi pronunciation  tzitzis  are special knotted  fringes  or  tassels  found on the four corners of the tallit  Hebrew            Ashkenazi pronunciation  tallis   or prayer shawl  The tallit is worn by Jewish men and some Jewish women during the prayer service  Customs vary regarding when a Jew begins wearing a tallit  In the Sephardi community  boys wear a tallit from bar mitzvah age  In some Ashkenazi communities it is customary to wear one only after marriage  A tallit katan  small tallit  is a fringed garment worn under the clothing throughout the day  In some Orthodox circles  the fringes are allowed to hang freely outside the clothing  Tefillin  Hebrew              known in English as phylacteries  from the Greek word              meaning safeguard or amulet   are two square leather boxes containing biblical verses  attached to the forehead and wound around the left arm by leather straps  They are worn during weekday morning prayer by observant Jewish men and some Jewish women  75  A kittel  Yiddish         a white knee length overgarment  is worn by prayer leaders and some observant traditional Jews on the High Holidays  It is traditional for the head of the household to wear a kittel at the Passover seder in some communities  and some grooms wear one under the wedding canopy  Jewish males are buried in a tallit and sometimes also a kittel which are part of the tachrichim  burial garments   Jewish holidays Main article  Jewish holiday Jewish holidays are special days in the Jewish calendar  which celebrate moments in Jewish history  as well as central themes in the relationship between God and the world  such as creation  revelation  and redemption  Shabbat Main article  Shabbat Two braided Shabbat challahs placed under an embroidered challah cover at the start of the Shabbat meal Shabbat  the weekly day of rest lasting from shortly before sundown on Friday night to nightfall Saturday night  commemorates God s day of rest after six days of creation  76  It plays a pivotal role in Jewish practice and is governed by a large corpus of religious law  At sundown on Friday  the woman of the house welcomes the Shabbat by lighting two or more candles and reciting a blessing  The evening meal begins with the Kiddush  a blessing recited aloud over a cup of wine  and the Mohtzi  a blessing recited over the bread  It is customary to have challah  two braided loaves of bread  on the table  During Shabbat Jews are forbidden to engage in any activity that falls under 39 categories of melakhah  translated literally as  work   In fact the activities banned on the Sabbath are not  work  in the usual sense  They include such actions as lighting a fire  writing  using money and carrying in the public domain  The prohibition of lighting a fire has been extended in the modern era to driving a car  which involves burning fuel  and using electricity  Three pilgrimage festivals Main article  Shalosh regalim Sukkahs in Jerusalem Jewish holy days  chaggim   celebrate landmark events in Jewish history  such as the Exodus from Egypt and the giving of the Torah  and sometimes mark the change of seasons and transitions in the agricultural cycle  The three major festivals  Sukkot  Passover and Shavuot  are called  regalim   derived from the Hebrew word  regel   or foot   On the three regalim  it was customary for the Israelites to make pilgrimages to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the Temple  Passover  Pesach  is a week long holiday beginning on the evening of the 14th day of Nisan  the first month in the Hebrew calendar   that commemorates the Exodus from Egypt  Outside Israel  Passover is celebrated for eight days  In ancient times  it coincided with the barley harvest  It is the only holiday that centers on home service  the Seder  Leavened products  chametz  are removed from the house prior to the holiday  and are not consumed throughout the week  Homes are thoroughly cleaned to ensure no bread or bread by products remain  and a symbolic burning of the last vestiges of chametz is conducted on the morning of the Seder  Matzo is eaten instead of bread  Shavuot   Pentecost  or  Feast of Weeks   celebrates the revelation of the Torah to the Israelites on Mount Sinai  Also known as the Festival of Bikurim  or first fruits  it coincided in biblical times with the wheat harvest  Shavuot customs include all night study marathons known as Tikkun Leil Shavuot  eating dairy foods  cheesecake and blintzes are special favorites   reading the Book of Ruth  decorating homes and synagogues with greenery  and wearing white clothing  symbolizing purity  Sukkot   Tabernacles  or  The Festival of Booths   commemorates the Israelites  forty years of wandering through the desert on their way to the Promised Land  It is celebrated through the construction of temporary booths called sukkot  sing  sukkah  that represent the temporary shelters of the Israelites during their wandering  It coincides with the fruit harvest  and marks the end of the agricultural cycle  Jews around the world eat in sukkot for seven days and nights  Sukkot concludes with Shemini Atzeret  where Jews begin to pray for rain and Simchat Torah   Rejoicing of the Torah   a holiday which marks reaching the end of the Torah reading cycle and beginning all over again  The occasion is celebrated with singing and dancing with the Torah scrolls  Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah are technically considered to be a separate holiday and not a part of Sukkot  High Holy Days Main article  High Holidays Jews praying in a synagogue on Yom Kippur  from an 1878 painting by Maurycy Gottlieb The High Holidays  Yamim Noraim or  Days of Awe   revolve around judgment and forgiveness  Rosh Hashanah   also Yom Ha Zikkaron or  Day of Remembrance   and Yom Teruah  or  Day of the Sounding of the Shofar    Rosh Hashanah is the Jewish New Year  literally   head of the year    although it falls on the first day of the seventh month of the Hebrew calendar  Tishri  Rosh Hashanah marks the beginning of the 10 day period of atonement leading up to Yom Kippur  during which Jews are commanded to search their souls and make amends for sins committed  intentionally or not  throughout the year  Holiday customs include blowing the shofar  or ram s horn  in the synagogue  eating apples and honey  and saying blessings over a variety of symbolic foods  such as pomegranates  Yom Kippur    Day of Atonement   is the holiest day of the Jewish year  It is a day of communal fasting and praying for forgiveness for one s sins  Observant Jews spend the entire day in the synagogue  sometimes with a short break in the afternoon  reciting prayers from a special holiday prayerbook called a  Machzor   Many non religious Jews make a point of attending synagogue services and fasting on Yom Kippur  On the eve of Yom Kippur  before candles are lit  a prefast meal  the  seuda mafseket   is eaten  Synagogue services on the eve of Yom Kippur begin with the Kol Nidre prayer  It is customary to wear white on Yom Kippur  especially for Kol Nidre  and leather shoes are not worn  The following day  prayers are held from morning to evening  The final prayer service  called  Ne ilah   ends with a long blast of the shofar  Purim Main article  Purim Purim street scene in Jerusalem Purim  Hebrew          help info  P r m  lots   is a joyous Jewish holiday that commemorates the deliverance of the Persian Jews from the plot of the evil Haman  who sought to exterminate them  as recorded in the biblical Book of Esther  It is characterized by public recitation of the Book of Esther  mutual gifts of food and drink  charity to the poor  and a celebratory meal  Esther 9 22   Other customs include drinking wine  eating special pastries called hamantashen  dressing up in masks and costumes  and organizing carnivals and parties  Purim is celebrated annually on the 14th of the Hebrew month of Adar  which occurs in February or March of the Gregorian calendar  Hanukkah Main article  Hanukkah Hanukkah  Hebrew              dedication   also known as the Festival of Lights  is an eight day Jewish holiday that starts on the 25th day of Kislev  Hebrew calendar   The festival is observed in Jewish homes by the kindling of lights on each of the festival s eight nights  one on the first night  two on the second night and so on  The holiday was called Hanukkah  meaning  dedication   because it marks the re dedication of the Temple after its desecration by Antiochus IV Epiphanes  Spiritually  Hanukkah commemorates the  Miracle of the Oil   According to the Talmud  at the re dedication of the Temple in Jerusalem following the victory of the Maccabees over the Seleucid Empire  there was only enough consecrated oil to fuel the eternal flame in the Temple for one day  Miraculously  the oil burned for eight days   which was the length of time it took to press  prepare and consecrate new oil  Hanukkah is not mentioned in the Bible and was never considered a major holiday in Judaism  but it has become much more visible and widely celebrated in modern times  mainly because it falls around the same time as Christmas and has national Jewish overtones that have been emphasized since the establishment of the State of Israel  Other holidays Main article  Tisha B Av Main articles  Yom Hashoah and Yom Ha atzmaut Tisha B Av  Hebrew            or          the Ninth of Av   is a holiday of mourning and fasting commemorating the destruction of the First and Second Temples and the expulsion of the Jews from Spain  The modern holidays of Yom Ha shoah  Holocaust Remembrance Day  and Yom Ha atzmaut  Israeli Independence Day  commemorate the horrors of the Holocaust and the achievement of Israel independence  respectively  Torah readings Main article  Torah reading The core of festival and Shabbat prayer services is the public reading of the Torah  along with connected readings from the other books of the Tanakh  called Haftarah  Over the course of a year  the whole Torah is read  with the cycle starting over in the autumn  on Simchat Torah  Synagogues and religious buildings Main article  Synagogue Interior of the Esnoga synagogue in Amsterdam Synagogues are Jewish houses of prayer and study  They usually contain separate rooms for prayer  the main sanctuary   smaller rooms for study  and often an area for community or educational use  There is no set blueprint for synagogues and the architectural shapes and interior designs of synagogues vary greatly  The Reform movement mostly refer to their synagogues as temples  Some traditional features of a synagogue are  The ark  called aron ha kodesh by Ashkenazim and hekhal by Sephardim  where the Torah scrolls are kept  the ark is often closed with an ornate curtain  parochet  outside or inside the ark doors   The elevated reader s platform  called bimah by Ashkenazim and tebah by Sephardim   where the Torah is read  and services are conducted in Sephardi synagogues   The eternal light  ner tamid   a continually lit lamp or lantern used as a reminder of the constantly lit menorah of the Temple in Jerusalem The pulpit  or amud  a lectern facing the Ark where the hazzan or prayer leader stands while praying  In addition to synagogues  other buildings of significance in Judaism include yeshivas  or institutions of Jewish learning  and mikvahs  which are ritual baths  Dietary laws  kashrut Main article  Kashrut The Jewish dietary laws are known as kashrut  Food prepared in accordance with them is termed kosher  and food that is not kosher is also known as treifah or treif  People who observe these laws are colloquially said to be  keeping kosher   77  Many of the laws apply to animal based foods  For example  in order to be considered kosher  mammals must have split hooves and chew their cud  The pig is arguably the most well known example of a non kosher animal  78  Although it has split hooves  it does not chew its cud  79  For seafood to be kosher  the animal must have fins and scales  Certain types of seafood  such as shellfish  crustaceans  and eels  are therefore considered non kosher  Concerning birds  a list of non kosher species is given in the Torah  The exact translations of many of the species have not survived  and some non kosher birds  identities are no longer certain  However  traditions exist about the kashrut status of a few birds  For example  both chickens and turkeys are permitted in most communities  Other types of animals  such as amphibians  reptiles  and most insects  are prohibited altogether  77  In addition to the requirement that the species be considered kosher  meat and poultry  but not fish  must come from a healthy animal slaughtered in a process known as shechitah  Without the proper slaughtering practices even an otherwise kosher animal will be rendered treif  The slaughtering process is intended to be quick and relatively painless to the animal  Forbidden parts of animals include the blood  some fats  and the area in and around the sciatic nerve  77  Jewish law also forbids the consumption of meat and dairy products together  The waiting period between eating meat and eating dairy varies by the order in which they are consumed and by community  and can extend for up to six hours  Based on the Biblical injunction against cooking a kid in its mother s milk  this rule is mostly derived from the Oral Torah  the Talmud and Rabbinic law  77  Chicken and other kosher birds are considered the same as meat under the laws of kashrut  but the prohibition is Rabbinic  not Biblical  80  The use of dishes  serving utensils  and ovens may make food treif that would otherwise be kosher  Utensils that have been used to prepare non kosher food  or dishes that have held meat and are now used for dairy products  render the food treif under certain conditions  77  Furthermore  all Orthodox and some Conservative authorities forbid the consumption of processed grape products made by non Jews  due to ancient pagan practices of using wine in rituals  77  Some Conservative authorities permit wine and grape juice made without rabbinic supervision  81  The Torah does not give specific reasons for most of the laws of kashrut  77  However  a number of explanations have been offered  including maintaining ritual purity  teaching impulse control  encouraging obedience to God  improving health  reducing cruelty to animals and preserving the distinctness of the Jewish community  82  The various categories of dietary laws may have developed for different reasons  and some may exist for multiple reasons  For example  people are forbidden from consuming the blood of birds and mammals because  according to the Torah  this is where animal souls are contained  83  In contrast  the Torah forbids Israelites from eating non kosher species because  they are unclean   84  The Kabbalah describes sparks of holiness that are released by the act of eating kosher foods  but are too tightly bound in non kosher foods to be released by eating  85  Survival concerns supersede all the laws of kashrut  as they do for most halakhot  86  87  Laws of ritual purity Main article  Tumah The Tanakh describes circumstances in which a person who is tahor or ritually pure may become tamei or ritually impure  Some of these circumstances are contact with human corpses or graves  seminal flux  vaginal flux  menstruation  and contact with people who have become impure from any of these  88  89  In Rabbinic Judaism  Kohanim  members of the hereditary caste that served as priests in the time of the Temple  are mostly restricted from entering grave sites and touching dead bodies  90  Family purity Main article  Niddah An important subcategory of the ritual purity laws relates to the segregation of menstruating women  These laws are also known as niddah  literally  separation   or family purity  Vital aspects of halakha for traditionally observant Jews  they are not usually followed by Jews in liberal denominations  91  Especially in Orthodox Judaism  the Biblical laws are augmented by Rabbinical injunctions  For example  the Torah mandates that a woman in her normal menstrual period must abstain from sexual intercourse for seven days  A woman whose menstruation is prolonged must continue to abstain for seven more days after bleeding has stopped  88  The Rabbis conflated ordinary niddah with this extended menstrual period  known in the Torah as zavah  and mandated that a woman may not have sexual intercourse with her husband from the time she begins her menstrual flow until seven days after it ends  In addition  Rabbinical law forbids the husband from touching or sharing a bed with his wife during this period  Afterwards  purification can occur in a ritual bath called a mikveh  91  Traditional Ethiopian Jews keep menstruating women in separate huts and  similar to Karaite practice  do not allow menstruating women into their temples because of a temple s special sanctity  Emigration to Israel and the influence of other Jewish denominations have led to Ethiopian Jews adopting more normative Jewish practices  92  93  Life cycle events Life cycle events  or rites of passage  occur throughout a Jew s life that serve to strengthen Jewish identity and bind him her to the entire community  Brit milah   Welcoming male babies into the covenant through the rite of circumcision on their eighth day of life  The baby boy is also given his Hebrew name in the ceremony  A naming ceremony intended as a parallel ritual for girls  named zeved habat or brit bat  enjoys limited popularity  Bar mitzvah and Bat mitzvah   This passage from childhood to adulthood takes place when a female Jew is twelve and a male Jew is thirteen years old among Orthodox and some Conservative congregations  In the Reform movement  both girls and boys have their bat bar mitzvah at age thirteen  This is often commemorated by having the new adults  male only in the Orthodox tradition  lead the congregation in prayer and publicly read a  portion  of the Torah  Marriage   Marriage is an extremely important lifecycle event  A wedding takes place under a chupah  or wedding canopy  which symbolizes a happy house  At the end of the ceremony  the groom breaks a glass with his foot  symbolizing the continuous mourning for the destruction of the Temple  and the scattering of the Jewish people  Death and Mourning   Judaism has a multi staged mourning practice  The first stage is called the shiva  literally  seven   observed for one week  during which it is traditional to sit at home and be comforted by friends and family  the second is the shloshim  observed for one month  and for those who have lost one of their parents  there is a third stage  avelut yud bet chodesh  which is observed for eleven months  Community leadership Classical priesthood The role of the priesthood in Judaism has significantly diminished since the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE  when priests attended to the Temple and sacrifices  The priesthood is an inherited position  and although priests no longer have any but ceremonial duties  they are still honored in many Jewish communities  Many Orthodox Jewish communities believe that they will be needed again for a future Third Temple and need to remain in readiness for future duty  Kohen  priest    patrilineal descendant of Aaron  brother of Moses  In the Temple  the kohanim were charged with performing the sacrifices  Today  a Kohen is the first one called up at the reading of the Torah  performs the Priestly Blessing  as well as complying with other unique laws and ceremonies  including the ceremony of redemption of the first born  Levi  Levite    Patrilineal descendant of Levi the son of Jacob  In the Temple in Jerusalem  the levites sang Psalms  performed construction  maintenance  janitorial  and guard duties  assisted the priests  and sometimes interpreted the law and Temple ritual to the public  Today  a Levite is called up second to the reading of the Torah  Prayer leaders From the time of the Mishnah and Talmud to the present  Judaism has required specialists or authorities for the practice of very few rituals or ceremonies  A Jew can fulfill most requirements for prayer by himself  Some activities reading the Torah and haftarah  a supplementary portion from the Prophets or Writings   the prayer for mourners  the blessings for bridegroom and bride  the complete grace after meals require a minyan  the presence of ten Jews  The most common professional clergy in a synagogue are  Rabbi of a congregation   Jewish scholar who is charged with answering the legal questions of a congregation  This role requires ordination by the congregation s preferred authority  i e  from a respected Orthodox rabbi or  if the congregation is Conservative or Reform  from academic seminaries   A congregation does not necessarily require a rabbi  Some congregations have a rabbi but also allow members of the congregation to act as shatz or baal kriyah  see below   Hassidic Rebbe   rabbi who is the head of a Hasidic dynasty  Hazzan  note  the  h  denotes voiceless pharyngeal fricative   cantor    a trained vocalist who acts as shatz  Chosen for a good voice  knowledge of traditional tunes  understanding of the meaning of the prayers and sincerity in reciting them  A congregation does not need to have a dedicated hazzan  Jewish prayer services do involve two specified roles  which are sometimes  but not always  filled by a rabbi and or hazzan in many congregations  In other congregations these roles are filled on an ad hoc basis by members of the congregation who lead portions of services on a rotating basis  Shaliach tzibur or Shatz  leader literally  agent  or  representative  of the congregation  leads those assembled in prayer  and sometimes prays on behalf of the community  When a shatz recites a prayer on behalf of the congregation  he is not acting as an intermediary but rather as a facilitator  The entire congregation participates in the recital of such prayers by saying amen at their conclusion  it is with this act that the shatz s prayer becomes the prayer of the congregation  Any adult capable of reciting the prayers clearly may act as shatz  In Orthodox congregations and some Conservative congregations  only men can be prayer leaders  but all Progressive communities now allow women to serve in this function  The Baal kriyah or baal koreh  master of the reading  reads the weekly Torah portion  The requirements for being the baal kriyah are the same as those for the shatz  These roles are not mutually exclusive  The same person is often qualified to fill more than one role  and often does  Often there are several people capable of filling these roles and different services  or parts of services  will be led by each  Many congregations  especially larger ones  also rely on a  Gabbai  sexton    Calls people up to the Torah  appoints the shatz for each prayer session if there is no standard shatz  and makes certain that the synagogue is kept clean and supplied  The three preceding positions are usually voluntary and considered an honor  Since the Enlightenment large synagogues have often adopted the practice of hiring rabbis and hazzans to act as shatz and baal kriyah  and this is still typically the case in many Conservative and Reform congregations  However  in most Orthodox synagogues these positions are filled by laypeople on a rotating or ad hoc basis  Although most congregations hire one or more Rabbis  the use of a professional hazzan is generally declining in American congregations  and the use of professionals for other offices is rarer still  Specialized religious roles Dayan  judge    An ordained rabbi with special legal training who belongs to a beth din  rabbinical court   In Israel  religious courts handle marriage and divorce cases  conversion and financial disputes in the Jewish community  Mohel  circumciser    An expert in the laws of circumcision who has received training

sofer who is an expert in Hebrew calligraphy and has undergone rigorous training in the laws of writing sacred texts  Rosh yeshiva   A Torah scholar who runs a yeshiva  Mashgiach of a yeshiva   Depending on which yeshiva  might either be the person responsible for ensuring attendance and proper conduct  or even supervise the emotional and spiritual welfare of the students and give lectures on mussar  Jewish ethics   Mashgiach   Supervises manufacturers of kosher food  importers  caterers and restaurants to ensure that the food is kosher  Must be an expert in the laws of kashrut and trained by a rabbi  if not a rabbi himself  History Main article  Jewish history Origins Main article  Origins of Judaism Further information  Ancient Semitic religion Scenes from the Book of Esther decorate the Dura Europos synagogue dating from 244 CE At its core  the Tanakh is an account of the Israelites  relationship with God from their earliest history until the building of the Second Temple  c  535 BCE   Abraham is hailed as the first Hebrew and the father of the Jewish people  As a reward for his act of faith in one God  he was promised that Isaac  his second son  would inherit the Land of Israel  then called Canaan   Later  Jacob and his children were enslaved in Egypt  and God commanded Moses to lead the Exodus from Egypt  At Mount Sinai they received the Torah   the five books of Moses  These books  together with Nevi im and Ketuvim are known as Torah Shebikhtav as opposed to the Oral Torah  which refers to the Mishna and the Talmud  Eventually  God led them to the land of Israel where the tabernacle was planted in the city of Shiloh for over 300 years to rally the nation against attacking enemies  As time went on  the spiritual level of the nation declined to the point that God allowed the Philistines to capture the tabernacle  The people of Israel then told Samuel the prophet that they needed to be governed by a permanent king  and Samuel appointed Saul to be their King  When the people pressured Saul into going against a command conveyed to him by Samuel  God told Samuel to appoint David in his stead  The Western Wall in Jerusalem is a remnant of the wall encircling the Second Temple  The Temple Mount is the holiest site in Judaism  Once King David was established  he told the prophet Nathan that he would like to build a permanent temple  and as a reward for his actions  God promised David that he would allow his son  Solomon  to build the first permanent temple and the throne would never depart from his children  Rabbinic tradition holds that the details and interpretation of the law  which are called the Oral Torah or oral law  were originally an unwritten tradition based upon what God told Moses on Mount Sinai  However  as the persecutions of the Jews increased and the details were in danger of being forgotten  these oral laws were recorded by Rabbi Judah haNasi  Judah the Prince  in the Mishnah  redacted circa 200 CE  The Talmud was a compilation of both the Mishnah and the Gemara  rabbinic commentaries redacted over the next three centuries  The Gemara originated in two major centers of Jewish scholarship  Palestine and Babylonia  Correspondingly  two bodies of analysis developed  and two works of Talmud were created  The older compilation is called the Jerusalem Talmud  It was compiled sometime during the 4th century in Israel  The Babylonian Talmud was compiled from discussions in the houses of study by the scholars Ravina I  Ravina II  and Rav Ashi by 500 CE  although it continued to be edited later  Some critical scholars oppose the view that the sacred texts  including the Hebrew Bible  were divinely inspired  Many of these scholars accept the general principles of the documentary hypothesis and suggest that the Torah consists of inconsistent texts edited together in a way that calls attention to divergent accounts  94  95  96  Many suggest that during the First Temple period  the people of Israel believed that each nation had its own god  but that their god was superior to other gods  97  98  Some suggest that strict monotheism developed during the Babylonian Exile  perhaps in reaction to Zoroastrian dualism  99  In this view  it was only by the Hellenic period that most Jews came to believe that their god was the only god  and that the notion of a clearly bounded Jewish nation identical with the Jewish religion formed  100  John Day argues that the origins of biblical Yahweh  El  Asherah  and Ba al  may be rooted in earlier Canaanite religion  which was centered on a pantheon of gods much like the Greek Pantheon  101  Antiquity Main articles  Ancient Israel and Judah  Babylonian captivity  Hellenistic Judaism  Hasmonean Kingdom  Iudaea Province  and Bar Kokhba revolt The United Monarchy was established under Saul and continued under King David and Solomon with its capital in Jerusalem  After Solomon s reign the nation split into two kingdoms  the Kingdom of Israel  in the north  and the Kingdom of Judah  in the south   The Kingdom of Israel was conquered by the Assyrian ruler Sargon II in the late 8th century BCE with many people from the capital Samaria being taken captive to Media and the Khabur River valley  The Kingdom of Judah continued as an independent state until it was conquered by a Babylonian army in the early 6th century BCE  destroying the First Temple that was at the center of ancient Jewish worship  The Judean elite were exiled to Babylonia and this is regarded as the first Jewish Diaspora  Later many of them returned to their homeland after the subsequent conquest of Babylonia by the Persians seventy years later  a period known as the Babylonian Captivity  A new Second Temple was constructed  and old religious practices were resumed  During the early years of the Second Temple  the highest religious authority was a council known as the Great Assembly  led by Ezra of the Book of Ezra  Among other accomplishments of the Great Assembly  the last books of the Bible were written at this time and the canon sealed  Hellenistic Judaism spread to Ptolemaic Egypt from the 3rd century BCE  After the Great Revolt  66 73 CE   the Romans destroyed the Temple  Hadrian built a pagan idol on the Temple grounds and prohibited circumcision  these acts of ethnocide provoked the Bar Kokhba revolt 132 136 CE after which the Romans banned the study of the Torah and the celebration of Jewish holidays  and forcibly removed virtually all Jews from Judea  In 200 CE  however  Jews were granted Roman citizenship and Judaism was recognized as a religio licita   legitimate religion    until the rise of Gnosticism and Early Christianity in in the fourth century  Following the destruction of Jerusalem and the expulsion of the Jews  Jewish worship stopped being centrally organized around the Temple  prayer took the place of sacrifice  and worship was rebuilt around the community  represented by a minimum of ten adult men  and the establishment of the authority of rabbis who acted as teachers and leaders of individual communities  see Jewish diaspora   Historical Jewish groupings  to 1700  Around the 1st century CE there were several small Jewish sects  the Pharisees  Sadducees  Zealots  Essenes  and Christians  After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE  these sects vanished  Christianity survived  but by breaking with Judaism and becoming a separate religion  the Pharisees survived but in the form of Rabbinic Judaism  today  known simply as  Judaism    The Sadducees rejected the divine inspiration of the Prophets and the Writings  relying only on the Torah as divinely inspired  Consequently  a number of other core tenets of the Pharisees  belief system  which became the basis for modern Judaism   were also dismissed by the Sadducees   The Samaritans practiced a similar religion  which is traditionally considered separate from Judaism   Like the Sadducees who relied only on the Torah  some Jews in the 8th and 9th centuries rejected the authority and divine inspiration of the oral law as recorded in the Mishnah  and developed by later rabbis in the two Talmuds   relying instead only upon the Tanakh  These included the Isunians  the Yudganites  the Malikites  and others  They soon developed oral traditions of their own  which differed from the rabbinic traditions  and eventually formed the Karaite sect  Karaites exist in small numbers today  mostly living in Israel  Rabbinical and Karaite Jews each hold that the others are Jews  but that the other faith is erroneous  Over a long time  Jews formed distinct ethnic groups in several different geographic areas   amongst others  the Ashkenazi Jews  of central and Eastern Europe   the Sephardi Jews  of Spain  Portugal  and North Africa   the Beta Israel of Ethiopia  and the Yemenite Jews from the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula  Many of these groups have developed differences in their prayers  traditions and accepted canons  however these distinctions are mainly the result of their being formed at some cultural distance from normative  rabbinic  Judaism  rather than based on any doctrinal dispute  Persecutions Main articles  Persecution of Jews  Antisemitism  and History of antisemitism Antisemitism arose during the Middle Ages  in the form of persecutions  pogroms  forced conversion  expulsions  social restrictions and ghettoization  This was different in quality to any repressions of Jews in ancient times  Ancient repression was politically motivated and Jews were treated no differently than any other ethnic group would have been  With the rise of the Churches  attacks on Jews became motivated instead by theological considerations specifically deriving from Christian views about Jews and Judaism  102  Hasidism Main article  Hasidic Judaism Hasidic Judaism was founded by Yisroel ben Eliezer  1700 1760   also known as the Ba al Shem Tov  or Besht   It originated in a time of persecution of the Jewish people  when European Jews had turned inward to Talmud study  many felt that most expressions of Jewish life had become too  academic   and that they no longer had any emphasis on spirituality or joy  His disciples attracted many followers  they themselves established numerous Hasidic sects across Europe  Hasidic Judaism eventually became the way of life for many Jews in Europe  Waves of Jewish immigration in the 1880s carried it to the United States  The movement itself claims to be nothing new  but a refreshment of original Judaism  Or as some have put it   they merely re emphasized that which the generations had lost   103  Nevertheless  early on there was a serious schism between Hasidic and non Hasidic Jews  European Jews who rejected the Hasidic movement were dubbed by the Hasidim as Misnagdim   lit   opponents    Some of the reasons for the rejection of Hasidic Judaism were the overwhelming exuberance of Hasidic worship  its untraditional ascriptions of infallibility and alleged miracle working to their leaders  and the concern that it might become a messianic sect  Since then differences between the Hasidim and their opponents have slowly diminished and both groups are now considered part of Haredi Judaism  The Enlightenment and new religious movements Main articles  Haskalah and Jewish religious movements In the late 18th century CE  Europe was swept by a group of intellectual  social and political movements known as the Enlightenment  The Enlightenment led to reductions in the European laws that prohibited Jews to interact with the wider secular world  thus allowing Jews access to secular education and experience  A parallel Jewish movement  Haskalah or the  Jewish Enlightenment   began  especially in Central Europe and Western Europe  in response to both the Enlightenment and these new freedoms  It placed an emphasis on integration with secular society and a pursuit of non religious knowledge through reason  With the promise of political emancipation many Jews saw no reason to continue to observe Jewish law and increasing numbers of Jews assimilated into Christian Europe  Modern religious movements of Judaism all formed in reaction to this trend  In Central Europe  followed by Great Britain and the United States  Reform Judaism and Liberal Judaism developed  relaxing legal obligations  especially those that limited Jewish relations with non Jews   emulating Protestant decorum in prayer  and emphasizing the ethical values of Judaism s Prophetic tradition  Modern Orthodox Judaism developed in reaction to Reform Judaism  by leaders who argued that Jews could participate in public life as citizens equal to Christians  while maintaining the observance of Jewish law  Meanwhile  in the United States  wealthy Reform Jews helped European scholars  who were Orthodox in practice but critical  and skeptical  in their study of the Bible and Talmud  to establish a seminary to train rabbis for immigrants from Eastern Europe  These left wing Orthodox rabbis were joined by right wing Reform rabbis who felt that Jewish law should not be entirely abandoned  to form the Conservative movement  Orthodox Jews who opposed the Haskalah formed Haredi Orthodox Judaism  After massive movements of Jews following The Holocaust and the creation of the state of Israel  these movements have competed for followers from among traditional Jews in or from other countries  Spectrum of observance Judaism has spread to all corners of the world  Seen here is a synagogue in downtown Mumbai  Countries such as the United States  Israel  Canada  United Kingdom  Argentina and South Africa contain large Jewish populations  Jewish religious practice varies widely through all levels of observance  According to the 2001 edition of the National Jewish Population Survey  in the United States  Jewish community the world s second largest 4 3 million Jews out of 5 1 million had some sort of connection to the religion  Of that population of connected Jews  80  participated in some sort of Jewish religious observance  but only 48  belonged to a synagogue  and fewer than 16  attend regularly  104  Birth rates for American Jews have dropped from 2 0 to 1 7  105   Replacement rate is 2 1   Intermarriage rates range from 40 50  in the US  and only about a third of children of intermarried couples are raised as Jews  Due to intermarriage and low birth rates  the Jewish population in the US shrank from 5 5 million in 1990 to 5 1 million in 2001  This is indicative of the general population trends among the Jewish community in the Diaspora  but a focus on total population obscures growth trends in some denominations and communities  such as Haredi Judaism  The Baal teshuva movement is a movement of Jews

See also  History of the Jews under Muslim rule and Islam and antisemitism The relationship between Islam and Judaism is special and close  Both religions claim to arise from the patriarch Abraham  and are therefore considered Abrahamic religions  As fellow monotheists  Muslims view Jews as  people of the book   a term that Jews have subsequently adopted as a way of describing their own connection to the Torah and other holy texts  106  In turn  many Jews maintain that Muslims adhere to the Seven Laws of Noah  Thus  Judaism views Muslims as righteous people of God  107  Jews have interacted with Muslims since the 7th century  when Islam originated and spread in the Arabian peninsula  and many aspects of Islam s core values  structure  jurisprudence and practice are based on Judaism  108  109 Muslim culture and philosophy have heavily influenced practitioners of Judaism in the Islamic world  110  In premodern Muslim countries  Jews rarely faced martyrdom  exile or forcible conversion  and were mostly free in their choice of residence and profession  111  Indeed  the years 712 to 1066 CE under the Ummayad and the Abbasid rulers have been called the Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain  Non Muslim monotheists living in these countries  including Jews  were known as dhimmis  Dhimmis were allowed to practice their religion and to administer their internal affairs  but they were subject to certain restrictions that were not imposed on Muslims  112  For example  they had to pay the jizya  a per capita tax imposed on free adult non Muslim males  112  and they were also forbidden to bear arms or testify in court cases involving Muslims  113  Many of the laws regarding dhimmis were highly symbolic  For example  dhimmis in some countries were required to wear distinctive clothing  a practice not found in either the Qur an or hadiths but invented in early medieval Baghdad and inconsistently enforced  114  Jews in Muslim countries were not entirely free from persecution for example  many were killed  exiled or forcibly converted in the 12th century  in Persia and by the rulers of the Almohad dynasty in North Africa and Al Andalus  115  At times  Jews were also restricted in their choice of residence in Morocco  Jews were confined to walled quarters  mellahs  beginning in the 15th century and increasingly since the early 19th century  116  In the late 20th century  Jews were expelled from nearly all the Arab countries  Most have chosen to live in Israel  Today  antisemitic themes have become commonplace in the propaganda of Arab Islamic movements such as Hizbullah and Hamas  in the pronouncements of various agencies of the Islamic Republic of Iran  and even in the newspapers and other publications of Refah Partisi  117  Syncretic movements incorporating Judaism There are some movements that combine elements of Judaism with those of other religions  The most well known of these is Messianic Judaism  which arose in the 1960s  118  119  120  121  It blends evangelical Christian theology with elements of Jewish terminology and ritual  121  122  123  124  125  The movement states that Jesus is part of the Trinity  126  127  and salvation is only achieved through acceptance of Jesus as one s savior  128  Some members of the movement are ethnically Jewish  and some of them argue that Messianic Judaism is a sect of Judaism  129  Jewish organizations and religious movements reject this  stating that Messianic Judaism is a Christian sect  130  The most controversial of these groups is the American organization Jews for Jesus  which actively proselytizes ethnic Jews through numerous missionary campaigns in major American cities  Other examples of syncretism include Judeo Paganists  a loosely organized set of Jews who incorporate pagan or Wiccan beliefs with some Jewish religious practices  like Messianic Judaism  Jewish Buddhists  another loosely organized group that incorporates elements of Asian spirituality in their faith  and some Renewal Jews who borrow freely and openly from Buddhism  Sufism  Native American religion  and other faiths  The Kabbalah Centre  which employs teachers from multiple religions  is a New Age movement that claims to popularize the kabbalah  the Jewish esoteric tradition  See also Judaism portal Religion portal Book  Abrahamic religions Book  Judaism Wikipedia books are

however  was predicated  and still is  on the dualism of the flesh and the spirit  such that while the body is particular  marked through practice as Jew or Greek  and through anatomy as male or female  the spirit is universal  Paul did not  however  reject the body as did  for instance  the gnostics but rather promoted a system whereby the body had its place  albeit subordinated to the spirit  Paul s anthropological dualism was matched by a hermeneutical dualism as well  Just as the human being is divided into a fleshy and a spiritual component  so also is language itself  It is composed of outer  material signs and inner  spiritual significations  When this is applied to the religious system that Paul inherited  the physical  fleshy signs of the Torah  of historical Judaism

evangelical form  Missionaries such as the Southern Baptist Robert Lindsey noted that for Israeli Jews  the term nozrim   Christians  in Hebrew  meant  almost automatically  an alien  hostile religion  Because such a term made it nearly impossible to convince Jews that Christianity was their religion  missionaries sought a more neutral term  one that did not arouse negative feelings  They chose Meshichyim  Messianic  to overcome the suspicion and antagonism of the term nozrim  Meshichyim as a term also had the advantage of emphasizing messianism as a major component of the Christian evangelical belief that the missions and communities of Jewish converts to Christianity propagated  It conveyed the sense of a new  innovative religion rather that sic  an old  unfavorable one  The term was used in reference to those Jews who accepted Jesus as their personal savior  and did not apply to Jews accepting Roman Catholicism who in Israel have called themselves Hebrew Christians  The term Messianic Judaism was adopted in the United States in the early 1970s by those converts to evangelical Christianity who advocated a more assertive attitude on the part of converts towards their Jewish roots and heritage      Cohn Sherbok  Dan  2000    Messianic Jewish mission   Messianic Judaism  London  Continuum International Publishing Group  p  179  ISBN 9780826454584  OCLC 42719687

offspring of the missionary movement  and the ties would never be broken  The rise of Messianic Judaism was  in many ways  a logical outcome of the ideology and rhetoric of the movement to evangelize the Jews as well as its early sponsorship of various forms of Hebrew Christian expressions  The missions have promoted the message that Jews who had embraced Christianity were not betraying their heritage or even their faith but were actually fulfilling their true Jewish selves by becoming Christians  The missions also promoted the dispensationalist idea that the Church equals the body of the true Christian believers and that Christians were defined by their acceptance of Jesus as their personal Savior and not by their affiliations with specific denominations and particular liturgies or modes of prayer  Missions had been using Jewish symbols in their buildings and literature and called their centers by Hebrew names such as Emanuel or Beth Sar Shalom  Similarly  the missions  publications featured Jewish religious symbols and practices such as the lighting of a menorah  Although missionaries to the Jews were alarmed when they first confronted the more assertive and independent movement of Messianic Judaism  it was they who were responsible for its conception and indirectly for its birth  The ideology  rhetoric  and symbols they had promoted for generations provided the background for the rise of a new movement that missionaries at first rejected as going too far but later accepted and even embraced       What are the Standards of the UMJC    FAQ  Union

obey a commandment of God if they first do not love God  and we love God by following his Messiah  Without first accepting Yeshua as the King and thus obeying Him  then getting circumcised for the purpose of Jewish conversion only gains you access to the Jewish community  It means nothing when it comes to inheriting a place in the World to Come    Getting circumcised apart from desiring to be obedient to HaShem  and apart from accepting Yeshua as your King  is nothing but a surgical procedure  or worse  could lead to you believe that Jewish identity grants you a portion in the World to

are a male  is to get circumcised in fulfillment of the commandment regarding circumcision  Circumcision is not an absolute requirement of being a Covenant member  that is  being made righteous before HaShem  and thus obtaining eternal life   but it is a requirement of obedience to God s commandments  because circumcision is commanded for those who are of the seed of Abraham  whether born into the family  adopted  or converted    If after reading all of this you understand what circumcision is  and that is an act of obedience  rather than an act of gaining favor before HaShem for the purpose of receiving eternal life  then if you are male believer in Yeshua the Messiah for the redemption from death  the consequence of your sin of rebellion against Him  then pursue circumcision  and thus
