an individual  business organization  or other legal entity  to identify that the products or services with which the trademark appears originate from a unique source  and to distinguish its products or services from those of other entities  A trademark may be designated by the following symbols     for an unregistered trade mark  that is  a mark used to promote or brand goods     for an unregistered service mark  that is  a mark used to promote or brand services     for a registered trademark or service mark  A trademark is typically a name  word  phrase  logo  symbol  design  image  or a combination of these elements  2  There is also a range of non conventional trademarks comprising marks which do not fall into these standard categories  such as those based on color  smell  or sound  The owner of a registered trademark may commence legal proceedings for trademark infringement to prevent unauthorized use of that trademark  However  in some countries unregistered rights in a sign may also be enforced  These are often known as  common law  rights  An unregistered sign is usually only protected within the geographical area within which it has been used or in geographical areas into which it may be reasonably expected to expand  The term trademark is also used informally to refer to any distinguishing attribute by which an individual is readily identified  such as the well known characteristics of celebrities  When a trademark is used in relation to services rather than products  it may sometimes be called a service mark  particularly in the United States  2

function of a trademark is to exclusively identify the commercial source or origin of products or services  such that a trademark  properly called  indicates source or serves as a badge of origin  In other words  trademarks serve to identify a particular business as the source of goods or services  The use of a trademark in this way is known as trademark use  Certain exclusive rights attach to a registered mark  which can be enforced by way of an action for trademark infringement  while in some countries unregistered trademark rights can be enforced pursuant to the common law tort of passing off  It should be noted that trademark rights generally arise out of the use or to maintain exclusive rights over that sign in relation to certain products or services  assuming there are no other trademark objections  Different goods and services have been classified by the International  Nice  Classification of Goods and Services into 45 Trademark Classes  1 to 34 cover goods  and 35 to 45 services   The idea of this system is to specify and limit the extension of the intellectual property right by determining which goods or services are covered by the mark  and to unify classification systems around the world   edit  History Bass Brewery s logo became the first image to be registered as a trademark in 1875 In trademark treatises it is usually reported that blacksmiths who made swords in the Roman Empire are thought of as being the first users of trademarks  3  Other notable trademarks that have been used for a long time include L wenbr u  which claims use of its lion mark since 1383  4  and Stella Artois  which claims use since 1366  citation needed  Registered trademarks involve registering the trademark with the government  The oldest registered trademarks in various countries include  United Kingdom  1876   The Bass Brewery s Red Triangle for ale was the first trademark to be registered under the Trade Mark Registration Act 1875  5  United States  1884   A picture of Samson wrestling a lion was registered to J P  Tolman Company  6  In 1980  there were fewer than ten thousand registered high tech trademarks in the United States  In 2011  there are more than 300 000  7   edit  Symbols The two symbols associated with U S  trademarks    the trademark symbol  and    the registered trademark symbol  represent the status of a mark and accordingly its level of protection  While   can be used with any common law usage of a mark    may only be used by the owner of a mark following registration with the relevant national authority  such as the U S  Patent and Trademark Office  USPTO or PTO   The proper manner to display either symbol is immediately following the mark in superscript style   edit  Terminology Approximate drawing of Burberry check pattern  The pattern is a registered trademark of Burberry Ltd  Terms such as  mark    brand  and  logo  are sometimes used interchangeably with  trademark    Trademark   however  also includes any device  brand  label  name  signature  word  letter  numerical  shape of goods  packaging  colour or combination of colours  smell  sound  movement or any combination thereof which is capable of distinguishing goods and services of one business from those of others  It must be capable of graphical representation and must be applied to goods or services for which it is registered  Specialized types of trademark include certification marks  collective trademarks and defensive trademarks  A trademark which is popularly used to describe a product or service  rather than to distinguish the product or services from those of third parties  is sometimes known as a genericized trademark  If such a mark becomes synonymous with that product or service to the extent that the trademark owner can no longer enforce its proprietary rights  the mark becomes generic   edit  Registration  Wikipedia  is a registered trademark of Wikimedia Foundation  Inc  The law considers a trademark to be a form of property  Proprietary rights in relation to a trademark may be established through actual use in the marketplace  or through registration of the mark with the trademarks office  or  trademarks registry   of a particular jurisdiction  In some jurisdictions  trademark rights can be established through either or both means  Certain jurisdictions generally do not recognize trademarks rights arising through use  If trademark owners do not hold registrations for their marks in such jurisdictions  the extent to which they will be able to enforce their rights through trademark infringement proceedings will therefore be limited  In cases of dispute  this disparity of rights is often referred to as  first to file  as opposed to  first to use   Other countries such as Germany offer a limited amount of common law rights for unregistered marks where to gain protection  the goods or services must occupy a highly significant position in the marketplace   where this could be 40  or more market share for sales in the particular class of goods or services  In the United States the registration process entails several steps prior to a trademark receiving its Certificate of Registration  8  First  an Applicant  the person or persons applying for the registration  files an application to register the respective trademark  The application is then placed in line in the order it was received to be examined by an examining attorney for the U S  Patent and Trademark Office  Second  following a period of anywhere from three to six months the application is reviewed by an examining attorney to make sure it complies with all requirements in order to be entitled to registration  9  This review includes procedural matters such as making sure the applicant s goods or services are identified properly  It also includes more substantive matters such as making sure the applicant s mark is not merely descriptive or likely to cause confusion with a pre existing applied for or registered mark  10  If the application runs afoul of any requirement  the examining attorney will issue an office action requiring the applicant to address certain issues or refusals prior to registration of the mark  Third  and after the examination of the mark has concluded with no issues to be addressed or an applicant has responded adequately to an examining attorney s concerns  the application will be published for opposition  During this 30 day period third parties who may be affected by the registration of the trademark may step forward to file an Opposition Proceeding to stop the registration of the mark  If an Opposition proceeding is filed it institutes a case before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to determine both the validity of the grounds for the opposition as well as the ability of the applicant to register the mark at issue  11  Fourth  provided that no third party opposes the registration of the mark during the opposition period or the opposition is ultimately decided in the applicant s favor the mark will be registered in due course  Outside of the United States the registration process is substantially similar to that found in the U S  save for one notable exception in many countries  registration occurs prior to the opposition proceeding  In short  once an application is reviewed by an examiner and found to be entitled to registration a registration certificate is issued subject to the mark being open to opposition for a period of typically 6 months from the date of registration  A registered trademark confers a bundle of exclusive rights upon the registered owner  including the right to exclusive use of the mark in relation to the products or services for which it is registered  The law in most jurisdictions also allows the owner of a registered trademark to prevent unauthorized use of the mark in relation to products or services which are identical or  colourfully  similar to the  registered  products or services  and in certain cases  prevent use in relation to entirely dissimilar products or services  The test is always whether a consumer of the goods or services will be confused as to the identity of the source or origin  An example may be a very large multinational brand such as  Sony  where a non electronic product such as a pair of sunglasses might be assumed to have come from Sony Corporation of Japan despite not being a class of goods that Sony has rights in  Once trademark rights are established in a particular jurisdiction  these rights are generally only enforceable in that jurisdiction  a quality which is sometimes known as territoriality  However  there is a range of international trademark laws and systems which facilitate the protection of trademarks in more than one jurisdiction  see International trademark laws below    edit  Search In the United States  the USPTO maintains a database of registered trademarks  The database is open to the public  however a licensed attorney may be required to interpret the search results  Furthermore as trademarks are governed by federal law  state law  and common law  a thorough search as to the availability of a mark is very important  In the United States  obtaining a trademark search and relying upon the results of an opinion issued by an attorney may insulate a trademark user from being required to pay treble damages and attorney s fees in a trademark infringement case as it demonstrates that the trademark user performed due diligence and was using the mark in good faith  The USPTO internally captures more information about trademarks than what they publicly disclose on their official search website  For example  the USPTO collects information about what exactly is shown inside every logo trademark filing  Trademarks may also be searched on third party databases  such as LexisNexis  Dialog  Compu Mark and Corsearch  In Europe and if a community trademark has to be filed  searches have to be conducted with the OHIM  Community Trademark Office  and with the various national offices  An alternative solution is to conduct a trademark search within private databases   edit  Ability to register In most systems  a trademark can be registered if it is able to distinguish the goods or services of a party  will not confuse consumers about the relationship between one party and another  and will not otherwise deceive consumers with respect to the qualities of the product   edit  Distinctive character Main article  Trademark distinctiveness  edit  Maintaining rights Trademarks rights must be maintained through actual lawful use of the trademark  These rights will cease if a mark is not actively used for a period of time  normally 5 years in most jurisdictions  In the case of a trademark registration  failure to actively use the mark in the lawful course of trade  or to enforce the registration in the event of infringement  may also expose the registration itself to become liable for an application for the removal from the register after a certain period of time on the grounds of  non use   It is not necessary for a trademark owner to take enforcement action against all infringement if it can be shown that the owner perceived the infringement to be minor and inconsequential  This is designed to prevent owners from continually being tied up in litigation for fear of cancellation  An owner can at any time commence action for infringement against a third party as long as it had not previously notified the third party of its discontent following third party use and then failed to take action within a reasonable period of time  called acquiescence   The owner can always reserve the right to take legal action until a court decides that the third party had gained notoriety which the owner  must  have been aware of  It will be for the third party to prove their use of the mark is substantial as it is the onus of a company using a mark to check they are not infringing previously registered rights  In the US  owing to the overwhelming number of unregistered rights  trademark applicants are advised to perform searches not just of the trademark register but of local business directories and relevant trade press  Specialized search companies perform such tasks prior to application  All jurisdictions with a mature trademark registration system provide a mechanism for removal in the event of such non use  which is usually a period of either three or five years  The intention to use a trademark can be proven by a wide range of acts as shown in the Wooly Bull and Aston v Harlee cases  In the US  failure to use a trademark for this period of time  aside from the corresponding impact on product quality  will result in abandonment of the mark  whereby any party may use the mark  An abandoned mark is not irrevocably in the public domain  but may instead be re registered by any party which has re established exclusive and active use  and must be associated or linked with the original mark owner  If a court rules that a trademark has become generic through common use  such that the mark no longer performs the essential trademark function and the average consumer no longer considers that exclusive rights attach to it   the corresponding registration may also be ruled invalid  For examples  see trademark distinctiveness  Unlike other forms of intellectual property  such as patents and copyrights   a registered trademark can  theoretically  last forever  So long as a trademark s use is continuous a trademark holder may keep the mark registered with the U S  Patent and Trademark Office by filing Section 8 Affidavit s  of Continuous Use as well as Section 9 Applications for renewal  as required  Specifically  once registered with the U S  Patent and Trademark Office the owner of a trademark is required to file a Section 8 Affidavit of Continuous Use to maintain the registration between the 5th and 6th year anniversaries of the registration of the mark or during the 6 month grace period following the 6th year anniversary of the registration  12  Note  if the Section 8 Affidavit is filed during the 6 month grace period additional fees to file the Affidavit with the U S  Patent and Trademark Office will apply  13  In addition to requirement above  US trademark registrations are also required to be renewed on or about every 10 year anniversary of the registration of the trademark  The procedure for 10 year renewals is somewhat different from that for the 5th 6th year renewal  In brief  registrants are required to file both a Section 8 Affidavit of Continuous Use as well as a Section 9 Application for Renewal every ten years to maintain their registration  14   edit  Enforcing rights This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   February 2008  The extent to which a trademark owner may prevent unauthorized use of trademarks which are the same as or similar to its trademark depends on various factors such as whether its trademark is registered  the similarity of the trademarks involved  the similarity of the products or services involved  and whether the owner s trademark is well known or  under U S  law relating to trademark dilution  famous  If a trademark has not been registered  some jurisdictions  especially Common Law countries  offer protection for the business reputation or goodwill which attaches to unregistered trademarks through the tort of passing off  Passing off may provide a remedy in a scenario where a business has been trading under an unregistered trademark for many years  and a rival business starts using the same or a similar mark  If a trademark has been registered  then it is much easier for the trademark owner to demonstrate its trademark rights and to enforce these rights through an infringement action  Unauthorized use of a registered trademark need not be intentional in order for infringement to occur  although damages in an infringement lawsuit will generally be greater if there was an intention to deceive  For trademarks which are considered to be well known  infringing use may occur where the use occurs in relation to products or services which are not the same as or similar to the products or services in relation to which the owner s mark is registered  A growing area of law relating to the enforcement of trademark rights is secondary liability  which allows for the imputation of liability to one who has not acted directly to infringe a trademark but whose legal responsibility may arise under the doctrines of either contributory or vicarious liability  15   edit  Limits and defenses to claims of infringement Trademark is subject to various defenses  such as abandonment  limitations on geographic scope  and fair use  In the United States  the fair use defence protects many of the interests in free expression related to those protected by the First Amendment  16  Fair use may be asserted on two grounds  either that the alleged infringer is using the mark to describe accurately an aspect of its products  or that the alleged infringer is using the mark to identify the mark owner  One of the most visible proofs that trademarks provide a limited right in the U S  comes from the comparative advertising that is seen throughout U S  media  17  An example of the first type is that although Maytag owns the trademark  Whisper Quiet   makers of other products may describe their goods as being  whisper quiet  as long as they are not making items that are similar to Maytag  An example of the second type is that Audi can run advertisements saying that a trade publication has rated an Audi model higher than a BMW model  since they are only using  BMW  to identify the competitor  In a related sense  an auto mechanic can truthfully advertise that he services Cadillacs  and a former Playboy Playmate of the Year can identify herself as such on her website  18   edit  Wrongful or groundless threats of infringement Various jurisdictions have laws which are designed to prevent trademark owners from making wrongful threats of trademark infringement action against other parties  These laws are intended to prevent large or powerful companies from intimidating or harassing smaller companies  Where one party makes a threat to sue another for trademark infringement  but does not have a genuine basis or intention to carry out that threat  or does not carry out the threat at all within a certain period  the threat may itself become a basis for legal action  19  In this situation  the party receiving such a threat may seek from the Court a declaratory judgment  also known as a declaratory ruling   edit  Other aspects  edit  Public policy Trademark law is designed to fulfill the public policy objective of consumer protection  by preventing the public from being misled as to the origin or quality of a product or service  By identifying the commercial source of products and services  trademarks facilitate identification of products and services which meet the expectations of consumers as to quality and other characteristics  Trademarks may also serve as an incentive for manufacturers  providers or suppliers to consistently provide quality products or services to maintain their business reputation  Furthermore  if a trademark owner does not maintain quality control and adequate supervision in relation to the manufacture and provision of products or services supplied by a licensee  such  naked licensing  will eventually adversely affect the owner s rights in the trademark  This proposition has  however  been watered down by the judgment of the House of Lords in the case of Scandecor Development AB v  Scandecor Marketing AB et al   2001  UKHL 21  wherein it has been held that the mere fact that a bare license  equivalent of the United States concept of a naked license  has been granted did not automatically mean that a trademark was liable to mislead  By the same token  trademark holders must be cautious in the sale of their mark for similar reasons as apply to licensing  When assigning an interest in a trademark  if the associated product or service is not transferred with it  then this may be an  assignment in gross  and could lead to a loss of rights in the trademark  It is still possible to make significant changes to the underlying goods or services during a sale without jeopardizing the trademark  but companies will often contract with the sellers to help transition the mark and goods or services to the new owners to ensure continuity of the trademark   edit  Comparison with patents  designs and copyright See also  Functionality doctrine While trademark law seeks to protect indications of the commercial source of products or services  patent law generally seeks to protect new and useful inventions  and registered designs law generally seeks to protect the look or appearance of a manufactured article  Trademarks  patents and designs collectively form a subset of intellectual property known as industrial property because they are often created and used in an industrial or commercial context  By comparison  copyright law generally seeks to protect original literary  artistic and other creative works  Continued active use and re registration can make a trademark perpetual  whereas copyright usually lasts for the duration of the author s lifespan plus 70 years for works by individuals  and some limited time after creation for works by bodies corporate  20  This can lead to confusion in cases where a work passes into the public domain but the character in question remains a registered trademark  Although intellectual property laws such as these are theoretically distinct  more than one type may afford protection to the same article  For example  the particular design of a bottle may qualify for copyright protection as a non utilitarian  sculpture   or for trademark protection based on its shape  or the  trade dress  appearance of the bottle as a whole may be protectable  Titles and character names from books or movies may also be protectable as trademarks while the works from which they are drawn may qualify for copyright protection as a whole  Drawing these distinctions is necessary  but often challenging for the courts and lawyers  especially in jurisdictions where patents and copyrights pass into the public domain  depending on the jurisdiction  Unlike patents and copyrights  which in theory are granted for one off fixed terms  trademarks remain valid as long as the owner actively uses and defends them and maintains their registrations with the competent authorities  This often involves payment of a periodic renewal fee  As a trademark must be used to maintain rights in relation to that mark  a trademark can be  abandoned  or its registration can be cancelled or revoked if the mark is not continuously used  By comparison  patents and copyrights cannot be  abandoned  and a patent holder or copyright owner can generally enforce their rights without taking any particular action to maintain the patent or copyright  Additionally  patent holders and copyright owners may not necessarily need to actively police their rights  However  a failure to bring a timely infringement suit or action against a known infringer may give the defendant a defense of implied consent or estoppel when suit is finally brought   edit  Dilution Main article  Trademark dilution A trademark is diluted when the use of similar or identical trademarks in other non competing markets means that the trademark in and of itself will lose its capacity to signify a single source  In other words  unlike ordinary trademark law  dilution protection extends to trademark uses that do not confuse consumers regarding who has made a product  Instead  dilution protection law aims to protect sufficiently strong trademarks from losing their singular association in the public mind with a particular product  perhaps imagined if the trademark were to be encountered independently of any product  e g   just the word Pepsi spoken  or on a billboard   Under trademark law  dilution occurs either when unauthorized use of a mark  blurs  the  distinctive nature of the mark  or  tarnishes it   Likelihood of confusion is not required  15 U S C    1127  1125 c    edit  Sale  transfer and licensing In various jurisdictions a trademark may be sold with or without the underlying goodwill which subsists in the business associated with the mark  However  this is not the case in the United States  where the courts have held that this would  be a fraud upon the public   In the U S   trademark registration can therefore only be sold and assigned if accompanied by the sale of an underlying asset  Examples of assets whose sale would ordinarily support the assignment of a mark include the sale of the machinery used to produce the goods that bear the mark  or the sale of the corporation  or subsidiary  that produces the trademarked goods  Most jurisdictions provide for the use of trademarks to be licensed to third parties  The licensor  usually the trademark owner  must monitor the quality of the goods being produced by the licensee to avoid the risk of trademark being deemed abandoned by the courts  A trademark license should therefore include appropriate provisions dealing with quality control  whereby the licensee provides warranties as to quality and the licensor has rights to inspection and monitoring   edit  Domain names The advent of the domain name system has led to attempts by trademark holders to enforce their rights over domain names that are similar or identical to their existing trademarks  particularly by seeking control over the domain names at issue  As with dilution protection  enforcing trademark rights over domain name owners involves protecting a trademark outside the obvious context of its consumer market  because domain names are global and not limited by goods or service  This conflict was more easily resolved when the domain name user actually used his website to compete with the trademark owner  Cybersquatting  however  involves no such competition  but instead an unlicensed user registering the trademark as a domain name to pressure a payoff  or other benefit  from the lawful mark owner  Typosquatters those registering common misspellings of trademarks as domain names have also been targeted successfully in trademark infringement suits  Other types of domain name disputes include the so called  gripe site   which use a registered trademark in a domain such as   trademark sucks com   There are also disputes arising from the subdomain  when a third party uses a protected mark in a web address such as   trademark   legitimatedomain  com   21  This clash of the new technology with preexisting trademark rights resulted in several high profile decisions as the courts of many countries tried to coherently address the issue  and not always successfully  within the framework of existing trademark law  As the website itself was not the product being purchased  there was no actual consumer confusion  and so initial interest confusion was a concept applied instead  Initial interest confusion refers to customer confusion that creates an initial interest in a competitor s  product   in the online context  another party s website   Even though initial interest confusion is dispelled by the time any actual sales occur  it allows a trademark infringer to capitalize on the goodwill associated with the original mark  Several cases have wrestled with the concept of initial interest confusion  In Brookfield Commc ns v  West Coast Ent mt the court found initial interest confusion could occur when a competitor s trademarked terms were used in the HTML metatags of a website  resulting in that site appearing in the search results when a user searches on the trademarked term  In Playboy v  Netscape  the court found initial interest confusion when users typed in Playboy s trademarks into a search engine  resulting in the display of search results alongside unlabeled banner ads  triggered by keywords that included Playboy s marks  that would take users to Playboy s competitors  Though users might ultimately realize upon clicking on the banner ads that they were not Playboy affiliated  the court found that the competitor advertisers could have gained customers by appropriating Playboy s goodwill since users may be perfectly happy to browse the competitor s site instead of returning the search results to find the Playboy sites  In Lamparello v  Falwell  however  the court clarified that a finding of initial interest confusion is contingent on financial profit from said confusion  such that  if a domain name confusing similar to a registered trademark is used for a non trademark related website  the site owner will not be found to have infringed where he does not seek to capitalize on the mark s goodwill for his own commercial enterprises  In addition  courts have upheld the rights of trademark owners with regard to commercial use of domain names  even in cases where goods sold there legitimately bear the mark  In the landmark decision Creative Gifts  Inc  v  UFO  235 F 3d 540  10th Cir  2000  New Mexico   defendants had registered the domain name  Levitron com  to sell goods bearing the trademark  Levitron  under an at will license from the trademark owner  The 10th Circuit affirmed the rights of the trademark owner with regard to said domain name  despite arguments of promissory estoppel  Most courts particularly frowned on cybersquatting  and found that it was itself a sufficiently commercial use  i e    trafficking  in trademarks  to reach into the area of trademark infringement  Most jurisdictions have since amended their trademark laws to address domain names specifically  and to provide explicit remedies against cybersquatters  In the US  the legal situation was clarified by the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act  an amendment to the Lanham Act  which explicitly prohibited cybersquatting  It defines cybersquatting as   occurring  when a person other than the trademark holder registers the domain name of a well known trademark and then attempts to profit from this by either ransoming the domain name back to the trademark holder or using the domain name to divert business from the trademark holder to the domain name holder   22  The provision states that   a  person shall be liable in a civil action by the owner of the mark     if  without regard to the goods or services of the person  that person  i  had a bad faith intent to profit from the mark      and registers  traffics in  or uses domain name  that is confusingly similar to another s mark or dilutes another s mark    23  This international legal change has also led to the creation of ICANN Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy  UDRP  and other dispute policies for specific countries  such as Nominet UK s Dispute Resolution Service  which attempt to streamline the process of resolving who should own a domain name  without dealing with other infringement issues such as damages   This is particularly desirable to trademark owners when the domain name registrant may be in another country or even anonymous  Registrants of domain names also sometimes wish to register the domain names themselves  e g    XYZ COM   as trademarks for perceived advantages  such as an extra bulwark against their domain being hijacked  and to avail themselves of such remedies as confusion or passing off against other domain holders with confusingly similar or intentionally misspelled domain names  As with other trademarks  the domain name will not be subject to registration unless the proposed mark is actually used to identify the registrant s goods or services to the public  rather than simply being the location on the Internet where the applicant s web site appears  Amazon com is a prime example of a protected trademark for a domain name central to the public s identification of the company and its products  Terms which are not protectable by themselves  such as a generic term or a merely descriptive term that has not acquired secondary meaning  may become registrable when a Top Level Domain Name  e g  dot COM  is appended to it  An example of such a domain name ineligible for trademark or service mark protection as a generic term  but which currently has a registered U S  service mark  is  HEARSAY COM   24  Among trademark practitioners there remains a great deal of debate around trademark protection under ICANN s proposed generic top level domain name space expansion  World Trademark Review has been reporting on the at times fiery discussion between trademark owners and domainers  25   edit  International law It is important to note that although there are systems which facilitate the filing  registration or enforcement of trademark rights in more than one jurisdiction on a regional or global basis  e g  the Madrid and CTM systems  see further below   it is currently not possible to file and obtain a single trademark registration which will automatically apply around the world  Like any national law  trademark laws apply only in their applicable country or jurisdiction  a quality which is sometimes known as  territoriality    edit  Territorial application The inherent limitations of the territorial application of trademark laws have been mitigated by various intellectual property treaties  foremost amongst which is the WTO Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS establishes legal compatibility between member jurisdictions by requiring the harmonization of applicable laws  For example  Article 15 1  of TRIPS provides a definition for  sign  which is used as or forms part of the definition of  trademark  in the trademark legislation of many jurisdictions around the world   edit  Madrid system Main article  Madrid system The major international system for facilitating the registration of trademarks in multiple jurisdictions is commonly known as the  Madrid system   Madrid provides a centrally administered system for securing trademark registrations in member jurisdictions by extending the protection of an  international registration  obtained through the World Intellectual Property Organization  This international registration is in turn based upon an application or registration obtained by a trade mark applicant in its home jurisdiction  The primary advantage of the Madrid system is that it allows a trademark owner to obtain trademark protection in many jurisdictions by filing one application in one jurisdiction with one set of fees  and make any changes  e g  changes of name or address  and renew registration across all applicable jurisdictions through a single administrative process  Furthermore  the  coverage  of the international registration may be extended to additional member jurisdictions at any time   edit  Trademark Law Treaty The Trademark Law Treaty establishes a system pursuant to which member jurisdictions agree to standardize procedural aspects of the trademark registration process  It is not necessarily respective of rules within individual countries  26   edit  Community Trade Mark system Main article  Community Trade Mark The Community Trade Mark system is the trademark system which applies in the European Union  whereby registration of a trademark with the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market  Trade Marks and Designs   i e  OHIM  the trademarks office of the European Union   leads to a registration which is effective throughout the EU as a whole  The CTM system is therefore said to be unitary in character  in that a CTM registration applies indivisibly across all European Union member states  However  the CTM system did not replace the national trademark registration systems  the CTM system and the national systems continue to operate in parallel to each other  see also European Union trade mark law   If you reside outside the EU  you must have professional representative to the procedures before the OHIM  If you are a European resident  you don t have to have professional representation to file an opposition  however  it is strongly recommended by the OHIM  One of the tasks of a CTM owner is the monitoring of the later applications whether any of those is similar to his her earlier trademark  Monitoring is not easy and usually requires professional expertise  To conduct a monitoring there is the so called Trademark Watching service where it can be checked if someone tries to get registered marks that are similar to the existing marks  Oppositions should be filed on the standard opposition form in any official language of the European Union  however  the substantive part of the opposition  e g  the argumentations  can be submitted only in the language of
