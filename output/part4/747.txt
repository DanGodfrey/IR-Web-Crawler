wagon train in the Mojave Desert during construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1909 Caterpillar D2 on display in the Serpentine Vintage Tractor Museum  Serpentine  Western Australia  edit  Origins The steam tractors of the 1890s and early 1900s were extremely heavy  sometimes weighing 1 000 pounds  450 kg  per horsepower  and often sank into the rich  soft earth of the San Joaquin Valley Delta farmland surrounding Stockton  California  Benjamin Holt attempted to fix the problem by increasing the size and width of the wheels up to 7 5 feet  2 3 m  tall and 6 feet  1 8 m  wide  producing a tractor 46 feet  14 m  wide  But this also made the tractors increasingly complex  expensive and difficult to maintain  Another solution considered was to lay a temporary plank road ahead of the steam tractor  but this was time consuming  expensive  and interfered with earthmoving  Holt thought of wrapping the planks around the wheels  He replaced the wheels on a 40 horsepower  30 kW  Holt steamer  No  77  with a set of wooden tracks bolted to chains  On Thanksgiving Day  November 24  1904  he successfully tested the updated machine plowing the soggy delta land of Roberts Island  10  Company photographer Charles Clements was reported to have observed that the tractor crawled like a caterpillar  2  and Holt seized on the metaphor   Caterpillar it is  That s the name for it   10  Some sources  though  attribute this name to British soldiers in July 1907  11  Two years later Holt sold his first steam powered tractor crawlers for US 5 500  Each side featured a track frame measured 30 inches  760 mm  high by 42 inches  1 100 mm  wide and were 9 feet  2 7 m  long  The tracks were 3 inches  76 mm  by 4 inches  100 mm  redwood slats  10  Holt received the first patent for a practical continuous track for use with a tractor on December 7  1907 for his improved  Traction Engine    improvement in vehicles  and especially of the traction engine class  and included endless traveling platform supports upon which the engine is carried    12   edit  Move to Peoria In February 2  1910  13  Holt opened up a plant in East Peoria  Illinois  led by his nephew Pliny Holt  There Pliny met farm implement dealer Murray Baker who knew of an empty factory that had been recently built to manufacture farm implements and steam traction engines  Baker  who later became the first executive vice president of what became Caterpillar Tractor Company  wrote to Holt headquarters in Stockton and described the plant of the bankrupt Colean Manufacturing Co  of East Peoria  Illinois  On October 25  1909  Pliny Holt purchased the factory  14  and immediately began operations with 12 employees  15  Holt incorporated it as the Holt Caterpillar Company  although he did not trademark the name Caterpillar until August 2  1910  13  The addition of a plant in the Midwest  despite the hefty capital needed to retool the plant  proved so profitable that only two years later the company employed 625 people and was exporting tractors to Argentina  Canada  and Mexico  16  Tractors were built in both Stockton and East Peoria  17  18   edit  Use in World War I Holt s track type tractors play a support role in World War I  Even before the U S  formally entered WWI  Holt had shipped 1 200 tractors to England  France and Russia for agricultural purposes  These governments  however  sent the tractors directly to the battlefront where the military put them to work hauling artillery and supplies  19  When World War I broke out  the British War Office ordered a Holt tractor and put it through trials at Aldershot  The War Office was suitably impressed and chose it as a gun tractor  20  Over the next four years  the Holt tractor became a major artillery tractor  mainly used to haul medium guns like the 6 inch howitzer  the 60 pounder  and later the 9 2 inch howitzer  21  Holt tractors were also the inspiration for the development of the British tank  which profoundly altered ground warfare tactics  10  22  Major Ernest Swinton  sent to France as an army war correspondent  very soon saw the potential of a track laying tractor  23  116 Although the British later chose an English firm to build its first tanks  the Holt tractor became  one of the most important military vehicles of all time   21   edit  Post war challenges Holt tractors had become well known during World War I  Military contracts formed the major part of the company s production  When the war ended  Holt s planned expansion to meet the military s needs was abruptly terminated  The heavy duty tractors needed by the military were unsuitable for farmers  The company s situation worsened when artillery tractors were returned from Europe  depressing prices for new equipment and Holt s unsold inventory of military tractors  The company struggled with the transition from wartime boom to peacetime bust  To keep the company afloat  they borrowed heavily  C  L  Best Gas Tractor Company  formed by Clarence Leo Best in 1910 and Holt s primary competitor  had during the war received government support enabling it to supply farmers with the smaller agricultural tractors they needed  24  25  As a result  Best had gained a considerable market advantage over Holt by war s end  Best also assumed considerable debt to allow it to continue expansion  especially production of its new Best Model 60  Tracklayer   Both companies were adversely impacted by the transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy  which contributed to a nationwide depression  further inhibiting sales  On December 5  1920  71 year old Benjamin Holt died after a month long illness  25  26   edit  Caterpillar company formed The banks who held the company s large debt forced the Holt board of directors to accept their candidate  Thomas A  Baxter  to succeed Benjamin Holt  Baxter initially cut the large tractors from the company s product line and introduced smaller models focused on the agricultural market  When the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 funded a US 1 billion federal highway building program  Baxter began re focusing the company towards building road construction equipment  14  66 Both companies also faced fierce competition from the Fordson company  Between 1907 and 1918  Best and Holt had spent about US 1 5 million in legal fees fighting each other in a number of contractual  trademark and patent infringement lawsuits  27  Harry H  Fair of the bond brokerage house of Pierce  Fair  amp  Company of San Francisco had helped to finance C  L  Best s debt and Holt shareholders approached him about their company s financial difficulty  Fair recommended that the two companies should merge  In April and May 1925  the financially stronger C  L  Best merged with the market leader Holt Caterpillar to form the Caterpillar Tractor Co  28  The new company was headquartered in San Leandro until 1930  when under the terms of the merger it was moved to Peoria  15  Baxter had been removed as CEO earlier in 1925  and Clarence Leo Best assumed the title of CEO  and remained in that role until October 1951  24  The Caterpillar company consolidated its product lines  offering only five track type tractors  the 2 Ton  5 Ton  and 10 Ton from the Holt Manufacturing Company s old product line and the Caterpillar 30 and Caterpillar 60 from the C  L  Best Tractor Co  s former product line  The 10 Ton and 5 Ton models were discontinued in 1926  In 1928  the 2 Ton was discontinued  Sales the first year were US 13 million  By 1929  sales climbed to US 52 8 million  and CAT continued to grow throughout the Great Depression of the 1930s  Caterpillar adopted the diesel engine to replace gasoline engines  During World War II  Caterpillar products found fame with the Seabees  Construction Battalions of the United States Navy  who built airfields and other facilities in the Pacific Theater of Operations  During the post war construction boom  the company grew at a rapid pace and launched its first venture outside the U S  in 1950  marking the beginning of Caterpillar s development into a multinational corporation   edit  Expansion in developing markets Caterpillar built its first Russian facility in the town of Tosno  located near St  Petersburg  Russia  It was completed in 16 months and occupied in November 1999  It had the first electrical substation built in the Leningrad Oblast since the Communist government was dissolved on December 26  1991  The facility was built under harsh winter conditions  where the temperature was below  25 C  The facility construction was managed by the Lemmink inen Group located in Helsinki  Finland  citation needed  The  125M Caterpillar Suzhou  People s Republic of China facility  manufactures medium wheel loaders and motorgraders  primarily for the Asian market  The first machine is scheduled for production in March 2009  URS Ausino  in San Francisco  California  manages facility construction  citation needed  Caterpillar has manufactured in Brazil since 1960  29  In 2010 the company announced plans to further expand production of backhoe and small wheel loaders with a new factory  30   edit  Acquisitions

agricultural tractors as the result of several development programs over a long period of time  The program started in the 1970s and involved both D6 based units and Grader power units  A parallel program was also developing wheeled high hp tractors based on using the articulated loading shovel chassis was latter merged with the crawler team  The result was the Challenger Tractor and the  Mobi Trac  system  The Challenger has been marketed in Europe as Claas machines since 1997  with Caterpillar marketing the Claas built Lexion combine range in the USA  Claas and Caterpillar formed a joint venture  Claas Omaha  to build combine harvesters in Omaha  Nebraska  USA under the CAT brand  In 2002  Cat sold its stake to Claas  and licensed the use of CAT and the CAT yellow livery to Claas  They are marketed as Lexion combines now  Also in 2002  Caterpillar sold the Challenger tracked tractor business to AGCO and licensed the use of the Challenger and CAT names and livery to them  This

whom 50 562 are located outside the United States  Current employment figures represent a decline of 17 900 employees compared the third quarter of 2008  3  Due to the restructuring of business operations which began in the 1990s  there are 20 000 fewer union jobs in the Peoria  Illinois area while employment outside the U S  has increased  citation needed   edit  Labor practices Caterpillar came close to bankruptcy in the early 1980s  at one point losing almost US 1 million per day due to a sharp downturn in product demand as competition with Japanese rival Komatsu increased   At the time  Komatsu used the internal slogan  encircle Caterpillar    81  Caterpillar suffered further when the United States declared an embargo against the Soviet Union after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan  causing the company to be unable to sell US 400 million worth of pipelaying machinery that had already been built  82  Due to the drastic drop in demand  Caterpillar initiated employee layoffs  which led to strikes  primarily by the members of the United Auto Workers  against Caterpillar facilities in Illinois and Pennsylvania  Several news reports at the time indicated that products were piling up so high in facilities that replacement workers could barely make their way to their work stations  In 1992  the United Auto Workers conducted a five month strike against Caterpillar  In response  Caterpillar threatened to replace Caterpillar s entire unionized work force  Over ten thousand UAW members striked again in 1994 1995 for 17 months  a record at that time  The strike ended with the UAW deciding to return to work without a contract despite record revenues and profits by Caterpillar  83  In 1994 Caterpillar offered a contract to the UAW members that would have raised the salary of top workers from  35 000 to  39 000 per year  However  the UAW was seeking the same top wage of  40 000 that was paid to workers at Deere  amp  Company in 1994  84  During the strikes  Caterpillar used management employees in an attempt to maintain production  Caterpillar suspended research and development work  sending thousands of engineers and other non bargained for employees into Caterpillar s manufacturing and assembly facilities to replace striking or locked out union members  Rather than continuing to fight the United Auto Workers  Caterpillar chose to make itself less vulnerable to the traditional bargaining tactics of organized labor  One way Caterpillar achieved its goal was by outsourcing much of Caterpillar s parts production and warehouse work to outside firms  In another move  according to United Auto Workers union officials and industry analysts  Caterpillar began to execute a  southern strategy   85  The  southern strategy  involved opening new  small plants  termed  focus facilities   in right to work states  Caterpillar opened these new  smaller facilities in Clayton and Sanford North Carolina  Greenville South Carolina  Corinth Mississippi  Dyersburg Tennessee  Griffin Georgia  LaGrange and Seguin Texas and North Little Rock Arkansas  In 2012  the company locked out workers at a locomotive plant in London  Ontario  Canada and demanded some accept up to a 50 per cent cut in pay  86  The move created controversy in Canada with some complaining the plant was acquired under false pretenses  87  Retail store Mark s Work Wearhouse  began pulling Caterpillar boots from its shelves as a result  88   edit  Environmental record In addition to devoting engineering resources to ensure that Caterpillar machinery meets or exceeds environmental laws and regulations in markets worldwide  Caterpillar also actively participates in programs that promote environmental sustainability  Despite Caterpillar s efforts to further pro environmental sustainability goals  Caterpillar has also been found to be in violation of environmental protection laws   edit  Environmental stewardship Caterpillar divisions have won Illinois Governor s Pollution Prevention Awards every year since 1997  89  Caterpillar was awarded the 2007 Illinois Governor s Pollution Prevention Award for three projects  The Hydraulics and Hydraulic Systems business unit in Joliet implemented a flame sprayed coating for its truck suspension system  replacing a chroming process  reducing hazardous waste by 700 000 pounds annually and saving 14 million US gallons  53 000 m3  of water  Caterpillar s Cast Metals Organization in Mapleton worked with the American Foundry Society to help produce a rule to reduce hazardous waste in scrap metal that meet strict quality requirements  and also allow foundries to continue recycling certain types of scrap and maintain a competitive cost structure  Caterpillar s Mossville Engine Center formed a team to look at used oil re use and recycle processes that forced MEC to send large amounts of used oil off site for recycling  and developed an updated system for reclaiming it for re use on site  The resulting benefits included a usage reduction of about 208 000 US gallons  790 m3  of oil per year  90  Caterpillar actively participates in initiatives such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency s National Clean Diesel Campaign program  which encourages retrofitting fleets of older buses and trucks with newer diesel engines that meet higher emissions standards  91  92  In 2005  Caterpillar donated  12 million dollars to The Nature Conservancy in a joint effort to protect and preserve river systems in Brazil  U S A   and China  93  Caterpillar has  for many years  been a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development based in Geneva  Switzerland  94  Caterpillar has been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index each year since 2001  95   edit  Violations of environmental law In July 1999  Caterpillar and five other diesel engine manufacturers signed a consent decree with the Justice Department and the State of California  after governmental investigations revealed violations of the Clean Air Act  The violation involve over a million diesel engines sold with  defeat devices   devices that regulated emissions during pre sale tests  but that could be disabled in favor of better performance during subsequent highway driving  Consequently  these engines     emit up to triple the permissible level of smog forming nitrogen oxides  NOx   In 1998 alone  these violating vehicles emitted 1 3 million tons of additional NOx   an amount equal to the emissions of 65 million cars   For this reason  Caterpillar was named the  Clean Air Villain of the Month  for August 2000 by the Clean Air Trust  96  The consent decree provided that  83 million be paid in civil penalties and determined new deadlines for meeting emissions standards  Caterpillar  however  was successful in lobbying for an extension of deadlines they considered too severe  Even so  in October  2002  Caterpillar   the only diesel engine company  of those that signed decrees  to fail to meet the new emissions standards deadline   was forced to pay  128 million in per engine non conformance penalties  97   edit  Advocacy  philanthropy and awards Caterpillar is a leading member of the U S  Global Leadership Coalition  a Washington D C  based coalition of over 400 major companies and NGOs that advocates for increased funding of American diplomatic and development efforts abroad through the International Affairs Budget  98  Economic development projects in developing countries  particularly in rural  agricultural regions  serve as new markets for Caterpillar products by improving political and economic stability and raising average incomes   edit  See also Companies portal G numbers for U S  Army Caterpillar tractors   edit
