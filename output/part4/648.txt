 R publique du Cameroun   is a country in west Central Africa  It is bordered by Nigeria to the west  Chad to the northeast  the Central African Republic to the east  and Equatorial Guinea  Gabon  and the Republic of the Congo to the south  Cameroon s coastline lies on the Bight of Bonny  part of the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean  The country is called  Africa in miniature  for its geological and cultural diversity  Natural features include beaches  deserts  mountains  rainforests  and savannas  The highest point is Mount Cameroon in the southwest  and the largest cities are Douala  Yaound   and Garoua  Cameroon is home to over 200 different linguistic groups  The country is well known for its native styles of music  particularly makossa and bikutsi  and for its successful national football team  French and English are the official languages  Early inhabitants of the territory included the Sao civilisation around Lake Chad and the Baka hunter gatherers in the southeastern rainforest  Portuguese explorers reached the coast in the 15th century and named the area Rio dos Camar es   River of Prawns    the name from which Cameroon derives  Fulani 5  soldiers founded the Adamawa Emirate in the north in the 19th century  and various ethnic groups of the west and northwest established powerful chiefdoms and fondoms  Cameroon became a German colony in 1884  After World War I  the territory was divided between France and Britain as League of Nations mandates  The Union des Populations du Cameroun political party advocated independence but was outlawed by France in the 1950s  It waged war on French and UPC militant forces until 1971  In 1960  the French administered part of Cameroon became independent as the Republic of Cameroun under President Ahmadou Ahidjo  The southern part of British Cameroons merged with it in 1961 to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon  The country was renamed the United Republic of Cameroon in 1972 and the Republic of Cameroon in 1984  Compared to other African countries  Cameroon enjoys relatively high political and social stability  This has permitted the development of agriculture  roads  railways  and large petroleum and timber industries  Nevertheless  large numbers of Cameroonians live in poverty as subsistence farmers  Power lies firmly in the hands of the authoritarian president since 1982  Paul Biya  and his Cameroon People s Democratic Movement party  The English speaking territories of Cameroon have grown increasingly alienated from the government  and politicians from those regions have called for greater decentralization and even secession  for example  the Southern Cameroons National Council  of the former British governed territories  Contents 1 History 2 Politics and government 3

of Cameroon Joseph Merrick  shown here attending an Isubu funeral in 1845  was a Jamaican Baptist missionary who established a church among the Isubu of the coast  The manuscript above is written in a Bamum script used in Cameroon today  The territory of present day Cameroon was first settled during the Neolithic  The longest continuous inhabitants are groups such as the Baka  Pygmies   6  From here  Bantu migrations into eastern  southern  and central Africa are believed to have originated about 2 000 years ago  7  The Sao culture arose around Lake Chad c  AD 500 and gave way to the Kanem and its successor state  the Bornu empire  Kingdoms  fondoms  and chiefdoms arose in the west  Portuguese sailors reached the coast in 1472  They noted an abundance of the mud lobster Lepidophthalmus turneranus in the Wouri River and named it Rio dos Camar es  Portuguese for  River of Shrimp   and the phrase from which Cameroon is derived  Over the following few centuries  European interests regularised trade with the coastal peoples  and Christian missionaries pushed inland  In the early 19th century  Modibo Adama led Fulani soldiers on a jihad in the north against non Muslim and partially Muslim peoples and established the Adamawa Emirate  Settled peoples who fled the Fulani caused a major redistribution of population  8  The northern part of Cameroon was an important part of the Muslim slave trade network  7  The Bamum people have an indigenous writing system  known as Bamum script or Shu Mom  The script was developed by Sultan Ibrahim Njoya in 1896  9  10  and is taught in Cameroon by the Bamum Scripts and Archives Project  10  The German Empire claimed the territory as the colony of Kamerun in 1884 and began a steady push inland  They initiated projects to improve the colony s infrastructure  relying on a harsh system of forced labour  11  With the defeat of Germany in World War I  Kamerun became a League of Nations mandate territory and was split into French Cameroun and British Cameroons in 1919  France integrated the economy of Cameroun with that of France 12  and improved the infrastructure with capital investments  skilled workers  and continued forced labour  11  The British administered their territory from neighbouring Nigeria  Natives complained that this made them a neglected  colony of a colony   Nigerian migrant workers flocked to Southern Cameroons  ending forced labour but angering indigenous peoples  13  The League of Nations mandates were converted into United Nations Trusteeships in 1946  and the question of independence became a pressing issue in French Cameroun  12  France outlawed the most radical political party  the Union des Populations du Cameroun  UPC   on 13 July 1955  This prompted a long guerrilla war and the assassination of the party s leader  Ruben Um Nyob   near Boumnyebel  the village where he was born  In British Cameroons  the question was whether to reunify with French Cameroun or join Nigeria  Ahmadou Ahidjo arrives at Washington  D C   in July 1982  On 1 January 1960 at 2 30 am  French Cameroun gained independence from France under President Ahmadou Ahidjo  On 1 October 1961  the formerly British Southern Cameroons united with French Cameroun to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon  Ahidjo used the ongoing war with the UPC to concentrate power in the presidency  continuing with this even after the suppression of the UPC in 1971  14  His political party  the Cameroon National Union  CNU   became the sole legal political party on 1 September 1966 and in 1972  the federal system of government was abolished in favour of a United Republic of Cameroon  headed from Yaound   15  Ahidjo pursued an economic policy of planned liberalism  prioritising cash crops and petroleum exploitation  The government used oil money to create a national cash reserve  pay farmers  and finance major development projects  however  many initiatives failed when Ahidjo appointed unqualified allies to direct them  16  Ahidjo stepped down on 4 November 1982 and left power to his constitutional successor  Paul Biya  However  Ahidjo remained in control of the CNU and tried to run the country from behind the scenes until Biya and his allies pressured him into resigning  Biya began his administration by moving toward a more democratic government  but a failed coup d  tat nudged him toward the leadership style of his predecessor  17  An economic crisis took effect in the mid 1980s to late 1990s as a result of international economic conditions  drought  falling petroleum prices  and years of corruption  mismanagement  and cronyism  Cameroon turned to foreign aid  cut government spending  and privatised industries  With the reintroduction of multi party politics in December 1990  the former British Cameroons pressure groups called for greater autonomy  with some  SCNC  advocating complete secession as the Republic of Ambazonia  18  In February 2008  Cameroon experienced its worst violence in 15 years when a transport union strike in Douala escalated into violent protests in 31 municipal areas  19  20   edit  Politics and government Main article  Politics of Cameroon President Paul Biya of Cameroon and Ambassador R  Niels Marquardt of the United States  16 February 2006  The President of Cameroon has broad  unilateral powers to create policy  administer government agencies  command the armed forces  negotiate and ratify treaties  and declare a state of emergency  21  The president appoints government officials at all levels  from the prime minister  considered the official head of government   to the provincial governors  divisional officers  and urban council members in large cities  The president is selected by popular vote every seven years  In smaller municipalities  the public elects mayors and councilors  Corruption is rife at all levels of government  In 1997  Cameroon established anti corruption bureaus in 29 ministries  but only 25  became operational  22  and in 2007  Transparency International placed Cameroon at number 138 on a list of 163 countries ranked from least to most corrupt  23  On 18 January 2006  Biya initiated an anti corruption drive under the direction of the National Anti Corruption Observatory  22  Cameroon s legal system is largely based on French civil law with common law influences  24  Although nominally independent  the judiciary falls under the authority of the executive s Ministry of Justice  25  The president appoints judges at all levels  The judiciary is officially divided into tribunals  the court of appeal  and the supreme court  The National Assembly elects the members of a nine member High Court of Justice that judges high ranking members of government in the event they are charged with high treason or harming national security  A statue of a chief in Bana  West Region  shows the prestige afforded such rulers  The Cameroonian government recognizes the power of traditional authorities provided their rulings do not contradict national law  Human rights organisations accuse police and military forces of mistreating and even torturing criminal suspects  ethnic minorities  homosexuals  and political activists  26  Prisons are overcrowded with little access to adequate food and medical facilities  27  28  and prisons run by traditional rulers in the north are charged with holding political opponents at the behest of the government  29  However  since the first decade of the 21st century  an increasing number of police and gendarmes have been prosecuted for improper conduct  28  The National Assembly makes legislation  The body consists of 180 members who are elected for five year terms and meet three times per year  Laws are passed on a majority vote  Rarely has the assembly changed or blocked legislation proposed by the president  The 1996 constitution establishes a second house of parliament  the 100 seat Senate  but this body has never been put into practice  24  The government recognises the authority of traditional chiefs  fons  and lamibe to govern at the local level and to resolve disputes as long as such rulings do not conflict with national law  30  President Paul Biya s Cameroon People s Democratic Movement  CPDM  was the only legal political party until December 1990  Numerous regional political groups have since formed  The primary opposition is the Social Democratic Front  SDF   based largely in the Anglophone region of the country and headed by John Fru Ndi  31  Biya and his party have maintained control of the presidency and the National Assembly in national elections  but rivals contend that these have been unfair  18  Human rights organisations allege that the government suppresses the freedoms of opposition groups by preventing demonstrations  disrupting meetings  and arresting opposition leaders and journalists  29  32 Freedom House ranks Cameroon as  not free  in terms of political rights and civil liberties  33  The last parliamentary elections were held on 22 July 2007  34  Cameroon is a member of both the Commonwealth of Nations and La Francophonie  Its foreign policy closely follows that of its main ally  France  the former colonial ruler   35  The country relies heavily on France for its defence  25  although military spending is high in comparison to other sectors of government  36  Biya has clashed with the government of Nigeria over possession of the Bakassi peninsula and with Gabon s president  El Hadj Omar Bongo  over personal rivalries  31   edit  Education

trained doctors  In 2001  the literacy rate of Cameroon was estimated to be 67 9   77  for males and 59 8  for females   37  Most children have access to free  state run schools or subsidised  private and religious facilities  38  The educational system is a mixture of British and French precedents 39  with most instruction in English or French  40  Cameroon has one of the highest school attendance rates in Africa  38  Girls attend school less regularly than boys do because of cultural attitudes  domestic duties  early marriage and pregnancy  and sexual harassment  Although attendance rates are higher in the south  38  a disproportionate number of teachers are stationed there  leaving northern schools chronically understaffed  28  The quality of health care is generally low  41  Outside the major cities  facilities are often dirty and poorly equipped  42  Endemic diseases include dengue fever  filariasis  leishmaniasis  malaria  meningitis  schistosomiasis  and sleeping sickness  43  The HIV AIDS seroprevalence rate is estimated at 5 4  for those aged 15 49  44  although a strong stigma against the illness keeps the number of reported cases artificially low  41 Traditional healers remain a popular alternative to Western medicine  45   edit  Regions Main articles  Regions of Cameroon and Divisions of Cameroon Cameroon is divided into 10 regions  The constitution divides Cameroon into 10 semi autonomous regions  each under the administration of an elected Regional Council  A presidential decree of 12 November 2008 officially instigated the change from provinces to regions  46  Each region is headed by a presidentially appointed governor  These leaders are charged with implementing the will of the president  reporting on the general mood and conditions of the regions  administering the civil service  keeping the peace  and overseeing the heads of the smaller administrative units  Governors have broad powers  they may order propaganda in their area and call in the army  gendarmes  and police  47  All local government officials are employees of the central government s Ministry of Territorial Administration  from which local governments also get most of their budgets  7  The regions are subdivided into 58 divisions  French d partements   These are headed by presidentially appointed divisional officers  pr fets   who perform the governors  duties on a smaller scale  The divisions are further sub divided into sub divisions  arrondissements   headed by assistant divisional officers  sous prefets   The districts  administered by district heads  chefs de district   are the smallest administrative units  These are found in large sub divisions and in regions that are difficult to reach  The three northernmost regions are the Far North  Extr me Nord   North  Nord   and Adamawa  Adamaoua   Directly south of them are the Centre  Centre  and East  Est   The South Province  Sud  lies on the Gulf of Guinea and the southern border  Cameroon s western region is split into four smaller regions  The Littoral  Littoral  and Southwest  Sud Ouest  regions are on the coast  and the Northwest  Nord Ouest  and West  Ouest  regions are in the western grassfields  The Northwest and Southwest were once part of British Cameroons  the other regions were in French Cameroon   edit  Geography Main article  Geography of Cameroon Volcanic plugs dot the

Republic of the Congo to the south  Cameroon is divided into five major geographic zones distinguished by dominant physical  climatic  and vegetative features  The coastal plain extends 15 to 150 kilometres  9 to 93 mi  inland from the Gulf of Guinea 51  and has an average elevation of 90 metres  295 ft   52  Exceedingly hot and humid with a short dry season  this belt is densely forested and includes some of the wettest places on earth  part of the Cross Sanaga Bioko coastal forests  53  54  The South Cameroon Plateau rises from the coastal plain to an average elevation of 650 metres  2 133 ft   55  Equatorial rainforest dominates this region  although its alternation between wet and dry seasons makes it is less humid than the coast  This area is part of the Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests ecoregion  Countryside near Ngaoundal in Cameroon s Adamawa Region  An irregular chain of mountains  hills  and plateaus known as the Cameroon range extends from Mount Cameroon on the coast Cameroon s highest point at 4 095 metres  13 435 ft  56  almost to Lake Chad at Cameroon s northern border at 13 05 N  This region has a mild climate  particularly on the Western High Plateau  although rainfall is high  Its soils are among Cameroon s most fertile  especially around volcanic Mount Cameroon  56  Volcanism here has created crater lakes  On 21 August 1986  one of these  Lake Nyos  belched carbon dioxide and killed between 1 700 and 2 000 people  57  This area has been delineated by the World Wildlife Fund as the Cameroonian Highlands forests ecoregion  The southern plateau rises northward to the grassy  rugged Adamawa Plateau  This feature stretches from the western mountain area and forms a barrier between the country s north and south  Its average elevation is 1 100 metres  3 609 ft   55  and its average temperature ranges from 22  C  71 6  F  to 25  C  77  F  with high rainfall between April and October peaking in July and August  58  The northern lowland region extends from the edge of the Adamawa to Lake Chad with an average elevation of 300 to 350 metres  984 to 1 148 ft   56  Its characteristic vegetation is savanna scrub and grass  This is an arid region with sparse rainfall and high median temperatures  Cameroon has four patterns of drainage  In the south  the principal rivers are the Ntem  Nyong  Sanaga  and Wouri  These flow southwestward or westward directly into the Gulf of Guinea  The Dja and Kad   drain southeastward into the Congo River  In northern Cameroon  the B nou  River runs north and west and empties into the Niger  The Logone flows northward into Lake Chad  which Cameroon shares with three neighbouring countries   edit  Economy and infrastructure Street vendor in Douala  Cameroon Fishing is a major industry in Cameroon  Fifteenth century Portuguese explorers found prawns in such abundance that they named the area Rio dos Camar es   River of Prawns    the name from which Cameroon derives  This prawn was caught at Limbe in 2007  Main article  Economy of Cameroon Cameroon s per capita GDP  Purchasing power parity  was estimated as US 2 300 in 2008  59  one of the ten highest in sub Saharan Africa  60  Major export markets include France  Italy  South Korea  Spain  and the United Kingdom  24  Cameroon has enjoyed a decade of strong economic performance  with GDP growing at an average of 4 percent per year  During the 2004 2008 period  public debt was reduced from over 60 percent of GDP to 10 percent and official reserves quadrupled to over USD 3 billion  61  Cameroon is part of the Bank of Central African States  of which it is the dominant economy   60  the Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa  UDEAC  and the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa  OHADA   62  Its currency is the CFA franc  Red tape  high taxes  and endemic corruption have impeded growth of the private sector  Unemployment was estimated at 30  in 2001  and about a third of the population was living below the international poverty threshold of US 1 25 a day in 2009  63  Since the late 1980s  Cameroon has been following programmes advocated by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund  IMF  to reduce poverty  privatise industries  and increase economic growth  25 Tourism is a growing sector  particularly in the coastal area  around Mount Cameroon  and in the north  Cameroon s natural resources are very well suited to agriculture and arboriculture  An estimated 70  of the population farms  and agriculture comprised an estimated 19 8  of GDP in 2009  24  Most agriculture is done at the subsistence scale by local farmers using simple tools  They sell their surplus produce  and some maintain separate fields for commercial use  Urban centres are particularly reliant on peasant agriculture for their foodstuffs  Soils and climate on the coast encourage extensive commercial cultivation of bananas  cocoa  oil palms  rubber  and tea  Inland on the South Cameroon Plateau  cash crops include coffee  sugar  and tobacco  Coffee is a major cash crop in the western highlands  and in the north  natural conditions favour crops such as cotton  groundnuts  and rice  Reliance on agricultural exports makes Cameroon vulnerable to shifts in their prices  24  A Fulani herder drives his cattle in northern Cameroon Livestock are raised throughout the country  Fishing employs some 5 000 people and provides 20 000 tons of seafood each year  Bushmeat  long a staple food for rural Cameroonians  is today a delicacy in the country s urban centres  The commercial bushmeat trade has now surpassed deforestation as the main threat to wildlife in Cameroon  The southern rainforest has vast timber reserves  estimated to cover 37  of Cameroon s total land area  However  large areas of the forest are difficult to reach  Logging  largely handled by foreign owned firms  provides the government US 60 million a year  and laws mandate the safe and sustainable exploitation of timber  Nevertheless  in practice  the industry is one of the least regulated in Cameroon  A bush taxi attempts to pass a stalled logging vehicle on the road between Abong Mbang and Lomi   East Region  Factory based industry accounted for an estimated 29 7  of GDP in 2009  24  More than 75  of Cameroon s industrial strength is located in Douala and Bonab ri  Cameroon possesses substantial mineral resources  but these are not extensively mined  25  Petroleum exploitation has fallen since 1985  but this is still a substantial sector such that dips in prices have a strong effect on the economy  Rapids and waterfalls obstruct the southern rivers  but these sites offer opportunities for hydroelectric development and supply most of Cameroon s energy  The Sanaga River powers the largest hydroelectric station  located at Ed a  The rest of Cameroon s energy comes from oil powered thermal engines  Much of the country remains without reliable power supplies  Transport in Cameroon is often difficult  Except for the several relatively good toll roads which connect major cities  all of them one lane  roads are poorly maintained and subject to inclement weather  since only 10  of the roadways are tarred  24  Roadblocks often serve little other purpose than to allow police and gendarmes to collect bribes from travellers  64  Road banditry has long hampered transport along the eastern and western borders  and since 2005  the problem has intensified in the east as the Central African Republic has further destabilised  65  Intercity bus services run by multiple private companies connect all major cities  Although intercity buses rarely depart on schedule but rather wait until all the tickets are sold  They are the most popular mean of transportation followed by the rail service Camrail  Rail service runs from Kumba in the west to B labo in the east and north to Ngaound r   International airports are located in Douala and Yaound   The airport at Bamenda is now closed  The Wouri estuary provides a harbour for Douala  the country s principal seaport  In the north  the B nou  River is seasonally navigable from Garoua across into Nigeria  Although press freedoms have improved since the first decade of the 21st century  the press is corrupt and beholden to special interests and political groups  66  Newspapers routinely self censor to avoid government reprisals  28  The major radio and television stations are state run and other communications  such as land based telephones and telegraphs  are largely under government control  67  However  cell phone networks and Internet providers have increased dramatically since the first decade of the 21st century 68  and are largely unregulated  29   edit  Demographics Main articles  Demographics of

centres  the western highlands  and the northeastern plain  71 Douala  Yaound   and Garoua are the largest cities  In contrast  the Adamawa Plateau  southeastern B nou  depression  and most of the South Cameroon Plateau are sparsely populated  72  People from the overpopulated western highlands and the underdeveloped north are moving to the coastal plantation zone and urban centres for employment  73  Smaller movements are occurring as workers seek employment in lumber mills and plantations in the south and east  74  Although the national sex ratio is relatively even  these out migrants are primarily males  which leads to unbalanced ratios in some regions  75  The homes of the Musgum  in the Far North Region  are made of earth and grass  Both monogamous and polygamous marriage are practiced  and the average Cameroonian family is large and extended  76  In the north  women tend to the home  and men herd cattle or work as farmers  In the south  women grow the family

282 different folks and linguistic groups in Cameroon  78  79  The Adamawa Plateau broadly bisects these into northern and southern divisions  The northern peoples are Sudanese groups  who live in the central highlands and the northern lowlands  and the Fulani  who are spread throughout northern Cameroon  A small number of Shuwa Arabs live near Lake Chad  Southern Cameroon is inhabited by speakers of Bantu and Semi Bantu languages  Bantu speaking groups inhabit the coastal and equatorial zones  while speakers of Semi Bantu languages live in the Western grassfields  Some 5 000 Pygmies roam the southeastern and coastal rainforests or live in small  roadside settlements  80  Nigerians  make up the largest group of foreign nationals  81  A Tikar family in the Northwest Province In 2007  Cameroon hosted a total population of refugees and asylum seekers of approximately 97 400  Of these  49 300 were from the Central African Republic  many driven west by war   82  41 600 from Chad  and 2 900 from Nigeria  83  Kidnappings of Cameroonian citizens by Central African bandits have increased since 2005  65  The European languages introduced during colonialism have created a linguistic divide between the population who live in the Northwest and Southwest regions and the French speaking remainder of the country  84  Both English and French are official languages  although French is by far the most understood language  80      85 German  the language of the original colonisers  has long since been displaced by French and English  Cameroonian Pidgin English is the lingua franca in

western regions  but practitioners of both faiths can be found throughout the country  88  Large cities have significant populations of both groups  88  There is significant internal migration  There are currently no active religious political parties  People from the North West and South West provinces are largely Protestant  and the French speaking regions of the southern and western regions are largely Catholic  88  Southern ethnic groups predominantly follow Christian or traditional African animist beliefs  or a syncretic combination of the two  People widely believe in witchcraft  and the government outlaws such practices  89  Suspected witches are often subject to mob violence  28  In the northern regions  the locally dominant Fulani ethnic group is mostly Muslim  but the overall population is fairly evenly divided among Muslims  Christians  and followers of indigenous religious beliefs  called Kirdi   pagan   by the Fulani   88  The Bamum ethnic group of the West Region is largely Muslim  88  Native traditional religions are practiced in rural areas throughout the country but rarely are practiced publicly in cities  in part because many indigenous religious groups are
