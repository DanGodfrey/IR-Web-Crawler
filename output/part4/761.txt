article  History of Walmart Sam Walton  a businessman from Arkansas  began his retail career when he started work on June 3  1940  at a J  C  Penney store in Des Moines  Iowa where he remained for 18 months  In 1945  he met Butler Brothers  a regional retailer that owned a chain of variety stores called Ben Franklin and that offered him one in Newport  Arkansas  6  Walton was extremely successful in running the store in Newport  far exceeding expectations  7  However  when the lease came up for renewal  Walton could neither come to agreement on the existing store s lease renewal nor find a new location in Newport  Instead  he opened a new Ben Franklin franchise in Bentonville  Arkansas  but called it  Walton s Five and Dime   There  he achieved higher sales volume by marking up slightly less than most competitors  8  On July 2  1962  Walton opened the first Wal Mart Discount City store located at 719 Walnut Ave  in Rogers  Arkansas  The building is now occupied by a hardware store and an antique mall  Within five years  the company expanded to 24 stores across Arkansas and reached  12 6 million in sales  9  In 1968  it opened its first stores outside Arkansas  in Sikeston  Missouri and Claremore  Oklahoma  10  Incorporation and growth Walmart s first logo used from 1962 1968  No stores have the logo nowadays  Walmart logo used from 1968 1981  There is only one store in existence still with this logo  Walmart logo used from 1981 1992 This was also Walmart Canada s first logo used from 1994 2001  Very few locations still use this logo  Wal Mart s former logo  1992 2008 in the US  2001 2009 in Canada  and 1992 2009 in Mexico   though it is still seen on many American locations  though a majority of Canadian locations have this logo instead of the 1994 2001 logo with a hyphen  The company was incorporated as Wal Mart Stores  Inc  on October 31  1969  In 1970  it opened its home office and first distribution center in Bentonville  Arkansas  It had 38 stores operating with 1 500 employees and sales of  44 2 million  It began trading stock as a publicly held company on October 1  1970  and was soon listed on the New York Stock Exchange  The first stock split occurred in May 1971 at a market price of  47  By this time  Wal Mart was operating in five states  Arkansas  Kansas  Louisiana  Missouri  and Oklahoma  it entered Tennessee in 1973 and Kentucky and Mississippi in 1974  As it moved into Texas in 1975  there were 125 stores with 7 500 employees and total sales of  340 3 million  10  Wal Mart opened its first Texas store in Mount Pleasant on November 11  1975  11  In the 1980s  Walmart continued to grow rapidly  and by its 25th anniversary in 1987 there were 1 198 stores with sales of  15 9 billion and 200 000 associates  10  This year also marked the completion of the company s satellite network  a  24 million investment linking all operating units of the company with its Bentonville office via two way voice and data transmission and one way video communication  At the time  it was the largest private satellite network  allowing the corporate office to track inventory and sales and to instantly communicate to stores  12  In 1988  Sam Walton stepped down as CEO and was replaced by David Glass  13  Walton remained as Chairman of the Board  and the company also rearranged other people in senior positions  Inside a Walmart Supercenter in West Plains  Missouri In 1988  the first Walmart Supercenter opened in Washington  Missouri  14  Thanks to its superstores  it surpassed Toys  R  Us in toy sales in the late 1990s  15  The company also opened overseas stores  entering South America in 1995 with stores in Argentina and Brazil  and Europe in 1999  buying Asda in the UK for  10 billion  16  In 1998  Walmart introduced the  Neighborhood Market  concept with three stores in Arkansas  17  By 2005  estimates indicate that the company controlled about 20  of the retail grocery and consumables business  18  In 2000  H  Lee Scott became President and CEO  and Walmart s sales increased to  165 billion  19  In 2002  it was listed for the first time as America s largest corporation on the Fortune 500 list  with revenues of  219 8 billion and profits of  6 7 billion  It has remained there every year  except for 2006  20  21  In 2005  Walmart had  312 4 billion in sales  more than 6 200 facilities around the world including 3 800 stores in the United States and 2 800 elsewhere  employing more than 1 6 million  associates  worldwide  Its U S  presence grew so rapidly that only small pockets of the country remained further than 60 miles  100 km  from the nearest Wal Mart  22  As Walmart grew rapidly into the world s largest corporation  many critics worried about the effect of its stores on local communities  particularly small towns with many  mom and pop  stores  There have been several studies on the economic impact of Walmart on small towns and local businesses  jobs  and taxpayers  In one  Kenneth Stone  a Professor of Economics at Iowa State University  found that some small towns can lose almost half of their retail trade within ten years of a Wal Mart store opening  23  However  in another study  he compared the changes to what small town shops had faced in the past   including the development of the railroads  the advent of the Sears Roebuck catalog  as well as the arrival of shopping malls   and concluded that shop owners who adapt to changes in the retail market can thrive after Wal Mart arrives  23  A later study in collaboration with Mississippi State University showed that there are  both positive and negative impacts on existing stores in the area where the new supercenter locates   24  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in September 2005  Walmart was able to use its logistical efficiency in organizing a rapid response to the disaster  donating  20 million in cash  1 500 truckloads of free merchandise  food for 100 000 meals  as well as the promise of a job for every one of its displaced workers  25  An independent study by Steven Horwitz of St  Lawrence University found that Walmart  The Home Depot and Lowe s made use of their local knowledge about supply chains  infrastructure  decision makers and other resources to provide emergency supplies and reopen stores well before FEMA began its response  26  While the company was overall lauded for its quick response   amidst the criticisms of the Federal Emergency Management Agency   several critics were nonetheless quick to point out that there still remain issues with the company s labor relations  27  Initiatives In October 2005  Walmart announced it would implement several environmental measures to increase energy efficiency  The primary goals included spending  500 million a year to increase fuel efficiency in Walmart s truck fleet by 25  over three years and double it within ten  reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20  in seven years  reduce energy use at stores by 30   and cut solid waste from U S  stores and Sam s Clubs by 25  in three years  CEO Lee Scott said that Walmart s goal was to be a  good steward for the environment  and ultimately use only renewable energy sources and produce zero waste  28  The company also designed three new experimental stores in McKinney  Texas  Aurora  Colorado  and Las Vegas  Nevada  with wind turbines  photovoltaic solar panels  biofuel capable boilers  water cooled refrigerators  and xeriscape gardens  29  Despite much criticism of its environmental record  Walmart took a few steps in what is viewed as a positive direction  which included becoming the biggest seller of organic milk and the biggest buyer of organic cotton in the world  as well as reducing packaging and energy costs  30  Wal Mart also spent nearly a year working with outside consultants to discover the company s total environmental impact and find where they could improve  They discovered  for example  that by eliminating excess packaging on their toy line Kid Connection  they could not only save  2 4 million a year in shipping costs but also 3 800 trees and a million barrels of oil  30  Walmart has also recently created its own electric company in Texas  Texas Retail Energy  and plans to supply its stores with cheap power purchased at wholesale prices  Through this new venture  the company expects to save  15 million annually and also lays the groundwork and infrastructure to sell electricity to Texas consumers in the future  31  In March 2006  Walmart sought to appeal to a more affluent demographic  The company launched a new Supercenter concept in Plano  Texas  intended to compete against stores seen as more upscale and appealing  such as Target  32  33  The new store has wood floors  wider aisles  a sushi bar  a coffee sandwich shop with free Wi Fi Internet access  and more expensive beers  wines  electronics  and other goods  The exterior has a hunter green background behind the Walmart letters  similar to Neighborhood Market by Walmarts  instead of the blue previously used at its supercenters  On September 12  2007  Walmart introduced new advertising with the slogan   Save Money Live Better   replacing the  Always Low Prices  Always  slogan  which it had used for the previous 19 years  Global Insight  which conducted the research that supported the ads  found that Walmart s price level reduction resulted in savings for consumers of  287 billion in 2006  which equated to  957 per person or  2 500 per household  up 7 3  from the 2004 savings estimate of  2 329   34  On June 30  2008  Walmart unveiled a new company logo  featuring the non hyphenated name  Walmart  and in place of the star  a symbol that resembles a sunburst or flower  The new logo received mixed reviews from some design critics  who questioned whether the new logo was as bold as competitors  such as the Target bullseye or as instantly recognizable as the former company logo  which was used for 18 years  35  The new logo made its debut on the company s walmart com website on July 1  2008  Walmart s U S  locations were to update store logos in the fall of 2008  as part of an ongoing evolution of its overall brand  36  Wal Mart Canada started to adopt the logo for its stores in early 2009  On March 20  2009  Walmart announced that it is paying a combined  933 6 million in bonuses to every full and part time hourly worker of the company  An additional  788 8 million in profit sharing  401 k  contributions  and hundreds of millions of dollars in merchandise discounts and contributions to the employees  stock purchase plan is

 2009   with  401 2 billion in net sales  a gain of 7 2  from the prior year  Income from continuing operations increased 3  to  13 3 billion  and earnings per share rose 6  to  3 35  37  On July 16

expanded to all stores in Florida by January 2007  While the average price of generics is  29 per prescription  compared to  102 for name brand drugs  Walmart maintains that it is not selling at a loss  or providing as an act of charity   instead  they are using the same mechanisms of mass distribution that it uses to bring lower prices to other products  43  While it s little known outside of the drug industry  many of Walmart s low cost generics are imported from India and made by drug makers in the country including drug majors Ranbaxy and Cipla  44  On February 6  2007  the company

billion   750 million   71  72  Several reasons led to Wal mart s failure in the German market  The German market at this point was an oligopoly with high competition among the companies which also used a similar low price strategy as Wal mart  Because of this  Wal mart s low price strategy yielded no competitive advantage  Also Wal mart s corporate culture was not viewed positively among employees and customers in Germany  particularly Wal mart s  statement of ethics   which restricted relationships between employees and led to a public discussion in the media  resulting in a bad reputation for Wal mart among customers  73  74  Also Wal mart s  Big Box   Low Price  Model  a price strategy that works well in the U S   was not successful in Germany  In July 2006  Wal Mart announced its withdrawal from Germany due to sustained losses  The stores were sold to the German company Metro during Wal Mart s fiscal third quarter  75  76   Wal mart did not disclose its losses

the company teamed with Procter  amp  Gamble to produce Secrets of the Mountain and The Jensen Project  two hour family movies which featured the characters using Walmart and Procter  amp  Gamble branded products  The Jensen Project also featured a preview of a product to be released in several months in Walmart stores  92  93  A third movie  A Walk in My Shoes  will air later in 2010 and a fourth is in production  94  Walmart s director of brand marketing also serves as co chair of the Association of National Advertisers s Alliance for Family Entertainment  95  Corporate affairs Walmart Home Office in Bentonville  Arkansas Walmart is headquartered in the Wal Mart Home Office complex in Bentonville  Arkansas  The company s business model is based on selling a wide variety of general merchandise at  always low prices   42  They refer to their employees as  associates   All Wal Mart stores in the US and Canada also have designated  greeters  at the store entrance  a practice pioneered by founder Sam Walton and later copied by other retailers  Greeters are trained to help shoppers find what they want and answer their questions  96  For many years  associates were identified in the store by their signature blue vest  but this was discontinued in June 2007 and replaced with more modern and professional khaki pants and polo shirts  The wardrobe change was part of a larger corporate overhaul for the store in an effort to increase sales and rejuvenate its stock price  97  Unlike many other retailers  Wal Mart does not charge a slotting fee to suppliers for their products to appear in the store  98  Instead  it focuses on selling more popular products and provides incentives for store managers to drop unpopular products  as well as asking manufacturers to supply more popular products  98  On September 14  2006  the company announced that it would phase out its layaway program  citing declining use and increased costs  99  Layaway ceased to be offered on November 19  2006  and required merchandise pickup by December 8  2006  Wal Mart now focuses on other payment options  such as increased use of six  and twelve month  zero interest financing  The layaway location in most stores is now used for Wal Mart s Site To Store program  which was introduced in March 2007  This enables walmart com customers to buy goods online with a free shipping option  and have goods shipped to the nearest store for pickup  100  Finance and governance For the fiscal year ending January 31  2011  Wal Mart reported a net income of  15 4 billion on  422 billion of revenue with a 24 7  gross profit margin   The corporation s international operations accounted for  109 2 billion  or 26 1   of total sales  1  It is the world s 18th largest public corporation  according to the Forbes Global 2000 list  and the largest public corporation when ranked by revenue  101  Wal Mart is governed by a fifteen member Board of Directors  which is elected annually by shareholders  Robson Walton  the eldest son of founder Sam Walton  serves as Chairman of the Board  Michael T  Duke serves as Chief Executive Officer  CEO   and Lee Scott  formerly CEO  serves as Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board  Other members of the board include A da  lvarez  Jim Breyer  M  Michele Burns  James Cash  Roger Corbett  Douglas Daft  David Glass  Gregory B  Penner  Allen Questrom  Arne M  Sorenson  Jim Walton  Christopher J  Williams  and Linda S  Wolf  1  Sam Walton died in 1992  After Walton s death  Don Soderquist  Chief Operating Officer and Senior Vice Chairman  became known as the  Keeper of the Culture   102  Notable former members of the board include Hillary Clinton  1985 1992  103  and Tom Coughlin  2003 2004   the latter having served as Vice Chairman  Clinton left the board before the 1992 U S  Presidential Election  and Coughlin left in December 2005 after pleading guilty to wire fraud and tax evasion for stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from Wal Mart  104  On August 11  2006  he was sentenced to 27 months of home confinement  five years of probation  and ordered to pay US 411 000 in restitution  105  Competition In North America  Wal Mart s primary competition includes department stores like Kmart  Target  ShopKo and Meijer  Canada s Zellers  Hart the Real Canadian Superstore and Giant Tiger  and Mexico s Comercial Mexicana and Soriana  Competitors of Wal Mart s Sam s Club division are Costco  and the smaller BJ s Wholesale Club chain operating mainly in the eastern US  Wal Mart s move into the grocery business in the late 1990s also set it against major supermarket chains in both the United States and Canada  Several smaller retailers  primarily dollar stores  such as Family Dollar and Dollar General  have been able to find a small niche market and compete successfully against Wal Mart for home consumer sales  106  In 2004  Wal Mart responded by testing its own dollar store concept  a subsection of some stores called  Pennies n Cents   107  Wal Mart also had to face fierce competition in some foreign markets  For example  in Germany it had captured just 2  of German food market following its entry into the market in 1997 and remained  a secondary player  behind Aldi with a 19  share  108  In July 2006  Wal Mart announced its withdrawal from Germany  Its stores were sold to German company Metro  76  Wal Mart continues to do well in the UK  and its Asda subsidiary is the second largest chain after Tesco  109  In May 2006  after entering the South Korean market in 1998  Wal Mart withdrew and sold all 16 of its South Korean outlets to Shinsegae  a local retailer  for  882 million  Shinsegae re branded the Wal Marts as E mart stores  110  Wal Mart struggled to export its brand elsewhere as it rigidly tried to reproduce its model overseas  In China  Wal Mart hopes to succeed by adapting and doing things preferable to Chinese citizens  For example  it found that Chinese consumers preferred to select their own live fish and seafood  stores began displaying the meat uncovered and installed fish tanks  leading to higher sales  111  Customer base Street sign for Wal   Mart Drive near Gordon  Pennsylvania A price of 15 cents on folders and notebooks Each week  about 100 million customers  nearly one third of the U S  population  visit Walmart s U S  stores  112  Walmart customers give low prices as the most important reason for shopping there  reflecting the  Low prices  always  advertising slogan that Wal Mart used from 1962 until 2006  113  The average US Wal Mart customer s income is below the national average  and analysts recently estimated that more than one fifth of them lack a bank account  twice the national rate  114  A Wal Mart financial report in 2006 also indicated that Wal Mart customers are sensitive to higher utility costs and gas prices  115  A poll indicated that after 2004 US Presidential Election 76  of voters who shopped at Wal Mart once a week voted for George W  Bush  while only 23  supported senator John Kerry  116  When measured against other similar retailers in the U S   frequent Wal Mart shoppers were rated the most politically conservative  117  In 2006  Wal Mart took steps to expand its US customer base  announcing a modification in its US stores from a  one size fits all  merchandising strategy to one designed to  reflect each of six demographic groups   African Americans  the affluent  empty nesters  Hispanics  suburbanites and rural residents   118  Around six months later  it unveiled a new slogan   Saving people money so they can live better lives   This reflects the three main groups into which Wal Mart categorizes its 200 million customers   brand aspirationals   people with low incomes who are obsessed with names like KitchenAid    price sensitive affluents   wealthier shoppers who love deals   and  value price shoppers   people who like low prices and cannot afford much more   113  Wal Mart has also made steps to appeal to more liberal customers  for example  by rejecting the American Family Association s recommendations and carrying the DVD Brokeback Mountain  a love story between two gay cowboys in Wyoming  119  Economic impact See also  Criticism of Wal Mart Kenneth Stone  Professor of Economics at Iowa State University  in a paper published in Farm Foundation in 1997  found that some small towns can lose almost half of their retail trade within ten years of a Wal Mart store opening  23  He compared the changes to previous competitors small town shops have faced in the past from the development of the railroads and the Sears Roebuck catalog to shopping malls  He concludes that small towns are more affected by  discount mass merchandiser stores  than larger towns and that shop owners who adapt to the ever changing retail market can  co exist and even thrive in this type of environment   23  One study found Wal Mart s entry into a new market has a profound impact on its retail competition  When a Wal Mart opens in a new market  median sales drop 40  at similar high volume stores  17  at supermarkets and 6  at drugstores  according to the June 2009 study by researchers at several universities and led by the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College  120  A Loyola University Chicago study suggested that the impact a Wal Mart store has on a local business is correlated to its distance from that store  The leader of that study admits that this factor is stronger in smaller towns and doesn t apply to more urban areas saying  It d be so tough to nail down what s up with Wal Mart   121  A June 2006 article published by the libertarian Ludwig von Mises Institute suggested that Wal Mart has a positive impact on small business  122  It argued that while Wal Mart s low prices caused some existing businesses to close  the chain also created new opportunities for other small business  and so  the process of creative destruction unleashed by Wal Mart has no statistically significant impact on the overall size of the small business sector in the United States   123  For the concern of jobs  a study commissioned by Wal Mart with consulting firm Global Insight  found that its stores  presence saves working families more than US 2 500 per year  while creating more than 210 000 jobs in the U S  124  125  Alternately  the Economic Policy Institute estimates that between 2001 and 2006  Wal Mart s trade deficit with China alone eliminated nearly 200 000 U S  jobs  126  Another study at the University of Missouri found that a new store increases net retail employment in the county by 100 jobs in the short term  half of which disappear over five years as other retail establishments close  127  Studies of Wal Mart show consumers benefit from lower costs  Another study by Global Insight found that Wal Mart s growth between 1985 and 2004 resulted in food at home prices that were 9 1  lower and overall prices  as measured by the Consumer Price Index  that were 3 1  lower than they would otherwise have been  128  A 2005 Washington Post story reported that  Wal Mart s discounting on food alone boosts the welfare of American shoppers by at least  50 billion per year   129  A study in 2005 at Massachusetts Institute of Technology measured the effect on consumer welfare and found that the poorest segment of the population benefits the most from the existence of discount retailers  130  A 2004 paper by two professors at Pennsylvania State University found that U S  counties with Wal Mart stores suffered increased poverty compared with counties without Wal Marts  131  They hypothesized  to explain their results  This could be due to the displacement of workers from higher paid jobs in the retailers customers no longer choose to patronize  Wal Mart providing less local charity than the replaced businesses  or a shrinking pool of local leadership and reduced social capital due to a reduced number of local independent businesses  131  Dr Raj Patel  author of Stuffed and Starved  Markets  Power and the Hidden Battle for the World Food System  said in a lecture at the University of Melbourne on 18 September 2007  that a study in Nebraska looked at two different Wal Marts  the first of which had just arrived and  was in the process of driving everyone else out of business but  to do that  they cut their prices to the bone  very  very low prices   In the other Wal Mart   they had successfully destroyed the local economy  there was a sort of economic crater with Wal Mart in the middle  and  in that community  the prices were 17 per cent higher   132  Employee and labor relations See also  Criticism of Walmart A protest in Utah against Wal Mart Labor unions  Christian organizations  133  134  and environmental groups 135  have criticized Wal Mart for its policies and or business practices  In particular  several labor unions blame Wal Mart workers  unwillingness to join their organizations on the company s anti union stance  Others disapprove of the corporation s extensive foreign product sourcing  treatment of employees and product suppliers  environmental practices  and use of public subsidies  and the impact of stores on the local economies of towns in which they operate  136  137  138  In 2005  two national campaigns to criticize Wal Mart were launched  the  United Food and Commercial Workers  launched Wake Up Wal Mart and The Center for Community and Corporate Ethics launched Wal Mart Watch  139  140  By the end of 2005  Wal Mart launched Working Families for Wal Mart  an operation managed by Wal Mart to tell the company s side of the story  Additional efforts to counter criticism included a PR campaign in 2005  managed through its PR website walmartfacts com  141  as well as several television commercials  The company retained the PR firm Edelman to respond to negative media attention  142  and started interacting directly with bloggers by sending them news  suggesting topics for postings  and sometimes inviting them to visit its corporate headquarters  143  Similarly  in 2010  several of Wal Mart s opponents have hired The Saint Consulting Group to support grass roots campaigns against Wal Mart  The most notable of these include grocery chains such as Safeway Inc   SuperValu  and Ahold  concerned that the presence of Wal Mart will add more competition to their operations  144  In June 2006  Walmart was excluded from the investment portfolio of The Government Pension Fund of Norway  which held stock values of about US  430 million in the company  due to a social audit into alleged labor rights violations in the company s operations in the US and worldwide  145  146  Although Walmart did not respond to questions from the fund s auditors  the company later claimed the decision  don t appear to be based on complete information   147  In the past  Wal mart has been accused of locking night shift workers in at night  148  paying employees below minimum wage  and exposing employees to health hazards  146  Wal Mart s own  Standards for Suppliers  reports document extensive problems of this kind among the company s  directly sourced  factories  149  Full time Wal Mart employees earn an average of  10 78 per hour  but critics point out that the starting pay can be far lower   placing some employees with children below the poverty line   and that payrates do not rise as quickly as with unionized companies  150  Others decry low levels of health coverage or overpriced health insurance  though the company reports that it offers rates as low as  5 per month in some areas   9 per month nationwide  and that 92  of its associates are insured  though not necessarily through Wal Mart   151  Other grievances regard poor working conditions  unfavorable employer employee relationships  and anti union policies  Many suggest that Wal Mart s high annual turnover rate of  70  shows that workers are dissatisfied and maltreated  150  In response  Jay Nordlinger of National Review argues that Wal Mart is attacked simply because it is a leader of the Fortune 500 list or the largest employer in America  and a  free market success story   152 Penn  amp  Teller devoted an episode of Bullshit  to an analysis of Wal Mart criticism as a social movement  They theorized that despite the noble rhetoric  the real motivation of  Wal Mart haters  was rooted in human psychology  They suggested that hating Wal Mart permits a person  to feel better about themselves  for three main reasons  They  don t run a greedy international conglomerate   they aren t Wal Mart workers  widely considered  low skilled  minimum wage drones   and they aren t Wal Mart customers thought of as  toothless  welfare getting hillbillies   153  Wal Mart stores are unionized in every country outside of North America  154  Wal Mart has opposed the Employee Free Choice Act  EFCA   which would make it easier for workers to unionize by removing the employer s ability to demand a secret ballot in union elections  and which would require mandatory arbitration of labor disputes  In mid 2008  the company required store managers and department heads to attend meetings at which opposition to the EFCA was used as a fulcrum for criticism of Democratic candidates in the elections for the United States Senate and the House of Representatives  as well as of the presumptive Democratic Presidential nominee  Senator Barack Obama  At these meetings  Wal Mart human resources managers warned that Democratic victories might result in passage of the EFCA and hence more unionization  At one meeting  a Wal Mart customer service supervisor from Missouri stated   I am not telling you how to vote  but if the Democrats win  this bill will pass and you won t have a vote on whether you want a union  155  A Wal Mart spokesman  while acknowledging that the meetings were taking place nationwide  said   If anyone representing Wal Mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote  they were wrong and acting without approval   155  Several labor rights groups including the AFL CIO have asked the Federal Election Commission to investigate whether Wal Mart broke federal election rules by advocating against Democratic candidate Barack Obama in meetings with employees  156  The Wal Mart store in Quanzhou  Fujian  China According to a Newsweek article  Wal Mart  after years of fierce fighting  accepted organized labor in China  Labor unions in China do not negotiate contracts  but rather they are an arm of the state  to secure the social order  and provide funding to the Communist Party  157  In 2011  Wal Mart sub contractors  Impact Logistics and Premiere Warehousing Ventures  which were employed through Schneider Logistics warehouses in Mira Loma  California were fined by the California State Labor Department for disregarding federal and state wage laws  158   California Labor Commissioner Julie Su said in an interview that the Schneider facility on South Hamner Avenue is actually two buildings  and that most of the goods that move through the distribution center go to area Wal  Mart stores   159   Warehouse Workers United  WWU  filed a complaint with Wal Mart CEO Mike Duke  October  2011  and with the Wal Mart Ethics Office  January  2012  noting that the conditions in this warehouse violate Wal Mart s own  Statement of Ethics    The complaint details widespread wage theft resulting from a piece rate system for unloading containers  failure to pay employees for the time they actually worked and other violations of state and federal wage and hour law   In response  WWU received a  Dear Customer  letter from Wal Mart    160  Gender and sexual orientation In 2007  a gender discrimination lawsuit  Dukes v  Wal Mart Stores  Inc   was filed against Walmart  alleging that female employees were discriminated against in matters regarding pay and promotions  A class action suit was sought  which would have been the nation s largest in history  covering 1 5 million past and current employees of Wal Mart  161  On June 20  2011  the United States Supreme Court ruled in Wal Mart s favor  stating that the plaintiffs did not have enough in common to constitute a class  162  The court ruled unanimously that because of the variability of the plaintiffs  circumstances  the class action could not proceed as presented  and furthermore  in a 5 4 decision that it could not proceed as any kind of class action suit  163  However  several plaintiffs  including Ms  Dukes  still intend to file individual discrimination lawsuits separately  164  According to a consultant hired by plaintiffs in a sex discrimination lawsuit  in 2001  Wal Mart s EEOC filings showed that female employees made up 65  of Wal Mart s hourly paid workforce  but only 33  of its management  165  166  Just 35  of its store managers were women  whereas 57  were at comparable retailers  166  Wal Mart says comparisons with other retailers are unfair  because it classifies employees differently  if department managers were included in the totals  women would make up 60  of the managerial ranks  166  Others have criticized the lawsuit as without basis in the law and as an abuse of the class action mechanism  167  168  169  In 2007  Wal Mart was named by the National Association for Female Executives as one of the top 35 companies for Executive Women  170  Wal Mart s rating on the Human Rights Campaign s Corporate Equality Index  a measure of how companies treat LGBT employees and customers  has fluctuated widely during the past decade  from a low of 14   2002  to 65   2006   They were praised for expanding their antidiscrimination policy protecting gay and lesbian employees  171  as well as for a new definition of  family  that included same sex partners  172  173  However  they have been criticized in other areas  such as not renewing its membership in the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce  which is reflected in their 2008 rating of 40   compared to Target at 80  and Kmart at 100    174  In January 2006  Wal Mart announced that  diversity efforts include new groups of minority  female and gay employees that meet at Wal Mart headquarters in Bentonville to advise the company on marketing and internal promotion  There are seven Business Resource Groups  women  African Americans  Hispanics  Asians  Native Americans  Gays and Lesbians  and a disabled group   175  Beating Walmart A Chinese counterfeit    See also Arkansas portal
