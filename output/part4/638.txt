refers to an ongoing political and social debate regarding both the restriction and availability of firearms within the United States  It has long been among the most controversial and intractable issues in American politics  1  For the last several decades  the debate has been characterized by a stalemate between an individual right to bear arms based on the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and the responsibility of government to prevent crime  maintain order and protect the wellbeing of its citizens  2  3  In District of Columbia v  Heller  554 U S  570  2008   the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Second Amendment protects the right of an individual to own a firearm for the purposes of self defense within the home  while at the same time reaffirming the constitutionality of a wide range of long standing gun control laws  4  Repeated polling has found that a majority of Americans believe the constitution ensures their right to own a gun  5  6  and a majority also supports stricter enforcement of current laws  7  However  only 43 percent believe new laws would be more effective than better enforcement of existing laws in reducing gun violence in the United States  7  Contents 1 Gun culture 1 1 Origins 1 2 Popular culture 1 3 Economics 2 History 2 1 Revolutionary War 2 2 Jacksonian era 2 3 Antebellum era 2 4 Reconstruction era

Culture   historian Richard Hofstadter popularized the phrase gun culture to describe the long held affections for firearms within America  many citizens embracing and celebrating the association of guns and America s heritage  8  The right to own a gun and defend oneself is considered by some  especially those in the West and South  9  as a central tenet of the American identity  This stems in part from the nation s frontier history  where guns were integral to westward expansion  enabling settlers to guard themselves from Native Americans  animals and foreign armies  frontier citizens often assuming responsibility for self protection  The importance of guns also derives from the role of hunting in American culture  which remains popular as a sport in the country today  10  The viewpoint that firearms were an integral part of the settling of the United States has the least level of support in urban and industrialized regions  10  Where a cultural tradition of conflating violence and associating gun ownership with the  redneck  stereotype has played a part in promoting the support of gun regulation  11  In 1995  the Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco  and Firearms  whose employees routinely carry such weapons in the line of duty  estimated that the number of firearms available in the US was 223 million  12  About 25  of the adults in the United States personally own a gun  the vast majority of them men  13  About half of the adult U S  population lived in households with guns  14  Less than half of gun owners say that the primary reason they own a gun is for self protection against crime  reflecting a popularity of hunting and sport shooting among gun owners  As hunting and sport shooting tends to favor rural areas  naturally the bulk of gun owners generally live in rural areas and small towns  13  This attribute associates with low involvement in criminal violence  and therefore most guns are in the hands of people who are unlikely to misuse them and who tend to not have criminal records  13  Guns are prominent in contemporary U S  popular culture as well  appearing frequently in movies  television  music  books  and magazines  15   edit  Origins The origins of American gun culture can be traced back to  the American Revolutionary War  hunting sporting ethos and the militia frontier ethos that draw from the country s early history  3  Calamity Jane  notable pioneer frontierswoman and scout  at age 43  Photo by H R  Locke  The American hunting sporting passion comes from a time when the United States was an agrarian  subsistence nation where hunting was an auxiliary source of food for some settlers  and also a deterrence to animal predators  A connection between shooting skills and survival among rural American men was in many cases a  rite of passage  for those entering manhood  Today  hunting survives as a central sentimental component of a gun culture as a way to control animal populations across the country  regardless of modern trends away from subsistence hunting and rural living  3  The militia frontiersman spirit derives from an early American dependence on arms to protect themselves from hostile Native Americans and foreign armies  Survival depended upon everyone being capable of carrying a weapon  In the 18th century  there was neither budget nor manpower nor government desire to maintain a full time army  believing they were a threat to the rights of the civilian populace  Therefore  the armed citizen soldier carried the responsibility  Service in militia  including providing his own ammunition and weapons  was mandatory for all men  Yet  as early as the 1790s  the mandatory universal militia duty gave way to voluntary militia units and a reliance on a regular army  with a decline of the importance of militia trend continuing throughout the 19th century  3  Closely related to the militia tradition was the frontier tradition  with the Nineteenth Century westward expansion closely associated with firearms  Regardless  today  there remains a powerful central elevation of the gun associated with the hunting sporting and militia frontier ethos among the American Gun Culture  3  Though it has not been a necessary part of daily survival for a long time  generations of Americans have continued to embrace and glorify it as a living inheritance a permanent element of the nation s style and culture  16   edit  Popular culture The gun has long been a symbol of power and masculinity  17  In popular literature  frontier adventure was most famously told by James Fenimore Cooper  who is credited by Petri Liukkonen with creating the archetype of an 18th century frontiersman through such novels as  The Last of the Mohicans   1826  and  The Deerslayer   1840   18  A handbill for Buffalo Bill s Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World In the late 19th century  cowboy and Wild West imagery entered the collective imagination  The first American female superstar  Annie Oakley  was a sharpshooter who toured the country starting in 1885  performing in Buffalo Bill s Wild West show  The cowboy archetype of individualist hero was established largely by Owen Wister in stories and novels  most notably  The Virginian   1902   following close on the heels of Theodore Roosevelt s  The Winning of the West   1889 1895   a history of the early frontier  19  20  21  Cowboys were also popularized in turn of the 20th century cinema  notably through such early classics as  The Great Train Robbery   1903  and  A California Hold Up   1906   the most commercially successful film of the pre nickelodeon era  22  Gangster films began appearing as early as 1910  but became popular only with the advent of sound in film in the 1930s  The genre was boosted by the events of the prohibition era  such as bootlegging and the St  Valentine s Day Massacre of 1929  the existence of real life gangsters  e g   Al Capone  and the rise of contemporary organized crime and escalation of urban violence  These movies flaunted the archetypal exploits of  swaggering  cruel  wily  tough  and law defying bootleggers and urban gangsters   23  With the arrival of World War II  Hollywood produced many morale boosting movies  patriotic rallying cries that affirmed a sense of national purpose  The image of the lone cowboy was replaced in these combat films by stories that emphasized group efforts and the value of individual sacrifices for a larger cause  often featuring a group of men from diverse ethnic backgrounds who were thrown together  tested on the battlefield  and molded into a dedicated fighting unit  24  Guns frequently accompanied famous heroes and villains in late 20th century American films  from the outlaws of Bonnie and Clyde  1967  and The Godfather  1972   to the fictitious law and order avengers like Dirty Harry  1971  and RoboCop  1987   In the 1970s  films portrayed fictitious and exaggerated characters  madmen ostensibly produced by the Vietnam war in films like Taxi Driver  1976  and Apocalypse Now  1979   while other films told stories of fictitious veterans who were supposedly victims of the war and in need of rehabilitation  Coming Home and The Deer Hunter  both 1978   25  Many action films continue to celebrate the gun toting hero in fantastical settings  At the same time  the negative role of the gun in fictionalized modern urban violence has been explored in films like Boyz n the Hood  1991  and Menace 2 Society  1993    edit  Economics Like all markets the market for firearms is driven by the economic law of supply and demand  Where there is a demand and resources to provide for that demand a supply will exist  This is the same economic law which drives all free market economies and where those free markets are over controlled black market economies will develop  Historically the economic examples of these controls have typically revolved around tariffs on imported goods  The illicit markets in prohibition era alcohol  recreational drugs  gambling and prostitution are examples of unregulated black markets which have developed in response to moral regulations on markets  Currently 28  of the economy of the United States  about 4 trillion dollars per year  is based on uncontrolled black markets  Leaving these markets un controlled  un regulated and un taxed represents a revenue loss of about 1 3 trillion dollars or about the amount of the current U S  budget deficit   26  The best modern example of black market firearms production is the construction of underground ammunition and firearms factories in Israel during the British occupation   27  During the Assault Weapons Ban in the United States there was a significant increase in the number of legal  home manufactured  firearms  In response to increased global regulation there has been an increase in world wide illicit firearms manufacturing  Responding to this unregulated market in firearms the UN has developed the  UN Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms   28  There is no reason to believe that the growing black market in firearms will respond any differently than other black markets   edit  History  edit  Revolutionary War Gun politics as a political issue dates to the earliest days of the United States   Lexington Minuteman representing militia minuteman John Parker  Statue is by Henry Hudson Kitson and it stands at the town green of Lexington  Massachusetts   In the years prior to the Revolutionary War  the British  in response to the colonists  unhappiness over increasingly direct control and taxation of the colonies  imposed a powder embargo on the colonies in an attempt to lessen the ability of the colonists to resist British encroachments into what the colonies regarded as local matters  Two direct attempts to disarm the colonial militias fanned what had been a smoldering resentment of British interference into the fires of war  These two incidents were the attempt to confiscate the cannon of the Concord and Lexington militias  leading to the Battles of Lexington and Concord of April 19  1775  and the attempt  on April 20  to confiscation militia powder stores in the armory of Williamsburg  Virginia  which led to the Gunpowder Incident and a face off between Patrick Henry and hundreds of militia members on one side and the Royal Governor of Virginia  Lord Dunmore  and British seamen on the other  The Gunpowder Incident was eventually settled by paying the colonists for the powder  29  Minutemen were members of teams of select men from the American colonial militia during the American Revolutionary War who vowed to be ready for battle against the British within one minute of receiving notice citation needed   On the night of April 18 April 19  1775  minuteman Paul Revere  William Dawes  and Dr  Samuel Prescott spread the news that  the Red Coats are coming    citation needed  Paul Revere was captured before completing his mission when the British marched towards the arsenal in Lexington and Concord to collect the patriots  weapons  Only Dr  Prescott was able to complete the journey to Concord  30  The right to firearms was thus an issue in America from the very beginning   edit  Jacksonian era Painting of President Andrew Jackson based on 1824 study portrait by Thomas Sully  The Jacksonian Era lasted roughly from President Andrew Jackson s 1828 election until the slavery issue became dominant after 1850  French aristocrat Alexis de Tocqueville traveled in America early during this era  and according to Tocqueville  a distinguishing characteristic of American society in the 1830s  the era of Jacksonian democracy  was  a pervasive spirit of individualism   The French commentator confessed that individualism was a novel term coined to capture a new idea   31  During this same period  some of the first gun control laws were passed in the United States  and  as a result  the Individual Right interpretation of the Second Amendment began and grew in direct response to these early gun control laws  in keeping with this new  pervasive spirit of individualism   32  As noted by Cornell   Ironically  the first gun control movement helped give birth to the first self conscious gun rights ideology built around a constitutional right of individual self defense   32  The Individual Right interpretation of the Second Amendment first arose in Bliss v  Commonwealth  1822  KY   33  which evaluated the right to bear arms in defense of themselves and the state pursuant to Section 28 of the Second Constitution of Kentucky  1799   The right to bear arms in defense of themselves and the state was interpreted as an individual right  for the case of a concealed sword cane  This case has been described as about  a statute prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons  that  was violative of the Second Amendment    34  As noted in the Northern Kentucky Law Review Second Amendment Symposium  Rights in Conflict in the 1980 s  vol  10  no  1  1982  p  155   The first state court decision resulting from the  right to bear arms  issue was Bliss v  Commonwealth  The court held that  the right of citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State must be preserved entire         This holding was unique because it stated that the right to bear arms is absolute and unqualified   35  36  Also during the Jacksonian Era  the first Collective Right interpretation of the Second Amendment arose  In State v  Buzzard  1842  Ark   the Arkansas high court adopted a militia based  political right  reading of the right to bear arms under state law  and upheld the 21st section of the second article of the Arkansas Constitution that declared   that the free white men of this State shall have a right to keep and bear arms for their common defense   37  while rejecting a challenge to a statute prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons  The Arkansas high court declared  That the words  a well regulated militia being necessary for the security of a free State   and the words  common defense  clearly show the true intent and meaning of these Constitutions  i e   Ark  and U S   and prove that it is a political and not an individual right  and  of course  that the State  in her legislative capacity  has the right to regulate and control it  This being the case  then the people  neither individually nor collectively  have the right to keep and bear arms   Joel Prentiss Bishop s influential Commentaries on the Law of Statutory Crimes  1873  took Buzzard s militia based interpretation  a view that Bishop characterized as the  Arkansas doctrine   as the orthodox view of the right to bear arms in American law  37  38  The two early state court cases  Bliss and Buzzard  set the fundamental dichotomy in interpreting the Second Amendment  i e  whether it secured an Individual Right versus a Collective Right  A debate about how to interpret the Second Amendment evolved through the decades and remained unresolved until the 2008 District of Columbia v  Heller U S  Supreme Court decision   edit  Antebellum era Portrait of Dred Scott One of the early political battles over the right to firearms involved the rights of slaves to carry firearms in the United States  the battle over the rights of slaves resulted in political battles  in the aftermath of the 1856 Supreme Court decision Dred Scott v  Sandford that denied Negroes the full rights of citizenship  39  40  In Dred Scott v  Sandford  60 U S  393  1856   the  Dred Scott Decision    the Supreme Court indicated that   It would give to persons of the negro race  who were recognized as citizens in any one State of the Union     the full liberty     to keep and carry arms wherever they went   The Dred Scott Decision contains additional significant wording  More especially  it cannot be believed that the large slaveholding States regarded them as included in the word citizens  or would have consented to a Constitution which might compel them to receive them in that character from another State  For if they were so received  and entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens  it would exempt them from the operation of the special laws and from the police regulations which they considered to be necessary for their own safety  It would give to persons of the negro race  who were recognized as citizens in any one State of the Union  the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased  singly or in companies  without pass or passport  and without obstruction  to sojourn there as long as they pleased  to go where they pleased at every hour of the day or night without molestation  unless they committed some violation of law for which a white man would be punished  and it would give them the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak  to hold public meetings upon political affairs  and to keep and carry arms wherever they went  emphasis added    edit  Reconstruction era With the Civil War ending  the question of the rights of freed slaves to carry arms and to belong to militia came to the attention of the Federal courts  In response to the problems freed slaves faced in the Southern states  the Fourteenth Amendment was drafted  Representative John A  Bingham of Ohio  principal framer of the Fourteenth Amendment When the Fourteenth Amendment was drafted  Representative John A  Bingham of Ohio used the Court s own phrase  privileges and immunities of citizens  to include the first Eight Amendments of the Bill of Rights under its protection and guard these rights against state legislation  41  The debate in the Congress on the Fourteenth Amendment after the Civil War also concentrated on what the Southern States were doing to harm the newly freed slaves  One particular concern was the disarming of former slaves  The Second Amendment attracted serious judicial attention with the Reconstruction era case of United States v  Cruikshank which ruled that the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not cause the Bill of Rights  including the Second Amendment  to limit the powers of the State governments  stating that the Second Amendment  has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government   Akhil Reed Amar notes in the Yale Law Journal  the basis of Common Law for the first ten amendments of the U S  Constitution  which would include the Second Amendment   following John Randolph Tucker s famous oral argument in the 1887 Chicago anarchist Haymarket Riot case  Spies v  Illinois   Though originally the first ten Amendments were adopted as limitations on Federal power  yet in so far as they secure and recognize fundamental rights common law rights of the man  they make them privileges and immunities of the man as citizen of the United States    42   edit  20th century See also  Crime in the United States and Gun control policy of the Clinton Administration A famous and widely publicized case where fully automatic weapons were used in crime in the United States was during the Saint Valentine s Day massacre during the winter of 1929  this Prohibition era gangster sub machine gun mass murder led directly to the National Firearms Act of 1934  which was passed over a year after Prohibition had ended  Since 1934  fully automatic weapons have been heavily regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco and Firearms  ATF   but ones manufactured before May 19  1986 are available to citizens who are not otherwise prohibited  in those states that do not prohibit them  upon paying a  200 transfer tax  submission of a full set of fingerprints on FBI Form FD 258  certification provided by the local chief of police  sheriff of the county  head of the State police  or State or local district attorney or prosecutor  and approval by the BATF  43  44  Other crimes involving fully automatic weapons in the United States have not been as widely publicized since  45  However  the lesser known 1997 North Hollywood shootout involved two men carrying illegally imported automatic AKMs  46  In the latter half of the 20th Century  groups such as the National Rifle Association  NRA  and the Gun Owners of America  GOA  organized voters and campaign volunteers to focus citizen communication and interest when anti gun rights legislation was under consideration  both at federal and state levels  The United States was generally seen as having the least stringent anti gun rights laws in the developed world  with the possible exception of Switzerland  in part due to the strength of the gun lobby  particularly the NRA  47  The NRA historically supported gun laws intended to prevent criminals from obtaining firearms  while opposing new restrictions that affected law abiding citizens citation needed   An important electoral showdown over gun control came in 1970  when Senator Joseph Tydings  D  MD   who had highlighted crime in the District of Columbia and sponsored the Firearms Registration and Licensing Act  was defeated for reelection  The GOA grew out of dissatisfaction with the NRA  and historically rejected any gun laws that infringed the rights of law abiding citizens  putting it at odds with the NRA on many legislative issues  Besides the GOA  other national gun rights groups often took a stronger stance than the NRA  These groups criticize the NRA s history of support for some gun control legislation  such as the Gun Control Act of 1968  the ban on armor piercing projectiles  point of purchase background checks  NICS   Some of these groups are The Second Amendment Sisters  Second Amendment Foundation  and Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership  These groups  like the GOA  believe any compromise leads to incrementally greater restrictions  48  49  Chaos outside the Washington Hilton Hotel after the 1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan  James Brady and police officer Thomas Delahanty lie wounded on the ground  Handgun Control Inc   HCI   founded in 1974 by businessman Pete Shields  formed a partnership with the National Coalition to Ban Handguns  NCBH   also founded in 1974  Soon parting ways  the NCBH was renamed the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence in 1990  and while smaller than HCI  generally took a tougher stand on gun regulation than HCI  50  HCI saw an increase of interest and fund raising in the wake of the 1980 murder of John Lennon  By 1981 membership exceeded 100 000  Measured in dollars contributed to congressional campaigns  HCI contributed  75 000  Following the 1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan  and the resultant injury of James Brady  Sarah Brady joined the board of HCI in 1985  HCI was renamed in 2001 to Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence  51  In the 1990s  gun politics took a turn to the right in response to two high profile ATF incidents  Ruby Ridge and Waco  that led to mobilization of modern militia groups  52  These incidents combined with the passage of the Brady Act in 1993 and the Assault Weapons Ban a year later increased the fears of those who felt the Federal Government would confiscate their firearms  50  53  The Militia Movement expanded throughout the 1990s   edit  21st century Memorial on Virginia Tech s drillfield after the April 16  2007 Virginia Tech massacre One of the first major victories for gun rights advocates at the federal level came in 2004  when the Assault Weapons Ban was scheduled to expire by its own terms  Efforts by gun control advocates to extend the ban at the federal level failed  two later attempts to reestablish the ban also failed  The NRA opposed bans on handguns in Washington D C  and San Francisco  while also supporting the 2007 NICS Improvement Amendments Act  H R  2640   which strengthened requirements for background checks for firearm purchases  54  The GOA especially took issue with the NRA over a portion of the 2007  The School Safety And Law Enforcement Improvement Act  known as The NICS Improvement Amendments Act  which they termed the  Veteran s Disarmament Act   55  Besides the GOA  other national gun rights groups continue to take a stronger stance than the NRA  Groups such as The Second Amendment Sisters  Second Amendment Foundation  Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership  and the Pink Pistols continue much as they did in the late 20th Century  but new groups have also arisen  such as the Students for Concealed Carry  which grew largely out of perceived safety issues resulting from the creation of  Gun free  zones that were legislatively mandated at many schools  amidst a response to widely publicized school shootings  Even the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pitched in  with an extensive study on gun control 56  which found  Evidence was insufficient to determine the effectiveness of any of these laws   A similar survey of firearms research by the United States National Academy of Sciences arrived at nearly identical conclusions in 2004  57  Hattie Johnson of Idaho won a bronze medal in shooting at the 2003 Pan Am Games  In District of Columbia v  Heller  No  07 290  the United States Supreme Court held that Americans have an individual right described in the Second Amendment to possess firearms  for traditionally lawful purposes  such as self defense within the home   It is an appeal from Parker v  District of Columbia  478 F 3d 370  D C  Cir  2007   a decision in which the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit became the first federal appeals court in the United States to rule that a firearm ban infringes the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution  and the second to expressly interpret the Second Amendment as protecting an individual right to possess firearms for private use  The first federal case that interpreted the Second Amendment as protecting an individual right was United States v  Emerson  270 F 3d 203  5th Cir  2001   58  According to The Center for Public Integrity  145 groups are registered as making gun related filings to lobby Congress  the largest being the National Rifle Association  spending about  1 5 million per year  predominantly through two lobbying firms  the WPP Group and The Federalist Group  59  Ranked by total filings  gun rights lobbying exceeded gun control lobbying by the ratio of approximately 3 1  60  Measured in dollars  in 2007  gun rights political spending on lobbying totaled  1 959 407 versus gun control spending of  60 800  61  The NRA is the largest gun rights lobbying organization in the United States   edit  Regional and partisan divides See also  Concealed carry in the United States Regional differences tend to be greater than partisan ones for gun politics in the United States  Jurisdictions that favor gun control are concentrated in parts of the Northeastern United States such as New York  New Jersey  Massachusetts  the District of Columbia  and Maryland  but also include States with major metropolitan areas  notably California and Illinois  The Northwest  such as Montana  Idaho and Washington  the Deep South  including Alabama  Georgia and Florida  and the Southwest  such as Texas  New Mexico  and Utah tend to support gun rights  Other areas  including the Midwest and Plains States  are mixed  62  Alaska  Arizona and Vermont do not require any license in order to carry concealed weapons in public places  but there are laws in these states prohibiting concealed weapons in certain places  e g   in Alaska it is not permitted to carry a weapon  concealed or otherwise  into a bar or tavern   63  The spread of concealed carry laws since 1986 in those states that tend to be in support of gun rights has led to the widespread  legally permitted  carrying of concealed handguns by civilians in many parts of the United States  Opinions on gun control can vary within a jurisdiction  In general  large urban jurisdictions tend to favor gun control to reduce crime  while rural populations and small towns oppose it for much the same reason  The legal status of carrying concealed weapons is a political issue in many states  This roadside sign appears in a state that requires training and a permit to carry concealed weapons  Though gun control is not strictly a partisan issue  there is generally more support for gun control legislation in the Democratic Party than in the Republican Party  64  The Libertarian Party  whose campaign platforms favor classical liberal  i e  limited  government and individual rights  is outspokenly against gun control  and this stance is more ideological than the stance of the Republican Party  which represents people who tend to oppose gun regulations   edit  Types of firearms Political Scientist Earl Kruschke has described how  in the gun control debate  firearms have been viewed in only three general classes by gun control advocates  1  long guns 2  hand guns and 3  automatic and semi automatic weapons  The first category has generally been associated with sporting and hunting uses  the second category  handguns  describe weapons which can be held with one hand such as pistols and revolvers  and the third general category has been most commonly associated in public political perception with military uses  Notably the AR 15 and AK 47 style firearms have contributed to this perception  If sometimes confused in public debate  the two firearm types in the third general category are functionally and legally distinct  Fully automatic firearms of any kind  including military assault rifles  have been subject to requirements for registration by owners and licensing of dealers since the passage of the National Firearms Act in 1934  Further import restrictions were part of the Gun Control Act of 1968  and the transfer of newly manufactured machine guns to private citizens was banned with passage of the Firearm Owners Protection Act in 1986  New machine guns in the US are still legal for purchase by the military and by governmental agencies  including civilian law enforcement  pre 1986 registered machine guns are available to private citizens with federal registration  where permitted by state law   and have reached high market prices  eagerly sought by collectors because of their relative scarcity  An expansion has occurred in the number of states where such automatic weapons may legally be owned  for example  automatic weapons were recently legalized in Kansas  subject only to federal NFA regulations  65  Many semi automatic versions of military assault rifles and the larger 20  or 30 round magazines they typically use are again available for purchase by private citizens in the US  except where prohibited by state or municipal bans  since the  sunsetting  of the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban on September 14  2004  Some continue to be banned due to a 1989 amending of the Gun Control Act  which made some foreign made firearms illegal for importation  However  firearms similar to those affected by the importation ban can now be manufactured domestically  66  67  In general terms  gun control advocates have paid little concern to the long guns used for sporting purpose as long guns are generally not viewed as associated with violent crime or suicide  For example  in 2005  75  of the 10 100 homicides committed using firearms in the United States were committed using handguns  compared to 4  with rifles  5  with shotguns  and the rest with type of firearm not specified  68 Non criminal homicides  i e   acts of self defense  and criminal homicides were counted together simply as homicides in these data  68  Kruschke describes incidents where public political perceptions have been shaped by a few high profile violent crimes associated with automatic and semi automatic weapons  resulting in a relatively small percentage of the crime in absolute numbers  none the less have brought public focus on that type of weapon  69  Kruschke states  however  regarding the fully automatic firearms owned by private citizens in the United States  that  approximately 175 000 automatic firearms have been licensed by the Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco  and Firearms  the federal agency responsible for administration of the law  and evidence suggests that none of these weapons has ever been used to commit a violent crime   70  Likewise  Kruschke states that automatic weapons are different than common semi automatic hunting weapons  as the  most common examples  of automatic weapons  are machine guns  submachine guns  and certain types of military and police rifles   71  This recognizes that there are semi automatic household guns that are in widespread use like the  22 caliber Marlin Model 60 hunting rifle  Similarly  although Kruschke claims long guns are not being used in suicide  there are in fact instances of long guns that are used for suicides  72  Pro gun groups claim that confusing voters about different types of guns continues to be a strategy of gun control groups  who in turn claim that certain types of firearms are either particularly unsafe  particularly likely to be used in crime  or particularly unsuited for  sporting purposes   and therefore should be banned  The types of guns so designated has included  any small  inexpensive handgun

handguns  76  semi automatic  assault weapons   using either the 1994 definition 77  or a more expansive definition 78    and  50 caliber rifles  79  The current bid to ban  50 caliber rifles nationally shows the typical issues that arise in campaigns to ban certain firearm types  Pro ban groups have preferred the phrase  Sniper Rifle Ban  to promote the law  even though the  50 caliber rifles are typically considered  counter sniper  and  anti mat riel  weapons  In fact  the term  sniper rifle  implies a much broader range of rifles  80  the US M24 and M40 military sniper rifles are bolt action  7 62 mm caliber weapons with telescopic sights  both models being variants of the civilian Remington Model 700   the  D C  Snipers  used a  223 semi automatic rifle  and Charles Whitman  the 1966  Texas Tower Sniper   used a common scoped hunting rifle  as did many of the private citizens who returned fire that day   Pro gun groups see the attempts to ban  50 cal rifles as the first step toward banning an ever expanding  sniper gun  or  high powered rifle  category  81  In promoting a California  50 caliber ban  the LAPD received criticism for deceiving the public when a police owned Barrett M82 was produced for a press conference supporting the ban  while never mentioning that the rifle was already banned by existing state law  82   edit  Political arguments Main article  Political arguments of gun politics in the United States Political arguments of gun politics in the United States center around disagreements that range from the practical   does gun ownership cause or prevent crime    to the constitutional   how should the Second Amendment be interpreted    to the ethical   what should the balance be between an individual s right of self defense through gun ownership and the People s interest in maintaining public safety  Political arguments about gun rights fall into two basic categories  first  does the government have the authority to regulate guns  and second  if it does  is it effective public policy to regulate guns  51  The first category  collectively known as rights based arguments  consist of Second Amendment arguments  state constitution arguments  right of self defense arguments  and security against tyranny and invasion arguments  Public policy arguments  the second category of arguments  revolve around the importance of a militia  the reduction of gun violence and firearm deaths  and also can include arguments regarding security against foreign invasions   edit  Courts and the law  edit  Supreme Court decisions Since the late 19th century  with three key cases from the pre incorporation era  the Supreme Court consistently ruled that the Second Amendment  and the Bill of Rights  restricts only the federal Congress  and not the States  in the regulation of guns  83  Scholars predicted that the Court s incorporation of other rights suggests that they may incorporate the Second  should a suitable case come before them  84   Americans also have a right to defend their homes  and we need not challenge that  Nor does anyone seriously question that the Constitution protects the right of hunters to own and keep sporting guns for hunting game any more than anyone would challenge the right to own and keep fishing rods and other equipment for fishing   or to own automobiles  To  keep and bear arms  for hunting today is essentially a recreational activity and not an imperative of survival  as it was 200 years ago   Saturday night specials  and machine guns are not recreational weapons and surely are as much in need of regulation as motor vehicles     Ex Chief Justice Warren Burger  1990  85  Until recently  there had been only one modern Supreme Court case that dealt directly with the Second Amendment  United States v  Miller  86  In that case  the Supreme Court did not address the incorporation issue  but the case instead hinged on whether a sawed off shotgun  has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia   84  In quashing the indictment against Miller  the U S  District Court for the Western District of Arkansas stated that the National Firearms Act of 1934   offend ed  the inhibition of the Second Amendment to the Constitution   The federal government then appealed directly to the US Supreme Court  On appeal the federal government did not object to Miller s release since he had died by then  seeking only to have the trial judge s ruling on the unconstitutionality of the federal law overturned  Under these circumstances  neither Miller nor his attorney appeared before the US Supreme Court to argue the case  The Court only heard argument from the federal prosecutor  In its ruling  the Supreme Court overturned the trial court and upheld the law  For a more complete reading of this case  see Reynolds  Glenn Harlan and Denning  Brannon P    Telling Miller s Tale    65 Law  amp  Contemp  Probs  113  Spring 2002   87   edit  District of Columbia v  Heller See also  District of Columbia v  Heller and Firearm case law in the United States On June 26  2008  in District of Columbia v  Heller  88  the United States Supreme Court affirmed  by a 5 4 vote  the decision of the D C  Circuit Court of Appeals  89  This decision struck down the D C  gun law  It also clarifies the scope of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution  stating that it stipulates an individual right irrespective of membership in a militia  However  the court made it clear that like other rights  the right to bear arms is not without limitations  leaving open the prospect of governmental regulation  The decision declined to rule on the incorporation of the Second Amendment  leaving its applicability to the states unsettled   While the status of the Second Amendment within the twentieth century incorporation debate is a matter of importance for the many challenges to state gun control laws  it is an issue that we need not decide   90     edit  McDonald v  Chicago Further information  McDonald v  Chicago June 28  2010  Chicago gun control law struck down 5 to 4   The Fourteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment

Gun laws in the United States  by state  and Gun law in the United States Gun control laws and regulations exist at all levels of government  with the vast majority being local codes which vary between jurisdictions  The NRA reports 20 000 gun laws nationwide  91  A study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine notes 300 federal and state laws regarding the manufacture  design  sale  purchase  or possession of guns  92  At the federal level  fully automatic weapons and short barrel shotguns have been taxed and mandated to be registered since 1934 with the National Firearms Act  The Gun Control Act of 1968 adds prohibition of mail order sales and prohibits transfers to minors  The 1968 Act requires that guns carry serial numbers and implemented a tracking system to determine the purchaser of a gun whose make  model  and serial number are known  It also prohibited gun ownership by convicted felons and certain other individuals  The Act was updated in the 1990s with the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act  mainly to add a mechanism for the criminal history of gun purchasers to be checked at the point of sale  and in 1996 with the Domestic Violence Offender Gun Ban to prohibit ownership and use of guns by individuals convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence  The 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act enacted the now defunct Federal Assault Weapons Ban  which banned the purchase  sale  or transfer of any weapon specifically named in the act  other weapons with a certain number of  defining features   and detachable magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition  that had been manufactured after the beginning date of the ban  The Assault Weapons Ban expired in 2004  but H R  6257 introduced June 12  2008 sought to re instate the ban indefinitely as well as to expand the list of banned weapons  The bill ultimately died in committee  New York  California  Massachusetts  Hawaii  Connecticut  and New Jersey and several municipalities have codified some provisions of the expired Federal ban into State and local laws  Gun Free School Zones Act of 1995 The Federal Gun Free School Zone Act of 1995 93  severely limited where a person may legally carry a firearm  although this was voided by United States v  Lopez as an abuse of the Commerce Clause  It did this by making it generally unlawful for an armed citizen to travel on any public sidewalk  road  or highway  that passes within one thousand  1000  feet of the property line of any K 12 school in the nation  This seems to severely restrict the ability of persons to carry firearms  especially in densely populated areas with many schools  Only if one has a state permit to carry a firearm are they exempt from the one thousand foot rule  however they are still prohibited from carrying on school grounds    B  Subparagraph  A  does not apply to the possession of a firearm      ii  if the individual possessing the firearm is licensed to do so by the State in which the school zone is located   edit  See also Carrying concealed weapon Civilian Marksmanship Program Coalition to Stop Gun Violence Firearm case law in the United States Gun
