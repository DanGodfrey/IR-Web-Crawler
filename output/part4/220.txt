variety of climates  Straddling two major zones  the majority of the state  with the exception of the southeastern corner  has a humid continental climate  Greater Philadelphia has some characteristics of the humid subtropical climate that covers much of Delaware and Maryland to the south  Moving toward the mountainous interior of the state  the climate becomes markedly colder  the number of cloudy days increases  and winter snowfall amounts are greater  Western areas of the state  particularly cities near Lake Erie  can receive over 100 inches  254 cm  of snowfall annually  and the entire state receives plentiful precipitation throughout the year  The state may be subject to severe weather from spring through summer into fall  as an average of 10 tornadoes touch down each year in the state  Monthly Normal High and Low Temperatures For Various Pennsylvania Cities in Fahrenheit City Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Scranton 34 19 37 21 47 28 59 39 70 48 78

the Commonwealth was settled by Europeans  the area was home to the Delaware  also known as Lenni Lenape   Susquehannock  Iroquois  Eriez  Shawnee  and other American Indian Nations  10  Both the Dutch and the English claimed both sides of the Delaware River as part of their colonial lands in America  11  12  13  The Dutch were the first to take possession  which has impact on the history of Pennsylvania  14  By June 3  1631  the Dutch had started up the DelMarVa Peninsula by establishing the Zwaanendael Colony on the site of present day Lewes  Delaware  15  In 1638  Sweden heated up the issue by establishing the New Sweden Colony  centered on Fort Christina  on the site of present day Wilmington  Delaware  New Sweden claimed and  for the most part  controlled the lower Delaware River region  Parts of present Delaware  New Jersey and Pennsylvania  but settled few colonists there  16  17  Penn s Treaty with the Indians  by Edward Hicks  On March 12  1664  King Charles II of England gave James  Duke of York a grant that included all of the lands included in the original Virginia Company of Plymouth Grant as well as other lands  This grant was   again   in conflict with the Dutch claim for New Netherland  which included parts of today s Pennsylvania  18  On June 24  1664  The Duke of York sold the portion of his large grant that included present day New Jersey to John Berkeley and George Carteret for a proprietary colony  As of yet  the land was not in British possession  but the sale boxed in the portion of New Netherland on the West side of the Delaware River  The British conquest of New Netherland was commenced on August 29  1664  when New Amsterdam was coerced to surrender  facing the cannons on British ships in New York Harbor  19  20  This conquest continued  and was completed in October 1664  when the British captured Fort Casimir in what today is New Castle  Delaware  John Dickinson The Peace of Breda between England  France and the Netherlands confirmed the British conquest on July 21  1667  21  22  although there were temporary reversions  On September 12  1672  as part of the Third Anglo Dutch War  the Dutch re conquered New York Colony New Amsterdam  the Dutch established three County Courts which went on to become original Counties in present day Delaware and Pennsylvania  The one that later transferred to Pennsylvania was Upland  23  This was partially reversed on February 9  1674  when the Treaty of Westminster ended the Third Anglo Dutch War  and reverted all political situations to the status quo ante bellum  The British retained the Dutch Counties with their Dutch names  24  By June 11  1674  New York reasserted control over the outlying colonies  including Upland  but the names started to be changed to British names by November 11  1674  25  Upland was partitioned on November 12  1674  producing the general outline of the current border between Pennsylvania and Delaware  26  On February 28  1681  Charles II granted a land charter 27  to William Penn to repay a debt of  16 000 28   around  2 100 000 in 2008  adjusting for retail inflation  29  owed to William s father  Admiral William Penn  This was one of the largest land grants to an individual in history  30  It was called Pennsylvania  William Penn  who wanted it called New Wales or Sylvania  was embarrassed at the change  fearing that people would think he had named it after himself  but King Charles would not rename the grant  31  Penn established a government with two innovations that were much copied in the New World  the county commission and freedom of religious conviction  30  What had been Upland on what became the Pennsylvania side of the Pennsylvania Delaware Border was renamed as Chester County when Pennsylvania instituted their colonial governments on March 4  1681  32  33  The Quaker leader William Penn had signed a peace treaty with Tammany  leader of the Delaware tribe  beginning a long period of friendly relations between the Quakers and the Indians  34  Additional treaties between Quakers and other tribes followed  The treaty of William Penn was never violated  35  Between 1730 and when it was shut down by Parliament with the Currency Act of 1764  the Pennsylvania Colony made its own paper money to account for the shortage of actual gold and silver  The paper money was called Colonial Scrip  The Colony issued  bills of credit   which were as good as gold or silver coins because of their legal tender status  Since they were issued by the government and not a banking institution  it was an interest free proposition  largely defraying the expense of the government and therefore taxation of the people  It also promoted general employment and prosperity  since the Government used discretion and did not issue too much to inflate the currency  Benjamin Franklin had a hand in creating this currency  of which he said its utility was never to be disputed  and it also met with the  cautious approval  of Adam Smith  36  President s House  Philadelphia  The Masters Penn mansion housed Pennsylvania s governor in the early 1770s  It later served as the presidential mansion of George Washington and John Adams  1790 1800  while Philadelphia was the temporary national capital  After the Stamp Act Congress of 1765  Delegate John Dickinson of Philadelphia  Pennsylvania  wrote the Declaration of Rights and Grievances  The Congress was the first meeting of the thirteen colonies  called at the request of the Massachusetts Assembly  but only nine colonies sent delegates  37  Dickinson then wrote Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania  To the Inhabitants of the British Colonies  which were published in the Pennsylvania Chronicle between December 2  1767  and February 15  1768  38  When the Founding Fathers of the United States convened in Philadelphia in 1774  12 colonies sent representatives to the First Continental Congress  39  The Second Continental Congress  which also met in Philadelphia  in May  1775   drew up and signed the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia  40  but when that city was captured by the British  the Continental Congress escaped westward  meeting at the Lancaster courthouse on Saturday  September 27  1777  and then to York  There they drew up the Articles of Confederation that formed 13 independent colonies into a new nation  Later  the Constitution was written  and Philadelphia was once again chosen to be cradle to the new American Nation  41  Pennsylvania became the second state to ratify the U S  Constitution on December 12  1787  42  five days after Delaware became the first  Dickinson College of Carlisle was the first college founded in the United States  Established in 1773  the college was ratified five days after the Treaty of Paris on September 9  1783  The school was founded by Benjamin Rush and named after John Dickinson  The  Hills Capitol   used from 1821 until it burned down in 1897 For half a century  the Commonwealth s General Assembly  legislature  met at various places in the general Philadelphia area before starting to meet regularly in Independence Hall in Philadelphia for 63 years  43  But it needed a more central location  as for example the Paxton Boys massacres of 1763 had made the legislature aware  So  in 1799 the General Assembly moved to the Lancaster Courthouse  43  and finally in 1812 to Harrisburg  43  The General Assembly met in the old Dauphin County Court House until December 1821  43  when the Federal style  Hills Capitol   named for its builder  Stephen Hills  a Lancaster architect  was constructed on a hilltop land grant of four acres set aside for a seat of state government by the prescient  entrepreneurial son and namesake of John Harris  Sr   a Yorkshire native who had founded a trading post in 1705 and ferry  1733  on the east shore of the Susquehanna River  44  The Hills Capitol burned down on February 2  1897  during a heavy snowstorm  presumably because of a faulty flue  43  The General Assembly met at Grace Methodist Church on State Street  still standing  until the a new capitol could be built  Following an architectural selection contest that many alleged had been  rigged   Chicago architect Henry Ives Cobb was charged with designing and building a replacement building  however  the legislature had little money to allocate to the project  and a roughly finished  somewhat industrial building  the Cobb Capitol  was completed  The General Assembly refused to occupy the building  Political and popular indignation in 1901 prompted a second contest that was restricted to Pennsylvania architects  and Joseph Miller Huston of Philadelphia was chosen to design the present Pennsylvania State Capitol that incorporated Cobb s building into magnificent public work finished and dedicated in 1907  43  Roosevelt s FERA camp for unemployed women  1934 The new state Capitol drew rave reviews  43  Its dome was inspired by the domes of St  Peter s Basilica in Rome and the United States Capitol  43 President Theodore Roosevelt called it  the most beautiful state Capitol in the nation  and said   It s the handsomest building I ever saw  at the dedication  In 1989  the New York Times praised it as  grand  even awesome at moments  but it is also a working building  accessible to citizens     a building that connects with the reality of daily life   43  Pennsylvania accounts for nine percent of wooded areas in the United States  In 1923 President Calvin Coolidge established the Allegheny National Forest under the authority of the Weeks Act of 1911 in the northwest part of the state in Elk  Forest  McKean  and Warren Counties for the purposes of timber production and watershed protection in the Allegheny River basin  The Allegheny is the state s only national forest  James Buchanan  of Franklin County  the only bachelor President of the United States  45  was the only one to be born in Pennsylvania  The Battle of Gettysburg the major turning point of the Civil War took place near Gettysburg  46  An estimated 350 000 Pennsylvanians served in the Union Army forces along with 8 600 African American military volunteers  Pennsylvania was also the home of the first commercially drilled oil well  In 1859  near Titusville  Pennsylvania  Edwin L  Drake successfully drilled the well  which led to the first major oil boom in United States history

Hispanic or Latino ancestry  47  Pennsylvania s Hispanic population grew by 82 6  between 2000 and 2010  making it one of the largest increases in a state s Hispanic population  The significant growth of the Hispanic population is due to immigration to the state mainly from Puerto Rico  which is a US territory  but to a lesser extant from countries such as the Dominican Republic  Mexico  and various Central and South American nations  as well as from the wave of Hispanics fleeing New York and New Jersey for safer and more affordable living  The Asian population swelled by almost 60   which was fueled by Indian  Vietnamese  and Chinese immigration  as well the many Asian transplants moving to Philadelphia from New York  The rapid growth of this community has given Pennsylvania one of the largest Asian populations in the nation by numerical values  The Black and African American population grow by 13   which was the largest increase in that population amongst the state s peers  New York  New Jersey  Ohio  Illinois  and Michigan  The White population declined by 0 7   a trend that is beginning to reverse itself  Twelve other states saw decreases in their White populations  48  The center of population of Pennsylvania is located in Perry County  in the borough of Duncannon  49  State population from 1790 to 2000 Pennsylvania s population distribution  As of 2006  Pennsylvania has an estimated population of 12 440 621  which is an increase of 35 273 from the previous year and an increase of 159 567 since the year 2000  Net migration from other states resulted in a decrease of 27 718  and immigration from other countries resulted in an increase of 127 007  Net migration to the Commonwealth was 98 289  Migration of native Pennsylvanians resulted in a decrease of 100 000 people  In 2006  5 00  of Pennsylvanians were foreign born  621 480 people   50  The state has an estimated 2005 poverty rate of 11 9   51  The state also has the 3rd highest proportion of elderly  65   citizens in 2005  51  Foreign born Pennsylvanians are largely from Asia  36 0    Europe  35 9    Latin America  30 6    Africa  5    North America  3 1    and Oceania  0 4    Pennsylvania s reported population of Hispanics  especially among the Asian  Hawaiian and White races  has markedly increased in recent years  52  The Hispanic population is greatest in Allentown  Lancaster  Reading  Hazleton  and around Philadelphia  with over 20  being Hispanic  It is not clear how much of this change reflects a changing population and how much reflects increased willingness to self identify minority status  As of 2010  it is estimated that about 85  of all Hispanics in Pennsylvania live within a 150 miles  240 km  radius of Philadelphia  and about 20  within the city itself  Pennsylvania s population was reported as 5 9  under 5 and 23 8  under 18  with 15 6  aged 65 or older  Females made up 51 7  of the population  53  The largest ancestry groups are listed

original Thirteen Colonies forming the United States  and also in part because of the number of important American documents signed in the state  such as the Declaration of Independence   It was also a keystone state economically  having both the industry common to the North  making such wares as Conestoga wagons and rifles  124  125  and the agriculture common to the South  producing feed  fiber  food  and tobacco   126  Another one of Pennsylvania s nicknames is the Quaker State  in colonial times  it was known officially as the Quaker Province  127  in recognition of Quaker 128 William Penn s First Frame of Government 129 constitution for Pennsylvania that guaranteed liberty of conscience  He knew of the hostility 130  Quakers faced when they opposed religious ritual  taking oaths  violence  war and military service  and what they viewed as ostentatious frippery  131   The Coal State    The Oil State    The Chocolate State   and  The Steel State  were adopted when those were the state s greatest industries  132   The State of Independence  currently appears on many road signs entering the state   edit  Notable people Main article  List of people from Pennsylvania  edit
