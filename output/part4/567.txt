federal criminal investigative body and an internal intelligence agency  counterintelligence   Also  it is the government agency responsible for investigating crimes on Indian Reservations in the United States 2  under the Major Crimes Act  The branch has investigative jurisdiction over violations of more than 200 categories of federal crime  3  The agency was established in 1908 as the Bureau of Investigation  BOI   Its name was changed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI  in 1935  The agency headquarters is the J  Edgar Hoover Building  located in Washington  D C   The agency has fifty six field offices located in major cities throughout the United States  and more than 400 resident agencies in lesser cities and areas across the nation  More than 50 international offices

References 13 Further reading 14 External links Budget  mission and priorities In the fiscal year 2011  the agency s total budget was approximately  7 9 billion  4  The FBI s main goal is to protect and defend the United States  to uphold and enforce the criminal laws of the United States  and to provide leadership and criminal justice services to federal  state  municipal  and international agencies and partners  3  Currently  the FBI s top investigative priorities are  5  Protect the United States from terrorist attacks  see counter terrorism   Protect the United States against foreign intelligence operations and espionage  see counter intelligence   Protect the United States against cyber based attacks and high technology crimes  see cyber warfare   Combat public corruption at all levels  Protect civil rights  Combat transnational national criminal organizations and enterprises  see organized crime   Combat major white collar crime  Combat significant violent crime  In August 2007  the top categories of lead criminal charges resulting from FBI investigations were  6  Bank robbery and incidental crimes  107 charges  Drugs  104 charges  Attempt and conspiracy  81 charges  Material involving sexual exploitation of minors  53 charges  Mail fraud   frauds and swindles  51 charges  Bank fraud  31 charges  Prohibition of illegal gambling businesses  22 charges  Fraud by wire  radio  or television  20 charges  Hobbs Act  Robbery and extortion affecting interstate commerce   17 charges  Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act  RICO  prohibited activities  17 charges  Indian reservations The federal government has the primary responsibility for investigating 7  and prosecuting serious crime on Indian reservations  8  The FBI has criminal jurisdiction in  Indian Country   the official name for the program  for major crimes under the  Indian Country  Crimes Act  Title 18  United States Code  Section 1152   the Indian Country Major Crimes Act  Title 18  United States Code  Section 1153   and the Assimilative Crimes Act  Title 18  United States Code  Section 13   The 1994 Crime Act expanded federal criminal jurisdiction in Indian Country in such areas as guns  violent juveniles  drugs  and domestic violence  Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act  the FBI has jurisdiction over any criminal act directly related to casino gaming  The FBI also investigates civil rights violations  environmental crimes  public corruption  and government fraud occurring in  Indian Country     9  The FBI does not specifically list crimes in Native American land as one of its priorities  10  Often serious crimes have been either poorly investigated or prosecution has been declined  Tribal courts can only impose sentences of up to three years  and then under certain restrictions  11  12  Indian reservations often use the police of the Bureau of Indian Affairs  which is an agency of the U S  Department of the Interior  for investigation within the reservation  Tribal police have limited jurisdiction over crimes  Legal authority FBI badge and service pistol  a Glock Model 22   40 S amp W caliber The FBI s mandate is established in Title 28 of the United States Code  U S  Code   Section 533  which authorizes the Attorney General to  appoint officials to detect    crimes against the United States   13  Other federal statutes give the FBI the authority and responsibility to investigate specific crimes  The FBI s chief tool against organized crime is the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations  RICO  Act  The FBI is also charged with the responsibility of enforcing compliance of the United States Civil Rights Act of 1964 and investigating violations of the act in addition to prosecuting such violations with the United States Department of Justice  DOJ   The FBI also shares concurrent jurisdiction with the Drug Enforcement Administration  DEA  in the enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970  The USA PATRIOT Act increased the powers allotted to the FBI  especially in wiretapping and monitoring of Internet activity  One of the most controversial provisions of the act is the so called sneak and peek provision  granting the FBI powers to search a house while the residents are away  and not requiring them to notify the residents for several weeks afterwards  Under the PATRIOT Act s provisions  the FBI also resumed inquiring into the library records 14  of those who are suspected of terrorism  something it had supposedly not done since the 1970s   In the early 1980s  Senate hearings were held to examine FBI undercover operations in the wake of the Abscam controversy  which had allegations of entrapment of elected officials  As a result  in following years a number of guidelines were issued to constrain FBI activities  A March 2007 report by the inspector general of the Justice Department described the FBI s  widespread and serious misuse  of national security letters  a form of administrative subpoena used to demand records and data pertaining to individuals  The report said that between 2003 and 2005  the FBI had issued more than 140 000 national security letters  many involving people with no obvious connections to terrorism  15  Information obtained through an FBI investigation is presented to the appropriate U S  Attorney or Department of Justice official  who decides if prosecution or other action is warranted  The FBI often works in conjunction with other Federal agencies  including the U S  Coast Guard  USCG  and U S  Customs and Border Protection  CBP  in seaport and airport security  16  and the National Transportation Safety Board in investigating airplane crashes and other critical incidents  Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations  ICE HSI  has nearly the same amount of investigative man power as the FBI  and investigates the largest range of crimes  In the wake of the September 11 attacks  AG Ashcroft assigned the FBI as the designated lead organization in terrorism investigations after the creation of the U S  Department of Homeland Security  ICE HSI and the FBI are both integral members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force  History In 1886  the Supreme Court  in Wabash  St  Louis  amp  Pacific Railway Company v  Illinois  found that the states had no power to regulate interstate commerce  The resulting Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 created a Federal responsibility for interstate law enforcement  The Justice Department made little effort to relieve its staff shortage until the turn of the century  when Attorney General Charles Joseph Bonaparte reached out to other agencies  including the Secret Service  for investigators  But the Congress forbade this use of Treasury employees by Justice  passing a law to that effect in 1908  So the Attorney General moved to organize a formal Bureau of Investigation  BOI or BI   complete with its own staff of special agents  The Secret Service provided the Department of Justice 12 Special Agents and these agents became the first Agents in the new BOI  Thus  the first FBI agents were actually Secret Service agents  Its jurisdiction derived from the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887  17  18  The FBI grew out of this force of special agents created on July 26  1908 during the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt  The first Chief  the title has since been changed to Director  was Stanley W  Finch  Its first official task was visiting and making surveys of the houses of prostitution in preparation for enforcing the  White Slave Traffic Act   or Mann Act  passed on June 25  1910  In 1932  it was renamed the United States Bureau of Investigation  The following year it was linked to the Bureau of Prohibition and rechristened the Division of Investigation  DOI  before finally becoming an independent service within the Department of Justice in 1935  17  In the same year  its name was officially changed from the Division of Investigation to the present day Federal Bureau of Investigation  or FBI  J  Edgar Hoover as director J  Edgar Hoover  FBI Director from 1924 to 1972  The Director of the BOI  J  Edgar Hoover  was an FBI Director who served from 1924 1972  a combined 48 years with the BOI  DOI  and FBI  He was chiefly responsible for creating the Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory  or the FBI Laboratory  which officially opened in 1932  as part of his work to professionalize investigations by the government  Hoover had substantial involvement in most major cases and projects which the FBI handled during his tenure  After Hoover s death  Congress passed legislation limiting the tenure of future FBI Directors to a maximum of ten years  During the  War on Crime  of the 1930s  FBI agents apprehended or killed a number of notorious criminals who carried out kidnappings  robberies  and murders throughout the nation  including John Dillinger   Baby Face  Nelson  Kate  Ma  Barker  Alvin  Creepy  Karpis  and George  Machine Gun  Kelly  Other activities of its early decades included a decisive role in reducing the scope and influence of the Ku Klux Klan  Additionally  through the work of Edwin Atherton  the FBI claimed success in apprehending an entire army of Mexican neo revolutionaries along the California border in the 1920s  Hoover began using wiretapping in the 1920s during Prohibition to arrest bootleggers  19  A 1927 case in which a bootlegger was caught through telephone tapping went to the United States Supreme Court  which ruled that the FBI could use wiretaps in its investigations and did not violate the Fourth Amendment as unlawful search and seizure as long as the FBI did not break in to a person s home to complete the tapping  19  After Prohibition s repeal  Congress passed the Communications Act of 1934  which outlawed non consensual phone tapping  but allowed bugging  19  In another Supreme Court case  the court ruled in 1939 that due to the 1934 law  evidence the FBI obtained by phone tapping was inadmissible in court  19  A 1967 Supreme Court decision overturned the 1927 case allowing bugging  after which Congress passed the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act  allowing public authorities to tap telephones during investigations  as long as they obtain a warrant beforehand  19  National security Beginning in the 1940s and continuing into the 1970s  the Bureau investigated cases of espionage against the United States and its allies  Eight Nazi agents who had planned sabotage operations against American targets were arrested  and six were executed  Ex parte Quirin  under their sentences  Also during this time  a joint US UK code breaking effort  Venona  with which the FBI was heavily involved broke Soviet diplomatic and intelligence communications codes  allowing the US and British governments to read Soviet communications  This effort confirmed the existence of Americans working in the United States for Soviet intelligence  20  Hoover was administering this project but failed to notify the Central Intelligence Agency  CIA  until 1952  Another notable case is the arrest of Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in 1957  21  The discovery of Soviet spies operating in the US allowed Hoover to pursue his longstanding obsession with the threat he perceived from the American Left  ranging from Communist Party of the United States of America  CPUSA  union organizers to American liberals  Civil rights movement During the 1950s and 1960s  FBI officials became increasingly concerned about the influence of civil rights leaders  whom they believed had communist ties or were unduly influenced by them  In 1956  for example  Hoover sent an open letter denouncing Dr  T R M  Howard  a civil rights leader  surgeon  and wealthy entrepreneur in Mississippi who had criticized FBI inaction in solving recent murders of George W  Lee  Emmett Till  and other blacks in the South  22  The FBI carried out controversial domestic surveillance in an operation it called the COINTELPRO  which was short for  COunter INTELligence PROgram   23  It was to investigate and disrupt the activities of dissident political organizations within the United States  including both militant and non violent organizations  Among its targets was the Southern Christian Leadership Conference  a leading civil rights organization with clergy leadership  24  The FBI frequently investigated Martin Luther King  Jr  In his 1991 memoir  Washington Post journalist Carl Rowan asserted that the FBI had sent at least one anonymous letter to King encouraging him to commit suicide  25  In March 1971  the residential office of an FBI agent in Media  Pennsylvania was robbed  the thieves took secret files and distributed them to a range of newspapers  including The Harvard Crimson  26  The files detailed the FBI s extensive COINTELPRO program  which included investigations into lives of ordinary citizens including a black student group at a Pennsylvania military college and the daughter of Congressman Henry Reuss of Wisconsin  26  The country was  jolted  by the revelations  and the actions were denounced by members of Congress  including House Majority Leader Hale Boggs  26  The phones of some members of Congress  including Boggs  had allegedly been tapped  26  Kennedy s assassination When President John F  Kennedy was shot and killed  the jurisdiction fell to the local police departments until President Lyndon B  Johnson directed the FBI to take over the investigation  27  To ensure clarity about responsibility for investigation of homicides of federal officials  Congress passed a law that put investigations of deaths of federal officials within FBI jurisdiction  Organized crime In response to organized crime  on August 25  1953  the FBI created the Top Hoodlum Program  The national office directed field offices to gather information on mobsters in their territories and to report it regularly to Washington for a centralized collection of intelligence on racketeers  28  After the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act  or RICO Act  took effect  the FBI began investigating the former Prohibition organized groups  which had become fronts for crime in major cities and small towns  All of the FBI work was done undercover and from within these organizations  using the provisions provided in the RICO Act  Gradually the agency dismantled many of the groups  Although Hoover initially denied the existence of a National Crime Syndicate in the United States  the Bureau later conducted operations against known organized crime syndicates and families  including those headed by Sam Giancana and John Gotti  The RICO Act is still used today for all organized crime and any individuals who might fall under the Act  In 2003 a congressional committee called the FBI s organized crime informant program  one of the greatest failures in the history of federal law enforcement   29  While protecting an informant in March 1965  the FBI allowed four innocent men to be convicted of murder  Three of the men were sentenced to death  which was later reduced to life in prison   The fourth defendant was sentenced to life in prison  where he spent three decades  29  In July 2007  U S  District Judge Nancy Gertner in Boston found the bureau helped convict the four men of the March 1965 gangland murder of Edward  Teddy  Deegan  The U S  Government was ordered to pay  100 million in damages to the four defendants  30  Notable post Hoover reorganizations Special FBI teams In 1984  the FBI formed an elite unit 31  to help with problems that might arise at the 1984 Summer Olympics to be held in Los Angeles  particularly terrorism and major crime  This was a result of the 1972 Summer Olympics at Munich  Germany  when terrorists murdered the Israeli athletes  Named Hostage Rescue Team  HRT   it acts as the FBI lead for a national SWAT team in related procedures and all counter terrorism cases  Also formed in 1984 was the Computer Analysis and Response Team  CART   32  From the end of the 1980s to the early 1990s  the FBI reassigned more than 300 agents from foreign counter intelligence duties to violent crime  and made violent crime the sixth national priority  With reduced cuts to other well established departments  and because terrorism was no longer considered a threat after the end of the Cold War  32  the FBI assisted local police forces in tracking fugitives who had crossed state lines  a felony  The FBI Laboratory helped develop DNA testing  continuing its pioneering role in identification that began with its fingerprinting system in 1924  Notable efforts in the 1990s An FBI Agent tags the cockpit voice recorder from EgyptAir Flight 990 on the deck of the USS Grapple  ARS 53  at the crash site on November 13  1999  Between 1993 and 1996  the FBI increased its counter terrorism role in the wake of the first 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York  New York  the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995  and the arrest of the Unabomber in 1996  Technological innovation and the skills of FBI Laboratory analysts helped ensure that the three cases were successfully prosecuted  33  In the early and late 1990s  the FBI role in the Ruby Ridge and Waco incidents caused a public uproar in the government s role in the killings  During the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta  Georgia  the FBI was criticized for its investigation on the Centennial Olympic Park bombing  It has settled a dispute with Richard Jewell  who was a private security guard at the venue  along with some media organizations  34  in regard to the leaking of his name during the investigation  After Congress passed the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act  CALEA  1994   the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  HIPAA  1996   and the Economic Espionage Act  EEA  1996   the FBI followed suit and underwent a technological upgrade in 1998  just as it did with its CART team in 1991  Computer Investigations and Infrastructure Threat Assessment Center  CITAC  and the National Infrastructure Protection Center  NIPC  were created to deal with the increase in Internet related problems  such as computer viruses  worms  and other malicious programs that threatened US operations  With these developments  the FBI increased its electronic surveillance in public safety and national security investigations  adapting to the telecommunications advancements that changed the nature of such problems  September 11th attacks Within months of the September 11 attacks in 2001  FBI Director Robert Mueller  who had been sworn in a week before the attacks  called for a re engineering of FBI structure and operations  He made countering every federal crime a top priority  including the prevention of terrorism  countering foreign intelligence operations  addressing cyber security threats  other high tech crimes  protecting civil rights  combating public corruption  organized crime  white collar crime  and major acts of violent crime  35  In February 2001  Robert Hanssen was caught selling information to the Russian government  It was later learned that Hanssen  who had reached a high position within the FBI  had been selling intelligence since as early as 1979  He pleaded guilty to treason and received a life sentence in 2002  but the incident led many to question the security practices employed by the FBI  There was also a claim that Robert Hanssen might have contributed information that led to the September 11  2001 attacks  36  The 9 11 Commission s final report on July 22  2004 stated that the FBI and Central Intelligence Agency  CIA  were both partially to blame for not pursuing intelligence reports which could have prevented the September 11  2001 attacks  In its most damning assessment  the report concluded that the country had  not been well served  by either agency and listed numerous recommendations for changes within the FBI  37  While the FBI has acceded to most of the recommendations  including oversight by the new Director of National Intelligence  some former members of the 9 11 Commission publicly criticized the FBI in October 2005  claiming it was resisting any meaningful changes  38  On July 8  2007 the Washington Post published excerpts from UCLA Professor Amy Zegart s book Spying Blind  The CIA  the FBI  and the Origins of 9 11  39  The Post reported from Zegart s book that government documents show the CIA and FBI missed 23 potential chances to disrupt the terrorist attacks of September 11  2001  The primary reasons for the failures included  agency cultures resistant to change and new ideas  inappropriate incentives for promotion  and a lack of cooperation between the FBI  CIA and the rest of the United States Intelligence Community  The book blamed the FBI s decentralized structure  which prevented effective communication and cooperation among different FBI offices  The book suggested that the FBI has not evolved into an effective counter terrorism or counter intelligence agency  due in large part to deeply ingrained agency cultural resistance to change  For example  FBI personnel practices continue to treat all staff other than Special Agents as support staff  classifying intelligence analysts alongside the FBI s auto mechanics and janitors  40  Organization and rank structure Organization chart for the FBI as of January 20  2010 The FBI is organized into five functional branches and the Office of the Director  which contains most administrative offices  Each branch is managed by an Executive Assistant

Director Director Infrastructure J  Edgar Hoover Building  FBI Headquarters FBI Mobile Command Center  Washington Field Office The FBI is headquartered at the J  Edgar Hoover Building in Washington  D C   with 56 field offices 42  in major cities across the United States  The FBI also maintains over 400 resident agencies across the United States  as well as over 50 legal attach s at United States embassies and consulates  Many specialized FBI functions are located at facilities in Quantico  Virginia  as well as a  data campus  in Clarksburg  West Virginia  where 96 million sets of fingerprints  from across the United States are stored  along with others collected by American authorities from prisoners in Saudi Arabia and Yemen  Iraq and Afghanistan   43  The FBI is in process of moving its Records Management Division  which processes Freedom of Information Act  FOIA  requests  to Winchester  Virginia  44  According to the Washington Post  the FBI  is building a vast repository controlled by people who work in a top secret vault on the fourth floor of the J  Edgar Hoover FBI Building in Washington  This one stores the profiles of tens of thousands of Americans and legal residents who are not accused of any crime  What they have done is appear to be acting suspiciously to a town sheriff  a traffic cop or even a neighbor   43  The FBI Laboratory  established with the formation of the BOI  45  did not appear in the J  Edgar Hoover Building until its completion in 1974  The lab serves as the primary lab for most DNA  biological  and physical work  Public tours of FBI headquarters ran through the FBI laboratory workspace before the move to the J  Edgar Hoover Building  The services the lab conducts include Chemistry  Combined DNA Index System  CODIS   Computer Analysis and Response  DNA Analysis  Evidence Response  Explosives  Firearms and Tool marks  Forensic Audio  Forensic Video  Image Analysis  Forensic Science Research  Forensic Science Training  Hazardous Materials Response  Investigative and Prospective Graphics  Latent Prints  Materials Analysis  Questioned Documents  Racketeering Records  Special Photographic Analysis  Structural Design  and Trace Evidence  46  The services of the FBI Laboratory are used by many state  local  and international agencies free of charge  The lab also maintains a second lab at the FBI Academy  The FBI Academy  located in Quantico  Virginia  is home to the communications and computer laboratory the FBI utilizes  It is also where new agents are sent for training to become FBI Special Agents  Going through the 21 week course is required for every Special Agent  47  First opened for use in 1972  the facility is located on 385 acres  1 6 km2  of woodland  The Academy trains state and local law enforcement agencies  who are invited to the law enforcement training center  The FBI units that reside at Quantico are the Field and Police Training Unit  Firearms Training Unit  Forensic Science Research and Training Center  Technology Services Unit  TSU   Investigative Training Unit  Law Enforcement Communication Unit  Leadership and Management Science Units  LSMU   Physical Training Unit  New Agents  Training Unit  NATU   Practical Applications Unit  PAU   the Investigative Computer Training Unit and the  College of Analytical Studies   In 2000  the FBI began the Trilogy project to upgrade its outdated information technology  IT  infrastructure  This project  originally scheduled to take three years and cost around  380 million  ended up going far over budget and behind schedule  48  Efforts to deploy modern computers and networking equipment were generally successful  but attempts to develop new investigation software  outsourced to Science Applications International Corporation  SAIC   were not  Virtual Case File  or VCF  as the software was known  was plagued by poorly defined goals  and repeated changes in management  49  In January 2005  more than two years after the software was originally planned for completion  the FBI officially abandoned the project  At least  100 million  and much more by some estimates  was spent on the project  which never became operational  The FBI has been forced to continue using its decade old Automated Case Support system  which is considered woefully inadequate by IT experts  In March 2005  the FBI announced it is beginning a new  more ambitious software project  code named Sentinel  expected for completion by 2009  50  Carnivore was an electronic eavesdropping software system implemented by the FBI during the Clinton administration  it was designed to monitor email and electronic communications  After prolonged negative coverage in the press  the FBI changed the name of its system from  Carnivore  to  DCS1000   DCS is reported to stand for  Digital Collection System   the system has the same functions as before  The Associated Press reported in mid January 2005 that the FBI essentially abandoned the use of Carnivore in 2001  in favor of commercially available software  such as NarusInsight  The Criminal Justice Information Services  CJIS  Division  51  is located in Clarksburg  West Virginia  Organized beginning in 1991  the office opened in 1995 as the youngest agency division  The complex is the length of three football fields  It provides a main repository for information in various data systems  Under the roof of the CJIS are the programs for the National Crime Information Center  NCIC   Uniform Crime Reporting  UCR   Fingerprint Identification  Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System  IAFIS   NCIC 2000  and the National Incident Based Reporting System  NIBRS   Many state and local agencies use these data systems as a source for their own investigations and contribute to the database using secure communications  FBI provides these tools of sophisticated identification and information services to local  state  federal  and international law enforcement agencies  FBI is in charge of National Virtual Translation Center  which provides  timely and accurate translations of foreign intelligence for all elements of the Intelligence Community   Bullet lead analysis was faulty For over 40 years  the FBI crime lab in Quantico believed lead in bullets had unique chemical signatures  It analyzed the bullets with the goal of matching them chemically  not only to a single batch of ammunition coming out of a factory  but to a single box of bullets  The National Academy of Sciences conducted an 18 month independent review of comparative bullet lead analysis  In 2003  its National Research Council published a report whose conclusions called into question 30 years of FBI testimony  It found the analytic model used by the FBI for interpreting results was deeply flawed  and the conclusion  that bullet fragments could be matched to a box of ammunition  was so overstated that it was misleading under the rules of evidence  One year later  the FBI decided to stop doing bullet lead analysis  After a 60 Minutes Washington Post investigation in November 2007  two years later   the bureau agreed to identify  review  and release all of the pertinent cases  and notify prosecutors about cases in which faulty testimony was given  52  Personnel An FBI Evidence Response Team Agents in training on the FBI Academy firing range An FBI analyst As of December 31  2009  the FBI had a total of 33 852 employees  That includes 13 412 special agents and 20 420 support professionals  such as intelligence analysts  language specialists  scientists  information technology specialists  and other professionals  53  The Officer Down Memorial Page provides the biographies of 58 FBI agents killed in the line of duty from 1925 to 2011  54  Hiring

1924  was by far the longest serving FBI Director  serving until his death in 1972  In 1968  Congress passed legislation as part of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act Pub L  90 351  June 19  1968  82 Stat  197 that specified a 10 year limit  a maximum of two 5 year terms  for future FBI Directors  as well as requiring Senate confirmation of appointees  As the incumbent  this legislation did not apply to Hoover  only to his successors  The current FBI Director is Robert Mueller  who was appointed in 2001 by George W  Bush  The FBI director is responsible for the day to day operations at the FBI  Along with his deputies  the director makes sure cases and operations are handled correctly  The director also is in charge of making sure the leadership in any one of the FBI field offices are manned with qualified agents  Before the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act was passed in the wake of the September 11 attacks  the FBI director would directly brief the President of the United States on any issues that arise from within the FBI  Since then  the director now reports to the Director of National Intelligence  DNI   who in turn reports to the President  Weapons An FBI Special Agent is issued a Glock Model 22 pistol or a Glock 23 in  40 S amp W caliber  If they fail their first qualification  they will be issued either a Glock 17 or Glock 19 to aid in their next qualification  New agents are issued their firearm with which they qualify  upon successful completion of their training at the FBI Academy  The Glock 26 in 9mm Luger  and Glock Models 23  and 27 in  40 S amp W caliber are authorized as secondary weapons  Special Agents are authorized to purchase and qualify with the Glock Model 21 in  45 ACP for duty carry  Special Agents of the FBI HRT  Hostage Rescue Team   and regional SWAT teams are issued the Springfield Operator or Professional Model 1911A1  45 ACP Pistol   See article FBI Special Weapons and Tactics Teams  Publications The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin is published monthly by the FBI Law Enforcement Communication Unit  58  with articles of interest to state and local law enforcement personnel  First published in 1932 as Fugitives Wanted by Police  59  the FBI Law Bulletin covers topics including law enforcement technology and issues  such as crime mapping and use of force  as well as recent criminal justice research  and Vi CAP alerts  on wanted suspects and key cases  The FBI also publishes some reports for both law enforcement personnel as well as regular citizens covering topics including law enforcement  terrorism  cybercrime  white collar crime  violent crime  and statistics  60  However  the vast majority of Federal government publications covering these topics are published by the Office of Justice Programs agencies of the United States Department of Justice  and disseminated through the National Criminal Justice Reference Service  Crime statistics In the 1920s  the FBI began issuing crime reports by gathering numbers from local police departments  61  Due to limitations of this system found during the 1960s and 1970s victims often simply did not report crimes to the police in the first place the Department of Justice developed an alternate method of tallying crime  the victimization survey  61  Uniform Crime Reports Main article  Uniform Crime Reports The Uniform Crime Reports  UCR  compile data from over 17 000 law enforcement agencies across the country  They provide detailed data regarding the volume of crimes to include arrest  clearance  or closing a case   and law enforcement officer information  The UCR focuses its data collection on violent crimes  hate crimes  and property crimes  60  Created in the 1920s  the UCR system has not proven to be as uniform as its name implies  The UCR data only reflect the most serious offense in the case of connected crimes and has a very restrictive definition of rape  Since about 93  of the data submitted to the FBI is in this format  the UCR stands out as the publication of choice as most states require law enforcement agencies to submit this data  Preliminary Annual Uniform Crime Report for 2006 was released on June 4  2006  The report shows violent crime offenses rose 1 3   but the number of property crime offenses decreased 2 9  compared to 2005  62  National Incident Based Reporting System Main article  National Incident Based Reporting System The National Incident Based Reporting System  NIBRS  crime statistics system aims to address limitations inherent in UCR data  The system used by law enforcement agencies in the United States for collecting and reporting data on crimes  Local  state  and federal agencies generate NIBRS data from their records management systems  Data is collected on every incident and arrest in the Group A offense category  The Group A offenses are 46 specific crimes grouped in 22 offense categories  Specific facts about these offenses are gathered and reported in the NIBRS system  In addition to the Group A offenses  eleven Group B offenses are reported with only the arrest information  The NIBRS system is in greater detail than the summary based UCR system  As of 2004  5 271 law enforcement agencies submitted NIBRS data  That amount represents 20  of the United States population and 16  of the crime statistics data collected by the FBI  FBI files on specific persons It is possible to obtain a copy of an FBI file on oneself  on a living person who gives you permission to do so  or on a deceased individual  through the U S  Freedom of Information Act  The FBI has generated files on numerous celebrities including Elvis Presley  Frank Sinatra  John Denver  John Lennon  Jane Fonda  Groucho Marx  Charlie Chaplin  MC5  Lou Costello  Sonny Bono  Bob Dylan  Michael Jackson  Mickey Mantle  and Gene Autry  63  The FBI also profiled Jack the Ripper in 1988 but his identity still remains unproven today  64  To quote Howard Zinn   if I found that the FBI did not have any dossier on me  it would have been tremendously embarrassing and I wouldn t have been able to face my friends   65  Media portrayal Main article  FBI portrayal in the media The FBI has been frequently depicted in popular media since the 1930s  The Bureau has participated to varying degrees  which has ranged from direct involvement in the creative process of film or TV series development  to providing consultation on operations and closed cases  66  FBI personnel Edwin Atherton Ed Bethune William Mark Felt J  Edgar Hoover Richard
