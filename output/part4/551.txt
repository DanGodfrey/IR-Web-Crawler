1946 1991  encompasses the ingenuity and innovative advancements of the United States within a historical context  dating from the era of the Cold War  which have been achieved by inventors who are either native born or naturalized citizens of the United States  Copyright protection secures a person s right to his or her first to invent claim of the original invention in question  highlighted in Article I  Section 8  Clause 8 of the United States Constitution which gives the following enumerated power to the United States Congress    To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts  by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries    In 1641  the first patent in North America was issued to Samuel Winslow by the General Court of Massachusetts for a new method of making salt  3  4  5  On April 10  1790  President George Washington signed the Patent Act of 1790  1 Stat  109  into law which proclaimed that patents were to be authorized for  any useful art  manufacture  engine  machine  or device  or any improvement therein not before known or used   6  On July 31  1790  Samuel Hopkins of Pittsford  Vermont became the first person in the United States to file and to be granted a patent for an improved method of  Making Pot and Pearl Ashes   7  The Patent Act of 1836  Ch  357  5 Stat  117  further clarified United States patent law to the extent of establishing a patent office where patent applications are filed  processed  and granted  contingent upon the language and scope of the claimant s invention  for a patent term of 14 years with an extension of up to an additional 7 years  6  However  the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994  URAA  changed the patent term in the United States to a total of 20 years  effective for patent applications filed on or after June 8  1995  thus bringing United States patent law further into conformity with international patent law  8  The modern day

Space Telescope A space observatory is any instrument  such as a telescope  in outer space which is used for observation of distant planets  galaxies  and other outer space objects  In 1946  American theoretical astrophysicist Lyman Spitzer was the first to conceive the idea of a telescope in outer space  a decade before the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite  Sputnik into orbit  14  Spitzer s proposal called for a large telescope that would not be hindered by Earth s atmosphere  14  After lobbying in the 1960s and 70s for such a system to be built  Spitzer s vision ultimately materialized into the world s first space based optical telescope  Hubble Space Telescope  which was launched on April 20  1990 by the Space Shuttle Discovery  STS 31   15  16  1946 Blowout preventer  annular  An annular blowout preventer is a large valve that uses a wedge to seal off a wellhead  It has a donut like rubber seal  known as an elastomeric packing unit  reinforced with steel ribs  During drilling or well interventions  the valve may be closed if overpressure from an underground zone causes formation fluids such as oil or natural gas to enter the wellbore and threaten the rig  The annular blowout preventer was invented by Granville Sloan Knox in 1946 who received a patent on September 9  1952  17  1946 Tupperware Tupperware Tupperware is airtight plastic containers used for the preparation  storage  containment  and serving of perishable food in the kitchen and home  Tupperware was invented in 1946 by American chemist Earl Silas Tupper who devised a method of purifying black polyethylene slag  a waste product produced in oil refinement  into a molded substance that was flexible  tough  non porous  non greasy and translucent  18  Available in many colors  the plastic containers with  burp seal  did not become a commercial success until Brownie Wise  a Florida housewife  began throwing Tupperware parties in 1951 in order to demonstrate the product and explain the features  19  20  1946 Spoonplug A spoonplug is a form of fishing lure  The spoonplug was invented by Elwood L   Buck  Perry  then a physics and math teacher in Hickory  North Carolina  Elwood Perry combined science with a logical approach to fishing to create a  total fishing system   He is credited as being the father of structure fishing and was later inducted into the National Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame  21  1946 Chipper teeth An example of chipper teeth A chipper teeth is a variant of a saw chain used on a chainsaw  Using a tooth that is curled over the top of the chain  there are alternate teeth which point left and right  In 1946  American logger Joseph Buford Cox of Portland  Oregon invented chipper teeth  which is still widely used today and represents one of the biggest influences in the history of timber harvesting  22  1946 Filament tape Filament tape or strapping tape is a pressure sensitive tape used for several packaging functions such as closing corrugated fiberboard boxes  reinforcing packages  bundling items  pallet untilizing  etc  It consists of a pressure sensitive adhesive coated onto a backing material which is usually a polypropylene or polyester film and fiberglass filaments embedded to add high tensile strength  Filament tape was invented in 1946 by Cyrus Woodrow Bemmels  In 1949  it was placed on the market and was an immediate success  23  1946 Diaper  waterproof  A diaper or nappy is an absorbent garment for incontinent people  The dampless or waterproof diaper was invented in 1946 when Marion Donovan used a shower curtain from her bathroom to create the  Boater   the first re usable and leak proof diaper that contained plastic lined cloth  Donovan s other innovation was replacing safety pins with plastic snaps on the sides of diapers  First sold in 1949 at Saks Fifth Avenue s flagship store in New York City  patents were later issued in 1951 to Donovan who later sold the rights to the waterproof diaper for  1 million  24  1947 Transistor A replica of the first working transistor  In electronics  a transistor is a semiconductor device commonly used to amplify or switch electronic signals  Because the controlled output power can be much larger than the controlling input power  the transistor provides amplification of a signal  The transistor is the fundamental building block of all modern electronic devices  and is used in radio  telephone  computer  and other electronic systems  From November 17  1947 to December 23  1947  John Bardeen and Walter Brattain at AT amp T Bell Labs  underwent experimentations and finally observed that when two gold point contacts were applied to a crystal of germanium  a signal was produced whereby the output power was larger than the input  25  The manager of the Bell Labs semiconductor research group  William Shockley  saw the potential in this and worked over the next few months greatly expanding the knowledge of semiconductors in order to construct the first point contact transistor  Shockley is considered by many to be the  father  of the transistor  10  Hence  in recognition of his work  the transistor is widely  yet not universally acknowledged as the most important invention of the entire 20th century since it forms today s building blocks of processors found and used in almost every modern computing and electronics device  26  In recognition of their invention of the transistor  Shockley  Bardeen and Brattain were jointly awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics  27  1947 Defibrillator Defibrillation is the definitive treatment for the life threatening cardiac arrhythmias  ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia  Defibrillation consists of delivering a therapeutic dose of electrical energy to the affected heart  Dr  Claude Beck invented the defibrillator in 1947  28  1947 Supersonic aircraft The Bell X 1 In aerodynamics  the sound barrier usually refers to the point at which an aircraft moves from transonic to supersonic speed  On October 14  1947  just under a month after the United States Air Force had been created as a separate service  tests culminated in the first manned supersonic flight where the sound barrier was broken  piloted by Air Force Captain Chuck Yeager in the Bell X 1  29  1947 Acrylic paint Acrylic paint is fast drying paint containing pigment suspended in an acrylic polymer emulsion  The first acrylic paint was invented by Leonard Bocour and Sam Golden in 1947 under the brand Magna paint  30  1947 Magnetic particle clutch A magnetic particle clutch is a special type of electromagnetic clutch which does not use friction plates  Instead  it uses a fine powder of magnetically susceptible material  typically stainless steel  to mechanically link an otherwise free wheeling disc attached to one shaft  to a rotor attached to the other shaft  The magnetic particle cluth was invented in 1947 by Ukrainian American Jacob Rabinow  31  1948 Windsurfing Windsurfing in Maui Windsurfing  or sailboarding  is a surface water sport using a windsurf board  also commonly called a sailboard  usually two to five meters long and powered by wind pushing a sail  In 1948  20 year old Newman Darby was the first to conceive the idea of using a handheld sail and rig mounted on a universal joint so that he could control his small catamaran the first rudderless sailboard ever built that allowed a person to steer by shifting his or her weight in order to tilt the sail fore and aft  32  Darby did not file for a patent for his invention  However  he is widely recognized as the inventor of the first sailboard  33  1948 Hair spray Hair spray is a beauty aqueous solution that is used to keep hair stiff or in a certain style  Weaker than hair gel  hair wax  or glue  it is sprayed to hold styles for a long period  Using a pump or aerosol spray nozzle  it sprays evenly over the hair  Hair spray was first invented and manufactured in 1948 by Chase Products Company  based in Broadview  Illinois  1948 Cat litter Cat litter is one of any of a number of materials used in litter boxes to absorb moisture from cat feces and urine  which reduces foul odors such as ammonia and renders them more tolerable within the home  The first commercially available cat litter was Kitty Litter  available in 1948 and invented by Ed Lowe  34  1948 Halligan bar A Halligan bar is a special forcible entry tool commonly used by firefighters and law enforcement  It was designed by and named after Hugh Halligan  a First Deputy Fire Chief in the New York City Fire Department  in 1948  While the tool was developed by a Deputy Chief of the New York City Fire Department  the department did not initially purchase it because of a perceived conflict of interest in buying from a member of the department  35  1948 Hand dryer A hand dryer is an electric device found in a public restroom and are used to dry hands  It may either operate with a button  or more recently  automatically using an infrared sensor  The hand dryer was invented in 1948 by George Clemens  36  1948 Rogallo wing Rogallo s flexible wing  which was tested by NASA as a steerable parachute to retrieve Gemini space capsules and retrieve used rocket stages  The Rogallo wing is a flexible type of airfoil composed of two partial conic surfaces with both cones pointing forward  Neither a kite  glider  or a type of aircraft  the Rogallo wing is most often seen in toy kites  but has been used to construct spacecraft parachutes during preliminary testing for NASA s Gemini program in the early 1960s  dirigible parachutes  ultralight powered aircraft like the trike  as well as hang gliders  Before the end of 1948  American aeronautical engineer Francis Rogallo had succeeded in inventing the first fully successful flexible wing kite that he called the  Flexi Kite   A patent was applied for in 1948 and granted in 1951  His wife  Gertrude Rogallo  also made a significant impact upon the invention  having sewed the fabric into the required dimensions that used household items like kitchen curtains  Rogallo believed that flexible wings provided more stability than fixed surfaces  leading to an elimination of rigid spars during flight  Because of this  Rogallo s concepts are seen as classics examples of purity and efficiency in aviation  37  38  1948 Cable television Cable television provides television to consumers via radio frequency signals transmitted to televisions through fixed optical fibers or coaxial cables as opposed to the over the air method used in traditional television broadcasting  First known as Community Antenna Television or CATV  cable television was born in the mountains of Pennsylvania in 1948 by John Walson and Margaret Walson  39  1948 Flying disc Flying discs are disc shaped objects thrown and caught for recreation  which are generally plastic and roughly 20 to 25 centimeters  8 10 inches  in diameter  with a lip  The shape of the disc  an airfoil in cross section  allows it to fly by generating lift as it moves through the air while rotating  First known as the  Whirlo Way   the flying disc was invented in 1949 by Walter Frederick Morrison who combined his fascination with invention and his interest in flight  Carved from a solid block of a plastic compound known as  Tenite   Morrison sold his flying disc invention to WHAM O  which introduced it in 1957 as the  Pluto Platter   In 1958  WHAM O modified the  Pluto Platter  and introduced the  FRISBIE  flying disc to the world  It became an instant sensation  40  1948

from the Holter monitor  The functions of a Holter monitor captures and records information such as heart rates during day and night  abnormal heart beats  and normal and abnormal heart rhythms  The Holter monitor was invented by Norman Holter  46  1949 Crash test dummy Head  neck  and thoracic spine of a crash test dummy A crash test dummy is a full scale anthropomorphic test device that simulates the dimensions  weight proportions and articulation of the human body  and is usually instrumented to record data about the dynamic behavior of the ATD in simulated vehicle impacts  Using human and animal cadaver research from earlier studies  the first artificial crash test dummy was an anthropomorphic dummy named  Sierra Sam   It was invented in 1949 by Samuel W  Alderson at his Alderson Research Labs  ARL  And Sierra Engineering Co  for the United States Air Force while conducting tests on aircraft ejection seats  pilot restraint harnesses  and aviation helmets  47  48  Alderson s early dummies and those of his competitors were fairly primitive  with no pelvic structure and little spinal articulation  With American automakers interested in durable crash test dummies that could be tested and retested while yielding back a brioad spectrum of data during simulated automobile crashes  the first crash test dummy used for automative testing was again invented by Samuel Alderson in 1968  It was called the V I P   Very Important Person  and it was built with dimensions of an average adult man coupled with a steel rib cage  articulated joints  a flexible neck  and a lumbar spine  49  1949 Compiler A compiler is a computer program or set of programs that transforms source code written in a computerized source language into another computer language often having a binary form known as an object code  The most common reason for wanting to transform source code is to create an executable program  The first compiler written for the A 0 programming language is attributed to its inventor  Grace Hopper in 1949  50  1949 Aerosol paint Aerosol paint  also called spray paint  is a type of paint that comes in a sealed pressurized container and is released in a fine spray mist when depressing a valve button  A form of spray painting  aerosol paint leaves a smooth  evenly coated surface  unlike many rolled or brushed paints  In 1949  Ed Seymour of Sycamore  Illinois invented aerosol paint  which he based on the same principle as spray deodorizers and insecticides  The conveyance featured a small can of paint packaged with an aerosol propellant and fitted with a spray head  51   edit  The Fifties  1950 1959  1950 Artificial snowmaking A rear view of a snow cannon with its fan showing Snowmaking is the artificial production of snow by forcing water and pressurized air through a  snow gun  or  snow cannon   on ski slopes  Snowmaking is mainly used at ski resorts to supplement natural snow  This allows ski resorts to improve the reliability of their snow cover and to extend their ski seasons  The costly production of snowmaking requires low temperatures  The threshold temperature for snowmaking decreases as humidity decreases  Machine made snow was first co invented by three engineers Art Hunt  Dave Richey and Wayne Pierce of Milford  Connecticut on March 14  1950  Their patented invention of the first  snow cannon  used a garden hose  a 10 horsepower compressor  and a spray gun nozzle  which produced about 20 inches of snow  52  1950 Credit card A credit card is part of a system of payments named after the small plastic card issued to users of the system  The issuer of the card grants a line of credit to the consumer from which the user can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance to the user  The concept of paying different merchants using the same card was invented in 1950 by Ralph Schneider and Frank X  McNamara  founders of Diners Club  to consolidate multiple cards  53  1950 Leaf blower A leaf blower is a gardening tool that propels air out of a nozzle to move yard debris such as leaves  Leaf blowers are usually powered by two stroke engine or an electric motor  but four stroke engines were recently introduced to partially address air pollution concerns  Leaf blowers are typically self contained handheld units  or backpack mounted units with a handheld wand  The leaf blower was invented by Dom Quinto in 1950  54  1950 Hamming code In telecommunication  a Hamming code is a linear error correcting code  Hamming codes can detect up to two simultaneous bit errors  and correct single bit errors  thus  reliable communication is possible when the Hamming distance between the transmitted and received bit patterns is less than or equal to one  By contrast  the simple parity code cannot correct errors  and can only detect an odd number of errors  Hamming codes are of fundamental importance in coding theory and remain of practical use in modern computer design  Hamming codes were invented in 1950 by Richard Hamming at Bell Labs  55  1950 Teleprompter A set of three teleprompters displaying text in the Japanese language A teleprompter is a display device that prompts the person speaking with an electronic visual text of a speech or script  Using a teleprompter is similar to the practice of using cue cards  The screen is in front of and usually below the lens of the camera  and the words on the screen are reflected to the eyes of the performer using a sheet of clear glass or specially prepared beam splitter  The teleprompter was invented in 1950 by Hubert Schlafly  who was working at 20th Century Fox film studios in Los Angeles  56  1950 Sengstaken Blakemore tube A Sengstaken Blakemore tube is an oro or nasogastric tube used occasionally in the management of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage due to bleeding from esophageal varices which are distended veins in the esophageal wall  usually as a result of cirrhosis  It consists of a gastric balloon  an esophageal balloon  and a gastric suction port  The Sengstaken Blakemore tube was invented by Dr  Robert W  Sengstaken and Dr  Arthur H  Blakemore in 1950  57  1951 Stellarator A stellarator is a device used to confine a hot plasma with magnetic fields in order to sustain a controlled nuclear fusion reaction  It is the earliest controlled fusion device  In 1951  American astrophyscist Lyman Spitzer recommended that the United States Atomic Energy Commission commence containing and harnessing nuclear fusion of hydrogen at temperatures exceeding those at the Sun s surface  To do this  Spitzer invented a plasma confinement configuration device called the stellarator  58  1951 Cooler A cool box  cooler  portable ice chest  chilly bin  or esky most commonly is an insulated box used to keep perishable food or beverages cool  Ice cubes  which are very cold  are most commonly placed in it to make the things inside stay cool  Ice packs are sometimes used  as they either contain the melting water inside  or have a gel sealed inside that also stays cold longer than plain water  The cooler was invented in 1951 by Richard C  Laramy of Joliet  Illinois  Laramy filed a patent for the cooler on February 24  1951 and was issued U S  patent  2 663 157 on December 22  1953  59  1951 Wetsuit A wetsuit is a garment  usually made of foamed neoprene  which is worn by divers  windsurfers  canoeists  and others engaged in water sports  providing thermal insulation  abrasion resistance and buoyancy  The insulation properties depend on bubbles of gas enclosed within the material  which reduce its ability to conduct heat  The bubbles also give the wetsuit a low density  providing buoyancy in water  The wetsuit was invented in 1951 by the University of California at Berkeley physicist named Hugh Bradner  60  1951 Correction fluid Correction fluid is an opaque  white fluid applied to paper to mask errors in text  It was very important when material was typed with a typewriter  but has become less so since the advent of the word processor  Correction fluid was invented by Bette Nesmith Graham in 1951  Originally called by the brand name  Mistake Out   Graham began selling correction fluid in 1956  61  1951 Well counter A well counter is a device used for measuring radioactivity in small samples  It usually employs a sodium iodide crystal detector  It was invented in 1951 by American lectrical engineer and biophysicist Hal Anger  62  Anger filed U S  patent  2 779 876 on March 3  1953 for his  Radio Activity Distribution Detector  which was later issued on January 29  1957  63  1952 Airbag A deflated airbag on a steering wheel after a traffic accident An air bag is a safety feature designed to protect automobile passengers in a head on collision  Most cars today have driver s side airbags and many have one on the passenger side as well  Located in the steering wheel assembly on the driver s side and in the dashboard on the passenger side  the air bag device responds within milliseconds of a crash  The original safety cushion was first created by John W  Hetrick in 1952  After a car accident that his family was involved in  Hetrick drew sketches of compressed air stored in a container  When a spring loaded weight senses the car decelerating at a rapid enough rate  it opens a valve that allows the pressure in the container to fill a bag  With this knowledge  he developed his design until he was able to obtain a patent on the device on August 5  1952  64  Later in 1967  Dr  Allen S  Breed invented and developed a key component for automotive use in 1967  the ball in tube inertial sensor for crash detection  Breed Corporation then marketed this innovation to Chrysler  65  1952 Bread clip A bread clip is a device used to hold plastic bags  such as the ones pre sliced bread is commonly packaged in  closed  They are also commonly called bread tags  bread tabs  bread ties  bread crimps  or bread bag clips  By sealing a bag more securely than tying or folding over its open end  the clip or tie may preserve its contents longer  The bread clip was invented in 1952 by Floyd Paxton of Yakima  Washington  Paxton never patented the device  66  1952 Barcode A UPC A barcode symbol A barcode is an optical machine readable representation of data  which shows certain data on certain products  Originally  barcodes represented data in the widths  lines  and the spacings of parallel lines  and may be referred to as linear or 1 dimensional barcodes or symbologies  They also come in patterns of squares  dots  hexagons and other geometric patterns within images termed 2 dimensional matrix codes or symbologies  Norman Joseph Woodland is best known for inventing the barcode for which he received a patent in October 1952  67  1952 Artificial heart An artificial heart is implanted into the body to replace the biological heart  On July 3  1952  41 year old Henry Opitek suffering from shortness of breath made medical history at Harper University Hospital at Wayne State University in Michigan  The Dodrill GMR heart  considered to be the first operational mechanical heart  was invented by Dr  Forest Dewey Dodrill and successfully inserted into Henry Opitek while performing open heart surgery  68  In 1981  Dr  Robert Jarvik implanted the world s first permanent artificial heart  69  the Jarvik 7  into Dr  Barney Clark  The heart  powered by an external compressor  kept Clark alive for 112 days  The Jarvik heart was not banned for permanent use  Since 1982  more than 350 people have received the Jarvik heart as a bridge to transplantation  70  1953 Heart lung machine Dr  John Heysham Gibbon performed the first successful cardiopulmonary bypass surgery in which the blood was artificially circulated and oxygenated by using his invention  a pump known as the heart lung machine  This new medical technology  which allowed the surgeon to operate on a dry and motionless heart by maintaining the circulation of blood and the oxygen content of the body  greatly increased surgical treatment options for heart defects and disease  71  1953 Voltmeter  digital  A voltmeter is an instrument used for measuring electrical potential difference between two points in an electric circuit  Analog voltmeters move a pointer across a scale in proportion to the voltage of the circuit  digital voltmeters give a numerical display of voltage by use of an analog to digital converter  The digital voltmeter was invented in 1953 by Andrew Kay  founder of Kaypro  72  1953 Marker pen A marker pen  marking pen  felt tip pen  or marker  is a pen which has its own colored ink source  and usually a tip made of a porous material  such as felt or nylon  Sidney Rosenthal  from Richmond Hill  New York  is credited with inventing the marker in 1953  73  1953 WD 40 WD 40 is a widely available water displacing spray that is useful in both home and commercial fields  lubricating and loosening joints and hinges  removing dirt and residue  and extricating stuck screws and bolts are common usages  The product also may be useful in displacing moisture  as this is its original purpose and design intent  WD 40 was invented in 1953 by Norm Larsen and two other employees at the Rocket Chemical Company in San Diego  California  74  1953 Apgar scale The Apgar scale is used to determine the physical status of an infant at birth  The Apgar scale is administered to a newborn at one minute after birth and five minutes after birth  It scores the baby s heart rate  respiration  muscle tone  reflex response  and color  This test quickly alerts medical personnel that the newborn needs assistance  This simple  easy to perform test was invented in 1953 by Dr  Virginia Apgar  a professor of anesthesia at the New York Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center  75  1953 Gilhoolie A gilhoolie is a kitchen appliance that opens jars and bottles  It was invented by Dr  C  W  Fuller in 1953  76  1953 Wheel clamp A wheel clamp  also known as a Denver boot or wheel boot  is a device that is designed to prevent vehicles from moving  In its most common form  it consists of a clamp which surrounds a vehicle wheel  designed to prevent removal of both itself and the wheel  Wheel clamps are used in order to enforce laws against unauthorized or illegal parking  in lieu of towing the offending vehicle  and for security purposes such as a deterrent against stolen vehicles by thieves  Originally known as the auto immobilizer  the wheel clamp or Denver boot was invented in 1953 by Frank Marugg of Denver Colorado  A patent was filed on May 7  1955 and issued three years later on July 28  1958  77  1953 Wiffle ball Wiffleball is a variation of the sport of baseball designed for indoor or outdoor play in confined areas  The game is played using a perforated  light weight  hollow  rubbery plastic ball and a long  hollow  plastic and typically a yellow bat  The Wiffle ball was invented by David N  Mullany of Fairfield  Connecticut in 1953 when he designed a ball that curved easily for his 12 year old son  It was named when his son and his friends would refer to a strikeout as a  whiff   78  1953 MASER A maser is produces coherent electromagnetic waves through amplification due to stimulated emission  Historically the term came from the acronym  Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation   Charles H  Townes  J  P  Gordon  and H  J  Zeiger built the first maser at Columbia University in 1953  79  1953 Carbonless copy paper Carbonless copy paper is an alternative to carbon paper  used to make a copy of an original  handwritten document without the use of any electronics  Carbonless copy paper was invented by chemists Lowell Schleicher and Barry Green  working

light  strong para aramid synthetic fiber  Typically it is spun into ropes or fabric sheets that can be used as such or as an ingredient in composite material components  Currently  Kevlar has many applications  ranging from bicycle tires and racing sails to body armor because of its high strength to weight ratio  Invented at DuPont in 1965 by Stephanie Kwolek  Kevlar was first commercially used in the early 1970s as a replacement for steel in racing tires  168  1965 Hypertext Hypertext most often refers to text on a computer that will lead the user to other  related information on demand  It is a relatively recent innovation to user interfaces  which overcomes some of the limitations of written text  Rather than remaining static like traditional text  hypertext makes possible a dynamic organization of information through links and connections called hyperlinks  Ted Nelson coined the words  hypertext  and  hypermedia  in 1965 and invented the Hypertext Editing System in 1968 at Brown University  169  1965 Cordless telephone A cordless telephone is a telephone with a wireless handset that communicates via radio waves with a base station connected to a fixed telephone line  usually within a limited range of its base station  The base station is on the subscriber premises  and attaches to the telephone network the same way a corded telephone does  In 1965  an American woman named Teri Pall invented the cordless telephone  Due to difficulties of marketing  Pall never patented her invention  George Sweigert of Euclid  Ohio had more success  thus receiving a patent for the cordless telephone in 1969  170  1965 Space pen The Space Pen  also known as the Zero Gravity Pen  is a pen that uses pressurized ink cartridges and is claimed to write in zero gravity  upside down  underwater  over wet and greasy paper  at any angle  and in extreme temperature ranges  The ballpoint is made from tungsten carbide and is precisely fitted in order to avoid leaks  A sliding float separates the ink from the pressurized gas  The thixotropic ink in the hermetically sealed and pressurized reservoir is claimed to write for three times longer than a standard ballpoint pen  In 1965  the space pen was invented and patented by Paul C  Fisher  After two years of testing at NASA  the space pen was first used during the Apollo 7 mission in 1968  171  1965 Minicomputer A minicomputer

several hundred units  172  1965 Compact Disc The Compact Disc  or CD  is an optical disc used to store digital data  originally developed for storing digital audio  In 1965  James Russell acted upon his idea that the music industry needed a new medium whereby a gramophone record and the needle on a phonograph would no longer come into contact with one another  With an interest in lasers  Russell soon began his research in an optical system that would replace a phonograph s needle and replace it with a laser that would read codes in order to record and playback sound  173  174  At 12 inches  30 cm  in diameter  Russell in 1970 had successfully invented and built the world s first compact disc that contained digitized codes etched onto the disc that could be read from a laser  175  176  177  178  After partnering with Digital Recording which was later acquired by Optical Recording Corporation  Russell and the parent company that he worked for  found it increasingly difficult to enforce and protect his patents from infringement by competitors such as Sony  Philips  and Time Warner who all profited from Russell s invention  The belief that Dutch and Japanese scientists  invented  the compact disc is a misconception in the sense that Philips and Sony used Russell s underlying technology in order to develop a disc more refined  practical  smaller and sophisticated  In 1982  Sony and Philips had commercially introduced the compact disc  twelve years after Russell had already created a working prototype in 1970  By 1986  Optical Recording decided to legally act by suing Sony  Phillips  and Time Warner  Two years later  the company came to a licensing settlement with Sony and soon thereafter  agreements with Phillips and others soon followed  including a June 1992 court ruling that required Time Warner to pay Optical Recording  30 million due to patent infringement  179  180  1965 Chemical laser A chemical laser is a laser that obtains its energy from a chemical reaction  Chemical lasers can achieve continuous wave output with power reaching to megawatt levels  They are used in industry for cutting and drilling  and in military as directed energy

The three way catalytic converter was co invented by John J  Mooney and Carl D  Keith at the Engelhard Corporation in 1973  224  1973 Mobile phone The mobile phone A mobile phone  or cell phone  is a long range  electronic device used for mobile voice or data communication over a network of specialized base stations known as cell sites  Early mobile FM radio telephones were in use for many years  but since the number of radio frequencies were very limited in any area  the number of phone calls were also very limited  To solve this problem  there could be many small areas called cells which share the same frequencies  When users moved from one area to another while calling  the call would have to be switched over automatically without losing the call  In this system  a small number of radio frequencies could accommodate a huge number of calls  The first mobile call was made from a car phone in St  Louis  Missouri on June 17  1946  but the system was impractical from what is considered a portable handset today  The equipment weighed 80 lbs  and the AT amp T service  basically a massive party line  cost  30 per month plus 30 to 40 cents per local call  225  The basic network and supporting infrastructure of hexagonal cells used to support a mobile telephony system while remaining on the same channel were devised by Douglas H  Ring and W  Rae Young at AT amp T Bell Labs in 1947  Finally in 1973  Martin Cooper invented the first handheld cellular mobile phone  His first mobile phone call was made to Joel S  Engel in April 1973  13  226  1973 Voicemail Voicemail is the managing of telephone messages from a centralized data storing system  Vociemail is stored on hard disk drives  media generally used by computers in order to store other forms of data  Messages
