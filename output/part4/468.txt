Governors Legislatures  List  State courts Local government Other countries   Atlas Politics portal v t e The Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the United States of America  The first three Articles of the Constitution establish the rules and separate powers of the three branches of the federal government  a legislature  the bicameral Congress  an executive branch led by the President  and a federal judiciary headed by the Supreme Court  The last four Articles frame the principle of federalism  The Tenth Amendment confirms its federal characteristics  The Constitution was adopted on September 17  1787  by the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia  Pennsylvania  and ratified by conventions in eleven states  The first ten amendments are known as the Bill of Rights  The Constitution has been amended seventeen times  for a total of 27 amendments  and its principles are applied in courts of law by judicial review  The Constitution guides American society in law and political culture  It is the oldest charter of supreme law in continuous use  and it influenced later international figures establishing national constitutions  Recent impulses for reform center on concerns for extending democracy and balancing the Federal budget  Contents 1 History 1 1 First government 1 2 Constitutional Convention 1 2 1 Drafting the Constitution 2 Ratification 2 1 Historical

States Constitution First government Main article  Articles of Confederation The Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union were the first constitution of the United States of America  1  The problem with the United States government under the Articles of Confederation was  in the words of George Washington   no money   2  Congress could print money  but by 1786  the money was useless  Congress could borrow money  but could not pay it back  2  No state paid all of their U S  taxes  Georgia paid nothing  Some few paid an amount equal to interest on the national debt owed to their citizens  but no more  2  No interest was paid on debt owed foreign governments  By 1786  the United States would default on the dates the principal came due  2  The United States could not defend itself as an independent nation in the world of 1787  Most of the U S  troops in the 625 man U S  Army were deployed facing British forts on American soil  The troops had not been paid  some were deserting and the remainder threatened mutiny  3 Spain closed New Orleans to American commerce  The United States protested  to no effect  The Barbary Pirates began seizing American commercial ships  The Treasury had no funds to pay the pirates  extortion demands  The Congress had no more credit if another military crisis had required action  2  The states were proving inadequate to the requirements of sovereignty in a confederation  Although the 1783 Treaty of Paris had been made between Great Britain and the United States with each state named individually  individual states violated their peace treaty with Britain  New York and South Carolina repeatedly prosecuted Loyalists for wartime activity and redistributed their lands over the protests of both Great Britain and the Articles Congress  2  In Massachusetts during Shays  Rebellion  Congress had no money to support a constituent state  nor could Massachusetts pay for its own internal defense  General Benjamin Lincoln had to raise funds among Boston merchants to pay for a volunteer army  4  During the upcoming Convention  James Madison angrily questioned whether the Articles of Confederation was a compact or even government  Connecticut paid nothing and  positively refused  to pay U S  assessments for two years  5  A rumor had it that a  seditious party  of New York legislators had opened communication with the Viceroy of Canada  To the south  the British were said to be funding the Creek Indian raids  Savannah was fortified  the State of Georgia under martial law  6  Congress was paralyzed  It could do nothing significant without nine states  and some legislative business required all thirteen  When only one member of a state was on the floor  then that state s vote did not count  If a delegation were evenly divided  no vote counted towards the nine count requirement  7  Individual state legislatures independently laid embargoes  negotiated directly with foreigners  raised armies and made war  all violating the letter and the spirit of the  Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union   The Articles Congress had  virtually ceased trying to govern   8  The vision of a  respectable nation  among nations seemed to be fading in the eyes of revolutionaries such as George Washington  Benjamin Franklin and Rufus King  The dream of a republic  a nation without hereditary rulers  with power derived from the people in frequent elections  was in doubt  9  Constitutional Convention Main article  Constitutional Convention  United States  On February 21  1787  the Articles Congress called a convention of state delegates at Philadelphia to propose a plan of government  Unlike earlier attempts  the convention was not meant for new laws or piecemeal alterations  but for the  sole and express purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation   The convention was not limited to commerce  rather  it was intended to  render the federal constitution adequate to the exigencies of government and the preservation of the Union   The proposal might take effect when approved by Congress and the states  10  On the appointed day  May 14  only the Virginia and Pennsylvania delegations were present  A quorum of seven states met on May 25  Eventually twelve states were represented  74 delegates were named  55 attended and 36 signed  The delegates arrived with backgrounds in local and state government and Congress  They were judges and merchants  war veterans and revolutionary patriots  native born and immigrant  establishment easterners and westward looking adventurers  The participating delegates are honored as the Constitution s  Framers   11  Drafting the Constitution Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States by Howard Chandler Christy  The Constitutional Convention began deliberations on May 25  1787  The delegates were generally convinced that an effective central government with a wide range of enforceable powers must replace the weaker Congress established by the Articles of Confederation  The high quality of the delegates to the convention was remarkable  As Thomas Jefferson in Paris wrote to John Adams in London   It really is an assembly of demigods   Delegates used two streams of intellectual tradition  and any one delegate could be found using both or a mixture depending on the subject under discussion  foreign affairs or the economy  national government or federal relationships among the states  The Virginia Plan recommended a consolidated national government  generally favoring the big population states  It used the philosophy of John Locke to rely on consent of the governed  Montesquieu for divided government  and Edward Coke emphasizing equity in outcomes citation needed   The New Jersey Plan generally favored the small population states  using the philosophy of English Whigs such as Edmund Burke to rely on received procedure  and William Blackstone emphasizing sovereignty of the legislature  The Convention devolved into a  Committee of the Whole  to consider the fifteen propositions of the Virginia Plan in their numerical order  These discussions continued until June 13  when the Virginia resolutions in amended form were reported out of committee  All agreed to a republican form of government grounded in representing the people in the states  For the legislature  two issues were to be decided   1  how the votes were to be allocated among the states in the Congress  and  2  how the representatives should be elected  The question was settled by the Connecticut Compromise or  Great Compromise   In the House  state power was to be based on population and the people would vote  In the Senate  state power was to be based on state legislature election  two Senators generally to be elected by different state legislatures to better reflect the long term interests of the people living in each state  The Great Compromise ended the stalemate between  patriots  and  nationalists   leading to numerous other compromises in a spirit of accommodation  There were sectional interests to be balanced by the three fifths compromise  reconciliation on Presidential term  powers  and method of selection  jurisdiction the federal judiciary  Debates on the Virginia resolutions continued  The 15 original resolutions had been expanded into 23  On July 24  a committee of five  John Rutledge  SC   Edmund Randolph  VA   Nathaniel Gorham  MA   Oliver Ellsworth  CT   and James Wilson  PA  was elected to draft a detailed constitution  The Convention adjourned from July 26 to August 6 to await the report of this  Committee of Detail   Overall  the report of the committee conformed to the resolutions adopted by the Convention  adding some elements  From August 6 to September 10  the report of the committee of detail was discussed  section by section  and clause by clause  Details were attended to  further compromises were effected  Toward the close of these discussions  on September 8  another committee of five  William Samuel Johnson  CT   Alexander Hamilton  NY   Gouverneur Morris  PA   James Madison  VA   and Rufus King  MA   was appointed  to revise the style of and arrange the articles which had been agreed to by the house   On Wednesday  September 12  the report of the  committee of style  was ordered printed for the convenience of the delegates  For three days  the Convention compared this report with the proceedings of the Convention  The Constitution was then ordered engrossed on Saturday  September 15 by Jacob Shallus  The Convention met on Monday  September 17  for its final session  Several of the delegates were disappointed in the result  a makeshift series of unfortunate compromises  Some delegates left before the ceremony  three remaining refused to sign  Of the thirty nine signers  Benjamin Franklin summed up addressing the Convention   There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve  but I am not sure I shall never approve them   He would accept the Constitution   because I expect no better and because I am not sure that it is not the best   The advocates of the Constitution were anxious to obtain the unanimous support of all twelve states represented in Convention  Their agreed to formula was   Done in Convention  by the unanimous consent of the States present   George Washington noted in his diary that night  the proposal was agreed to by eleven state delegations and the lone Mr  Hamilton for New York  Transmitted to the Articles Congress then sitting in New York City  the Constitution was forwarded to the states by Congress recommending the ratification process outlined in the Constitution  Each state legislature was to call elections for a  Federal Convention  to ratify the Constitution  They expanded the franchise beyond the Constitutional requirement to more nearly embrace  the people   Eleven of the thirteen ratified to begin  all thirteen unanimously did so a year later  The Articles Congress certified eleven states beginning the new government  and called the states to hold elections to begin operation  It then dissolved itself on that date  the day the first session of the First Congress began March 4  1789 and George Washington was inaugurated as President two months later  Ratification The 13 colonies in 1775 It was within the power of the old congress to expedite or block the ratification of the new Constitution  The document that the Philadelphia Convention presented was technically only a revision of the Articles of Confederation  But the last article of the new instrument provided that when ratified by conventions in nine states  or 2 3 at the time   it should go into effect among the States so acting  Then followed an arduous process of ratification of the Constitution by specially constituted conventions  The need for only nine states was a controversial decision at the time  since the Articles of Confederation could only be amended by unanimous vote of all the states  However  the new Constitution was ratified by all thirteen states  with Rhode Island signing on last in May 1790  Three members of the Convention   Madison  Gorham  and King   were also Members of Congress  They proceeded at once to New York  where Congress was in session  to placate the expected opposition  Aware of their vanishing authority  Congress  on September 28  after some debate  unanimously decided to submit the Constitution to the States for action  It made no recommendation for or against adoption  12  Two parties soon developed  one in opposition  the Antifederalists  and one in support  the Federalists  of the Constitution  and the Constitution was debated  criticized  and expounded clause by clause  Hamilton  Madison  and Jay  under the name of  Publius  wrote a series of commentaries  now known as the Federalist Papers  in support of the new instrument of government  however  the primary aim of the essays was for ratification in the state of New York  at that time a hotbed of anti federalism  These commentaries on the Constitution  written during the struggle for ratification  have been frequently cited by the Supreme Court as an authoritative contemporary interpretation of the meaning of its provisions  The closeness and bitterness of the struggle over ratification and the conferring of additional powers on the central government can scarcely be exaggerated  In some states  ratification was effected only after a bitter struggle in the state convention itself  In every state  the Federalists proved more united  and only they coordinated action between different states  as the Anti federalists were localized and did not attempt to reach out to other states  Delaware  on December 7  1787  became the first State to ratify the new Constitution  with its vote being unanimous  Pennsylvania ratified on December 12  1787  by a vote of 46 to 23  66 67    New Jersey ratified on December 19  1787  and Georgia on January 2  1788  both with unanimous votes  The requirement of ratification by nine states  set by Article Seven of the Constitution  was met when New Hampshire voted to ratify  on June 21  1788  In New York  fully two thirds of the convention delegates were at first opposed to the Constitution  Hamilton led the Federalist campaign  which included the fast paced appearance of the Federalist Papers in New York newspapers  An attempt to attach conditions to ratification almost succeeded  but on July 26  1788  New York ratified  with a recommendation that a bill of rights be appended  The vote was close   yeas 30  52 6    nays 27   due largely to Hamilton s forensic abilities and his reaching a few key compromises with moderate anti Federalists led by Melancton Smith  a  The Continental Congress   which still functioned at irregular intervals   passed a resolution on September 13  1788  to put the new Constitution into operation  Historical influences Fundamental law Several ideas in the Constitution were new  These were associated with the combination of consolidated government along with federal relationships with constituent states  Enlightenment and Rule of law John LockeTwo Treatises of Government life  liberty and property The due process clause of the Constitution was partly based on common law stretching back to Magna Carta  1215   citation needed  The document established the principle that the Crown s powers could be limited  The  law of the land  was the King in Parliament of Lords and Commons  The once sovereign King was to be bound by law  Magna Carta as  sacred text  would become a foundation of English liberty against arbitrary power wielded by a tyrant  Both the influence of Edward Coke and William Blackstone were evident at the Convention  In his Institutes of the Laws of England  Edward Coke interpreted Magna Carta protections and rights to apply not just to nobles  but to all British subjects of the Crown equally  Coke extended this principle overseas to colonists  In writing the Virginia Charter of 1606  he enabled the King in Parliament to give those to be born in the colonies all rights and liberties as though they were born in England  William Blackstone s  Commentaries on the Laws of England  were the most influential books on law in the new republic among both lawyers generally and judges  The most important influence from the European continent was from Enlightenment thinkers John Locke and Montesquieu  British political philosopher John Locke following the Glorious Revolution was a major influence expanding on the contract theory of government advanced by Thomas Hobbes  Locke advanced the principle of consent of the governed in his  Two Treatises of Government   Government s duty in a social contract with the sovereign people was to serve them by protecting their rights  These basic rights of English and by extension all humanity  were life  liberty and property  Montesquieu  emphasized the need to have balanced forces pushing against each other to prevent tyranny  this in itself reflects the influence of Polybius s 2nd century BC treatise on the checks and balances of the constitution of the Roman Republic   In his  The Spirit of the Laws   Montesquieu argues that the separation of state powers should be by its service to the people s liberty  legislative  executive and judicial  Division of power in a republic was informed by the British experience with mixed government  as well as study of republics ancient and modern  A substantial body of thought had been developed from the literature of republicanism in the United States  including work by John Adams  The experiences among the thirteen states after 1776 was remarkably different among those which had been charter  proprietary newly created royal colonies  Native Americans The Iroquois nations  political confederacy and democratic government under the Great Law of Peace have been credited as influences on the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution  13  Relations had long been close  as from the beginning the colonial English needed allies against New France  Prominent figures such as Thomas Jefferson in colonial Virginia and Benjamin Franklin in colonial Pennsylvania  two colonies whose territorial claims extended into Iroquois territory  were involved with leaders of the New York based Iroquois Confederacy  14  In the 1750s at the Albany Congress  Franklin called for  some kind of union  of English colonies to effectively deal with Amerindian tribes  15  John Rutledge  SC  quoted Iroquoian law to the Constitutional Convention   We  the people  to form a union  to establish peace  equity  and order      16  The Iroquois experience with confederacy was both a model and a cautionary tale  Their  Grand Council  had no coercive control over the constituent members  and decentralization of authority and power had frequently plagued the Six Nations since the coming of the Europeans  The governance adopted by the Iroquois suffered from  too much democracy  and the long term independence of the Iroquois confederation suffered from intrigues within each Iroquois nation  17  The 1787 United States had similar problems  with individual states making separate agreements with European and Amerindian nations apart from the Continental Congress  Without the Convention s proposed central government  the framer s feared that the fate of the confederated Articles  United States would be the same as the Iroquois Confederacy  Bills of rights before The United States Bill of Rights consists of the ten amendments added to the Constitution in 1791  as supporters of the Constitution had promised critics during the debates of 1788  18  The English Bill of Rights  1689  was an inspiration for the American Bill of Rights  Both require jury trials  contain a right to keep and bear arms  prohibit excessive bail and forbid  cruel and unusual punishments   Many liberties protected by state constitutions and the Virginia Declaration of Rights were incorporated into the Bill of Rights  Original text The Constitution consists of a preamble  seven original articles  twenty seven amendments  and a paragraph certifying its enactment by the constitutional convention  Authority and purpose  We the People   as it appears in an original copy of the Constitution  Main article  Preamble to the United States Constitution See also  wikisource Constitution of the United States of America Preamble We the People of the United States  in Order to form a more perfect Union  establish Justice  insure domestic Tranquility  provide for the common defence  promote the general Welfare  and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity  do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America  The Preamble sets out the origin  scope and purpose of the Constitution  Its origin and authority is in  We  the people of the United States   This echoes the Declaration of Independence   One people  dissolved their connection with another  and assumed among the powers of the earth  a sovereign nation state  The scope of the Constitution is twofold  First   to form a more perfect Union  than had previously existed in the  perpetual Union  of the Articles of Confederation  Second  to  secure the blessings of liberty   which were to be enjoyed by not only the first generation  but for all who came after   our posterity   19  This is an itemized social contract of democratic philosophy  It details how the more perfect union was to be carried out between the national government and the people  The people are to be provided  a  justice   b  civil peace   c  common defense   d  those things of a general welfare that they could not provide themselves  and  e  freedom  A government of  liberty and union  now and forever   unfolds when  We  begin and establish this Constitution  b  21  National government Legislature Main article  Article One of the United States Constitution See also  wikisource Constitution of the United States of America Article I Old House Wing  left U S  Capitol Old House ChamberOld House Wing Old Senate WingU S  Capitol  north  Old Senate ChamberOld Senate Wing Article One describes the Congress  the legislative branch of the federal government  The United States Congress is a bicameral body consisting of two co equal houses  the House of Representatives and the Senate  The article establishes the manner of election and the qualifications of members of each body  Representatives must be at least 25 years old  be a citizen of the United States for seven years  and live in the state they represent  Senators must be at least 30 years old  be a citizen for nine years  and live in the state they represent  Article I  Section 1  reads   All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States  which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives   Article I  Section 8 enumerates the legislative powers  which include  To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers  and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States  or in any department or officer thereof  Article I  Section 9 provides a list of eight specific limits on congressional power and Article I  Section 10 limits the rights of the states  The United States Supreme Court has interpreted the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause in Article One to allow Congress to enact legislation that is neither expressly listed in the enumerated power nor expressly denied in the limitations on Congress  In McCulloch v  Maryland  1819   the United States Supreme Court fell back on the strict construction of the necessary and proper clause to read that Congress had   t he foregoing powers and all other powers     Executive Main article  Article Two of the United States Constitution See also  wikisource Constitution of the United States of America Article II Article II  Section 1 creates the presidency  The section states that the executive power is vested in a President  The presidential term is four years and the Vice President serves the identical term  This section originally set the method of electing the President and Vice President  but this method has been superseded by the Twelfth Amendment  Qualifications The President must be a natural born citizen of the United States  at least 35 years old and a resident of the United States for at least 14 years  An obsolete part of this clause provides that instead of being a natural born citizen  a person may be a citizen at the time of the adoption of the Constitution  This clause is sometimes said to have been written for the benefit of Alexander Hamilton  who was born in Nevis  22  The first president to be born an American citizen was Martin Van Buren  23  Succession Section 1 specifies that the Vice President succeeds to the presidency if the President is removed  unable to discharge the powers and duties of office  dies while in office  or resigns  The original text   the same shall devolve   left it unclear whether this succession was intended to be on an acting basis  merely taking on the powers of the office  or permanent  assuming the Presidency itself   After the death of William Henry Harrison  John Tyler set the precedent that the succession was permanent  this practice was followed when later presidents died in office  Today the 25th Amendment states that the Vice President becomes President upon the death or disability of the President  Pay The President receives  Compensation  for being the president  and this compensation may not be increased or decreased during the president s term in office  The president may not receive other compensation from either the United States or any of the individual states  The President s HouseWashington  DC James Hoban designThe President s House Oath of office The final clause creates the presidential oath to preserve  protect  and defend the Constitution  Section 2 grants substantive powers to the president  The president is the Commander in Chief of the United States Armed Forces  and of the state militias when these are called into federal service  The president may require opinions of the principal officers of the federal government  The president may grant reprieves and pardons  except in cases of impeachment  i e   the president cannot pardon himself or herself to escape impeachment by Congress   Section 2 grants and limits the president s appointment powers  The president may make treaties  with the advice and consent of the Senate  provided two thirds of the senators who are present agree  With the advice and consent of the Senate  the President may appoint ambassadors  other public ministers and consuls  judges of the Supreme Court  and all other officers of the United States whose appointments are not otherwise described in the Constitution  Congress may give the power to appoint lower officers to the President alone  to the courts  or to the heads of departments  The president may make any of these appointments during a congressional recess  Such a  recess appointment  expires at the end of the next session of Congress  Section 3 opens by describing the president s relations with Congress  The president reports on the state of the union  The president may convene either house  or both houses  of Congress  When the two houses of Congress cannot agree on the time of adjournment  the president may adjourn them to some future date  Section 3 adds  The president receives ambassadors  The president sees that the laws are faithfully executed  The president commissions all the offices of the federal government  Section 4 provides for removal of the president and other federal officers  The president is removed on impeachment for  and conviction of  treason  bribery  or other high crimes and misdemeanors  Judiciary Main article  Article Three of the United States Constitution See also  wikisource Constitution of the United States of America Article III U S  Capitol BuildingWashington  DC Old Supreme CourtU S  Capitol basement Article Three describes the court system  the judicial branch   including the Supreme Court  The article requires that there be one court called the Supreme Court  and sets the kinds of cases it takes as original jurisdiction  Congress can create lower courts and appeals process  Congress enacts law defining crimes and providing for punishment  Article Three also protects the right to trial by jury in all criminal cases  and defines the crime of treason  Judicial power  Article III  Section 1  is the authority to interpret and apply the law to a particular case contested by litigants  It connotes the power to punish  sentence  and direct future action to resolve conflicts  The Constitution provides an outline for the U S  judicial system  Congress in the Judiciary Act of 1789 began to fill in detail  Current operating authority is Title 28 of the U S  Code  24  As of the First Congress  the Supreme Court justices rode circuit to sit as panels to hear appeals from the district courts  c  In 1891  Congress enacted a new system  District courts would have original jurisdiction  Intermediate appellate courts with exclusive jurisdiction were made up of districts  These heard regional appeals before consideration on a national level at the Supreme Court  The Supreme Court holds discretionary jurisdiction  Cases are not admitted before the Supreme Court until it decides that the Constitutional issues apply nationally  24  To enforce its decisions  the Constitution grants federal courts both criminal contempt and civil contempt powers to coerce individuals  The court s summary punishment for contempt immediately overrides all other punishments applicable to the subject party  Other implied powers include injunctive relief and habeas corpus remedies  The Court may imprisonment for contumacy  bad faith litigation  and failure to obey a writ of mandamus  Judicial power includes that granted by Acts of Congress for rules of law and punishment  Judicial power also extends to areas not covered by statute  Generally  federal courts cannot interrupt state court proceedings  But in rare cases  the theory of justice as equity can be used to intervene  In equity  a court takes up a concern for fairness  It rules on not only the letter of the law  but what may bring about good and right between the parties  24  Arisings Clause  The Diversity  of Citizenship  Clause  Article III  Section 2  Clause 1  Citizens of different states are citizens of the United States  Cases arising under the laws of the United States and its treaties come under the jurisdiction of Federal courts  Cases under international maritime law and conflicting land grants of different states come under Federal courts  Cases between U S  citizens in different states  and cases between U S  citizens and foreign states and their citizens  come under Federal jurisdiction  The trials will be in the state where the crime was committed  24  Judicial review  Article III  Section 2  U S  courts have the power to rule legislative enactments or executive acts invalid on constitutional grounds  The Constitution is the supreme law of the land  Any court  state or federal  high or low  has the power to refuse to enforce any statute or executive order it deems repugnant to the U S  Constitution  Two conflicting federal laws are under  pendent  jurisdiction if one presents a strict constitutional issue  Federal court jurisdiction is rare when a state Legislature enacts something as under federal jurisdiction  d  To establish a federal system of national law  considerable effort goes into developing a spirit of comity between Federal government and states  By the doctrine of  Res Judicata   federal courts give  full faith and credit  to State Courts  e  The Supreme Court will decide Constitutional issues of state law only on a case by case basis  and only by strict Constitutional necessity  independent of state legislators motives  their policy outcomes or its national wisdom  f  Exceptions Clause  Article III  Section 2  Clause 2  The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in cases about Ambassadors and other public ministers and consuls  for all cases respecting foreign nation states  25  Standing  Article III  Section 2  Clause 2  This is the rule for Federal courts to take a case  Justiciability is the standing to sue  A case cannot be hypothetical or concerning a settled issue  In the U S  system  someone must have direct  real and substantial personal injury  The issue must be concrete and  ripe   that is  of broad enough concern in the Court s jurisdiction that a lower court  either Federal or state  does not geographically cover all the existing cases before law  Courts following these guidelines exercise judicial restraint  Those making an exception are said to be judicial activist  g  Treason  Article III  Section 3  This part of the Constitution strips Congress of the Parliamentary power of changing or modifying the law of treason by simple majority statute  It s not enough to merely think treasonously  there must be an overt act of making war or materially helping those at war with the United States  Accusations must be corroborated by at least two witnesses  Congress is a political body and political disagreements routinely encountered should never be considered as treason  This allows for nonviolent resistance to the government because opposition is not a life or death proposition  However  Congress does provide for other less subversive crimes and punishments such as conspiracy  h  Federal relationships The States Main article  Article Four of the United States Constitution See also  wikisource Constitution of the United States of America Article IV Article Four outlines the relation between the states and the relation between the federal government  In addition  it provides for such matters as admitting new states as well as border changes between the states  For instance  it requires states to give  full faith and credit  to the public acts  records  and court proceedings of the other states  Congress is permitted to regulate the manner in which proof of such acts  records  or proceedings may be admitted  The  privileges and immunities  clause prohibits state governments from discriminating against citizens of other states in favor of resident citizens  e g   having tougher penalties for residents of Ohio convicted of crimes within Michigan   It also establishes extradition between the states  as well as laying down a legal basis for freedom of movement and travel amongst the states  Today  this provision is sometimes taken for granted  especially by citizens who live near state borders  but in the days of the Articles of Confederation  crossing state lines was often a much more arduous and costly process  Article Four also provides for the creation and admission of new states  The Territorial Clause gives Congress the power to make rules for disposing of federal property and governing non state territories of the United States  Finally  the fourth section of Article Four requires the United States to guarantee to each state a republican form of government

as provisions to protect United States citizens  By 1968  the Court would hold that provisions of the Bill of Rights were  fundamental to the American scheme of justice   The Amendment in view by the Supreme Court was applicable to the states in their relationship to individual United States citizens in every state  29  Among the Bill of Rights  Doug Linder counts the First  Second  Fourth  and Sixth Amendment as fully incorporated into State governance  Most of the Fifth Amendment is incorporated  and a single provision of the Eighth  The Third Amendment is incorporated only in the U S  Second Circuit  the states of New York  Connecticut and New Hampshire  The Supreme Court has not determined the Constitutional issue is yet  ripe  for national application in every state  The Seventh Amendment is not incorporated  30  Twentieth Century Amendments use the prohibitive phrase   neither the United States nor any State  to comprehensively incorporate the Amendment into the States at

Article VI Article Six establishes the Constitution  and the laws and treaties of the United States made according to it  to be the supreme law of the land  and that  the judges in every state shall be bound thereby  any thing in the laws or constitutions of any state notwithstanding   It validates national debt created under the Articles of Confederation and requires that all federal and state legislators  officers  and judges take oaths or affirmations to support the Constitution  This means that the states  constitutions and laws should not conflict with the laws of the federal constitution and that in case of a conflict  state judges are legally bound to honor the federal laws and constitution over those of any state  Article Six also states  no religious Test shall ever be

United States of America Article VII Ratification clause  Article VII  Section 1  Article Seven details how to initiate the new government as proposed  The Constitution was transmitted to the Articles Congress  then after debate  forwarded to the states  States were to ratify the Constitution in state conventions specially convened for that purpose  The ratification conventions would arise directly from the people voting  and not by the forms of any existing State constitutions  31  The new national Constitution would not take effect until at least nine states ratified  It would replace the existing government under the Articles of Confederation only after three fourths of the existing states agreed to move together by special state elections for one time conventions  It would apply only to those states that ratified it  and it would be valid for all states joining after  24  The Articles Congress certified eleven ratification conventions had adopted the proposed Constitution for their states on September 13  1788  and in accordance with its resolution  the new Constitutional government began March 4  1789  32   See above Ratification and beginning   The Amendments Amendment of the state Constitutions at the time of the 1787 Constitutional Convention required only a majority vote in a sitting legislature of a state  as duly elected representatives of its sovereign people  The next session of a regularly elected assembly could do the same  This was not the  fundamental law  the founders such as James Madison had in mind  Nor did they want to perpetuate the paralysis of

proposals 2 3 majority  then to Senate  States later ratify 10 of 12  Senate passed 12 proposals 2 3 majority  then 3 4 States  Bill of Rights Changing the  fundamental law  is a two part process of three steps  amendments are proposed then they must be ratified by the states  An Amendment can be proposed one of two ways  Both ways have two steps  It can be proposed by Congress  and ratified by the states  Or on demand of two thirds of the state legislatures  Congress could call a constitutional convention to propose an amendment  then to be ratified by the states  To date  all amendments  whether ratified or not  have been proposed by a two thirds vote in each house of Congress  Over 10 000 constitutional amendments have been introduced in Congress since 1789  during the last several decades  between 100 and 200 have been offered in a typical congressional year  Most of these ideas never leave Congressional committee  and of those reported to the floor for a vote  far fewer get proposed by Congress to the states for ratification  j  In the first step  the proposed Amendment must find a national super majority of 67  in Congress  both House  people  and Senate  states   The second step requires a super super 75  majority of the states ratifying  representing a majority of the people in the states ratifying  Congress determines whether the state legislatures or special state conventions ratify the amendment  33  On attaining Constitutional ratification of the proposal by three fourths of the states  at that instant  the  fundamental law  for the United States of America is expressed in that Amendment  It is operative without any additional agency  Although the Founders considered alternatives  no signature is required from the President  Congress does not have to re enact  The Supreme Court does not have to deliberate  There is no delay from a panel of lawyers to re draft and re balance the entire Constitution incorporating the new wording  The Amendment  with the last required state ratifying  is the  supreme law of the land  Unlike amendments to most constitutions  amendments to the United States Constitution are appended to the body of the text without altering or removing what already exists  Newer text is given precedence  k  Subsequent printed editions of the Constitution may line through the superseded passages with a note referencing the Amendment  Notes often cite applicable Supreme Court rulings incorporating the new fundamental law into American jurisprudence  when the first precedent was given  and in what way the earlier provisions were found void  Over the last thirty years  there have been a few proposals for amendments in mainstream political debate  These include the Federal Marriage Amendment  the Balanced Budget Amendment  and the Flag Desecration Amendment  Another may be repeal of the 17th Amendment  restoring selection of U S  Senators to state legislatures  Successful Main article  List of amendments to the United States Constitution The Constitution has twenty seven amendments  The first ten  collectively known as the Bill of Rights  were ratified simultaneously by 1791  The next seventeen were ratified separately over the next two centuries   Bill of Rights  Main article  United States Bill of Rights The National Archives displays the Bill of Rights as one of the three  Charters of Freedom   The original intent of these first ten Amendments was to restrict Congress from abusing its power  For example  the First Amendment    Congress shall make no law  establishing a religion   was ratified by the states before all states had  of their own accord  disestablished their official churches  The Federalist Papers argued that amendments were not necessary to adopt the Constitution  But without the promise in their ratification conventions  Massachusetts  Virginia and New York could not have joined the Union as early as 1789  James Madison  true to his word  managed the proposed amendments through the new House of Representatives in its first session  The amendments that became the Bill of Rights were ten proposals of the twelve that Congress sent out to the states in 1789  l  Later in American history  applying the Bill of Rights directly to the states developed only with the Fourteenth Amendment  Wikisource has original text related to this article  United States Bill of Rights No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges     of citizens     nor     deprive any person of life  liberty  or property  without due process of law  nor deny     the equal protection of the laws  The legal mechanism that courts use today to extend the Bill of Rights against the abuses of state government is called  incorporation   The extent of its application is often at issue in modern jurisprudence  Generally  the Bill of Rights can be seen as the States addressing three major concerns  individual rights  federal courts and the national government s relationships with the States  Individual rights The first Amendment defines American political community  based on individual integrity and voluntary association  Congress cannot interfere with an individual s religion or speech  It cannot restrict a citizen s communication with others to form community by worship  publishing  gathering together or petitioning the government  The First Amendment addresses the rights of freedom of religion  prohibiting Congress from establishing a religion and protecting the right to free exercise of religion   freedom of speech  freedom of the press  freedom of assembly  and freedom of petition  Trial and sentencing Given their history of colonial government  most Americans wanted guarantees against the central government using the courts against state citizens  The Constitution already had individual protections such as strictly defined treason  no ex post facto law and guaranteed habeas corpus except during riot or rebellion  Now added protections came in five Amendments  United States Bill of Rights Currently housed in the National Archives  Protecting the accused  The Fourth Amendment guards against searches  arrests  and seizures of property without a specific warrant or a  probable cause  to believe a crime has been committed  Some rights to privacy have been found in this amendment and others by the Supreme Court  The Fifth Amendment forbids trial for a major crime except after indictment by a grand jury  prohibits double jeopardy  repeated trials   except in certain very limited circumstances  forbids punishment without due process of law  and provides that an accused person may not be compelled to testify against himself  this is also known as  Taking the Fifth  or  Pleading the Fifth    This is regarded as the  rights of the accused  amendment  otherwise known as the Miranda rights after the Supreme Court case  It also prohibits government from taking private property for public use without  just compensation   the basis of eminent domain in the United States  The Seventh Amendment assures trial by jury in civil cases  Restraining the judges  The Sixth Amendment guarantees a speedy public trial for criminal offenses  It requires trial by a jury  guarantees the right to legal counsel for the accused  and guarantees that the accused may require witnesses to attend the trial and testify in the presence of the accused  It also guarantees the accused a right to know the charges against him  The Sixth Amendment has several court cases associated with it  including Powell v  Alabama  United States v  Wong Kim Ark  Gideon v  Wainwright  and Crawford v  Washington  In 1966  the Supreme Court ruled that the fifth amendment prohibition on forced self incrimination and the sixth amendment clause on right to counsel were to be made known to all persons placed under arrest  and these clauses have become known as the Miranda rights  The Eighth Amendment forbids excessive bail or fines  and cruel and unusual punishment  Congress nor States In 1789  future Federal state relations were uncertain  To begin  the States in their militias were not about to be disarmed  And  if Congress wanted a standing army  Congress would have to pay for it  not  quarter  soldiers at state citizen expense  The people always have all their inalienable rights  even if they are not all listed in government documents  If Congress wanted more power  it would have to ask for it from the people in the states  And if the Constitution did not say something was for Congress to do  then the States have the power to do it without asking  Potential military coercion The Second Amendment guarantees the right of adult men to keep their own weapons apart from state run arsenals  m  Once the new Constitution began government  states petitioned Congress to propose amendments including militia protections  New Hampshire s proposal for amendment was   Congress shall never disarm any citizen unless such as are or have been in actual rebellion   New York proposed       a well regulated militia  including the body of the people capable of bearing arms  is the proper  natural and safe defense of a free State   n  Over time  this amendment has been confirmed by the courts to protect individual rights and used to overturn state legislation regulating hand guns  Applying the Second Amendment only to the Federal government  and not to the states  persisted for much of the nation s early history  It was sustained in United States v  Cruikshank  1876  to support disarming African Americans holding arms in self defense from Klansmen in Louisiana  The Supreme Court held  citizens must  look for their protection against any violation by their fellow citizens from the state  rather than the national  government   Federal protection of an individual interfering with the state s right to disarm any of its citizens came in Presser v  Illinois  1886   The Supreme Court ruled the citizens were members of the federal militia  as were  all citizens capable of bearing arms   A state cannot  disable the people from performing their duty to the General Government   The Court was harking back to the language establishing a federal militia in 1792  o  In 1939  the Supreme Court returned to a consideration of militia  In U S  v  Miller  the Court addressed the enforceability of the National Firearms Act of 1934 prohibiting a short barreled shotgun  Held in the days of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow  this ruling referenced units of well equipped  drilled militia  the Founders  trainbands   the modern military Reserves  p  It did not address the tradition of an unorganized militia  Twentieth century instances have been rare but Professor Stanford Levinson has observed consistency requires giving the Second Amendment the same dignity of the First  Fourth  Ninth and Tenth  q  Once again viewing federal relationships  the Supreme Court in McDonald v  Chicago  2010  determined that the right of an individual to  keep and bear arms  is protected by the Second Amendment  It is incorporated by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment  so it applies to the states  The Third Amendment prohibits the government from using private homes as quarters for soldiers during peacetime without the consent of the owners  The states had suffered during the Revolution following the British Crown confiscating their militia s arms stored in arsenals in places such as Concord  Massachusetts  and Williamsburg  Virginia  Patrick Henry had rhetorically asked  shall we be stronger   when we are totally disarmed  and when a British Guard shall be stationed in every house   34  The only existing case law directly regarding this amendment is a lower court decision in the case of Engblom v  Carey  35  However  it is also cited in the landmark case  Griswold v  Connecticut  in support of the Supreme Court s holding that the constitution protects the right to personal privacy  Constitutional relationships The Ninth Amendment declares that the listing of individual rights in the Constitution and Bill of Rights is not meant to be comprehensive  and that the other rights not specifically mentioned are retained by the people  The Tenth Amendment reserves to the states respectively  or to the people  any powers the Constitution did not delegate to the United States  nor prohibit the states from exercising  Subsequent Wikisource has original text related to this article  Additional amendments to the United States Constitution Amendments to the Constitution after the Bill of Rights cover many subjects  The majority of the seventeen later amendments stem from continued efforts to expand individual civil or political liberties  while a few are concerned with modifying the basic governmental structure drafted in Philadelphia in 1787  Although the United States Constitution has been amended 27 times  only 26 of the amendments are currently in effect because the twenty first amendment supersedes the eighteenth  Citizen rights Several of the amendments have more than one application  but five amendments have concerned citizen rights

Amendment  Permits states to prohibit the importation of alcoholic beverages  State legislatures  Occasionally in American history  the people have had to strip state legislatures of some few privileges due to widespread  persisting violations to individual rights  States must administer equal protection under the Constitution and the Bill of Rights  States must guarantee rights to all citizens of the United States as their own  State legislatures will not be trusted to elect U S  Senators  States must allow all men to vote  States must allow women to vote  States cannot tax a U S  citizen s right to vote  Under the Constitution  the U S  government was restricted from infringing on citizen rights  The Fourteenth Amendment  1868  in part  defines a set of guarantees for United States citizenship  prohibits states from abridging citizens  privileges or immunities and rights to due process and the equal protection of the law  Voting in the states has not always been so universal as it is today  not all men  not women not 18 year olds  In 1870  regardless of practice  most states had no legal racial bar to voting by African Americans  Asians or Native Americans  But the Fifteenth Amendment  1870  prohibits the federal government and the states from using a citizen s race  color  or previous status as a slave as a qualification for voting  Then all men could vote by law  In 1920  while most states allowed at least some women s suffrage  the Nineteenth Amendment  1920  prohibits the federal government and the states from forbidding any citizen to vote due to their gender  Then all women could vote by law  In 1971  states allowed voting at ages 21  20  19 and 18  The Twenty sixth Amendment  1971  prohibits the federal government and the states from forbidding any citizen of age 18 or greater to vote on account of their age  By 1913  several state legislatures allowed their selection of U S  Senator by direct popular vote  However  the Seventeenth Amendment  1913  converts all state elections for U S  senators to popular election  Some state legislatures restricted the right to vote among their citizens more than others  Although most states in 1964 did not restrict voting by the use of poll taxes  the Twenty fourth Amendment  1964  prohibits the federal government and the states from requiring the payment of a tax as a qualification for voting for federal officials  U S  citizens cannot be taxed to vote  Unratified See also  Amendments approved by Congress and awaiting ratification and Amendments approved by Congress that were not ratified Of the thirty three amendments that have been proposed by Congress  twenty seven have passed  Six have failed ratification by the required three quarters of the state legislatures  Two have passed their deadlines  Four are technically in the eyes of a Court  still pending before state lawmakers  see Coleman v  Miller   All but one are dead ends  One remaining The  Titles of Nobility Amendment   TONA   proposed by the 11th Congress on May 1  1810  would have ended the citizenship of any American accepting  any Title of Nobility or Honour  from any foreign power  Some maintain that the amendment was ratified by the legislatures of enough states  and that a conspiracy has suppressed it  but this has been thoroughly debunked  36  The proposed amendment addressed the same  republican  and nationalist concern evident in the original Constitution  Article I  Section 9  No officer of the United States   without the Consent of the Congress   shall  accept of any present  Emolument  Office  or Title  of any kind whatever  from any King  Prince or foreign State   The Constitutional provision is unenforceable because the offense is not subject to a penalty  Known to have been ratified by lawmakers in twelve states  the last in 1812  this amendment contains no expiration date for ratification and could still be ratified were the state legislatures to take it up  Abandoned Quit by practice The Congressional Apportionment Amendment  proposed by the 1st Congress on September 25  1789  defined a formula for how many members there would be in the United States House of Representatives after each decennial census  Ratified by eleven states  the last being Kentucky in June 1792 during Kentucky s initial month of statehood  this amendment contains no expiration date for ratification  In the abstract it may be procedurally ratified  As written  it became inapplicable when the population of the United States reached ten million  Allocation of seats for a state delegation is no longer increased or decreased by each change of 10 000 population  Since 1940  the number of Representatives in the U S  House has been fixed at 435  Decennial population counts are apportioned among the states in a formula by law  The Corwin Amendment  proposed by the 36th Congress on March 2  1861  would have forbidden any attempt to subsequently amend the Constitution to empower the federal government to  abolish or interfere  with the  domestic institutions  of the states  meaning slavery  It was ratified by only Ohio  Maryland and controversially  Illinois  before the outbreak of the Civil War  t  Lincoln took it under consideration in his First Inaugural as a means of preserving the Union  Four additional states seceded and war came  Before his assassination  Lincoln pushed the Thirteenth Amendment through Congress and out to the state legislatures to abolish slavery forever  u  Quit by policy Starting with the proposal of the 18th Amendment in 1917  each proposed amendment has included a deadline for passage in the text of the amendment  Five without a deadline became Amendments  v  One proposed amendment without a deadline has not been ratified  The Child Labor Amendment of 1924  A child labor amendment proposed by the 68th Congress on June 2  1924  It provides   The Congress shall have power to limit  regulate  and prohibit the labor of persons under eighteen years of age   This amendment is highly unlikely to be ratified  since subsequent federal child labor laws have uniformly been upheld as a valid exercise of Congress s powers under the Commerce Clause  Time ran out There are two amendments that were approved by Congress but were not ratified by enough states prior to the ratification deadline set by Congress  The Equal Rights Amendment  ERA   which reads in part  Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex   Proposed by the 92nd Congress on March 22  1972  it was ratified by the legislatures of 35 states  and expired on either March 22  1979 or on June 30  1982  following a controversial three year extension of the ratification deadline passed by the 95th Congress in 1978  Of the 35 states ratifying it  four later rescinded their ratifications before the extended ratification period  A fifth stipulated that its first approval would not extend with Federal law  Such reversals are controversial  no court has ruled on the question  During ratification of the 14th Amendment Ohio and New Jersey rescinded their earlier approvals  But their ratifications were counted towards three fourths of the states when the 14th Amendment was ultimately proclaimed part of the Constitution in 1868  The District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment was proposed by the 95th Congress on August 22  1978  Had this amendment been ratified  it would have granted to Washington  D C  two Senators and at least one member of the House of Representatives as though the District of Columbia were a state  Ratified by the legislatures of only 16 states  out of the required 38   the proposed amendment expired on August 22  1985  Judicial review See also  Judicial review in the United States  Judicial review  and Appellate review The way the Constitution is understood is influenced by court decisions  especially those of the Supreme Court  These decisions are referred to as precedents  Judicial review is the power of the Court to examine federal legislation  executive agency rules and state laws  to decide their constitutionality  and to strike them down if found unconstitutional  Judicial review includes the power of the Court to explain the meaning of the Constitution as it applies to particular cases  Over the years  Court decisions on issues ranging from governmental regulation of radio and television to the rights of the accused in criminal cases have changed the way many constitutional clauses are interpreted  without amendment to the actual text of the Constitution  Legislation passed to implement the Constitution  or to adapt those implementations to changing conditions  broadens and  in subtle ways  changes the meanings given to the words of the Constitution  Up to a point  the rules and regulations of the many federal executive agencies have a similar effect  If an action of Congress or the agencies is challenged  however  it is the court system that ultimately decides whether these actions are permissible under the Constitution  The Supreme Court has indicated that once the Constitution has been extended to an area  by Congress or the Courts   its coverage is irrevocable  To hold that the political branches may switch the Constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they  not this Court  say  what the law is    w  Scope and theory Courts established by the Constitution can regulate government under the Constitution  the supreme law of the land  First  they have jurisdiction over actions by an officer of government and state law  Second  Federal courts may rule on whether coordinate branches of national government conform to the Constitution  Until the Twentieth Century  the Supreme Court of the United States may have been the only high tribunal in the world to use a court for constitutional interpretation of fundamental law  others generally depending on their national legislature  37  Early Court roots in the founding John Jay  1789 1795 New York co authorFederalist Papers John Marshall  1801 1835Fauquier County delegate Virginia Ratification Convention The basic theory of American Judicial review is summarized by constitutional legal scholars and historians as follows  the written Constitution is fundamental law  It can change only by extraordinary legislative process of national proposal  then state ratification  The powers of all departments are limited to enumerated grants found in the Constitution  Courts are expected  a  to enforce provisions of the Constitution as the supreme law of the land  and  b  to refuse to enforce anything in conflict with it  38  In Convention  As to judicial review and the Congress  the first proposals by Madison  Va  and Wilson  Pa  called for a supreme court veto over national legislation  In this it resembled the system in New York  where the Constitution of 1777 called for a  Council of Revision  by the Governor and Justices of the state supreme court  The Council would review and in a way  veto any passed legislation violating the spirit of the Constitution before it went into effect  The nationalist s proposal in Convention was defeated three times  and replaced by a presidential veto with Congressional over ride  Judicial review relies on the jurisdictional authority in Article III  and the Supremacy Clause  39  The justification for judicial review is to be explicitly found in the open ratifications held in the states and reported in their newspapers  John Marshall in Virginia  James Wilson in Pennsylvania and Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut all argued for Supreme Court judicial review of acts of state legislature  In Federalist No  78  Alexander Hamilton advocated the doctrine of a written document held as a superior enactment of the people   A limited constitution can be preserved in practice no other way  than through courts which can declare void any legislation contrary to the Constitution  The preservation of the people s authority over legislatures rests  particularly with judges   40  x  The Supreme Court was initially made up of jurists who had been intimately connected with the framing of the Constitution and the establishment of its government as law  John Jay  NY   a co author of the Federalist Papers  served as Chief Justice for the first six years  The second Chief Justice for a term of four years  was Oliver Ellsworth  Ct   a delegate in the Constitutional Convention  as was John Rutledge  SC   Washington s recess appointment as Chief Justice who served in 1795  John Marshall  Va   the fourth Chief Justice  had served in the Virginia Ratification Convention in 1788  His service on the Court would extend 34 years over some of the most important rulings to help establish the nation the Constitution had begun  In the first years of the Supreme Court  members of the Constitutional Convention who would serve included James Wilson  Pa  for ten years  John Blair  Jr   Va  for five  and John Rutledge  SC  for one year as Justice  then Chief Justice in 1795  Establishment When John Marshall followed Oliver Ellsworth as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in 1801  the federal judiciary had been established by the Judiciary Act  but there were few cases  and less prestige   The fate of judicial review was in the hands of the Supreme Court itself   Review of state legislation and appeals from state supreme courts was understood  But the Court s life  jurisdiction over state legislation was limited  The Marshall Court s landmark Barron v  Baltimore held that the Bill of Rights restricted only the federal government  and not the states  40  In the landmark Marbury v  Madison case  the Supreme Court asserted its authority of judicial review over Acts of Congress  It finds were that Marbury and the others had a right to their commissions as judges in the District of Columbia  The law afforded Marbury a remedy at court  Then Marshall  writing the opinion for the majority  announced his discovered conflict between Section 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 and Article III  y  42  z  The United States government  as created by the Constitution is a limited government  and a statute contrary to it is not law  In this case  both the Constitution and the statutory law applied to the particulars at the same time   The very essence of judicial duty  according to Marshall was to determine which of the two conflicting rules should govern  The Constitution enumerates powers of the judiciary to extend to cases arising  under the Constitution   Courts were required to choose the Constitution over Congressional law  Further  justices take a Constitutional oath to uphold it as  Supreme law of the land   43   This argument has been ratified by time and by practice      aa  ab   Marshall The Supreme Court did not declare another Act of Congress unconstitutional until the disastrous Dred Scott decision in 1857  held after the voided Missouri Compromise statute  had already been repealed  In the eighty years following the Civil War to World War II  the Court voided Congressional statutes in 77 cases  on average almost one a year  45  Something of a crisis arose when  in 1935 and 1936  the Supreme Court handed down twelve decisions voiding Acts of Congress relating to the New Deal  President Franklin D  Roosevelt then responded with his abortive  court packing plan   Other proposals have suggested a Court super majority to overturn Congressional legislation  or a Constitutional Amendment to require that the Justices retire at a specified age by law  To date  the Supreme Court s power of judicial review has persisted  41  Self restraint The power of judicial review could not have been preserved long in a democracy unless it had been  wielded with a reasonable measure of judicial restraint  and with some attention  as Mr  Dooley said  to the election returns   Indeed  the Supreme Court has developed a system of doctrine and practice that self limits is power of judicial review  46  The Court controls almost all of its business by choosing what cases to consider  writs of certiorari  In this way it can avoid expressing an opinion if it sees an issue is currently embarrassing or difficult  The Supreme Court limits itself by defining for itself what is a  justiciable question   First  the Court is fairly consistent in refusing to make any  advisory opinions  in advance of actual cases  ac  Second   friendly suits  between those of the same legal interest are not considered  Third  the Court requires a  personal interest   not one generally held  and a legally protected right must be immediately threatened by government action  Cases are not taken up if the litigant has no standing to sue  Having the money to sue or being injured by government action alone are not enough  46  These three procedural ways of dismissing cases have led critics to charge that the Supreme Court delays decisions by unduly insisting on technicalities in their  standards of litigability   Under the Court s practice  there are cases left unconsidered which are in the public interest  with genuine controversy  and resulting from good faith action   The Supreme Court is not only a court of law but a court of justice   47  Separation of powers The Supreme Court balances several pressures to maintain its roles in national government  It seeks to be a co equal branch of government  but its decrees must be enforceable  The Court seeks to minimize situations where it asserts itself superior to either President or Congress  but Federal officers must be held accountable  The Supreme Court assumes power to declare acts of Congress as unconstitutional but it self limits its passing on constitutional questions  48  But the Court s guidance on basic problems of life and governance in a democracy is most effective when American political life reinforce its rulings  49  Justice Brandeis summarized four general guidelines that the Supreme Court uses to avoid constitutional decisions relating to Congress  ad  The Court will not anticipate a question of constitutional law nor decide open questions unless a case decision requires it  If it does  a rule of constitutional law is formulated only as the precise facts in the case require  The Court will choose statutes or general law for the basis of its decision if it can without constitutional grounds  If it does  the Court will choose a constitutional construction of an Act of Congress  even if its constitutionality is seriously in doubt   48  Likewise with the Executive Department  Edwin Corwin observed that the Court does sometimes rebuff presidential pretentions  but it more often tries to rationalize them  Against Congress  an Act is merely  disallowed   In the executive case  exercising judicial review produces  some change in the external world  beyond the ordinary judicial sphere  50  The  political question  doctrine especially applies to questions which present a difficult enforcement issue  Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes addressed the Court s limitation when political process allowed future policy change  but a judicial ruling would  attribute finality   Political questions lack  satisfactory criteria for a judicial determination   51  John Marshall recognized how the president holds  important political powers  which as Executive privilege allows great discretion  This doctrine was applied in Court rulings on President  Grant  s duty to enforce the law during Reconstruction  It extends to the sphere of foreign affairs  Justice Robert Jackson explained  Foreign affairs are inherently political   wholly confided by our Constitution to the political departments of the government      and  not subject to judicial intrusion or inquiry   52  Critics of the Court object in two principle ways to its self restraint in judicial review  deferring as it does as a matter of doctrine to Acts of Congress and Presidential actions   1  Its inaction is said to allow  a flood of legislative appropriations  which permanently create an imbalance between the states and federal government   2  Supreme Court deference to Congress and the executive compromises American protection of civil rights  political minority groups and aliens  53  Subsequent Courts Main article  History of the Supreme Court of the United States Supreme Courts under the leadership of subsequent Chief Justices have also used judicial review to interpret the Constitution among individuals  states and Federal branches  Notable contributions were made by the Chase Court  the Taft Court  the Warren Court  and the Rehnquist Court  Further information  List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Chase Court Salmon P  Chase was a Lincoln appointee  serving as Chief Justice from 1864 to 1873  His career encompassed service as a U S  Senator and Governor of Ohio  He has coined the slogan   Free soil  free Labor  free men   One of Lincoln s  team of rivals   he was appointed Secretary of Treasury during the Civil War  issuing  greenbacks   To appease radical Republicans  Lincoln appointed him to replace Chief Justice Roger B  Taney of Dred Scott case fame  In one of his first official acts  Chase admitted John Rock  the first African American to practice before the Supreme Court  The  Chase Court  is famous for Texas v  White which asserted a permanent Union of indestructible states  Veazie Banks v  Fenno upheld the Civil War tax on state banknotes  Hepburn v  Griswold found parts of the Legal Tender Acts unconstitutional  though it was reversed under a late Supreme Court majority  Further information  List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Taft Court Scope of judicial review expanded Salmon P  Chase  ae  Union  Reconstruction William H  Taft  af  commerce  incorporation Earl Warren  ag  due process  civil rights William Rehnquist  ah  federalism  privacy William Howard Taft was a Harding appointment to Chief Justice from 1921 to 1930  A Progressive Republican from Ohio  his earlier Republican career included Ohio Supreme Court  U S  Solicitor General  U S  Governor General of the Philippines  and Theodore Roosevelt s Secretary of War  He was a one term President  He sought non coercive foreign policies in  Dollar Diplomacy  and in his private foundation   League to Enforce Peace   In his presidential term  Taft s domestic agenda encompassed trust busting and strengthening the Instate Commerce Commission  As Chief Justice  he advocated the Judiciary Act of 1925 that brought the Federal District Courts under the administrative jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the newly united branch of government initiated its own separate building in use today  Taft successfully sought the expansion of Court jurisdiction over non  states such as District of Columbia and Territories of Arizona  New Mexico  Alaska and Hawaii  Later extensions added the Spanish American War acquisitions of the Commonwealth of the Philippines and Puerto Rico  In 1925  the Taft Court issued a ruling overturning a Marshall Court ruling on the Bill of Rights  In Gitlow v  New York  the Court established the doctrine of  incorporation which applied the Bill of Rights to the states  Important cases included the Board of Trade v  Olsen that upheld Congressional regulation of commerce  Olmstead v  U S  allowed exclusion of evidence obtained without a warrant based on application of the 14th Amendment proscription against unreasonable searches  Wisconsin v  Illinois ruled the equitable power of the United States can impose positive action on a state to prevent its inaction from damaging another state  Further information  List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Warren Court Earl Warren was an Eisenhower nominee  Chief Justice from 1943 to 1953  Warren s Republican career in the law reached from County Prosecutor  California state attorney general  and three consecutive terms as Governor  His programs stressed progressive efficiency  expanding state education  re integrating returning veterans  infrastructure and highway construction  In 1954  the Warren Court overturned a landmark Fuller Court ruling on the Fourteenth Amendment interpreting racial segregation as permissible in government and commerce providing  separate but equal  services  Warren built a coalition of Justices after 1962 that developed the idea of natural rights as guaranteed in the Constitution  Brown v  Board of Education banned segregation in public schools  Baker v  Carr and Reynolds v  Sims established Court ordered  one man one vote   Bill of Rights Amendments were incorporated into the states  Due process was expanded in Gideon v  Wainwright  and Miranda v  Arizona  First Amendment rights were addressed in Griswold v  Connecticut concerning privacy  and Engel v  Vitale relative to free speech  Further information  List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Rehnquist Court William Rehnquist was a Reagan appointment to Chief Justice  serving from 1986 to 2005  Following study at Stanford and Harvard  he clerked under Justice Robert H  Jackson  served as a legal adviser and writer for Barry Goldwater in his presidential campaign  and practiced law in Arizona before his Nixon appointment as Justice in 1971  As Chief Justice  Rehnquist was a team builder  In conference  no Justice spoke a second time until all had spoken  No Justice  including himself  was assigned to write a second holding for the Court until all had written one  When Rehnquist was in the minority  he deferred to the majority to choose the writer of the majority opinion  While he would concur with overthrowing a state supreme court s decision  as in Bush v  Gore  he built a coalition of Justices after 1994 that developed the idea of federalism as provided for in the Tenth Amendment  In the hands of the Supreme Court  the Constitution and its Amendments were to restrain Congress  as in City of Boerne v  Flores  Nevertheless  the Rehnquist Court was noted in the contemporary  culture wars  for overturning state laws relating to privacy prohibiting late term abortions in Stenberg v  Carhart  prohibiting sodomy in Lawrence v  Texas  or ruling so as to protect free speech in Texas v  Johnson or affirmative action in Grutter v  Bollinger  Civic religion Main article  American civil religion National Archives Rotundavirtual tour online 54  There is a viewpoint that some Americans have come to see the documents of the Constitution  along with the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights as being a cornerstone of a type of civil religion  This is suggested by the prominent display of the Constitution  along with the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights  in massive  bronze framed  bulletproof  moisture controlled glass containers vacuum sealed in a rotunda by day and in multi ton bomb proof vaults by night at the National Archives Building  55  The idea of displaying the documents strikes some academic critics looking from point of view of the 1776 or 1789 America as  idolatrous  and also curiously at odds with the values of the Revolution    56  By 1816 Jefferson wrote that   s ome men look at constitutions with sanctimonious reverence and deem them like the ark of the covenant  too sacred to be touched   But he saw imperfections and imagined that potentially  there could be others  believing as he did that  institutions must advance also   57  Samuel P  Huntington discusses common connections for most peoples in nation states  a national identity as product of common ethnicity  ancestors and experience  common language  culture and religion  The United States has a fate different from  most peoples   according to Huntington  since American identity is  willed affirmation  of what Huntington refers to as the American creed   a  individual rights  b  majority rule and  c  a constitutional order of limited government power  Whittle Johnson in The Yale Review sees a sort of  covenanting community  of freedom under law  which   transcending the  natural  bonds of race  religion and class  itself takes on transcendent importance   58  According to this argument  political ideals emphasize a sort of political orthodoxy which enable an ethnic diversity unequaled in Britain  France  Germany or Japan  59  Worldwide Jose Rizal Sun Yat sen Main article  United States Constitution and worldwide influence The United States Constitution has had a considerable influence worldwide on later constitutions  International leaders have followed it as a model within their own traditions  These leaders include Benito Juarez of Mexico  Jose Rizal of the Philippines and Sun Yat sen of China  Criticism Exception to the Constitution did not end at ratification  In every age

 Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom  1779  Notes   Opposition to ratification was led by Governor George Clinton  the opposition also suggested that New York reserve the right to withdraw if the Constitution were not amended  Madison led the first session of the first Congress to propose amendments  and ten of the twelve were made Constitutional    The discussion in Adler cites Lincoln s explication of the preamble that  common welfare  meant those things the people could not provide themselves  In 1830  Senator Haynes of South Carolina had made a speech for  Liberty first  and Union afterwards   Daniel Webster of Massachusetts made a  Reply to Haynes  speech for  Union and Liberty  now and forever  one and inseparable   20    The Judiciary Act of 1789 established 6 Supreme Court justices  The number was periodically increased until 10 in 1863  allowing Lincoln additional appointments  After the Civil War  vacancies reduced the number to 7  Congress finally fixed the number at 9    Judicial Review is explained in Hamilton s Federalist No  78  It also has roots in Natural Law expressions in the Declaration of Independence  The Supreme Court first ruled an act of Congress unconstitutional in Marbury v  Madison  the second was Dred Scott  24    For instance   collateral estoppel  directs that when a litigant wins in a state court  they cannot sue in federal court to get a more favorable outcome    Recently numerous habeas corpus reforms have tried to preserve a working  relationship of comity  and simultaneously streamline the process for state and lower courts to apply Supreme Court interpretations  24    The four concepts which determine  justiciability   the formula for a federal court taking and deciding a case  are the doctrines of  a  standing   b  real and substantial interests   c  adversity  and  d  avoidance of political questions  24    Contrary to this source when viewed  the Constitution provides that punishments  including forfeiture of income and property  must apply to the person convicted   No attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture  on the convicted traitor s children or heirs  This avoids the perpetuation of civil war into the generations by Parliamentary majorities as in the War of the Roses  24    An alternative method of proposing an Amendment consists of application to Congress by the super majority of two thirds of the state legislatures call for another constitutional convention  That convention s proposal then requires ratification by the same super super majority as the first method  three fourths of the states  While this has never been done  in the 1980s  32 of the necessary 34 states called for a convention to propose a  balanced budget amendment     As no convention has been called  it is unclear how one would work in practice    The new  supreme law of the land  takes the place of the old  For instance  the Thirteenth Amendment nullifies any permissive language relating to slavery in the original text of the Constitution  The Twenty first Amendment repealed the Eighteenth Amendment  Constitutionally  nothing prevents a future amendment from actually changing the older text    The second of the twelve proposed amendments  regarding the compensation of members of Congress  remained unratified until 1992  when the legislatures of enough states finally approved it  as a result  after pending for two centuries  it became the Twenty seventh Amendment  The first of the twelve  which is still technically pending before the state legislatures for ratification  pertains to the apportionment of the United States House of Representatives after each decennial census  The most recent state whose lawmakers are known to have ratified this proposal is Kentucky in 1792  during that Commonwealth s first month of statehood    Dispersing armaments in the face of superior force was a hard learned lesson  At the outbreak of hostilities in the American Revolution  Royal Governors captured arsenals of the colonial legislatures in Concord  Massachusetts  and Williamsburg  Virginia  for example    Three states adopted the Constitution in ratification conventions addressing the need for an amendment guaranteeing state militia and citizen right to bear arms  Four states petitioned for protection of militia and the right to bear arms  New York  Rhode Island  Virginia and North Carolina  Pennsylvania and Massachusetts proposals included it as minority reports  34    In Presser v  Illinois  An armed mob of 400 in the city of Chicago paraded through the streets without a permit to intimidate an immigrant neighborhood  Illinois argued the armed individuals violated the state military code  34    Without a demonstrated relationship between  a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length  and  a well regulated militia   the Court could not say the Second Amendment guaranteed carrying it in public  The Court did not see it as  any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense  of the United States    Moncure does not address any parallels between the 1930s of Al Capone and modern day drug cartels  nor any use of gun regulation by local law enforcement  state National Guard  or the armed forces for policing borders and homeland security  34    Governor William Tuck of Virginia used the unorganized militia to break a 1946 strike by employees of the Virginia Electric and Power Company  34    DC residents constitutionally vote for President by the Amendment  The vote for a non voting delegate in Congress  and local offices as Congress allows by law    Since the 1964 presidential election  the Electoral College has equaled 538  the sum of 100 Senators  435 Representatives  and 3 for DC  Were DC to have been made a state  its allotted representation in Congress would have been one  Since the 1960s  both major political parties nominating presidential candidates make provision for proportionate representation in their national conventions for DC and the U S  Territories as though they were states  Except for DC  no Constitutional provision has been made for them in the Electoral College  For example  the U S  citizens of Puerto Rico would have 7 Electoral College votes  that is  two count for senators  five for its proportion in the House over the last three censuses  As it is  they have one non voting delegate in the House who can cast a vote in committees of direct concern to Puerto Rico    Illinois lawmakers   sitting as a state constitutional convention at the time   approved the unratified amendment  but that action is of questionable validity  The proposed amendment contains no expiration date for ratification and a Court held it could not stop state legislatures from debating it    The fundamental change in American society and its ethos  adoption of the 13th  14th  and 15th Amendments after the Civil War  and 140 years of Federal and state jurisprudence makes an adoption restoring African slavery unlikely    Amendments after the 18th Amendment which did not have deadlines and became Constitutional were  a  the 19th Amendment

 Bidwell  182 U S  244  261  1901   commenting on an earlier Supreme Court decision  Loughborough v  Blake  18 U S   5 Wheat   317  1820   Rasmussen v  United States  197 U S  516  529 530  536  1905  concurring opinions of Justices Harlan and Brown   that once the Constitution has been extended to an area  its coverage is irrevocable  Boumediene v  Bush   That where the Constitution has been once formally extended by Congress to territories  neither Congress nor the territorial legislature can enact laws inconsistent therewith  The Constitution grants Congress and the President the power to acquire  dispose of  and govern territory  not the power to decide when and where its terms apply    The Supreme Court found 658 cases of invalid state statutes from 1790 1941 before the advent of Civil Rights cases in the last half of the Twentieth Century 41    In this  John Marshall leaned on the argument of Hamilton in Federalist No  78    Although it may be that the true meaning of the Constitution to the people of the United States in 1788 can only be divined by a study of the state ratification conventions  the Supreme Court has used the Federalist Papers as a supplemental guide to the Constitution since their co author  John Jay  was the first Chief Justice    The entire quote reads   This argument has been ratified by time and by practice  and there is little point in quibbling with it  Of course  the President also takes an oath to support the Constitution   44    The presidential reference is to Andrew Jackson s disagreement with Marshall s Court over Worcester v  Georgia  finding Georgia could not impose its laws in Cherokee Territory  Jackson replied   John Marshall has made his decision  now let him enforce it    and the Trail of Tears proceeded  Jackson would not politically interpose the U S  Army between Georgia and the Cherokee people as Eisenhower would do between Arkansas and the integrating students     Advisory opinions  are not the same as  declaratory judgments    a  These address rights and legal relationships in cases of  actual controversy   and  b  the holding has the force and effect of a final judgment   c  There is no coercive
