 wair  5  is a U S  state located on the Atlantic Coast in the Mid Atlantic region of the United States  It is bordered to the south and west by Maryland  to the northeast by New Jersey  and to the north by Pennsylvania  6  The state takes its name from Thomas West  3rd Baron De La Warr  an English nobleman and Virginia s first colonial governor  after whom what is now called Cape Henlopen was originally named  7  Delaware is located in the northeastern portion of the Delmarva Peninsula and is the second least extensive  the sixth least populous  but the sixth most densely populated of the 50 United States  Delaware is divided into three counties  From north to south  these three counties are New Castle  Kent  and Sussex  While the southern two counties have historically been predominantly agricultural  New Castle County has been more industrialized  The state ranks second in civilian scientists and engineers as a percentage of the workforce and number of patents issued to companies or individuals per 1 000 workers  citation needed  The history of the state s economic and industrial development is closely tied to the impact of the Du Pont family  founders and scions of E  I  du Pont de Nemours and Company  one of the world s largest chemical companies  8  Before its coastline was first explored by Europeans in the 16th century  Delaware was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans  including the Lenape in the north and Nanticoke in the south  It was initially colonized by Dutch traders at Zwaanendael  located near the present town of Lewes  in 1631  9  Delaware was one of the 13 colonies participating in the American Revolution and on December 7  1787  became the first state to ratify the Constitution of the United States  thereby becoming known as The First State  Contents 1 Geography 1 1 Topography 1 2 Climate 1 3 Environment 1 4 Environmental management 2 History 2 1 Native Americans 2 2 Colonial Delaware 2 3 American Revolution 2 4 Slavery

Delaware The Twelve Mile Circle Diagram of the Twelve Mile Circle  the Mason Dixon Line and  The Wedge   All blue and white areas are inside Delaware  except for the small sliver of Maryland on the western extremity of the circle  Delaware is 96 miles  154 km  long and ranges from 9 miles  14 km  to 35 miles  56 km  across  totaling 1 954 square miles  5 060 km2   making it the second smallest state in the United States after Rhode Island  Delaware is bounded to the north by Pennsylvania  to the east by the Delaware River  Delaware Bay  New Jersey and the Atlantic Ocean  and to the west and south by Maryland  Small portions of Delaware are also situated on the eastern side of the Delaware River sharing land boundaries with New Jersey  The state of Delaware  together with the Eastern Shore counties of Maryland and two counties of Virginia  form the Delmarva Peninsula  which stretches down the Mid Atlantic Coast  The definition of the northern boundary of the state is unusual  Most of the boundary between Delaware and Pennsylvania was originally defined by an arc extending 12 miles  19 3 km  from the cupola of the courthouse in the city of New Castle  This boundary is often referred to as the Twelve Mile Circle  10  This is the only nominally circular state boundary in the United States  This border extends all the way east to the low tide mark on the New Jersey shore  then continues south along the shoreline until it again reaches the 12 mile  19 km  arc in the south  then the boundary continues in a more conventional way in the middle of the main channel  thalweg  of the Delaware River  To the west  a portion of the arc extends past the easternmost edge of Maryland  The remaining western border runs slightly east of due south from its intersection with the arc  The Wedge of land between the northwest part of the arc and the Maryland border was claimed by both Delaware and Pennsylvania until 1921  when Delaware s claim was confirmed   edit  Topography Delaware is on a level plain  with the lowest mean elevation of any state in the nation  2  Its highest elevation  located at Ebright Azimuth  near Concord High School  does not rise fully 450 feet  140 m  above sea level  2  The northernmost part of the state is part of the Appalachian Piedmont with hills and rolling surfaces  The fall line approximately follows the Robert Kirkwood Highway between Newark and Wilmington  south of this road is the Atlantic Coastal Plain with flat  sandy  and  in some parts  swampy ground  A ridge about 75 to 80 feet  23 to 24 m  in elevation extends along the western boundary of the state and separates between the watersheds that feed Delaware River and Bay to the east and the Chesapeake Bay to the west   edit  Climate Since almost all of Delaware is a part of the Atlantic Coastal Plain  the effects of the ocean moderate its climate  The state is in a transitional zone between a humid subtropical climate and a continental climate  Despite its small size  roughly 100 miles  160 km  from its northernmost to southernmost points   there is significant variation in mean temperature and amount of snowfall between Sussex County and New Castle County  The southern portion of the state has a somewhat milder climate and a longer growing season than the northern portion of the state  Delaware s all time record high of 110  F  43  C  was recorded at Millsboro on July 21  1930  the all time record low of  17  F   27  C  was also recorded at Millsboro on January 17  1893   edit  Environment The transitional climate of Delaware supports a wide variety of vegetation  In the northern third of the state are found Northeastern coastal forests and mixed oak forests typical of the northeastern United States  11  In the southern two thirds of the state are found Middle Atlantic coastal forests  11 Trap Pond State Park in Sussex County  for example  supports what may be one of the northernmost stands of bald cypress   edit  Environmental management Delaware provides government subsidy support for the clean up of property  lightly contaminated  by hazardous waste  the proceeds for which come from a tax on wholesale petroleum sales  12   edit  History Main article  History of Delaware  edit  Native Americans Before Delaware was settled by European colonists  the area was home to the Eastern Algonquian tribes known as the Unami Lenape or Delaware throughout the Delaware valley  and the Nanticoke along the rivers leading into the Chesapeake Bay  The Unami Lenape in the Delaware Valley were closely related to Munsee Lenape tribes along the Hudson River  They had a settled hunting and agricultural society  and they rapidly became middlemen in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their ancient enemy  the Minqua or Susquehannock  With the loss of their lands on the Delaware River and the destruction of the Minqua by the Iroquois of the Five Nations in the 1670s  the remnants of the Lenape who wished to remain identified as such left the region and moved over the Alleghany Mountains by the mid 18th century  Generally  those who did not relocate out of the State of Delaware were baptized  became Christian and were grouped together with other persons of color in official records and in the minds of their non Native American neighbors   edit  Colonial Delaware New Sweden   encounter between Swedish colonists and the natives of Delaware  The Dutch were the first Europeans to settle in present day Delaware in the Middle region by establishing a trading post at Zwaanendael  near the site of Lewes in 1631  Within a year all the settlers were killed in a dispute with area Indian tribes  In 1638 New Sweden  a Swedish trading post and colony  was established at Fort Christina  now in Wilmington  by Peter Minuit at the head of a group of Swedes  Finns and Dutch  The colony of New Sweden lasted for 17 years  In 1651  the Dutch  reinvigorated by the leadership of Peter Stuyvesant  established a fort at present day New Castle  and in 1655 they conquered the New Sweden colony  annexing it into the Dutch New Netherland  13  14  Only nine years later  in 1664  the Dutch were conquered by a fleet of English ships by Sir Robert Carr under the direction of James  the Duke of York  Fighting off a prior claim by Cecilius Calvert  2nd Baron Baltimore  Proprietor of Maryland  the Duke passed his somewhat dubious ownership on to William Penn in 1682  Penn strongly desired access to the sea for his Pennsylvania province and leased what then came to be known as the  Lower Counties on the Delaware   13  from the Duke  Penn established representative government and briefly combined his two possessions under one General Assembly in 1682  However  by 1704 the Province of Pennsylvania had grown so large that their representatives wanted to make decisions without the assent of the Lower Counties and the two groups of representatives began meeting on their own  one at Philadelphia  and the other at New Castle  Penn and his heirs remained proprietors of both and always appointed the same person Governor for their Province of Pennsylvania and their territory of the Lower Counties  The fact that Delaware and Pennsylvania shared the same governor was not unique  From 1703 1738  New York and New Jersey shared a governor  15 Massachusetts and New Hampshire also shared a governor for some time  16  Dependent in early years on indentured labor  Delaware imported more slaves as the number of English immigrants decreased with better economic conditions in England  The colony became a slave society and cultivated tobacco as a cash crop  although English immigrants continued to arrive   edit  American Revolution Like the other middle colonies  the Lower Counties on the Delaware initially showed little enthusiasm for a break with Britain  The citizenry had a good relationship with the Proprietary government  and generally were allowed more independence of action in their Colonial Assembly than in other colonies  Merchants at the port of Wilmington had trading ties with the British  So it was that New Castle lawyer Thomas McKean denounced the Stamp Act in the strongest terms  and Kent County native John Dickinson became the  Penman of the Revolution   Anticipating the Declaration of Independence  Patriot leaders Thomas McKean and Caesar Rodney convinced the Colonial Assembly to declare itself separated from British and Pennsylvania rule on June 15  1776  The person best representing Delaware s majority  George Read  could not bring himself to vote for a Declaration of Independence  Only the dramatic overnight ride of Caesar Rodney gave the delegation the votes needed to cast Delaware s vote for independence  Initially led by John Haslet  Delaware provided one of the premier regiments in the Continental Army  known as the  Delaware Blues  and nicknamed the  Blue Hen Chickens   In August 1777  General Sir William Howe led a British army through Delaware on his way to a victory at the Battle of Brandywine and capture of the city of Philadelphia  The only real engagement on Delaware soil was the Battle of Cooch s Bridge  fought on September 3  1777  at Cooch s Bridge in New Castle County  Following the Battle of Brandywine  Wilmington was occupied by the British  and State President John McKinly was taken prisoner  The British remained in control of the Delaware River for much of the rest of the war  disrupting commerce and providing encouragement to an active Loyalist portion of the population  particularly in Sussex County  Because the British promised slaves of rebels freedom for fighting with them  escaped slaves flocked north to join their lines  17  Following the American Revolution  statesmen from Delaware were among the leading proponents of a strong central United States with equal representation for each state   edit  Slavery and race Many colonial settlers came to Delaware from Maryland and Virginia  which had been experiencing a population boom  The economies of these colonies were chiefly based on tobacco culture and were increasingly dependent on slave labor for its intensive cultivation  Most of the English colonists arrived as indentured servants  hiring themselves out as laborers for a fixed period to pay for their passage  In the early years the line between indentured servants and African slaves or laborers was fluid  Most of the free African American families in Delaware before the Revolution had migrated from Maryland to find more affordable land  They were descendants chiefly of relationships or marriages between servant women and enslaved  servant or free African or African American men  18  As the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in England  more slaves were imported for labor  At the end of the colonial period  the number of enslaved people in Delaware began to decline  Shifts in the agriculture economy from tobacco to mixed farming created less need for slaves  labor  Local Methodists and Quakers encouraged slaveholders to free their slaves following the American Revolution  and many did so in a surge of individual manumissions for idealistic reasons  By 1810 three quarters of all blacks in Delaware were free  When John Dickinson freed his slaves in 1777  he was Delaware s largest slave owner with 37 slaves  By 1860 the largest slaveholder owned only 16 slaves  19  Although attempts to abolish slavery failed by narrow margins in the legislature  in practical terms  the state had mostly ended the practice  By the 1860 census on the verge of the Civil War  91 7 percent of the black population  or nearly 20 000 people  were free  20  21  The independent black denomination was chartered by freed slave Peter Spencer in 1813 as the  Union Church of Africans   This followed the 1793 establishment of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Philadelphia  which had ties to the Methodist Episcopal Church until 1816  Spencer built a church in Wilmington for the new denomination  22  This was renamed the African Union First Colored Methodist Protestant Church and Connection  more commonly known as the A U M P  Church  Begun by Spencer in 1814  the annual gathering of the Big August Quarterly still draws people together in a religious and cultural festival  the oldest such cultural festival in the nation  At the onset of the Civil War  Delaware was only nominally a slave state  and it remained in the Union  Delaware voted against secession on January 3  1861  As the governor said  Delaware had been the first state to embrace the Union by ratifying the Constitution and would be the last to leave it  While most Delaware citizens who fought in the war served in the regiments of the state  some served in companies on the Confederate side in Maryland and Virginia Regiments  Delaware is notable for being the only slave state from which no Confederate regiments or militia groups were assembled  It freed the remaining 1 000 or so Delaware slaves with the ratification of the 13th Amendment to the US Constitution in December 1865   edit  Demographics Delaware Population Density

edit  Incorporation in Delaware Over 50  of U S  publicly traded corporations and 60  of the Fortune 500 companies are incorporated in Delaware  38  the state s attractiveness as a corporate haven is largely because of its business friendly corporation law  Franchise taxes on Delaware corporations supply about one fifth of its state revenue  39  Although Delaware is ranked first tax haven in the world by Tax Justice Network  40  it is not listed on the OECD s 2009  Black List   despite objections of Luxembourg s and Switzerland s authorities  41   edit  Food and drink Title 4  chapter 7 of

enforcing blue laws and banned sale of liquor on Sunday  43   edit  Transportation The current state license plate design was introduced in 1959  making it the longest running license plate design in United States history  44  The transportation system in Delaware is under the governance and supervision of the Delaware Department of Transportation  also known as  DelDOT   45  46  Funding for DelDOT projects is drawn  in part  from the Delaware Transportation Trust Fund  established in 1987 to help stabilize transportation funding  the availability of the Trust led to a gradual separation of DelDOT operations from other Delaware state operations  47  DelDOT manages programs such as a Delaware Adopt a Highway program  major road route snow removal  traffic control infrastructure  signs

of transportation maintenance responsibility  the remaining public road miles are under the supervision of individual municipalities  The  DART First State  public transportation system was named  Most Outstanding Public Transportation System  in 2003 by the American Public Transportation Association  Coverage of the system is broad within northern New Castle County with close association to major highways in Kent and Sussex counties  The system includes bus  subsidized passenger rail operated by Philadelphia transit agency SEPTA  and subsidized taxi and paratransit modes  The paratransit system  consisting of a state wide door to door bus service for the elderly and disabled  has been described by a Delaware state report as  the most generous paratransit system in the United States   47  As of 2012 update   fees for the paratransit service have not changed since 1988  47   edit  Roads Further information  List of numbered routes in Delaware Delaware Route 1  a partial toll road

there are six U S  highways that serve Delaware  U S  Route 9  U S  Route 13  U S  Route 40  U S  Route 113  U S  Route 202  and U S  Route 301  There are also several state highways that cross the state of Delaware  a few of them include Delaware Route 1  Delaware Route 9  and Delaware Route 404  U S  13 and DE Rt 1 are primary north south highways connecting Wilmington and Pennsylvania with Maryland  with DE 1 serving as the main route between Wilmington and the Delaware beaches  DE Rt  9 is a north south highway connecting Dover and Wilmington via a scenic route along the Delaware Bay  U S  40  is a primary east west route  connecting Maryland with New Jersey  DE Rt  404 is another primary east west highway connecting the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in Maryland with the Delaware beaches  The state also operates two toll highways  the Delaware Turnpike  which is Interstate 95  between Maryland and New Castle and the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway  which is DE Rt  1  between Wilmington and Dover  A bicycle route  Delaware Bicycle Route 1  spans the north south length of the state from the Maryland border in Fenwick Island to the Pennsylvania border north of Montchanin  It is the first of several signed bike routes planned in Delaware  48  Delaware has around 1 450 bridges  ninety five percent of which are under the supervision of DelDOT  About 30 percent of all Delaware bridges were built prior to 1950 and about 60 percent of the number are included in the National Bridge Inventory  Some bridges not under DelDOT supervision includes the four bridges on the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal  which are under the jurisdiction of the U S  Army Corps of Engineers  and the Delaware Memorial Bridge  which is under the bi state Delaware River and Bay Authority  It has been noted that the tar and chip composition of secondary roads in Sussex County make them more prone to deterioration than asphalt roadways found in the rest of the state  49  Among these roads  Sussex  county road  238 is among the most problematic  49   edit  Ferries There are three ferries that operate in the state of Delaware  Cape May Lewes Ferry crosses the mouth of the Delaware Bay between Lewes  Delaware and Cape May  New Jersey  Woodland Ferry is a cable ferry that crosses the Nanticoke River southwest of Seaford  Three Forts Ferry Crossing connects Delaware City with Fort Delaware and Fort Mott in New Jersey  edit  Rail and bus A Norfolk Southern locomotive in Dover  Amtrak has two stations in Delaware along the Northeast Corridor  the relatively quiet Newark Rail Station in Newark  and the busier Wilmington Rail Station in Wilmington  The Northeast Corridor is also served by SEPTA s Wilmington Newark Line of Regional Rail  which serves Claymont  Wilmington  Churchmans Crossing  and Newark  The major freight railroad in Delaware is the Class I railroad Norfolk Southern  which provides service to most of Delaware  It connects with two shortline railroads  the Delaware Coast Line Railroad and the Maryland and Delaware Railroad  which serve local customers in Sussex County  Another Class I railroad  CSX  passes through northern New Castle County parallel to the Amtrak Northeast Corridor  CSX connects with the freight heritage operation  the Wilmington and Western Railroad  based in Wilmington and the East Penn Railroad  which operates a line from Wilmington to Coatesville  Pennsylvania   edit  Air See also  Aviation in Delaware Delaware is the only state in the United States without commercial air service  New Castle Airport near Wilmington has been served by commercial airlines in the past  the last being Skybus Airlines  which provided service to Columbus  Ohio and Greensboro  North Carolina from March 7  2008 50  until its bankruptcy on April 5  2008  Delaware is centrally situated in the Northeast Corridor region of cities along I 95  Therefore  Delaware commercial airline passengers most frequently use Philadelphia International Airport  PHL  and Baltimore Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport  BWI  for domestic and international transit  Residents of Sussex County will also use Wicomico Regional Airport  as it is located less than 10 miles  16 km  from the Delaware border  Newark Liberty International Airport  EWR  and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport  DCA  are also within a 100 mile  160 km  radius of New Castle County  The large Dover Air Force Base of the USAF Air Mobility Command is located in the central part of the state  and it is the home of the 436th Airlift Wing and the 512th

corporate disputes  many relating to mergers and acquisitions  The Court of Chancery and the Supreme Court have developed a worldwide reputation for rendering concise opinions concerning corporate law which generally  but not always  grant broad discretion to corporate boards of directors and officers  In addition  the Delaware General Corporation Law  which forms the basis of the Courts  opinions  is widely regarded as giving great flexibility to corporations to manage their affairs  For these reasons  Delaware is considered to have the most business friendly legal system in the United States  therefore a great number of companies are incorporated in Delaware  including 60  of the companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange  51  Delaware was the last US state to use judicial corporal punishment  in 1952  52   edit  Executive branch See also  List of Governors of Delaware The executive branch is headed by the Governor of Delaware  The present governor is Jack A  Markell  Democrat

Counties Delaware is subdivided into three counties  from north to south they are New Castle  Kent County and Sussex  This is the fewest among all states  with Rhode Island having five counties  Each county elects its own legislative body  known in New Castle and Sussex counties as County Council  and in Kent County as Levy Court   which deal primarily in zoning and development issues  Most functions which are handled on a county by county basis in other states   such as court and law enforcement   have been centralized in Delaware  leading to a significant concentration of power in the Delaware state government  The counties were historically divided into hundreds  which were used as tax reporting and voting districts until the 1960s  but now serve no administrative role  their only current official legal use being in real estate title descriptions  54   edit  Politics See also  United States presidential election in Delaware  2004 and Political party strength in Delaware

presidential election  the state tended to be a Presidential bellwether  sending its three electoral votes to the winning candidate since 1952  This trend ended in 2000 and continued in 2004  when the state voted for the losing Democratic presidential candidate  in the 2000 election Delaware s electoral votes went to Al Gore and in 2004  John Kerry won Delaware by eight percentage points  In 2008  Democrat Barack Obama defeated Republican John McCain in Delaware 62 63  to 37 37   Obama s running mate was Joe Biden  who had represented Delaware in the United States Senate since 1973  Delaware s swing to the Democrats is in part due to a strong Democratic trend in New Castle County  home to 55 percent of Delaware s population more the population of Kent and Sussex counties combined  the two smaller counties have only 359 000 people between them to New Castle s 535 000   New Castle has not gone Republican in a presidential election since 1988  In 1992  2000 and 2004  the Republican presidential candidate carried both Kent and Sussex but lost by double digits each time in New Castle  which was a large enough margin to swing the state to the Democrats  New Castle also elects a substantial majority of the legislature  27 of the 41 state house districts and 14 of the 21 state senate districts are based in New Castle  The Democrats have held the governorship since 1993  having won the last four gubernatorial elections in a row  Democrats presently hold eight of the nine statewide elected offices  while the Republicans hold only one statewide office  State Auditor   edit
