is an island country located in the southwestern Pacific Ocean  The country geographically comprises two main landmasses   that of the North and South Islands   as well as numerous smaller islands  New Zealand is situated some 1 500 kilometres  900 mi  east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly 1 000 kilometres  600 mi  south of the Pacific island nations of New Caledonia  Fiji  and Tonga  Because of its remoteness  it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans  During its long isolation  New Zealand developed a distinctive biodiversity of both animal and plant life  Most notable are the large number of unique bird species  many of which became extinct after the arrival of humans and introduced mammals  With a mild maritime climate  the land was mostly covered in forest  The country s varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions caused by the Pacific and Indo Australian Plates clashing beneath the earth s surface  Polynesians settled New Zealand in 1250 1300 CE and developed a distinctive M ori culture  and Europeans first made contact in 1642 CE  The introduction of potatoes and muskets triggered upheaval among M ori early during the 19th century  which led to the inter tribal Musket Wars  In 1840 the British and M ori signed a treaty making New Zealand a colony of the British Empire  Immigrant numbers increased sharply and conflicts escalated into the New Zealand Wars  which resulted in much M ori land being confiscated in the mid North Island  Economic depressions were followed by periods of political reform  with women gaining the vote during the 1890s  and a welfare state being established from the 1930s  After World War II  New Zealand joined Australia and the United States in the ANZUS security treaty  although the United States later  until 2010  suspended the treaty after New Zealand banned nuclear weapons  New Zealand is part of the intelligence sharing among the Anglosphere countries  the UKUSA Agreement  New Zealanders enjoyed one of the highest standards of living in the world in the 1950s  but the 1970s saw a deep recession  worsened by oil shocks and the United Kingdom s entry into the European Economic Community  The country underwent major economic changes during the 1980s  which transformed it from a protectionist to a liberalised free trade economy  Markets for New Zealand s agricultural exports have diversified greatly since the 1970s  with once dominant exports of wool being overtaken by dairy products  meat  and recently wine  The majority of New Zealand s population is of European descent  the indigenous M ori are the largest minority  followed by Asians and non M ori Polynesians  M ori and New Zealand Sign Language are the official languages  with English predominant  Much of New Zealand s culture is derived from M ori and early British settlers  Early European art was dominated by landscapes and to a lesser extent portraits of M ori  A recent resurgence of M ori culture has seen their traditional arts of carving  weaving and tattooing become more mainstream  Many artists now combine M ori and Western techniques to create unique art forms  The country s culture has also been broadened by globalisation and increased immigration from the Pacific Islands and Asia  New Zealand s diverse landscape provides many opportunities for outdoor pursuits and has provided the backdrop for a number of big budget movies  New Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes  these have less autonomy than the country s long defunct provinces did  Nationally  executive political power is exercised by the Cabinet  led by the Prime Minister  Queen Elizabeth II is the country s head of state and is represented by a Governor General  The Queen s Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau  a dependent territory   the Cook Islands and Niue  self governing but in free association   and the Ross Dependency  New Zealand s territorial claim in Antarctica  New Zealand is a member of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation  Commonwealth of Nations  Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development  Pacific Islands Forum  and the United Nations  Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 3 Politics 3 1 Government 3 2 Foreign relations and the military 3

names Detail from a 1657 map showing the western coastline of  Nova Zeelandia  Aotearoa  often translated as  land of the long white cloud   11  is the current M ori name for New Zealand  and is also used in New Zealand English  It is unknown whether M ori had a name for the whole country before the arrival of Europeans  with Aotearoa originally referring to just the North Island  12 Abel Tasman sighted New Zealand in 1642 and called it Staten Landt  supposing it was connected to a landmass of the same name at the southern tip of South America  13  In 1645 Dutch cartographers renamed the land Nova Zeelandia after the Dutch province of Zeeland  14  15  British explorer James Cook subsequently anglicised the name to New Zealand  n 8  M ori had several traditional names for the two main islands  including Te Ika a M ui  the fish of M ui  for the North Island and Te Wai Pounamu  the waters of greenstone  or Te Waka o Aoraki  the canoe of Aoraki  for the South Island  16  Early European maps labelled the islands North  North Island   Middle  South Island  and South  Stewart Island   Rakiura   17  In 1830 maps began to use North and South to distinguish the two largest islands and by 1907 this was the accepted norm  18  The New Zealand Geographic Board discovered in 2009 that the names of the North Island and South Island had never been formalised  but there are now plans to do so  19  The board is also considering suitable M ori names  20  with Te Ika a M ui and Te Wai Pounamu the most likely choices according to the chairman of the M ori Language Commission  21  History Main article  History of New Zealand The M ori people are most likely descended from people that emigrated from Taiwan to Melanesia and then travelled east through to the Society Islands  After a pause of 70 265 years a new wave of exploration led to the discovery and settlement of New Zealand  22  New Zealand was one of the last major landmasses settled by humans  Radiocarbon dating  evidence of deforestation 23  and mitochondrial DNA variability within M ori populations 24  suggest New Zealand was first settled by Eastern Polynesians between 1250 and 1300  16  25  concluding a long series of voyages through the southern Pacific islands  26  Over the centuries that followed these settlers developed a distinct culture now known as M ori  The population was divided into iwi  tribes  and hap   subtribes  which would cooperate  compete and sometimes fight with each other  At some point a group of M ori migrated to the Chatham Islands  which they named R kohu  where they developed their distinct Moriori culture  27  28  The Moriori population was decimated between 1835 and 1862  largely because of M ori invasion and enslavement  although European diseases also contributed  In 1862 only 101 survived and the last known full blooded Moriori died in 1933  29  The first Europeans known to have reached New Zealand were Dutch explorer Abel Tasman and his crew in 1642  30  In a hostile encounter  four crew members were killed and at least one M ori was hit by canister shot  31  Europeans did not revisit New Zealand until 1769 when British explorer James Cook mapped almost the entire coastline  30  Following Cook  New Zealand was visited by numerous European and North American whaling  sealing and trading ships  They traded food  metal tools  weapons and other goods for timber  food  artefacts  water  and on occasion sex  32  The introduction of the potato and the musket transformed M ori agriculture and warfare  Potatoes provided a reliable food surplus  which enabled longer and more sustained military campaigns  33  The resulting inter tribal Musket Wars encompassed over 600 battles between 1801 and 1840  killing 30 000 40 000 M ori  34  From the early 19th century  Christian missionaries began to settle New Zealand  eventually converting most of the M ori population  35  The M ori population declined to around 40 percent of its pre contact level during the 19th century  introduced diseases were the major factor  36  The Waitangi sheet from the Treaty of Waitangi The British Government appointed James Busby as British Resident to New Zealand in 1832 37  and in 1835  following an announcement of impending French settlement by Charles de Thierry  the nebulous United Tribes of New Zealand sent a Declaration of the Independence to King William IV of the United Kingdom asking for protection  37  Ongoing unrest and the dubious legal standing of the Declaration of Independence prompted the Colonial Office to send Captain William Hobson to claim sovereignty for the British Crown and negotiate a treaty with the M ori  38  The Treaty of Waitangi was first signed in the Bay of Islands on 6 February 1840  39  In response to the commercially run New Zealand Company s attempts to establish an independent settlement in Wellington 40  and French settlers  purchasing  land in Akaroa  41  Hobson declared British sovereignty over all of New Zealand on 21 May 1840  even though copies of the Treaty were still circulating  42  With the signing of the Treaty and declaration of sovereignty the number of immigrants  particularly from the United Kingdom  began to increase  43  New Zealand  originally part of the colony of New South Wales  became a separate Crown colony in 1841  44  The colony gained a representative government in 1852 and the 1st New Zealand Parliament met in 1854  45  In 1856 the colony effectively became self governing  gaining responsibility over all domestic matters other than native policy   Control over native policy was granted in the mid 1860s   45  Following concerns that the South Island might form a separate colony  premier Alfred Domett moved a resolution to transfer the capital from Auckland to a locality near the Cook Strait  46  Wellington was chosen for its harbour and central location  with parliament officially sitting there for the first time in 1865  As immigrant numbers increased  conflicts over land led to the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s and 1870s  resulting in the loss and confiscation of much M ori land  47  In 1893 the country became the first nation in the world to grant all women the right to vote 48  and in 1894 pioneered the adoption of compulsory arbitration between employers and unions  49  In 1907 New Zealand declared itself a Dominion within the British Empire and in 1947 the country adopted the Statute of Westminster  making New Zealand a Commonwealth realm  45  New Zealand was involved in world affairs  fighting alongside the British Empire in the first and second World Wars 50  and suffering through the Great Depression  51  The depression led to the election of the first Labour government and the establishment of a comprehensive welfare state and a protectionist economy  52  New Zealand experienced increasing prosperity following World War II 53  and M ori began to leave their traditional rural life and move to the cities in search of work  54  A M ori protest movement developed  which criticised Eurocentrism and worked for greater recognition of M ori culture and the Treaty of Waitangi  55  In 1975  a Waitangi Tribunal was set up to investigate alleged breaches of the Treaty  and it was enabled to investigate historic grievances in 1985  39  The government has negotiated settlements of these grievances with many iwi  although M ori claims to the foreshore and seabed have proved controversial in the 2000s  Politics Main article  Politics of New Zealand John Key  Prime Minister of New Zealand since 2008 Government Main article  Government of New Zealand New Zealand is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy  56  although its constitution is not codified  57 Queen Elizabeth II is the Queen of New Zealand and the head of state  58  The Queen is represented by the Governor General  59  whom she appoints on the advice of the Prime Minister  60  The Governor General can exercise the Crown s prerogative powers  such as reviewing cases of injustice and making appointments of Cabinet ministers  ambassadors and other key public officials  61  and in rare situations  the reserve powers  the power to dismiss a Prime Minister  dissolve Parliament or refuse the Royal Assent of a bill into law   62  The powers of the Queen and the Governor General are limited by constitutional constraints and they cannot normally be exercised without the advice of Cabinet  62  63  Elizabeth II Sir Jerry Mateparae The Queen of New Zealand and her representative  the Governor General The Parliament of New Zealand holds legislative power and consists of the Sovereign  represented by the Governor General  and the House of Representatives  63  It also included an upper house  the Legislative Council  until this was abolished in 1950  63  The supremacy of the House over the Sovereign was established in England by the Bill of Rights 1689 and has been ratified as law in New Zealand  63  The House of Representatives is democratically elected and a Government is formed from the party or coalition with the majority of seats  63  If no majority is formed a minority government can be formed if support from other parties during confidence and supply votes is assured  The Governor General appoints ministers under advice from the Prime Minister  who is by convention the Parliamentary leader of the governing party or coalition  64  Cabinet  formed by ministers and led by the Prime Minister  is the highest policy making body in government and responsible for deciding significant government actions  65  By convention  members of cabinet are bound by collective responsibility to decisions made by cabinet  66  Judges and judicial officers are appointed non politically and under strict rules regarding tenure to help maintain constitutional independence from the government  57  This theoretically allows the judiciary to interpret the law based solely on the legislation enacted by Parliament without other influences on their decisions  67  The Privy Council in London was the country s final court of appeal until 2004  when it was replaced with the newly established Supreme Court of New Zealand  The judiciary  headed by the Chief Justice  68  includes the Court of Appeal  the High Court  and subordinate courts  57  New Zealand government  Beehive  and the Parliament Buildings  right   in Wellington Almost all parliamentary general elections between 1853 and 1996 were held under the first past the post voting system  69  The elections since 1930 have been dominated by two political parties  National and Labour  69  Since 1996  a form of proportional representation called Mixed Member Proportional  MMP  has been used  57  Under the MMP system each person has two votes  one is for the seventy electoral seats  including seven reserved for M ori   70  and the other is for a party  The remaining fifty seats are assigned so that representation in parliament reflects the party vote  although a party has to win one electoral seat or 5 percent of the total party vote before it is eligible for these seats  71  Between March 2005 and August 2006 New Zealand became the only country in the world in which all the highest offices in the land  Head of State  Governor General  Prime Minister  Speaker and Chief Justice  were occupied simultaneously by women  72  Foreign relations and the military Main articles  Foreign relations of New Zealand and New Zealand Defence Force Early colonial New Zealand allowed the British Government to determine external trade and be responsible for foreign policy  73  The 1923 and 1926 Imperial Conferences decided that New Zealand should be allowed to negotiate their own political treaties  with the first successful commercial treaty being with Japan in 1928  Despite this independence New Zealand readily followed Britain in declaring war on Germany on 3 September 1939 with then Prime Minister Michael Savage proclaiming   Where she goes  we go  where she stands  we stand   74  M ori Battalion haka in Egypt  1941 In 1951 the United Kingdom became increasingly focused on its European interests  75  while New Zealand joined Australia and the United States in the ANZUS security treaty  76  The influence of the United States on New Zealand weakened following protests over the Vietnam War  77  the refusal of the United States to admonish France after the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior  78  disagreements over environmental and agricultural trade issues and New Zealand s nuclear free policy  79  80  Despite the USA s suspension of ANZUS obligations the treaty remained in effect between New Zealand and Australia  whose foreign policy has followed a similar historical trend  81  Close political contact is maintained between the two countries  with free trade agreements and travel arrangements that allow citizens to visit  live and work in both countries without restrictions  82  Currently over 500 000 New Zealanders live in Australia and 65 000 Australians live in New Zealand  82  New Zealand has a strong presence among the Pacific Island countries  A large proportion of New Zealand s aid goes to these countries and many Pacific people migrate to New Zealand for employment  83  Permanent migration is regulated under the 1970 Samoan Quota Scheme and the 2002 Pacific Access Category  which allow up to 1 100 Samoan nationals and up to 750 other Pacific Islanders respectively to become permanent New Zealand residents each year  A seasonal workers scheme for temporary migration was introduced in 2007 and in 2009 about 8 000 Pacific Islanders were employed under it  84  New Zealand is involved in the Pacific Islands Forum  Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum  including the East Asia Summit   82  New Zealand is also a member of the United Nations  85  the Commonwealth of Nations  86  the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development 87  and the Five Powers Defence Arrangements  88  Infantry from the 2nd Battalion  Auckland Regiment in the Battle of the Somme  September 1916  The New Zealand Defence Force has three branches  the Royal New Zealand Navy  the New Zealand Army and the Royal New Zealand Air Force  89  New Zealand s national defence needs are modest because of the unlikelihood of direct attack  90  although it does have a global presence  The country fought in both world wars  with notable campaigns in Gallipoli  Crete  91 El Alamein 92  and Cassino  93  The Gallipoli campaign played an important part in fostering New Zealand s national identity 94  95  and strengthened the ANZAC tradition it shares with Australia  96  According to Mary Edmond Paul   World War I had left scars on New Zealand society  with nearly 18 500 in total dying as a result of the war  more than 41 000 wounded  and others affected emotionally  out of an overseas fighting force of about 103 000 and a population of just over a million   97  New Zealand also played key parts in the naval Battle of the River Plate 98  and the Battle of Britain air campaign  99  100  During World War II  the United States had more than 400 000 American military personnel stationed in New Zealand  101  In addition to Vietnam and the two world wars  New Zealand fought in the Korean War  the Second Boer War  102  the Malayan Emergency  103  the Gulf War and the Afghanistan War  It has contributed forces to several regional and global peacekeeping missions  such as those in Cyprus  Somalia  Bosnia and Herzegovina  the Sinai  Angola  Cambodia  the Iran Iraq border  Bougainville  East Timor  and the Solomon Islands  104  New Zealand also sent a unit of army engineers to help rebuild Iraqi infrastructure for one year during the Iraq War  Local government and external territories Main articles  Local government in New Zealand and Realm of New Zealand Realm of New Zealand The early European settlers divided New Zealand into provinces  which had a degree of autonomy  105  Because of financial pressures and the desire to consolidate railways  education  land sales and other policies  government was centralised and the provinces were abolished in 1876  106  As a result  New Zealand now has no separately represented subnational entities  The provinces are remembered in regional public holidays 107  and sporting rivalries  108  Since 1876  various councils have administered local areas under legislation determined by the central government  105  109  In 1989  the government reorganised local government into the current two tier structure of regional councils and territorial authorities  110  The 249 municipalities 110  that existed in 1975 have now been consolidated into 67 territorial authorities and 11 regional councils  111  The regional councils  role is to regulate  the natural environment with particular emphasis on resource management   110  while territorial authorities are responsible for sewage  water  local roads  building consents and other local matters  112  Five of the territorial councils are unitary authorities and also act as regional councils  113  The territorial authorities consist of 13 city councils  53 district councils  and the Chatham Islands Council  While officially the Chatham Islands Council is not a unitary authority  it undertakes many functions of a regional council  114  The Realm of New Zealand is one of 16 realms within the commonwealth 115  116  and comprises New Zealand  Tokelau  the Ross Dependency  the Cook Islands and Niue  116  The Cook Islands and Niue are self governing states in free association with New Zealand  117  118  The New Zealand Parliament cannot pass legislation for these countries  but with their consent can act on behalf of them in foreign affairs and defence  Tokelau is a non self governing territory that uses the New Zealand flag and anthem  but is administered by a council of three elders  one from each Tokelauan atoll   119  120  The Ross Dependency is New Zealand s territorial claim in Antarctica  where it operates the Scott Base research facility  121  New Zealand citizenship law treats all parts of the realm equally  so most people born in New Zealand  the Cook Islands  Niue  Tokelau and the Ross Dependency before 2006 are New

Southern Alps dominate the South Island  while the North Island s Northland Peninsula stretches towards the subtropics  New Zealand is made up of two main islands and a number of smaller islands  located near the centre of the water hemisphere  The main North and South Islands are separated by the Cook Strait  22 kilometres  14 mi  wide at its narrowest point  123  Besides the North and South Islands  the five largest inhabited islands are Stewart Island  the Chatham Islands  Great Barrier Island  in the Hauraki Gulf   124 d Urville Island  in the Marlborough Sounds  125  and Waiheke Island  about 22 km  14 mi  from central Auckland   126  The country s islands lie between latitudes 29  and 53 S  and longitudes 165  and 176 E  New Zealand is long  over 1 600 kilometres  990 mi  along its north north east axis  and narrow  a maximum width of 400 kilometres  250 mi    127  with approximately 15 134 km  9 404 mi  of coastline 128  and a total land area of 268 021 square kilometres  103 483 sq mi  129  Because of its far flung outlying islands and long coastline  the country has extensive marine resources  Its Exclusive Economic Zone  one of the largest in the world  covers more than 15 times its land area  130  The South Island is the largest land mass of New Zealand  and is divided along its length by the Southern Alps  131  There are 18 peaks over 3 000 metres  9 800 ft   the highest of which is Aoraki Mount Cook at 3 754 metres  12 316 ft   132 Fiordland s steep mountains and deep fiords record the extensive ice age glaciation of this south western corner of the South Island  133  The North Island is less mountainous but is marked by volcanism  134  The highly active Taupo volcanic zone has formed a large volcanic plateau  punctuated by the North Island s highest mountain  Mount Ruapehu  2 797 metres  9 177 ft    The plateau also hosts the country s largest lake  Lake Taupo  135  nestled in the caldera of one of the world s most active supervolcanoes  136  Abel Tasman National Park in the South Island The country owes its varied topography  and perhaps even its emergence above the waves  to the dynamic boundary it straddles between the Pacific and Indo Australian Plates  137  New Zealand is part of Zealandia  a microcontinent nearly half the size of Australia that gradually submerged after breaking away from the Gondwanan supercontinent  138  About 25 million years ago  a shift in plate tectonic movements began to contort and crumple the region  This is now most evident in the Southern Alps  formed by compression of the crust beside the Alpine Fault  Elsewhere the plate boundary involves the subduction of one plate under the other  producing the Puysegur Trench to the south  the Hikurangi Trench east of the North Island  and the Kermadec and Tonga Trenches 139  further north  137  Climate Main article  Climate of New Zealand New Zealand has a mild and temperate maritime climate with mean annual temperatures ranging from 10  C  50  F  in the south to 16  C  61  F  in the north  140  Historical maxima and minima are 42 4  C  108 3  F  in Rangiora  Canterbury and  25 6  C   14 08  F  in Ranfurly  Otago  141  Conditions vary sharply across regions from extremely wet on the West Coast of the South Island to almost semi arid in Central Otago and the Mackenzie Basin of inland Canterbury and subtropical in Northland  142  Of the seven largest cities  Christchurch is the driest  receiving on average only 640 millimetres  25 in  of rain per year and Auckland the wettest  receiving almost twice that amount  143  Auckland  Wellington and Christchurch all receive a yearly average in excess of 2 000 hours of sunshine  The southern and south western parts of the South Island have a cooler and cloudier climate  with around 1 400 1 600 hours  the northern and north eastern parts of the South Island are the sunniest areas of the country and receive approximately 2 400 2 500 hours  144  Biodiversity Main article  Biodiversity of New Zealand The endemic flightless kiwi is a national icon  New Zealand s geographic isolation for 80 million years 145  and island biogeography is responsible for the country s unique species of flora and fauna  They have either evolved from Gondwanan wildlife or the few organisms that have managed to reach the shores flying  swimming or being carried across the sea  146  About 82 percent of New Zealand s indigenous vascular plants n 9  are endemic  covering 1 944 species across 65 genera and includes a single family  147  149  The two main types of forest are those dominated by broadleaf trees with emergent podocarps  or by southern beech in cooler climates  150  The remaining vegetation types consist of grasslands  the majority of which are tussock  151  Before the arrival of humans an estimated 80 percent of the land was covered in forest  with only high alpine  wet  infertile and volcanic areas without trees  152  Massive deforestation occurred after humans arrived  with around half the forest cover lost to fire after Polynesian settlement  153  Much of the remaining forest fell after European settlement  being logged or cleared to make room for pastoral farming  leaving forest occupying only 23 percent of the land  154  The forests were dominated by birds  and the lack of mammalian predators led to some like the kiwi  kakapo and takah  evolving flightlessness  155  The arrival of humans  associated changes to habitat  and the introduction of rats  ferrets and other mammals led to the extinction of many bird species  including large birds like the moa and Haast s eagle  156  157  Other indigenous animals are represented by reptiles  tuataras  skinks and geckos   158 frogs  spiders  katipo   insects  weta  and snails  159  160  Some  such as the wrens and tuatara  are so unique that they have been called living fossils  Three species of bats  one since extinct  were the only sign of native land mammals in New Zealand until the 2006 discovery of bones from a unique  mouse sized land mammal at least 16 million years old  161  162  Marine mammals however are abundant  with almost half the world s cetaceans  whales  dolphins  and porpoises  and large numbers of fur seals reported in New Zealand waters  163  Many seabirds breed in New Zealand  a third of them unique to the country  164  More penguin species are found in New Zealand than in any other country  165  Since human arrival almost half of the country s vertebrate species have become extinct  including at least fifty one birds  three frogs  three

published by The Heritage Foundation  175  Milford Sound  one of New Zealand s most famous tourist destinations 176  Historically  extractive industries have contributed strongly to New Zealand s economy  focussing at different times on sealing  whaling  flax  gold  kauri gum  and native timber  177  With the development of refrigerated shipping in the 1880s meat and dairy products were exported to Britain  a trade which provided the basis for strong economic growth in New Zealand  178  High demand for agricultural products from the United Kingdom and the United States helped New Zealanders achieve higher living standards than both Australia and Western Europe in the 1950s and 1960s  179  In 1973 New Zealand s export market was reduced when the United Kingdom joined the European Community 180  and other compounding factors  such as the 1973 oil and 1979 energy crisis  led to a severe economic depression  181  Living standards in New Zealand fell behind those of Australia and Western Europe  and by 1982 New Zealand had the lowest per capita income of all the developed nations surveyed by the World Bank  182  Since 1984  successive governments engaged in major macroeconomic restructuring  known first as Rogernomics and then Ruthanasia   rapidly transforming New Zealand from a highly protectionist economy to a liberalised free trade economy  183  184  Unemployment peaked above 10 percent in 1991 and 1992  185  following the 1987 share market crash  but eventually fell a record low of 3 4 percent in 2007  ranking fifth from twenty seven comparable OECD nations   186  The global financial crisis that followed however had a major impact on New Zealand with the GDP shrinking for five consecutive quarters  the longest recession in over thirty years  187  188  and unemployment rising back to 7  in late 2009  189  The unemployment rate for youth was 17 4  in the June 2011 quarter  190  New Zealand has experienced a series of  brain drains  since the 1970s 191  that still continue today  192  Nearly one quarter of highly skilled workers live overseas  most in Australia and Britain  the most from any developed nation  193  In recent years  however  a  brain gain  has brought in educated professionals from Europe and lesser developed countries  194  195  Trade New Zealand is heavily dependent on international trade  196  particularly in agricultural products  197  Exports account for a high 24 percent of its output  128  making New Zealand vulnerable to international commodity prices and global economic slowdowns  Its principal export industries are agriculture  horticulture  fishing  forestry and mining  which make up about half of the country s exports  198  Its major export partners are Australia  United States  Japan  China  and the United Kingdom  128  On 7 April 2008  New Zealand and China signed the New Zealand China Free Trade Agreement  the first such agreement China has signed with a developed country  199  200  The service sector is the largest sector in the economy  followed by manufacturing and construction and then farming and raw material extraction  128 Tourism plays a significant role in New Zealand s economy  contributing  15 0 billion to New Zealand s total GDP and supporting 9 6 percent of the total workforce in 2010  201  International visitors to New Zealand increased by 3 1 percent in the year to October 2010 202  and are expected to increase at a rate of 2 5 percent annually up to 2015  201  Wool has historically been one of New Zealand s major exports  Wool was New Zealand s major agricultural export during the late 19th century  177  Even as late as the 1960s it made up over a third of all export revenues  177  but since then its price has steadily dropped relative to other commodities 203  and wool is no longer profitable for many farmers  204  In contrast dairy farming increased  with the number of dairy cows doubling between 1990 and 2007  205  to become New Zealand s largest export earner  206  In the year to June 2009  dairy products accounted for 21 percent   9 1 billion  of total merchandise exports  207  and the country s largest company  Fonterra  controls almost one third of the international dairy trade  208  Other agricultural exports in 2009 were meat 13 2 percent  wool 6 3 percent  fruit 3 5 percent and fishing 3 3 percent  New Zealand s wine industry has followed a similar trend to dairy  the number of vineyards doubling over the same period  209  overtaking wool exports for the first time in 2007  210  211  Infrastructure In 2008  oil  gas and coal generated approximately 69 percent of New Zealand s gross energy supply and 31  was generated from renewable energy  primarily hydroelectric power and geothermal power  212 New Zealand s transport network includes 93 805 kilometres  58 288 mi  of roads  worth 23 billion dollars  213  and 4 128 kilometres  2 565 mi  of railway lines  214  Most major cities and towns are linked by bus services  although the private car is the predominant mode of transport  215  The railways were privatised in 1993  then re purchased by the government in 2004 and vested into a state owned enterprise  216  Railways run the length of the country  although most lines now carry freight rather than passengers  217  Most international visitors arrive via air 218  and New Zealand has seven international airports  although currently update  only the Auckland and Christchurch airports connect directly with countries other than Australia or Fiji  219  The New Zealand Post Office had a monopoly over telecommunications until 1989 when Telecom New Zealand was formed  initially as a state owned enterprise and then privatised in 1990  220  Telecom still owns the majority of the telecommunications infrastructure  but competition from other providers has increased  221  Demography Main article  Demographics of New Zealand New Zealand s historical population  black  and projected growth  red  The population of New Zealand is approximately 4 4 million  222  New Zealand is a predominantly urban country  with 72 percent of the population living in 16 main urban areas and 53 percent living in the four largest cities of Auckland  Christchurch  Wellington  and Hamilton  223  New Zealand cities generally rank highly on international livability measures  For instance  in 2010 Auckland was ranked the world s 4th most liveable city and Wellington the 12th by the Mercer Quality of Life Survey 224  The life expectancy of a New Zealand child born in 2008 was 82 4 years for females  and 78 4 years for males  225  Life expectancy at birth is forecast to increase from 80 years to 85 years in 2050 and infant mortality is expected to decline  226  In 2050 the population is forecast to reach 5 3 million  the median age to rise from 36 years to 43 years and the percentage of people 60 years of age and older to rise from 18 percent to 29 percent  226  Ethnicity and immigration Main articles  New Zealanders and Immigration to New Zealand In the 2006 census  67 6 percent identified ethnically as European and 14 6 percent as M ori  227  Other major ethnic groups include Asian  9 2 percent  and Pacific peoples  6 9 percent   while 11 1 percent identified themselves simply as a  New Zealander   or similar  and 1 percent identified with other ethnicities  228  n 11  This contrasts with 1961  when the census reported that the population of New Zealand was 92 percent European and 7 percent M ori  with Asian and Pacific minorities sharing the remaining 1 percent  230  While the demonym for a New Zealand citizen is New Zealander  the informal  Kiwi  is commonly used both internationally 231  and by locals  232  The M ori loanword P keh  usually refers to New Zealanders of European descent  although some reject this appellation  233  234  and some M ori use it to refer to all non Polynesian New Zealanders  235  New Zealand s fastest growing ethnic groups are Asian  Here  lion dancers perform at the Auckland Lantern Festival  The M ori were the first people to reach New Zealand  followed by the early European settlers  Following colonisation  immigrants were predominantly from Britain  Ireland and Australia because of restrictive policies similar to the white Australian policies  236  There was also significant Dutch  Dalmatian  237  Italian  and German immigration together with indirect European immigration through Australia  North America  South America and South Africa  238  Following the Great Depression policies were relaxed and migrant diversity increased  In 2009 10  an annual target of 45 000 50 000 permanent residence approvals was set by the New Zealand Immigration Service more than one new migrant for every 100 New Zealand residents  239  Twenty three percent of New Zealand s population were born overseas  most of whom live in the Auckland region  240  While most have still come from the United Kingdom and Ireland  29 percent   immigration from East Asia  mostly mainland China  but with substantial numbers also from Korea  Taiwan  Japan  and Hong Kong  is rapidly increasing the number of people from those countries  241  The number of fee paying international students increased sharply in the late 1990s  with more than 20 000 studying in public tertiary institutions in 2002  242  Language English is the predominant language in New Zealand  spoken by 98 percent of the population  3 New Zealand English is similar to Australian English and many speakers from the Northern Hemisphere are unable to tell the accents apart  243   The most prominent differences between the New Zealand English dialect and other English dialects are the shifts in the short front vowels  the short  i  sound  as in  kit   has centralised towards the schwa sound  the  a  in  comma  and  about    the short  e  sound  as in  dress   has moved towards the short  i  sound  and the short  a  sound  as in  trap   has moved to the short  e  sound  244  Hence  the New Zealand pronunciation of words such as  bad    dead    fish  and  chips  sound like  bed    did    fush  and  chups  to non New Zealanders  After the Second World War  M ori were discouraged from speaking their own language  te reo M ori  in schools and workplaces and it existed as a community language only in a few remote areas  245  It has recently undergone a process of revitalisation  246  247  being declared one of New Zealand s official languages in 1987  248  and is spoken by 4 1 percent of the population  3  There are now M ori language immersion schools and two M ori Television channels  the only nationwide television channels to have the majority of their prime time content delivered in M ori  249 Many places have officially been given dual Maori and English names in recent years  Samoan is one of the most widely spoken languages in New Zealand  2 3 percent   n 12  followed by French  Hindi  Yue and Northern Chinese  3  250  n 13 New Zealand Sign Language is used by approximately 28 000 people and was made New Zealand s second official language in 2006  251  A Ratana church Education and religion Main articles  Education in New Zealand and Religion in New Zealand Primary and secondary schooling is compulsory for children aged 6 to 16  with the majority attending from the age of 5  252  There are 13 school years and attending public schools is free  New Zealand has an adult literacy rate of 99 percent  128  and over half of the population aged 15 to 29 hold a tertiary qualification  252  n 14  There are five types of government owned tertiary institutions  universities  colleges of education  polytechnics  specialist colleges  and w nanga  253  and also private training establishments  254  In the adult population 14 2 percent have a bachelor s degree or higher  30 4 percent have some form of secondary qualification as their highest qualification and 22 4 percent have no formal qualification  255  Christianity is the predominant religion in New Zealand  In the 2006 Census  55 6 percent of the population identified themselves as Christians  while another 34 7 percent indicated that they had no religion  up from 29 6 percent in 2001  and around 4 percent affiliated with other religions  256  n 15  The main Christian denominations are Anglicanism  Roman Catholicism  Presbyterianism and Methodism  There are also significant numbers of Christians who identify themselves with Pentecostal  Baptist  and Latter day Saint churches and the New Zealand based Ratana church has adherents among M ori  According to census figures  other significant minority religions include Hinduism  Buddhism  and Islam  250  257  List of cities in New Zealand June 2010 population

house post depicting the navigator Kupe fighting two sea creatures Early M ori adapted the tropically based east Polynesian culture in line with the challenges associated with a larger and more diverse environment  eventually developing their own distinctive culture  Social organisation was largely communal with families  whanau   sub tribes  hapu  and tribes  iwi  ruled by a chief  rangatira  whose position was subject to the community s approval  259  The British and Irish immigrants brought aspects of their own culture to New Zealand and also influenced M ori culture  260  261  particularly with the introduction of Christianity  262  However  M ori still regard their allegiance to tribal groups as a vital part of their identity  and M ori kinship roles resemble those of other Polynesian peoples  263  More recently American  Australian  Asian and other European cultures have exerted influence on New Zealand  Non M ori Polynesian cultures are also apparent  with Pasifika  the world s largest Polynesian festival  now an annual event in Auckland  Cook Islands dancers at Auckland s Pasifika festival The largely rural life in early New Zealand led to the image of New Zealanders being rugged  industrious problem solvers  264  Modesty was expected and enforced through the  tall poppy syndrome   where high achievers received harsh criticism  265  At the time New Zealand was not known as an intellectual country  266  From the early 20th century until the late 1960s M ori culture was suppressed by the attempted assimilation of M ori into British New Zealanders  245  In the 1960s  as higher education became more available and cities expanded 267  urban culture began to dominate  268  Even though the majority of the population now lives in cities  much of New Zealand s art  literature  film and humour has rural themes  Art Main article  New Zealand art As part of the resurgence of M ori culture  the traditional crafts of carving and weaving are now more widely practised and M ori artists are increasing in number and influence  269  Most M ori carvings feature human figures  generally with three fingers and either a natural looking  detailed head or a grotesque head  270  Surface patterns consisting of spirals  ridges  notches and fish scales decorate most carvings  271  The pre eminent M ori architecture consisted of carved meeting houses  wharenui  decorated with symbolic carvings and illustrations  These buildings were originally designed to be constantly rebuilt  changing and adapting to different whims or needs  272  M ori decorated the white wood of buildings  canoes and cenotaphs using red  a mixture of red ochre and shark fat  and black  made from soot  paint and painted pictures of birds  reptiles and other designs on cave walls  273  M ori tattoos  moko  consisting of coloured soot mixed with gum were cut into the flesh with a bone chisel  274  Since European arrival paintings and photographs have been dominated by landscapes  originally not as works of art but as factual portrayals of New Zealand  275  Portraits of M ori were also common  with early painters often portraying them as  noble savages   exotic beauties or friendly natives  275  The country s isolation delayed the influence of European artistic trends allowing local artists to developed their own distinctive style of regionalism  276  During the 1960s and 70s many artists combined traditional M ori and Western techniques  creating unique art forms  277  New Zealand art and craft has gradually achieved an international audience  with exhibitions in the Venice Biennale in 2001 and the  Paradise Now  exhibition in New York in 2004  269  278  Portrait of Hinepare of Ng ti Kahungunu by Gottfried Lindauer  showing chin moko  pounamu hei tiki and woven cloak M ori cloaks are made of fine flax fibre and patterned with black  red and white triangles  diamonds and other geometric shapes  279 Greenstone was fashioned into earrings and necklaces  with the most well known design being the hei tiki  a distorted human figure sitting cross legged with its head tilted to the side  280  Europeans brought English fashion etiquette to New Zealand  and until the 1950s most people dressed up for social occasions  281  Standards have since relaxed and New Zealand fashion has received a reputation for being casual  practical and lacklustre  282  283  However  the local fashion industry has grown significantly since 2000  doubling exports and increasing from a handful to about 50 established labels  with some labels gaining international recognition  283  Literature Main article  Literature of New Zealand M ori quickly adopted writing as a means of sharing ideas  and many of their oral stories and poems were converted to the written form  284  Most early English literature was obtained from Britain and it was not until the 1950s when local publishing outlets increased that New Zealand literature started to become widely known  285  Although still largely influenced by global trends  modernism  and events  the Great Depression   writers in the 1930s began to develop stories increasingly focused on their experiences in New Zealand  During this period literature changed from a journalistic activity to a more academic pursuit  286  Participation in the world wars gave some New Zealand writers a new perspective on New Zealand culture and with the post war expansion of universities local literature flourished  287  Entertainment New Zealand music has been influenced by blues  jazz  country  rock and roll and hip hop  with many of these genres given a unique New Zealand interpretation  288  M ori developed traditional chants and songs from their ancient South East Asian origins  and after centuries of isolation created a unique  monotonous  and  doleful  sound  289  Flutes and trumpets were used as musical instruments 290  or as signalling devices during war or special occasions  291  Early settlers brought over their ethnic music  with brass bands and choral music being popular  and musicians began touring New Zealand in the 1860s  292  293 Pipe bands became widespread during the early 20th century  294  The New Zealand recording industry began to develop from 1940 onwards and many New Zealand musicians have obtained success in Britain and the USA  288  Some artists release M ori language songs and the M ori tradition based art of kapa haka  song and dance  has made a resurgence  295  The New Zealand Music Awards are held annually by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand  RIANZ   the awards were first held in 1965 by Reckitt  amp  Colman as the Loxene Golden Disc Awards  296  The RIANZ also publishes the country s official weekly record charts  297  Radio first arrived in New Zealand in 1922 and television in 1960  298  The number of New Zealand films significantly increased during the 1970s  299  In 1978 the New Zealand Film Commission started assisting local film makers and many films attained a world audience  some receiving international acknowledgement  Deregulation in the 1980s saw a sudden increase in the numbers of radio and television stations  299  New Zealand television primarily broadcasts American and British programming  along with a large number of Australian and local shows  The country s diverse scenery and compact size  plus government incentives  300  have encouraged some producers to film big budget movies in New Zealand  301  The New Zealand media industry is dominated by a small number of companies  most of which are foreign owned  although the state retains ownership of some television and radio stations  Between 2003 and 2008  Reporters Without Borders consistently ranked New Zealand s press freedom in the top twenty  302  Sports Main article  Sport in New Zealand Statue of mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary gazing towards Aoraki   Mount Cook Most of the major sporting codes played in New Zealand have English origins  303  Golf  netball  tennis and cricket are the four top participatory sports  soccer is the most popular among young people and rugby union attracts the most spectators  304  Victorious rugby tours to Australia and the United Kingdom in the late 1880s and the early 1900s played an early role in instilling a national identity  305  although the sport s influence has since declined  306 Horse racing was also a popular spectator sport and became part of the  Rugby  Racing and Beer  culture during the 1960s  307  M ori participation in European sports was particularly evident in rugby and the country s team performs a haka  traditional M ori challenge  before international matches  308  New Zealand has competitive international teams in rugby union  netball  cricket  rugby league  and
