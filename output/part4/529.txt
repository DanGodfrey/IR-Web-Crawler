government and the native peoples of North America before and after the American Revolutionary War  The wars resulted from the arrival of European colonizers who continuously sought to expand their territory  pushing the indigenous populations westwards  The wars were spurred by ideologies such as Manifest Destiny  which held that the United States was destined to expand from coast to coast on the American continent  and which resulted in the policy of Indian removal  by which indigenous peoples were removed from the areas where Europeans were settling  either forcefully or by means of voluntary exchange of territory through treaties  Contents 1 Effects on indigenous populations 2 Colonial Period 3 East of the Mississippi  1775 1842  3 1 American Revolutionary War 1775 1783 3 2

citation needed  No conclusive evidence exists to determine how many native people lived in North America before the arrival of Columbus  1  2 David Stannard notes that more conservative demographers cite a figure of about 7 or 8 million inhabitants  3  The Library of Congress uses 900 000 as the total number in its educational article  Destroying the Native American Cultures   4  By 1800  the native population of the present day United States had declined to approximately 600 000  and only 250 000 Native Americans remained in the 1890s  5  As the direct result of written and broken treaties  warfare  and of forced assimilation  the Indians were virtually destroyed by the European immigration that created the United States  4  Scholars believe that among the causes of the overwhelming population decline of the American natives were new infectious diseases carried by Europeans  Native Americans had no acquired immunity to such diseases  which had been chronic in Eurasian populations for centuries  6  For instance  some estimates indicate case fatality rates of 80 90  in Native American populations during smallpox epidemics  7  According to the U S  Bureau of the Census  1894    The Indian wars under the government of the United States have been more than 40 in number  They have cost the lives of about 19 000 white men  women and children  including those killed in individual combats  and the lives of about 30 000 Indians   8   edit  Colonial Period While some historians suggest that settlers were engaged in warfare to open further land for settlement  other historians suggest that settlers needed to defend themselves from attacks by the Indians  The wars  which ranged from the 17th century  Jamestown Massacre of 1622  Pequot War of 1637  Anglo Powhatan Wars  King Philip s War  King William s War  as well as Queen Anne s War  Tuscarora War  Yamasee War and Dummer s War at the opening of the 18th century  to the French and Indian War  Pontiac s Rebellion and Lord Dunmore s War after the middle of that century until the Wounded Knee massacre and  closing  of the American frontier in 1890  generally resulted in the opening of Native American lands to further colonization  the conquest of Native Americans and their assimilation  or forced relocation to Indian reservations  External images the Indian Wars The great Dispersion Battles of the

theater of the American Revolutionary War For the American rebels the American Revolutionary War was essentially two parallel wars  while the war in the east was a struggle against British rule  the war in the west was an  Indian War   The newly proclaimed United States competed with the British for control of the territory of Native American nations east of the Mississippi River  The colonial interest in westward colonisation  as opposed to the British policy of maintaining peace by designating areas reserved to Native Americans west of the Appalachians following the end of the Seven Years  War  was one cause of the revolution  citation needed  Most Native Americans who joined the struggle sided with the British  hoping to use the war to reduce settlement and expansion onto their land  The Revolutionary War was  the most extensive and destructive  Indian war in United States history  9  Some native communities were divided over which side to support in the war  For the Iroquois Confederacy  based in New York and Pennsylvania  the American Revolution resulted in civil war  the Six Nations split  with the Oneidas and Tuscaroras siding with the rebels  and Mohawks  Senecas  Cayugas  and Onondagas  fighting for the British  While the Iroquois tried to avoid fighting directly against one another  the Revolution eventually forced intra Iroquois combat  Both sides lost territory under the new political dispensation  The Crown aided the landless Iroquois by rewarding them with a reservation at Grand River in Ontario  In the Southeast  the Cherokee split into a neutral  or pro rebel  faction and a pro British faction  which the rebels referred to as the Chickamaugas  led by Dragging Canoe  Many other tribes were similarly divided  Both immigrant and native noncombatants suffered greatly during the war  and villages and food supplies were frequently destroyed during military expeditions  The largest of these expeditions was the Sullivan Expedition of 1779  which razed more than 40 Iroquois villages  When the British made peace with the Americans in the Treaty of Paris  1783   they ceded a vast amount of Native American territory  without the consent of the indigenous peoples  to the United States  The United States treated the Native Americans who had fought with the British as enemy allies  a conquered people who had lost their land  The federal government of the United States was eager to expand  and the national government did so by purchasing Native American land in treaties and through warfare   edit  Chickamauga Wars Main article  Chickamauga Wars  1776 1794  These frontier conflicts were almost non stop  beginning with Cherokee involvement in the American Revolutionary War and continuing through late 1794  The so called  Chickamauga Cherokee   later called  Lower Cherokee   were those  at first from the Overhill Towns and later from the Lower Towns  Valley Towns  and Middle Towns  who followed the war leader Dragging Canoe southwest  first to the Chickamauga  Chattanooga  Tennessee  area  then to the Five Lower Towns  There they were joined by groups of Muskogee  white Tories  runaway slaves  and renegade Chickasaw  as well as by more than a hundred Shawnee  in exchange for whom a hundred Chickamauga Cherokee warriors migrated north  along with another seventy a few years later  The primary objects of attack were the colonies along the Watauga  Holston  and Nolichucky rivers  and in Carter s Valley in upper East Tennessee  as well as the settlements along the Cumberland River beginning with Fort Nashborough in 1780  even into Kentucky  plus against the colonies  later states  of Virginia  North Carolina  South Carolina  and Georgia  The scope of attacks by the Chickamauga Lower Cherokee and their allies ranged from quick raids by small war parties of a handful of warriors to large campaigns by four or five hundred  and once over a thousand  citation needed  warriors  The Upper Muskogee under Dragging Canoe s close ally Alexander McGillivray frequently joined their campaigns as well as operated separately  and the settlements on the Cumberland came under attack from the Chickasaw  Shawnee from the north  and Delaware  Campaigns by Dragging Canoe and his successor  John Watts  were frequently conducted in conjunction with campaigns in the Northwest  The response by the colonists were usually attacks in which Cherokee towns in peaceful areas were completely destroyed  though usually without great loss of life on either side citation needed   The wars continued until the Treaty of Tellico Blockhouse in November 1794  The Chickamauga Wars were in reality a continuation of what some historians call the Second Cherokee War  fought between the whole Cherokee nation and the colonies as allies of the British in the years 1776 and 1777  waged by those who did not wish to stop resisting frontier encroachments  citation needed   edit  Northwest Indian War The Battle of Fallen Timbers In 1787  the Northwest Ordinance officially organized the Northwest Territory for white settlement  American settlers began pouring into the region  Violence erupted as indigenous tribes resisted this encroachment  and so the administration of President George Washington sent armed expeditions into the area to suppress native resistance  However  in the Northwest Indian War  a pan tribal confederacy led by Blue Jacket  Shawnee   Little Turtle  Miami   Buckongahelas  Lenape   and Egushawa  Ottawa  crushed armies led by Generals Josiah Harmar and Arthur St  Clair  General St  Clair s defeat was the most severe loss ever inflicted upon an American army by Native Americans  The Americans attempted to negotiate a settlement  but Blue Jacket and the Shawnee led confederacy insisted on a boundary line that the Americans found unacceptable  and so a new expedition led by General Anthony Wayne was dispatched  Wayne s army defeated the Indian confederacy at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794  The Indians had hoped for British assistance  when that was not forthcoming  the indigenous people were compelled to sign the Treaty of Greenville in 1795  which ceded modern day Ohio and part of Indiana to the United States   edit  Tecumseh  the Creek War  and the War of 1812 The United States continued to gain title to Native American land after the Treaty of Greenville  at a rate that created alarm in Indian communities  citation needed  In 1800  William Henry Harrison became governor of the Indiana Territory and  under the direction of President Thomas Jefferson  pursued an aggressive policy of obtaining titles to Indian lands  Two Shawnee brothers  Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa  organized Tecumseh s War  another pan tribal resistance to American expansion  While Tecumseh was in the South attempting to recruit allies among the Creeks  Cherokees  and Choctaws  Harrison marched against the Indian confederacy  defeating Tenskwatawa and his followers at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811  The Americans hoped that the victory would end the militant resistance  but Tecumseh instead chose to ally openly with the British  who were soon at war with the Americans in the War of 1812  Like the Revolutionary War  the War of 1812 was also a massive war on the western front  Encouraged by Tecumseh  the Creek War  1813 1814   which began as a civil war within the Creek  Muscogee  nation  became part of the larger struggle against American expansion  Although the war with the British was ultimately a stalemate  the United States was more successful on the western front  Tecumseh was killed by Harrison s army at the Battle of the Thames  ending the resistance in the Old Northwest  The Creeks who fought against the United States were defeated  The First Seminole War in 1818 was in some ways a continuation of the Creek War citation needed  and resulted in the transfer of Florida to the United States in 1819 from Spain  As in the Revolution and the Northwest Indian War  the British abandoned their Indian allies to the Americans after the War of 1812  This proved to be a major turning point in the Indian Wars  marking the last time that Native Americans would turn to a foreign power for assistance against the United States   edit  Removal era wars A dead Sauk and her surviving child with a U S  officer at the Bad Axe Massacre  1832  Numerous Indian removal treaties were signed  Most American Indians reluctantly but peacefully complied with the terms of the removal treaties  often with bitter resignation  citation needed  Some groups  however  went to war to resist the implementation of these treaties  e g   two short wars  the Black Hawk War of 1832 and the Creek War of 1836   as well as the long and costly Second Seminole War  1835 1842    edit  Second Seminole War American settlers began to push into Florida  which was now an American territory and had some of the most fertile lands in the nation  citation needed  Some scholars have noted that covetousness  racism  and claims of  self defense  against Indian raids  real or imagined  became the order of the day in the 1820s  and played a major part in the settlers  determination to  rid Florida of Indians once and for all   10  To compound the tension  runaway black slaves sometimes found refuge in Seminole camps  The inevitable result was clashes between white settlers and the Native Americans already residing there  Andrew Jackson sought to alleviate this problem by signing the Indian Removal Act  which stipulated forced relocation of Native Americans  if necessary  out of Florida  The Seminoles  led by such powerful leaders as Aripeka  Sam Jones   Micanopy  and Osceola  had little or no intention of leaving their ancestral homelands and quickly retaliated against settler theft  encroachment and attacks on their camps  This led to what is known as the Second Seminole War  the longest and most costly war ever waged against Indians  The Seminoles  continued resistance to relocation led Florida to prepare for war  The St  Augustine Militia asked the U S  War Department for the loan of 500 muskets  Five hundred volunteers were mobilized under Brig  Gen  Richard K  Call  Indian war parties raided farms and settlements  and families fled to forts  large towns  or out of the territory altogether  A war party led by Osceola captured a Florida militia supply train  killing eight of its guards and wounding six others  Most of the goods taken were recovered by the militia in another fight a few days later  Sugar plantations along the Atlantic coast south of St  Augustine were destroyed  with many of the slaves on the plantations joining the Seminoles  The U S  Army had 11 companies  about 550 soldiers  stationed in Florida  Fort King  Ocala  had only one company of soldiers  and it was feared that they might be overrun by the Seminoles  Three companies were stationed at Fort Brooke  Tampa   with another two expected imminently  so the army decided to send two companies to Fort King  On December 23  1835  the two companies  totaling 110 men  left Fort Brooke under the command of Major Francis L  Dade  Seminoles shadowed the marching soldiers for five days  On December 28  the Seminoles ambushed the soldiers  and wiped out the command  Only three men survived  and one  Edwin De Courcey  was hunted down and killed by a Seminole the next day  Two survivors  Ransome Clarke and Joseph Sprague  returned to Fort Brooke  Only Clarke  who died of his wounds later  left any account of the battle from the army s perspective  Joseph Sprague was unharmed and lived quite a while longer  but was not able to give an account of the battle because he had sought immediate refuge in a nearby pond  The Seminoles lost just three men  with five wounded  On the same day as the Dade Massacre  Osceola and his followers shot and killed from ambush Wiley Thompson and six others outside of Fort King  Major Ethan Allen Hitchcock was subsequently among those who found the remains of the Dade party in February  In his journal he accounted for the discovery  then vented his bitter discontent with the conflict   The government is in the wrong  and this is the chief cause of the persevering opposition of the Indians  who have nobly defended their country against our attempt to enforce a fraudulent treaty  The natives used every means to avoid a war  but were forced into it by the tyranny of our government   On December 29  General Clinch left Fort Drane  recently established on Clinch s plantation  about twenty miles  32 km  northwest of Fort King  with 750 soldiers  including 500 volunteers on an enlistment due to end January 1  1836  The group was traveling to a Seminole stronghold called the Cove of the Withlacoochee  which is now known as Lake Tsala Apopka  an area of many lakes on the southwest side of the Withlacoochee River  When they reached the river  the soldiers could not find the ford  so Clinch ferried his regular troops across the river in a single canoe they had found  Once they were across and had relaxed  the Seminoles attacked  The troops only saved themselves by fixing bayonets and charging the Seminoles  at the cost of four dead and 59 wounded  The militia provided cover as the army troops then withdrew across the river  In another key skirmish known as the Battle of Lake Okeechobee  Colonel Zachary Taylor saw the first major action of the campaign  Leaving Fort Gardiner on the upper Kissimmee with 1 000 men on December 19  Taylor headed towards Lake Okeechobee  In the first two days ninety Seminoles surrendered  On the third day Taylor stopped to build Fort Basinger  where he left his sick and enough men to guard the Seminoles that had surrendered  Three days later  on Christmas Day  1837  Taylor s column caught up with the main body of the Seminoles on the north shore of Lake Okeechobee  The Seminoles  led by Alligator  Sam Jones  and the recently escaped Coacoochee  were well positioned in a hammock surrounded by sawgrass  The ground was thick mud  and sawgrass easily cuts and burns the skin  Taylor had about 800 men  while the Seminoles numbered fewer than 400  Taylor sent in the Missouri volunteers first  moving his troops squarely into the center of the swamp  His plan was to make a direct attack rather than encircle the Indians  All his men were on foot  Missouri volunteers formed the first line  As soon as they came within range  the Indians opened with heavy fire  The volunteers broke  and their commander  Colonel Gentry  fatally wounded  was unable to rally them  They fled back across the swamp  The fighting in the sawgrass was deadliest for five companies of the Sixth Infantry  every officer but one  and most of their non commissioned officers  were either killed or wounded  When that part of the regiment retired a short distance to re form  they found only four men of these companies unharmed  Only about a dozen Seminoles had been killed in the battle  Nevertheless  the Battle of Lake Okeechobee was hailed as a great victory for Taylor and the army  Twenty six U S  soldiers  including the majority of Taylor s officers and NCOs  were killed  with 112 wounded  compared to only 11 Seminoles killed and 14 wounded  No Seminoles were captured  although Taylor did capture 100 ponies and 600 head of cattle  By 1842  the war was winding down  and most Seminoles  save a few hundred diehards  had left Florida for Oklahoma  Estimates of the true cost of the Seminole War range from  30 000 000 to  40 000 000  But no analysis of the actual cost has been made  Congress appropriated funds for the  suppression of Indian hostilities   but the costs of the Creek War of 1836 are included in that  An inquiry into extravagance in naval operations found that the navy had spent about  511 000 on the war  The investigation did find questionable expenditures  Among other things  while the army had bought dugout canoes for  10 to  15 apiece  the navy spent an average of  226 per canoe  The number of army  navy and marine regulars who served in Florida is given as 10 169  About 30 000 militiamen and volunteers also served in the war  Sources agree that the U S  Army officially recorded 1 466 deaths in the Second Seminole War  mostly from disease  The number killed in action is less clear  Mahon reports 328 regular army killed in action  while Missall reports that Seminoles killed 269 officers and men  Almost half of those deaths occurred in the Dade Massacre  Battle of Lake Okeechobee and Harney Massacre  Similarly  Mahon reports 69 deaths for the navy  while Missal reports 41 for the U S  Navy and Marine Corps  but adds others may have died after being sent out of Florida as incurable  Mahon and the Florida Board of State Institutions agree that 55 volunteer officers and men were killed by the Seminoles  while Missall says the number is unknown  There is no figure for how many militiamen and volunteers died of disease or accident  however  The number of white civilians and Seminoles killed is also uncertain  A northern newspaper carried a report that more than eighty civilians were killed by Indians in Florida in 1839  Nobody kept a cumulative account of the number of Indians killed  or who died of starvation or other privations caused by the war  The Indians who were shipped west did not fare well either  By the end of 1843  3 824 Indians had been shipped from Florida to what became the Indian Territory  but in 1844 only 3 136 remained  As of 1962 there were only 2 343 Seminoles in Oklahoma and perhaps some 1 500 in Florida   edit  West of the Mississippi  1811 1923  Indian Wars West of the Mississippi Battle of Woody Point  1811  Arikara War  1823  Texas Indian

the United States Army are generally known as the Indian Wars  Many of the most well known of these conflicts occurred during and after the Civil War until the closing of the frontier in about 1890  However regions of the West that were settled before the Civil War  such as Texas  New Mexico  Utah  Oregon  California and Washington  saw significant conflicts prior to 1860  Various statistics have been developed concerning the devastation of these wars on the peoples involved  One notable study by Gregory Michno used records dealing with figures  as a direct result of  engagements and concluded that  of the 21 586 total casualties tabulated in this survey  military personnel and civilians accounted for 6 596  31    while Indian casualties totaled about 14 990  69     for the period of 1850 90  However  Michno says he  used the army s estimates in almost every case   amp   the number of casualties in this study are inherently biased toward army estimations   His work includes almost nothing on  Indian war parties   and that  army records are often incomplete   his work is a  workable  number  not a definitive account of events  since it excluded other figures  11  According to Michno  more conflicts with native Americans occurred in the states bordering Mexico than in the interior states  Arizona ranked highest  with 310 known battles fought within the state s boundaries between Americans and the natives  Also  when determining how many deaths resulted from the wars  in each of the American states  Arizona again ranked highest  At least 4 340 people were killed  including both the settlers and the Indians  over twice as many as occurred in Texas  the second highest ranking state  Most of the deaths in Arizona were caused by the Apache  Michno also says that fifty one percent of the Indian war battles between 1850 and 1890 took place in Arizona  Texas and New Mexico  as well as thirty seven percent of the casualties in the county west of the Mississippi River  12   edit  Background The western United States had been penetrated by United States forces and settlers before this period  notably by fur trappers  the Santa Fe Trail  the Oregon Trail and the Mormon emigration to Utah  as well as by settlement of California and Oregon  Relations between American Immigrants and Native Americans were generally peaceful  In the case of the Santa Fe Trail  this was due to the friendly relationship of the Bents of Bent s Fort with the Cheyenne and Arapaho  and in the case of the Oregon Trail  to the peace established by the Treaty of Fort Laramie  Signed in 1851 between the United States and the plains Indians and the Indians of the northern Rocky Mountains  the treaty allowed passage by immigrants and the building of roads and the stationing of troops along the Oregon Trail  The Pike s Peak Gold Rush of 1859 introduced a substantial white population into the Front Range of the Rockies supported by a trading lifeline that crossed the central Great Plains  Advancing settlement following the passage of the Homestead Act and the building of the transcontinental railways following the Civil War further destabilized the situation  placing white settlers into direct competition for the land and resources of the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountain West  13  14  Further factors included discovery of gold in the Black Hills  resulting in the gold rush of 1875 1878  and  earlier  in Montana during the Montana Gold Rush of 1862 1863 and the opening of the Bozeman Trail  which led to Red Cloud s War and later the Great Sioux War of 1876 77  15  As in the East  expansion into the plains and mountains by miners  ranchers and settlers led to increasing conflicts with the indigenous population of the West  Many tribes  from the Utes of the Great Basin to the Nez Perces of Idaho  fought Americans at one time or another  But the Sioux of the Northern Plains and the Apache of the Southwest provided the most celebrated opposition to encroachment on tribal lands  Led by resolute  militant leaders  such as Red Cloud and Crazy Horse  the Sioux were skilled at high speed mounted warfare  The Sioux were relatively new arrivals on the Plains  as  previously  they had been sedentary farmers in the Great Lakes region  Once they learned to capture and ride horses  they moved west  displacing other Indian tribes and became feared warriors  Historically the Apache bands supplemented their economy by raiding others and practiced warfare to avenge a death of a kinsman  The Apache bands were adept at fighting and highly elusive in the environments of desert and canyons  During the American Civil War U S  Army units were withdrawn to fight the war in the east  They were replaced by the volunteer infantry and cavalry raised by the states of California and Oregon  by the western territorial governments or the local militias  These units fought the Indians besides keeping open communications with the east  holding the west for the Union and defeating the Confederate attempt to capture the New Mexico Territory   edit  Texas Main article  Texas Indian Wars Battles  army posts  and the general location of tribes In the 18th century  Spanish settlers in Texas came into conflict with the Apache  Comanche  and Karankawa  among other tribes  Large numbers of Anglo American settlers reached Texas in the 1830s  and from that point until the 1870s  a series of armed confrontations broke out  mostly between Texans and Comanches  The first notable battle was the Fort Parker massacre in 1836  in which a huge war party of Comanches  Kiowa  Witchitas  and Delaware attacked the settler outpost Fort Parker  Despite the small number of white settlers killed during the raid  the abduction of Cynthia Ann Parker caused widespread outrage among Texas  Anglo settlers  Once the Republic of Texas was declared and had secured some sovereignty in their war with Mexico  the Texas government under President Sam Houston pursued a policy of engagement with the Comanches and Kiowa  Ironically  since Houston had lived with the Cherokee  the republic faced a conflict called the Cordova Rebellion  in which Cherokees appear to have joined with Mexican forces to fight the fledgling country  Houston resolved the conflict without resorting to arms  refusing to believe that the Cherokee would take up arms against his government  16  The Lamar administration  which followed Houston  took a very different policy towards the Indians  Under Lamar Texas removed the Cherokee to the west  With that policy in place  the Texas government sought to deport the Comanches and Kiowa  This led to a series of battles  including the Council House Fight  in which  at a peace parley  the Texas militia seized a number of Comanche chiefs and the resulting Great Raid of 1840 and the Battle of Plum Creek  Quanah Parker  son of a Comanche Chief and an Anglo Texas settler  His family s story spans the history of the Texas Indian Wars  The Lamar Administration was known for its failed and expensive Indian policy  the cost of the war with the Indians exceeded the annual revenue of the government throughout his four year term  It was followed by a second Houston administration  which resumed the previous policy of diplomacy  Texas signed treaties with all of the tribes  including the Comanche  After Texas joined the Union in 1846  the struggle between the Plains Indians and the settlers was taken up by the federal government and the state of Texas  The years 1856 1858 were particularly vicious and bloody on the Texas frontier  as settlers continued to expand their settlements into the Comanche homeland  the Comancheria  and 1858 was marked by the first Texan incursion into the heart of the Comancheria  the so called Antelope Hills Expedition  marked by the Battle of Little Robe Creek  This battle signaled the beginning of the end of the Comanche as a viable people  since  for the first time  they were attacked in the heart of their domain  in force  The battles between settlers and Indians continued and in 1860  at the Battle of Pease River  Texas militia destroyed an Indian camp  In the aftermath of the battle  the Texans learned that they had recaptured Cynthia Ann Parker  the little girl captured by the Comanche in 1836  She returned to live with the Parkers  but missed her children  including her son Quanah Parker  He was the son of Parker and Comanche Chief Peta Nocona and would go on to be a Comanche war chief at the First Battle of Adobe Walls  As chief of the Quahadi Comanches  he finally surrendered to the overwhelming force of the federal government and in 1875 moved to a reservation in southwestern Oklahoma   edit  Pacific Northwest Main articles  Cayuse War  Yakima War  Puget Sound War  Rogue River Wars  Spokane   Coeur d Alene   Paloos War  Snake War  Nez Perce War  Bannock War  and Sheepeater Indian War A number of wars occurred in the wake of the Oregon Treaty of 1846 and the creation of Oregon Territory and Washington Territory  Among the causes of conflict were a sudden immigration to the region and a series of gold rushes throughout the Pacific Northwest  The Whitman massacre of 1847 triggered the Cayuse War  which saw fighting from the Cascade Range to the Rocky Mountains  The Cayuse were defeated in 1855  but by then the conflict had expanded and continued in what became known as the Yakima War  1855 1858  One of the triggers of the Yakima War was the creation of Washington Territory and the effort of its first governor  Isaac Stevens  to compel tribes to sign treaties ceding land and establishing reservations  The Yakama signed one of the treaties negotiated during the Walla Walla Council of 1855  and the Yakama Indian Reservation was established  The treaties were poorly received by the native peoples and served mainly to intensify hostilities  Gold discoveries near Fort Colville resulted in many miners crossing Yakama lands via Naches Pass  and conflicts rapidly escalated into violence  It took several years for the US Army to defeat the Yakama  during which time war spread to the Puget Sound region west of the Cascades  The Puget Sound War of 1855 1856 was triggered in part by the Yakima War and in part by the use of intimidation to compel tribes to sign land cession treaties  The Treaty of Medicine Creek  signed in 1855  established an unrealistically small reservation on poor land for the Nisqually and Puyallup people  Violence broke out in the White River valley  along the route to Naches Pass  which connected Nisqually and Yakama lands  Although limited in its magnitude  territorial impact and losses in terms of lives  the Puget Sound War is often remembered in connection with the 1856 Battle of Seattle and the execution of a central figure of the war  Nisqually Chief Leschi  17  In 1858  the fighting on the east side of the Cascades spread  This second phase of the Yakima War is known as the Coeur d Alene War  The Yakama  Palouse  Spokane  and Coeur d Alene tribes were defeated at the Battle of Four Lakes in late 1858  17  In southwest Oregon tensions and skirmishes between American settlers and the Rogue River peoples  starting about 1850  escalated into the Rogue River Wars of 1855 1856  The California Gold Rush helped fuel a large increase in the number of people traveling south through the Rogue River Valley  Gold discoveries continued to trigger violent conflict between prospectores and indigenous peoples  Beginning in 1858  the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush in British Columbia drew large numbers of miners  many from Washington  Oregon  and California  culminating in the Fraser Canyon War  Although this conflict occurred in what is now Canada  the militias involved were formed mostly of Americans  Due to the discovery of gold in Idaho and Oregon in the 1860s  similar conflicts arose that culminated in the Bear River Massacre in 1863 and Snake War from 1864 to 1868  In the late 1870s another series of armed conflicts occurred in Oregon and Idaho  spreading east into Wyoming and Montana  The Nez Perce War of 1877 is known particularly for Chief Joseph and the three month fighting retreat of a band of about 800 Nez Perce  As with the other wars in the Pacific Northwest  the Nez Perce War was caused by a large influx of settlers  the appropriation of Indian lands  and a gold rush  this time in Idaho  The Nez Perce were pressured into a new treaty in 1863  establishing a new  smaller reservation in Idaho  which did not include the tribe s traditional lands in the Wallowa Valley  The Bannock War broke out the following year for similar reasons  The Sheepeater Indian War in 1879 was the last conflict in the area   edit  Southwest Main articles  Navajo Wars  Yuma War  Mohave War  Apache wars  and Black Hawk War  1865 1872  The acquisition of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo M xico from Mexico at the end of the Mexican American War in 1848  and the Gadsden Purchase in 1853  brought about conflicts with native peoples that spanned from 1846 to 1895 in this large geographical area  The first conflicts were in New Mexico Territory and in California and Utah Territory during and after the California Gold Rush  The tribes or bands in the southwest had been engaged in cycles of trading and fighting each other and foreign settlers for centuries prior to the United States  purchasing their region from Mexico in 1848 and 1853  These conflicts with the United States involved every non pueblo tribe in this region and often were a continuation of Mexican Spanish conflicts  The Navajo and Apache conflicts are perhaps the best known  The last major campaign of the U S  military against native Americans in the Southwest involved 5 000 troops in the field  which caused the Apache Geronimo and his band of 24 warriors  women and children to surrender in 1886   edit  California Main articles  Mariposa War  Klamath and Salmon River War  Tule River War  Bald Hills War  Pitt River Expedition  Mendocino War  Owens Valley Indian War  Snake War  and Modoc War Because of the small U S  garrison west of the Rockies  and the economic and political effects of the gold rush  California militias engaged in most of the early conflicts with the Indians  Later  during the American Civil War  California and Oregon State volunteers replaced Federal troops west of the Rocky Mountains and engaged in many conflicts with the Indians including California  Nevada  Utah  New Mexico and the Arizona Territories  Following the Civil War  California was mostly pacified  but Federal troops replaced the volunteers and again took up the struggle against Native Americans in the remote regions of the Mojave Desert  and in the northeast of the state against the Snakes and Modoc for the next three decades   edit  Great Basin Main articles  Walker War  Paiute War  Bear River Massacre  Goshute War  Snake War  Black Hawk War  Utah   Eastern Nevada Expedition  Bannock War  White River War  and Ute Indian Campaign The tribes of the Great Basin  for the most part Shoshone  were severely impacted by the Oregon and California Trails and by Mormon emigration to Utah  Beginning with their encounter with Lewis and Clark the Shoshone had generally had friendly relations with American and British fur traders and trappers  At first  relationships were friendly with travelers on the trails  but  with time  the volume of emigrants severely impacted natural resources in the areas traversed by the trails  Often travelers treated the Indians they encountered badly and the Indians on their part continued to engage in their traditional avocation of stealing horses and other stock  In Utah  expanding Mormon settlement pushed natives from the fertile and well watered valleys where they had lived and the cattle of the Mormons consumed the grasses and other plants which made up the traditional Shoshone diet  While unwilling to compensate the Shoshone  or the Ute  for their lands the Mormons did offer food to the Indians  However relations were not smooth  with the Indians being aggressive and demanding while the Mormons found the burden imposed by the Church leadership onerous  The federal government had little presence in the Great Basin and made little effort to ameliorate the situation  The Indians  their traditional way of life disrupted and in retaliation for outrages suffered at the hands of emigrants  engaged in raiding of travelers along the trails and engaged in aggressive behavior toward Mormon settlers  The efforts of the undisciplined California militia who were stationed in Utah during the Civil War to respond to complaints resulted in the Bear River Massacre  18  Following the massacre a series of treaties were agreed to with the various Shoshone tribes exchanging promises of peace for small annuities and reservations  For the most part Indian title was not addressed in those treaties  19  20   edit  Great Plains Main articles  Dakota War of 1862  Sand Creek Massacre  Colorado War  Sioux Wars  Great Sioux War of 1876 77  Battle of the Little Bighorn  and Wounded Knee Massacre Initially relations between participants in the Pike s Peak gold rush and the Native American tribes of the Front Range and the Platte valley were friendly  21  22  An attempt was made to resolve conflicts by negotiation of the Treaty of Fort Wise which established a reservation in southeastern Colorado  but the settlement was not agreed to by all of the roving warriors  particularly the Dog Soldiers  During the early 1860s tensions increased and culminated in the Colorado War and the Sand Creek Massacre where Colorado volunteers fell on a peaceful Cheyenne village killing women and children  23  which set the stage for further conflict  The peaceful relationship between settlers and the Indians of the Colorado and Kansas plains was maintained faithfully by the tribes  but sentiment grew among the Colorado settlers for Indian removal  The savagery of the attacks on civilians during the Dakota War of 1862 contributed to these sentiments as did the few minor incidents which occurred in the Platte Valley and in areas east of Denver  Regular army troops had been withdrawn for service in the Civil War and were replaced with the Colorado Volunteers  rough men who often favored extermination of the Indians  They were commanded by John Chivington and George L  Shoup who followed the lead of John Evans  territorial governor of Colorado  They adopted a policy of shooting all Indians encountered on sight  a policy which in short time ignited a general war on the Colorado and Kansas plains  the Colorado War  24  Raids by bands of plains Indians on isolated homesteads to the east of Denver  on the advancing settlements in Kansas  and on stage line stations along the South Platte  such as at Julesburg  25  26  and along the Smoky Hill Trail  resulted in settlers in both Colorado and Kansas adopting a murderous attitude towards Native Americans  with calls for extermination  27  Likewise  the savagery shown by the Colorado Volunteers during the Sand Creek massacre resulted in Native Americans  particularly the Dog Soldiers  a band of the Cheyenne  engaging in savage retribution   edit  Dakota War Main article  Dakota War of 1862 Settlers escaping the Dakota War of 1862 The Dakota War of 1862  more commonly called the Sioux Uprising of 1862 in older authorities and popular texts  was the first major armed engagement between the U S  and the Sioux  After six weeks of fighting in Minnesota  lead mostly by Chief Taoyateduta  aka  Little Crow   records conclusively show that more than 500 U S  soldiers and settlers died in the conflict  though many more may have died in small raids or after being captured  The number of Sioux dead in the uprising is mostly undocumented  but after the war  303 Sioux were convicted of murder and rape by U S  military tribunals and sentenced to death  Most of the death sentences were commuted by President Lincoln  but on December 26  1862  in Mankato  Minnesota  38 Dakota Sioux men were hanged in what is still today the largest mass execution in U S  history  28  After the expulsion of the Dakota  some refugees and warriors made their way to Lakota lands in what is now North Dakota  Battles continued between Minnesota regiments and combined Lakota and Dakota forces through 1864  as Colonel Henry Sibley pursued the Sioux into Dakota Territory  Sibley s army defeated the Lakota and Dakota in three major battles in 1863  the Battle of Dead Buffalo Lake on July 26  1863  the Battle of Stony Lake on July 28  1863  and the Battle of Whitestone Hill on September 3  1863  The Sioux retreated further  but again faced an American army in 1864  this time  Gen  Alfred Sully led a force from near Fort Pierre  South Dakota  and decisively defeated the Sioux at the Battle of Killdeer Mountain on July 28  1864   edit  The Sand Creek massacre and the Sioux War of 1865 Main articles  Sand Creek massacre  Colorado War  and Sioux Wars On November 29  1864  Colorado volunteers attacked a peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho village camped on Sand Creek in southeastern Colorado  Under orders to take no prisoners  the militia killed and mutilated about 200 of the Indians  two thirds of whom were women and children  29 taking scalps and other grisly trophies of battle  30  The Indians at Sand Creek had been assured by the U S  Government that they would be safe in the territory they were occupying  but anti Indian sentiments by white settlers were running high  Later congressional investigations resulted in a short lived public outcry against the slaughter of the Native Americans  Following the massacre  the survivors joined the camps of the Cheyenne on the Smokey Hill and Republican Rivers  There  the war pipe was smoked and passed from camp to camp among the Sioux  Cheyenne  and Arapaho camped in the area and an attack on the stage station and fort at Julesburg was planned and carried out in January 1865  This successful attack was followed up by numerous raids along the South Platte both east and west of Julesburg and a second raid on Julesburg in early February  A great deal of loot was captured and many whites killed  The bulk of the Indians then moved north into Nebraska on their way to the Black Hills and the Powder River 31  32  In the spring of 1865 raids continued along the Oregon trail in Nebraska and the Sioux  the Northern Cheyenne  the Northern Arapaho together with the warriors who had come north after the Sand Creek massacre raided the Oregon Trail along the North Platte River  and in July 1865 attacked the troops stationed at the bridge across the North Platte at the present site of Casper  Wyoming  the Battle of the Platte Bridge Station  33  34   edit  Black Hills War Custer and Bloody Knife  kneeling left   Custer s favorite scout  In 1875  the Great Sioux War of 1876 77  the last serious Sioux war erupted  when the Dakota gold rush penetrated the Black Hills  The U S  Army did not keep miners off Sioux  Lakota  hunting grounds  yet  when ordered to take action against bands of Sioux hunting on the range  according to their treaty rights  the Army moved vigorously  In 1876  after several indecisive encounters  General George Custer found the main encampment of the Lakota and their allies at the Battle of the Little Bighorn  Custer and his men who were separated from their main body of troops were all killed by the far more numerous Indians who had the tactical advantage  They were led in the field by Crazy Horse and inspired by Sitting Bull s earlier vision of victory  The massacre of Custer and his troopers as a popularized episode in the history of western Indian warfare was fostered by an advertising campaign by the brewery  Anheuser Busch  The enterprising company ordered reprints of a dramatic painting that depicted  Custer s Last Fight  and had them framed and hung in many American saloons  helping to create lasting impressions of the battle and the brewery s products in the minds of bar patrons  35  36  Later  in 1890  a Ghost Dance ritual on the Northern Lakota reservation at Wounded Knee  South Dakota  led to the Army s attempt to subdue the Lakota  On December 29 during this attempt  gunfire erupted  and soldiers killed up to 300 Indians  mostly old men  women and children in the Wounded Knee Massacre  The approximately 25 soldiers who died may have been killed by friendly fire during the battle  Long before this  the means of subsistence and the societies of the indigenous population of the Great Plains had been destroyed by the slaughter of the buffalo  driven almost to extinction in the 1880s by indiscriminate hunting   edit  Last conflicts Buffalo Soldiers of the 25th Infantry Regiment  1890 October 5  1898  Leech Lake  Minnesota  Battle of Sugar Point  Last Medal

  edit  Historiography In American history books  the Indian Wars have often been treated as a relatively minor part of the military history of the United States and were long treated from the point of view of European Americans  Only in the last few decades of the 20th century did a significant number of historians begin to include the American Indian point of view in their writings about the wars  dealing more objectively with the US government s failures and emphasizing the impact of the wars on native peoples and their cultures  A well known and influential book in popular history was Dee Brown s Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee  1970   In academic history  Francis Jennings s The Invasion of America  Indians  Colonialism  and the Cant of Conquest  New York  Norton  1975  was notable for challenging traditional portrayal of the wars between the indigenous peoples and colonists  and the later American pioneers in the West  Many more histories have been written since then that reflect new thinking about the conflicts   edit  See also Mexican Indian Wars Australian frontier wars  comparable events in Australian history Captives in American Indian Wars Indian Campaign Medal
