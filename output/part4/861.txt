influential figure in popular music and culture for five decades  1  2  Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when he was an informal chronicler and a seemingly reluctant figurehead of social unrest  A number of Dylan s early songs  such as  Blowin  in the Wind  and  The Times They Are a Changin    became anthems for the US civil rights 3  and anti war 4  movements  Leaving his initial base in the culture of folk music behind  Dylan s six minute single  Like a Rolling Stone  has been described as radically altering the parameters of popular music in 1965  5  However  his recordings employing electric instruments attracted denunciation and criticism from others in the folk movement  Dylan s lyrics incorporated a variety of political  social  philosophical  and literary influences  They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed hugely to the then burgeoning counterculture  Initially inspired by the songs of Woody Guthrie  6 Robert Johnson  7  and Hank Williams  as well as the music and performance styles of Buddy Holly and Little Richard  8  Dylan has both amplified and personalized musical genres  His recording career  spanning fifty years  has explored numerous distinct traditions in American song from folk  blues and country to gospel  rock and roll  and rockabilly to English  Scottish  and Irish folk music  embracing even jazz and swing  9  Dylan performs with guitar  keyboards  and harmonica  Backed by a changing line up of musicians  he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour  His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career  but his greatest contribution is generally considered to be his songwriting  1  Since 1994  Dylan has published three books of drawings and paintings  and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries  10  11  As a songwriter and musician  Dylan has received numerous awards over the years including Grammy  Golden Globe  and Academy Awards  he has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame  and Songwriters Hall of Fame  In 2005  the street on which Dylan grew up in Hibbing  Minnesota  was formally re named Bob Dylan Drive  12  In 2008  a road called the Bob Dylan Pathway was opened in the singer s honor in his birthplace of Duluth  Minnesota  13  The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2008 awarded him a special citation for  his profound impact on popular music and American culture  marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power   14  Contents 1 Life and

career  edit  Origins and musical beginnings Bob Dylan was born  Robert Allen Zimmerman   Hebrew name                       Shabtai Zisel ben Avraham   15  16  in St  Mary s Hospital on May 24  1941  in Duluth  Minnesota  17  18  and raised in Hibbing  Minnesota  on the Mesabi Iron Range west of Lake Superior  His paternal grandparents  Zigman and Anna Zimmerman  emigrated from Odessa in the Russian Empire  now Ukraine  to the United States following the anti Semitic pogroms of 1905  19  His maternal grandparents  Benjamin and Lybba Edelstein  were Lithuanian Jews who arrived in the United States in 1902  19  In his autobiography Chronicles  Volume One  Dylan writes that his paternal grandmother s maiden name was Kyrgyz and her family originated from Kars  Turkey  20  Dylan s parents  Abram Zimmerman and Beatrice  Beatty  Stone  were part of the area s small but close knit Jewish community  Robert Zimmerman lived in Duluth until age six  when his father was stricken with polio and the family returned to his mother s home town  Hibbing  where Zimmerman spent the rest of his childhood  Robert Zimmerman spent much of his youth listening to the radio first to blues and country stations broadcasting from Shreveport  Louisiana and  later  to early rock and roll  8  He formed several bands while he attended Hibbing High School  The Shadow Blasters was short lived  but his next  The Golden Chords  lasted longer and played covers of Little Richard rock and roll 21  and other popular songs  22  Their performance of Danny and the Juniors   Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay  at their high school talent show was so loud that the principal cut the microphone off  23  In 1959  his High School yearbook carried  beneath his photo  the caption   Robert Zimmerman  to join  Little Richard    21  24  The same year  using the name Elston Gunnn  sic   he performed two dates with Bobby Vee  playing piano and providing handclaps  25  26  27  Zimmerman moved to Minneapolis in September 1959 and enrolled at the University of Minnesota  where his early focus on rock and roll gave way to an interest in American folk music  In 1985  Dylan explained the attraction that folk music had exerted on him  The thing about rock n roll is that for me anyway it wasn t enough     There were great catch phrases and driving pulse rhythms     but the songs weren t serious or didn t reflect life in a realistic way  I knew that when I got into folk music  it was more of a serious type of thing  The songs are filled with more despair  more sadness  more triumph  more faith in the supernatural  much deeper feelings  28  He soon began to perform at the 10 O clock Scholar  a coffee house a few blocks from campus  and became actively involved in the local Dinkytown folk music circuit  29  30  During his Dinkytown days  Zimmerman began introducing himself as  Bob Dylan   31  In his autobiography  Dylan acknowledged that he had been influenced by the poetry of Dylan Thomas  32  a 1  Explaining his change of name in a 2004 interview  Dylan remarked   You re born  you know  the wrong names  wrong parents  I mean  that happens  You call yourself what you want to call yourself  This is the land of the free   33   edit  1960s  edit  Relocation to New York and record deal Dylan dropped out of college at the end of his freshman year  In January 1961  he traveled to New York City  hoping to perform there and visit his musical idol Woody Guthrie  34  who was seriously ill with Huntington s Disease in Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital  35  Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and was the biggest influence on his early performances  Describing Guthrie s impact on him  Dylan later wrote   The songs themselves had the infinite sweep of humanity in them      He  was the true voice of the American spirit  I said to myself I was going to be Guthrie s greatest disciple   36  As well as visiting Guthrie in the hospital  Dylan befriended Guthrie s acolyte Ramblin  Jack Elliott  Much of Guthrie s repertoire was actually channeled through Elliott  and Dylan paid tribute to Elliott in Chronicles  2004   37  From February 1961  Dylan played at various clubs around Greenwich Village  He befriended and picked up material from many folk singers in the Village scene  including Dave Van Ronk  Fred Neil  Odetta  the New Lost City Ramblers  and Irish musicians Tommy Makem and the Clancy Brothers  38  Dylan later described Liam Clancy as  the best ballad singer I ever heard   39  In September  Dylan gained some public recognition when Robert Shelton wrote a positive review in The New York Times of a show at Gerde s Folk City  40  The same month Dylan played harmonica on folk singer Carolyn Hester s eponymous third album  which brought his talents to the attention of the album s producer John Hammond  41  Hammond signed Dylan to Columbia Records in October  The performances on his first Columbia album  Bob Dylan  1962   consisted of familiar folk  blues and gospel material combined with two original compositions  The album made little impact  selling only 5 000 copies in its first year  just enough to break even  42  Within Columbia Records  some referred to the singer as  Hammond s Folly  and suggested dropping his contract  Hammond defended Dylan vigorously  In March 1962  Dylan contributed harmonica and back up vocals to the album Three Kings and the Queen  accompanying Victoria Spivey and Big Joe Williams on a recording for Spivey Records  43  While working for Columbia  Dylan also recorded several songs under the pseudonym Blind Boy Grunt  44  for Broadside Magazine  a folk music magazine and record label  45  Dylan used the pseudonym Bob Landy to record as a piano player on the 1964 anthology album  The Blues Project  issued by Elektra Records  44  Under the pseudonym Tedham Porterhouse  Dylan contributed harmonica to Ramblin  Jack Elliott s 1964 album Jack Elliott  44  With Joan Baez during the civil rights  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom   August 28  1963 Dylan made two important career moves in August 1962  He legally changed his name to Bob Dylan  46  and signed a management contract with Albert Grossman  47  Grossman remained Dylan s manager until 1970  and was notable both for his sometimes confrontational personality  and for the fiercely protective loyalty he displayed towards his principal client  48  Dylan subsequently said of Grossman   He was kind of like a Colonel Tom Parker figure     you could smell him coming   30  Tensions between Grossman and John Hammond led to Hammond being replaced as the producer of Dylan s second album by the young African American jazz producer Tom Wilson  49  From December 1962 to January 1963  Dylan made his first trip to the United Kingdom  50  He had been invited by TV director Philip Saville to appear in a drama  The Madhouse on Castle Street  which Saville was directing for BBC Television  51  At the end of the play  Dylan performed  Blowin  in the Wind   one of the first major public performances of the song  52  The film recording of The Madhouse on Castle Street was destroyed by the BBC in 1968  51  While in London  Dylan performed at several London folk clubs  including Les Cousins  The Pinder of Wakefield  53  and Bunjies  50  He also learned new songs from several UK performers  including Martin Carthy  50  By the time Dylan s second album  The Freewheelin  Bob Dylan  was released in May 1963  he had begun to make his name as both a singer and a songwriter  Many of the songs on this album were labeled protest songs  inspired partly by Guthrie and influenced by Pete Seeger s passion for topical songs  54   Oxford Town   for example  was a sardonic account of James Meredith s ordeal as the first black student to risk enrollment at the University of Mississippi  55  Bob Dylan in November 1963 His most famous song at this time   Blowin  in the Wind   partially derived its melody from the traditional slave song  No More Auction Block   while its lyrics questioned the social and political status quo  56  The song was widely recorded and became an international hit for Peter  Paul and Mary  setting a precedent for many other artists who had hits with Dylan s songs   A Hard Rain s a Gonna Fall  was based on the tune of the folk ballad  Lord Randall   With its veiled references to nuclear apocalypse  it gained even more resonance when the Cuban missile crisis developed only a few weeks after Dylan began performing it  57  Like  Blowin  in the Wind    A Hard Rain s a Gonna Fall  marked an important new direction in modern songwriting  blending a stream of consciousness  imagist lyrical attack with a traditional folk form  58   Blowin  in the Wind  Blowin  in the Wind was  according to critic Andy Gill   the song with which Dylan s name is most inextricably linked  and safeguarded his reputation as a civil libertarian through any number of changes in style and attitude   59  Problems listening to this file  See media help  While Dylan s topical songs solidified his early reputation  Freewheelin  also included a mixture of love songs and jokey  surreal talking blues  Humor was a large part of Dylan s persona  60  and the range of material on the album impressed many listeners  including The Beatles  George Harrison said   We just played it  just wore it out  The content of the song lyrics and just the attitude it was incredibly original and wonderful   61  The rough edge of Dylan s singing was unsettling to some early listeners but an attraction to others  Describing the impact that Dylan had on her and her husband  Joyce Carol Oates wrote   When we first heard this raw  very young  and seemingly untrained voice  frankly nasal  as if sandpaper could sing  the effect was dramatic and electrifying   62  Many of his most famous early songs first reached the public through more immediately palatable versions by other performers  such as Joan Baez  who became Dylan s advocate  as well as his lover  63  Baez was influential in bringing Dylan to national and international prominence by recording several of his early songs and inviting him onstage during her own concerts  64  Others who recorded and had hits with Dylan s songs in the early and mid 1960s included The Byrds  Sonny and Cher  The Hollies  Peter  Paul and Mary  The Association  Manfred Mann  and The Turtles  Most attempted to impart a pop feel and rhythm to the songs  while Dylan and Baez performed them mostly as sparse folk pieces  The cover versions became so ubiquitous that CBS started to promote him with the tag  Nobody Sings Dylan Like Dylan   65   Mixed Up Confusion   recorded during the Freewheelin  sessions with a backing band  was released as a single and then quickly withdrawn  In contrast to the mostly solo acoustic performances on the album  the single showed a willingness to experiment with a rockabilly sound  Cameron Crowe described it as  a fascinating look at a folk artist with his mind wandering towards Elvis Presley and Sun Records   66   edit  Protest and Another Side In May 1963  Dylan s political profile was raised when he walked out of The Ed Sullivan Show  During rehearsals  Dylan had been informed by CBS Television s  head of program practices  that the song he was planning to perform   Talkin  John Birch Paranoid Blues   was potentially libelous to the John Birch Society  Rather than comply with the censorship  Dylan refused to appear on the program  67   The Times They Are a Changin   Dylan said of  The Times They Are a Changin     This was definitely a song with a purpose  I wanted to write a big song  some kind of theme song  with short concise verses that piled up on each other in a hypnotic way  The civil rights movement and the folk music movement were pretty close and allied together at that time   28  Problems listening to this file  See media help  By this time  Dylan and Baez were both prominent in the civil rights movement  singing together at the March on Washington on August 28  1963  68  Dylan s third album  The Times They Are a Changin   reflected a more politicized and cynical Dylan  69  The songs often took as their subject matter contemporary  real life stories  with  Only A Pawn In Their Game  addressing the murder of civil rights worker Medgar Evers  and the Brechtian  The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll  the death of black hotel barmaid Hattie Carroll  at the hands of young white socialite William Zantzinger  70  On a more general theme   Ballad of Hollis Brown  and  North Country Blues  address the despair engendered by the breakdown of farming and mining communities  This political material was accompanied by two personal love songs   Boots of Spanish Leather  and  One Too Many Mornings   71  By the end of 1963  Dylan felt both manipulated and constrained by the folk and protest movements  72  These tensions were publicly displayed when  accepting the  Tom Paine Award  from the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee shortly after the assassination of John F  Kennedy  an intoxicated Dylan brashly questioned the role of the committee  characterized the members as old and balding  and claimed to see something of himself  and of every man  in Kennedy s alleged assassin  Lee Harvey Oswald  73  Bobby Dylan  as the college yearbook lists him  St  Lawrence University  upstate New York  November 1963 Another Side of Bob Dylan  recorded on a single June evening in 1964  74  had a lighter mood than its predecessor  The surreal  humorous Dylan reemerged on  I Shall Be Free  10  and  Motorpsycho Nightmare    Spanish Harlem Incident  and  To Ramona  are romantic and passionate love songs  while  Black Crow Blues  and  I Don t Believe You  She Acts Like We Never Have Met   suggest the rock and roll soon to dominate Dylan s music   It Ain t Me Babe   on the surface a song about spurned love  has been described as a rejection of the role his reputation had thrust at him  75  His newest direction was signaled by two lengthy songs  the impressionistic  Chimes of Freedom   which sets elements of social commentary against a denser metaphorical landscape in a style later characterized by Allen Ginsberg as  chains of flashing images   76  and  My Back Pages   which attacks the simplistic and arch seriousness of his own earlier topical songs and seems to predict the backlash he was about to encounter from his former champions as he took a new direction  77  In the latter half of 1964 and 1965  Dylan s appearance and musical style changed rapidly  as he made his move from leading contemporary songwriter of the folk scene to folk rock pop music star  His scruffy jeans and work shirts were replaced by a Carnaby Street wardrobe  sunglasses day or night  and pointy  Beatle boots   A London reporter wrote   Hair that would set the teeth of a comb on edge  A loud shirt that would dim the neon lights of Leicester Square  He looks like an undernourished cockatoo   78  Dylan also began to spar in increasingly surreal ways with his interviewers  Appearing on the Les Crane TV show and asked about a movie he was planning to make  he told Crane it would be a cowboy horror movie  Asked if he played the cowboy  Dylan replied   No  I play my mother   79   edit  Going electric Main article  Electric Dylan controversy Dylan s April 1965 album Bringing It All Back Home was yet another stylistic leap  80  featuring his first recordings made with electric instruments  The first single   Subterranean Homesick Blues   owed much to Chuck Berry s  Too Much Monkey Business   81  its free association lyrics have been described as both harkening back to the manic energy of Beat poetry and as a forerunner of rap and hip hop  82  The song was provided with an early music video which opened D  A  Pennebaker s cin ma v rit  presentation of Dylan s 1965 tour of England  Dont Look Back  83  Instead of miming to the recording  Dylan illustrated the lyrics by throwing cue cards containing key words from the song on the ground  Pennebaker has said the sequence was Dylan s idea  and it has been widely imitated in both music videos and advertisements  84  The B side of Bringing It All Back Home consisted of four long songs on which Dylan accompanied himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica  85   Mr  Tambourine Man  quickly became one of Dylan s best known songs when The Byrds recorded an electric version that reached number one in both the U S  and the U K  charts  86  87   It s All Over Now Baby Blue  and  It s Alright Ma  I m Only Bleeding   were acclaimed as two of Dylan s most important compositions  85  88  In the summer of 1965  as the headliner at the Newport Folk Festival  Dylan performed his first electric set since his high school days with a pickup group drawn mostly from the Paul Butterfield Blues Band  featuring Mike Bloomfield  guitar   Sam Lay  drums  and Jerome Arnold  bass   plus Al Kooper  organ  and Barry Goldberg  piano   89  Dylan had appeared at Newport in 1963 and 1964  but in 1965 Dylan  met with a mix of cheering and booing  left the stage after only three songs  One version of the legend has it that the boos were from the outraged folk fans whom Dylan had alienated by appearing  unexpectedly  with an electric guitar  Murray Lerner  who filmed the performance  said   I absolutely think that they were booing Dylan going electric   90  An alternative account claims audience members were merely upset by poor sound quality and a surprisingly short set  This account is supported by Kooper and one of the directors of the festival  who reports his audio recording of the concert proves that the only boos were in reaction to the emcee s announcement that there was only enough time for a short set  91  92  Nevertheless  Dylan s 1965 Newport performance provoked a hostile response from the folk music establishment  93  94  In the September issue of Sing Out   singer Ewan MacColl wrote   Our traditional songs and ballads are the creations of extraordinarily talented artists working inside disciplines formulated over time     But what of Bobby Dylan   scream the outraged teenagers    Only a completely non critical audience  nourished on the watery pap of pop music  could have fallen for such tenth rate drivel   95  On July 29  just four days after his controversial performance at Newport  Dylan was back in the studio in New York  recording  Positively 4th Street   The lyrics teemed with images of vengeance and paranoia  96  and it was widely interpreted as Dylan s put down of former friends from the folk community friends he had known in the clubs along West 4th Street  97   edit  Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde  Like a Rolling Stone  Dylan s 1965 hit single  which appeared on the album Highway 61 Revisited  In 2004  it was labelled the Greatest Song of All Time by Rolling Stone magazine  98  Problems listening to this file  See media help  In July 1965  Dylan released the single  Like a Rolling Stone   which peaked at No 2 in the U S  and at No 4 in the UK charts  At over six minutes  the song has been widely credited with altering attitudes about what a pop single could convey  Bruce Springsteen  in his speech during Dylan s inauguration into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame said that on first hearing the single   that snare shot sounded like somebody d kicked open the door to your mind   99  In 2004  and again in 2011  Rolling Stone Magazine listed it as number one on its list of  The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time   98  100  The song also opened Dylan s next album  Highway 61 Revisited  titled after the road that led from Dylan s Minnesota to the musical hotbed of New Orleans  101  The songs were in the same vein as the hit single  flavored by Mike Bloomfield s blues guitar and Al Kooper s organ riffs   Desolation Row  offers the sole acoustic exception  with Dylan making surreal allusions to a variety of figures in Western culture during this epic song  which was described by Andy Gill as  an 11 minute epic of entropy  which takes the form of a Fellini esque parade of grotesques and oddities featuring a huge cast of celebrated characters  some historical  Einstein  Nero   some biblical  Noah  Cain and Abel   some fictional  Ophelia  Romeo  Cinderella   some literary  T S  Eliot and Ezra Pound   and some who fit into none of the above categories  notably Dr  Filth and his dubious nurse   102  In support of the record  Dylan was booked for two U S  concerts and set about assembling a band  Mike Bloomfield was unwilling to leave the Butterfield Band  so Dylan mixed Al Kooper and Harvey Brooks from his studio crew with bar band stalwarts Robbie Robertson and Levon Helm  best known at the time for being part of Ronnie Hawkins s backing band The Hawks  later to become The Band   103  On August 28 at Forest Hills Tennis Stadium  the group was heckled by an audience still annoyed by Dylan s electric sound  The band s reception on September 3 at the Hollywood Bowl was more favorable  104  While Dylan and the Hawks met increasingly receptive audiences on tour  their studio efforts floundered  Producer Bob Johnston persuaded Dylan to record in Nashville in February 1966  and surrounded him with a cadre of top notch session men  At Dylan s insistence  Robertson and Kooper came down from New York City to play on the sessions  105  The Nashville sessions produced the double album Blonde on Blonde  1966   featuring what Dylan later called  that thin wild mercury sound   106  Al Kooper described the album as  taking two cultures and smashing them together with a huge explosion   the musical world of Nashville and the world of the  quintessential New York hipster  Bob Dylan  107  On November 22  1965  Dylan secretly married 25 year old former model Sara Lownds  108  Some of Dylan s friends  including Ramblin  Jack Elliott  claim that  in conversation immediately after the event  Dylan denied that he was married  108  Journalist Nora Ephron first made the news public in the New York Post in February 1966 with the headline  Hush  Bob Dylan is wed   109  Dylan undertook a world tour of Australia and Europe in the spring of 1966  Each show was split into two parts  Dylan performed solo during the first half  accompanying himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica  In the second half  backed by the Hawks  he played high voltage electric music  This contrast provoked many fans  who jeered and slow handclapped  110  The tour culminated in a famously raucous confrontation between Dylan and his audience at the Manchester Free Trade Hall in England on May 17  1966  111  An official recording of this concert was finally released in 1998  The Bootleg Series Vol  4  Bob Dylan Live 1966  At the climax of the evening  a member of the audience  angered by Dylan s electric backing  shouted   Judas   to which Dylan responded   I don t believe you     You re a liar   Dylan turned to his band and said   Play it fucking loud   112  as they launched into the final song of the night  Like a Rolling Stone   During his 1966 tour  Dylan was frequently described as exhausted and acting  as if on a death trip   113 D  A  Pennebaker  the film maker accompanying the tour  described Dylan as  taking a lot of amphetamine and who knows what else   114  In a 1969 interview with Jann Wenner  Dylan said   I was on the road for almost five years  It wore me down  I was on drugs  a lot of things    just to keep going  you know   115  In 2011  BBC Radio 4 reported that  in an interview which Robert Shelton had taped in 1966  Dylan claimed that he had kicked a heroin habit in New York City   I got very  very strung out for a while    I had about a  25 a day habit and I kicked it   116  Some journalists questioned the validity of this confession  pointing out that Dylan had  been telling journalists wild lies about his past since the earliest days of his career   117  118   edit  Motorcycle accident and reclusion After his European tour  Dylan returned to New York  but the pressures on him increased  ABC Television had paid an advance for a TV show they could screen  119  His publisher  Macmillan  was demanding a finished manuscript of the poem novel Tarantula  Manager Albert Grossman had already scheduled an extensive concert tour for that summer and fall  On July 29  1966  Dylan crashed his 500cc Triumph Tiger 100 motorcycle on a road near his home in Woodstock  New York  throwing him to the ground  Though the extent of his injuries were never fully disclosed  Dylan said that he broke several vertebrae in his neck  120  Mystery still surrounds the circumstances of the accident since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized  120  Dylan s biographers have written that the crash offered Dylan the much needed chance to escape from the pressures that had built up around him  120  121  Dylan confirmed this interpretation of the crash when he stated in his autobiography   I had been in a motorcycle accident and I d been hurt  but I recovered  Truth was that I wanted to get out of the rat race   122  In the wake of his accident  Dylan withdrew from the public and  apart from a few select appearances  did not tour again for almost eight years  123  Once Dylan was well enough to resume creative work  he began editing film footage of his 1966 tour for Eat the Document  a rarely exhibited follow up to Dont Look Back  A rough cut was shown to ABC Television and was promptly rejected as incomprehensible to a mainstream audience  124  In 1967 he began recording music with the Hawks at his home and in the basement of the Hawks  nearby house  called  Big Pink   125  These songs  initially compiled as demos for other artists to record  provided hit singles for Julie Driscoll   This Wheel s on Fire    The Byrds   You Ain t Goin  Nowhere    Nothing Was Delivered    and Manfred Mann   Mighty Quinn    Columbia belatedly released selections from them in 1975 as The Basement Tapes  Over the years  more and more of the songs recorded by Dylan and his band in 1967 appeared on various bootleg recordings  culminating in a five CD bootleg set titled The Genuine Basement Tapes  containing 107 songs and alternate takes  126  In the coming months  the Hawks recorded the album Music from Big Pink using songs they first worked on in their basement in Woodstock  and renamed themselves The Band  127  thus beginning a long and successful recording and performing career of their own  In October and November 1967  Dylan returned to Nashville  128  Back in the recording studio after a 19 month break  he was accompanied only by Charlie McCoy on bass  129 Kenny Buttrey on drums  130  and Pete Drake on steel guitar  131  The result was John Wesley Harding  a quiet  contemplative record of shorter songs  set in a landscape that drew on both the American West and the Bible  The sparse structure and instrumentation  coupled with lyrics that took the Judeo Christian tradition seriously  marked a departure not only from Dylan s own work but from the escalating psychedelic fervor of the 1960s musical culture  132  It included  All Along the Watchtower   with lyrics derived from the Book of Isaiah  21 5 9   The song was later recorded by Jimi Hendrix  whose version Dylan later acknowledged as definitive  28  Woody Guthrie died on October 3  1967  and Dylan made his first live appearance in twenty months at a Guthrie memorial concert held at Carnegie Hall on January 20  1968  where he was backed by The Band   Lay Lady Lay   Lay Lady Lay   on the country album Nashville Skyline  has been one of Dylan s biggest hits  reaching No 7 in the U S A  133  Problems listening to this file  See media help  Dylan s next release  Nashville Skyline  1969   was virtually a mainstream country record featuring instrumental backing by Nashville musicians  a mellow voiced Dylan  a duet with Johnny Cash  and the hit single  Lay Lady Lay   134  Dylan and Cash also recorded a series of duets  including Dylan s  One Too Many Mornings   but they were not used on the album  In May 1969  Dylan appeared on the first episode of Johnny Cash s new television show  duetting with Cash on  Girl from the North Country    I Threw It All Away  and  Living the Blues   Dylan next travelled to England to top the bill at the Isle of Wight rock festival on August 31  1969  after rejecting overtures to appear at the Woodstock Festival far closer to his home  135   edit  1970s In the early 1970s  critics charged that Dylan s output was of varied and unpredictable quality  Rolling Stone magazine writer Greil Marcus notoriously asked  What is this shit   on first listening to Self Portrait  released in June 1970  136  137  In general  Self Portrait  a double LP including few original songs  was poorly received  138  In October 1970  Dylan released New Morning  which some considered a return to form  139  In November 1968  Dylan had co written  I d Have You Anytime  with George Harrison  140  Harrison recorded both  I d Have You Anytime  and Dylan s  If Not For You  for his 1970 solo triple album All Things Must Pass  Dylan s surprise appearance at Harrison s 1971 Concert for Bangladesh attracted much media coverage  reflecting that Dylan s live appearances had become rare  141  Between March 16 and 19  1971  Dylan reserved three days at Blue Rock Studios  a small studio in New York s Greenwich Village  These sessions resulted in one single   Watching the River Flow   and a new recording of  When I Paint My Masterpiece   71  On November 4  1971 Dylan recorded  George Jackson   which he released a week later  71  For many  the single was a surprising return to protest material  mourning the killing of Black Panther George Jackson in San Quentin Prison that summer  142  Dylan contributed piano and harmony vocals to Steve Goodman s album  Somebody Else s Troubles  under the pseudonym Robert Milkwood Thomas in September 1972  143  In 1972  Dylan signed onto Sam Peckinpah s film Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid  providing songs and backing music for the movie  and playing the role of  Alias   a member of Billy s gang with some historical basis  144  Despite the film s failure at the box office  the song  Knockin  on Heaven s Door  has proven its durability as one of Dylan s most extensively covered songs  145  146   edit  Return to touring Bob Dylan and The Band touring in Chicago  1974 Dylan began 1973 by signing with a new record label  David Geffen s Asylum Records  when his contract with Columbia Records expired  On his next album  Planet Waves  he used The Band as backing group  while rehearsing for a major tour  The album included two versions of  Forever Young   which became one of his most popular songs  147  As one critic described it  the song projected  something hymnal and heartfelt that spoke of the father in Dylan   148  and Dylan himself commented   I wrote it thinking about one of my boys and not wanting to be too sentimental   149  Biographer Howard Sounes noted that Jakob Dylan believed the song was about him  147  Columbia Records simultaneously released Dylan  a haphazard collection of studio outtakes  almost exclusively cover songs   which was widely interpreted as a churlish response to Dylan s signing with a rival record label  150  In January 1974  Dylan returned to live touring after a break of seven years  backed by The Band  he embarked on a high profile  coast to coast North American tour  playing 40 concerts  A live double album of the tour  Before the Flood  was released on Asylum Records  Soon  Columbia Records sent word that they  will spare nothing to bring Dylan back into the fold   151  Dylan had second thoughts about Asylum  apparently miffed that while there had been millions of unfulfilled ticket requests for the 1974 tour  Geffen had managed to sell only 700 000 copies of Planet Waves  151  Dylan returned to Columbia Records  which subsequently reissued his two Asylum albums on their imprint   Tangled Up in Blue  Dylan said of the opening song from Blood on the Tracks   I was trying to deal with the concept of time  and the way the characters change from the first person to the third person  and you re never sure if the first person is talking or the third person  But as you look at the whole thing it really doesn t matter   28  Problems listening to this file  See media help  After the tour  Dylan and his wife became publicly estranged  He filled a small red notebook with songs about relationships and ruptures  and quickly recorded a new album entitled Blood on the Tracks in September 1974  152  Dylan delayed the album s release  however  and re recorded half of the songs at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis with production assistance from his brother David Zimmerman  153  Released in early 1975  Blood on the Tracks received mixed reviews  In the NME  Nick Kent described  the accompaniments  as  often so trashy they sound like mere practice takes   154  In Rolling Stone  reviewer Jon Landau wrote that  the record has been made with typical shoddiness   154  However  over the years critics have come to see it as one of Dylan s greatest achievements  perhaps the only serious rival to his mid 1960s trilogy of albums  In Salon com  Bill Wyman wrote   Blood on the Tracks is his only flawless album and his best produced  the songs  each of them  are constructed in disciplined fashion  It is his kindest album and most dismayed  and seems in hindsight to have achieved a sublime balance between the logorrhea plagued excesses of his mid 1960s output and the self consciously simple compositions of his post accident years   155  Novelist Rick Moody called it  the truest  most honest account of a love affair from tip to stern ever put down on magnetic tape   156  Bob Dylan photographed by Elsa Dorfman with Allen Ginsberg  on the Rolling Thunder Revue in 1975 That summer Dylan wrote a lengthy ballad championing the cause of boxer Rubin  Hurricane  Carter  who had been imprisoned for a triple murder committed in Paterson  New Jersey  in 1966  After visiting Carter in jail  Dylan wrote  Hurricane   presenting the case for Carter s innocence  Despite its 8 32 minute length  the song was released as a single  peaking at No 33 on the U S  Billboard Chart  and performed at every 1975 date of Dylan s next tour  the Rolling Thunder Revue  named after the Shoshone medicine man  shaman  teacher  and activist Rolling Thunder  157  158  The tour was a varied evening of entertainment featuring about one hundred performers and supporters drawn from the resurgent Greenwich Village folk scene  including T Bone Burnett  Ramblin  Jack Elliott  Joni Mitchell  159  160 David Mansfield  Roger McGuinn  Mick Ronson  Joan Baez  and violinist Scarlet Rivera  whom Dylan discovered while she was walking down the street  her violin case hanging on her back  161 Allen Ginsberg accompanied the troupe  staging scenes for the film Dylan was simultaneously shooting  Sam Shepard was initially hired to write the film s screenplay  but ended up accompanying the tour as informal chronicler  162  Running through late 1975 and again through early 1976  the tour encompassed the release of the album Desire  with many of Dylan s new songs featuring an almost travelogue like narrative style  showing the influence of his new collaborator  playwright Jacques Levy  163  164  The spring 1976 half of the tour was documented by a TV concert special  Hard Rain  and the LP Hard Rain  no concert album from the better received and better known opening half of the tour was released until 2002 s Live 1975  165  Dylan performing in Rotterdam  June 23  1978 The fall 1975 tour with the Revue also provided the backdrop to Dylan s nearly four hour film Renaldo and Clara  a sprawling and improvised narrative  mixed with concert footage and reminiscences  Released in 1978  the movie received generally poor  sometimes scathing  reviews and had a very brief theatrical run  166  167  Later in that year  Dylan allowed a two hour edit  dominated by the concert performances  to be more widely released  168  In November 1976  Dylan appeared at The Band s  farewell  concert  along with other guests including Joni Mitchell  Muddy Waters  Van Morrison and Neil Young  Martin Scorsese s acclaimed cinematic chronicle of this show  The Last Waltz  was released in 1978 and included about half of Dylan s set  169  In 1976  Dylan also wrote and duetted on the song  Sign Language  for Eric Clapton s No Reason To Cry  170  In 1978  Dylan embarked on a year long world tour  performing 114 shows in Japan  the Far East  Europe and the US  to a total audience of two million people  For the tour  Dylan assembled an eight piece band  and was also accompanied by three backing singers  Concerts in Tokyo in February and March were recorded and released as the live double album  Bob Dylan At Budokan  171  Reviews were mixed  Robert Christgau awarded the album a C  rating  giving the album a derisory review  172  while Janet Maslin defended it in Rolling Stone  writing   These latest live versions of his old songs have the effect of liberating Bob Dylan from the originals   173  When Dylan brought the tour to the US in September 1978  he was dismayed the press described the look and sound of the show as a  Las Vegas Tour   174  The 1978 tour grossed more than  20 million  and Dylan acknowledged to the Los Angeles Times that he had some debts to pay off because  I had a couple of bad years  I put a lot of money into the movie  built a big house     and it costs a lot to get divorced in California   171  In April and May 1978  Dylan took the same large band and backing vocalists into Rundown Studios  a rehearsal space Dylan had rented in Santa Monica  California  to record an album of new material  Street Legal  175  It was described by Michael Gray as   after Blood On The Tracks  arguably Dylan s best record of the 1970s  a crucial album documenting a crucial period in Dylan s own life   176  However  it suffered from poor sound recording and mixing  attributed to Dylan s studio practices   muddying the instrumental detail until a remastered CD release in 1999 restored some of the songs  strengths  177   edit  Born again period Further information  Slow Train Coming  Gotta Serve Somebody  Dylan took five months off at the beginning of 1979 to attend Bible school  28  His subsequent album Slow Train Coming reached No 3 on the U S  Billboard 200 chart and included this Grammy winning song  Problems listening to this file  See media help  In the late 1970s  Dylan became a born again Christian 178  179  180  and released two albums of Christian gospel music  Slow Train Coming  1979  featured the guitar accompaniment of Mark Knopfler  of Dire Straits  and was produced by veteran R amp B producer  Jerry Wexler  Wexler recalled that when Dylan had tried to evangelize him during the recording  he replied   Bob  you re dealing with a sixty two year old Jewish atheist  Let s just make an album   181  The album won Dylan a Grammy Award as  Best Male Vocalist  for the song  Gotta Serve Somebody   The second evangelical album  Saved  1980   received mixed reviews  and was described by Dylan critic Michael Gray as  the nearest thing to a follow up album Dylan has ever made  Slow Train Coming II and inferior   182  When touring from the fall of 1979 through the spring of 1980  Dylan would not play any of his older  secular works  and he delivered declarations of his faith from the stage  such as  Years ago they     said I was a prophet  I used to say   No I m not a prophet  they say  Yes you are  you re a prophet   I said   No it s not me   They used to say  You sure are a prophet   They used to convince me I was a prophet  Now I come out and say Jesus Christ is the answer  They say   Bob Dylan s no prophet   They just can t handle it  183  Dylan s embrace of born again Christianity was unpopular with some of his fans and fellow musicians  184  Shortly before his murder  John Lennon recorded  Serve Yourself  in response to Dylan s  Gotta Serve Somebody   185  By 1981  Stephen Holden wrote in the New York Times that  neither age  he s now 40  nor his much publicized conversion to born again Christianity has altered his essentially iconoclastic temperament   186   edit  1980s Dylan in Barcelona  Spain  1984 In the fall of 1980 Dylan briefly resumed touring for a series of concerts billed as  A Musical Retrospective   where he restored several of his popular 1960s songs to the repertoire  Shot of Love  recorded the next spring  featured Dylan s first secular compositions in more than two years  mixed with explicitly Christian songs  the song  Every Grain of Sand  reminded some critics of William Blake s verses  187  In the 1980s the reception of Dylan s recorded work varied  from the well regarded Infidels in 1983 to the panned Down in the Groove in 1988  Critics such as Michael Gray condemned Dylan s 1980s albums both for showing an extraordinary carelessness in the studio and for failing to release his best songs  188  The Infidels recording sessions  for example  produced several notable songs that Dylan left off the album  Most well regarded of these were  Blind Willie McTell   a tribute to the dead blues musician and an evocation of African American history  189   Foot of Pride  and  Lord Protect My Child   These three songs were later released on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1 3  Rare  amp  Unreleased  1961 1991  190  Between July 1984 and March 1985  Dylan recorded his next studio album  Empire Burlesque  191 Arthur Baker  who had remixed hits for Bruce Springsteen and Cyndi Lauper  was asked to engineer and mix the album  Baker has said he felt he was hired to make Dylan s album sound  a little bit more contemporary   191  Dylan sang on USA for Africa s famine relief fundraising single  We Are the World   On July 13  1985  he appeared at the climax at the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium  Philadelphia  Backed by Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood  Dylan performed a ragged version of  Hollis Brown   his ballad of rural poverty  and then said to the worldwide audience exceeding one billion people   I hope that some of the money     maybe they can just take a little bit of it  maybe     one or two million  maybe     and use it to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and  the farmers here  owe to the banks   192  His remarks were widely criticized as inappropriate  but they did inspire Willie Nelson to organize a series of events  Farm Aid  to benefit debt ridden American farmers  193  In April 1986  Dylan made a brief foray into the world of rap music when he added vocals to the opening verse of  Street Rock   a song featured on Kurtis Blow s album Kingdom Blow  194  Dylan s next studio album  Knocked Out Loaded  was released in July 1986 and contained three cover songs  by Little Junior Parker  Kris Kristofferson and the traditional gospel hymn  Precious Memories    plus three collaborations with other writers  Tom Petty  Sam Shepard and Carole Bayer Sager   and two solo compositions by Dylan  One reviewer commented that  the record follows too many detours to be consistently compelling  and some of those detours wind down roads that are indisputably dead ends  By 1986  such uneven records weren t entirely unexpected by Dylan  but that didn t make them any less frustrating   195  It was the first Dylan album since Freewheelin   1963  to fail to make the Top 50  196  Since then  some critics have called the 11 minute epic that Dylan co wrote with Sam Shepard   Brownsville Girl   a work of genius  197  In 1986 and 1987  Dylan toured extensively with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  sharing vocals with Petty on several songs each night  Dylan also toured with The Grateful Dead in 1987  resulting in a live album Dylan  amp  The Dead  This album received some very negative reviews  Allmusic said   Quite possibly the worst album by either Bob Dylan or the Grateful Dead   198  After performing with these musical permutations  Dylan initiated what came to be called The Never Ending Tour on June 7  1988  performing with a tight back up band featuring guitarist G  E  Smith  Dylan would continue to tour with a small  constantly evolving band for the next 20 years  71  Dylan in Toronto April 18  1980 In 1987  Dylan starred in Richard Marquand s movie Hearts of Fire  in which he played Billy Parker  a washed up rock star turned chicken farmer whose teenage lover  Fiona  leaves him for a jaded English synth pop sensation  played by Rupert Everett   199  Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack  Night After Night   and  I Had a Dream About You  Baby   as well as a cover of John Hiatt s  The Usual   The film was a critical and commercial flop  200  Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988  with Bruce Springsteen s introductory speech declaring   Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body  He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti intellectual  201  When Dylan released the album Down in the Groove in May 1988  it was even more unsuccessful in its sales than his previous studio album  202  Michael Gray wrote   The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within  Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant   203  The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys  Dylan co founded the band with George Harrison  Jeff Lynne  Roy Orbison  and Tom Petty  and in the fall of 1988 their multi platinum Traveling Wilburys Vol  1 reached number three on the US album chart  202  featuring songs that were described as Dylan s most accessible compositions in years  204  Despite Orbison s death in December 1988  the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990  which they released with the unexpected title Traveling Wilburys Vol  3  205  Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with Oh Mercy produced by Daniel Lanois  Dylan critic Michael Gray wrote that the album was   Attentively written  vocally distinctive  musically warm  and uncompromisingly professional  this cohesive whole is the nearest thing to a great Bob Dylan album in the 1980s   203  206  The track  Most of the Time   a lost love composition  was later prominently featured in the film High Fidelity  while  What Was It You Wanted   has been interpreted both as a catechism and a wry comment on the expectations of critics and fans  207  The religious imagery of  Ring Them Bells  struck some critics as a re affirmation of faith  208   edit  1990s Dylan s 1990s began with Under the Red Sky  1990   an about face from the serious Oh Mercy  The album contained several apparently simple songs  including  Under the Red Sky  and  Wiggle Wiggle   The album was dedicated to  Gabby Goo Goo   this was later explained as a nickname for the daughter of Dylan and Carolyn Dennis  Desiree Gabrielle Dennis Dylan  who was four at that time  209 Sidemen on the album included George Harrison  Slash from Guns N  Roses  David Crosby  Bruce Hornsby  Stevie Ray Vaughan  and Elton John  Despite the stellar line up  the record received bad reviews and sold poorly  210  In 1991  Dylan was honored by the recording industry with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award from American actor Jack Nicholson  211  The event coincided with the start of the Gulf War against Saddam Hussein  and Dylan performed his song  Masters of War   212  Dylan then made a short speech that startled some of the audience  212  The next few years saw Dylan returning to his roots with two albums covering old folk and blues numbers  Good as I Been to You  1992  and World Gone Wrong  1993   featuring interpretations and acoustic guitar work  Many critics and fans commented on the quiet beauty of the song  Lone Pilgrim   213  penned by a 19th century teacher and sung by Dylan with a haunting reverence  In November 1994 Dylan recorded two live shows for MTV Unplugged  He claimed his wish to perform a set of traditional songs for the show was overruled by Sony executives who insisted on a greatest hits package  214  The album produced from it  MTV Unplugged  included  John Brown   an unreleased 1963 song detailing the ravages of both war and jingoism  Dylan performs at a 1996 concert in Stockholm With a collection of songs reportedly written while snowed in on his Minnesota ranch  215  Dylan booked recording time with Daniel Lanois at Miami s Criteria Studios in January 1997  The subsequent recording sessions were  by some accounts  fraught with musical tension  216  Late that spring  before the album s release  Dylan was hospitalized with a life threatening heart infection  pericarditis  brought on by histoplasmosis  His scheduled European tour was cancelled  but Dylan made a speedy recovery and left the hospital saying   I really thought I d be seeing Elvis soon   217  He was back on the road by midsummer  and in early fall performed before Pope John Paul II at the World Eucharistic Conference in Bologna  Italy  The Pope treated the audience of 200 000 people to a homily based on Dylan s lyric  Blowin  in the Wind   218  September saw the release of the new Lanois produced album  Time Out of Mind  With its bitter assessment of love and morbid ruminations  Dylan s first collection of original songs in seven years was highly acclaimed  One critic wrote   the songs themselves are uniformly powerful  adding up to Dylan s best overall collection in years   219  This collection of complex songs won him his first solo  Album of the Year  Grammy Award  220  In December 1997  U S  President Bill Clinton presented Dylan with a Kennedy Center Honor in the East Room of the White House  paying this tribute   He probably had more impact on people of my

nominations for several Grammy awards  226  Critics noted that Dylan was widening his musical palette to include rockabilly  Western swing  jazz  and even lounge ballads  227  Love and Theft  generated controversy when The Wall Street Journal pointed out similarities between the album s lyrics and Japanese author Junichi Saga s book Confessions of a Yakuza  228  229  In 2003  Dylan revisited the evangelical songs from his  born again  period and participated in the CD project Gotta Serve Somebody  The Gospel Songs of Bob Dylan  That year also saw the release of the film Masked  amp  Anonymous  which Dylan co wrote with director Larry Charles under the alias Sergei Petrov  230  Dylan played the central character in the film  Jack Fate  alongside a cast which included Jeff Bridges  Penelope Cruz and John Goodman  The film polarised critics  many dismissed it as an  incoherent mess   231  232  a few treated it as a serious work of art  233  234  In October 2004  Dylan published the first part of his autobiography  Chronicles  Volume One  The book confounded expectations  235  Dylan devoted three chapters to his first year in New York City in 1961 1962  virtually ignoring the mid 1960s when his fame was at its height  He also devoted chapters to the albums New Morning  1970  and Oh Mercy  1989   The book reached number two on The New York Times  Hardcover Non

lyrics were quoted by judges and lawyers more than those of any other songwriter  186 times versus 74 by The Beatles  who were second  Among those quoting Dylan were US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia  both conservatives  The most widely cited lines included  you don t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows  from  Subterranean Homesick Blues  and

present day  including contemporary artists as diverse as Blur  Prince  L L  Cool J and The Streets  The show was praised by fans and critics as  great radio   as Dylan told stories and made eclectic references with his sardonic humor  while achieving a thematic beauty with his musical choices  245  246  In April 2009  Dylan broadcast the 100th show in his radio series  the theme was  Goodbye  and the final record played was Woody Guthrie s  So Long  It s Been Good To Know Yuh   This has led to speculation that Dylan s radio series may have ended  247  Dylan  the Spectrum  2007 On August 29  2006  Dylan released his Modern Times album  Despite some coarsening of Dylan s voice  a critic for The Guardian characterised his singing on the album as  a catarrhal death rattle  248   most reviewers praised the album  and many described it as the final installment of a successful trilogy  embracing Time Out of Mind and  Love and Theft   249 Modern Times entered the U S  charts at number

performs at Air Canada Centre  Toronto  November 7  2006 On October 1  2007  Columbia Records released the triple CD retrospective album Dylan  anthologising his entire career under the Dylan 07 logo  260  As part of this campaign  Mark Ronson produced a re mix of Dylan s 1966 tune  Most Likely You Go Your Way  And I ll Go Mine    which was released as a maxi single  This was the first time Dylan had sanctioned a re mix of one of his classic recordings  261  The sophistication of the Dylan 07 marketing campaign was a reminder that Dylan s commercial profile had risen considerably since the 1990s  This first became evidenced in 2004  when Dylan appeared in a TV advertisement for Victoria s Secret lingerie  262  Three years later  in October 2007  he participated in a multi media campaign for the 2008 Cadillac Escalade  263  264  Then  in 2009  he gave the highest profile endorsement of his career  appearing with rapper Will i am in a Pepsi ad that debuted during the telecast of Super

Bromberg and Ralph Stanley  267  The pricing of the album the two CD set went on sale for  18 99 and the three CD version for  129 99 led to complaints about  rip off packaging  from some fans and commentators  268  269  The release was widely acclaimed by critics  270  The abundance of alternative takes and unreleased material suggested to Uncut s reviewer   Tell Tale Signs is awash with evidence of  Dylan s  staggering mercuriality  his evident determination even in the studio to repeat himself as little as possible   271   edit  Together Through Life  Christmas in the Heart  2009  Bob Dylan released his album Together Through Life on April 28  2009  In a conversation with music journalist Bill Flanagan  published on Dylan s website  Dylan explained that the genesis of the record was when French film director Olivier Dahan asked him to supply a song for his new road movie  My Own Love Song  initially only intending to record a single track   Life Is Hard    the record sort of took its own direction   272  Nine of the ten songs on the album are credited as co written by Bob Dylan and Robert Hunter  273  The album received largely favorable reviews  274  although several critics described it as a minor addition to Dylan s canon of work  Andy Gill wrote in The Independent that the record  features Dylan in fairly relaxed  spontaneous mood  content to grab such grooves and sentiments as flit momentarily across his radar  So while it may not contain too many landmark tracks  it s one of the most naturally enjoyable albums you ll hear all year   275  On keyboards at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival  April 28  2006 In its first week of release  the album reached number one in the Billboard 200 chart in the U S   276  making Bob Dylan  67 years of age  the oldest artist to ever debut at number one on that chart  276  It also reached number one on the UK album chart  39 years after Dylan s previous UK album chart topper New Morning  This meant that Dylan currently holds the record for the longest gap between solo number one albums in the UK chart  277  On October 13  2009  Dylan released a Christmas album  Christmas in the Heart  comprising such Christmas standards as  Little Drummer Boy    Winter Wonderland  and  Here Comes Santa Claus   278  Dylan s royalties from the sale of this album will benefit the charities Feeding America in the USA  Crisis in the UK  and the World Food Programme  279  The album received generally favorable reviews  280 The New Yorker commented that Dylan had welded a pre rock musical sound to  some of his croakiest vocals in a while   and speculated that Dylan s intentions might be ironic   Dylan has a long and highly publicized history with Christianity  to claim there s not a wink in the childish optimism of  Here Comes Santa Claus  or  Winter Wonderland  is to ignore a half century of biting satire   281  In USA Today  Edna Gundersen pointed out that Dylan was  revisiting yuletide styles popularized by Nat King Cole  Mel Torm   and the Ray Conniff Singers   Gundersen concluded that Dylan  couldn t sound more sentimental or sincere   282  In an interview published by Street News Service  journalist Bill Flanagan asked Dylan why he had performed the songs in a straightforward style  and Dylan responded   There wasn t any other way to play it  These songs are part of my life  just like folk songs  You have to play them straight too   283   edit  2010s  The Times they are a Changin   Dylan performs  The Times they are a Changin   at a White House celebration of music from

Bootleg Series  The Witmark Demos  This comprised 47 demo recordings of songs taped between 1962 and 1964 for Dylan s earliest music publishers  Leeds Music in 1962  and Witmark Music from 1962 to 1964  One reviewer described the set as  a kind of alternate early history of Dylan s songwriting process   writing five new songs before breakfast   as he once famously quipped   284  The critical aggregator website Metacritic awarded the album a Metascore of 86  indicating  universal acclaim   285  In the same week  Sony Legacy released Bob Dylan  The Original Mono Recordings  a box set which for the first time presented Dylan s eight earliest albums  from Bob Dylan  1962  to John Wesley Harding  1967   in their original mono mix in the CD format  accompanied by new liner notes by Dylan critic Greil Marcus  286  On April 12  2011  Legacy Recordings released Bob Dylan in Concert   Brandeis University 1963   The recording was taped at Brandeis University on May 10  1963  two weeks prior to the release of The Freewheelin  Bob Dylan  The tape had been discovered in the archive of music writer Ralph J  Gleason  and had previously been available as a limited edition supplement to The Bootleg Series Vol  9  The recording carries liner notes by Dylan scholar Michael Gray  who writes    The  Dylan performance it captured  from way back when Kennedy was President and the Beatles hadn t yet reached America  wasn t even on fans  radar     It reveals him not at any Big Moment but giving a performance like his folk club sets of the period    This is the last live performance we have of Bob Dylan before he becomes a star   287  The extent to which his work was studied at an academic level was demonstrated on Dylan s 70th birthday on May 24  2011  when three universities organised symposia on his work  The University of Mainz  288  the University of Vienna  289  and the University of Bristol 290  invited literary critics and cultural historians from Europe and the US to give papers on aspects of Dylan s work  Other events  including tribute bands  intellectual debates and simple singalongs  took place around the world  as reported in The Guardian   From Moscow to Madrid  Norway to Northampton and Malaysia to his home state of Minnesota  self confessed  Bobcats  will gather today to celebrate the 70th birthday of a giant of popular music   291  On October 4  2011  Dylan s label  Egyptian Records  released an album of previously unheard Hank Williams songs  The Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams  Dylan had helped to curate this project  in which songs unfinished when Williams died in 1953 were completed and recorded by a variety of artists  including Dylan himself  his son Jakob Dylan  Levon Helm  Norah Jones  Jack White  and others  292  293  On December 10  2011  to mark International Human Rights Day  Amnesty International announced they would release a 4 CD set  Chimes of Freedom  Songs of Bob Dylan Honoring 50 Years of Amnesty International  to mark the 50th anniversary of the international human rights organization in January 2012  294  The album contains 76 newly recorded cover versions of songs by Dylan  contributed by more than 80 artists  295  Included on the album are  Don t Think Twice  It s All Right  performed by both Kesha and the Kronos Quartet  Pete Townshend performing  Corrina Corrina   Sin ad O Connor performing  Property of Jesus   and Lucinda Williams performing  Tryin  to Get to Heaven   Helen Garrett  director of special projects for Amnesty International  said   Chimes of Freedom is an abundance of riches  It s fair to say that the collection shows how deeply musicians feel about the beauty of Dylan s music across generations and how passionate they are about supporting human rights   295  The 4 CD set of Chimes of Freedom entered the Nielsen SoundScan chart at No  11  and at No  39  as it was also released in a 2 CD version by Starbucks  296   edit  Never Ending Tour Main article  Never Ending Tour Bob Dylan  right on keyboards  at the Roskilde Festival  2006 The Never Ending Tour commenced on June 7  1988  297  and Dylan has played roughly 100 dates a year for the entirety of the 1990s and the 2000s  decade  a heavier schedule than most performers who started out in the 1960s  298  By the end of 2010  Dylan and his band had played more than 2300 shows  299  anchored by long time bassist Tony Garnier  multi instrumentalist Donnie Herron and guitarist Charlie Sexton  To the dismay of some of his audience  300  Dylan s performances remain unpredictable as he alters his arrangements and changes his vocal approach night after night  301  Critical opinion about Dylan s shows remains divided  Critics such as Richard Williams and Andy Gill have argued that Dylan has found a successful way to present his rich legacy of material  302  303  Others have criticised his vocal style as a  one dimensional growl with which he chews up  mangles and spits out the greatest lyrics ever written so that they are effectively unrecognisable   304  and his lack of interest in bonding with his audience  305  Dylan s performances in China in April 2011 generated controversy  Some criticised him for not making any explicit comment on the political situation in China  and for  allegedly  allowing the Chinese authorities to censor his set list  306  307  Others defended Dylan s performances  arguing that such criticism represented a misunderstanding of Dylan s art  and that no evidence for the censorship of Dylan s set list existed  308  309  Dylan responded to these allegations of censorship by posting a statement on his website   As far as censorship goes  the Chinese government had asked for the names of the songs that I would be playing  There s no logical answer to that  so we sent them the set lists from the previous 3 months  If there were any songs  verses or lines censored  nobody ever told me about it and we played all the songs that we intended to play   310  In April 2011  Dylan performed concerts in Taiwan  China  Singapore  Vietnam and Australia  311  He toured Europe  Israel and the US from June to August 2011  commencing in Cork  Ireland  and concluding in Boston  Massachusetts  Accompanied by Mark Knopfler as a supporting act  Dylan undertook a second European tour in October and November  which began in Dublin and ended in London  312   edit  Artist Over a decade after Random House had published Drawn Blank  1994   a book of Dylan s drawings  an exhibit of his art  The Drawn Blank Series  opened in October 2007 at the Kunstsammlungen in Chemnitz  Germany  11  This first public exhibition of Dylan s paintings showcased more than 200 watercolors and gouaches made earlier in 2007 from the original drawings  The exhibition coincided with the publication of the book Bob Dylan  The Drawn Blank Series  which includes 170 reproductions from the series  11  313  10  From September 2010 until April 2011  the National Gallery of Denmark exhibited 40 large scale acrylic paintings by Dylan  The Brazil Series  314  315  In July 2011  a leading contemporary art gallery  Gagosian Gallery  announced their representation of Dylan s paintings  316  An exhibition of Dylan s art  The Asia Series  opened at the Gagosian Madison Avenue Gallery on September 20  displaying Dylan s paintings of scenes in China and the Far East  317 The New York Times reported that  some fans and Dylanologists have raised questions about whether some of these paintings are based on the singer s own experiences and observations  or on photographs that are widely available and were not taken by Mr  Dylan   318 The Times pointed to close resemblances between Dylan s paintings and six historic photos of Japan and China which had been posted on the Flickr website  319  Dylan s paintings also appeared to be based on photographs taken by Dmitri Kessel  Henri Cartier Bresson  and Jacob Aue Sobol  The Magnum photo agency confirmed that Dylan had licensed the reproduction rights of these photographs  320   edit  Discography Main article  Bob Dylan discography The discography lists 34 studio albums  58 singles

January 6  1966  and they had three more children  Anna Lea  born July 11  1967   Samuel Isaac Abraham  born July 30  1968   and Jakob Luke  born December 9  1969   Dylan also adopted Sara s daughter from a prior marriage  Maria Lownds  later Dylan  born October 21  1961   Maria married musician Peter Himmelman in 1988  321  In the 1990s  Dylan s son Jakob became well known as the lead singer of the band The Wallflowers  Jesse Dylan is a film director and a successful businessman  Bob and Sara Dylan were divorced on June 29  1977  322  In June 1986  Dylan married his longtime backup singer Carolyn Dennis  often professionally known as Carol Dennis   323  Their daughter  Desiree Gabrielle Dennis Dylan  was born on January 31  1986  The couple divorced in October 1992  Their marriage and

on the road  325  In total  Bob Dylan has six children  five biological and one adopted  and eleven grandchildren as of 2011   edit  Religious beliefs Growing up in Hibbing  Minnesota  Dylan and his family were part of the area s small but close knit Jewish community  and in May 1954 Dylan had his Bar Mitzvah  326  Around the time of his 30th birthday  in 1971  Dylan visited Israel  and also met Rabbi Meir Kahane  founder of the New York based Jewish Defense League  327 Time Magazine quoted Dylan saying about Kahane   He s a really sincere guy  He s really put it all together   328  Subsequently  Dylan downplayed the extent of his contact with Kahane  329  Dylan touring in the Netherlands  in 1984 For a period during the late 1970s and early 1980s  Dylan was a public convert to Christianity  From January to April 1979  he participated in Bible study classes at the Vineyard School of Discipleship in Reseda  California  Pastor Kenn Gulliksen has recalled   Larry Myers and Paul Emond went over to Bob s house and ministered to him  He responded by saying   Yes he did in fact want Christ in his life   And he prayed that day and received the Lord   330  331  By 1984  Dylan was distancing himself from the  born again  label  He told Kurt Loder of Rolling Stone magazine   I ve never said I m born again  That s just a media term  I don t think I ve been an agnostic  I ve always thought there s a superior power  that this is not the real world and that there s a world to come   In response to Loder s asking whether he belonged to any Church or synagogue  Dylan laughingly replied   Not really  Uh  the Church of the Poison Mind   332  In 1997 he told David Gates of Newsweek    Here s the thing with me and the religious thing  This is the flat out truth  I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music  I don t find it anywhere else  Songs like  Let Me Rest on a Peaceful Mountain  or  I Saw the Light  that s my religion  I don t adhere to rabbis  preachers  evangelists  all of that  I ve learned more from the songs than I ve learned from any of this kind of entity  The songs are my lexicon  I believe the songs  1    In an interview published in The New York Times on September 28  1997  journalist Jon Pareles reported that  Dylan says he now subscribes to no organized religion   333  Dylan has been a supporter of the Chabad Lubavitch movement in the last 20 years  334  and has privately participated in Jewish religious events  including the bar mitzvahs of his sons and attending Hadar Hatorah  a Chabad Lubavitch yeshiva  In September 1989 and September 1991  Dylan appeared on the Chabad telethon  335  Dylan reportedly visits Chabad synagogues  on September 22  2007  Yom Kippur   he attended Congregation Beth Tefillah  in Atlanta  Georgia  where he was called to the Torah for the sixth aliyah  336  Dylan has continued to perform songs from his gospel albums in concert  occasionally covering traditional religious songs  He has also made passing references to his religious faith such as in a 2004 interview with 60 Minutes  when he told Ed Bradley that  the only person you have to think twice about lying to is either yourself or to God   He also explained his constant touring schedule as part of a bargain he made a long time ago with the  chief commander in this earth and in the world we can t see   33  In a 2009 interview with Bill Flanagan promoting his Christmas LP  Christmas in the Heart  Flanagan commented on the  heroic performance  Dylan gave of  O Little Town of Bethlehem  and that Dylan  delivered the song like a true believer   Dylan replied   Well  I am a true believer   283   edit  Legacy Bob Dylan is one of the most influential figures of the 20th century  musically and culturally  Dylan was included in the Time 100  The Most Important People of the Century where he was called  master poet  caustic social critic and intrepid  guiding spirit of the counterculture generation   2  Biographer Howard Sounes placed him among the most exalted company when he said   There are giant figures in art who are sublimely good Mozart  Picasso  Frank Lloyd Wright  Shakespeare  Dickens  Dylan ranks alongside these artists   337 Colin Larkin ranked Dylan at number two in his  Top 50 Artists Of All Time   a ranking based on the cumulative votes for each artist s albums that appear in Larkin s All Time Top 1000 Albums  338  Initially modeling his writing style on the songs of Woody Guthrie  6  and lessons learned from the blues of Robert Johnson  7  Dylan added increasingly sophisticated lyrical techniques to the folk music of the early 1960s  infusing it  with the intellectualism of classic literature and poetry   339 Paul Simon suggested that Dylan s early compositions virtually took over the folk genre    Dylan s  early songs were very rich     with strong melodies   Blowin  in the Wind  has a really strong melody  He so enlarged himself through the folk background that he incorporated it for a while  He defined the genre for a while   340  When Dylan made his move from acoustic music to a rock backing  the mix became more complex  For many critics  Dylan s greatest achievement was the cultural synthesis exemplified by his mid 1960s trilogy of albums Bringing It All Back Home  Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde  In Mike Marqusee s words   Between late 1964 and the summer of 1966  Dylan created a body of work that remains unique  Drawing on folk  blues  country  R amp B  rock n roll  gospel  British beat  symbolist  modernist and Beat poetry  surrealism and Dada  advertising jargon and social commentary  Fellini and Mad magazine  he forged a coherent and original artistic voice and vision  The beauty of these albums retains the power to shock and console   341  One legacy of Dylan s verbal sophistication was the increasing attention paid by literary critics to his lyrics  Professor Christopher Ricks published a 500 page analysis of Dylan s work  placing him in the context of Eliot  Keats and Tennyson  342  and claiming that Dylan was a poet worthy of the same close and painstaking analysis  343  Former British poet laureate  Andrew Motion  argued that Bob Dylan s lyrics should be studied in schools  344  Since 1996  academics have lobbied the Swedish Academy to award Dylan the Nobel Prize in Literature  345  346  347  348  Dylan s voice was  in some ways  as startling as his lyrics  New York Times critic Robert Shelton described Dylan s early vocal style as  a rusty voice suggesting Guthrie s old performances  etched in gravel like Dave Van Ronk s   349 David Bowie  in his tribute   Song for Bob Dylan   described Dylan s singing as  a voice like sand and glue   Dylan s voice continued to develop as he began to work with rock n roll backing bands  critic Michael Gray described the sound of Dylan s vocal on his hit single   Like a Rolling Stone   as  at once young and jeeringly cynical   350  As Dylan s voice aged during the 1980s  for some critics  it became more expressive  Christophe Lebold writes in the journal Oral Tradition   Dylan s more recent broken voice enables him to present a world view at the sonic surface of the songs this voice carries us across the landscape of a broken  fallen world  The anatomy of a broken world in  Everything is Broken   on the album Oh Mercy  is but an example of how the thematic concern with all things broken is grounded in a concrete sonic reality   351  Dylan s influence has been felt in several musical genres  As Edna Gundersen stated in USA Today   Dylan s musical DNA has informed nearly every simple twist of pop since 1962   352  Many musicians have testified to Dylan s influence  such as Joe Strummer  who praised Dylan as having  laid down the template for lyric  tune  seriousness  spirituality  depth of rock music   353  Other major musicians to have acknowledged Dylan s importance include John Lennon  354 Paul McCartney  355 Pete Townshend  356 Neil Young  357 Bruce Springsteen  98 David Bowie  358 Bryan Ferry  359 Nick Cave  360  361 Patti Smith  362 Syd Barrett  363 Cat Stevens  364 Joni Mitchell  365  and Tom Waits  366  More directly  both The Byrds and The Band  two 1960s contemporary groups with some measure of influence on popular music themselves  largely owed their initial success to Dylan  the Byrds with their hit of  Mr  Tambourine Man  and subsequent album  and The Band for their association with him on tour in 1966  on retreat in Woodstock  and on their debut album featuring three previously unreleased Dylan songs  There have been dissenters as to opinion of Dylan s legacy and influence  Due to the fact that Dylan was widely credited with imbuing pop culture with a new seriousness  the critic Nik Cohn objected   I can t take the vision of Dylan as seer  as teenage messiah  as everything else he s been worshipped as  The way I see him  he s a minor talent with a major gift for self hype   367  Similarly  Australian critic Jack Marx credited Dylan with changing the persona of the rock star   What cannot be disputed is that Dylan invented the arrogant  faux cerebral posturing that has been the dominant style in rock since  with everyone from Mick Jagger to Eminem educating themselves from the Dylan handbook   368 Joni Mitchell described Dylan as a  plagiarist  and his voice as  fake  in a 2010 interview in the Los Angeles Times  in response to a suggestion that she and Dylan were similar since they had both changed their birthnames  369  370  Mitchell s comment led to discussions of Dylan s use of other people s material  both supporting and criticizing Dylan  371  If Bob Dylan s legacy in the 1960s was seen as bringing intellectual ambition to popular music  now that he has reached the age of 70  he has been described as a figure who has greatly expanded the folk culture from which he initially emerged  As J  Hoberman wrote in The Village Voice   Elvis might never have been born  but someone else would surely have brought the world rock  n  roll  No such logic accounts for Bob Dylan  No iron law of history demanded that a would be Elvis from Hibbing  Minnesota  would swerve through the Greenwich Village folk revival to become the world s first and greatest rock  n  roll beatnik bard and then having achieved fame and adoration beyond reckoning vanish into a folk tradition of his own making   372   edit  Notes   According to Dylan biographer Robert Shelton  the singer first confided his change of name to his high school girlfriend Echo Helstrom in 1958  informing her he had found a  great name  Bob Dillon   Shelton surmises the name Dillon had two sources  Marshal Matt Dillon was the hero of the popular TV western Gunsmoke  Dillon was also the name of one of Hibbing s principal families  When writing his biography in the mid 1960s  Dylan told Shelton   Straighten out in your book that I did not take my name from Dylan Thomas  Dylan Thomas s poetry is for people that aren t really satisfied in their bed  for people who dig masculine romance   At the University of Minnesota  the singer told a few friends that Dillon was his mother s maiden name  which was untrue  The singer later told reporters that he had an uncle named Dillon  Shelton adds that only when he reached New York in 1961 did the singer begin to spell his name  Dylan   by which time he was acquainted with the life and work of Dylan Thomas  Shelton  No Direction Home  2011  pp  44 45   edit  Footnotes   a b c Gates  David  October 6  1997    Dylan Revisited   Newsweek
