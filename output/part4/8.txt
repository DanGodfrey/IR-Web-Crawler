Kurtzberg  was an American comic book artist  writer and editor regarded by historians and fans as one of the major innovators and most influential creators in the comic book medium  Growing up poor in New York City  Kurtzberg entered the nascent comics industry in the 1930s  He drew various comics features under different pen names  including Jack Curtiss  ultimately settling on Jack Kirby  In 1940  he and writer editor Joe Simon created the highly successful superhero character Captain America for Timely Comics  predecessor of Marvel Comics  During the 1940s  Kirby  generally teamed with Simon  created numerous characters for that company and for the company that would become DC Comics  After serving in World War II  Kirby returned to comics and worked in a variety of genres  He contributed to a number of publishers  including DC  Harvey Comics  Hillman Periodicals and Crestwood Publications  where he and Simon created the genre of romance comics  He and Simon also launched their own short lived comic company  Mainline Publications  Kirby ultimately found himself at Timely s 1950s iteration  Atlas Comics  later to be known as Marvel Comics  There  in the 1960s  he and writer editor Stan Lee co created many of Marvel s major characters  including the Fantastic Four  the X Men  and the Hulk  Despite the high sales and critical acclaim of the Lee Kirby titles  however  Kirby felt treated unfairly  and left the company in 1970 for rival DC  There Kirby created his Fourth World saga  which spanned several comics titles  While these series proved commercially unsuccessful and were canceled  several of their characters and the Fourth World mythos have continued as a significant part of the DC Comics universe  Kirby returned to Marvel briefly in the mid to

Life and career  edit  Early life  1917 1935  Jack Kirby was born Jacob Kurtzberg on August 28  1917  on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City  where he was raised  4  5  6  His parents  Rose and Benjamin Kurtzberg  5  were Austrian Jewish immigrants  and his father earned a living as a garment factory worker  7  In his youth  Kirby desired to escape his neighborhood  He liked to draw and sought out places he could learn more about art  8  Essentially self taught  9  Kirby cited among his influences the comic strip artists Milton Caniff  Hal Foster  and Alex Raymond  as well as such editorial cartoonists as C  H  Sykes   Ding  Darling  and Rollin Kirby  9  He was rejected by the Educational Alliance because he drew  too fast with charcoal   according to Kirby  He later found an outlet for his skills by drawing cartoons for the newspaper of the Boys Brotherhood Republic  a  miniature city  on East 3rd Street where street kids ran their own government  10  Kirby enrolled at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn  at what he said was age 14  leaving after a week   I wasn t the kind of student that Pratt was looking for  They wanted people who would work on something forever  I didn t want to work on any project forever  I intended to get things done   11   edit  Entry into comics  1936 1940  Captain America Comics  1  cover dated March 1941   Cover art by Kirby  amp  Joe Simon  Per his sometimes unreliable memory  Kirby joined the Lincoln Newspaper Syndicate in 1936  working there on newspaper comic strips and on single panel advice cartoons such as Your Health Comes First     under the pseudonym Jack Curtiss   He remained until late 1939  when he began working for the movie animation company Fleischer Studios as an inbetweener  an artist who fills in the action between major movement frames  on Popeye cartoons   I went from Lincoln to Fleischer   he recalled   From Fleischer I had to get out in a hurry because I couldn t take that kind of thing   describing it as  a factory in a sense  like my father s factory  They were manufacturing pictures   12  Around that time  the American comic book industry was booming  Kirby began writing and drawing for the comic book packager Eisner  amp  Iger  one of a handful of firms creating comics on demand for publishers  Through that company  Kirby did what he remembers as his first comic book work  for Wild Boy Magazine  13  This included such strips as the science fiction adventure  The Diary of Dr  Hayward   under the pseudonym Curt Davis   the Western crimefighter feature  Wilton of the West   as Fred Sande   the swashbuckler adventure  The Count of Monte Cristo   again as Jack Curtiss   and the humor features  Abdul Jones   as Ted Grey  and   Socko the Seadog   as Teddy   all variously for Jumbo Comics and other Eisner Iger clients  14  He ultimately settled on the pen name Jack Kirby because it reminded him of actor James Cagney  However  he took offense to those who suggested he changed his name in order to hide his Jewish heritage  15  In the summer of 1940  Kirby and his family moved to Brooklyn  There  Kirby met Rosalind  Roz  Goldstein  who lived in the same apartment building  The pair began dating soon afterward  16  Kirby proposed to Goldstein on her eighteenth birthday  and the two became engaged  17   edit  Partnership with Joe Simon Kirby moved on to comic book publisher and newspaper syndicator Fox Feature Syndicate  earning a then reasonable  15 a week salary  He began exploring superhero narrative with the comic strip The Blue Beetle  published January to March 1940  starring a character created by the pseudonymous Charles Nicholas  a house name that Kirby retained for the three month long strip  During this time  Kirby met and began collaborating with cartoonist and Fox editor Joe Simon  who in addition to his staff work continued to freelance  Simon recalled in 1988   I loved Jack s work and the first time I saw it I couldn t believe what I was seeing  He asked if we could do some freelance work together  I was delighted and I took him over to my little office  We worked from the second issue of Blue Bolt     18  After leaving Fox and landing at pulp magazine publisher Martin Goodman s Timely Comics  the future Marvel Comics   Simon and Kirby created the patriotic superhero Captain America in late 1940  Simon cut a deal with Goodman that gave him and Kirby 15 percent of the profits from the feature citation needed  as well as salaried positions as the company s editor and art director  respectively  citation needed  The first issue of Captain America Comics  released in early 1941  sold out in days  and the second issue s print run was set at over a million copies  The title s success established the team as a notable creative force in the industry  19  After the first issue was published  Simon asked Kirby to join the Timely staff as the company s art director  20  With the success of the Captain America character  Simon felt that Goodman was not paying the pair the promised percentage of profits  and so sought work for the two of them at National Comics  later named DC Comics   21  Kirby and Simon negotiated a deal that would pay them a combined  500 a week  as opposed to the  75 and  85 they respectively earned at Timely  22  Fearing that Goodman would not pay them if he found out they were moving to National  the pair kept the deal a secret while they continued producing work for the company  Goodman eventually learned of their plans  and Kirby and Simon left after completing their work on Captain America Comics  10  23  Kirby and Simon spent their first weeks at National trying to devise new characters while the company sought how best to utilize the pair  24  After a few failed editor assigned ghosting assignments  National s Jack Liebowitz told them to  just do what you want   The pair then revamped the Sandman feature in Adventure Comics and created the superhero Manhunter  25  26  In July 1942 they began the Boy Commandos feature  The ongoing  kid gang  series Boy Commandos  launched later that same year was the creative team s first National feature to graduate into its own title  27  sold over a million copies a month  becoming National s third best selling title  28  They also scored a hit with the homefront kid gang team  the Newsboy Legion  in Star Spangled Comics  29   edit  Marriage and World War II  1943 1945  Kirby married Roz Goldstein on May 23  1942  30  The same year that he married  he changed his name legally from Jacob Kurtzberg to Jack Kirby  citation needed  With World War II underway  Liebowitz expected that Simon and Kirby would be drafted  so he asked the artists to create an inventory of material to be published in their absence  The pair hired writers  inkers  letterers  and colorists in order to create a year s worth of material  28  Kirby was drafted into the U S  Army on June 7  1943  31  After basic training at Camp Stewart  near Atlanta  Georgia  he was assigned to Company F of the 11th Infantry  32  He landed on Omaha Beach in Normandy on August 23  1944  two and a half months after D Day  32  though Kirby s reminiscences would place his arrival just 10 days after  31  Kirby recalled that a lieutenant  learning that comics artist Kirby was in his command  made him a scout who would advance into towns and draw reconnaissance maps and pictures  an extremely dangerous duty  33  Kirby and his wife corresponded regularly by v mail  with Roz sending  him a letter a day  while she worked in a lingerie shop and lived with her mother 34  at 2820 Brighton 7th Street in Brooklyn  35  During the winter of 1944  Kirby suffered severe frostbite on his lower extremities and was taken to a hospital in London  England  for recovery  Doctors considered amputating Kirby s legs  but he eventually recovered from the frostbite  36  He returned to the United States in January 1945  assigned to Camp Butner in North Carolina  where he spent the last six months of his service as part of the motor pool  Kirby was honorably discharged as a Private First Class on July 20  1945  having received a Combat Infantryman Badge and a European African Middle Eastern Theater ribbon with a bronze battle star  37  38   edit  Postwar career  1946 1955  Young Romance  1  Oct  1947   Cover art by Kirby  amp  Simon  Kirby s first daughter  Susan  was born on December 6  1945  Simon arranged for work for Kirby and himself at Harvey Comics  39  where  through the early 1950s  the duo created such titles as the kid gang adventure Boy Explorers Comics  the kid gang Western Boys  Ranch  the superhero comic Stuntman  and  in vogue with the fad for 3 D movies  Captain 3 D  Simon and Kirby additionally freelanced for Hillman Periodicals  the crime fiction comic Real Clue Crime  and for Crestwood Publications  Justice Traps the Guilty   14  The team found its greatest success in the postwar period by creating romance comics  Simon  inspired by Macfadden Publications  romantic confession magazine True Story  transplanted the idea to comic books and with Kirby created a first issue mock up of Young Romance  40  Showing it to Crestwood general manager Maurice Rosenfeld  Simon asked for 50  of the comic s profits  Crestwood publishers Teddy Epstein and Mike Bleier agreed  40  stipulating that the creators would take no money up front  41 Young Romance  1  cover date Oct  1947   became Jack and Joe s biggest hit in years   42  Indeed  the pioneering title sold a staggering 92  of its print run  inspiring Crestwood to increase the print run by the third issue to triple the initial number of copies  43  Initially published bimonthly  Young Romance quickly became a monthly title and produced the spin off Young Love together the two titles sold two million copies per month  according to Simon 44  later joined by Young Brides and In Love  the latter  featuring full length romance stories   43 Young Romance spawned dozens of imitators from publishers such as Timely  Fawcett  Quality  and Fox Feature Syndicate  42  Despite the glut  the Simon  amp  Kirby romance titles continued to sell millions of copies a month  which allowed Kirby to buy a house for his family in Mineola  Long Island  New York  42  Kirby s second child  Neal  was born in May 1948  42  His third child  Barbara  was born in November 1952  45  Bitter that Timely Comics  1950s iteration  Atlas Comics  had relaunched Captain America in a new series in 1954  Kirby and Simon created Fighting American  Simon recalled   We thought we d show them how to do Captain America   46  While the comic book initially portrayed the protagonist as an anti Communist dramatic hero  Simon and Kirby turned the series into a superhero satire with the second issue  in the aftermath of the Army McCarthy hearings and the public backlash against the Red baiting U S  Senator Joseph McCarthy  47   edit  After Simon  1956 1957  Sky Masters by Kirby  amp  Wally Wood  At the urging of a Crestwood salesman  Kirby and Simon launched their own comics company  Mainline Publications  47  48  securing a distribution deal with Leader News 49  in late 1953 or early 1954  subletting space from their friend Al Harvey s Harvey Publications at 1860 Broadway  50  Mainline  which existed from 1954 to 1955  published four titles  the Western Bullseye  Western Scout  the war comic Foxhole  since EC Comics and Atlas Comics were having success with war comics  but promoting theirs as as being written and drawn by actual veterans  In Love  since their earlier romance comic Young Love was still being widely imitated  and the crime comic Police Trap  which claimed to be based on genuine accounts by law enforcement officials  51  After the duo rearranged and republished artwork from an old Crestwood story in In Love  Crestwood refused to pay the team  52  who sought an audit of Crestwood s finances  Upon review  the pair s attorney s stated the company owed them  130 000 for work done over the past seven years  Crestwood paid them  10 000 in addition to their recent delayed payments  However  the partnership between Kirby and Simon had become strained  53  Simon left the industry for a career in advertising  while Kirby continued to freelance   He wanted to do other things and I stuck with comics   Kirby recalled in 1971   It was fine  There was no reason to continue the partnership and we parted friends   54  At this point in the mid 1950s  Kirby made a temporary return to the former Timely Comics  now known as Atlas Comics  the direct predecessor of Marvel Comics  Inker Frank Giacoia had approached editor in chief Stan Lee for work and suggested he could  get Kirby back here to pencil some stuff   55  While also freelancing for National Comics  the future DC Comics  Kirby drew 20 stories for Atlas from 1956 to 1957  Beginning with the five page  Mine Field  in Battleground  14  Nov 1956   Kirby penciled and in some cases also inked  with his wife  Roz  and wrote stories of the Western hero Black Rider  the Fu Manchu like Yellow Claw  and more  14  56  But in 1957  distribution troubles caused the  Atlas implosion  that resulted in several series being dropped and no new material being assigned for many months  It would be the following year before Kirby returned to the nascent Marvel  For DC around this time  Kirby co created with writers Dick and Dave Wood the non superpowered adventuring quartet the Challengers of the Unknown in Showcase  6  Feb  1957   while also contributing to such anthologies as House of Mystery  14  During 30 months freelancing for DC  Kirby drew slightly more than 600 pages  which included 11 six page Green Arrow stories in World s Finest Comics and Adventure Comics that  in a rarity  Kirby inked himself  57  Kirby recast the archer as a science fiction hero  moving him away from his Batman formula roots  but in the process alienating Green Arrow co creator Mort Weisinger  58  He also began drawing a newspaper comic strip  Sky Masters of the Space Force  written by the Wood brothers and initially inked by the unrelated Wally Wood  59  Kirby left National Comics due largely to a contractual dispute in which editor Jack Schiff  who had been involved in getting Kirby and the Wood brothers the Sky Masters contract  claimed he was due royalties from Kirby s share of the strip s profits  Schiff successfully sued Kirby  60  Some DC editors also had criticized him over art details  such as not drawing  the shoelaces on a cavalryman s boots  and showing a Native American  mounting his horse from the wrong side   61   edit  Marvel Comics in the Silver Age  1958 1970  One of comics  most iconic covers  The Avengers  4  March 1964   Art by Kirby  amp  George Roussos  Several months later  after his split with DC  Kirby began freelancing regularly for Atlas  Because of the poor page rates  Kirby would spend 12 to 14 hours daily at his drawing table at home  producing eight to ten pages of artwork a day  62  His first published work at Atlas was the cover of and the seven page story  I Discovered the Secret of the Flying Saucers  in Strange Worlds  1  Dec  1958   Initially with Christopher Rule as his regular inker  and later Dick Ayers  Kirby drew across all genres  from romance comics to war comics to crime comics to Westerns  but made his mark primarily with a series of supernatural fantasy and science fiction stories featuring giant  drive in movie style monsters with names like Groot  the Thing from Planet X  Grottu  King of the Insects  and Fin Fang Foom for the company s many anthology series  such as Amazing Adventures  Strange Tales  Tales to Astonish  Tales of Suspense  and World of Fantasy  14  His bizarre designs of powerful  unearthly creatures proved a hit with readers  Additionally  he also freelanced for Archie Comics  around this time  reuniting briefly with Joe Simon to help develop the series The Fly and The Double Life of Private Strong  Additionally  Kirby drew some issues of Classics Illustrated  14  It was at Marvel  however  with writer and editor in chief Lee  that Kirby hit his stride once again in superhero comics  beginning with The Fantastic Four  1  Nov  1961   14  The landmark series became a hit that revolutionized the industry with its comparative naturalism and  eventually  a cosmic purview informed by Kirby s seemingly boundless imagination   one well matched with the consciousness expanding youth culture of the 1960s  For almost a decade  Kirby provided Marvel s house style  co creating with Stan Lee many of the Marvel characters and designing their visual motifs  At Lee s request  he often provided new to Marvel artists  breakdown  layouts  over which they would pencil in order to become acquainted with the Marvel look  As artist Gil Kane described  Jack was the single most influential figure in the turnaround in Marvel s fortunes from the time he rejoined the company     It wasn t merely that Jack conceived most of the characters that are being done  but     Jack s point of view and philosophy of drawing became the governing philosophy of the entire publishing company and  beyond the publishing company  of the entire field      Marvel took  Jack and use d  him as a primer  They would get artists     and they taught them the ABCs  which amounted to learning Jack Kirby      Jack was like the Holy Scripture and they simply had to follow him without deviation  That s what was told to me     It was how they taught everyone to reconcile all those opposing attitudes to one single master point of view  63  Highlights other than the Fantastic Four include  Thor  the Hulk  Iron Man  the original X Men  the Silver Surfer  Doctor Doom  Galactus  Uatu the Watcher  Magneto  Ego the Living Planet  the Inhumans and their hidden city of Attilan  and the Black Panther   comics  first known black superhero   and his African nation of Wakanda  Simon and Kirby s Captain America was also incorporated into Marvel s continuity with Kirby approving Lee s idea citation needed  of partially remaking the character as a man out of his time and regretting the death of his sidekick  In 1968 and 1969  Joe Simon was involved in litigation with Marvel Comics over the ownership of Captain America  initiated by Marvel after Simon registered the copyright renewal for Captain America in his own name  According to Simon  Kirby agreed to support the company in the litigation and  as part of a deal Kirby made with publisher Martin Goodman  signed over to Marvel any rights he might have had to the character  64  Kirby continued to expand the medium s boundaries  devising photo collage covers and interiors  developing new drawing techniques such as the method for depicting energy fields now known as  Kirby Dots   and other experiments  65  Yet he grew increasingly dissatisfied with working at Marvel  There have been a number of reasons given for this dissatisfaction  including resentment over Stan Lee s increasing media prominence  a lack of full creative control  anger over breaches of perceived promises by publisher Martin Goodman  and frustration over Marvel s failure to credit him specifically for his story plotting and for his character creations and co creations  66  He began to both script and draw some secondary features for Marvel  such as  The Inhumans  in Amazing Adventures  as well as horror stories for the anthology title Chamber of Darkness  and received full credit for doing so  but in 1970 he eventually left the company  where he was earning  35 000 a year  67  for rival DC Comics  under editorial director Carmine Infantino   edit  DC Comics and the Fourth World saga  1971 1975  The New Gods  1  March 1971  Cover art by Kirby  amp  Don Heck  Kirby spent nearly two years negotiating a deal to move to DC Comics  68  where in late 1970 he signed a three year contract with an option for two additional years  69  He produced a series of interlinked titles under the blanket sobriquet  The Fourth World   which included a trilogy of new titles   New Gods  Mister Miracle  and The Forever People   as well as the extant Superman s Pal Jimmy Olsen  14  70  Kirby picked the latter book because the series was without a stable creative team and he did not want to cost anyone a job  71  72  The central villain of the Fourth World series  Darkseid  and some of the Fourth World concepts  appeared in Jimmy Olsen before the launch of the other Fourth World books  giving the new titles greater exposure to potential buyers  An attempt at creating new formats for comics produced the one shot black and white magazines Spirit World and In the Days of the Mob in 1971  73  Kirby later produced other DC features such as OMAC  74 Kamandi  75 The Demon  76   The Losers   77   Dingbats of Danger Street   Kobra and  together with former partner Joe Simon for one last time  a new incarnation of the Sandman  14  78   edit  Return to Marvel  1976 1978  At the comic book convention Marvelcon  75  in spring 1975  Stan Lee used a Fantastic Four panel discussion to announce that Kirby was returning to Marvel after having left in 1970 to work for DC Comics  Lee wrote in his monthly column   Stan Lee s Soapbox   that   I mentioned that I had a special announcement to make  As I started telling about Jack s return  to a totally incredulous audience  everyone s head started to snap around as Kirby himself came waltzin  down the aisle to join us on the rostrum  You can imagine how it felt clownin  around with the co creator of most of Marvel s greatest strips once more   79  Back at Marvel  Kirby both wrote and drew Captain America and created the series The Eternals  which featured a race of inscrutable alien giants  the Celestials  whose behind the scenes intervention in primordial humanity would eventually become a core element of Marvel Universe continuity  Kirby s other Marvel creations in this period include Devil Dinosaur  Machine Man  and an adaptation and expansion of the movie 2001  A Space Odyssey  as well as an abortive attempt to do the same for the classic television series  The Prisoner  80  He also wrote and drew Black Panther and did numerous covers across the line  14   edit  Film and animation  1979 1980  Still dissatisfied

made a then groundbreaking deal with Kirby to publish a creator owned series  Captain Victory and the Galactic Rangers  83  and the six issue miniseries Silver Star  which was collected in hardcover format in 2007  84  85  86  This  together with similar actions by other independent comics publishers as Eclipse Comics  where Kirby co created Destroyer Duck in a benefit comic book series published to help Steve Gerber fight a legal case versus Marvel   87  helped establish a precedent to end the monopoly of the work for hire system  wherein comics creators  even freelancers  had owned no rights to characters they created  Though estranged from Marvel  Kirby continued to do periodic work for DC Comics during the 1980s  including a brief revival of his  Fourth World  saga in the 1984 and 1985 Super Powers miniseries and the 1985 graphic novel The Hunger Dogs  And in 1987  under pressure from comics creators and the fan community  Marvel finally returned approximately 2 100 pages 88  of the

storytelling and a cinematic style of motion  Once wooden characters cascaded from one frame to another or even from page to page threatening to fall right out of the book into the reader s lap  The force of punches thrown was visibly and explosively evident  Even at rest  a Kirby character pulsed with tension and energy in a way that makes movie versions of the same characters seem static by comparison  106  Michael Chabon  in his afterword to his Pulitzer Prize winning novel The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier  amp  Clay  a fictional account of two early comics pioneers  wrote   I want to

Fourth World Omnibus  Volume 1  New York  DC Comics  2007    McAvennie  1970s  in Dolan  p  141  Since no ongoing creative team had been slated to Superman s Pal  Jimmy Olsen   King of Comics  Jack Kirby made the title his DC launch point  and the writer artist s indelible energy and ideas permeated every panel and word balloon of the comic     McAvennie  1970s  in Dolan  p  147   Believing that new formats were necessary for the comics medium to continue evolving  Kirby oversaw the production of what was labeled his  Speak Out Series  of magazines  Spirit World and In the Days of the Mob   Sadly  these unique magazines never found their desired audience     McAvennie  1970s  in Dolan  p  161  In OMAC s first issue  editor writer artist Jack Kirby warned readers of  The World That s Coming    a future world containing wild concepts that are almost frighteningly real today     McAvennie  1970s  in Dolan  p  153  Kirby had already introduced a similar concept and characters in Alarming Tales  1  1957    Coupling the premise with his unpublished  Kamandi of the Caves  newspaper strip  Kirby s Last Boy on Earth roamed a world that had been ravaged by the  Great Disaster  and taken over by talking animals     McAvennie  1970s  in Dolan  p  152  While his  Fourth World  opus was winding down  Jack Kirby was busy conjuring his next creation  which emerged not from the furthest reaches of the galaxy but from the deepest pits of Hell  Etrigan was hardly the usual Kirby protagonist     McAvennie  1970s  in Dolan  p  161  Jack Kirby also took on a group of established DC characters that had nothing to lose  The result was a year long run of Our Fighting Forces tales that were action packed  personal  and among the most beloved of World War II comics ever produced     McAvennie  1970s  in Dolan  p  158  The legendary tandem of writer Joe Simon and artist editor Jack Kirby reunited for a one shot starring the Sandman   Despite the issue s popularity  it would be
