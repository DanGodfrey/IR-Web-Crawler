Scenes  in Savage Tales  1  May 1971   the black and white adventure fantasy magazine in which the character debuted in an 11 page origin story  Man Thing was conceived in discussions between Marvel Comics editor Stan Lee and writer Roy Thomas  and that together they created five possible origins  Lee provided the name  which had previously been used for unrelated creatures in Marvel s early science fiction fantasy anthology Tales of Suspense  7  Jan  1960  and  81  3  4  as well as the concept of the man losing sentience  As Thomas recalled in 2002  Stan Lee called me in  it would ve been late  70 or early  71        He had a couple of sentences or so for the concept   I think it was mainly the notion of a guy working on some experimental drug or something for the government  his being accosted by spies  and getting fused with the swamp so that he becomes this creature  The creature itself sounds a lot like the Heap  but neither of us mentioned that character at the time     I didn t care much for the name  Man Thing   because we already had the Thing  of the superhero team the Fantastic Four   and I thought it would be confusing to also have another one called Man Thing  5  Thomas worked out a detailed plot 6  and gave it to Gerry Conway to script  Thomas and Conway are credited as writers  with Gray Morrow as artist  A second story  written by Len Wein and drawn by Neal Adams  was prepared at that time  but  upon Savage Tales  cancellation after that single issue  7   took a year or two to see print   according to Thomas  8  That occurred in Astonishing Tales  12  June 1972   in which the seven page story was integrated in its entirety within the 21 page feature  Ka Zar   starring Marvel s jungle lord hero  This black and white interlude  with yellow highlighting  segued to Man Thing s introduction to color comics as Ka Zar s antagonist turned ally in this and the following issue  both written by Thomas  with the first penciled by John Buscema and the second by Buscema and Rich Buckler   The Wein written Man Thing story appeared in between Wein s first 9  and second 10  version of his DC Comics character Swamp Thing  Wein was Conway s roommate at the time  and as Thomas recalled in 2008  Gerry and I thought that  unconsciously  the origin in Swamp Thing  1 was a bit too similar to the origin of Man Thing a year and a half earlier  There was vague talk at the time around Marvel of legal action  but it was never really pursued  I don t know if any letters even changed hands between Marvel and DC        We weren t happy with the situation over the Swamp Thing  1 origin  but we figured it was an accident  Gerry was rooming with Len at the time and tried to talk him into changing the Swamp Thing s origin  Len didn t see the similarities  so he went ahead with what he was going to do  The two characters verged off after that origin  so it didn t make much difference  anyway  11  Steve Gerber would refer to Man Thing as an  Un Man   eponymous with enemies of Swamp Thing  in Fear  12  Man Thing received his own 10 page feature  again by Conway  with Morrow inking pencils by Howard Chaykin   in Adventure into Fear  10  Oct  1972   sharing that anthological title with reprinted 1950s horror fantasy stories  Steve Gerber  who would become Man Thing s signature writer  succeeded Conway the following issue  with art by Rich Buckler  Mayerik began with issue  13   The feature expanded to 15 pages with  12  art by Jim Starlin   became 16 pages two issues later  and reached the then standard 19 page length of Marvel superhero comics with issue  15  at which point the series also went from bi monthly to monthly  In Fear  11  Dec  1972   page 11  Gerber created the series  narrative tagline  used in captions   Whatever knows fear burns at the Man Thing s touch   After issue  19  Dec  1973   Man Thing received a solo title  which ran 22 issues  Jan  1974   Oct  1975   Following Morrow  the main series  primary pencillers were  successively  Val Mayerik  Mike Ploog  John Buscema  and Jim Mooney  A sister publication was the larger  quarterly Giant Size Man Thing  1 5  Aug  1974   Aug  1975   which featured 1950s horror fantasy and 1960s science fiction monster reprints as back up stories  with a Howard the Duck feature added in the final two issues  The unintentional double entendre in the sister series  title became a joke among comics readers  12  In the final issue  writer Gerber appeared as a character in the story  claiming he had not been inventing the Man Thing s adventures but simply reporting on them and that he had decided to move on  Gerber continued to write Man Thing guest appearances in other Marvel titles  as well as the serialized  eight page Man Thing feature in the omnibus series Marvel Comics Presents  1 12  Sept  1988   Feb  1989   and a supporting role in The Evolutionary War  coming to the aid of Spider Man  13  Gerber also wrote a graphic novel that Kevin Nowlan spent many years illustrating  but he did not live to see it published  14  A second Man Thing series ran 11 issues  Nov  1979   Jan  1981   Writer Michael Fleisher and penciller Mooney teamed for the first three issues  with the letters page of  3 noting that Fleisher s work had received a great deal of negative criticism and that he had been taken off the book  He was succeeded by  primarily  writer Chris Claremont and illustrators Don Perlin  breakdowns  and Bob Wiacek  finished pencils   Claremont s stories introduced Man Thing and Jennifer Kale to Doctor Strange  whose series he was concurrently writing   after which his material focused on two new supporting characters  John Daltry  Citrusville s new sheriff  and Bobbie Bannister  a formerly wealthy girl who is the only survivor when her parents  yacht is attacked  These characters  stories he resolved by tying them to a resolution for his own War Is Hell series  15  Simon Jowett provided a Man Thing story in Marvel Comics Presents  164 168  Early Oct  Late Nov  1994   The story was set soon after Sallis  transformation  yet depicted Sallis using a standard personal computer with up to date graphics rather than hard copy files  an example of the floating timeline effect  J M  DeMatteis began writing the character in a backup story in Man Thing vol  2   9  March 1981   which opened with a fill in by Dickie McKenzie  DeMatteis would go on to write Man Thing stories in Marvel Team Up  The Defenders  Marvel Fanfare  and the limited series Daydreamers  as well as the eight issue Man Thing vol  3  Dec  1997   July 1998   illustrated by Liam Sharp  The two would re team for the Man Thing feature in the two issue Strange Tales vol  4  Sept  Oct  1998   Four issues were written  but  3 and 4 were never published  Their stories were summarized briefly in Peter Parker  Spider Man Annual  99  also by DeMatteis  with art by Sharp and others  16  17  18  In the 2000s  Man Thing has starred in a handful of stories appearing in one shots and limited series  including Marvel Knights Double Shot  2  July 2002  by Ted McKeever  and Legion of Monsters  Man Thing  1  May 2007  by Charlie Huston and Klaus Janson  In 2008  writer Roberto Aguirre Sacasa retold Man Thing s origin in Dead of Night Featuring Man Thing  1 4  April July 2008   from the Marvel MAX imprint  19  This was followed by an eight page story in Marvel Comics Presents vol  2   12  Oct  2008   by writer Jai Nitz and artist Ben Stenbeck  Man Thing appeared regularly during The Punisher s Franken Castle story arc and became a regular member of Thunderbolts with issue  144   edit  Fictional character biography This article may contain an excessive amount of intricate detail that may only interest a specific audience  Please relocate any relevant information  and remove excessive detail that may be against Wikipedia inclusion policy   November 2008  Dr  Theodore  Ted  Sallis  a native of Omaha  Nebraska  20  is a young biochemist working in the Everglades as part of Dr  Wilma Calvin s Project  Gladiator team  which also consists of Dr  Barbara Morse  her fianc   Dr  Paul Allen  and Jim  A Dr  Wendell is later cited as being on the staff after Dr  Calvin is shot   21  which is attempting to recreate the  Super Soldier Serum  of peak human physicality that had created Captain America  volume  amp  issue needed  During his work  he at one point treated and worked alongside Dr  Curt Connors shortly after he suffered the amputation of his arm  driving his research that would eventually transform him into the Lizard  22  Though warned that the technological terrorist group Advanced Idea Mechanics has been operating in the area  Sallis breaches security by bringing with him his lover  Ellen Brandt  referred to here as  Miss Brandt   but later retconned to be his wife   He destroys his notes to his formula  which he has memorized  Later  at his nearby laboratory  he is ambushed and learns that Brandt has betrayed him  Fleeing with the only sample of his serum  he injects himself with it in hopes of saving himself  However  he crashes his car into the swamp where chemical and  as later explained  magical forces   the result of all realities gone mad  23   instantly transform him into a slow moving plant matter creature with large  solid red eyes  24  and three vines in his facial area  often drawn to imitate the features of an elephant  He finds himself unable to speak  with dim memories  attacking the ambushers and Brandt  burning and scarring part of her face with an acid he now secretes in the presence of violent emotions  The Man Thing then wanders away into the swamp  25  Sallis  mind was apparently extinguished  although on rare occasions he could briefly return to consciousness within his monstrous form  26  and even to his human form  27  Contrary to Sallis  belief  Dr  Calvin had also memorized the formula for the serum  but refused to duplicate it  even on direct orders from Nick Fury  believing that it will only cause further harm  Fury treats her as an elder and respects her decision  much as he dislikes it  28  The magical elements of the metamorphosis are shown when he shuffled between the forms several times early in his life as Man Thing  under the influence of others with arcane powers  29  Before long  the Man Thing first encountered Ka Zar  and agents of A I M  Dr  Allen was revealed to be A I M s mastermind on the mission  he had killed Dr  Wendell and captured the comatose Dr  Calvin  shot in the back by locals who perceived her as a  witch woman  creating monsters upon her recognition that Man Thing is Sallis   aware of her knowledge of the formula  while Morse had only pretended to be in love with him on orders from S H I E L D   which had suspected him  Man Thing breaks into A I M  s base  and immolates a terrified Allen  then  after beckoning his friends to leave  sets the base to self destruct  his friends believing he is committing suicide  30  When next seen  he is catching a baby thrown from a car off a bridge  and knew enough to leave it on the doorstep of the local doctor  Warren B  Thompson  even ringing his doorbell  31  After that  he first encountered the sorceress Jennifer Kale  with whom he briefly shared a psychic link and who knew his true identity  and battled the demon Thog the Nether Spawn  32  who changed him back into Ted Sallis  but would allow him to keep that form only if he killed the Kales  Sallis refused  and was changed by Thog back into the Man Thing  33  Although Thog s dimension was shown to be an illusion  Sallis remembered the experience the next time he regained his human form  while retaining no memories of Man Thing  34  Visitors to the swamp soon discovered it was a place of mystical properties known as the Nexus of All Realities  33  and the Man Thing visited the extra dimensional world of Sandt  and met the benevolent Dakimh the Enchanter  who appeared as an enemy to test his physical and Jennifer s psychological prowess  35  According to the legend of Zhered Na  as told by Joshua Kale  Zhered Na predicted the coming of  a savior men will hate for he will bear the aspect of a monster   Indeed  the powers of Sominus are causing people to become extraordinarily violent throughout the world  After Jennifer  with the aid of Man Thing  rescues the original Tome of Zhered Na  things return to normal  and she loses her psychic link to Man Thing  36  This severance resulted in frequent nightmares in which she and Man Thing battled the Congress of Realities and demons of Sominus  Thog s dimension  37  Developer Franklin Armstrong Schist 38  attempted to build an airport in Citrusville  He was opposed by Black Eagle and a number of young Seminoles living in the area  the rioting attracting Man Thing s attention  39  Man Thing then first encountered Wundarr  later known as the Aquarian   40  and then Howard the Duck  41  At one point Man Thing first encountered the Thing  both were briefly restored to their human forms by a duplicate of the Molecule Man who thought he was the latter s son  42  Later  he first encountered the Foolkiller  43  Man Thing became the Guardian of the Nexus of Realities  and found himself facing demons  ghosts  and time traveling warriors  while continuing to encounter such non supernatural antagonists as rapacious land developers  fascist vigilantes  and common criminals  Regular visitors included Thog the Nether Spawn  Dakimh  Howard the Duck  and several humans  including members of the Cult of Zhered Na 44   led by Jennifer Kale s grandfather  Joshua   45  Dakimh declared that he  Man Thing  Jennifer  Korrek  Warrior Prince of Katharta  and Howard were the chosen five needed to defeat Thog  though the latter fell off a cosmic stepping stone  which Dakimh thought would be fatal  23  Twenty something radio DJ Richard Rory moves to Citrusville  initially after being chased there by the Foolkiller  He and nurse Ruth Hart become involved in defending Man Thing from Schist s attempts to destroy the creature  Rory in particular formed a bond with Man Thing  while Hart left Rory for Hell s Kitchen  New York City  46  In time  reality set in and the energy crisis prevented Schist from completing his airport  The reason for the airport was then revealed  Schist wanted to find the Fountain of Youth  Unfortunately  he learned the hard way that the desired effects of the fountain s water come from bathing in it  not drinking it  and with a newly fragile body  was done in by Man Thing  47  Man Thing and Rory encountered people developing a biosphere and the Cult of Entropy  who revive the Glob  Joe Timms   only for Man Thing to defeat him  48  and a gorgon hillbilly named Maybelle Torke who destroys her husband Zeke s harmless dog  Dawg  while he is trying to protect his master  which got an outraged response in letters pages  49  The two lived through trials of the psychologically disturbed  including a suicidal clown  Darrel Daniel  from Garvey s Carnival  50 Vietnam veterans damaged by mutagenic chemicals  51  and an institutionalized writer named Brian Lazarus in the acclaimed  Song Cry of the Living Dead Man   52  Initially accompanied by Ruth Hart  Ayla Prentiss of Garvey s Carnival accompanied Rory after Hart returned to New York  Soon  Gerber was delving into Ted Sallis  past  In a text story in Monsters Unleashed  8 and  9  it was revealed that Sallis had slept with an underage girl  whose father sought to kill the current occupant of his shack  believing him to be Sallis  In Daredevil  108  Gerber introduced Foggy Nelson s sister Candace  who was being harassed over research she was doing at Empire State University  53  In issue  113  this was revealed to be about the Sallis Papers  research that could have turned the human race into smog breathing monsters and allow industry to proceed unchecked  In Man Thing  15  we are introduced to Sainte Cloud  a young woman who helped Sallis decide to abandon the project  Sometimes this has been erroneously cited as the project that created Man Thing  though it is made clear in the stories that this is an earlier project  Daredevil encountered Man Thing and Richard Rory  and battled Death Stalker over the Sallis Papers  eventually disposing of them in a vat of chemicals  54  Sainte Cloud  who lives in Greenwich Village  relives her experience with Sallis via a hallucinogenic candle that was made by a mysterious candlemaker who had seen Man Thing in New York City  when F A  Schist s widow and daughter brought Man Thing to a theatre in Times Square and displayed him like King Kong  from which he inevitably escaped  55  At one point  an astral pirate ship headed by Captain Fate  ended up in the Nexus  A scientist  Dr  Maura Spinner  was the reincarnation of a pirate queen and both were linked with a satyr named Khordes  In a controversial ending about which Gerber expressed regrets with having written  Spinner stayed with Khordes  56  Dakimh sought his and Jennifer Kale s assistance to help Korrek deal with three villains in Katharta  but the battle is brought to Citrusville  where Man Thing uses street signs as weapons and Dakimh dies of heart failure  Jennifer places the three villains in cocoons and sends them to outer space  Joshua  Jennifer  and Andy Kale bury Dakimh near the swamp  Man Thing accompanied them  possibly only intrigued by their sadness  57  Not long after  Man Thing first encountered Spider Man  and assisted him in battle against the Lizard  58  He would encounter Spider Man numerous times in the future  Spider Man would prove sympathetic to him  but would learn very little about him beyond his current abilities  The final arc of the Gerber series 59  dealt with a hypermasculine laborer named Josefsen forced into retirement at age 65  He went on a rampage as a Mad Viking  killed his grand daughter Astrid s artist boyfriend  as well as the lead guitarist of the rock band Red Feather  and finally  confronted an  Aladdin Sane  type of dystopian rocker named  Star  Spangler  who had taken over Sallis  partially burned shack after the deaths of Sallis  underage flame  her father  and the writer he mistook for Sallis  As the Viking  Josefsen allied himself with Olivia Selby  who led a book burning riot at Citrusville High School  leading to the slaughter of several teachers  Man Thing s involvement led to him being dumped in the local sewage treatment plant  which only increased his ability to leave the swamp  while Richard Rory got fired by the local radio station for speaking out against the book burning on the air  Rory attempted to leave for Atlanta  and Man Thing and Carol Selby  Olivia s daughter  demanded to go with him  In Atlanta  Man Thing wanders away from the hotel where they are staying the night and encounters a satanic sect about to sacrifice a child and rescues him  60  The group then meets Robert Nicolle  a man with neither feeling nor physical sensation  who appeared as the costumed criminal the Scavenger  and whose sister  Dani Nicolle  had her sensations on overload and must project them into objects called Nightmare Boxes  61  The Nightmare Boxes are to build a pyramid for the benefit of Thog  but the use of a Nightmare Box containing both Man Thing and Steve Gerber  working at the behest of Dakimh s spirit  as the top of the pyramid defeats Thog and saves the world  Gerber tells the final issue in first person  recapping the entire series and saying that he has to stop writing the series because it has become too personal  since he does not want to have to save the world again  62  Gerber s involvement is foreshadowed when he twice encounters Richard Rory  who believes he has had a brush with destiny  63  Man Thing later first encountered Jude the Entropic Man  who had been the Entropist Yagzan before he was killed by the Glob   64  Man Thing then first encountered the supernatural villain D Spayre and was assisted by Spider Man  D Spayre causes him to feel fear and partially self immolate for the first time  65  Man Thing also encountered Doctor Strange  and aided Strange against Baron Mordo  66  A scientist  Dr  Oheimer  attempted to restore Ted Sallis  mind  now scattered about in ganglia throughout Man Thing s body  but was slain by government agents  67  A love triangle then took Man Thing to the Himalayas  68  Chris Claremont  the writer by this point  introduced himself as a character in the final issue of Volume 2  as Steve Gerber had in the finale of Volume 1  Additionally  Claremont temporarily became the Man Thing after being stabbed to death with Captain Fate s sword by possessed Sheriff John Daltry  His and other characters  deaths were later resolved with the intervention of the War is Hell series lead  John Kowalski  now an aspect of Marvel Comics  manifestation of Death  69  Man Thing later appeared briefly alongside the superhero Cyclops  aiding him in a battle against D Spayre  70  Man Thing became embroiled in Project  Glamor  71  a U S  government conspiracy involving Ted Sallis   super soldier  serum related to the Iran Contra Scandal  Numerous soldiers are being transformed into monsters in attempts to recreate the serum  while the executives financing the scheme are forced to testify before Congress  72  Later  the extra dimensional Quagmire came into this reality through the Man Thing s body  It appeared like a pregnancy  with Jennifer Kale and Quasar serving as midwives for the delivery of an adult criminal  73  Later  Jennifer and Quasar have to reassemble their friend s body when it is blasted apart by a war amongst the Nexus guardians of each reality  Quasar ends the war with the Star Brand that he obtained to escape from the New Universe  when he returned  he arrived in Man Thing s swamp and kissed him on the forehead   74  After Onslaught  Man Thing was somehow summoned to the biosphere at Charles Xavier s Massachusetts Academy  where he helped Franklin Richards  Leech  Artie Maddicks  Tana Nile  and Howard the Duck escape from a rampaging Black Tom Cassidy  75  Apparently  he helped the group escape from a dark swordsman through various dimensions  and during this time  gained the ability to talk  though he did not speak much like Ted Sallis of old  76  He expressed that he had no idea how he was doing this  and in fact  he was not  Everything they were seeing  including a world based on Dr  Seuss and a version of Duckworld in which Howard is seen as a hero and celebrity  as well as Man Thing s speaking  are all products of Franklin s mutant mental abilities  When Franklin is willing to accept that even the dark swordsman  a figure representing the apparent death of his family  was his own creation  the group is returned to Man Thing s swamp  77  Man Thing becomes Franklin s self appointed protector  but when Franklin loses the pocket universe he carries to an alligator  his fear draws Man Thing to turn on him  Although Franklin is able to destroy the alligator  with much sadness  in order to retrieve it  before Man Thing can touch him  this close call presents him as a superfluous threat to Franklin in the perception of a Celestial  This Celestial causes Man Thing to feel fear  self immolate  and collapse into the swamp  78  This was not the end of Man Thing  He somehow merged with a Norn Stone Bearer named Carl Shuffler  a postal worker in New York City  He initially manifested himself non physically and with extremely high power  causing all those in Shuffler s very presence to burn at the slightest knowing of fear  with no contact  Eventually developing into a hybrid of Shuffler and Man Thing s features  they are separated by Spider Man  who gets a dose of the enormous empathic power of Man Thing and learns that the latter s body  now sloughed off by a surviving Shuffler  is being reformulated in the Everglades  79  The immense psychic energy created by Man Thing s return draws his wife  Ellen Brandt Sallis  to return to the Citrusville area  She is still half scarred from the Man Thing s touch  The existence of the scars contradicts the story in Monsters Unleashed  5 in which her second husband  Leonard  a plastic surgeon  fixes her  Recognizing him as her husband  she tries to save Man Thing from a hail of bullets  Doctor Strange saves them both  Man Thing is also set upon an enormous mission the Nexus of All Realities has shattered due to the return of the non mutant heroes lost in Franklin s pocket universe after conquering Onslaught  and he must reassemble the pieces  and Ellen is to be his guide  though she knows not how  80  A being calling himself Mr  Termineus is interested in both of them  as well as a little boy named Job Burke  who is actually the Sallis  son  who had been put up for adoption  He presents them with a singing staff that apparently has much power  including the ability to lead and transport them to the pieces  and sometimes it is able to sing through Man Thing  temporarily turning him white when it does so  81  The first piece of the Nexus found is trapped within the mind of Eric Simon Payne  also known as Devil Slayer   who is now in a mental institution in Charles  Massachusetts where Ellen had once been a patient  82  The next was in Howard the Duck  who had been kidnapped by the Cult of Entropy  who wanted to help along the multi world destruction  83  The third was held by Cleito  wife of Poseidon  and Namor intervened  as her tomb was sacred to all Atlanteans and he would not allow its desecration  A sea deity called Evenor transforms Man Thing back into Ted Sallis  and takes him  Ellen  whom he has turned into an undine  and Namor back to ancient Atlantis  where a living Cleito gives up the piece willingly  84  The fourth went into outer space and began turning a dead world into a live one  K Ad mon  an entity that had taken possession of Man Thing through the staff  spoke in a brutal and hypermasculine  in Ellen s words  fashion and fought the Silver Surfer in order to reclaim the fragment  85  Soon after  the Burkes learned of the existence of Mr  Termineus and the identity of Job s biological parents  The story breaks off when Payne and Sorrow  another of the asylum inmates  both made mystics in issue  5  intervene in his gambit  86  The story continued in issues 3 and 4  but they were never published  Summaries based on DeMatteis  unillustrated scripts appear on the K Ad mon and Ellen Brandt pages on Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe  provided to the site by the author  16  17  When Man Thing next appears  in Peter Parker  Spider Man Annual  99  his body  now white  is now fully the vessel of K Ad mon  while Ted and Ellen saved the multiverse by merging fully with the Nexus  This was possible because Ted Sallis was  of the lineage   The couple is both fully merged and fully individual  and Ted has to leave Ellen in charge of the Nexus over the course of the story  A footnote refers us to the  as yet unpublished  stories in Strange Tales 3  amp  4  K Ad mon is described as being the first soul on the planet  The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe goes so far as to say  based on communications with DeMatteis  that this is Adam  who had previously appeared as the entity Spyros  whom Daimon Hellstrom encountered during Gerber s Marvel Spotlight run  17  87  In this issue  K Ad mon departs from Man Thing s body  and Ted must repossess it  sending Spider Man through multiple realities to rescue Ellen  drained to a thread  Spider Man is shocked that Man Thing could be married  can sing  and wonders when he got bleached  but he complies  In spite of the weakness of Ellen  Man Thing speaks  not sings  with the voices of Ted and Ellen of how he foiled a plot that K Ad mon had been forced to allow  because the two of them are  only human   When we next see Man Thing in Hulk  4  he still has his long  shamanistic  hair   but he is once again green and silent  In Hulk  6  this Man Thing is said to have a dim memory of the K Ad mon experience  but in Hulk  7  the story s villain  Owen Candler  is revealed to be a plant monster who only thinks it is Owen Candler  just like Swamp Thing  All of his vegetable matter  people  and animals  including Betty Ross Banner and this Man Thing  collapse into nonexistence after he is burned to death by Man Thing  who still has this ability in spite of apparently not being the real thing  At any rate  he is back to is old form when he discovers a mystical disturbance affecting Danielle Moonstar and Arcadia Deville  reuniting him with Jennifer Kale  who had been teaching t ai chi to members of X Force  88  There  he imparts knowledge to Moonstar by empathic means via touching her forehead  This allows Moonstar to fire a mystic arrow at the right location in the Citadel generated by the Deville of an alternate reality  89  Some time later  an unnamed mad scientist captured Man Thing and injected him with distillations of various emotions to see his visceral reactions  but once Man Thing oozed out of his bonds  the scientist felt fear and was destroyed  90  Later  Man Thing and other beings  such as Vermin  Nightmare  Carrion  and Gator Grant become possessed and attack Kurt Wagner  Nightcrawler  at the Florida carnival where he was once imprisoned  all bent on obtaining the Soulsword  91  Nightcrawler initially believes this to be the work of the demon The Hive  or perhaps Belasco  but The Hive possessed only Wagner s ex boss  Jardine  and briefly  Wolverine  as well as his brother years before   92  Eventually  Mephisto reveals himself as the one who was in control of Man Thing and the others  Dr  Hank McCoy  the Beast  tells Wagner that the burns he received from Man Thing were not severe enough to leave a scar  93  Some time later  he is captured by the DeFlyte family  the wealthiest in Citrusville  who feast on his body each day  to the point that only his head and shoulders remain  The DeFlytess hire a new gardener named Esperanza  who is appalled by what she sees  and places two flowers from the swamp on the tray  the DeFlytes collapsed in sleep around the dinner table  This is enough for Man Thing to regenerate fully and destroy his captors  all of whom end up with their intestines spilled  94  During the Civil War storyline  two S H I E L D  agents are sent to the Everglades to register the Man Thing with the Superhuman Registration Act  As the Man Thing is mentally unfit to sign documents  this is actually a cover for a corrupt S H I E L D  boss to take out one disreputable member and put another one in his place while he retires on stolen gold  The attempt to destroy Man Thing fails  95  A young member of the undead surfaces in the swamp to which Man Thing s arm can be quickly seen  terminating the zombie before it resurfaces  He is next seen walking away in the distance  96  It is later indicated that he will be part of the Midnight Sons team to track down renegade Marvel Zombies who have been able to transport themselves to different coordinates  97  Later  after a disastrous attempt by Michael Morbius to eradicate the zombie threat  Dormammu  Lord of the Dark Dimension  tempts Jennifer Kale with dark powers  but she refuses  summoning Man Thing by breaking a glass orb containing mud from the Florida swamps  Man Thing swings at the astral projection of Dormamu  his fist passing through it harmlessly  Shortly after  Jennifer introduces Man Thing to the other members of the Midnight Sons  Michael Morbius  The Living Vampire   Daimon Hellstrom  Son of Satan   and Jacob  Jack  Russell  Werewolf by Night    Morbius   cure  for the zombie virus caused the virus to become airborne  no longer needing a host body to infect others  The result was a cloud that  according to Jennifer     is so bloated with blood and gore  it s discharging the viscera   in the form of infected rain   which is sucking any life it comes in contact with back up into itself   like some grotesque parody of the water cycle   Man Thing chases the head of an alternate reality Deadpool  carried by an alternate reality Simon  Cadaver  Garth  into the infected rain where he can draw strength from the earth to heal himself  providing resistance to the life draining rain  The rain kills the superhumans Ogre  Razor Wire  and Lightning Fist  members of Roxxon Blackridges security force   and assembles their bodies into an amalgam zombie  It appears that Zombie Deadpool has some control over this new zombie  and with it  stabs Man Thing through the chest with a street lamp  lifting him off the ground  Without the earth to replenish him  Man Thing is exposed to the rain  dissolving his body and killing him  98  However  Man Thing quickly grows back and helps the Midnight Sons by burning the amalgam zombie that was attacking them  99  In the Dark Avengers series during the Dark Reign storyline  Man Thing is torn apart by the titular team and captured  100  Later Man Thing is seen protecting Moloids who are collecting and spiriting away the Punisher s body parts after he is dismembered and decapitated by Daken on the orders of Norman Osborn  101  He and Morbius  the Living Vampire were able to revive Punisher as a Frankenstein like monster called FrankenCastle  102  After a fight with Samurai like monster hunters from the Hunter of Monster Special Forces  Man Thing manages to get FrankenCastle to join his Legion of Monsters  103  Man Thing also appeared in an issue of Deadpool  Merc with a Mouth  6  where he encounters the head of the zombie Deadpool once again  and still holds a grudge against him for attempting to kill him  Man Thing even attempts to kill the agents of A I M and the standard timeline Deadpool to simply get to the head  However  the entire group quickly escapes  due to the Man Thing s slow speed  Although when Deadpool and the head of Zombie Deadpool are captured by agents of HYDRA while fleeing  Man Thing puts aside his possible hatred for the head and assists Deadpool  104  During the Heroic Age storyline  Steve Rogers in his new identity of Captain Steve Rogers has brought Man Thing in to serve as the transportation for the Thunderbolts team overseen by Luke Cage in order to atone for some of the deaths it has caused  Hank Pym warns Luke Cage not to let it sense his fear or his corrosive chemicals that secretes will damage his unbreakable skin  Luke Cage then asks Man Thing if they can cooperate  holding out his arm  Man Thing grasps it with his own  Since Cage feels no pain  it is apparent that Man Thing agrees  105  During the Fear Itself storyline  Man Thing is driven on a rampage  sent into the fray by Satana  106  due to the fear and chaos he senses on the part of the citizenry causing Frankenstein s Monster  Howard the Duck  Nighthawk  and She Hulk to become the Fearsome Four in order to stop Man Thing  107  When he returns to the Thunderbolts  simply appearing next to them by magic  he

removed   October 2008  Man Thing is a former scientist who was transformed into a creature composed of vegetable matter through the synergistic interaction of mystical energy and chemical mutagens  Though the creature now lacks a normal human intellect and has shed any desire to communicate with human society  it nevertheless often becomes an accidental hero as it stumbles upon various crime and horror scenarios  In the pages of the Thunderbolts  Dr  Henry Pym has expressed the view that the Man Thing is sentient  though difficult to communicate with  110  For example  he once rescued an infant and left the child with a doctor  which would require an understanding of the function of a doctor and the ability to navigate to a specific address   111  He is shown to understand concepts such as how to ring a doorbell  31  how to put an arm in a sling  112  and even how to flip an auto destruct switch  30  The change in Man Thing s intellect can partly be explained by fact that its brain  sensory organs  and central nervous system are now organized in a completely different fashion than a human  for instance  Man Thing s auditory receptors are in his forehead  40  Regardless of what level of humanity the creature still possesses  it can discern when a person s motivations are evil  which causes it pain and motivates it to lash out  113  The Man Thing possesses a variety of superhuman powers  described below  that are derived from the interaction of the scientific formula created by Ted Sallis and the mystical energies of the Nexus of Realities  It is able to sense human emotions  and is enraged by fear and automatically secretes a strong chemical corrosive  anyone feeling fear and clutched by the Man Thing is prone to be burned  either chemically or mystically   hence the series  tag line   Whatever knows fear burns at the touch of the Man Thing   Though fear is understandably most people s response to the creature  both for his monstrous appearance and the physical danger of his touch  typically only villains end up meeting an immolating death at its hands  Many survive being burned  notably Ellen Brandt  114 Kurt  Nightcrawler  Wagner  115  whom he does not even scar  93  and Mongu  whose hand he permanently attaches to his axe  116  either due to intervention or dissipation  Unusual psychic and mystical forces react in what passes as the  brain  cells located throughout his body  These unique forces render the Man Thing extremely sensitive to emotions  Emotions that are mild and generally considered positive arouse curiosity and the Man Thing will sometimes observe from a distance  However  emotions that are often viewed as negative  such as violent emotions  rage  anger  hatred  and fear  cause the Man Thing great discomfort and might provoke him to attack  Once provoked into violent actions  his body secretes highly concentrated sulfuric acid that can burn human beings to ashes within a matter of seconds  Even individuals that have high levels of superhuman durability have proven unable to withstand this potent acid  While the Man Thing is devoid of violent emotions  his body produces a type of foamy  soapy mucus that neutralizes the acid  Although Man Thing s superhuman strength varies considerably in his comic book appearances  it has been established that the creature possesses physical strength beyond the limitations of any human athlete  Initially  the Man Thing is only slightly stronger than Captain America  volume  amp  issue needed  but in later appearances  the Man Thing possesses sufficient superhuman strength to stand toe to toe with much stronger villains  volume  amp  issue needed  He is able to lift a 2 000 pound automobile when sufficiently moved to do so  23  The Man Thing s body is practically invulnerable to harm  Because his body is not entirely solid  but composed of the muck and vegetative matter of the swamp  fists  bullets  knives  energy blasts  etc  will either pass entirely through him or will harmlessly be lodged within his body  Even if a vast portion of the Man Thing s body were to be ripped away or incinerated  he would be able to reorganize himself by drawing the necessary material from the surrounding vegetation  Devil Slayer once sliced him nearly in half  117  and he has survived being incinerated by a Celestial  118  although his healing from the latter has been the longest and most complex in his lifetime  119  Due to the construction of his body  the Man Thing is able to ooze his body through openings or around barriers that would seem too small for him to pass though  The smaller the opening  the longer it will take for him to reorganize his mass upon reaching the other side  This ability  120  can be defeated mystically  116  The Man Thing was once dependent upon the swamp he inhabits for his continued survival  his body would slowly weaken and eventually lapse into dormancy if not returned to the swamp or would be greatly damaged if exposed to clean water  His exposure to the Citrusville waste treatment plant 121  greatly enhanced his ability to leave the swamp  as he became a self contained ecosystem  feeding off his own waste products  122  He generally leaves the swamp of his own accord only if he senses a mystical disturbance  Man Thing has also demonstrated himself susceptible to possession by other entities  123  Although the Man Thing lacks a normal human intellect  in its life as Ted Sallis  it possessed a Ph D  in biochemistry  volume  amp  issue needed  Sallis is legally dead  but his identity is known to numerous living people  including Wilma Calvin  Ellen Brandt  Stephen Strange  Owen Reece  Ben Grimm  Thog  and Jennifer Kale  and anyone they may have told  His identity as Man Thing could not be considered secret  but his existence is generally believed to be a hoax  and an obscure one at that  95  119 In universe  knowledge of his existence is rarely tied to the experiments of Sallis  as are speculations as to any human identity he may have had  Despite having appeared in Citrusville many times  many there still believe him to be a rumor  124   edit  Comic book spin offs Dr  Barbara Morse was introduced in the second Man Thing story by Len Wein Neal Adams  although because of publication delays  she was introduced in Astonishing Tales  6  with the Wein Adams story presented as flashback  Morse became the costumed hero Mockingbird in Marvel Team Up  95 and went on to become a prominent member of Avengers West Coast  eventually sacrificing her life to save her husband  Clint  Hawkeye  Barton  from Mephisto  125  Until recently  her spirit fought alongside Daimon Hellstrom to eliminate demons from his Hell  126  however  she has appeared alive during the Secret Invasion crossover  volume  amp  issue needed  At the end of Secret Invasion  Mockingbird was revealed to be alive and had been one of the early captures of the Skrulls  volume  amp  issue needed  Morse has joined the New Avengers and has had adventures alongside Hawkeye  volume  amp  issue needed  Jennifer Kale debuted in Fear  11  which was the first story Steve Gerber wrote for Marvel after his initial tryout  She went on to appear in two team books  The Legion of Night  created and written by Gerber and partially composed of several other Gerber created supporting cast members such as Martin Gold and Dr  Katherine Reynolds  and Bronwyn Carlton and Bryan Walsh s Witches in which she teamed with Satana and Topaz under the tutelage of Doctor Strange  Gerber introduced Howard the Duck in a Man Thing story in Adventure into Fear  19  Howard  who was displaced from a planet of anthropomorphics in another dimension via the swamp s Nexus of All Realities  later acquired his own series  which was written by Gerber for the first 27 issues  The Foolkiller  a vigilante who used a ray gun to disintegrate not only criminals but anyone he considered foolish  was introduced in issue  3 of this series  bent on slaying disc jockey Richard Rory  introduced in the previous issue  When Rory served time for trumped up kidnapping charges  he accidentally created another Foolkiller when he revealed too much detail about the previous incarnation and the whereabouts of his gear  This Foolkiller became an occasional villain in other Marvel comics  Both Rory and this second Foolkiller  along with nurse Ruth Hart  who appeared in Man Thing   2 7  were supporting characters in Gerber s Omega the Unknown  while David Anthony Kraft made Rory a potential love interest for She Hulk  A third version of the character  who was in internet communication with the second  starred in Gerber s 1990 Foolkiller miniseries  A second series by Greg Hurwitz  featuring a fourth Foolkiller  appeared in 2008   edit  Other versions  edit  The Adventures of the X Men In The Adventures of the X Men  which is set in the world of the X Men animated series  Earth 921031   Storm and

energy out of the Nexus of All Realities  D Spayre  working for the Dweller in Darkness  is burned by Man Thing when he fears failure  After their defeat of D Spayre  Jean makes a psychic link with Man Thing  which she had done earlier to learn his origin  and is imparted information that she believes is the most important thing in the world  Jean is forced to become the Phoenix once more  using the information obtained from Man Thing  destroys the M Kraan Crystal  and in doing so  ends the universe  However  one survivor is sent into the universe to come  Galactus  thereby implying that the animation continuity takes place eons before the mainstream Marvel continuity  127   edit  Mutant X The Mutant X comic book series depicts a Marvel Universe in which characters  counterparts are vastly different  In the Mutant X Annual  99  1999   Doctor Strange  the sorcerer supreme of Earth  reveals himself to be the Man Thing  He returns in Mutant X Annual  01  2001  and Mutant X  32  June 2001    edit  Earth 691 Amazing Adventures volume 2  38 tells the story of what happened when Killraven stumbled across the Miami Museum of Cultural Development and became caught up in the projected dreams of an astronaut from the  Mars launch in 1999   During the hallucination  Killraven encountered distorted versions of numerous Marvel characters  Rather ambiguously  the awakened astronaut later described the figures as  all the heroes from my youth  but he also often referred to them as  myths   The only Marvel character that is definitely  real  in the projected nightmare is the Man Thing who appears as part of an actual memory of an encounter that the astronaut had with the creature in the Florida Everglades   edit  Marvel Super Hero Squad Man Thing appears in issue  10 of
