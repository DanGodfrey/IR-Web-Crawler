Elections in the United States From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search For a complete list of elections  see List of elections in the United States  An 1846 painting showing a polling judge administering an oath to a voter The United States has a federal government  with elected officials at the federal  national   state and local levels  On a national level  the head of state  the President  is elected indirectly by the people  through an Electoral College  In modern times  the electors virtually always vote with the popular vote of their state  All members of the federal legislature  the Congress  are directly elected  There are many elected offices at the state level  each state having at least an elective governor and legislature  There are also elected offices at the local level  in counties and cities  It is estimated that across the whole country  over one million offices are filled in every electoral cycle  Both federal and state laws regulate elections  The United States Constitution defines  to a basic extent  how federal elections are held  in Article One and Article Two and various amendments  State law regulates most aspects of electoral law  including primaries  the eligibility of voters  beyond the basic constitutional definition   the running of each state s electoral college  and the running of state and local elections  The financing of elections has always been controversial  because private sources of finance make up substantial amounts of campaign contributions  especially in federal elections  Voluntary public funding for candidates willing to accept spending limits was introduced in 1974 for presidential primaries and elections  The Federal Elections Commission  created in 1975 by an amendment to the Federal Election Campaign Act has the responsibility to disclose campaign finance information  to enforce the provisions of the law such as the limits and prohibitions on contributions  and to oversee the public funding of U S  presidential elections  The federal government has also been involved in attempts to increase voter turnout  by measures such as the National Voter Registration Act of 1993

External links  edit  Voting  edit  Method The method of voting is first past the post where the highest polling candidate is elected  In the case of the Presidential electoral college the  edit  Eligibility The eligibility of an individual for voting is set out in the constitution and also regulated at state level  The constitution states that suffrage cannot be denied on grounds of race or color  sex or age for citizens eighteen years or older  Beyond these basic qualifications  it is the responsibility of state legislatures to regulate voter eligibility  Some states bar convicted criminals  especially felons  from voting for a fixed period of time or indefinitely  The number of American adults who are currently or permanently ineligible to vote due to felony convictions is estimated to be 5 3 million  1  Some states also have legacy constitutional statements barring the  insane  or  idiots  from voting  such references are generally considered obsolete and are being considered for review or removal where they appear  2   edit  Voter registration Every state except North Dakota requires that citizens who wish to vote be registered  Some states allow citizens to register to vote on the same day of the election  see below  Traditionally  voters had to register at state offices to vote  but in the mid 1990s efforts were made by the federal government to make registering easier  in an attempt to increase turnout  The National Voter Registration Act of 1993  the  Motor Voter  law  required state governments that receive certain types of federal funding to make the voter registration process easier by providing uniform registration services through drivers  license registration centers  disability centers  schools  libraries  and mail in registration  States with same day registration are exempt from Motor Voter  namely  Idaho  Minnesota  New Hampshire  North Dakota  Wisconsin  and Wyoming   edit  Absentee voting An absentee ballot paper for Milton  New Hampshire  This ballot paper gives the voter the option to write in a candidate and use straight ticket voting  This ballot also contains a referendum placed on the ballot by the state legislature  Voters unable or unwilling to vote at polling stations on Election Day can vote via absentee ballots  Absentee ballots are most commonly sent and received via the United States Postal Service  Despite their name  absentee ballots are often requested and submitted in person  About half of all states and U S  territories allow  no excuse absentee   where no reason is required to request an absentee ballot  Others require a valid reason  such as infirmity or travel  be given before a voter can participate using an absentee ballot  Some states  including California  3  and Washington 4  5  allow citizens to apply for permanent absentee voter status  which will automatically receive an absentee ballot for each election  Typically a voter must request an absentee ballot before the election occurs  A significant source of absentee ballots is the population of Americans living outside the United States  In 1986 Congress enacted the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act  UOCAVA   UOCAVA requires that the states and territories allow members of the United States Uniformed Services and merchant marine  their family members  and United States citizens residing outside the United States to register and vote absentee in elections for Federal offices  Though many states had pre existing statutes in place UOCAVA made it mandatory and nationally uniform   Generally  all U S  citizens 18 years or older who are or will be residing outside the United States during an election period are eligible to vote absentee in any election for Federal office  In addition  all members of the Uniformed Services  their family members and members of the Merchant Marine and their family members  who are U S  citizens  may vote absentee in Federal  state and local elections   6  Absentee ballots from these voters can often be transmitted private delivery services  fax  or email  7   edit  Mail ballots Mail ballots are similar in many respects to an absentee ballot  However they are used for Mailing Precincts where on election day no polling place is opened for a specific precinct  8  In Oregon  all ballots are delivered through the mail   edit  Early voting Main article  Early voting United States Early voting is a formal process where voters can cast their ballots prior to the official election day   edit  Voting equipment Further information  Voting machine Voters casting their ballots in polling places record their votes most commonly with optical scan voting machines or DRE voting machines  Voting machine selection is typically done through a state s local election jurisdiction including counties  cities  and townships  Many of these local jurisdictions have changed their voting equipment since 2000 due to the passage of the Help America Vote Act  HAVA   which allocated funds for the replacement of lever machine and punch card voting equipment   edit  Levels of election The United States has perhaps the most complicated electoral system in the world  Voters are asked to make more decisions and asked to do so more frequently than citizens of other democracies  This Byzantine electoral structure in the US does provide the greatest opportunity for input  but at a cost by demanding so much of the public it means that many are overwhelmed by the complexity of the system and ultimately fail to vote  9   edit  Federal elections See also  Election Day  United States  The United States has a presidential system of government  which means that the executive and legislature are elected separately  Article One of the United States Constitution requires that any election for the U S  President must occur on a single day throughout the country  elections for Congressional offices  however  can be held at different times  Congressional and presidential elections take place simultaneously every four years  and the intervening Congressional elections  which take place every two years  are called Midterm elections  The constitution states that members of the United States House of Representatives must be at least 25 years old  a citizen of the United States for at least seven years  and be a  legal  inhabitant of the state they represent  Senators must be at least 30 years old  a citizen of the United States for at least nine years  and be a  legal  inhabitant of the state they represent  The President must be at least 35 years old  a natural born citizen of the United States and a resident in the United States for at least fourteen years  It is the responsibility of state legislatures to regulate the qualifications for a candidate appearing on a ballot paper  although in order to get onto the ballot  a candidate must often collect a legally defined number of signatures   edit  Presidential elections Main articles  United States presidential election and Electoral College  United States  The President and the Vice President are elected together in a Presidential election  The election is indirect  the winner being determined by votes cast by electors of the Electoral College  In modern times  voters in each state select a slate of electors from a list of several slates designated by different parties or candidates  and the electors typically promise in advance to vote for the candidates of their party  whose names usually appear on the ballot rather than those of the individual electors   The winner of the election is the candidate with at least 270 Electoral College votes  It is possible for a candidate to win the electoral vote  and lose the  nationwide  popular vote  receive fewer votes nationwide than the second ranked candidate   Until the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution of 1804  the runner up in a Presidential election became the Vice President  Electoral College votes are cast by individual states by a group of electors  each elector casts one electoral college vote  Until the Twenty third Amendment to the United States Constitution of 1961 the District of Columbia citizens did not have representation and or electors in the electoral college  In modern times  with electors usually committed to vote for a party candidate in advance  electors that vote against the popular vote in their state are called faithless electors  and occurrences are rare  State law regulates how states cast their electoral college votes  In all states except Maine and Nebraska  the candidate that wins the most votes in the state receives all its electoral college votes  a  winner takes all  system   From 1969 in Maine  and from 1991 in Nebraska  two electoral votes are awarded based on the winner of the statewide election  and the rest  two in Maine  three in Nebraska  go to the highest vote winner in each of the state s congressional districts  Incumbent Presidents and challengers usually seek to have a  balanced ticket   so that the Presidential candidate and the Vice Presidential candidates have complementary political support and political roles  allowing them to do well among different constituencies  Usually  there is some kind of balance  for example geographical  ideological  or in terms of  especially federal  government experience  The nominated Vice Presidential candidate is called the  running mate   Although incumbent Presidents can be challenged in the primaries  none have lost their party s nomination in recent times  although Gerald Ford in 1976 came close   The last incumbent President to not seek a second term was Lyndon B  Johnson  who stepped down after serving the remainder of John F  Kennedy s term and another full term  he was eligible for another term   The electoral college has long been criticized  for several reasons  It has been criticized for being undemocratic compared to a direct system of election  Another criticism is that it creates inequality between voters in different states during the presidential election  Usually  only voters in swing states determine the outcome of the election and as a result  it is claimed that the vast majority of Americans  who live in non competitive states  are largely ignored by political campaigns  If the electoral college were abolished and if the whole country were treated as one district for Presidential elections  then the result would not depend on crucial swing states  It also creates inequality in that the populations of very small states  which have a minimum of 3 Electoral college votes  are overrepresented compared with voters from larger states  For example  Wyoming has a population of 493 782 and 3 EC votes  164 594 people per EC vote  California has a population of 33 871 648 and 55 EC votes  615 848 people per EC vote  Abolishing the college and replacing it with a national direct system would also prevent a candidate from receiving fewer votes nationwide than their opponent  but still winning more electoral votes  which last occurred in the 2000 Presidential election  Also  the electoral college discriminates against candidates who do not have support concentrated in several states  In 1992  Ross Perot won 18 9  of the national vote  but received no electoral college votes  The electoral college would require a constitutional amendment to be abolished  and since three quarters of state legislatures would be required to ratify an amendment that would effectively redistribute voting power from many small states to numerically fewer large states  it is thought that an amendment would fail  v t e United States presidential elections 1788 1792 1796

of the three groups is renewed every two years  Until the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1913  Senators were elected by state legislatures  not the electorate of states  v

edit  House of Representatives elections A chart of party balance in the House The House of Representatives has 435 members  elected for a two year term in single seat constituencies  House of Representatives elections are held every two years on the first Tuesday after November 1 in even years  House elections are first past the post elections that elect a Representative from each of 435 House districts which cover the United States  Special House elections can occur between if a member dies or resigns during a term  The delegates of the territories of American Samoa  District of Columbia  Guam  the Northern Mariana Islands  Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands are also elected  House elections occur every two years  correlated with presidential elections or halfway through a President s term  Typically  when a House election occurs in the same year as a presidential election  the party of the presidential winner will gain seats  On the other hand  there is a historical pattern that the incumbent president s party loses seats in elections that are held in the middle of a presidential term  This may be because the President s popularity has slipped since election  or because the President s popularity encouraged supporters to come out to vote for him in the presidential election  but these supporters are less likely to vote when the President is not up for election  As the redistricting commissions of states are often partisan  districts are often drawn which benefit incumbents  An increasing trend has been for incumbents to have an overwhelming advantage in House elections  and since the 1994 election  an unusually low number of seats has changed hands in each election citation needed   Due to gerrymandering  fewer than 10  of all House seats are contested in each election cycle  Over 90  of House members are reelected every two years  due to lack of electoral competition  Gerrymandering of the House  combined with the divisions inherent in the design of the Senate and of the Electoral College  result in a discrepancy between the percentage of popular support for various political parties and the actual level of the parties  representation  v t e United States House of Representatives elections 1789 1790 1792 1794 1796 1798 1800 1802 1804 1806 1808 1810 1812 1814 1816 1818 1820 1822 1824 1826 1828 1830 1832 1834

some states on a joint ticket and in some states separately  some separately in different electoral cycles  The governors of the territories of American Samoa  Guam  the Northern Mariana Islands  Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands are also elected  In some states  executive positions such as Attorney General and Secretary of State are also elected offices  All members of state legislatures and territorial jurisdiction legislatures are elected  state senators and state representatives assembly members  Nebraska s legislature is unicameral  so only senators are elected  In some states  members of the state supreme court and other members of the state judiciary are elected  Proposals to amend the state constitution are also placed on the ballot in some states  As a matter of convenience and cost saving  elections for many of these state and local offices are held at the same time as either the federal presidential or midterm elections  There are a handful of

Politics of the United States Americans vote for a specific candidate instead of directly selecting a particular political party  The United States Constitution has never formally addressed the issue of political parties  The Founding Fathers such as Alexander Hamilton and James Madison did not support domestic political factions at the time the Constitution was written  10  In addition  the first President of the United States  George Washington  was not a member of any political party at the time of his election or throughout his tenure as president  Furthermore  he hoped that political parties would not be formed  fearing conflict and stagnation  11  Nevertheless  the beginnings of the American two party system emerged from his immediate circle of advisers  Thus  it is up to the candidate to decides under what party he she should run  registers to run  pays the fees  etc  In the primary elections  the party organization stays neutral until one candidate has been elected  The platform of the party is written by the winning candidate  in presidential elections  in other elections no platform is involved   Each candidate has his or her own campaign  fund raising organisation  etc  The primary elections in the main parties is organized by the states  who also register the party affiliation of the voters  this also makes it easier to gerrymander the congressional districts   The party is thus little more than a campaign organization for the main elections  However  elections in the United States often do become de facto national races between the political parties  In what is known as  presidential coattails   candidates in presidential elections usually bring out supporters who then vote for his party s candidates for other offices  On the other hand  midterm elections are sometimes regarded as a referendum on the sitting president s and or incumbent party s performance  12  13   edit  Ballot access Main article  Ballot access in the United States of America Ballot access refers to the laws which regulate under what conditions access is granted for a candidate or political party to appear on voters  ballots  Each State has its own ballot access laws to determine who may appear on ballots and who may not  According to Article I  Section 4  of the United States Constitution  the authority to regulate the time  place  and manner of federal elections is up to each State  unless Congress legislates otherwise  Depending on the office and the state  it may be possible for a voter to cast a write in vote for a candidate whose name does not appear on the ballot  but it is extremely rare for such a candidate to win office   edit  Campaign finance Main article  Campaign finance in the United States The funding of electoral campaigns has always been a controversial issue in American politics  Infringement of free speech  First Amendment  is an argument against restrictions on campaign contributions  while allegations of corruption arising from unlimited contributions and the need for political equality are arguments for the other side  14  Private funds are a major source of finance  from individuals and organizations  The first attempt to regulate campaign finance by legislation was in 1867  but major legislation  with the intention to widely enforce  on campaign finance was not introduced until the 1970s  Money contributed to campaigns can be classified into  hard money  and  soft money   Hard money is money contributed directly to a campaign  by an individual or organization  Soft money is money from an individual or organization not contributed to a campaign  but spent in candidate specific advertising or other efforts that benefits that candidate by groups supporting the candidate  but legally not coordinated by the official campaign  The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 required candidates to disclose sources of campaign contributions and campaign expenditure  It was amended in 1974 to legally limit campaign contributions  It banned direct contributing to campaigns by corporations and trade unions and limited individual donations to  1 000 per campaign  It introduced public funding for Presidential primaries and elections  The Act also placed limits of  5 000 per campaign on PACs  political action committees   The limits on individual contributions and prohibition of direct corporate or labor union campaigns led to a huge increase in the number of PACs  Today many labor unions and corporations have their own PACs  and over 4 000 in total exist  The 1974 amendment also specified a Federal Election Commission  created in 1975 to administer and enforce campaign finance law  Various other provisions were also included  such as a ban on contributions or expenditures by foreign nationals  incorporated from the Foreign Agents Registration Act  FARA   1966   The case of Buckley v  Valeo  1976  challenged the Act  Most provisions were upheld  but the court found that the mandatory spending limit imposed was unconstitutional  as was the limit placed on campaign spending from the candidate s personal fortune and the provision that limited independent expenditures by individuals and organizations supporting but not officially linked to a campaign  The effect of the first decision was to allow candidates such as Ross Perot and Steve Forbes to spend enormous amounts of their own money in their own campaigns  The effect of the second decision was to allow the culture of  soft money  to develop  A 1979 amendment to the Federal Election Campaign Act allowed political parties to spend without limit on get out the vote and voter registration activities conducted primarily for a presidential candidate  Later  they were permitted by FECA to use  soft money   unregulated  unlimited contributions to fund this effort  Increasingly  the money began to be spent on issue advertising  candidate specific advertising that was being funded mostly by soft money  The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 banned local and national parties from spending  soft money  and banned national party committees from accepting or spending soft money  It increased the limit of contributions by individuals from  1 000 to  2 000  It banned corporations or labor unions from funding issue advertising directly  and banned the use of corporate or labor money for advertisements that mention a federal candidate within 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary  The constitutionality of the bill was challenged and in December 2003  the Supreme Court upheld most provisions of the legislation   See McConnell v  FEC   A large number of  527 groups  were active for the first time in the 2004 election  These groups receive donations from individuals and groups and then spend the money on issue advocacy  such as the anti Kerry ads by Swift Boat Veterans For Truth  This is a new form of soft money  and not surprisingly it is controversial  Many 527 groups have close links with the Democratic or Republican Parties  even though legally they cannot coordinate their activities with them  John McCain  one of the Senators behind the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act  and President Bush have both declared a desire to ban 527s  Changing campaign finance laws is a highly controversial issue  Reformers wish to see laws changed in order to improve electoral competition and political equality  Opponents to reform wish to see the system stay as it is or with even fewer restrictions on the freedom to spend and contribute money  The Supreme Court has made it increasingly difficult for those who wish to regulate election financing  but options like partial public funding of campaigns are still possible and offer the potential to address reformers  concerns with minimal restrictions on the freedom to contribute  15   edit  Primaries and caucuses In partisan elections  candidates are chosen by primary elections  abbreviated to primaries  and caucuses in the states  the District of Columbia  Puerto Rico  American Samoa  Guam  and the U S  Virgin Islands  A primary election is an election in which registered voters in a jurisdiction  nominating primary  select a political party s candidate for a later election  There are various types of primary  either the whole electorate is eligible  and voters choose one party s primary at the polling booth  an open primary   or only independent voters can choose a party s primary at the polling booth or only registered members of the party are allowed to vote  closed primary   The blanket primary  when voters could vote for all parties  primaries on the same ballot was struck down by the United States Supreme Court as violating the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of assembly in the case California Democratic Party v  Jones  Primaries are also used to select candidates at the state level  for example in gubernatorial elections  Caucuses also nominate candidates by election  but they are very different from primaries  Caucuses are meetings that occur at precincts and involve discussion of each party s platform and issues such as voter turnout in addition to voting  Eleven states  Iowa  New Mexico  North Dakota  Maine  Nevada  Hawaii  Minnesota  Kansas  Alaska  Wyoming  Colorado and the District of Columbia use caucuses  The primary season  it refers to primaries and caucuses  in Presidential elections lasts from the Iowa caucus in January to the last primary  which was the New Jersey primary and Montana primary on 8 June in 2004  Front loading   when larger numbers of contests take place in the opening weeks of the season can have an effect on the nomination process  potentially reducing the number of realistic candidates  as fund raisers and donors quickly abandon those they see as untenable  However  it is not the case that the successful candidate is always the candidate that does the best in the early primaries  There is also a period dubbed the  invisible primary  that takes place before the primary season  when candidates attempt to solicit media coverage and funding well before the real primary season begins  For elections of Presidential candidates  political conventions are held in the summer  These conventions ratify the decisions made in the primaries and caucuses for the two major parties  and are used to select the candidate outright for some of the other political parties  In the past  these conventions were used to select the Presidential candidates for the two major parties as well  but that role has gradually receded   edit  See
