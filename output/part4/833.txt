Time travel From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search For other uses  see Time travel  disambiguation    Time machine  redirects here  For other uses  see Time machine  disambiguation   Time travel is the concept of moving between different points in time in a manner analogous to moving between different points in space  Time travel could hypothetically involve moving backward in time to a moment earlier than the starting point  or forward to the future of that point without the need for the traveler to experience the intervening period  at least not at the normal rate   Any technological device   whether fictional or hypothetical   that would be used to achieve time travel is commonly known as a time machine  1  Although time travel has been a common plot device in science fiction since the late 19th century  and the theories of special and general relativity suggest methods for forms of one way travel into the future via time dilation  it is currently unknown whether the laws of physics would allow time travel into the past  Such backward time travel would have the potential to introduce paradoxes related to causality  and a variety of hypotheses have been proposed to resolve them  as discussed in the sections Paradoxes and Rules of time travel below  Contents 1 Origins of the concept 1 1 Literature timeline 1 2 Forwards time travel

Forwards time travel There is no widespread agreement as to which written work should be recognized as the earliest example of a time travel story  since a number of early works feature elements ambiguously suggestive of time travel  Ancient folk tales and myths sometimes involved something akin to travelling forward in time  for example  in Hindu mythology  the Mahabharata mentions the story of the King Revaita  who travels to heaven to meet the creator Brahma and is shocked to learn that many ages have passed when he returns to Earth  2  3  Another one of the earliest known stories to involve traveling forwards in time to a distant future was the Japanese tale of  Urashima Tar    4  first described in the Nihongi  720   5  It was about a young fisherman named Urashima Taro who visits an undersea palace and stays there for three days  After returning home to his village  he finds himself 300 years in the future  when he is long forgotten  his house in ruins  and his family long dead  Another very old example of this type of story can be found in the Talmud with the story of Honi HaM agel who went to sleep for 70 years and woke up to a world where his grandchildren were grandparents and where all his friends and family were dead  6  Statue of Rip van Winkle in Irvington  New York More recently  Washington Irving s famous 1819 story  Rip Van Winkle  tells of a man named Rip Van Winkle who takes a nap on a mountain and wakes up 20 years in the future  when he has been forgotten  his wife dead  and his daughter grown up  4  Sleep was also used for time travel in Faddey Bulgarin s story  Pravdopodobnie Nebylitsi  in which the protagonist wakes up in the 29th century  Another more recent story involving travel to the future is Louis S bastien Mercier s L An 2440  r ve s il en f t jamais   The Year 2440  A Dream If Ever There Were One    a utopian novel in which the main character is transported to the year 2440  An extremely popular work  it went through 25 editions after its first appearance in 1771   it describes the adventures of an unnamed man who  after engaging in a heated discussion with a philosopher friend about the injustices of Paris  falls asleep and finds himself in a Paris of the future  Robert Darnton writes that  despite its self proclaimed character of fantasy   L An 2440 demanded to be read as a serious guidebook to the future   7   edit  Backwards time travel Backwards time travel seems to be a more modern idea  but its origin is also somewhat ambiguous  One early story with hints of backwards time travel is Memoirs of the Twentieth Century  1733  by Samuel Madden  which is mainly a series of letters from English ambassadors in various countries to the British Lord High Treasurer  along with a few replies from the British Foreign Office  all purportedly written in 1997 and 1998 and describing the conditions of that era  8  However  the framing story is that these letters were actual documents given to the narrator by his guardian angel one night in 1728  for this reason  Paul Alkon suggests in his book Origins of Futuristic Fiction that  the first time traveler in English literature is a guardian angel who returns with state documents from 1998 to the year 1728   9  although the book does not explicitly show how the angel obtained these documents  Alkon later qualifies this by writing   It would be stretching our generosity to praise Madden for being the first to show a traveler arriving from the future   but also says that Madden  deserves recognition as the first to toy with the rich idea of time travel in the form of an artifact sent backwards from the future to be discovered in the present   8  Mr  and Mrs  Fezziwig dance in a vision the Ghost of Christmas Past shows Scrooge  In 1836 Alexander Veltman published Predki Kalimerosa  Aleksandr Filippovich Makedonskii  The forebears of Kalimeros  Alexander  son of Philip of Macedon   which has been called the first original Russian science fiction novel and the first novel to use time travel  10  In it the narrator rides to ancient Greece on a hippogriff  meets Aristotle  and goes on a voyage with Alexander the Great before returning to the 19th century  In the science fiction anthology Far Boundaries  1951   the editor August Derleth identifies the short story  Missing One s Coach  An Anachronism   written for the Dublin Literary Magazine 11  by an anonymous author in 1838  as a very early time travel story  12  In this story  the narrator is waiting under a tree to be picked up by a coach which will take him out of Newcastle  when he suddenly finds himself transported back over a thousand years  He encounters the Venerable Bede in a monastery  and gives him somewhat ironic explanations of the developments of the coming centuries  It is never entirely clear whether these events actually occurred or were merely a dream the narrator says that when he initially found a comfortable looking spot in the roots of the tree  he sat down   and as my sceptical reader will tell me  nodded and slept   but then says that he is  resolved not to admit  this explanation  A number of dreamlike elements of the story may suggest otherwise to the reader  such as the fact that none of the members of the monastery seem to be able to see him at first  and the abrupt ending in which Bede has been delayed talking to the narrator and so the other monks burst in thinking that some harm has come to him  and suddenly the narrator finds himself back under the tree in the present  August 1837   with his coach having just passed his spot on the road  leaving him stranded in Newcastle for another night  13  Charles Dickens  1843 book A Christmas Carol is considered by some 14  to be one of the first depictions of time travel in both directions  as the main character  Ebenezer Scrooge  is transported to Christmases past  present and yet to come  These might be considered mere visions rather than actual time travel  though  since Scrooge only viewed each time period passively  unable to interact with them  A more clear example of backwards time travel is found in the popular 1861 book Paris avant les hommes  Paris before Men  by the French botanist and geologist Pierre Boitard  published posthumously  In this story the main character is transported into the prehistoric past by the magic of a  lame demon   a French pun on Boitard s name   where he encounters such extinct animals as a Plesiosaur  as well as Boitard s imagined version of an apelike human ancestor  and is able to actively interact with some of them  15  Another early example of backwards time travel in fiction is the short story The Clock That Went Backward by Edward Page Mitchell  16  which appeared in the New York Sun in 1881  Mark Twain s A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur s Court  1889   in which the protagonist finds himself in the time of King Arthur after a fight in which he is hit with a sledge hammer  was another early time travel story which helped bring the concept to a wide audience  and was also one of the first stories to show history being changed by the time traveler s actions  The first time travel story to feature time travel by means of a time machine was Enrique Gaspar y Rimbau s 1887 book El Anacron pete  17  This idea gained popularity with the H  G  Wells story The Time Machine  published in 1895  preceded by a less influential story of time travel Wells wrote in 1888  titled The Chronic Argonauts   which also featured a time machine and which is often seen as an inspiration for all later science fiction stories featuring time travel using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposefully and selectively  The term  time machine   coined by Wells  is now universally used to refer to such a vehicle  Since that time  both science and fiction  see Time travel in fiction  have expanded on the concept of time travel   edit  Theory Some theories  most notably special and general relativity  suggest that suitable geometries of spacetime  or specific types of motion in space  might allow time travel into the past and future if these geometries or motions are possible  18  In technical papers  physicists generally avoid the commonplace language of  moving  or  traveling  through time   movement  normally refers only to a change in spatial position as the time coordinate is varied   and instead discuss the possibility of closed timelike curves  which are worldlines that form closed loops in spacetime  allowing objects to return to their own past  There are known to be solutions to the equations of general relativity that describe spacetimes which contain closed timelike curves  such as G del spacetime   but the physical plausibility of these solutions is uncertain  Relativity predicts that if one were to move away from the Earth at relativistic velocities and return  more time would have passed on Earth than for the traveler  so in this sense it is accepted that relativity allows  travel into the future   according to relativity there is no single objective answer to how much time has really passed between the departure and the return  but there is an objective answer to how much proper time has been experienced by both the Earth and the traveler  i e   how much each has aged  see twin paradox   On the other hand  many in the scientific community believe that backwards time travel is highly unlikely  Any theory that would allow time travel would require that problems of causality be resolved  The classic example of a problem involving causality is the  grandfather paradox   what if one were to go back in time and kill one s own grandfather before one s father was conceived  But some scientists believe that paradoxes can be avoided  by appealing either to the Novikov self consistency principle or to the notion of branching parallel universes  see the  Paradoxes  section below    edit  Tourism in time Stephen Hawking once suggested that the absence of tourists from the future is an argument against the existence of time travel a variant of the Fermi paradox  Of course this would not prove that time travel is physically impossible  since it might be that time travel is physically possible but that it is never developed  or is cautiously never used   and even if it is developed  Hawking notes elsewhere that time travel might only be possible in a region of spacetime that is warped in the correct way  and that if we cannot create such a region until the future  then time travelers would not be able to travel back before that date  so  This picture would explain why we haven t been over run by tourists from the future   19 Carl Sagan also once suggested the possibility that time travelers could be here  but are disguising their existence or are not recognized as time travelers  20   edit  General relativity However  the theory of general relativity does suggest a scientific basis for the possibility of backwards time travel in certain unusual scenarios  although arguments from semiclassical gravity suggest that when quantum effects are incorporated into general relativity  these loopholes may be closed  21  These semiclassical arguments led Hawking to formulate the chronology protection conjecture  suggesting that the fundamental laws of nature prevent time travel  22  but physicists cannot come to a definite judgment on the issue without a theory of quantum gravity to join quantum mechanics and general relativity into a completely unified theory  23   edit  In physics Time travel to the past is theoretically allowed using the following methods  24  Travelling faster than the speed of light The use of cosmic strings and black holes Wormholes and Alcubierre drive  edit  Via faster than light  FTL  travel If one were able to move information or matter from one point to another faster than light  then according to special relativity  there would be some inertial frame of reference in which the signal or object was moving backward in time  This is a consequence of the relativity of simultaneity in special relativity  which says that in some cases different reference frames will disagree on whether two events at different locations happened  at the same time  or not  and they can also disagree on the order of the two events  technically  these disagreements occur when the spacetime interval between the events is  space like   meaning that neither event lies in the future light cone of the other   25  If one of the two events represents the sending of a signal from one location and the second event represents the reception of the same signal at another location  then as long as the signal is moving at the speed of light or slower  the mathematics of simultaneity ensures that all reference frames agree that the transmission event happened before the reception event  25  However  in the case of a hypothetical signal moving faster than light  there would always be some frames in which the signal was received before it was sent  so that the signal could be said to have moved backwards in time  And since one of the two fundamental postulates of special relativity says that the laws of physics should work the same way in every inertial frame  then if it is possible for signals to move backwards in time in any one frame  it must be possible in all frames  This means that if observer A sends a signal to observer B which moves FTL  faster than light  in A s frame but backwards in time in B s frame  and then B sends a reply which moves FTL in B s frame but backwards in time in A s frame  it could work out that A receives the reply before sending the original signal  a clear violation of causality in every frame  An illustration of such a scenario using spacetime diagrams can be found here  26  The scenario is sometimes referred to as a tachyonic antitelephone  According to special relativity  it would take an infinite amount of energy to accelerate a slower than light object to the speed of light  Although relativity does not forbid the theoretical possibility of tachyons which move faster than light at all times  when analyzed using quantum field theory  it seems that it would not actually be possible to use them to transmit information faster than light  27  There is also no widely agreed upon evidence for the existence of tachyons  the faster than light neutrino anomaly could possibly indicate that neutrinos are tachyons  but the results of the experiment have not yet been independently confirmed  Another group of experimenters state that a lack of radiation posited by a theory indicates the neutrinos cannot have really been traveling faster than light  28  The OPERA team leader  Dario Autiero  and CERN s research director  Sergio Bertolucci  note other explanations are possible for the lack of neutrino energy loss via radiation  29  30   edit  Special spacetime geometries The general theory of relativity extends the special theory to cover gravity  illustrating it in terms of curvature in spacetime caused by mass energy and the flow of momentum  General relativity describes the universe under a system of field equations  and there exist solutions to these equations that permit what are called  closed time like curves   and hence time travel into the past  18  The first of these was proposed by Kurt G del  a solution known as the G del metric  but his  and many others   example requires the universe to have physical characteristics that it does not appear to have  18  Whether general relativity forbids closed time like curves for all realistic conditions is unknown   edit  Using wormholes Main article  Wormhole Wormholes are a hypothetical warped spacetime which are also permitted by the Einstein field equations of general relativity  31  although it would be impossible to travel through a wormhole unless it were what is known as a traversable wormhole  A proposed time travel machine using a traversable wormhole would  hypothetically  work in the following way  One end of the wormhole is accelerated to some significant fraction of the speed of light  perhaps with some advanced propulsion system  and then brought back to the point of origin  Alternatively  another way is to take one entrance of the wormhole and move it to within the gravitational field of an object that has higher gravity than the other entrance  and then return it to a position near the other entrance  For both of these methods  time dilation causes the end of the wormhole that has been moved to have aged less than the stationary end  as seen by an external observer  however  time connects differently through the wormhole than outside it  so that synchronized clocks at either end of the wormhole will always remain synchronized as seen by an observer passing through the wormhole  no matter how the two ends move around  32  This means that an observer entering the accelerated end would exit the stationary end when the stationary end was the same age that the accelerated end had been at the moment before entry  for example  if prior to entering the wormhole the observer noted that a clock at the accelerated end read a date of 2007 while a clock at the stationary end read 2012  then the observer would exit the stationary end when its clock also read 2007  a trip backwards in time as seen by other observers outside  One significant limitation of such a time machine is that it is only possible to go as far back in time as the initial creation of the machine  33  in essence  it is more of a path through time than it is a device that itself moves through time  and it would not allow the technology itself to be moved backwards in time  This could provide an alternative explanation for Hawking s observation  a time machine will be built someday  but has not yet been built  so the tourists from the future cannot reach this far back in time  According to current theories on the nature of wormholes  construction of a traversable wormhole would require the existence of a substance with negative energy  often referred to as  exotic matter    More technically  the wormhole spacetime requires a distribution of energy that violates various energy conditions  such as the null energy condition along with the weak  strong  and dominant energy conditions  34  However  it is known that quantum effects can lead to small measurable violations of the null energy condition  34  and many physicists believe that the required negative energy may actually be possible due to the Casimir effect in quantum physics  35  Although early calculations suggested a very large amount of negative energy would be required  later calculations showed that the amount of negative energy can be made arbitrarily small  36  In 1993  Matt Visser argued that the two mouths of a wormhole with such an induced clock difference could not be brought together without inducing quantum field and gravitational effects that would either make the wormhole collapse or the two mouths repel each other  37  Because of this  the two mouths could not be brought close enough for causality violation to take place  However  in a 1997 paper  Visser hypothesized that a complex  Roman ring   named after Tom Roman  configuration of an N number of wormholes arranged in a symmetric polygon could still act as a time machine  although he concludes that this is more likely a flaw in classical quantum gravity theory rather than proof that causality violation is possible  38   edit  Other approaches based on general relativity Another approach involves a dense spinning cylinder usually referred to as a Tipler cylinder  a GR solution discovered by Willem Jacob van Stockum 39  in 1936 and Kornel Lanczos 40  in 1924  but not recognized as allowing closed timelike curves 41  until an analysis by Frank Tipler 42  in 1974  If a cylinder is infinitely long and spins fast enough about its long axis  then a spaceship flying around the cylinder on a spiral path could travel back in time  or forward  depending on the direction of its spiral   However  the density and speed required is so great that ordinary matter is not strong enough to construct it  A similar device might be built from a cosmic string  but none are known to exist  and it does not seem to be possible to create a new cosmic string  Physicist Robert Forward noted that a na ve application of general relativity to quantum mechanics suggests another way to build a time machine  A heavy atomic nucleus in a strong magnetic field would elongate into a cylinder  whose density and  spin  are enough to build a time machine  Gamma rays projected at it might allow information  not matter  to be sent back in time  however  he pointed out that until we have a single theory combining relativity and quantum mechanics  we will have no idea whether such speculations are nonsense  citation needed  A more fundamental objection to time travel schemes based on rotating cylinders or cosmic strings has been put forward by Stephen Hawking  who proved a theorem showing that according to general relativity it is impossible to build a time machine of a special type  a  time machine with the compactly generated Cauchy horizon   in a region where the weak energy condition is satisfied  meaning that the region contains no matter with negative energy density  exotic matter   Solutions such as Tipler s assume cylinders of infinite length  which are easier to analyze mathematically  and although Tipler suggested that a finite cylinder might produce closed timelike curves if the rotation rate were fast enough  43  he did not prove this  But Hawking points out that because of his theorem   it can t be done with positive energy density everywhere  I can prove that to build a finite time machine  you need negative energy   44  This result comes from Hawking s 1992 paper on the chronology protection conjecture  where he examines  the case that the causality violations appear in a finite region of spacetime without curvature singularities  and proves that   t here will be a Cauchy horizon that is compactly generated and that in general contains one or more closed null geodesics which will be incomplete  One can define geometrical quantities that measure the Lorentz boost and area increase on going round these closed null geodesics  If the causality violation developed from a noncompact initial surface  the averaged weak energy condition must be violated on the Cauchy horizon   45  However  this theorem does not rule out the possibility of time travel 1  by means of time machines with the non compactly generated Cauchy horizons  such as the Deutsch Politzer time machine  and 2  in regions which contain exotic matter  which would be necessary for traversable wormholes or the Alcubierre drive   Because the theorem is based on general relativity  it is also conceivable a future theory of quantum gravity which replaced general relativity would allow time travel even without exotic matter  though it is also possible such a theory would place even more restrictions on time travel  or rule it out completely as postulated by Hawking s chronology protection conjecture    edit  Experiments carried out Certain experiments carried out give the impression of reversed causality but are interpreted in a different way by the scientific community  For example  in the delayed choice quantum eraser experiment performed by Marlan Scully  pairs of entangled photons are divided into  signal photons  and  idler photons   with the signal photons emerging from one of two locations and their position later measured as in the double slit experiment  and depending on how the idler photon is measured  the experimenter can either learn which of the two locations the signal photon emerged from or  erase  that information  Even though the signal photons can be measured before the choice has been made about the idler photons  the choice seems to retroactively determine whether or not an interference pattern is observed when one correlates measurements of idler photons to the corresponding signal photons  However  since interference can only be observed after the idler photons are measured and they are correlated with the signal photons  there is no way for experimenters to tell what choice will be made in advance just by looking at the signal photons  and under most interpretations of quantum mechanics the results can be explained in a way that does not violate causality  The experiment of Lijun Wang might also show causality violation since it made it possible to send packages of waves through a bulb of caesium gas in such a way that the package appeared to exit the bulb 62 nanoseconds before its entry  But a wave package is not a single well defined object but rather a sum of multiple waves of different frequencies  see Fourier analysis   and the package can appear to move faster than light or even backwards in time even if none of the pure waves in the sum do so  This effect cannot be used to send any matter  energy  or information faster than light  46  so this experiment is understood not to violate causality either  The physicists G nter Nimtz and Alfons Stahlhofen  of the University of Koblenz  claim to have violated Einstein s theory of relativity by transmitting photons faster than the speed of light  They say they have conducted an experiment in which microwave photons   energetic packets of light   traveled  instantaneously  between a pair of prisms that had been moved up to 3 ft  0 91 m  apart  using a phenomenon known as quantum tunneling  Nimtz told New Scientist magazine   For the time being  this is the only violation of special relativity that I know of   However  other physicists say that this phenomenon does not allow information to be transmitted faster than light  Aephraim Steinberg  a quantum optics expert at the University of Toronto  Canada  uses the analogy of a train traveling from Chicago to New York  but dropping off train cars at each station along the way  so that the center of the train moves forward at each stop  in this way  the center of the train exceeds the speed of any of the individual cars  47  Some physicists have performed experiments which attempted to show causality violations  but so far without success  The  Space time Twisting by Light   STL  experiment run by physicist Ronald Mallett attempts to observe a violation of causality when a neutron is passed through a circle made up of a laser whose path has been twisted by passing it through a photonic crystal  Mallett has some physical arguments that suggest that closed timelike curves would become possible through the center of a laser which has been twisted into a loop  However  other physicists dispute his arguments  see objections   Shengwang Du claims in a peer reviewed journal to have observed single photons  precursors  saying that they travel no faster than c in a vacuum  His experiment involved slow light as well as passing light through a vacuum  He generated two single photons  passing one through rubidium atoms that had been cooled with a laser  thus slowing the light  and passing one through a vacuum  Both times  apparently  the precursors preceded the photons  main bodies  and the precursor traveled at c in a vacuum  According to Du  this implies that there is no possibility of light traveling faster than c  and  thus  violating causality   48   Some members of the media took this as an indication of proof that time travel was impossible  49  50    edit  Non physics based experiments Several experiments have been carried out to try to entice future humans  who might invent time travel technology  to come back and demonstrate it to people of the present time  Events such as Perth s Destination Day  2005  or MIT s Time Traveler Convention heavily publicized permanent  advertisements  of a meeting time and place for future time travelers to meet  Back in 1982  a group in Baltimore  MD   identifying itself as the Krononauts  hosted an event of this type welcoming visitors from the future  51  52  These experiments only stood the possibility of generating a positive result demonstrating the existence of time travel  but have failed so far no time travelers are known to have attended either event  It is hypothetically possible that future humans have traveled back in time  but have traveled back to the meeting time and place in a parallel universe  53  Another factor is that for all the time travel devices considered under current physics  such as those that operate using wormholes   it is impossible to travel back to before the time machine was actually made  54  55   edit  Time travel to the future in physics Twin paradox diagram There are various ways in which a person could  travel into the future  in a limited sense  the person could set things up so that in a small amount of his own subjective time  a large amount of subjective time has passed for other people on Earth  For example  an observer might take a trip away from the Earth and back at relativistic velocities  with the trip only lasting a few years according to the observer s own clocks  and return to find that thousands of years had passed on Earth  It should be noted  though  that according to relativity there is no objective answer to the question of how much time  really  passed during the trip  it would be equally valid to say that the trip had lasted only a few years or that the trip had lasted thousands of years  depending on your choice of reference frame  This form of  travel into the future  is theoretically allowed  and has been demonstrated at very small time scales  using the following methods  24  Using velocity based time dilation under the theory of special relativity  for instance  Traveling at almost the speed of light to a distant star  then slowing down  turning around  and traveling at almost the speed of light back to Earth 56   see the Twin paradox  Using gravitational time dilation under the theory of general relativity  for instance  Residing inside of a hollow  high mass object  Residing just outside of the event horizon of a black hole  or sufficiently near an object whose mass or density causes the gravitational time dilation near it to be larger than the time dilation factor on Earth  Additionally  it might be possible to see the distant future of the Earth using methods which do not involve relativity at all  although it is even more debatable whether these should be deemed a form of  time travel   Hibernation Suspended animation  edit  Time dilation Transversal time dilation Main article  Time dilation Time dilation is permitted by Albert Einstein s special and general theories of relativity  These theories state that  relative to a given observer  time passes more slowly for bodies moving quickly relative to that observer  or bodies that are deeper within a gravity well  57  For example  a clock which is moving relative to the observer will be measured to run slow in that observer s rest frame  as a clock approaches the speed of light it will almost slow to a stop  although it can never quite reach light speed so it will never completely stop  For two clocks moving inertially  not accelerating  relative to one another  this effect is reciprocal  with each clock measuring the other to be ticking slower  However  the symmetry is broken if one clock accelerates  as in the twin paradox where one twin stays on Earth while the other travels into space  turns around  which involves acceleration   and returns in this case both agree the traveling twin has aged less  General relativity states that time dilation effects also occur if one clock is deeper in a gravity well than the other  with the clock deeper in the well ticking more slowly  this effect must be taken into account when calibrating the clocks on the satellites of the Global Positioning System  and it could lead to significant differences in rates of aging for observers at different distances from a black hole  It has been calculated that  under general relativity  a person could travel forward in time at a rate four times that of distant observers by residing inside a spherical shell with a diameter of 5 meters and the mass of Jupiter  24  For such a person  every one second of their  personal  time would correspond to four seconds for distant observers  Of course  squeezing the mass of a large planet into such a structure is not expected to be within our technological capabilities in the near future  There is a great deal of experimental evidence supporting the validity of equations for velocity based time dilation in special relativity 58  and gravitational time dilation in general relativity  59  60  61  However  with current technologies it is only possible to cause a human traveller to age less than companions on Earth by a very small fraction of a second  the current record being about 20 milliseconds for the cosmonaut Sergei Avdeyev   edit  Time perception Time perception can be apparently sped up for living organisms through hibernation  where the body temperature and metabolic rate of the creature is reduced  A more extreme version of this is suspended animation  where the rates of chemical processes in the subject would be severely reduced  Time dilation and suspended animation only allow  travel  to the future  never the past  so they do not violate causality  and it s debatable whether they should be called time travel  However time dilation can be viewed as a better fit for our understanding of the term  time travel  than suspended animation  since with time dilation less time actually does pass for the traveler than for those who remain behind  so the traveler can be said to have reached the future faster than others  whereas with suspended animation this is not the case   edit  Other ideas from mainstream physics  edit  Paradoxes The Novikov self consistency principle and calculations by Kip S  Thorne citation needed  indicate that simple masses passing through time travel wormholes could never engender paradoxes there are no initial conditions that lead to paradox once time travel is introduced  If his results can be generalized  they would suggest  curiously  that none of the supposed paradoxes formulated in time travel stories can actually be formulated at a precise physical level  that is  that any situation you can set up in a time travel story turns out to permit many consistent solutions  The circumstances might  however  turn out to be almost unbelievably strange  citation needed  Parallel universes might provide a way out of paradoxes  Everett s many worlds interpretation  MWI  of quantum mechanics suggests that all possible quantum events can occur in mutually exclusive histories  62  These alternate  or parallel  histories would form a branching tree symbolizing all possible outcomes of any interaction  If all possibilities exist  any paradoxes could be explained by having the paradoxical events happening in a different universe  This concept is most often used in science fiction  but some physicists such as David Deutsch have suggested that if time travel is possible and the MWI is correct  then a time traveler should indeed end up in a different history than the one he started from  63  64  On the other hand  Stephen Hawking has argued that even if the MWI is correct  we should expect each time traveler to experience a single self consistent history  so that time travelers remain within their own world rather than traveling to a different one  19  And the physicist Allen Everett argued that Deutsch s approach  involves modifying fundamental principles of quantum mechanics  it certainly goes beyond simply adopting the MWI   Everett also argues that even if Deutsch s approach is correct  it would imply that any macroscopic object composed of multiple particles would be split apart when traveling back in time through a wormhole  with different particles emerging in different worlds  65  Daniel Greenberger and Karl Svozil proposed that quantum theory gives a model for time travel without paradoxes  66  67  In quantum theory observation causes possible states to  collapse  into one measured state  hence  the past observed from the present is deterministic  it has only one possible state   but the present observed from the past has many possible states until our actions cause it to collapse into one state  Our actions will then be seen to have been inevitable   edit  Using quantum entanglement Quantum mechanical phenomena such as quantum teleportation  the EPR paradox  or quantum entanglement might appear to create a mechanism that allows for faster than light  FTL  communication or time travel  and in fact some interpretations of quantum mechanics such as the Bohm interpretation presume that some information is being exchanged between particles instantaneously in order to maintain correlations between particles  68  This effect was referred to as  spooky action at a distance  by Einstein  Nevertheless  the fact that causality is preserved in quantum mechanics is a rigorous result in modern quantum field theories  and therefore modern theories do not allow for time travel or FTL communication  In any specific instance where FTL has been claimed  more detailed analysis has proven that to get a signal  some form of classical communication must also be used  69  The no communication theorem also gives a general proof that quantum entanglement cannot be used to transmit information faster than classical signals  The fact that these quantum phenomena apparently do not allow FTL time travel is often overlooked in popular press coverage of quantum teleportation experiments  citation needed  How the rules of quantum mechanics work to preserve causality is an active area of research  citation needed   edit  Philosophical understandings of time travel Main article  Philosophy of space and time Theories of time travel are riddled with questions about causality and paradoxes  Compared to other fundamental concepts in modern physics  time is still not understood very well  Philosophers have been theorizing about the nature of time since the era of the ancient Greek philosophers and earlier  Some philosophers and physicists who study the nature of time also study the possibility of time travel and its logical implications  The probability of paradoxes and their possible solutions are often considered  For more information on the philosophical considerations of time travel  consult the work of David Lewis or Ted Sider  For more information on physics related theories of time travel  consider the work of Kurt G del  especially his theorized universe  and Lawrence Sklar   edit  Presentism vs  eternalism The relativity of simultaneity in modern physics favors the philosophical view known as eternalism or four dimensionalism  Sider  2001   in which physical objects are either temporally extended spacetime worms  or spacetime worm stages  and this view would be favored further by the possibility of time travel  Sider  2001   Eternalism  also sometimes known as  block universe theory   builds on a standard method of modeling time as a dimension in physics  to give time a similar ontology to that of space  Sider  2001   This would mean that time is just another dimension  that future events are  already there   and that there is no objective flow of time  This view is disputed by Tim Maudlin in his The Metaphysics Within Physics  Presentism is a school of philosophy that holds that neither the future nor the past exist  and there are no non present objects  In this view  time travel is impossible because there is no future or past to travel to  However  some 21st century presentists have argued that although past and future objects do not exist  there can still be definite truths about past and future events  and thus it is possible that a future truth about a time traveler deciding to travel back to the present date could explain the time traveler s actual appearance in the present  70  71   edit  The grandfather paradox Main article  Grandfather paradox One subject often brought up in philosophical discussion of time is the idea that  if one were to go back in time  paradoxes could ensue if the time traveler were to change things  The best examples of this are the grandfather paradox and the idea of autoinfanticide  The grandfather paradox is a hypothetical situation in which a time traveler goes back in time and attempts to kill his grandfather at a time before his grandfather met his grandmother  If he did so  then his mother or father never would have been born  and neither would the time traveler himself  in which case the time traveler never would have gone back in time to kill his grandfather  Autoinfanticide works the same way  where a traveler goes back and attempts to kill himself as an infant  If he were to do so  he never would have grown up to go back in time to kill himself as an infant  This discussion is important to the philosophy of time travel because philosophers question whether these paradoxes make time travel impossible  Some philosophers answer the paradoxes by arguing that it might be the case that backwards time travel could be possible but that it would be impossible to actually change the past in any way  72  an idea similar to the proposed Novikov self consistency principle in physics   edit  Theory of compossibility David Lewis s analysis of compossibility and the implications of changing the past is meant to account for the possibilities of time travel in a one dimensional conception of time without creating logical paradoxes  Consider Lewis  example of Tim  Tim hates his grandfather and would like nothing more than to kill him  The only problem for Tim is that his grandfather died years ago  Tim wants so badly to kill his grandfather himself that he constructs a time machine to travel back to 1955 when his grandfather was young and kill him then  Assuming that Tim can travel to a time when his grandfather is still alive  the question must then be raised  can Tim kill his grandfather  For Lewis  the answer lies within the context of the usage of the word  can   Lewis explains that the word  can  must be viewed against the context of pertinent facts relating to the situation  Suppose that Tim has a rifle  years of rifle training  a straight shot on a clear day and no outside force to restrain Tim s trigger finger  Can Tim shoot his grandfather  Considering these facts  it would appear that Tim can in fact kill his grandfather  In other words  all of the contextual facts are compossible with Tim killing his grandfather  However  when reflecting on the compossibility of a given situation  we must gather the most inclusive set of facts that we are able to  Consider now the fact that Tim s grandfather died in 1993 and not in 1955  This new fact about Tim s situation reveals that him killing his grandfather is not compossible with the current set of facts  Tim cannot kill his grandfather because his grandfather died in 1993 and not when he was young  Thus  Lewis concludes  the statements  Tim doesn t but can  because he has what it takes   and   Tim doesn t  and can t  because it is logically impossible to change the past   are not contradictions  they are both true given the relevant set of facts  The usage of the word  can  is equivocal  he  can  and  can not  under different relevant facts  So what must happen to Tim as he takes aim  Lewis believes that his gun will jam  a bird will fly in the way  or Tim simply slips on a banana peel  Either way  there will be some logical force of the universe that will prevent Tim every time from killing his grandfather  73   edit  Ideas from fiction Further information  Time travel in fiction  edit  Rules of time travel Time travel themes in science fiction and the media can generally be grouped into two general categories  based on effect methods are extremely varied and numerous   each of which can be further subdivided  74  75  76  77  However  there are no formal names for these two categories  so concepts rather than formal names will be used with notes regarding what categories they are placed under  Note  These classifications do not address the method of time travel itself  i e  how to travel through time  but instead call to attention differing rules of what happens to history    As used in this section  timeline refers to all physical events in history  so that in time travel stories where events can be changed  the time traveler can create a new or altered timeline  This usage of  timeline  is fairly common in time travel fiction  1  and is distinct from the usage of  timeline  to refer to a type of chart created by humans to illustrate a particular series of events  see timeline   This concept is also distinct from the concept of a world line  a term from Einstein s theory of relativity which refers to the entire history of a single object  usually idealized as a point particle  that forms a distinct path through 4 dimensional spacetime  1  There is a single fixed history  which is self consistent and unchangeable  In this version  everything happens on a single timeline which does not contradict itself and cannot interact with anything potentially existing outside of it  A man travelling a few seconds into the past in a single self consistent timeline  This scenario raises questions about free will  since once the traveller has decided to enter the time machine  then as soon as his own double appears  there is absolutely no way for him to change his mind  1 1 This can be simply achieved by applying the Novikov self consistency principle  named after Dr  Igor Dmitrievich Novikov  Professor of Astrophysics at Copenhagen University  The principle states that the timeline is totally fixed  and any actions taken by a time traveler were part of history all along  so it is impossible for the time traveler to  change  history in any way  The time traveler s actions may be the cause of events in their own past though  which leads to the potential for circular causation and the predestination paradox  for examples of circular causation  see Robert A  Heinlein s story  By His Bootstraps   The Novikov self consistency principle proposes that the local laws of physics in a region of spacetime containing time travelers cannot be any different from the local laws of physics in any other region of spacetime  78  An example of such kind of time travel occurs in the japanese light novel and anime The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya  In this story  every time a time traveler has to go back in the past  he or she gets the feeling he should make sure everything happens exactly as it is remembered  No indication is given about what would happen otherwise  though  Also  in the first episode of the second season  an apparent causal loop is noticed  which is then explained by a reformulation of G del s theorem  1 2 Alternatively  new physical laws take effect regarding time travel that thwarts attempts to change the past  contradicting the assumption mentioned in 1 1 above that the laws that apply to time travelers are the same ones that apply to everyone else   These new physical laws can be as unsubtle as to reject time travelers who travel to the past to change it by pulling them back to the point from when they came as Michael Moorcock s The Dancers at the End of Time or where the traveler is rendered a noncorporeal phantom unable to physically interact with the past such as in some Pre Crisis Superman stories and Michael Garrett s  Brief Encounter  in Twilight Zone Magazine May 1981  2  History is flexible and is subject to change  Plastic Time  2 1 Changes to history are easy and can impact the traveler  the world  or both Examples include Doctor Who and the Back to the Future trilogy  In some cases  any resulting paradoxes can be devastating  threatening the very existence of the universe  In other cases the traveler simply cannot return home  The extreme version of this  Chaotic Time  is that history is very sensitive to changes with even small changes having large impacts such as in Ray Bradbury s  A Sound of Thunder   2 2 History is change resistant in direct relationship to the importance of the event ie  small trivial events can be readily changed but large ones take great effort  In the Twilight Zone episode  Back There  a traveler tries to prevent the assassination of President Lincoln and fails  but his actions have made subtle changes to the status quo in his own time  e g  a man who had been the butler of his gentleman s club is now a rich tycoon   In the 2002 remake of The Time Machine  it is explained via a vision why Hartdegen could not save his sweetheart Emma doing so would have resulted in his never developing the time machine he used to try and save her  In The Saga of Darren Shan  major events in the past cannot be changed  but their details can alter while providing the same outcome  Under this model  if a time traveler were to go back in time and kill Hitler  another Nazi would simply take his place and commit his same actions  leaving the broader course of history unchanged  In the Doctor Who episode The Waters of Mars  Captain Adelaide Brooke s death on Mars is the most singular catalyst of human travel outside the solar system  At first  the Doctor realizes her death is a  fixed point in time  and does not intervene  but later defies this rule and transports her and her crew to Earth  Rather than allow human history to change  Captain Brooke commits suicide on Earth  leaving history mostly unchanged  Time travel under the parallel universe hypothesis  This scenario has the potential to preserve free will  but breaks symmetry between universes  3  Alternate timelines  In this version of time travel  there are multiple coexisting alternate histories  so that when the traveler goes back in time  he she ends up in a new timeline where historical events can differ from the timeline he she came from  but her original timeline does not cease to exist  this means the grandfather paradox can be avoided since even if the time traveler s grandfather is killed at a young age in the new timeline  he still survived to have children in the original timeline  so there is still a causal explanation for the traveler s existence   Time travel may actually create a new timeline that diverges from the original timeline at the moment the time traveler appears in the past  or the traveler may arrive in an already existing parallel universe  though unless the parallel universe s history was identical to the time traveler s history up until the point where the time traveler appeared  it is questionable whether the latter version qualifies as  time travel    James P  Hogan s The Proteus Operation fully explains parallel universe time travel in chapter 20 where it has Einstein explaining that all the outcomes already exist and all time travel does is change which already existing branch you will experience  Though Star Trek has a long tradition of using the 2 1 mechanic  as seen in  The City on the Edge of Forever    Tomorrow is Yesterday    Time and Again    Future s End    Before and After    Endgame  and as late as Enterprise s Temporal Cold War   Parallels  had an example of what Data called  quantum realities   His exact words on the matter were  But there is a theory in quantum physics that all possibilities that can happen do happen in alternate quantum realities   suggesting the writers were thinking of the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics  Michael Crichton s novel Timeline takes the approach that all time travel really is travel to an already existing parallel universe where time passes at a slower rate than our own but actions in any of these parallel universes may have already occurred in our past  It is unclear from the novel if any sizable change in events of these parallel universe can be made  In the Homeline setting of GURPS Infinite Worlds there are echos parallel universes at an early part of Homeline s history but changes to their history do not affect Homeline s history  However tampering with their history can cause them to shift quanta making access harder if not impossible  A type of story which could be placed in this category is one where the alternative version of the past lies not in some other dimension  but simply at a distant location in space or a future period of time that replicates conditions in the traveler s past  For example  in a Futurama episode called The Late Philip J  Fry  the professor designed a forward only time travel device  Trapped in the future  he and two colleagues travel forward all the way to the end of the universe  at which point they witness a new Big Bang which gives rise to a new universe whose history mirrors their own history  Then they continue to go forward until they reach the exact time of their initial departure  Although this journey is not exactly a backward time travel  the final result is the same  In the Japanese manga  Dragon Ball Z  the character Trunks travels back in time to warn the characters of their deaths soon to come  This does not change his time line  only creates a new one in which they do not die  Soon two of the characters destroy the lab where the monster Cell is being created  stopping him from absorbing the androids  creating a third time line  Later it is revealed that Trunks is killed by Cell in the future  then travels to three years before any of the events occurs  which creates a fourth time line  No matter what any character does in the past  their own original time line is unchanged   edit  Immutable timelines Time travel in a type 1 universe does not allow paradoxes such as the grandfather paradox to occur  where one deduces both a conclusion and its opposite  in the case of the grandfather paradox  one can start with the premise of the time traveler killing his grandfather  and reach the conclusion that the time traveler will not be able to kill his grandfather since he was never born  though it can allow other paradoxes to occur  In 1 1  the Novikov self consistency principle asserts that the existence of a method of time travel constrains events to remain self consistent  This will cause any attempt to violate such consistency to fail  even if seemingly extremely improbable events are required  Example  You have a device that can send a single bit of information back to itself at a precise moment in time  You receive a bit at 10 00 00 p m   then no bits for thirty seconds after that  If you send a bit back to 10 00 00 p m   everything works fine  However  if you try to send a bit to 10 00 15 p m   a time at which no bit was received   your transmitter will mysteriously fail  Or your dog will distract you for fifteen seconds  Or your transmitter will appear to work  but as it turns out your receiver failed at exactly 10 00 15 p m   etc  Examples of this kind of universe are found in Robert Forward s novel Timemaster  the Twilight Zone episode  No Time Like the Past   and the 1980 Jeannot Szwarc film Somewhere In Time  based on Richard Matheson s novel Bid Time Return   In 1 2  time travel is constrained to prevent paradox  How this occurs is dependent on whether interaction with the past is possible  If interaction with the past is possible and one attempts to make a paradox  one undergoes involuntary or uncontrolled time travel  In the time travel stories of Connie Willis  time travelers encounter  slippage  which prevents them from either reaching the intended time or translates them a sufficient distance from their destination at the intended time  as to prevent any paradox from occurring  Example  A man who travels into the past with intentions to kill Hitler finds himself on a Montana farm in late April 1945  In the The Dancers at the End of Time series  Michael Moorcock invented a plot device called the Morphail Effect  This causes a time traveler to be ejected from the time in which he or she is about to cause a paradox  Example 1  A man from the End of Time period travels to the past and is executed  Instead of dying  which would cause a paradox   he experiences a return to the End of Time Example 2  Time travelers sometimes visit the End of Time from their own epochs in the past  Those that attempt to return to their own period are likely to reappear inadvertently at the End of Time  The general consequences are that time travel to the traveler s past is difficult  and many time travelers find themselves adventuring deeper and deeper into their future  If interaction with the past is not possible then the traveler simply becomes an invisible insubstantial phantom unable to interact with the past as in the case of James Harrigan in Michael Garrett s  Brief Encounter   While a Type 1 universe will prevent a grandfather paradox it doesn t prevent paradoxes in other aspects of physics such as the predestination paradox and the ontological paradox  GURPS Infinite Worlds calls this  Free Lunch Paradox    The predestination paradox is where the traveler s actions create some type of causal loop  in which some event A in the future helps cause event B in the past via time travel  and the event B in turn is one of the causes of A  For instance  a time traveler might go back to investigate a specific historical event like the Great Fire of London  and their actions in the past could then inadvertently end up being the original cause of that very event  Examples of this kind of causal loop are found in Robert Forward s novel Timemaster  the Twilight Zone episode  No Time Like the Past   EC Comics stories like  Man who was Killed in Time   Weird Science  5    Why Papa Left Home   Weird Science  11    Only Time will Tell   Weird Fantasy  1    The Connection   Weird Fantasy  9    Skeleton Key   Weird Fantasy  16   and  Counter Clockwise   Weird Fantasy  18   the 1980 Jeannot Szwarc film Somewhere In Time  based on Richard Matheson s novel Bid Time Return  the Michael Moorcock novel Behold the Man  In a scene in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban by J  K  Rowling  Harry Potter and his friend Hermione Granger are being attacked by Dementors when Harry sees somebody whom he thinks is his father come up and cast a charm to save them  Later  Harry and Hermione go back in time to save  an innocent man from a terrible fate   During the period they are back in time  Harry ends up casting the charm to save his own life  and realises that it was himself whom he saw  not his father  Casual loops are also featured in 1972 s Doctor Who  in the three part The Day of the Daleks  where three freedom fighters from the future attempt to kill a British diplomat they believe responsible for World War Three  and the subsequent easy conquest of Earth by the Daleks  In the future they were taught an explosion at the diplomat s  Sir Reginald Styles  mansion with foreign delegates inside caused the nations of the world to attack each other  The Doctor  Jon Pertwee   figures out that they caused the explosion all along by way of a temporal paradox  In the 2006 crime thriller D j  Vu there appears to be causal loops  as Agent Doug Carlin decides to send a message back in time to save his partner s life  but this will eventually cause his death  Later in the movie  though  Carlin is able to change events and create an alternate reality  This apparent paradox can be explained by multiple previous unseen time travels in a type 3 universe  In the videogame Escape from Monkey Island there s a section in which the player  controlling Guybrush Threepwood  gets some items from his future self in the Swamp of Time  Soon after that  he will become the future Guybrush and will have to give the items to his past self in the same order  This is an example of causal loop because those items were created purely from the time travel  Anyway if the player doesn t repeat every action properly  will cause a paradox that sends Guybrush back to the entrance of the swamp  implying a type 1 2 universe  A version of the ontological paradox  The appearance of the traveler is the result of his disappearance a few seconds later  In this scenario  the traveler is traveling along a closed timelike curve  The Novikov self consistency principle can also result in an ontological paradox  also known as the knowledge or information paradox  79  where the very existence of some object or information is a time loop  GURPS Infinite Worlds gives the example  from The Eyre Affair  of a time traveler going to Shakespeare s time with a book of all his works  Shakespeare pressed for time simply copies the information in the book from the future  The paradox is that nobody actually writes the plays  The philosopher Kelley L  Ross argues in  Time Travel Paradoxes  80  that in an ontological paradox scenario involving a physical object  there can be a violation of the second law of thermodynamics  Ross uses Somewhere in Time as an example where Jane Seymour s character gives Christopher Reeve s character a watch she has owned for many years  and when he travels back in time he gives the same watch to Jane Seymour s character 60 years in the past  As Ross states  The watch is an impossible object  It violates the Second Law of Thermodynamics  the Law of Entropy  If time travel makes that watch possible  then time travel itself is impossible  The watch  indeed  must be absolutely identical to itself in the 19th and 20th centuries  since Reeve carries it with him from the future instantaneously into the past and bestows it on Seymour  The watch  however  cannot be identical to itself  since all the years in which it is in the possession of Seymour and then Reeve it will wear in the normal manner  It s  sic  entropy will increase  The watch carried back by Reeve will be more worn that  sic  the watch that would have been acquired by Seymour   On the other hand  the second law of thermodynamics is understood by modern physicists to be a statistical law rather than an absolute one  so spontaneous reversals of entropy or failure to increase in entropy are not impossible  just improbable  see for example the fluctuation theorem   In addition  the second law of thermodynamics only states that entropy should increase in systems which are isolated from interactions with the external world  so Igor Novikov  creator of the Novikov self consistency principle  has argued that in the case of macroscopic objects like the watch whose worldlines form closed loops  the outside world can expend energy to repair wear entropy that the object acquires over the course of its history  so that it will be back in its original condition when it closes the loop  81   edit  Mutable timelines Time travel in a Type 2 universe is much more complex  The biggest problem is how to explain changes in the past  One method of explanation is that once the past changes  so do the memories of all observers  This would mean that no observer would ever observe the changing of the past  because they will not remember changing the past   This would make it hard to tell whether you are in a Type 1 universe or a Type 2 universe  You could  however  infer such information by knowing if a  communication with the past were possible or b  it appeared that the time line had never been changed as a result of an action someone remembers taking  although evidence exists that other people are changing their time lines fairly often  An example of this kind of universe is presented in Thrice Upon a Time  a novel by James P  Hogan  The Back to the Future trilogy films also seem to feature a single mutable timeline  see the  Back to the Future FAQ  for details on how the writers imagined time travel worked in the movies  world   By contrast  the short story  Brooklyn Project  by William Tenn provides a sketch of life in a Type 2 world where no one even notices as the timeline changes repeatedly  In type 2 1  attempts are being made at changing the timeline  however  all that is accomplished in the first tries is that the method in which decisive events occur is changed  final conclusions in the bigger scheme cannot be brought to a different outcome  As an example  the movie D j  Vu depicts a paper note sent to the past with vital information to prevent a terrorist attack  However  the vital information results in the killing of an ATF agent  but does not prevent the terrorist attack  the very same agent died in the previous version of the timeline as well  albeit under different circumstances  Finally  the timeline is changed by sending a human into the past  arguably a  stronger  measure than simply sending back a paper note  which results in preventing both a murder and the terrorist attack  As in the Back to the Future movie trilogy  there seems to be a ripple effect too as changes from the past  propagate  into the present  and people in the present have altered memory of events that occurred after the changes made to the timeline  The science fiction writer Larry Niven suggests in his essay  The Theory and Practice of Time Travel  that in a type 2 1 universe  the most efficient way for the universe to  correct  a change is for time travel to never be discovered  and that in a type 2 2 universe  the very large  or infinite  number of time travelers from the endless future will cause the timeline to change wildly until it reaches a history in which time travel is never discovered  However  many other  stable  situations might also exist in which time travel occurs but no paradoxes are created  if the changeable timeline universe finds itself in such a state no further changes will occur  and to the inhabitants of the universe it will appear identical to the type 1 1 scenario  citation needed  This is sometimes referred to as the  Time Dilution Effect   Few if any physicists or philosophers have taken seriously the possibility of  changing  the past except in the case of multiple universes  and in fact many have argued that this idea is logically incoherent  72  so the mutable timeline idea is rarely considered outside of science fiction  Also  deciding whether a given universe is of Type 2 1 or 2 2 can not be done objectively  as the categorization of timeline invasive measures as  strong  or  weak  is arbitrary  and up to interpretation  An observer can disagree about a measure being  weak   and might  in the lack of context  argue instead that simply a mishap occurred which then led to no effective change  An example would be the paper note sent back to the past in the film D j  Vu  as described above  Was it a  too weak  change  or was it just a local time alteration which had no extended effect on the larger timeline  As the universe in D j  Vu seems not entirely immune to paradoxes  some arguably minute paradoxes do occur   both versions seem to be equally possible   edit  Alternate histories In Type 3  any event that appears to have caused a paradox has instead created a new time line  The old time line remains unchanged  with the time traveler or information sent simply having vanished  never to return  A difficulty with this explanation  however  is that conservation of mass energy would be violated for the origin timeline and the destination timeline  A possible solution to this is to have the mechanics of time travel require that mass energy be exchanged in precise balance between past and future at the moment of travel  or to simply expand the scope of the conservation law to encompass all timelines  citation needed  Some examples of this kind of time travel can be found in David Gerrold s book The Man Who Folded Himself and The Time Ships by Stephen Baxter  plus several episodes which   of the TV show Star Trek  The Next Generation citation needed  and the android saga in the Japanese TV series Dragon Ball Z citation needed    edit  Gradual and instantaneous In literature  there are two methods of time travel  A gradual time travel  as in the movie Primer  When the time machine is red  everything inside is going through time at normal rate  but backwards  During entry exit it seems there would have to be fusion separation between the forward and reversed versions of the traveler  The most commonly used method of time travel in science fiction is the instantaneous movement from one point in time to another  like using the controls on a CD player to skip to a previous or next song  though in most cases  there is a machine of some sort  and some energy expended in order to make this happen  like the time traveling De Lorean in Back to the Future or the TARDIS  Time and Relative Dimension in Space  that traveled through time in Doctor Who   In some cases  there is not even the beginning of a scientific explanation for this kind of time travel  it s popular probably because it is more spectacular and makes time travel easier  The  Universal Remote  used by Adam Sandler in the movie Click works in the same manner  although only in one direction  the future  While his character Michael Newman can travel back to a previous point it is merely a playback with which he cannot interact  In The Time Machine  H G  Wells explains that we are moving through time with a constant speed  Time travel then is  in Wells  words   stopping or accelerating one s drift along the time dimension  or even turning about and traveling the other way   George Pal  director of the 1960 adaptation based on Wells s classic  accordingly chose to depict time travel by employing time lapse photography  To expand on the audio playback analogy used above  this would be like rewinding or fast forwarding an analogue audio cassette and playing the tape at a chosen point  Perhaps the oldest example of this method of time travel is in Lewis Carroll s Through the Looking Glass  1871   the White Queen is living backwards  hence her memory is working both ways  Her kind of time travel is uncontrolled  she moves through time with a constant speed of  1 and she cannot change it  T H  White  in the first part of his Arthurian novel The Once and Future King  The Sword in the Stone  1938  used the same idea  the wizard Merlyn lives backward in time  because he was born  at the wrong end of time  and has to live backwards from the front   Some people call it having second sight   he says  This method of gradual time travel is not as popular in modern science fiction  though a form of it does occur in the film Primer   edit  Time travel or spacetime travel An objection that is sometimes raised against the concept of time machines in science fiction is that they ignore the motion of the Earth between the date the time machine departs and the date it returns  The idea that a traveler can go into a machine that sends him or her to 1865 and step out into the exact same spot on Earth might be said to ignore the issue that Earth is moving through space around the Sun  which is moving in the galaxy  and so on  so that advocates of this argument imagine that  realistically  the time machine should actually reappear in space far away from the Earth s position at that date  However  the theory of relativity rejects the idea of absolute time and space  in relativity there can be no universal truth about the spatial distance between events which occur at different times 82   such as an event on Earth today and an event on Earth in 1865   and thus no objective truth about which point in space at one time is at the  same position  that the Earth was at another time  In the theory of special relativity  which deals with situations where gravity is negligible  the laws of physics work the same way in every inertial frame of reference and therefore no frame s perspective is physically better than any other frame s  and different frames disagree about whether two events at different times happened at the  same position  or  different positions   In the theory of general relativity  which incorporates the effects of gravity  all coordinate systems are on equal footing because of a feature known as  diffeomorphism invariance   83  Nevertheless  the idea that the Earth moves away from the time traveler when he takes a trip through time has been used in a few science fiction stories  such as the 2000 AD comic Strontium Dog  in which Johnny Alpha uses  Time Bombs  to propel an enemy several seconds into the future  during which time the movement of the Earth causes the unfortunate victim to re appear in space  Much earlier  Clark Ashton Smith used this form of time travel in several stories such as  The Letter from Mohaun Los   1932  where the protagonist ends up on a planet millions of years in the future which  happened to occupy the same space through which Earth had passed   Other science fiction stories try to anticipate this objection and offer a rationale for the fact that the traveler remains on Earth  such as the 1957 Robert Heinlein novel The Door into Summer where Heinlein essentially handwaved the issue with a single sentence   You stay on the world line you were on   In his 1980 novel The Number of the Beast a  continua device  allows the protagonists to dial in the coordinates of space and time and it instantly moves them there without explaining how such a device might work  The television series Seven Days also dealt with this problem  when the chrononaut would be  rewinding   he would also be propelling himself backwards around the Earth s orbit  with the intention of landing at some chosen spatial location  though seldom hitting the mark precisely  citation needed  In Piers Anthony s Bearing an Hourglass  the potent Hourglass of the Incarnation of Time naturally moves the Incarnation in space according to the numerous movements of the globe through the solar system  the solar system through the galaxy  etc   but by carefully negating some of the movements he can also travel in space within the limits of the planet  The television series Doctor Who avoided this issue by establishing early on in the series that the Doctor s TARDIS is able to move about in space in addition to traveling in time   edit  See also
