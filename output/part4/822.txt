New Wave science fiction From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search New Wave is a term applied to science fiction produced in the 1960s and 1970s and characterized by a high degree of experimentation  both in form and in content  a  literary  or artistic sensibility  and a focus on  soft  as opposed to hard science  New Wave writers often saw themselves as part of the modernist tradition and sometimes mocked the traditions of pulp science fiction  which some of them regarded as stodgy  adolescent and poorly written  Contents 1 Name 2 History 2 1 Influences and predecessors 2 2 Movement 2 3 Decline and Lasting Influence 3 Authors 4 See also 5 References  edit  Name The term  New Wave  is borrowed from the French film movement known as the nouvelle vague  1  Gary K  Wolfe  professor of humanities and English at Roosevelt University  identifies the introduction of the term New Wave to SF 1  as occurring in 1966 in an essay 2  for the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction written by Judith Merril  who was indirectly yet it seems unambiguously referring to that term in order to comment on the experimental fiction that had begun to appear in the English magazine New Worlds  after Michael Moorcock assumed editorship in 1964  However  Judith Merril denies she ever used that term  3  Merril later popularized this fiction in the United States through her edited anthology England Swings SF  Stories of Speculative Fiction  Doubleday 1968   although an earlier anthology  Harlan Ellison s Dangerous Visions  Doubleday 1967   paved the way for Merril s anthology   edit  History  edit  Influences and predecessors Antecedents to the New Wave in SF are difficult to identify because of the stated aims of its instigators and followers to break completely with the SF of the past  As J  G  Ballard put it    I think science fiction should turn its back on space  on interstellar travel  extra terrestrial life forms  galactic wars and the overlap of these ideas that spreads across the margins of nine tenths of magazine s f  Great writer though he was  I m convinced H  G  Wells has had a disastrous influence on the subsequent course of science fiction   similarly  I think  science fiction must jettison its present narrative forms and plots  4  However  Professor James Gunn in his assessment of the genesis of the 1960s New Wave  takes a broad view and stresses continuity rather than fracture  5  214 Thus he sees 1949 and 1950 as crucial dates in the transition from the kind of consensus definition of SF built up in the 1940s which he characterizes as  imagination leavened with pragmatism   The year 1949 saw the creation by Anthony Boucher and J  Francis McComas of the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction based on the belief that  science fiction could be literate and that a literary approach that included fantasy would be viable on newsstands   In 1950  H  L  Gold produced the magazine Galaxy  Gunn traces the evolution of SF up to this point as follows  The evolution of the science fiction hero began with Mary Shelley s tormented scientist and continued through Poe s natural aristocrat of sensibilities  Verne s middle class engineers  Well s common man  Burrough s adventurers  Gernsback s inventors  Campbell s engineers and meritocrats  and Boucher s man of sensibilities  Now Gold s vision focused not on the adventurer  the inventor  the engineer  or the scientist  but on the average citizen  5  216 Harry Harrison writing the  Introduction  to an anthology of 1950s SF says of the decade  It was an age of experiment  The old barriers were coming down  pulp taboos were being forgotten  new themes and new manners of writing were being explored  Some of the older writers were flexible enough to bend in these new directions   Henry  Kuttner and  Frederik  Pohl are the two represented here  But it was up to the kids to do most of the work   Philip Jose  Farmer startled the world by not only writing but publishing a story   The Lovers  that was all about sex  6  11 Among other authors producing work in the 1950s that broke from the Campbellian concept of SF were Ray Bradbury who achieved a level of general fame that was  unprecedented in the field   7  11 Bradbury was hailed as a visionary by the likes of Christopher Isherwood and C  S  Lewis  Walter M  Miller  Jr  s novel  A Canticle for Leibowitz   1960    also received favorable attention from outside the field as well as within it  7 Theodore Sturgeon   his story When You re Smiling  which appeared in Galaxy in the 1950s  is beautiful and brutal  spiked with psychological understanding   8  90   Fritz Leiber  for example his novel  Gather Darkness    1950  which is  an amusing and ingenious story of superscience disguised as religion and witchcraft  9  88   Algis Budrys  especially for his novel  Rogue Moon  with its use of Freudianism 9  31   and Alfred Bester   singlehandedly it sometimes seems  he invented both New Wave and  cyberpunk    10  206  can be considered as important precursors of the New Wave  Naomi Mitchison s Memoirs of a Spacewoman  1962  has elements that resemble New Wave  though it s not clear if there was any direct influence  citation needed  In his introduction to a reprint of Leigh Brackett s Martian Quest  Michael Moorcock  the editor of New Worlds  and thus the New Wave s prime instigator   wrote  With Catherine Moore  Judith Merril and Cele Goldsmith  Leigh Brackett is one of the true godmothers of the New Wave  Anyone who thinks they re pinching one of my ideas is probably pinching one of hers   Beat writer William S  Burroughs would prove very inspirational  so much so that Philip Jos  Farmer in  The Jungle Rot Kid on the Nod  and Barrington J  Bayley s  The Four Colour Problem   Bayley s most acclaimed work of fiction  which appeared in New Worlds  wrote pastiches of the elder writer s work and J  G  Ballard published an admiring essay in New Worlds  11   Burroughs had earlier expressed admiration for Bayley s short novel Star Virus   Burroughs  use of experimentation such as the cut up technique and his appropriation of science fiction tropes in radical ways proved the extent to which prose fiction could prove revolutionary  In this  the more extreme New Wave writers sought to emulate his example  Brian Aldiss says of this 1950s period  On the whole  the props of SF are few  rocket ships  telepathy  robots  time travel  other dimensions  huge machines  aliens  future wars  Like coins  they become debased by over circulation     in the fifties      writers combined and recombined these standard elements with a truly Byzantine ingenuity     but there were signs even then that limits were being reached  By the sixties  the signs could not be ignored  12  305 306 Ursula K  Le Guin  one of the women writers to emerge in the 1960s  describes the transition to the New Wave era thus  Without in the least dismissing or belittling earlier writers and work  I think it is fair to say that science fiction changed around 1960  and that the change tended toward an increase in the number of writers and readers  the breadth of subject  the depth of treatment  the sophistication of language and technique  and the political and literary consciousness of the writing  The sixties in science fiction were an exciting period for both established and new writers and readers  All the doors seemed to be opening  13  18 This leaves the question as to why  science fiction changed around 1960   why  all the doors seemed to be opening   Rob Latham writing in the New York Review of Science Fiction argues that it is possible to identify three trends that must prevail immediately prior to the advent of any new genre movement  and he illustrates his argument by reference to the 1960s New Wave and the emergence of  cyberpunk  in the 1980s  Thus the three trends common to both the 1960s and 1980s  briefly stated were  1  a widespread sense of malaise among writers and fans owing to economic developments impacting the publication and dissemination of sf  combined with a dawning sense of possibility linked to the arrival of new markets  2  the retirement or obvious decline in productivity of a number of major authors whose output had dominated the previous decade  and 3  the inchoate but growingly palpable influx of fresh thematic material  partly inhibited by prevailing orthodoxies and thus awaiting mobilization by talents less beholden to sf traditions  14  Latham points out that None of these tendencies by itself would be sufficient to explain the emergence of either  1960 s New Wave or 1980 s Cyberpunk  avant garde  but taken together they contributed to a climate that was favorable to calls for a radical refurbishment of sf   edit  Movement It is widely accepted among critics that the New Wave began in England with the SF magazine New Worlds and Michael Moorcock who was appointed editor in 1964  first issue number 142  May and June 15  251  note 1  While the American magazines Amazing Stories  with Cele Goldsmith as editor  and the respected Magazine of Fantasy  amp  Science Fiction had from the very start had a leaning towards unusually literary stories  Moorcock turned that into a concerted policy  No other science fiction magazine sought as consistently to distance itself from traditional science fiction as much as New Worlds  By the time it ceased regular publication it had backed away from the science fiction genre itself  styling itself as an experimental literary journal  Under Moorcock s editorship  galactic wars went out  drugs came in  there were fewer encounters with aliens  more in the bedroom  Experimentation in prose styles became one of the orders of the day  and the baleful influence of William Burroughs often threatened to gain the upper hand   16  27Judith Merril observed that  this magazine  New Worlds  was the publishing thermometer of the trend that was dubbed  the New Wave   In the United States the trend created an intense  incredible controversy  In Britain people either found it of interest or they didn t  but in the States it was heresy on the one hand and wonderful revolution on the other  17  162 163 Merril s  incredible controversy  is characterized by David Hartwell in the opening sentence of a book chapter entitled  New Wave  The Great War of the 1960s  as follows   Conflict and argument are an enduring presence in the SF world  but literary politics has yielded to open warfare on the largest scale only once   18  141 Writing in The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of  science fiction writer Thomas Disch observed that  Literary movements tend to be compounded  in various proportions  of the genius of two or three genuinely original talents  some few other capable or established writers who have been co opted or gone along for the ride  the apprentice work of epigones and wannabes  and a great deal of hype  My sense of the New Wave  with twenty five years of hindsight  is that its irreducible nucleus was the dyad of J  G  Ballard and Michael Moorcock      19  105 It is instructive therefore to read some of what Ballard and Moorcock were writing that engendered such animosity from the established SF community  For example in 1962 Ballard wrote  I ve often wondered why s f shows so little of the experimental enthusiasm which has characterized painting  music and the cinema during the last four or five decades  particularly as these have become wholeheartly speculative  more and more concerned with the creation of new states of mind  constructing fresh symbols and languages where the old cease to be valid    The biggest developments of the immediate future will take place  not on the Moon or Mars  but on Earth  and it is inner space  not outer  that need to be explored  The only truly alien planet is Earth  In the past the scientific bias of s f has been towards the physical sciences   rocketry  electronics  cybernetics   and the emphasis should switch to the biological sciences  Accuracy  that last refuge of the unimaginative  doesn t matter a hoot    It is that inner space suit which is still needed  and it is up to science fiction to build it  20  197 In 1963 Michael Moorcock wrote  Let s have a quick look at what a lot of science fiction lacks  Briefly  these are some of the qualities I miss on the whole   passion  subtlety  irony  original characterization  original and good style  a sense of involvement in human affairs  colour  density  depth  and  on the whole  real feeling from the writer    21  According to David Hartwell 18  146  Algis J  Budrys writing in the review column of Galaxy magazine produced  one of the classic diatribes against Ballard and the new mode of SF then emergent   Hartwell notes the  ringing scorn and righteous indignation  with which Budry s discussion vibrates  A story by J  G  Ballard  as you know  calls for people who don t think  One begins with characters who regard the physical universe as a mysterious and arbitrary place  and who would not dream of trying to understand its actual laws  Furthermore  in order to be the protagonist of a J  G  Ballard novel  or anything more than a very minor character therein  you must have cut yourself off from the entire body of scientific education  In this way  when the world disaster   be it wind or water   comes upon you  you are under absolutely no obligation to do anything about it but sit and worship it  Even more further  some force has acted to remove from the face of the world all people who might impose good sense or rational behavior on you  so that the disaster proceeds unchecked and unopposed except by the almost inevitable thumb rule engineer type who for his individual comfort builds a huge pyramid  without huge footings  to resist high winds  or trains a herd of alligators and renegade divers to help him out in dealing with deep water  22  Roger Luckhurst points out that Ballard s essay  Which Way to Inner Space   20   showed the influence of media theorist Marshall McLuhan and the  anti psychiatry  of R  D  Laing   23  148 Luckhurst traces the influence of both these thinkers in Ballard s fiction  in particular The Atrocity Exhibition  1970  23  152 Another central concern of the New Wave was a fascination with entropy   that the world  and the universe  must tend to disorder  to eventually run down to  heat death   Ballard provided an explicitly cosmological vision of entropic decline of the universe in his magisterial story  The Voices of Time   which appeared in 1960  It provided a matrix of ideas that subsequent New Wave writing teased out in various contexts  Perhaps the best instance of this elaboration was Pamela Zoline s  The Heat Death of the Universe   20  158 Like other writers for New Worlds Zoline uses  science fictional and scientific language and imagery to describe perfectly  ordinary  scenes of life   and by doing so produces  altered perceptions of reality in the reader   24  172 Judith Merill   whose annual anthologies were the first heralds of the coming of the  New Wave  cult   25  105 writing in 1967 in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction contrasts the SF New Wave  which she here terms  The New Thing   in England and the United States  They call it the New Thing  The people who call it that mostly don t like it  and the only general agreements they seem to have are that Ballard is its Demon and I am its prophetess   and that it is what is wrong with Tom Disch  and with British s f in general    The American counterpart is less cohesive as a  school  or  movement   it has had no single publication in which to concentrate its development  and was  in fact  till recently  all but excluded from the regular s f magazines  But for the same reasons  it is more diffuse and perhaps more widespread  26  28 Judith Merril s annual anthologies  1957 1968 27    Damon Knight s Orbit series  and Harlan Ellison s Dangerous Visions featured American writers inspired by British writers  although some of the writers anthologized were British   28  156 Brooks Landon  professor of English at the University of Iowa  says of Dangerous Visions that it was innovative and influential before it had any readers simply because it was the first big original anthology of SF  offering prices to its writers that were competitive with the magazines  The readers soon followed  however  attracted by 33 stories by SF writers both well established and relatively unheard of  These writers responded to editor Harlan Ellison s call for stories that could not be published elsewhere or had never been written in the face of almost certain censorship by SF editors  Among the stories Ellison received were the almost Joycean  Riders of he Purple Wage   by Philip Jose Farmer   Carcinoma Angles   by Norman Spinrad  and  Aye  and Gomorrah    by Samuel R  Delany  as well as stories by Brian Aldiss  Philip K  Dick  J  G  Ballard  John Brunner  John Sladek  Roger Zelazny  David R  Bunch  Theodore Sturgeon  Carol Emshwiller  and Sonya Dorman   T o SF readers  especially in the United States  Dangerous Visions certainly felt like a revolution     Dangerous Visions marks an emblematic turning point for American SF  28  157 The New Wave also had a political subtext  Most of the  classic  writers had begun writing before the Second World War  and were reaching middle age by the early 1960s  the writers of the so called New Wave were mostly born during or after the war  and were not only reacting against the sf writers of the past  but playing their part in the general youth revolution of the 1960s which had such profound effects upon Western culture  It is no accident that the New Wave began in Britain at the time of the Beatles  and took off in the United States at the time of the hippies   both  therefore at a time of cultural innovation and generational shake up   24  167 Eric S  Raymond  looking at the New Wave with an even narrower political focus  observes  The New Wave s inventors  notably Michael Moorcock  J  G  Ballard and Brian Aldiss  were British socialists and Marxists who rejected individualism  linear exposition  happy endings  scientific rigor and the U S  s cultural hegemony over the SF field in one fell swoop  The New Wave s later American exponents were strongly associated with the New Left and opposition to the Vietnam War  leading to some rancorous public disputes in which politics was tangled together with definitional questions about the nature of SF and the direction of the field  29  For example  Judith Merril   one of the most visible    and voluble    apostles of the New Wave in 1960s sf  30  remembers her return from England to the United States  So I went home ardently looking for a revolution  I kept searching until the Chicago Democratic Convention in 1968  I went to Chicago partly to seek out a revolution  if there was one happening  and partly because my seventeen year old daughter   wanted to go  17  167 Merril records later  At the end of the Convention week  the taste of America was sour in all our mouths   17  169 and  by the end of the Sixties  Merril was a political refugee living in Canada   18  142 Roger Luckhurst disagrees with those critics  he gives the example of Thomas Clareson  who perceive the New Wave in terms of rupture  suggesting that such a model doesn t quite seem to map onto the American scene  even though the wider conflicts of the 1960s liberalization in universities  the civil rights movement and the cultural contradictions inherent in consumer society were starker and certainly more violent than in Britain  The young turks within SF also had an ossified  ancient regime  to topple  John Campbell s intolerant right wing editorials for  Astounding Science Fiction   which he renamed  Analog  in 1960  teetered on the self parody  In 1970  when the campus revolt against American involvement in Vietnam reached its height and resulted in the National Guard shooting four students dead in Kent State University  Campbell editorialized that the  punishment was due   and rioters should expect to be met with lethal force  Vietnam famously divided the SF community to the extent that  in 1968   Galaxy  magazine carried two adverts  one signed by writers in favour and one by those against the war  23  160 But caution is needed when assessing any literary movement  for example science fiction writer Bruce Sterling  reacting to his association with another SF movement in the 1980s remarked  When did the New Wave SF end  Who was the last New Wave SF writer  You can t be a New Wave SF writer today  You can recite the numbers of them  Ballard  Ellison  Spinrad  Delaney  blah  blah  blah  What about a transitional figure like Zelazny  A literary movement isn t an army  You don t wear a uniform and swear allegiance  It s just a group of people trying to develop a sensibility  31  Similarly Rob Latham observes      indeed  one of the central ways the New Wave was experienced  in the US and Britain  was as a  liberated  outburst of erotic expression  often counterpoised  by advocates of the  New Thing  as Merril called it   with the priggish Puritanism of the Golden Age  Yet this stark contrast  while not unreasonable  tends ultimately  as do most of the historical distinctions drawn between the New Wave and its predecessors  to overemphasize rupture at the expense of continuity  effectively  disappearing  some of the pioneering trends in 1950s sf that paved the way for the New Wave s innovations  30  252 Bearing this proviso in mind it is still possible to sum up the New Wave in terms of rupture as is done for example by Darren Harris Fain of Shawnee State University  The split between the New Wave and everyone else in American SF during the late 1960s was nearly as dramatic as the division at the same time between young protesters and what they called  the establishment   and in fact  the political views of the younger writers  often prominent in their work  reflect many contemporary concerns  New Wave accused what became de facto the old wave of being old fashioned  patriarchal  imperialistic  and obsessed with technology  many of the more established writers thought the New Wave shallow  said that its literary innovations were not innovations at all  which in fact  outside of SF  they were not   and accused it of betraying SF s grand view of humanity s role in the universe  Both assertions were largely exaggerations  of course  and in the next decade both trends would merge into a synthesis of styles and concerns  However  in 1970 the issue was far from settled and would remain a source of contention for the next few years  7  13 14  edit  Decline and Lasting Influence In the opening paragraph of an essay 32  296 on the New Wave Rob Latham relates that In the August 1970 issue of the SFWA Forum  a publication circulated to members of the Science Fiction Writers of America  Harlan Ellison remarked that the controversy over the New Wave  which had consumed the field during the late 1960s  seemed to have been  blissfully laid to rest   There never was  he claimed  any real conflict among the writers  It was all a manufactured controversy  staged by fans to hype their own participation in the genre  Their total misunderstanding of what was happening  not unusual for fans  as history   shows us  managed to stir up a great deal of pointless animosity and if it had any real effect I suspect it was in the unfortunate area of causing certain writers to feel they were unable to keep up and consequently they slowed their writing output  33  Latham remarks that this analysis by Harlan Ellison  obscures Ellison s own prominent role   and that of other professional authors and editors such as Judith Merril  Michael Moorcock  Lester Del Rey  Frederik Pohl  and Donald A  Wollheim   in fomenting the conflict      32  296 In the early 1970s a number of writers and readers pointed out that winners of the Nebula Awards  created by the Science Fiction Writers of America  SWFA  in 1965  tended to be very different from recipients of the Hugo Awards  given by fans at the annual World Science Fiction Convention  the Worldcon   arguing that this highlighted the fact that many writers had departed from readers  tastes into self indulgence    While some writers and fans continued to argue about the New Wave until the end of the 1970s   in The World of Science Fiction  1926 1976  The History of a Subculture  for instance  Lester Del Ray devotes several pages to castigating the movement   for the most part the controversy died down as the decade wore on  7  20 The closing of New Worlds magazine in 1970  marked the containment of New Wave experiment with the rest of the counter culture  The various limping manifestations of New World across the 1970s   demonstrated the posthumous nature of its avant gardism  23  168 In an essay The Alien Encounter Professor Patrick Parrinder s states that  any meaningful act of defamiliarization can only be relative  since it is not possible for man to imagine what is utterly alien to him  the utterly alien would also be meaningless   34  48 He continues later  Within SF  however  it is not necessary to break with the wider conventions of prose narrative in order to produce work that is validly experimental  The  New Wave  writing of the 1960s  with its fragmented and surrealistic forms  has not made a lasting impact  because it cast its net too wide  To reform SF one must challenge the conventions of the genre on their own terms  34  55 56 Veteran science fiction writer Jack Williamson  1908 2006  when asked in 1991   Did the  New  Wave s emphasis on experimentalizm and its conscious efforts to make SF more  literary  have any kind of permanent effects on the field   replied  After it subsided    it s old hat now    it probably left us with a sharpened awareness of language and a keener interest in literary experiment  It did wash up occasional bits of beauty and power  For example  it helped launch the careers of such writers as  Samuel R  Chip Delany  Brian Aldiss  and Harlan Ellison  all of whom seem to have gone on their own highly individualistic directions  But the key point here is that New Wave SF failed to move people  I m not sure if this failure was due to its pessimistic themes or to people feeling the stuff was too pretentious  But it never really grabbed hold of people s imaginations  35  It has been observed that there is something efficacious in sf s marginality and always tenuous self identity    its ambiguous generic distinction from other literary categories    and  perhaps more importantly  in its distinction from what has variously been called realist  mainstream  or mundane fiction  36  289 David Hartwell s maintains that after the New Wave  science fiction had still managed to retain this  marginality and tenuous self identity   The British and American New Wave in common would have denied the genre status of SF entirely and ended the continual development of new specialized words and phrases common to the body of SF  without which SF would be indistinguishable from mundane fiction in its entirety  rather than only out on the borders of experimental SF  which is properly indistinguishable from any other experimental literature   The denial of special or genre status is ultimately the cause of the failure of the New Wave to achieve popularity  which  if it had become truly dominant  would have destroyed SF as a separate field  18  153 Isaac Asimov  a science fiction writer who began his career with John W  Campbell in Astounding magazine in the 1940s  said of the New Wave   I hope that when the New Wave has deposited its froth and receded  the vast and solid shore of science fiction will appear once more   37  388 Asimov himself was to illustrate just how that  SF shore  did indeed re emerged  vast  solid but changed  A biographer of Asimov noted that during the 1960s stories and novels that Asimov must not have liked and must have felt were not part of the science fiction he had helped to shape were winning acclaim and awards  He also must have felt that science fiction no longer needed him  His science fiction writing    became even more desultory and casual  Asimov s return to serious writing in 1971 with The Gods Themselves  when much of the debate about the New Wave had dissipated  was an act of courage   38  105 Darren Harris Fain observes on this return to writing SF by Asimov that the novel  The Gods Themselves  is noteworthy for how it both shows that Asimov was indeed the same writer in the 1970s that he had been in the 1950s and that he nonetheless had been affected by the New Wave even if he was never part of it  His depiction of an alien m nage a trios  complete with homoerotic scenes between the two males  marks an interesting departure from his earlier fiction  in which sex of any sort is conspicuously absent  Also there is some minor experimentation with structure  7  43 Other themes dealt with in the novel are concerns for the environment and  human stupidity and the delusional belief in human superiority   both frequent topics in New Wave SF  7  44 Commenting in 2002 on the publication of the 35th Anniversary edition of the Dangerous Visions anthology edited by Harlan Ellison  the critic Greg L  Johnson remarked that if the New Wave did not entirely revolutionize the way SF was written   the exploration of an invented world through the use of an adventure plot remains the prototypical SF story outline   they did succeed in pushing the boundaries of what could be considered SF  and their use of stylistic innovations from outside SF helped raise standards  It became less easy for writers to get away with stock characters spouting wooden dialogue laced with technical jargon  Such stories still exist  and are still published  but are no longer typical of the field  39  Isaac Asimov agrees that  on the whole  the New Wave was a good thing   40  137 He describes several  interesting side effects  of the New Wave  Firstly that it brought non American SF to the fore and that afterwards SF was an international phenomenon  Other changes noted were that the New Wave encouraged more and more women to begin reading and writing science fiction   The broadening of science fiction meant that it was approaching the  mainstream    in style and content  It also meant that increasing numbers of mainstream novelists were recognizing the importance of changing technology and the popularity of science fiction  and were incorporating science fiction motifs into their own novels  40  138 139 The noted academic writer on science fiction Edward James sums up the New Wave and its impact as follows  The American New Wave was  on the whole  quite unlike the British  The latter was effectively a group of people associated with a magazine that had a particular programme    whereas even those American writers who gathered in London at the time  like  Samuel R  Delaney   Thomas M  Disch  and  John  Sladek  were individuals pursuing their own ends  not those of Ballard or Moorcock  As a  movement   the American New Wave was even less real than the British  it was no more than a concatenation of talent flourishing at the same time and bringing new ideas and new standards to the writing of sf  The British New Wave had few lasting effects  even in Britain  the American New Wave ushered in a great expansion of the field and of its readership  No doubt the writers did not achieve this success on their own  It may be noted  for instance  that this burst of originality occurred at almost exactly the same times as the three seasons of Star Trek  which certainly contributed to the expansion of sf s readership  Whether or not much of this boom can be attributed to the American New Wave  it is clear that the rise in literary and imaginative standards associated with the late 1960s contributed a great deal to some of the most original writers of the 1970s  including John Crowley  Joe Haldeman  Ursula K  Le Guin  James Tiptree  Jr   and John Varley  24  176 This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Several factors may have contributed to the  death  of New Wave science fiction  One factor was its assimilation into the larger science fiction mainstream  A second factor was the passing of the radicalism of the 1960s in art as well as life  The New Wave s demise may have been hastened by conscious reaction against it in the SF mainstream  Lester del Rey  an influential editor  who had in fact been published in Ellison s first Dangerous Visions anthology   led a conscious effort to re assert genre traditions in the 1970s and early 1980s  Pioneers such as Larry Niven  also published in Dangerous Visions  broke new ground with fresh scientific discoveries and imaginative extrapolations  By then  a neo Campbellian revival of hard science fiction after 1982 at the hands of David Brin  Gregory Benford  Greg Bear and others had emerged  On the other hand  cyberpunk  a movement popularized by Gardner Dozois and editor Ellen Datlow  had made it clear that  the rebellion  had taken on a new form  Some have seen the emergence of cyberpunk literature as a sequel of sorts to the aims of the New Wave movement  Cyberpunk incorporated several of New Wave s  ancestors   namely Burroughs and Alfred Bester and partially embraced New Wave proponents Harlan Ellison and Samuel R  Delany  The New Weird movement and the genre of slipstream fiction occupies a space similar to that of the New Wave movement  in relationship to the mainstream of science fiction and fantasy  However  they have a far less adversial relationship to their  parent  genres  A more important effect of the movement was to broaden the range of acceptable themes and styles in genre SF  While the New Wavers never achieved the thorough disruption of genre conventions they were aiming for  they helped make it possible for post New Wave SF writers to tackle previously taboo subjects and to more often use techniques such as stream of consciousness narration and unreliable narrators  citation

edit  Authors This section requires expansion  John Brunner is noted as a primary exponent of dystopian New Wave science fiction  41  Critic John Clute wrote of M  John Harrison s early writing that
