Catwoman  5  yet Felicia Hardy s signature low cut black costume  cat burglar profession  and steady relationship to Spider Man predate Selina Kyle s similar depiction in comics by almost a decade  Catwoman originally appeared in comics as  the Cat   a maskless pickpocket in a green dress and unrequited love interest for Batman  6  but later became a supervillain who used big cats for elaborate crimes  7  Although she was eventually given a black catsuit and was a romantic interest in the 1966 1968 live action Batman television series  her modern incarnation combining these elements did not occur in comic books until 1987 with Frank Miller s Batman  Year One  8  Wolfman said in an interview   I didn t plan Black Cat to be in Spidey  I created her for Spider Woman  look at the letter column of the first B C  story and you ll see   I then decided to leave Spider Woman and moved her over  So  I never even thought of Catwoman when I did her  I got the idea for her from a Tex Avery cartoon  Bad Luck Blackie   3  Writer director Kevin Smith began writing the Spider Man Black Cat  The Evil that Men Do miniseries in 2002  After the third issue the series went on a hiatus until 2005  when Smith revealed he had finally finished writing the scripts  9  Smith has stated   While I have zero defense for my lateness  particularly when folks like Bendis turn out great stories in multiple books on a monthly basis   I will say this  it s a much better story now than it would ve been had I completed it back in  02   In the mid 2000s  she starred alongside Wolverine in a limited

filaments  which form retractable claws at the fingertips when she flexes her fingers  triggering a magnetic surge which condenses the filaments into polarized talons  which enable her to tear through most surfaces and easily scale walls  In addition  the costume is extremely distracting and provocative  due to its skin tight shape and plunging v neck that exposes her cleavage   which can make it difficult for a male assailant to concentrate on what he is doing  Using this equipment  the Black Cat has been able to beat enemies who have superhuman abilities  The Black Cat has a miniature grappling hook device hidden in the  fur  of each glove  designed by her father Walter Hardy  which enables her to swing from buildings in a manner similar to Spider Man  though not quite as fast  She
