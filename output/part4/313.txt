onto it  and plans to spread hate  Venus pledges herself to him to stop his plans  but Jupiter sees her unselfish act frees her from the pledge and Loki is sent back to the Underworld  He made his first official Marvel appearance in Journey into Mystery  85  October 1962   where Loki was reintroduced by brothers and co writers Stan Lee and Larry Lieber and he was redesigned by Jack Kirby  As one of Thor s arch nemeses  Loki has frequently made appearances in Thor related titles like Journey Into Mystery and Thor  as well as other Marvel Universe titles such as The Avengers  He was the starring character in two four issue miniseries  2004 and 2010   2  3  4  Loki played a key role in the 2010s company wide  Siege  storyline   edit  Fictional character biography After slaying the King of the Frost giants Laufey in battle  Odin found a small Asgardian sized child hidden within the primary stronghold of the Frost Giants  The child was Loki  and Laufey kept him hidden from his people  ashamed of his son s small size  Odin took the boy because he showed strength when Odin slew his father in combat and raised him as his son alongside his biological son Thor  Throughout their childhood and into adolescence  Loki was resentful of the differences in which he and Thor were treated by the citizens of Asgard  The Asgardians valued great strength  tenacity  and bravery in battle above all things  and Loki was clearly inferior to his foster brother Thor in those areas  What he lacked in size and strength  however  he made up for in power and skill  particularly as a sorcerer  As Loki grew to adulthood  his natural talent for causing mischief would make itself manifest and earned him a nickname as the  God of Lies and Mischief   his mischievousness eventually became malice as his hunger for power and revenge grew stronger  Several times he tried to use tricks to get rid of Thor  like telling him to guard a hole in the wall he had made  In time  his reputation grew from being a playful and mischievous trickster to the  God of Evil   Over the centuries  Loki attempted on many occasions to seize rulership of Asgard and to destroy Thor  He even helped the Storm giant Ghan to escape Thor planning to get a debt from him later  and aided other enemies of Asgard  planning to take over  Odin  who had grown weary of Loki s mischief  magically imprisoned him within a tree until someone would shed a tear for him  Loki eventually freed himself by causing a leaf to strike Heimdall  the guardian of Bifrost  in the eye  which made him shed a tear  Loki compiled an extensive criminal record in Asgard  and was frequently exiled  5  He met the Sorceror Eldred  who taught him black magic  He repaid Eldred by later giving him to the Fire demon Surtur   edit  Battles with Earth s heroes Loki s schemes eventually came to include Earth itself  and he often fought with Earth s superhuman heroes to defend their planet and  often  Asgard itself  He first battled Thor on Earth in modern times after escaping from the tree  6  Loki then manipulated the Hulk into wreaking havoc using an illusion of dynamite on train tracks  while in astral form in an attempt to lure Thor to Asgard  which inadvertently led to the formation of the Avengers as several other heroes came to meet the Hulk  7  Thor was one of the founding members of this superhuman team  and often led them in battle against his brother  Several times Loki  while not directly battling Thor himself  caused threats for Thor to battle  like increasing the mental powers of a carnival fortune teller Sandu  making him powerful enough to lift buildings with his mind  8  and releasing a Lava man called Molto by accident when he caused a long dead volcano to explode  9  When Loki convinced Odin to punish Thor  Odin took away half of Thor s power  after which Loki returned the memory of the 23rd century villain Zarkko  Zarkko defeated Thor and took him back to help conquer his time period  although the God of Thunder was able to finally capture the villain  10  Loki even released Mr  Hyde and Cobra by paying their bail  then doubled their powers  Loki told them to kidnap Jane Foster  which he knew would attract Thor s attention  but they were again defeated  volume  amp  issue needed  Among Loki s better known henchmen was the human criminal Carl  The Crusher  Creel  whom Loki transformed into the superhuman criminal known as the Absorbing Man  11  Creel would prove to be a formidable adversary to Thor over the years  Loki went so far as to attempt to turn Odin against Thor and to steal Thor s enchanted hammer  Mjolnir in an attempt to free himself  but all his efforts failed  When he convinced Odin to go to Earth and leave him in charge of Asgard with part of the Odinforce  he released Skagg  the largest Storm Giant  and Surtur  the huge Fire Demon  to try to destroy Odin  However Thor and Balder helped defeat the monsters  and Loki was sent to serve the Trolls  Loki was responsible for the Destroyer being awakened  by leading a Hunter to the Temple where the Destroyer armor resided using his mental abilities while Thor was nearby  causing the Hunter s soul to animate the armor  but Thor forced the Hunter to return to his body  then buried the armor under thousands of tons of rock  12  The Absorbing Man was brought back to Earth by Loki  and battled Thor  but Loki quickly took him to Asgard when Thor was on the verge of defeating him  The Absorbing Man defeated the Asgardians without too much trouble and absorbed Odin s attacks  However Loki and his ally were exiled into space due to a trick by Odin  13  He sent his astral form back to Earth and took over the Destroyer armor  attempting to take over Asgard  but Odin sent Balder to discover the location of Loki  then used his powers to send Loki out of the Destroyer armor  14   edit  Taking over Asgard Loki s destiny to be the cause of Ragnarok was later recounted  15  Loki returned from his exile in space  but was then stripped of his powers and exiled to Earth by Odin  Loki plotted to gain new powers from Karnilla  however  this accidentally created the Wrecker  who gained Asgardian powers when he was mistaken for Loki after knocking him out and putting on his helmet just before Karnilla appeared in response to Loki s ritual  He almost killed Thor by collapsing a building on him  as Thor had been stripped of all his powers except his strength by Odin  Loki then fomented a battle between Thor and the Destroyer animated by Sif  16  Loki then took command of Asgard during the Odinsleep  using his right as the  son  of Odin before Thor could claim it  but fled when Asgard was invaded by Mangog as he realized that this new foe was too powerful  17  Loki later usurped the throne of Asgard by taking the Odinring  but fled again when Asgard was invaded by Surtur  18  Much later  Loki usurped the throne of Asgard again  and set the Destroyer against Thor once more  19  Shortly after that  Loki caused the temporary death of Balder using mistletoe  as he had conspired with Hela to cause Ragnarok if his last plan failed  At this time  Loki s estranged wife Sigyn returned to Asgard  When Loki was chained and a viper dripped poison onto his face as punishment for killing Balder  Sigyn tried helping him  Loki attempted to bring about Ragnarok  but was foiled by Odin  20  Alongside Tyr and his forces  Loki stole the golden apples of Idunna and invaded Asgard with help from the Midgard serpent  but then changed sides and aided Odin s forces in defeating Tyr  21  Despite Loki s hatred of his foster brother and father  Loki helped to defend Asgard from destruction from Surtur and his fire demons  This was because Surtur s goal was to destroy Asgard  whereas Loki sought only to rule it  Alongside Odin and Thor  Loki battled Surtur  and witnessed the seeming demise of Odin  22  Not long after that  Loki transformed Thor into a frog for a time  using the Twilight Sword  Thor was turned back when Volstagg destroyed one of the machines Loki had used to transform Thor  23  He then involved the X Men and Alpha Flight in a plot to gain favor with  Those Who Sit Above in Shadow  by trying to prove that he could do a truly good deed by offering to grant the wishes of the two teams   such as giving Puck a normal body while granting Rogue the ability to touch again   but he failed the test because he tried to force the gifts on the heroes after they rejected them  the two teams learning that these enhanced powers   and the further powers that Loki would grant to the world   would deprive those who received the gifts of the ability to imagine and create new things  essentially destroying what it meant to be human  24   edit   Acts of Vengeance  In disguise  Loki manipulated a group of master villains into engineering the  Acts of Vengeance   With these prime movers  he set in motion a plot against the Avengers and other heroes  He sent the Juggernaut against Thor  and cast a spell that caused temporary bouts of weakness in Thor  He battled the combined forces of the West Coast and East Coast Avengers  His identity was ultimately revealed  and he was defeated by the Avengers  25  26  27  Loki would actually die at the hands of Thor  28  although  manipulation of the time stream would later bring him back  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Debt to Spider Man Through a time traveling adventure with Doctor Strange  Morwen  a foe of Strange s former master  is released  taking Tessa Black  a child of Loki  as a host  With Strange unavailable  she is detected and confronted by both Loki and Spider Man  Spider Man having played a part in the crisis that resulted in her escape   When Spider Man saves Tessa by distracting Morwen long enough for Loki to make contact with her  Loki proclaims he owes one debt to the wallcrawler  29   edit  Ragnar k It was prophesied Loki would lead Asgard s enemies into the  Eternal Realm  and aid them in destroying it in a final conflict known as Ragnar k  sometimes referred to as  The Twilight of the Gods   Loki fulfilled the prophecy by forging Uru weapons for his army after he found the forge used to create Thor s hammer  Mjolnir  Not even Thor s hammer could break the shields and it was shattered in a nuclear scale explosion  This battle consumed all who participated in it and it was revealed that the continuing Asgardian cycle of the birth  life  and death was presided over by beings known as  Those Who Sit Above in Shadow  who drew sustenance from the energies expended during these cycles  In the final confrontation between Loki and Thor prior to the final battle that would bring Ragnar k to a close  Thor declared Loki to be less than those he vanquished  His punishment was to strip Loki of a body to make his body match his stature  Thor then hung Loki s head from his belt so he could watch the final moments of the end of days  All Asgardians perished in this last Ragnarok except for Thor  who would disappear into a deep sleep  This time   Those Who Sit Above  followed the Asgardians in death and were unable to revive them  30  Upon Thor s return  it was revealed the Asgardians existed on Earth in mortal guises  31   edit  Return Loki s female form  Art by Olivier Coipel  After the Ragnarok  Loki returned in a new female form and was revealed to have been working with Doctor Doom  plotting to manipulate events so Thor unwittingly resurrected his greatest Asgardian enemies  32  After Loki s resurrection  she claimed to make a new vow  to never lie again  However  she manipulated Balder to make him a new successor to the throne of Asgard  and potentially start a civil war against Thor  33  It was revealed that Loki retained his male form after Ragnarok but hid himself inside a female body  which originally belonged to Thor s reborn lover Sif  in order to sell to Thor the idea that he wished to change  Combining his magic with that of Hela  Loki traveled to the past and set into motion the events that led to his younger self being adopted by Odin  starting by turning Bor into snow  His reasons for doing this were later revealed as a means to eliminate Bor  Thor s grandfather  34   edit   Secret Invasion  In  Secret Invasion  storyline  Loki was with the Asgardians when she goaded them into believing the injured Beta Ray Bill was a Skrull  resulting in a mob of Asgardians nearly attacking him  although Thor used his hammer to stop the rumor by showing Bill could lift it  35   edit  Dark Reign Following the Skrulls defeat  Loki was introduced as a member of the Cabal  consisting of herself  Norman Osborn  Emma Frost  Doctor Doom  Namor  and the Hood  36  Osborn gathered them to obtain their support for his plans for his  new world order   Osborn offered the Cabal solidarity and the resources to accomplish their own agendas  In return Osborn asked for their public support registration  as well as cooperation in fulfilling any request he may have of them  When asked what she wanted  Loki responded she wanted Asgard and wanted it back in the heavens where it belonged  37  In Thor  600  it was revealed Loki traveled to the past to ensure Bor  father of Odin and first king of Asgard  perished in battle against the Frost Giants  He turned the Asgardian king to snow after luring them to him with a Frost Giant  In the present day  Loki revived Bor from some snow in New York City  but placed a spell on him to mistake everything around him as an enemy  causing him to attack everything in sight  He was further aggrieved by the belief that his son s failure to resurrect him could only mean he was killed in battle  Thor arrived on the scene but Loki s enchantment caused Bor to see Thor as a monster  Sensing Odin s power inside what he saw as a demon  Bor attacked Thor  attempting to avenge his son  While Thor and Bor fought  Loki made Balder aware of Bor s identity and the two rushed to New York to stop Thor from killing him  Thor never met Bor until now and was unaware of his identity   Thor was forced to kill Bor fearing the entire planet would be destroyed in the wake of their battle  due to Bor s vast power  In the aftermath of the battle  Loki reminded Balder that the resurrected Bor was technically the king of Asgard when Thor killed him and the punishment for killing the king was banishment from Asgard  Balder was forced to agree  After Thor s banishment  Loki made arrangements to have all Asgardians  but not Asgard itself  moved to Latveria at the invitation of Doctor Doom  38  Loki  along with Balder  attended a dinner hosted by Doctor Doom to secure a new home for the Asgardians in Latveria  She was caught off guard by Balder s insistence that since they are leaving Asgard  Thor should be allowed to rejoin them  Loki was able to calm Balder before he offended Doom too much  She later appeared before Blake and Thor to tell them that she would be returning to her male form shortly and that he had come to the realization that his body was meant for Sif  Loki explained that  after Ragnarok  when the Asgardians were being placed into human hosts  Sif s soul was placed into a dying human  When Thor sent out the call for the Asgardians to return  Sif s host was too weak to hear the call  When Thor mass summoned the Asgardians  Sif s body was created but her soul could not be placed into it  Sif s body went looking for a soul with no body and found Loki  Loki told them that the transfer from his female form to his male form would probably kill Sif s host and she urged Blake and Thor to find Sif and say goodbye  39  By the time Thor restored Sif  Loki was back in his male form  40  Following the Hood s depowerment at the hands of Doctor Strange  Brother Voodoo  and the Son of Satan  Loki offered the Hood a second chance  41   edit  Mighty Avengers The Scarlet Witch appeared in her astral form recruiting a team of Avengers to face the Elder God Chthon  42  It was soon revealed that Wanda was Loki in disguise  The Avengers  unaware of Loki s trick  followed the false  Wanda s  instructions  43  Her goal was to throw Norman Osborn off balance  as shown during the second meeting of the Cabal  After Thor was banished due to her trickery  Loki intended to put  cracks in Osborn s armor  and gradually  widen  these cracks through the Mighty Avengers  Pietro Maximoff  desiring to see and converse with his sister  joined the Mighty Avengers  He raced around the world searching for her  not knowing that his nephews Billy and Tommy had just done so and also failed to find her  44  However  Loki had planned on the deaths of Pietro and Cassandra Lang  fearing they may be wedges in her plans  She cut off communications from the former  and tried to convince Hank Pym to expel Cassie after placing a spell on her to prevent her from saying anything bad about her disguise  The latter  however  invited her fellow Young Avengers into the Infinite Avengers Mansion  an extension of the PymPocket   to prove that the Scarlet Witch was evil  When Wiccan cast a spell to bring Scarlet Witch to them  Loki appeared as Scarlet Witch and stated that Cassandra Lang sealed their fate  Just then  Ronin appeared and ambushed the  Scarlet Witch   45  He determined that she was not Wanda by kissing her and stating that the real Scarlet Witch would have used her power to revive Cassandra s father  Wiccan then chanted a spell to reveal her true form  Afraid of exposure  Loki was forced to leave swearing all their deaths  46  The continued achievements of the Mighty Avengers strained Osborn to the breaking point  Loki decided to play the final card that would break Osborn by unleashing the Absorbing Man  who had absorbed the power of the Cosmic Cube  47  In the Dark Avengers  Loki was in Norman Osborn s office and manipulated him into becoming the Green Goblin again  as Siege begins  48   edit  Siege Main article  Siege  comics  Loki was present at the Cabal when Norman Osborn denied to bring Namor to Doctor Doom  When the Doombot posing as Doctor Doom unleashed insect like robots  Loki advised to the Hood to take flight  Following Osborn s talk with the President  Loki advised to recreate an incident similar to the Stamford Incident that would bring about the invasion upon Asgard  49  50  He then revealed a plot to Osborn that would take advantage of Volstagg s presence in Chicago  Since Volstagg had gone for adventures like Thor  the U Foes could attack him and destroy a packed Soldier Field during an American football game killing thousands while he and Osborn watch in astral form  Loki then warned Balder about Obsorn s impending attack on Asgard and claimed he tried to convince Osborn not to attack  51  52  He killed an Asgardian who prophesied the attack and sends Heimdall s chamber beneath Asgard clarification needed  so he couldn t warn the Asgardians in time  Loki  when Osborn called out to him for their aid  sent the Hood and his syndicate as reinforcements to help Osborn s forces against the Avengers  53  54  Loki later appeared to Balder  telling him that he would have simply pardoned Thor instead of banishing him if he had not wanted the throne of Asgard for himself  Balder later banished Loki from Asgard  55  Some time after he magically disguised himself as Osborn s Green Goblin persona to lay siege to Asgard  Loki encountered the Disir  the Valkyries of Bor  after he lured them using several wandering god s souls he imprisoned as bait  revealing that he desired to gain their service as his slaves  The 13 Disir unite and assault him as one  but Loki managed to defeat them using extraordinary swordsmanship skills  thus forcing them to submit to him and declare him the victor  Loki meets with Hela and asks her what she will give in exchange for a new Hel  to which she answers  Anything   He meets with Mephisto  demonstrating the power of the Disir and agreeing to lend him the Disir for a hundred and one days in exchange for the demon lord granting a portion of his netherworld to his daughter Hela for one thousand and one years  as her new  Hel   which Mephisto agrees to  In exchange for this  Hela erased Loki from the Books of Hel  thus he was no longer tied to Hel or Asgard  gaining absolute freedom  Mephisto asked Loki why he had resorted to such schemes  to which Loki replied it was more fun this way  56  57  When the combined forces of the New Avengers  Young Avengers and the Secret Warriors defeated the Dark Avengers  Thor demanded to know where Loki was  Norman Osborn could only tell him that he was dead  just like the rest of them as the true form of the Void appeared  53  54  As the creature tore apart the three teams  Loki began to repent  realizing that what had happened to Asgard was not what he wanted  He begged his father  Odin  to return to him the Norn Stones  which were taken away from the Hood and given to the trickster  He used their power to empower the three teams and give the powers of the Hood s gang to them and fight back against the Void  However  the Void sensed Loki s hand in this and attacked him  the stones not affecting him directly  As Loki was torn apart by the Void s tendrils in front of a shocked Thor  his last words were to apologize to his brother  Thor resolved to avenge his fallen brother and destroyed the Void and the Sentry with a lightning strike  He took the Sentry s remains into outer space  and released them into the Sun  58  59   edit  Reincarnation

restoration of Loki s memory  but not of his past life with the exception of a guilty conscience for things he cannot remember  With nothing to lose  Loki followed Thor  who restored part of his identity to him  though he remains in the form of a child   and asked when did Thor get so old  to which Thor smiled  60  Thor took Loki to the remains of Asgard where plans were made to help the refugees of the World Tree  61  With the resurrection of Odin  Loki was frightened away and fled with Thor who lambasted Odin for scaring him away  Running into Iron Man  Loki was saved by Thor who defended his own reasons for bringing the trickster back  62   edit  Journey Into Mystery With the Asgardian population other than Thor still wary of Loki  Loki revealed to his brother that he was attempting to learn more about Earth and humans  to which Thor approves  When a magpie exploded in his quarters carrying a key  it led to a chain of events where at the end  Loki was contacted by an echo of his former incarnation  who revealed he chose to sacrifice himself fighting the Void as part of a greater plan which would involve his death and return  The child Loki refused to follow this path  wanting to be his own person  and transformed the spirit of his former self into a magpie named Ikol  On returning to Earth  he witnessed Odin striking down Thor  63  Odin prepared all of Asgard for an unknown battle and imprisoned Thor for attempting to protect Midgard from being scoured  Loki  who disagreed with Odin s actions  was put to work by Volstagg into cleaning the stables of Thor s goats to keep him out of trouble and danger  Using the wool of one of the goats  Loki descended into the roots of the World Tree at the advice of Ikol to ask questions from the Nornish women who live there  After receiving his answers  Loki wept but decided to turn to the imprisoned Thor for his opinion before making his final decision  Breaking into the prison by stealth  Loki asked his brother what he would do if he had to let something bad happen in order to prevent something worse from happening and what if it cost him everything  With Thor s answer  Loki decided to free one of the imprisoned Hel Wolves and bind it to him in servitude using the bridle of Thor s goats  He revealed he needed help from one more  personage  before heading for the realm of Hela  64  Having recovered

t resist the opportunity to mess that up   80  However  he is hesitant to use his abilities overtly as he claims Odin will then be able to find him  Yet once all The Liberators are defeated  he decides to do things himself  After revealing to the Ultimates who he is  he rises into the air and changes the color of the sky  At that moment   thanks to the Scarlet Witch  calculating the odds  of someone showing up to defeat him   the sky opens and Thor  his brother  appears for revenge  81  Issue 13 shows further demonstrations of his power by attempting to trap Thor in an illusion and withstanding a direct blow from Thor s hammer uninjured  claiming it cannot hurt him  During this battle  Thor mentions that Loki s powers have weakened for an unexplained reason  After Loki summons an army of monsters to battle the Ultimates and nearly kills Thor  the thunder god then proceeds to summon allies from Asgard while he strikes Loki with his hammer  sending him back to Asgard where Odin awaits him  82  Loki s motivation for his actions is not completely revealed  He mentions several motivations from a desire to cause World War III to Odin favoring Thor over him and attempting to gain Odin s favor  83  Throughout the whole ordeal Loki regards humans as mere playthings for his pranks  In addition to creating a Norwegian super soldier program that was supposedly part of an EU initiative and making people believe it was real  even though Norway is not part of the European Union  he claimed to have been the one who framed Captain America for treason  regarding the failure of humans to realize the problems with these assertions as humorous  84  Loki from his  punishment  in New Ultimates  85  playing an integral part in the re apperence of the Defenders  now super powered  as well the invasion of Asgardians to New York with the help of Amora the Enchantress  86  He is later revealed to be the one behind Valkyrie s powers manifesting after the invasion forces attacked
