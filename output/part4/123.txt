most European languages  is a descendant of the ancient Proto Indo European language  It originated in the Italian peninsula  Although it is considered a dead language  a number of scholars and members of the Christian clergy speak it fluently  and many schools and universities continue to teach it  4  Latin is still used in the creation of new words in modern languages of many different families  including English  Latin and its daughter Romance languages are the only surviving branch of the Italic language family  Other branches of the Italic languages are attested in documents surviving from early Italy  but were assimilated during the Roman Republic  The extensive use of elements from vernacular speech by the earliest authors and inscriptions of the Roman Republic make it clear that the original  unwritten language of the Roman Monarchy was an only partially deducible colloquial form  the predecessor to Vulgar Latin  By the late Roman Republic  a standard  literate form had arisen from the speech of the educated  now referred to as Classical Latin  Vulgar Latin  by contrast  is the name given to the more rapidly changing colloquial language spoken throughout the empire  5  With the Roman conquest  Latin spread to many Mediterranean regions  and the dialects spoken in these areas  mixed to various degrees with the autochthonous languages  developed into the Romance tongues  including Aragonese  Catalan  Corsican  French  Galician  Italian  Occitan  Portuguese  Romanian  Romansh  Sardinian  Sicilian  and Spanish  6  Classical Latin slowly changed with the Decline of the Roman Empire  as education and wealth became ever scarcer  The consequent Medieval Latin  influenced by various Germanic and proto Romance languages until expurgated by Renaissance scholars  was used as the language of international communication  scholarship and science until well into the 18th century  when it began to be supplanted by vernacular languages  Latin is a highly inflected language  with three distinct genders  seven noun cases  four verb conjugations  six tenses  three persons  three moods  two voices  two aspects and two numbers  A dual number is present in Archaic Latin  One of the rarer of the seven cases is the locative  only used with nouns that signify a location  The vocative  used in direct discourse  is identical to the nominative except for words of the second declension  Though various authors have proposed differing totals  there are only five fully productive cases  Adjectives and adverbs are compared  and the former are inflected according to case  gender  and number  Although Classical Latin has demonstrative pronouns indicating varying degree of proximity  it doesn t have articles  Later Romance language articles developed from the demonstrative pronouns  e g   le and la from ille and illa  In terms of vocabulary  however  Latin tends to preserve the original forms of many Indo European roots  Compared to other Indo European languages of antiquity  such as Sanskrit and Ancient Greek  the word forms in the Classical era are far more reflective of their etyma  citation needed  Languages such as Sanskrit  however  tend to be more conservative with regards to grammar  citation needed  Contents 1 Legacy 1 1 Inscriptions 1 2 Literature 1 3 Influence on English 1 4 Classical education 1 4 1 Formal support for the

been published in an internationally agreed upon  monumental  multi volume series termed the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum  CIL   Authors and publishers vary but the format is approximately the same  volumes detailing inscriptions with a critical apparatus stating the provenance and relevant information  The reading and interpretation of these inscriptions is the subject matter of the field of epigraphy  There are approximately 270 000 known inscriptions   edit  Literature The works of several hundred ancient authors who wrote in Latin have survived in whole or in part  in substantial works or in fragments to be analyzed in philology  They are in part the subject matter of the field of classics  Their works were published in manuscript form before the invention of printing and now exist in carefully annotated printed editions such as the Loeb Classical Library by Harvard University Press or the Oxford Classical Texts by Oxford University Press   edit  Influence on English Main article  Latin influence in English In the medieval period  much borrowing from Latin occurred through ecclesiastical usage established by Saint Augustine of Canterbury in the 6th century  or indirectly after the Norman Conquest through the Anglo Norman language  From the 16th to the 18th centuries  English writers cobbled together huge numbers of new words from Latin and Greek words  These were dubbed  inkhorn terms   as if they had spilled from a pot of ink  Many of these words were used once by the author and then forgotten  but some which proved useful survived  such as imbibe and extrapolate  Many of the most common polysyllabic English words are of Latin origin  through the medium of Old French   edit  Classical education Main article  Instruction in Latin A multi volume Latin dictionary in the University Library of Graz Throughout European history  an education in the Classics was considered a must for those who wished to join literate circles  In today s world  a large number of Latin students in America learn from Wheelock s Latin  The Classic Introductory Latin Course  Based on Ancient Authors  This book  first published in 1956  7  was written by Frederic M  Wheelock  who received a PhD from Harvard University  Wheelock s Latin has become the standard text for many American introductory Latin courses   edit  Formal support for the study of Latin The Living Latin movement attempts to teach Latin in the same way that living languages are taught  i e   as a means of both spoken and written communication  It is available at the Vatican  and at some institutions in the U S   such as the University of Kentucky and Iowa State University  The British Cambridge University Press is a major supplier of Latin textbooks for all levels  such as the Cambridge Latin Course series  It has also published a subseries of children s texts in Latin by Bell  amp  Forte  which recount the adventures of a mouse called Minimus  In the United Kingdom  the Classical Association encourages the study of antiquity through various means  such as publications and grants  In the United States and Canada  the American Classical League supports every effort to further the study of classics  Its subsidiaries include  the National Junior Classical League  with more than 50 000 members   which encourages high school students to pursue the study of Latin  and the National Senior Classical League  which encourages students to continue their study of the classics into college  The league also sponsors the National Latin Exam  Classicist Mary Beard wrote in The Times Literary Supplement in 2006 that the reason for learning Latin is because of what was written in it  8  Latin is taught as a mandatory subject in gymnasia and other so called classical high schools  located chiefly in Europe  In the United States  although once offered nearly universally  Latin is limited to elective status in a steadily declining number of grade schools  both public and private  The ordinary student can no longer count on being able to take Latin  but there are  however  extracurricular means  The College Board examinations  which serve as an educational tool for the admission of students into colleges  still features one Latin examination on a voluntary basis  Advanced Placement Latin  Vergil   edit  Latin translations of modern literature Latin translations of modern literature such as Treasure Island  Robinson Crusoe  Paddington Bear  Winnie the Pooh  Tintin  Asterix  Harry Potter  Walter the Farting Dog  Le Petit Prince  Max und Moritz  How the Grinch Stole Christmas  and The Cat in the Hat and a book of fairy tales   fabulae mirabiles   are intended to garner popular interest in the language  Additional resources include phrasebooks and resources for rendering everyday phrases and concepts into Latin  such as Meissner s Latin Phrasebook   edit  Constructed languages based on Latin Many international auxiliary languages have been heavily influenced by Latin  Interlingua  which lays claim to a sizeable following  is sometimes considered a simplified  modern version of the language  Latino sine Flexione  popular in the early 20th century  is Latin with its inflections stripped away  among other grammatical changes   edit  History Main article  History of Latin Latin has been divided into historical phases  each of which is distinguished by subtle differences in vocabulary  usage  spelling  morphology and syntax  In addition to the historical phases  Ecclesiastical Latin refers to the styles used by the writers of the Roman Catholic Church  as well as Protestant scholars  from Late Antiquity onward  It is also the longest living language to date   edit  Archaic Latin Main article  Archaic Latin The earliest known form is Archaic Latin  which was spoken from ancient times up to the middle Republican period  and attested in several inscriptions  as well as some of the earliest extant literary works  During this period  the Latin alphabet was first introduced by Rome s Etruscan rulers  The writing style later changed from an initial right to left or boustrophedon 9  to a left to right script  10  Archaic Latin is attested through thousands of inscriptions from the Roman Republic  and through the writings of early authors such as Plautus  whose comedies are the earliest substantial works written in Latin   edit  Classical Latin Main article  Classical Latin During the late republic and into the first years of the empire  a new Classical Latin arose  a conscious creation of the orators  poets  historians and other literate men  who wrote the great works of classical literature  which were taught in grammar and rhetoric schools  Today s instructional grammars trace their roots to these schools  which served as a sort of informal language academy dedicated to maintaining and perpetuating educated speech  11  12   edit  Vulgar Latin Main article  Vulgar Latin Philological analysis of Archaic Latin works  such as Plautus   which contain snippets of everyday speech  indicates that a spoken language  which has from ancient times been called Vulgar Latin  sermo vulgi by Cicero   the language of the vulgus or  commoners   existed alongside the literate Classical Latin  Since this language  by virtue of its informality  was rarely written  philologists have been left with individual words and phrases cited by Classical authors  as well as those found as graffiti  13  As vernacular Latin was free to develop on its own  there is no reason to expect that the speech was uniform either diachronically or geographically  Just the opposite must have been true  as Romanized European populations developed their own dialects of the language  14  This is the situation that prevailed when the Migration Period  ca  300 700 AD  brought an end to the unity of the Roman world and removed the stabilizing influence of its institutions upon the language  A post classical phase of Latin appeared  Late Latin  which was far more influenced by the everyday parlance  One of the tests as to whether a given Latin feature or usage was in the spoken language is to compare its reflex in a Romance language with the equivalent formation in classical Latin  If it appeared in the Romance language but was not preferred in classical Latin  then it is most likely vulgar Latin  For example  the noun case system is present in classical Latin  but not in the Romance languages  apart from remnants in Romanian  One might conclude that case endings throughout most of the Roman world started fading some time after the abandonment of Dacia in AD 271  even while their use continued in literate circles  In addition  much Romance vocabulary arose in vulgar Latin  rather than classical  The following examples adhere to this formula  classical Latin vulgar Latin Italian French Spanish Portuguese  ignis focus fuoco feu fuego fogo  equus caballus cavallo cheval caballo cavalo  loqui parabolare parlare parler hablar falar  from fabulari   15  In each case  Italian  French  Spanish and Portuguese use terms that are derived from vulgar Latin  although classical equa gave rise to Spanish yegua and Portuguese  gua  all meaning  mare    Thus  we can deduce the everyday vocabulary of late Roman times  The expansion of the Roman Empire spread Latin throughout Europe and North Africa  Vulgar Latin already began to diverge into distinct languages by the 9th century at the very latest  when the earliest extant Romance writings begin to appear  They were  throughout the Dark Ages  confined to everyday speech  as medieval Latin was used for writing   edit  Medieval Latin Main article  Medieval Latin The language of Rome has had a profound impact on later cultures  as demonstrated by this Latin Bible from 1407 The term Medieval Latin refers to the written Latin in use during that portion of the post classical period when no corresponding Latin vernacular existed  The spoken language had developed into the various incipient Romance Languages  however  in the educated and official world Latin continued without its natural spoken base  Moreover  this Latin spread into lands that had never spoken Latin  such as the Germanic and Slavic nations  It became useful as a means of international communication between the member states of the Holy Roman Empire and its allies  Cut loose from its corrective spoken base and severed from the vanished institutions of the Roman empire that had supported its uniformity  medieval Latin lost its linguistic cohesion  for example  suus   his her own    sui   his her own   and eius   his her   are used almost interchangeably  a confusion not resolved until the Renaissance  in works such as the tract of Lorenzo Valla  De reciprocatione suus et sui  In classical Latin sum and eram are used as auxiliary verbs in the perfect and pluperfect passive  which are compound tenses  Medieval Latin might use fui and fueram instead  16  Furthermore the meanings of many words have been changed and new vocabulary has been introduced from the vernacular  While these minor changes are not enough to impair comprehension of the language  they introduce a certain flexibility not in it previously  The style of each individual author is characterized by his own uses of classically incorrect Latin to such a degree that one can identify him just by reading his Latin  In that sense medieval Latin is a collection of individual idioms united loosely by the main structures of the language  Some are more classical  others less so  16  The majority of these writers were influential members of the Christian church  bishops  monks  philosophers  etc   however  the term  Ecclesiastical Latin  does not accurately apply  There was no uniform language of the church  Late Latin is sometimes classified as medieval  sometimes not  Certainly many of the individual Latins were influenced by the vernaculars of their authors   edit  Renaissance Latin Main article  Renaissance Latin The bulk of 15th century printed books  incunabula  was in Latin  with the vernacular languages playing only a secondary role  17  The Renaissance briefly reinforced the position of Latin as a spoken language  through its adoption by the Renaissance Humanists  Often led by members of the clergy  they were shocked by the accelerated dismantling of the vestiges of the classical world and the rapid loss of its literature  They strove to preserve what they could  It was they who introduced the practice of producing revised editions of the literary works that remained by comparing surviving manuscripts  and they who attempted to restore Latin to what it had been  They corrected medieval Latin out of existence no later than the 15th century and replaced it with more formally correct versions supported by the scholars of the rising universities  who attempted  through scholarship  to discover what the classical language had been   edit  Phonology Main article  Latin spelling and pronunciation This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   August 2011  Pronunciation of Latin by the Romans in ancient times has been reconstructed from a variety of data  such as the evolution of features of the Romance languages  the representation of Latin words in other languages  such as Greek  the metrical patterns of Latin poetry  and more  18  This reconstruction is known as  pronuntiatio  restituta  restored pronunciation  among Latin speakers of today and widely adopted for reasons of perceptibility  The table below lists the consonant phonemes of Classical Latin  1st century BC  beginning 1st century AD    Labial Dental Palatal Velar Glottal plain labial Plosive voiced b d     voiceless p t   k k  aspirated p  t    k  Fricative voiced   z voiceless f s h Nasal m n       Rhotic r       Approximant   l j w Latin spelling of the Classical period seems to have been largely phonemic  with each letter corresponding to a specific phoneme in the language  save for some exceptions  In particular  all vowels varied in pronunciation depending upon their vowel length  the letter  n  represented either a dental nasal  a velar nasal  or lengthening and nasalization of the preceding vowel if an  f  or  s  follows  and the letters  i  and  u  represented either consonants or vowels depending on context  Although Classical Latin did not have a distinction between either i and j or u or v  in later publications  i and u can represent solely the vowel form while j and v solely the consonant form  Most of the letters are  after this reconstruction  pronounced the same as in English  but note the following  Consonants   c     k   never as in nice  without aspiration  as in Italian peccare   g         never as in germ   i  or  j   consonantal  i      j   like English y in you  The  i  is pronounced as a glide if in the beginning of a root before a vowel or between two vowels  e g  iucundus    ju  k nd s    pleasant    periucundus    p  ju  k nd s    very pleasant     l  existed in two different allophonic variants  l exilis before  l  and  i   and l pinguis in all other positions  The precise phonetic nature of these two allophones is unknown  so they are represented by a single consonant in the table above   n     n  or     If  n  occurs before  c    g  or  x  or directly after a  g   19  it is pronounced       ng  as in  sing    Otherwise  it is pronounced  n  20  or before  f  and  s  represents a nasalization prolongation of the preceding vowel  e g   consul      k  s l     ph     p    pronounced approximately like p in English point  just with more aspiration  never as in English philosopher   qu  or  qv     k    r  if beginning a syllable        as in Spanish pero    r  if finishing a syllable and  rr     r   as in Spanish perro   t     t   never as in English nation or American English better  without aspiration  as in Spanish tentar   th     t    analogous to ph  never as in English thunder or the   u  or  v   consonantal  u      w  The u is pronounced as a consonant also if beginning a root and before a vowel or if placed between two vowels  e g  uehebantur    w he  bant      they were driving    inuehebantur    inw he  bant      they were attacking verbally    amauere    ama  we        x     ks  Long consonants are represented by doubled spelling  puella    p   l a    girl   similar to Italian nella   littera     l t   a    letter    character   as in Italian petto   accidere    ak  d       to happen   stress on the second syllable  as in Italian ecco   addere     ad        to add    pessime     p s ime     very most badly   and the like  It is also notable that consonants at the end of syllables close these syllables clearly  that means the latter are pronounced longer  e g  amare    a ma       to love   has the quantitative structure short long short  whereas armare    ar ma       to arm   shows long long short  This feature of classical Latin is crucial to the understanding and retracing of Latin poetical rhythms of classical and ensuing times  which are mainly based on syllable lengths  less on the word stresses  Vowels   a     a  when short and  a   when long   e         as in pet  when short and  e    somewhat as in English they  when long   i         as in pin  when short and  i    as in machine  when long  o         as in British English law  when short and  o    somewhat as in holy  when long   u         as in put  when short and  u    as in true  when long  Classical Latin distinguished between long and short vowels  and the use of the apex  which indicates long vowels  was quite widespread during classical and postclassical times  In modern texts  long vowels are often indicated by a macron                  and short vowels are sometimes indicated by a breve                  The vowel length distinction began to fade by Late Latin  A vowel followed by an  m  or  n   maintained later by some Romance languages   either at the end of a word   m  only  or before another consonant  is nasal  as in monstrum  m  str    and in many cases the consonant is not pronounced  as in French and Portuguese  19   edit  Orthography Main article  Latin alphabet The Duenos Inscription  from the 6th century BC  is one of the earliest known Old Latin texts  Latin was written using the Latin Alphabet  derived from the Old Italic alphabet  in turn drawn from the Greek and ultimately the Phoenician alphabet  21  This alphabet has continued to be used throughout centuries as the script for the Romance  Celtic  Germanic  Baltic  Finnic  and many Slavic languages  Polish  Slovak  Slovene  Croatian and Czech   as well as for others as Indonesian  Vietnamese  and Niger Congo languages  The Latin alphabet has varied in number of letters  When it was first adopted from the Etruscan alphabet  it contained only 21  22  Later   G   representing      formerly included under  C   was innovated to replace  Z   which was non functional  as the language had no voiced alveolar fricative at the time  23  The letters  Y  and  Z  were later added to represent the Greek Upsilon and Zeta respectively in Greek loanwords  23   W  was created in the 11th century from VV  It represented  w  in Germanic languages  not in Latin  which still uses  V  for the purpose   J  was distinguished from the original  I  only during the late Middle Ages along with the letter  U  from  V   23  Although some dictionaries use  J  it is for the most part eschewed for Latin text as non original  although other languages use it  Classical Latin did not contain punctuation  macrons  although apices were used to distinguish length in vowels   lowercase letters  24  or interword spacing  but the interpunct was used at times in Latin s history   So  a sentence originally written as  LVGETEOVENERESCVPIDINESQVE would be rendered in a modern edition as Lugete  O Veneres Cupidinesque or with macrons L g te    Vener s Cup din sque  and translated as Mourn  O Venuses and Cupids  A replica of the Old Roman Cursive inspired by the Vindolanda tablets The Roman cursive script is commonly found on the many wax tablets excavated at sites such as forts  an especially extensive set having been discovered at Vindolanda on Hadrian s Wall in Britain  Curiously enough  most of the Vindolanda tablets show spaces between words  though spaces were avoided in monumental inscriptions from that era   edit  Grammar Main article  Latin grammar Latin is a synthetic  fusional language  affixes  often suffixes  which usually encode more than one grammatical category  are attached to fixed stems to express gender  number  and case in adjectives  nouns  and pronouns a process called declension  Affixes are attached to fixed stems of verbs  as well  to denote person  number  tense  voice  mood  and aspect a process called conjugation   edit  Nouns Main article  Latin declension There are seven Latin noun cases  These mark a noun s syntactic role in the sentence  so word order is not as important in Latin as it is in some other languages  such as English  Words can typically be moved around in a sentence without significantly altering its meaning  although the emphasis may have been altered  True order of nouns is  Nominative   used when the noun is the subject or a predicate nominative  The thing or person acting  e g   the girl ran  puella cucurrit  or cucurrit puella Genitive   used when the noun is the possessor of an object  e g    the horse of the man   or  the man s horse  in both of these instances  the word man would be in the genitive case when translated into Latin   Also indicates material of which something greater is made  e g    a group of people    a number of gifts  people and gifts would be in the genitive case   Some nouns are genitive with special verbs and adjectives too   e g   The cup is full of wine  Poculum plenum vini est  The master of the slave had beaten him  Dominus servi eum verberaverat   Dative   used when the noun is the indirect object of the sentence  with special verbs  with certain prepositions  and if used as agent  reference  or even possessor   e g   The merchant hands over the stola to the woman  Mercator feminae stolam tradit   Accusative   used when the noun is the direct object of the sentence phrase  with certain prepositions  or as the subject of an infinitive  The thing or person having something done to them   e g   The slave woman carries the wine  Ancilla vinum portat   In addition  there are certain constructions where the accusative can be used for the subject of a clause  one being the indirect statement  Vocative   used when the noun is used in a direct address  The vocative form of a noun is the same as the nominative except for second declension nouns ending in  us  The  us becomes an  e or if it ends in  ius  such as filius  then the ending is just  i  fili   as distinct from the plural nominative  filii     e g    Master   shouted the slave   Domine   servus clamavit   Ablative used when the noun demonstrates separation or movement from a source  cause  agent  or instrument  or when the noun is used as the object of certain prepositions  adverbial   e g   You walked with the boy  tu cum puero ambulavisti   Locative  used to indicate a location and services  corresponding to the English  in  or  at    This is far less common than the other six cases of Latin nouns and usually applies to cities  small towns  and islands smaller than the island of Rhodes  but not including Rhodes  along with a few common nouns  In the first and second declension singular  its form coincides with the genitive  Roma becomes Romae   in Rome    In the plural  and in the other declensions  it coincides with the dative and ablative  Athenae becomes Athenis   at Athens    In the case of the fourth declension word domus the locative form  domi   at home   differs from the standard form of all the other cases  Latin lacks definite and indefinite articles  thus puer currit can mean either  the boy is running  or  a boy is running    edit  Verbs Main article  Latin conjugation Verbs in Latin are usually identified by four main conjugations  groups of verbs with similarly inflected forms  The first conjugation is typified by active infinitive forms ending in   re  the second by active infinitives ending in   re  the third by active infinitives ending in  ere  and the fourth by active infinitives ending in   re  However  there are exceptions to these rules  Further  there is a subset of the 3rd conjugation  the  i  verbs  which behave somewhat like the 4th conjugation  There are six general tenses in Latin  present  imperfect  future  perfect  pluperfect  and future perfect   three grammatical moods  indicative  imperative and subjunctive  in addition to the infinitive  participle  gerund  gerundive and supine   three persons  first  second  and third   two numbers  singular and plural   two voices  active and passive   and a few aspects  Verbs are described by four principal parts  The first principal part is the first person  or third person for impersonal verbs  singular  present tense  indicative mood  active voice form of the verb  or passive voice for verbs lacking an active voice   The second principal part is the present infinitive active  or passive for verbs lacking an active  form  The third principal part is the first person  or third person for impersonal verbs  singular  perfect indicative active  or passive when there is no active  form  The fourth principal part is the supine form  or alternatively  the nominative singular  perfect passive participle form of the verb  The fourth principal part can show either one gender of the participle  or all three genders   us for masculine   a for feminine  and  um for neuter   It can also be the future participle when the verb cannot be made passive  Most modern Latin dictionaries  if only showing one gender  tend to show the masculine  however  many older dictionaries will instead show the neuter  The fourth principal part is sometimes omitted for intransitive verbs  although strictly in Latin these can be made passive if used impersonally  There are six tenses in the Latin language  these are the present  future  future perfect  imperfect  perfect  and pluperfect  They each have a set of endings corresponding to the person and number referred to  This means that subject pronouns  e g  ego  I   tend to be included only for emphasis or contrast  The following table lists the endings for the active voice of each of these tenses  Tense 1st singular ending 2nd singular ending 3rd singular ending 1st plural ending 2nd plural ending 3rd plural ending Future Perfect  ero  eris  erit  erimus  eritis  erint Future  bo   am  bis   es  bit   et  bimus   emus  bitis   etis  bunt   ent Present  o  s  t  mus  tis  nt Imperfect  bam  bas  bat  bamus  batis  bant Perfect  i  isti  it  imus  istis  erunt Pluperfect  eram  eras  erat  eramus  eratis  erant  edit  Vocabulary As Latin is an Italic language  most of its vocabulary is likewise Italic  deriving ultimately from PIE  However  because of close cultural interaction  the Romans not only had adapted the Etruscan alphabet to form the Latin alphabet  but also had borrowed some Etruscan words into their language  including persona  mask  and histrio  actor   25  Latin also included vocabulary borrowed from Oscan  another Italic language  After the Fall of Tarentum  272 BC   the Romans began hellenizing  or adopting features of Greek culture  including the borrowing of Greek words  such as camera  vaulted roof   sumbolum  symbol   and balineum  bath   25  This hellenization led to the addition of  Y  and  Z  to the alphabet to represent Greek sounds  26  Subsequently the Romans transplanted Greek art  medicine  science and philosophy to Italy  paying almost any price to entice Greek skilled and educated persons to Rome  and sending their youth to be educated in Greece  Thus  many Latin scientific and philosophical words were Greek loanwords or had their meanings expanded by association with Greek words  as ars  craft  and        27  Because of the Roman Empire s expansion and subsequent trade with outlying European tribes  the Romans borrowed some northern and central European words  such as beber  beaver   of Germanic origin  and bracae  breeches   of Celtic origin  27  The specific dialects of Latin across Latin speaking regions of the former Roman Empire after its fall were influenced by languages specific to the regions  These spoken Latins evolved into particular Romance languages  During and after the adoption of Christianity into Roman society  Christian vocabulary became a part of the language  formed either from Greek or Hebrew borrowings  or as Latin neologisms  28  Continuing into the Middle Ages  Latin incorporated many more words from surrounding languages  including Old English and other Germanic languages  Over the ages Latin speaking populations produced new adjectives  nouns and verbs by affixing or compounding meaningful segments  29  For example  the compound adjective  omnipotens   all powerful   was produced from the adjectives omnis   all   and potens   powerful   by dropping the final s of omnis and concatenating  Often the concatenation changed the part of speech  i e   nouns were produced from verb segments or
