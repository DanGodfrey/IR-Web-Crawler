armed forces announced an objective to create a professional army by the end of 2010  8   edit  Argentina Argentina suspended military conscription in 1995 and replaced it with a voluntary military service  yet those already in service had to finish their time in service  9  This came as a result of political and social distrust of the military  dwindling budgets which forced the military to induct fewer conscripts every year  the experience of the 1982 Falklands War which proved the superiority of professional servicemen over conscripts and a series of conscription related brutality scandals which came to a head with the murder of Private Omar Carrasco at an Army base in 1994  following a brutal disciplinary action  It should be noted that military conscription has not been abolished  the Mandatory Military Service Law is still in the books and might be enforced in times of war  crisis or national emergency  Conscription was known in Argentina as la colimba  The word colimba is a composite word made from the initial syllables of the verbs correr  to run   limpiar  to clean  and barrer  to sweep   as it was perceived that all a conscript did during service was running  cleaning and sweeping  Conscripts themselves were known and referred to as  colimbas    edit  Australia See main article  Conscription in Australia Although various levels of conscription were in force during times of conflict  World War I  World War II  the Korean War  and the Vietnam War   as of 2011 update Australia has no conscription  All forms of conscription were abolished by the Whitlam Government in 1972  10   edit  Barbados Barbados has no conscription  11  The country has set the minimum age for voluntary recruitment into the Barbados Defence Force at 18  Younger recruits may be conscripted with parental consent   edit  Belgium Belgium suspended conscription on 31 December 1992 by amending the 1962 Law on Conscription  which became applicable only to conscripts drafted in 1993 and earlier  In practice this meant that the law no longer applied to those born in 1975 and later  Since 1 March 1995 the Belgian armed forces consist of professional volunteers only  12   edit  Belize Belize has set minimum age for voluntary recruitment into the Armed Forces at 18   According to the Section 16 of the Defense Act of the Defence Ordinance of 1977   Conscription has never been prescribed in the Defense Act  but is at the Governor General s discretion   edit  Bosnia and Herzegovina Bosnia and Herzegovina abolished compulsory military service as of 1 January 2007  13   edit  Bulgaria Bulgaria abolished compulsory military service  The last conscripts were sent home on 25 November 2007  14  15  16  Previously there was mandatory military service for male citizens from eighteen to twenty seven years of age  Duration of the service depended on the degree of education  For citizens studying for or holding a bachelor degree or higher the service was six months  and for citizens with no higher education it was nine months  17  The duration of service was two years in 1994  and was dropping steadily  until it was finally abolished   edit  Canada See main articles  Conscription Crisis of 1917 and Conscription Crisis of 1944 In Canada  conscription has never taken place in peacetime  Conscription became a very controversial issue during both World War I and World War II  especially in the province of Quebec   edit  China  PRC  Conscription has existed in theory since the establishment of the People s Republic of China in 1949  however  because of China s huge population and therefore the large number of individuals who volunteer to join the regular armed forces  a draft has never been enforced  Nowadays  every Chinese citizen  male and female  who is going to attend a study in a high school or a university  is required to attend a military training around 20 days  sometime in a troop  sometine in the campus   as a part of the military education  The result is  every one who finished a study in a university will be trained for 30 40 days  Conscription is enshrined in Article 55 of the Constitution  which states   It is a sacred duty of every citizen of the People s Republic of China to defend his or her motherland and resist invasion  It is an honored Obligation of the citizens of the People s Republic of China to perform military service and to join the militia forces   18  As of 1998  the legal basis of conscription was stated to be the 1984 Military Service Law  which describes military service as a duty for  all citizens without distinction of race       and religious creed   This law has not been amended since it came into effect  18  Military service is normally performed in the regular armed forces  but the 1984 law does allow for conscription into the reserve forces  Hong Kong and Macau SAR residents  as of 1997 and 1999 respectfully  are forbidden from joining the military   edit  Costa Rica Costa Rica abolished its military in 1948  See Military of Costa Rica  edit  Croatia On 3 October 2007  the government proposed to the parliament of the Republic of Croatia a decision to suspend all compulsory military service  This was supported by President Stjepan Mesi   and after a vote in the parliament on 5 October 2007  the decision became official  As of 1 January 2008  obligatory military  or civil  service is replaced with voluntary military service  19   edit  Czech Republic The Czech Republic abolished compulsory military service on 31 December 2004  20  21   edit  France Modern conscription was invented during the French Revolution  when the Republic wanted a stronger defense and to expand its radical ideas throughout Europe  The 1798 Jourdan Act stated   Any Frenchman is a soldier and owes himself to the defense of the nation   Thus Napoleon Bonaparte could create afterward the Grande Arm e with which he set out on the first large intra European war  France suspended peacetime military conscription in 1996  while those born before 1979 had to complete their service  22  since the Algerian War  1954 62   conscripts had not been deployed abroad or in war zones  except those volunteering for such deployments   edit  Germany See main article  Conscription in Germany On the 15th November 2010  the German government voted in favour of suspending universal conscription with the aim of establishing a professional army by 1 July 2011  The last conscripts were drafted on 1 January 2011  23   edit  Hungary Hungary abolished mandatory military service by November 2004  after the parliament had modified the constitution  ending a long standing political dispute  To restore drafting  a two thirds vote in parliament is needed  which is unlikely in the short term  As of 2011 update   the country is developing a professional army  with strong emphasis on  contract soldiers  who voluntarily serve 4 4 years for a wage  citation needed  In December  2011  the National Assembly re established the possibility of mandatory military service for every male citizen   with Hungarian address   between the age of 18 and the age of 40  Even though drafting is still banned in peace time  the listing of citizens fit for military service starts in January  2012  According to the legislation  the conscripts can only be drafted in  state of emergency  or as defensive measure  the National Assembly can authorise drafting   24   edit  India India has never had mandatory military service  either under British rule or since independence in 1947  In WWII the Indian Army became the largest all volunteer force in history  rising to over 2 5 million men in size  And it has since maintained the world s third largest army and the world s largest all volunteer army   edit  Iraq Saddam Hussein s large Iraqi army was largely composed of conscripts  except for the elite Republican Guard  About 100 000 conscripts died during the First Persian Gulf War  also known as Operation Desert Storm  In the intervening years  Iraq s military suffered from decay and poor leadership  but there was still compulsory service  One program of note was  Ashbal Saddam  known as  Saddam s Cubs  where children were trained to defend Iraq through  toughening  exercises such as firearms training and dismembering live chickens with their teeth  Following the Second Persian Gulf War where the original military was disbanded  the Iraqi Army was recreated as a volunteer force with training overseen at first by the Coalition Provisional Authority and later by the American presence   edit  Ireland Ireland was initially exempt from conscription in the First World War  but in April 1918 new legislation empowered the government to extend it to Ireland  Although the government never implemented this legislation  it led to a Conscription Crisis in Ireland and politically pushed the country further to seek its independence from the UK  The Republic of Ireland has always had a fully voluntary military  it remains a neutral nation  25   edit  Italy Italy had mandatory military service  for men only  until 31 December 2004  The right to conscientious objection was legally recognized in 1972 so that a  non armed military service   or a community service  could be authorised as an alternative to those who required it  26  The Italian Parliament approved the suspension of the mandatory military service in 2004  with effect starting from 1 January 2005  and the Italian armed forces will now be entirely composed of professional volunteer troops  both male and female  27  except in case of war or serious international military crisis  when conscription can be implemented   edit  Jamaica In Jamaica the military service is voluntary from 18 years of age up  Younger recruits may be conscripted with parental consent   edit  Japan Japan s Self Defense Forces have been a volunteer force since their establishment in the 1950s  following the end of the Allied occupation  As the Japanese constitution expressly prohibits Japan from maintaining any offensive military force  conscription will most likely not be an issue in the near future   edit  Latvia Latvia abolished compulsory military service on 1 January 2007  28   edit  Lebanon See also  Lebanese Armed Forces Conscription Lebanon previously had mandatory military service of one year for men  On 4 May 2005  a new conscription system was adopted  making for a six month service  and pledging to end conscription within two years  By 10 February 2007 it did   edit  Luxembourg Luxembourg has a volunteer military  29   edit  Republic of Macedonia Republic of Macedonia abolished compulsory military service as of October 2006  30   edit  Mauritius Main article  Military of Mauritius Mauritius does not have a standing army but operates a paramilitary service manned by volunteering Police officers known as the Special Mobile Force   edit  Montenegro President of Montenegro Filip Vujanovi  has  as of 30 August 2006  abolished conscription for the military   edit  Morocco Morocco eliminated compulsory military service as of 31 August 2006  31   edit  Netherlands Main article  Conscription in the Netherlands The Netherlands established conscription for a territorial militia in 1814  simultaneously establishing a standing army which was to be manned by volunteers only  However  lack of sufficient volunteers caused the two components to be merged in 1819 into a  cadre militia  army  in which the bulk of troops were conscripts  led by professional officers and NCOs  This system remained in use until the end of the Cold War  Between 1991 and 1996  the Dutch armed forces phased out their conscript personnel and converted to an all volunteer force  The last conscript troops were inducted in 1995 and demobilized in 1996  Formally  the Netherlands has not abolished conscription  that is to say  the laws and systems which provide for the conscription of armed forces personnel remain in place  and Dutch citizens can still  theoretically  be mobilized in the event of a national emergency   edit  New Zealand See main article  Compulsory Military Training in New Zealand Conscription of men into the armed forces of New Zealand came into effect in 1940  and was abolished in 1972   edit  Pakistan Like India  Pakistan has always maintained a purely volunteer military  However  in the immediate aftermath of independence  and the 1948 war  at a time when the army was just reorganising from a colonial force to a new national army  militias raised for service from  the Frontier  Punjab and Kashmir were often raised from locals tribe  each tribe was given a quota and many of the individuals sent did not  volunteer  in the strictest sense  though many did    edit  Panama Panama officially abolished the entire military in 1992  and transformed it into National Police  Prior to that  the U S  invasion to Panama practically destroyed what was in that time the Defence Forces of Panama  in 1989   edit  Peru Peru abolished conscription in 1999  32   edit  Philippines The Philippines does not have compulsory military service  however military training is a compulsory part of the high school curriculum and is optional for the college curriculum  As the training lasts for only a few hours a week and is embedded in the school curriculum  students do not have to live away from their homes during the year they receive the training  Filipino citizens who refuse to undergo such training in their senior year of high school  known as Citizen s Advancement Tranining or CAT  are not eligible for graduation  Prior to 2003  CAT was oriented towards purely military skills but today  non military aspects have been added to the training programme  In college  military training  known as Reserved Officers  Training Corps or ROTC  is now one of the options for the compulsory National Service Training Programme  NSTP   the other two being Citizen Welfare Training Service  CWTS  and Literacy Training Service  LTS   ROTC was compulsory until 2001 when controversies surrounding officer misconduct prompted it to be reformed  Students are required to complete 6 units of NSTP to be eligible for graduation which is reduced from 12 units when ROTC was the sole option  6 units per year   Depending on the school which a student attends  military training may be oriented toward the army  navy or air force  Foreign citizens are exempt from undergoing the national service programmes  however  those who hold dual citizenship with one of them being Filipino are not  Those who are medically unfit to do military work may get a partial exemption  particularly from strenuous physical military activities   edit  Poland Poland suspended compulsory military service on 5 December 2008 by the order of the Minister of Defence  Compulsory military service was formally abolished when the Polish parliament amended the conscription law on 9 January 2009  the law came into effect on 11 February 2009   edit  Portugal Portugal abolished compulsory military service on 19 November 2004  33   edit  Romania Romania suspended compulsory military service on 23 October 2006  34  This came about due to a 2003 constitutional amendment which allowed the parliament to make military service optional  The Romanian Parliament voted to abolish conscription in October 2005  with the vote formalising one of many military modernisation and reform programmes that Romania agreed to when it joined NATO   edit  Serbia Main article  Conscription in Serbia Serbia abolished compulsory military service on 1 January 2011  Before that  Serbia had compulsory national service for all men aged between 19 and 35  In practice  men over 27 were seldom called up  Service was usually performed after university studies had been completed  The length of service was 12 months  then reduced to 9 months but was reduced to 6 months in 2006  There was also an alternative for conscientious objectors which lasted 9 months  Serbian nationals living outside of the country were still expected to complete national service  however  they could defer it if it would have seriously affected their career in the country where they then resided  This could be done by contacting the embassy in the country of residence  if under 27   or done by contacting the army directly  if over 27    edit  Slovakia Slovakia abolished compulsory military service on 1 January 2006   edit  Slovenia Slovenia s Prime Minister Anton Rop abolished mandatory military service on 9 September 2003  35   edit  South Africa South Africa under the apartheid system had two years of compulsory military service for white men  followed by camps at intervals  This was abolished in 1994  See End Conscription Campaign   edit  Spain Military service in Spain  1945  Spain abolished compulsory military service in 2001  36  Military and alternative service was nine months long and in recent years the majority of conscripts chose to perform alternative  rather than military  service   edit  Sri Lanka Sri Lanka has never had mandatory military service  either under British rule or since independence in 1948  It maintains an all volunteer military   edit  Sweden Since 1902  military service was mandatory in Sweden until 1 July 2010 37  when conscription was officially suspended during peace time  38  Before this  all Swedish men aged between 18 and 47 years old were eligible to serve with the armed forces  However  an alternative community service for conscientious objectors was easily available  and the number of men actually completing their service continued to decline   edit  Tanzania Tanzania officially never had conscription since it became independent  39   edit  United Kingdom Main article  Conscription in the United Kingdom The United Kingdom introduced conscription during both world wars  For the first two years of World War I the British relied on volunteers  But by 1916 the need for yet more soldiers to replace losses at the front forced the British Government to introduce conscription under the Military Service Act  Conscientious objectors were required to do war related work of an unarmed nature  and some of those who refused this alternative  or engaged in anti war protest  went to jail  Conscription was reintroduced in the UK in 1939 at the start of World War II  Besides the armed forces themselves  conscription was used to increase output in coal mining  see the  Bevin Boys   and other dimensions of the war effort  Later in the war women were conscripted into the Women s Land Army to help with agricultural production  Conscientious objectors were treated more leniently than in WWI  but could still go to prison if they refused war related work  For example the scientist Kathleen Lonsdale was sentenced to a month in Holloway prison in 1943 for refusing to register for war duties and refusing to pay a resulting fine of two pounds  40 Northern Ireland was exempt from conscription in the Second World War  and was also excluded from the post war National Service  After World War II  the Government re introduced conscription in 1948 under the title of compulsory National Service  This was abolished in 1960  The last conscript was not discharged until May 1963  due to deferrals   edit  United States Main article  Conscription in the United States The United States has employed conscription intermittently  For example  in 1863 the imposition of a draft during the Civil War touched off the New York Draft Riots  Conscription was next used after the United States entered World War I in 1917  The first peacetime conscription came with the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940  Active conscription   the draft   ended in 1973  As of 2011 update   male U S  citizens  if aged eighteen through twenty five  are required to register with the Selective Service System  whose mission is  to provide manpower to the armed forces in an emergency  including a  Health Care Personnel Delivery System  41  and  to run an Alternative Service Program for men classified as conscientious objectors during a draft   No one has been prosecuted for violating the conscription law in the USA since 1986  Women do not register for Selective Service in the United States  but they may enlist for voluntary service   edit  Countries with mandatory military service See also  Conscription  edit  Armenia Armenia has compulsory military service for two years for males from 18 to 27 years old   edit  Austria Austria has mandatory military service for fit male citizens from 18 to 35 years of age  Since 2006  the period of service has been six months  Conscientious objectors can join the civilian service  called Zivildienst  for nine months  A 12 month participation in the Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service  the Austrian Social Service or the Austrian Peace Service is regarded as an equivalent to the civilian service  Since 1 January 1998  females can join the military service voluntarily   edit  Belarus Belarus has mandatory military service for all fit men from eighteen to twenty seven years of age  Military service lasts for eighteen months for those without higher education  and for twelve months for those with higher education   edit  Bermuda Bermuda  although an overseas territory of the United Kingdom  still maintains conscription for its local force  Males between the ages of eighteen and thirty two are drawn by lottery to serve in The Bermuda Regiment for a period of thirty eight months  The commitment is only on a part time basis  however  Anyone who objects to this has the right to have his case heard by an exemption tribunal   edit  Brazil Males in Brazil are required to serve 12 months of military service upon their 18th birthday  While de jure all males are required to serve  numerous exceptions mean military service is de facto limited mostly to volunteers  with an average of between 5 and 10  of those reporting for duty actually being inducted  42  Most often  the service is performed in military bases as close as possible to the person s home  The government does not usually require those planning to attend college or holding a permanent job to serve  There are also several other exceptions  including health reasons  for which one may not have to serve  Recruits accepted at a university may also choose to train under a program similar to the American ROTC  and satisfy their military requirement this way  Direct entrance to one of the military academies will also substitute for this requirement   edit  Burma  Myanmar  This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  The Burmese junta requires able bodied persons aged 18 and over to register with local authorities  As of 2011 update   civil servants  students  those serving prison terms  and those caring for an elderly parent are excluded from the draft  but they could be later called to serve  Totally exempt are members of religious orders  disabled persons  and married or divorced women with children  Those who fail to report for military service could be imprisoned for three years  and face fines  Those who deliberately inflict injury upon themselves to avoid conscription could be imprisoned for up to five years  as well as fined   edit  Colombia Colombian Law 48 from 1993 establishes that all Colombian men are obligated to arrange their military situation when they reach 18 years of age   edit  Military

and fifty  Additionally  from 2008 onwards  all men belonging to the religious groups of Armenians  Latins and Maronites  also serve their military service  Military service lasts for twenty four months  After that  ex soldiers are considered reservists and participate in military exercises for a few days every year  Conscientious objectors can either do thirty three months  unarmed service in the army or thirty eight months  community work  43 Legislation and practice relating to civilian alternatives to military service remained punitive in nature  although new legislation which came into force in 2004 reduced the length of such alternative service  The Special Committee  which makes recommendations on applications for conscientious objection  proposed a blanket rejection of applications based on ideological grounds where applicants do not declare particular beliefs  AI called for a re evaluation of the Committee s methods and for the authorities to establish an alternative to military service of a purely civilian nature  outside the authority of the Ministry of Defence  44   edit  Denmark As described in the Constitution of Denmark  45    81  Denmark has mandatory service for all able men  Normal service is four months  and is normally served by men in the age of eighteen to twenty seven  Some special services will take longer  Danish men will typically receive a letter around the time of their 18th birthday  asking when their current education  if any  ends  and some time later  depending on when  they will receive a notice on when to attend to the draft office to be tested physically and psychologically  However  some may be deemed unfit for service and not be required to show up  Even if a person is deemed fit  or partially fit for service  he may avoid having to serve if he draws a high enough number randomly  Persons who are deemed partly fit for service will however be placed lower than those who are deemed fit for service  and therefore have a very low chance of being drafted  Men deemed fit can be called upon for service until their 50th birthday in case of national crisis  regardless of whether normal conscription has been served  This right is very rarely exercised by Danish authorities  Conscientious objectors can choose to instead serve six months in a non military position  for example in Beredskabsstyrelsen  dealing with non military disasters like fires  flood  pollution  etc   or foreign aid work in a third world country  46   edit  Egypt Main article  Conscription in Egypt Egypt has a mandatory military service program for males between the ages of eighteen and thirty  Conscription is regularly postponed for students until the end of their studies  as long as they apply before they turn twenty eight years of age  By the age of thirty  a male is considered unfit to join the army and pays a fine  Males with no brothers  or those supporting parents are exempted from the service  Former President Sadat added that any Egyptian who has dual nationality is exempted from military service and this is still in effect  Males serve for a period ranging from fourteen months to thirty six months  depending on their education  high school drop outs serve for thirty six months  College graduates serve for lesser periods of time  depending on their education  college graduates with special skills are still conscripted yet at a different rank and at a different pay scale with the option of remaining with the service as a career  Some Egyptians evade conscription and travel overseas until they reach the age of thirty  at which point they are tried  pay a  580 fine  as of 2004   and are dishonorably discharged  Such an offense  legally considered an offense of  bad moral character   prevents the  unpatriotic  citizen from ever holding public office   edit  Finland Main article  Conscription in Finland This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Finland has mandatory military service for men of a minimum duration of six months  180 days   depending on the assigned position  those trained as officers or NCOs serve for twelve months  362 days   specialist troops serve for nine  270 days  or twelve months  while rank and file serve for the minimum period  Unarmed service is also possible  and lasts nine months  270 days   The obligation to enter into service begins at the age of 19  and may be postponed to the age of 29  when it becomes either mandatory  or the conscript is exempted  47 Since 1995  women have been able to volunteer for military service  During the first 45 days  women have an option to quit at will  48  Having served for 45 days  they fall under the same obligation to serve as men except for medical reasons  A pregnancy during service would interrupt the service but not automatically cause a medical discharge  Belonging in a sexual minority does not result in an exemption  49  Transsexuals usually get their service postponed until they have undergone sex reassignment surgery  Non military service of twelve months is available for men whose conscience prevents them from serving in the military  Men who refuse to serve at all are sent to prison for six months or half the time of their remaining non military service at the time of refusal  In theory  male citizens from the demilitarized  land region are to serve in customs offices or lighthouses  but since this service has not been arranged  they are always exempted in practice  Jehovah s Witnesses  service is deferred for three years  if they present a written testimony  not older than two months  from the congregation of their status as baptized and active members of the congregation  Jehovah s Witnesses will be exempted from peace time duty at the beginning of the age 29  Military service has been mandatory for men throughout the history of independent Finland since 1917  Soldiers and civilian servicemen receive a daily allowance of  4 70  days 1   180    8  days 181   270   or  11 20  onward from day 271   47  Approximately 20  are trained as NCOs  corporals  sergeants   and 10  are trained as officers in reserve  second lieutenant   In wartime  it is expected that the officers in reserve fulfill most platoon leader and company commander positions  At the beginning of the service  all men go through same basic training of eight weeks  After this eight week period it is decided who will be trained as NCOs or officers  Having completed the initial part of the service as a conscript  the soldier is placed in the reserve  Reservists may be called for mandatory refresher exercises  Rank and file serve a maximum of 40 days  specialists 75 days and officers and NCOs 100 days  Per refresher course day  the reservists receive a taxable salary of about fifty euro  The salary depends slightly on the military rank  officers receive  56  NCOs  53 and rank and file  51 per day  The service is mandatory  it is not possible to refuse an order to attend the refresher exercise  only postpone  As of 2011 update   though  the option to opt for non military service has been made available as the Finnish Defence Forces has made ongoing budget cuts  reflected in the number of reservist exercises annually  There are no general exemptions for the conscription  The law requires employers  landlords etc  to continue any pre existing contracts after the service  For medical reasons  exemption or postponing can be given only by a military doctor  If the disability is expected to be cured  there is no exemption  and the service is postponed  The basic doctrine is that the great majority of each age cohort serve  and the size of the active army can be adjusted by changing the maximum age of reservists to be called up  instead of using selective service  The option to military service is civilian service  available to females after completing 45 days of military service   where an individual subject to conscript finds a job at some public institution  where they serve for 12 months  the same as the longest rank and file service  drivers   Before 2008  the law required 13 months  which was criticized for being punitive internationally by the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations  The European Committee of Social Rights  The Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe and Amnesty International  50  The national security policy of Finland is based on a credible independent defence of all Finnish territory  The maximum number of military personnel abroad is limited to 2 000  out of the 900 000 available reserve   Contributions to the UN troops comprise only professional soldiers and trained  paid reservists who have specifically applied to such operations  Therefore  no  expeditionary wars  argument can be made against conscription  Draft dodging is nearly non existent  as failure to show up to conscription immediately leads to an arrest warrant and is prosecuted as absence without leave  or desertion after five days of absence  Proof of military or civil service is generally required to obtain a 5 year passport  some exceptions can apply   Without proof  the passport is valid  at the longest  until the applicant s 28th birthday  51  Political opposition to conscription is rather marginalized and heavily associated with communist or anarchist groups  Particularly  the  Defenders of Peace   Rauhanpuolustajat   who opposed military readiness  were supported by the Soviets during the Cold War era  Therefore  opposition to conscription is still heavily associated with anti patriotism and communism  Military rank  either as NCO or reserve officer  is highly valued as a merit in Finland by employers when recruiting a male employee  A great majority of Finnish males who hold a managerial position in Finland have either NCO or officer rank in reserves   edit  Greece Main article  Conscription in Greece As of 2009 update   Greece  Hellenic Republic  has mandatory military service of nine months for men  Although Greece is developing a professional army system  it continues to enforce the 9 month mandatory military service despite earlier promises that the draft would be reduced to six months  Women are accepted into the Greek army as salaried professionals  but they are not obliged to join as men are  Conscript soldiers receive full health insurance and a nominal salary of  9 per month for privates and  12 for the rank of draft corporal and draft sergeant  The minimum wage for an unskilled worker stands at around  650 per month in Greece  while professional soldiers are paid upwards of  800  This results in reservist corporals and sergeants receiving a wage that is 1 70th that of a professional soldier  whom they outrank  The symbolic conscript  wages  are not sufficient to sustain a draftee serving his tour away from his place of residence and most draftees depend on their parents to support them financially while they are on their tour   edit  Conscientious objection to military service  Greece  The length of alternative civilian service for conscientious objectors to military service remained punitive at 42 months  dubious   discuss Amnesty International was also concerned that the determination of conscientious objector status fell under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense  which breaches international standards that stipulate that the entire institution of alternative service should have a civilian character   edit  Iran Iran has a mandatory military service for men which starts at the age of 18  Duration of military service is dependent on some conditions and circumstances  There is a 20 month military service for general  18 months for destitute areas and 16 months for boundary areas  there is two months for military education  There are exceptions for those who cannot serve because of physical or mental health problems or disabilities  Students are exempt as long as they are attending school  The higher the education of a man  the higher his rank will be in the military service  Since 2008 and the commence of Iran s national elites organization activity  Bonyade Mellie Nokhbegan 52    students who are accepted as members of this organization  because of their special achievements  e g   national and international olympiad medals and winners of invention competitions  can have a  scientific research  substitution instead of mandatory military service  and the research grant is given to these members from military universities  otherwise  formally these members are regarded as  soldiers  who are spending the mandatory military service program  and in any publication related to that research  their citations have to be that of the military university giving the research grant  Exemptions from the Iranian military service  but also military duty in case of war include  Sole Children  Men who do not have brothers or sisters under the ideology that their mother and or father need the assistance of their only son  Sole Son  Men who are the only male in their family and his father is over 59 years old  Men who are the sole carers of a disabled or mentally problematic parent  sibling  or 2nd line family members  Doctors  firefighters and other emergency workers who their uptake for military duty or service jeopardizes local health and emergency services  Workers of vital government institutions that assist or indirectly serve the military  exempt at time of war   Workers of businesses that serve the military  e g  military equipment factories  exempt at time of war   and also having 3 brother which pass the conscription  Prisoners may be excused of their sentence to serve in the military at a time of war or to complete military service in exchange for a reduced sentence dependent on the nature of the crime committed  53  Men reaching 18 years old who are not granted exemption from the military service are not able to apply for a driving license  passport  or leave the country without special permission   edit  Israel Israel has mandatory military service for both men and women  All Israeli citizens are conscripted at age 18  with the following exceptions  Haredim are eligible for a deferral during their religious studies  which essentially becomes an exemption  Israeli Arabs are exempt from conscription  although they may volunteer  The men of other non Jewish communities in Israel  notably the Druze  Bedouin  and Circassians  are conscripted  women are not though may volunteer  Religiously observant Jewish women can apply for an exemption from army service  Although some choose to serve  many opt to serve voluntarily in civilian  national service  Sherut Leumi  Women are not inducted if they are married or pregnant  Candidates who do not qualify on grounds of mental or physical health  Typically  men are required to serve for 3 years and women for 24 months  5  Officers and other soldiers in certain voluntary units such as Nahal and Hesder are required to sign on for additional service  Those studying in a  Mechina   pre induction preparatory course  defer service until the conclusion of the program  typically one academic year  An additional program  called  Atuda i   for qualified applicants allows post secondary academic studies prior to induction  See also  Israel Defence Forces  There is a very limited amount of conscientious objection to conscription into the IDF  More common is refusal by reserve soldiers to serve in the West Bank and Gaza  Some of these conscientious objectors may be assigned to serve elsewhere  or are sentenced to brief prison terms lasting a few months to a year and may subsequently receive dishonourable discharges  See also  Refusal to serve in the Israeli military  After a year their period of regular army service  men are liable for up to 30 days  much less on average  per year of reserve duty   miluim   until they are in their early forties  Women in certain positions of responsibility are liable for reserve duty to a limited extent  until they are twenty four years old  married  or pregnant   edit  South Korea Main article  Conscription in South Korea South Korea has mandatory military service of 22 months  There are no alternatives for conscientious objectors 54  except imprisonment  In general  with very few exceptions  most South Korean males serve in the military  The duration of service varies from branch to branch of the military  Exemptions are granted to Korean male citizens with physical disabilities or whose mental status is unstable or questionable  When a Korean man becomes of legal age  he is required to take a physical check up to determine whether he is suitable for military service  Every male is labeled into one of four different grades  Grades 1 3  normal  Grade 4  special service  Grade 4  special service is given to individuals that fulfill their military duties as a civil worker amongst civilians  There are some controversies portrayed in Korean media concerning special treatment given to celebrities  Some celebrities are given exemptions to their mandatory military service  even though they clearly have no physical disabilities  The government has begun implementing tougher sanctions to those who attempt to avoid their military duty  It is considered shameful  undutiful  and treasonous for a man to take measures to avoid his military service when he is healthy and capable of fulfilling his 22 month requirement  citation needed  In 2002 Yoo Seung Jun  a Korean pop singer  became a naturalized American citizen to avoid his military duty in Korea  For this reason  Korea has banned Yoo from the country and actually deported him  55  56  Another recent example is MC Mong  a popular singer rapper accused of avoiding his military service by having his molar teeth removed  On 11 April 2011  MC Mong was sentenced to a suspended jail term of 6 months  probation for one year  and 120 hours of community service  57   edit  Mexico As of 2011 update   all males reaching eighteen years of age must register for military service  Servicio Militar Nacional  or SMN  for one year  though selection is made by a lottery system using the following color scheme  whoever draws a black ball must serve as a  disponibility reservist   that is  he must not follow any activities whatsoever and get his discharge card at the end of the year  The ones who get a white ball serve Saturdays in a Batall n del Servicio Militar Nacional  National Military Service Battalion  composed entirely of one year SMN conscripts  Those with a community service interest may participate in Literacy Campaigns as teachers or as physical education instructors  Military service is also  voluntarily  open to women  In certain cities  such as Mexico City and Veracruz  there is a third option  a red ball  Mexico City  and a Blue ball  Veracruz   which entails serving a full year as a recruit in a Paratrooper Battalion in the case of Mexico City residents  or an Infanter a de Marina unit  Navy Marines  in Veracruz  In other cities which have a Navy HQ  such as Ciudad Madero   it is the Navy which takes charge of the conscripts  instead of the Army  Draft dodging was an uncommon occurrence in Mexico until 2002  since a  liberated  military ID card was needed for a Mexican male to obtain a passport  but since this requirement was dropped  absenteeism from military service has become much more common   edit  Norway Norway has mandatory military service of nineteen months for men between the ages of 18 5  17 with parental consent  and 44  55 in case of war   Beginning in 2006  the armed forces will also invite females to take a pre service medical examination  but they will not be drafted unless they sign a declaration of willingness  The actual draft time is six months for the home guard  and twelve months for the regular army  air force and navy  The remaining months are supposed to be served in annual exercises  but very few conscripts do this because of lack of funding for the Norwegian armed forces  As a result of this decreased funding and greater reliance on high technology  the armed forces are aiming towards drafting only 10 000 conscripts a year  As of 2011 update   an average of 27  of young men actually complete military service each year  58  The remainder  for the most part  either are formally dismissed after medical tests or obtain deferral from the service because of studies or stays abroad  Some  such as those who choose vocational course paths during high school  for example  carpenters and electricians  opt to complete their required apprenticeships within the military  While some Norwegians consider it unfair that they have to complete the compulsory military duty when so many others are dismissed  others see it as a privilege and there is normally high competition to be allowed to join some branches of the service  citation needed  The Norwegian armed forces will normally not draft a person who has reached the age of 28  In Norway  certain voluntary specialist training programs and courses entail extended conscription of one to eight years  Pacifists can apply for non military service  which lasts 12 months   edit  Russia Main article  Conscription in Russia The conscription system was introduced into Imperial Russia by Dmitry Milyutin on 1 January 1874  As of 2008  the Russian Federation has a mandatory 12 months draft  Some examples of how people avoid being drafted are  Studying in a university or similar place  All full time students are free from conscription  but they can be drafted after they graduate  or if they drop out   Graduated students serve one year as privates  but if they have a military education  they have the option to serve two years as officers  Persons who continue full time postgraduate education  or have an academic degree  Candidate of Science  PhD  Doctor of Science  are not drafted  Getting a medical certificate that shows that a person is unfit for service  Having more than two children  In Russia  a person can be conscripted at the age 18   27  i e  a man can t be drafted after he turns twenty seven  In 2006  the Russian government and State Duma gradually reduced the term of service to 18 months from 24 for those who will be conscripted in 2007 and to 12 months from 2008 and dropped some legal excuses for non conscription from the law  such as non conscription of rural doctors and teachers  of men who have a child younger than 3 years  etc   from 1 January 2008  Also full time students graduated from civil university with military education will be free from conscription from 1 January 2008  As a result of draft evasion  Russian generals have repeatedly complained that the bulk of the army is made up of drug addicts  imbeciles  and ex convicts  which in turn has led to an overall decline of the morale and function of the Russian armed services  Conscripts often face brutal hazing and bullying upon their entrance into the military  known as dedovshchina  some dying as a result  See also Conscription through detention in Russia s armed forces Only eleven percent of Russian men enter mandatory military service   edit  Singapore Main article  National Service in Singapore In Singapore  the NS  Amendment  Act was passed on 14 March 1967  under which all able bodied male citizens of 18   21 years of age were required to serve 24 months of compulsory national service in the Singapore Armed Forces  the Singapore Police Force  or the Singapore Civil Defence Force  Upon completion of full time NS  they undergo reservist training cycles of up to forty days a year for the next ten years  The majority of conscripts serve in the Singapore Armed Forces due to its larger manpower requirements  Almost all conscripts undergo basic military training before being deployed to the various services  the police  or Civil Defence  conscripts do not have the opportunity to choose their assignment  Conscripts  known as National Servicemen  hold leadership positions as Specialists or commissioned officers  Singapore used to have one of the longest mandatory military service periods for males  at thirty months prior to 2005   edit  Switzerland Main article  Conscription in Switzerland Military service for Swiss men is obligatory according to the Federal Constitution  and includes 18 or 21 weeks of basic training  depending on troop category  as well as annual 3 week refresher courses until a number of service days which increases with rank  260 days for privates  is reached   It is also possible to serve the whole requirement at one piece  meaning no refresher courses are required   Service for women is voluntary  but identical in all respects  Conscientious objectors can choose 390 days of community service instead of military service  Medical deferments and dismissals from basic training  often on somewhat dubious grounds  have increased significantly in the last years  Therefore  only about 55  to 60  of Swiss men actually complete basic training   edit  Taiwan  ROC  Main article  Conscription in the Republic of China The Republic of China has had mandatory military service for all males since 1949  Females from the outlying islands of Fuchien were also required to serve in a civil defense role  although this requirement has been dropped since the lifting of martial law  In October 1999  the mandatory service was shortened from twenty four months to twenty two months  from January 2004 it was shortened further to eighteen months  and from 1 January 2006 the duration has decreased to sixteen months  The ROC Defense Ministry had announced that should voluntary enlistment reach sufficient numbers  the compulsory service period for draftees will be shortened to fourteen months in 2007  and further to twelve months in 2009  59  60  ROC nationals with Overseas Chinese status are exempt from service  Draftees may also request alternative service  usually in community service areas  although the required service period would be longer than military service  Qualified draftees with graduate degrees in the sciences or engineering who pass officer candidate exams may also apply to fulfil their obligations in a national defense service option which involves three months of military training  followed by an officer commission in the reserves and four years working in technical jobs in the defense industry or government research institutions  The Ministry of Interior is responsible for administering the National Conscription Agency  61  On 1 August 2008  the Defence Minister announced that from 2014 on  Taiwan would have a purely volunteer professional force  However  males who opt not to volunteer will be subjected to three to four month military training  Those who do not have a tertiary education will have a three month training when reaching military age  whereas those who are receiving tertiary education will have to complete the training in summer vacations  62  Should this policy remain unchanged  although Taiwan will have a purely volunteer professional force  every male will still be conscripted to receive a three to four month military training  Thus  after 2014  compulsory military service will still remain in practice in Taiwan   edit  Turkey Main article  Conscription in Turkey In Turkey  compulsory military service applies to all male citizens from twenty to forty one years of age  with some exceptions   Those who are engaged in higher education or vocational training programs prior to their military drafting are allowed to delay service until they have completed the programs  or reach a certain age  depending on the program  e g  29 years of age for undergraduate degrees   The duration of the basic military service varies  As of July 2003  the reduced durations are as follows  fifteen months for privates  previously eighteen months   twelve months for reserve officers  previously sixteen months  and six months for short term privates  which denotes those who have earned a university degree and have not been enlisted as reserve officers  previously eight months   For Turkish citizens who have lived or worked abroad of Turkey for at least three years  on condition that they pay a certain fee in foreign currencies  a basic military training of twenty one days  previously twenty eight days  was offered instead of the full term military service   edit  that was changed in 2011  21 days basic military training removed  only fee required  Also  when the General Staff assesses that the military reserve exceeds the required amount  paid military service of one month s basic training is established by law as a stopgap measure  but has only been practiced in reality once so far  and only applied to men of a certain age  born in or prior to 1973   This was done in order to generate funds to recover from the aftermath of the 1999  zmit earthquake  which took place in the highly industrialized Marmara region of the country  and had a considerable negative impact on the Turkish economy due to the severe damage it caused to a significant number of residential and industrial structures  Although women in principle are not obliged to serve in the military  they are allowed to become military officers  Conscientious objection of military service is illegal in Turkey and punishable with imprisonment by law  Many conscientious objectors flee abroad mainly to neighbouring countries or the European Union  as asylum seekers or guest workers    edit  Ukraine The options are either reserve officer training for two years  offered in universities as a part of a program which means not having to join the army   or one year regular service  In Ukraine  a person could not be conscripted after he turned twenty five  The Ukrainian army had similar problems with dedovshchina as the Russian army did until very recently  but in Ukraine the problem is getting less severe compared to Russia  due to cuts in the conscript terms  from 24 months to 18 months in the early 2000s and then to 12 months in 2004  and cuts in total conscription numbers  due to the switching of the army into a full time professional army  since the last conscripts may be drafted until the end of 2015  63   edit  See also Conscription Volunteer military National service
