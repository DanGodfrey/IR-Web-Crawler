Bretton Woods system From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search This article may contain original research  Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding references  Statements consisting only of original research may be removed  More details may be available on the talk page   October 2010  The Bretton Woods system of monetary management established the rules for commercial and financial relations among the world s major industrial states in the mid 20th century  The Bretton Woods system was the first example of a fully negotiated monetary order intended to govern monetary relations among independent nation states  Preparing to rebuild the international economic system as World War II was still raging  730 delegates from all 44 Allied nations gathered at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods  New Hampshire  United States  for the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference  The delegates deliberated upon and signed the Bretton Woods Agreements during the first three weeks of July 1944  Setting up a system of rules  institutions  and procedures to regulate the international monetary system  the planners at Bretton Woods established the International Monetary Fund  IMF  and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development  IBRD   which today is part of the World Bank Group  These organizations became operational in 1945 after a sufficient number of countries had ratified the agreement  The chief features of the Bretton Woods system were an obligation for each country to adopt a monetary policy that maintained the exchange rate by tying its currency to the U S  dollar and the ability of the IMF to bridge temporary imbalances of payments  On August 15  1971  the United States unilaterally terminated convertibility of the dollar to gold  As a result    t he Bretton Woods system officially ended and the dollar became fully  fiat currency   backed by nothing but the promise of the federal government   1  This action  referred to as the Nixon shock  created the situation in which the United States dollar became a reserve currency used by many states  At the same time  many fixed currencies  such as GBP  for example   also became free floating  Contents 1 Origins 1 1 Great Depression 1 1 1 Economic security 1 1 2 Rise of governmental intervention 1 1 3 Atlantic Charter 1 1 4

edit  Origins The political basis for the Bretton Woods system was in the confluence of several key conditions  the shared experiences of the Great Depression  the concentration of power in a small number of states  further enhanced by the exclusion of a number of important nations because of the war    edit  Great Depression A high level of agreement among the powerful on the goals and means of international economic management facilitated the decisions reached by the Bretton Woods Conference  Its foundation was based on a shared belief in capitalism  Although the developed countries  governments differed in the type of capitalism they preferred for their national economies  France  for example  preferred greater planning and state intervention  dirigisme   whereas the United States favored relatively limited state intervention   citation needed  all relied primarily on market mechanisms and private ownership of means of production  Thus  it is their similarities rather than their differences that appear most striking  All the participating governments at Bretton Woods agreed that the monetary chaos of the interwar period had yielded several valuable lessons  The experience of the Great Depression was fresh on the minds of public officials  The planners at Bretton Woods hoped to avoid a repeat of the debacle of the 1930s  when intransigent insistence by creditor nations on the repayment of Allied war debts and reparations  combined with an inclination to isolationism  led to a breakdown of the international financial system and a worldwide economic depression  2  The so called  beggar thy neighbor  policies that emerged as the crisis continued saw some trading nations using currency devaluations in an attempt to increase their competitiveness  i e  raise exports and lower imports    though recent research suggest this de facto inflationary policy probably off set some of the contractionary forces in world price levels  see Eichengreen  How to Prevent a Currency War    Despite devaluation policy increasing national liquidity these national policy responses were neither deep enough or coordinated enough to restore international trade volume  Over the run of the decade  world markets never broke through the haphazardly constructed nationally motivated and imposed barriers and restricts on international trade and investment volume  The various anarchic and often autarkic protectionist and neo merchantilist national policies   often mutually inconsistent   that emerged over the first half of the decade though variously intended  in the event  worked inconsistently and self defeatingly to promote national import substitution  increase national exports  divert foreign investment and trade flows  and even prevent certain categories of cross border trade and investment out right  These national policies included exclusionary trading blocs  currency zones  groups of nations that use an equivalent currency  such as the  Sterling Area  of the British Empire   bilateral barter mechanisms  see Nazi era German trade policy   etc  Together  they not only slowed the recovery of international trade  they clogged the cross border flow of capital and foreign investment  As a consequence of these uncoordinated inward looking mutually contradictory national policies  international trade and investment stagnated   and crucially contemporaneous expert perceptions of the  whys   of this stagnation best summed up in the phrase  beggar thy neighbor   decisively conditioned notions of a better global trade and investment system  next time   When many of these same expert observers reared on the 30 s debacle became the architects of a new unified post war system at Bretton Woods  the watch words became  no more beggar thy neighbor   Preventing a repetition of this process of competitive devaluations became job one  Of course today  these key 30 s events look different to careful scholars of the era  see the work of Barry Eichengreen  Golden Fetters  The Gold Standard and the Great Depression  1919 1939  and  How to Prevent a Currency War   in particular devaluations today are viewed by advanced scholars with far greater nuance  Ben Bernanke s opinion on the subject follows        T he proximate cause of the world depression was a structurally flawed and poorly managed international gold standard    For a variety of reasons  including among others a desire of the Federal Reserve to curb the US stock market boom  monetary policy in several major countries turned contractionary in the late 1920s a contraction that was transmitted worldwide by the gold standard  What was initially a mild deflationary process began to snowball when the banking and currency crises of 1931 instigated an international  scramble for gold   Sterilization of gold inflows by surplus countries  the USA and France   substitution of gold for foreign exchange reserves  and runs on commercial banks all led to increases in the gold backing of money  and consequently to sharp unintended declines in national money supplies  Monetary contractions in turn were strongly associated with falling prices  output and employment  Effective international cooperation could in principle have permitted a worldwide monetary expansion despite gold standard constraints  but disputes over World War I reparations and war debts  and the insularity and inexperience of the Federal Reserve  among other factors  prevented this outcome  As a result  individual countries were able to escape the deflationary vortex only by unilaterally abandoning the gold standard and re establishing domestic monetary stability  a process that dragged on in a halting and uncoordinated manner until France and the other Gold Bloc countries finally left gold in 1936    from  Great Depression  B  Bernanke  At any rate  in 1944 at Bretton Woods  as a result of the collective conventional wisdom of the time  Elite policy circles  gathered there from all the leading allied nations  collectively favored a regulated system of fixed exchange rates  indirectly disciplined by a US dollar tied to gold   a system that relied on a regulated market economy with tight controls on the value of currencies  Although the various national experts disagreed to some degree on the specific implementation of this system  all agreed on the need for tight controls   edit  Economic security Cordell Hull  US Secretary of State 1933 44 Also based on experience of the inter war years  U S  planners developed a concept of economic security   that a liberal international economic system would enhance the possibilities of postwar peace  One of those who saw such a security link was Cordell Hull  the United States Secretary of State from 1933 to 1944  Notes 1  Hull believed that the fundamental causes of the two world wars lay in economic discrimination and trade warfare  Specifically  he had in mind the trade and exchange controls  bilateral arrangements   3  of Nazi Germany and the imperial preference system practiced by Britain  by which members or former members of the British Empire were accorded special trade status  itself provoked by German  French  and American protectionist policies  Hull argued  U nhampered trade dovetailed with peace  high tariffs  trade barriers  and unfair economic competition  with war if we could get a freer flow of trade freer in the sense of fewer discriminations and obstructions so that one country would not be deadly jealous of another and the living standards of all countries might rise  thereby eliminating the economic dissatisfaction that breeds war  we might have a reasonable chance of lasting peace    4   edit  Rise of governmental intervention The developed countries also agreed that the liberal international economic system required governmental intervention  In the aftermath of the Great Depression  public management of the economy had emerged as a primary activity of governments in the developed states  citation needed  Employment  stability  and growth were now important subjects of public policy  In turn  the role of government in the national economy had become associated with the assumption by the state of the responsibility for assuring its citizens of a degree of economic well being  citation needed  The welfare state grew out of the Great Depression  which created a popular demand for governmental intervention in the economy  and out of the theoretical contributions of the Keynesian school of economics  which asserted the need for governmental intervention to counter market imperfections  citation needed  However  increased government intervention in domestic economy brought with it isolationist sentiment that had a profoundly negative effect on international economics  citation needed  The priority of national goals  independent national action in the interwar period  and the failure to perceive that those national goals could not be realized without some form of international collaboration all resulted in  beggar thy neighbor  policies such as high tariffs  competitive devaluations that contributed to the breakdown of the gold based international monetary system  domestic political instability  and international war  The lesson learned was  as the principal architect of the Bretton Woods system New Dealer Harry Dexter White put it  the absence of a high degree of economic collaboration among the leading nations will inevitably result in economic warfare that will be but the prelude and instigator of military warfare on an even vaster scale    Notes 2  To ensure economic stability and political peace  states agreed to cooperate to closely regulate the production of their individual currencies to maintain fixed exchange rates between countries with the aim of more easily facilitating international trade  citation needed  This was the foundation of the U S  vision of postwar world free trade  which also involved lowering tariffs and among other things maintaining a balance of trade via fixed exchange rates that would be favorable to the capitalist system  citation needed  Thus  the more developed market economies agreed with the U S  vision of post war international economic management  which was to be designed to create and maintain an effective international monetary system and foster the reduction of barriers to trade and capital flows  citation needed  In a sense  the new international monetary system was in fact a return to a system similar to the pre war gold standard  only using US dollars as the world s new reserve currency until the world s gold supply could be reallocated via international trade  citation needed  Thus  the new system would be devoid  initially  of governments meddling with their currency supply as they had during the years of economic turmoil preceding WWII  Instead  governments would closely police the production of their currencies and ensure that they would not artificially manipulate their price levels  citation needed  If anything  Bretton Woods was in fact a return to a time devoid of increased governmental intervention in economies and currency systems  citation needed   edit  Atlantic Charter Roosevelt and Churchill during their secret meeting of August 9   12  1941  in Newfoundland that resulted in the Atlantic Charter  which the U S  and Britain officially announced two days later  The Atlantic Charter  drafted during U S  President Franklin D  Roosevelt s August 1941 meeting with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill on a ship in the North Atlantic  was the most notable precursor to the Bretton Woods Conference  Like Woodrow Wilson before him  whose  Fourteen Points  had outlined U S  aims in the aftermath of the First World War  Roosevelt set forth a range of ambitious goals for the postwar world even before the U S  had entered the Second World War  The Atlantic Charter affirmed the right of all nations to equal access to trade and raw materials  Moreover  the charter called for freedom of the seas  a principal U S  foreign policy aim since France and Britain had first threatened U S  shipping in the 1790s   the disarmament of aggressors  and the  establishment of a wider and more permanent system of general security   As the war drew to a close  the Bretton Woods conference was the culmination of some two and a half years of planning for postwar reconstruction by the Treasuries of the U S  and the UK  U S  representatives studied with their British counterparts the reconstitution of what had been lacking between the two world wars  a system of international payments that would allow trade to be conducted without fear of sudden currency depreciation or wild fluctuations in exchange rates ailments that had nearly paralyzed world capitalism during the Great Depression  Without a strong European market for U S  goods and services  most policymakers believed  the U S  economy would be unable to sustain the prosperity it had achieved during the war  citation needed  In addition  U S  unions had only grudgingly accepted government imposed restraints on their demands during the war  but they were willing to wait no longer  particularly as inflation cut into the existing wage scales with painful force   By the end of 1945  there had already been major strikes in the automobile  electrical  and steel industries   citation needed  In early 1945 Bernard Baruch described the spirit of Bretton Woods as  if we can  stop subsidization of labor and sweated competition in the export markets   as well as prevent rebuilding of war machines   oh boy  oh boy  what long term prosperity we will have   5  The United States  c ould therefore use its position of influence to reopen and control the  rules of the  world economy  so as to give unhindered access to all nations  markets and materials   edit  Wartime devastation of Europe and East Asia United States allies economically exhausted by the war needed U S  assistance to rebuild their domestic production and to finance their international trade  indeed  they needed it to survive  citation needed  Before the war  the French and the British realized that they could no longer compete with U S  industries in an open marketplace  citation needed  During the 1930s  the British created their own economic bloc to shut out U S  goods  Churchill did not believe that he could surrender that protection after the war  so he watered down the Atlantic Charter s  free access  clause before agreeing to it  citation needed  Yet  U S  officials were determined to open their access to the British empire  The combined value of British and U S  trade was well over half of all the world s trade in goods  For the U S  to open global markets  it first had to split the British  trade  empire  While Britain had economically dominated the 19th century  U S  officials intended the second half of the 20th to be under U S  hegemony  6  A Senior Official of the Bank of England commented  One of the reasons Bretton Woods worked was that the US was clearly the most powerful country at the table and so ultimately was able to impose its will on the others  including an often dismayed Britain  At the time  one senior official at the Bank of England described the deal reached at Bretton Woods as  the greatest blow to Britain next to the war   largely because it underlined the way in which financial power had moved from the UK to the US    7  A devastated Britain had little choice  Two world wars had destroyed the country s principal industries that paid for the importation of half of the nation s food and nearly all its raw materials except coal  The British had no choice but to ask for aid  Not until the United States signed an agreement on December 6  1945 to grant Britain aid of  4 4 billion did the British Parliament ratify the Bretton Woods Agreements  which occurred later in December 1945   8  For nearly two centuries  French and U S  interests had clashed in both the Old World and the New World  citation needed  During the war  French mistrust of the United States was embodied by General Charles de Gaulle  president of the French provisional government  citation needed  De Gaulle bitterly fought U S  officials as he tried to maintain his country s colonies and diplomatic freedom of action  In turn  U S  officials saw de Gaulle as a political extremist  citation needed  But in 1945 de Gaulle at that point the leading voice of French nationalism was forced to grudgingly ask the U S  for a billion dollar loan  citation needed  Most of the request was granted  in return France promised to curtail government subsidies and currency manipulation that had given its exporters advantages in the world market  citation needed  On a far more profound level  as the Bretton Woods conference was convening  the greater part of the Third World remained politically and economically subordinate  Linked to the developed countries of the West economically and politically formally and informally these states had little choice but to acquiesce in the international economic system established for them  citation needed  In the East  Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe provided the foundation for a separate international economic system  citation needed   edit  Design of the

October 2010  Free trade relied on the free convertibility of currencies  Negotiators at the Bretton Woods conference  fresh from what they perceived as a disastrous experience with floating rates in the 1930s  concluded that major monetary fluctuations could stall the free flow of trade  The new economic system required an accepted vehicle for investment  trade  and payments  Unlike national economies  however  the international economy lacks a central government that can issue currency and manage its use  In the past this problem had been solved through the gold standard  but the architects of Bretton Woods did not consider this option feasible for the postwar political economy  Instead  they set up a system of fixed exchange rates managed by a series of newly created international institutions using the U S  dollar  which was a gold standard currency for central banks  as a reserve currency   edit  Informal regimes  edit  Previous regimes In the 19th and early 20th centuries gold played a key role in international monetary transactions  The gold standard was used to back currencies  the international value of currency was determined by its fixed relationship to gold  gold was used to settle international accounts  The gold standard maintained fixed exchange rates that were seen as desirable because they reduced the risk when trading with other countries  Imbalances in international trade were theoretically rectified automatically by the gold standard  A country with a deficit would have depleted gold reserves and would thus have to reduce its money supply  The resulting fall in demand would reduce imports and the lowering of prices would boost exports  thus the deficit would be rectified  Any country experiencing inflation would lose gold and therefore would have a decrease in the amount of money available to spend  This decrease in the amount of money would act to reduce the inflationary pressure  Supplementing the use of gold in this period was the British pound  Based on the dominant British economy  the pound became a reserve  transaction  and intervention currency  But the pound was not up to the challenge of serving as the primary world currency  given the weakness of the British economy after the Second World War  The architects of Bretton Woods had conceived of a system wherein exchange rate stability was a prime goal  Yet  in an era of more activist economic policy  governments did not seriously consider permanently fixed rates on the model of the classical gold standard of the nineteenth century  Gold production was not even sufficient to meet the demands of growing international trade and investment  And a sizeable share of the world s known gold reserves were located in the Soviet Union  which would later emerge as a Cold War rival to the United States and Western Europe  The only currency strong enough to meet the rising demands for international currency transactions was the U S  dollar  The strength of the U S  economy  the fixed relationship of the dollar to gold   35 an ounce   and the commitment of the U S  government to convert dollars into gold at that price made the dollar as good as gold  In fact  the dollar was even better than gold  it earned interest and it was more flexible than gold  Another view is that in the time of discount banks  discount was the interest earned on gold  and that the only way to repay interest on government bonds is by printing more dollars  thus raising the price of gold  If gold is fixed at  35 then other countries will demand gold and not accept dollars  The closing of the gold window in 1971 was the result   edit  Fixed exchange rates The rules of Bretton Woods  set forth in the articles of agreement of the International Monetary Fund  IMF  and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development  IBRD   provided for a system of fixed exchange rates  The rules further sought to encourage an open system by committing members to the convertibility of their respective currencies into other currencies and to free trade  What emerged was the  pegged rate  currency regime  Members were required to establish a parity of their national currencies in terms of the reserve currency  a  peg   and to maintain exchange rates within plus or minus 1  of parity  a  band   by intervening in their foreign exchange markets  that is  buying or selling foreign money   In theory  the reserve currency would be the bancor  a World Currency Unit that was never implemented   suggested by John Maynard Keynes  however  the United States objected and their request was granted  making the  reserve currency  the U S  dollar  This meant that other countries would peg their currencies to the U S  dollar  and once convertibility was restored would buy and sell U S  dollars to keep market exchange rates within plus or minus 1  of parity  Thus  the U S  dollar took over the role that gold had played under the gold standard in the international financial system  9  Meanwhile  to bolster faith in the dollar  the U S  agreed separately to link the dollar to gold at the rate of  35 per ounce of gold  At this rate  foreign governments and central banks were able to exchange dollars for gold  Bretton Woods established a system of payments based on the dollar  in which all currencies were defined in relation to the dollar  itself convertible into gold  and above all   as good as gold   The U S  currency was now effectively the world currency  the standard to which every other currency was pegged  As the world s key currency  most international transactions were denominated in US dollars  citation needed  The U S  dollar was the currency with the most purchasing power and it was the only currency that was backed by gold  Additionally  all European nations that had been involved in World War II were highly in debt and transferred large amounts of gold into the United States  a fact that contributed to the supremacy of the United States citation needed   Thus  the U S  dollar was strongly appreciated in the rest of the world and therefore became the key currency of the Bretton Woods system  Member countries could only change their par value with IMF approval  which was contingent on IMF determination that its balance of payments was in a  fundamental disequilibrium    edit  Formal regimes The Bretton Woods Conference led to the establishment of the IMF and the IBRD  now the World Bank   which still remain powerful forces in the world economy  A major point of common ground at the Conference was the goal to avoid a recurrence of the closed markets and economic warfare that had characterized the 1930s  Thus  negotiators at Bretton Woods also agreed that there was a need for an institutional forum for international cooperation on monetary matters  Already in 1944 the British economist John Maynard Keynes emphasized  the importance of rule based regimes to stabilize business expectations  something he accepted in the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates  Currency troubles in the interwar years  it was felt  had been greatly exacerbated by the absence of any established procedure or machinery for intergovernmental consultation  As a result of the establishment of agreed upon structures and rules of international economic interaction  conflict over economic issues was minimized  and the significance of the economic aspect of international relations seemed to recede   edit  International Monetary Fund Main article  International Monetary Fund Officially established on December 27  1945  when the 29 participating countries at the conference of Bretton Woods signed its Articles of Agreement  the IMF was to be the keeper of the rules and the main instrument of public international management  The Fund commenced its financial operations on March 1  1947  IMF approval was necessary for any change in exchange rates in excess of 1   It advised countries on policies affecting the monetary system   edit  Design The big question at the Bretton Woods conference with respect to the institution that would emerge as the IMF was the issue of future access to international liquidity and whether that source should be akin to a world central bank able to create new reserves at will or a more limited borrowing mechanism  John Maynard Keynes  right  and Harry Dexter White at the inaugural meeting of the International Monetary Fund s Board of Governors in Savannah  Georgia  U S   March 8  1946 Although attended by 44 nations  discussions at the conference were dominated by two rival plans developed by the United States and Britain  As the chief international economist at the U S  Treasury in 1942 44  Harry Dexter White drafted the U S  blueprint for international access to liquidity  which competed with the plan drafted for the British Treasury by Keynes  Overall  White s scheme tended to favor incentives designed to create price stability within the world s economies  while Keynes  wanted a system that encouraged economic growth  At the time  gaps between the White and Keynes plans seemed enormous  Outlining the difficulty of creating a system that every nation could accept in his speech at the closing plenary session of the Bretton Woods conference on July 22  1944  Keynes stated  We  the delegates of this Conference  Mr  President  have been trying to accomplish something very difficult to accomplish       It has been our task to find a common measure  a common standard  a common rule acceptable to each and not irksome to any    Notes 3  Keynes  proposals would have established a world reserve currency  which he thought might be called  bancor   administered by a central bank vested with the possibility of creating money and with the authority to take actions on a much larger scale  In case of balance of payments imbalances  Keynes recommended that both debtors and creditors should change their policies  As outlined by Keynes  countries with payment surpluses should increase their imports from the deficit countries and thereby create a foreign trade equilibrium  Thus  Keynes was sensitive to the problem that placing too much of the burden on the deficit country would be deflationary  But the United States  as a likely creditor nation  and eager to take on the role of the world s economic powerhouse  balked at Keynes  plan and did not pay serious attention to it  The U S  contingent was too concerned about inflationary pressures in the postwar economy  and White saw an imbalance as a problem only of the deficit country  Although compromise was reached on some points  because of the overwhelming economic and military power of the United States the participants at Bretton Woods largely agreed on White s plan   edit  Subscriptions and quotas What emerged largely reflected U S  preferences  a system of subscriptions and quotas embedded in the IMF  which itself was to be no more than a fixed pool of national currencies and gold subscribed by each country as opposed to a world central bank capable of creating money  The Fund was charged with managing various nations  trade deficits so that they would not produce currency devaluations that would trigger a decline in imports  The IMF is provided with a fund  composed of contributions of member countries in gold and their own currencies  The original quotas were to total  8 8 billion  When joining the IMF  members are assigned  quotas  reflecting their relative economic power  and  as a sort of credit deposit  are obliged to pay a  subscription  of an amount commensurate to the quota  The subscription is to be paid 25  in gold or currency convertible into gold  effectively the dollar  which was the only currency then still directly gold convertible for central banks  and 75  in the member s own currency  Quota subscriptions are to form the largest source of money at the IMF s disposal  The IMF set out to use this money to grant loans to member countries with financial difficulties  Each member is then entitled to withdraw 25  of its quota immediately in case of payment problems  If this sum should be insufficient  each nation in the system is also able to request loans for foreign currency   edit  Trade deficits In the event of a deficit in the current account  Fund members  when short of reserves  would be able to borrow foreign currency in amounts determined by the size of its quota  In other words  the higher the country s contribution was  the higher the sum of money it could borrow from the IMF  Members were required to pay back debts within a period of 18 months to five years  In turn  the IMF embarked on setting up rules and procedures to keep a country from going too deeply into debt year after year  The Fund would exercise  surveillance  over other economies for the U S  Treasury in return for its loans to prop up national currencies  IMF loans were not comparable to loans issued by a conventional credit institution  Instead  they were effectively a chance to purchase a foreign currency with gold or the member s national currency  The U S  backed IMF plan sought to end restrictions on the transfer of goods and services from one country to another  eliminate currency blocs  and lift currency exchange controls  The IMF was designed to advance credits to countries with balance of payments deficits  Short run balance of payment difficulties would be overcome by IMF loans  which would facilitate stable currency exchange rates  This flexibility meant a member state would not have to induce a depression to cut its national income down to such a low level that its imports would finally fall within its means  Thus  countries were to be spared the need to resort to the classical medicine of deflating themselves into drastic unemployment when faced with chronic balance of payments deficits  Before the Second World War  European nations particularly Britain often resorted to this   edit  Par value The IMF sought to provide for occasional discontinuous exchange rate adjustments  changing a member s par value  by international agreement  Member nations were permitted to adjust their currency exchange rate by 10   This tended to restore equilibrium in their trade by expanding their exports and contracting imports  This would be allowed only if there was a fundamental disequilibrium  A decrease in the value of a country s money was called a devaluation  while an increase in the value of the country s money was called a revaluation  It was envisioned that these changes in exchange rates would be quite rare  However  the concept of fundamental disequilibrium  though key to the operation of the par value system  was never defined in detail   edit  Operations Never before had international monetary cooperation been attempted on a permanent institutional basis  Even more groundbreaking was the decision to allocate voting rights among governments  not on a one state one vote basis  but rather in proportion to quotas  Since the United States was contributing the most  U S  leadership was the key  Under the system of weighted voting  the United States exerted a preponderant influence on the IMF  The United States held one third of all IMF quotas at the outset  enough on its own to veto all changes to the IMF Charter  In addition  the IMF was based in Washington  D C   and staffed mainly by U S  economists  It regularly exchanged personnel with the U S  Treasury  When the IMF began operations in 1946  President Harry S  Truman named White as its first U S  Executive Director  Since no Deputy Managing Director post had yet been created  White served occasionally as Acting Managing Director and generally played a highly influential role during the IMF s first year   edit  International Bank for Reconstruction and Development Main article  International Bank for Reconstruction and Development The agreement made no provisions for international creation of reserves  New gold production was assumed to be sufficient  In the event of structural disequilibria  it was expected that there would be national solutions  for example  an adjustment in the value of the currency or an improvement by other means of a country s competitive position  The IMF was left with few means  however  to encourage such national solutions  It had been recognized in 1944 that the new system could only commence after a return to normalcy following the disruption of World War II  It was expected that after a brief transition period of no more than five years  the international economy would recover and the system would enter into operation  To promote the growth of world trade and to finance the postwar reconstruction of Europe  the planners at Bretton Woods created another institution  the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development  IBRD   now the most important agency of the World Bank Group  The IBRD had an authorized capitalization of  10 billion and was expected to make loans of its own funds to underwrite private loans and to issue securities to raise new funds to make possible a speedy postwar recovery  The IBRD was to be a specialized agency of the United Nations charged with making loans for economic development purposes   edit  Readjustment  edit  Dollar shortages and the Marshall Plan The Bretton Woods arrangements were largely adhered to and ratified by the participating governments  It was expected that national monetary reserves  supplemented with necessary IMF credits  would finance any temporary balance of payments disequilibria  But this did not prove sufficient to get Europe out of its doldrums  Postwar world capitalism suffered from a huge dollar shortage  The United States was running huge balance of trade surpluses  and the U S  reserves were immense and growing  It was necessary to reverse this flow  Dollars had to leave the United States and become available for international use  In other words  the United States would have to reverse the natural economic processes and run a balance of payments deficit  The modest credit facilities of the IMF were clearly insufficient to deal with Western Europe s huge balance of payments deficits  The problem was further aggravated by the reaffirmation by the IMF Board of Governors in the provision in the Bretton Woods Articles of Agreement that the IMF could make loans only for current account deficits and not for capital and reconstruction purposes  Only the United States contribution of  570 million was actually available for IBRD lending  In addition  because the only available market for IBRD bonds was the conservative Wall Street banking market  the IBRD was forced to adopt a conservative lending policy  granting loans only when repayment was assured  Given these problems  by 1947 the IMF and the IBRD themselves were admitting that they could not deal with the international monetary system s economic problems  10  The United States set up the European Recovery Program  Marshall Plan  to provide large scale financial and economic aid for rebuilding Europe largely through grants rather than loans  This included countries belonging to the Soviet bloc  e g   Poland  In a speech at Harvard University on June 5  1947  U S  Secretary of State George Marshall stated  The breakdown of the business structure of Europe during the war was complete   Europe s requirements for the next three or four years of foreign food and other essential products  principally from the United States  are so much greater than her present ability to pay that she must have substantial help or face economic  social and political deterioration of a very grave character    Notes 4  From 1947 until 1958  the U S  deliberately encouraged an outflow of dollars  and  from 1950 on  the United States ran a balance of payments deficit with the intent of providing liquidity for the international economy  Dollars flowed out through various U S  aid programs  the Truman Doctrine entailing aid to the pro U S  Greek and Turkish regimes  which were struggling to suppress communist revolution  aid to various pro U S  regimes in the Third World  and most important  the Marshall Plan  From 1948 to 1954 the United States provided 16 Western European countries  17 billion in grants  To encourage long term adjustment  the United States promoted European and Japanese trade competitiveness  Policies for economic controls on the defeated former Axis countries were scrapped  Aid to Europe and Japan was designed to rebuild productivity and export capacity  In the long run it was expected that such European and Japanese recovery would benefit the United States by widening markets for U S  exports  and providing locations for U S  capital expansion  In 1956  the World Bank created the International Finance Corporation and in 1960 it created the International Development Association  IDA   Both have been controversial  Critics of the IDA argue that it was designed to head off a broader based system headed by the United Nations  and that the IDA lends without consideration for the effectiveness of the program citation needed   Critics also point out that the pressure to keep developing economies  open  has led to their having difficulties obtaining funds through ordinary channels  and a continual cycle of asset buy up by foreign investors and capital flight by locals citation needed   Defenders of the IDA pointed to its ability to make large loans for agricultural programs which aided the  Green Revolution  of the 1960s  and its functioning to stabilize and occasionally subsidize Third World governments  particularly in Latin America citation needed   Bretton Woods  then  created a system of triangular trade  the United States would use the convertible financial system to trade at a tremendous profit with developing nations  expanding industry and acquiring raw materials  It would use this surplus to send dollars to Europe  which would then be used to rebuild their economies  and make the United States the market for their products  This would allow the other industrialized nations to purchase products from the Third World  which reinforced the American role as the guarantor of stability  When this triangle became destabilized  Bretton Woods entered a period of crisis that ultimately led to its collapse   edit  Cold War In 1945  Roosevelt and Churchill prepared the postwar era by negotiating with Joseph Stalin at Yalta about respective zones of influence  this same year Germany was divided into four occupation zones  Soviet  American  British  and French   Roosevelt and Henry Morgenthau insisted that the Big Four  United States  United Kingdom  the Soviet Union  and China  participate in the Bretton Woods conference in 1944  11  but their goal was frustrated when the Soviet Union would not join the IMF  In the past  the reasons why the Soviet Union chose not to subscribe to the articles by December 1945 have been the subject of speculation  But since the release of relevant Soviet archives  it is now clear that the Soviet calculation was based on the behavior of the parties that had actually expressed their assent to the Bretton Woods Agreements  citation needed  The extended debates about ratification that had taken place both in the UK and the U S  were read in Moscow as evidence of the quick disintegration of the wartime alliance  citation needed  Facing the Soviet Union  whose power had also strengthened and whose territorial influence had expanded  the U S  assumed the role of leader of the capitalist camp  The rise of the postwar U S  as the world s leading industrial  monetary  and military power was rooted in the fact that the mainland U S  was untouched by the war  in the instability of the national states in postwar Europe  and the wartime devastation of the Soviet and European economies  Despite the economic effort imposed by such a policy  being at the center of the international market gave the U S  unprecedented freedom of action in pursuing its foreign affairs goals  A trade surplus made it easier to keep armies abroad and to invest outside the U S   and because other nations could not sustain foreign deployments  the U S  had the power to decide why  when and how to intervene in global crises  The dollar continued to function as a compass to guide the health of the world economy  and exporting to the U S  became the primary economic goal of developing or redeveloping economies  This arrangement came to be referred to as the Pax Americana  in analogy to the Pax Britannica of the late 19th century and the Pax Romana of the first   See Globalism   edit  Late application  edit  U S  balance of payments crisis After the end of World War II  the U S  held  26 billion in gold reserves  of an estimated total of  40 billion  approx 60    As world trade increased rapidly through the 1950s  the size of the gold base increased by only a few percentage points  In 1950  the U S  balance of payments swung negative  The first U S  response to the crisis was in the late 1950s when the Eisenhower administration placed import quotas on oil and other restrictions on trade outflows  More drastic measures were proposed  but not acted upon  However  with a mounting recession that began in 1958  this response alone was not sustainable  In 1960  with Kennedy s election  a decade long effort to maintain the Bretton Woods System at the  35 ounce price was begun  The design of the Bretton Woods System was that nations could only enforce gold convertibility on the anchor currency the United States  dollar  Gold convertibility enforcement was not required  but instead  allowed  Nations could forgo converting dollars to gold  and instead hold dollars  Rather than full convertibility  it provided a fixed price for sales between central banks  However  there was still an open gold market  For the Bretton Woods system to remain workable  it would either have to alter the peg of the dollar to gold  or it would have to maintain the free market price for gold near the  35 per ounce official price  The greater the gap between free market gold prices and central bank gold prices  the greater the temptation to deal with internal economic issues by buying gold at the Bretton Woods price and selling it on the open market  In 1960 Robert Triffin  Belgian American economist  noticed that holding dollars was more valuable than gold because constant U S  balance of payments deficits helped to keep the system liquid and fuel economic growth  What would later come to be known as Triffin s Dilemma was predicted when Triffin noted that if the U S  failed to keep running deficits the system would lose its liquidity  not be able to keep up with the world s economic growth  and  thus  bring the system to a halt  But incurring such payment deficits also meant that  over time  the deficits would erode confidence in the dollar as the reserve currency created instability  12  The first effort was the creation of the London Gold Pool on November 1 of 1961 between eight nations  The theory behind the pool was that spikes in the free market price of gold  set by the morning gold fix in London  could be controlled by having a pool of gold to sell on the open market  that would then be recovered when the price of gold dropped  Gold s price spiked in response to events such as the Cuban Missile Crisis  and other smaller events  to as high as  40 ounce  The Kennedy administration drafted a radical change of the tax system to spur more production capacity and thus encourage exports  This culminated with the 1963 tax cut program  designed to maintain the  35 peg  In 1967  there was an attack on the pound and a run on gold in the sterling area  and on November 18  1967  the British government was forced to devalue the pound  13  U S  President Lyndon Baines Johnson was faced with a brutal choice  either institute protectionist measures  including travel taxes  export subsidies and slashing the budget or accept the risk of a  run on gold  and the dollar  From Johnson s perspective   The world supply of gold is insufficient to make the present system workable particularly as the use of the dollar as a reserve currency is essential to create the required international liquidity to sustain world trade and growth   14  He believed that the priorities of the United States were correct  and  although there were internal tensions in the Western alliance  that turning away from open trade would be more costly  economically and politically  than it was worth   Our role of world leadership in a political and military sense is the only reason for our current embarrassment in an economic sense on the one hand and on the other the correction of the economic embarrassment under present monetary systems will result in an untenable position economically for our allies   citation needed  While West Germany agreed not to purchase gold from the U S   and agreed to hold dollars instead  the pressure on both the dollar and the pound sterling continued  In January 1968 Johnson imposed a series of measures designed to end gold outflow  and to increase U S  exports  This was unsuccessful  however  as in mid March 1968 a run on gold ensued  the London Gold Pool was dissolved  and a series of meetings attempted to rescue or reform the existing system  15  But  as long as the U S  commitments to foreign deployment continued  particularly to Western Europe  there was little that could be done to maintain the gold peg  citation needed  original research   All attempts to maintain the peg collapsed in November 1968  and a new policy program attempted to convert the Bretton Woods system into an enforcement mechanism of floating the gold peg  which would be set by either fiat policy or by a restriction to honor foreign accounts  The collapse of the gold pool and the refusal of the pool members to trade gold with private entities on March 18  1968 the Congress of the United States repealed the 25  requirement of gold backing of the dollar 16  as well as the US pledge to suspend gold sales to governments that trade in the private markets  17  led to the expansion of the private markets for international gold trade  in which the price of gold rose much higher than the official dollar price  18  19  The US gold reserves continued to be depleted due to the actions of some nations  notably France  19  who continued to build up their gold reserves   edit  Structural changes  edit  Return to convertibility In the 1960s and 70s  important structural changes eventually led to the breakdown of international monetary management  One change was the development of a high level of monetary interdependence  The stage was set for monetary interdependence by the return to convertibility of the Western European currencies at the end of 1958 and of the Japanese yen in 1964  Convertibility facilitated the vast expansion of international financial transactions  which deepened monetary interdependence   edit  Growth of international currency markets Another aspect of the internationalization of banking has been the emergence of international banking consortia  Since 1964 various banks had formed international syndicates  and by 1971 over three quarters of the world s largest banks had become shareholders in such syndicates  Multinational banks can and do make huge international transfers of capital not only for investment purposes but also for hedging and speculating against exchange rate fluctuations  These new forms of monetary interdependence made possible huge capital flows  During the Bretton Woods era countries were reluctant to alter exchange rates formally even in cases of structural disequilibria  Because such changes had a direct impact on certain domestic economic groups  they came to be seen as political risks for leaders  As a result official exchange rates often became unrealistic in market terms  providing a virtually risk free temptation for speculators  They could move from a weak to a strong currency hoping to reap profits when a revaluation occurred  If  however  monetary authorities managed to avoid revaluation  they could return to other currencies with no loss  The combination of risk free speculation with the availability of huge sums was highly destabilizing   edit  Decline  edit  U S  monetary influence A second structural change that undermined monetary management was the decline of U S  hegemony  The U S  was no longer the dominant economic power it had been for more than two decades  By the mid 1960s  the E E C  and Japan had become international economic powers in their own right  With total reserves exceeding those of the U S   with higher levels of growth and trade  and with per capita income approaching that of the U S   Europe and Japan were narrowing the gap between themselves and the United States  The shift toward a more pluralistic distribution of economic power led to increasing dissatisfaction with the privileged role of the U S  dollar as the international currency  As in effect the world s central banker  the U S   through its deficit  determined the level of international liquidity  In an increasingly interdependent world  U S  policy greatly influenced economic conditions in Europe and Japan  In addition  as long as other countries were willing to hold dollars  the U S  could carry out massive foreign expenditures for political purposes military activities and foreign aid without the threat of balance of payments constraints  Dissatisfaction with the political implications of the dollar system was increased by d tente between the U S  and the Soviet Union  The Soviet threat had been an important force in cementing the Western capitalist monetary system  The U S  political and security umbrella helped make American economic domination palatable for Europe and Japan  which had been economically exhausted by the war  As gross domestic production grew in European countries  trade grew  When common security tensions lessened  this loosened the transatlantic dependence on defence concerns  and allowed latent economic tensions to surface   edit  Dollar Reinforcing the relative decline in U S  power and the dissatisfaction of Europe and Japan with the system was the continuing decline of the dollar the foundation that had underpinned the post 1945 global trading system  The Vietnam War and the refusal of the administration of U S  President Lyndon B  Johnson to pay for it and its Great Society programs through taxation resulted in an increased dollar outflow to pay for the military expenditures and rampant inflation  which led to the deterioration of the U S  balance of trade position  citation needed  In the late 1960s  the dollar was overvalued with its current trading position  while the Deutsche Mark and the yen were undervalued  and  naturally  the Germans and the Japanese had no desire to revalue and thereby make their exports more expensive  whereas the U S  sought to maintain its international credibility by avoiding devaluation  20  Meanwhile  the pressure on government reserves was intensified by the new international currency markets  with their vast pools of speculative capital moving around in search of quick profits  19  In contrast  upon the creation of Bretton Woods  with the U S  producing half of the world s manufactured goods and holding half its reserves  the twin burdens of international management and the Cold War were possible to meet at first  Throughout the 1950s Washington sustained a balance of payments deficit to finance loans  aid  and troops for allied regimes  But during the 1960s the costs of doing so became less tolerable  By 1970 the U S  held under 16  of international reserves  Adjustment to these changed realities was impeded by the U S  commitment to fixed exchange rates and by the U S  obligation to convert dollars into gold on demand  citation needed   edit  Paralysis of international monetary management  edit  Floating rate system during 1968 1972 By 1968  the attempt to defend the dollar at a fixed peg of  35 ounce  the policy of the Eisenhower  Kennedy and Johnson administrations  had become increasingly untenable  Gold outflows from the U S  accelerated  and despite gaining assurances from Germany and other nations to hold gold  the unbalanced fiscal spending of the Johnson administration had transformed the dollar shortage of the 1940s and 1950s into a dollar glut by the 1960s  In 1967  the IMF agreed in Rio de Janeiro to replace the tranche division set up in 1946  Special drawing rights  SDRs  were set as equal to one U S  dollar  but were not usable for transactions other than between banks and the IMF  Nations were required to accept holding SDRs equal to three times their allotment  and interest would be charged  or credited  to each nation based on their SDR holding  The original interest rate was 1 5   The intent of the SDR system was to prevent nations from buying pegged gold and selling it at the higher free market price  and give nations a reason to hold dollars by crediting interest  at the same time setting a clear limit to the amount of dollars that could be held  The essential conflict was that the American role as military defender of the capitalist world s economic system was recognized  but not given a specific monetary value  In effect  other nations  purchased  American defense policy by taking a loss in holding dollars  They were only willing to do this as long as they supported U S  military policy  Because of the Vietnam War and other unpopular actions  the pro U S  consensus began to evaporate  The SDR agreement  in effect  monetized the value of this relationship  but did not create a market for it  The use of SDRs as paper gold seemed to offer a way to balance the system  turning the IMF  rather than the U S   into the world s central banker  The U S  tightened controls over foreign investment and currency  including mandatory investment controls in 1968  In 1970  U S  President Richard Nixon lifted import quotas on oil in an attempt to reduce energy costs  instead  however  this exacerbated dollar flight  and created pressure from petro dollars  Still  the U S  continued to draw down reserves  In 1971 it had a reserve deficit of  56 billion  as well  it had depleted most of its non gold reserves and had only 22  gold coverage of foreign reserves  In short  the dollar was tremendously overvalued with respect to gold   edit  Nixon Shock Main article  Nixon Shock By the early 1970s  as the Vietnam War accelerated inflation  the United States as a whole began running a trade deficit  The crucial turning point was 1970  which saw U S  gold coverage deteriorate from 55  to 22   This  in the view of neoclassical economists  represented the point where holders of the dollar had lost faith in the ability of the U S  to cut budget and trade deficits  In 1971 more and more dollars were being printed in Washington  then being pumped overseas  to pay for government expenditure on the military and social programs  In the first six months of 1971  assets for  22 billion fled the U S  In response  on August 15  1971  Nixon unilaterally imposed 90 day wage and price controls  a 10  import surcharge  and most importantly  closed the gold window   making the dollar inconvertible to gold directly  except on the open market  Unusually  this decision was made without consulting members of the international monetary system or even his own State Department  and was soon dubbed the Nixon Shock  The surcharge was dropped in December 1971 as part of a general revaluation of major currencies  which were henceforth allowed 2 25  devaluations from the agreed exchange rate  But even the more flexible official rates could not be defended against the speculators  By March 1976  all the major currencies were floating in other words  exchange rates were no longer the principal method used by governments to administer monetary policy   edit  Smithsonian Agreement The shock of August 15 was followed by efforts under U S  leadership to develop a new system of international monetary management  Throughout the fall of 1971  there was a series of multilateral and bilateral negotiations of the Group of Ten seeking to develop a new multilateral monetary system  On December 17 and 18  1971  the Group of Ten  meeting in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington  created the Smithsonian Agreement  which devalued the dollar to  38 ounce  with 2 25  trading bands  and attempted to balance the world financial system using SDRs alone  It was criticized at the time  and was by design a  temporary  agreement  It failed to impose discipline on the U S  government  and with no other credibility mechanism in place  the pressure against the dollar in gold continued  This resulted in gold becoming a floating asset  and in 1971 it reached  44 20 ounce  in 1972  70 30 ounce and still climbing  By 1972  currencies began abandoning even this devalued peg against the dollar  though it took a decade for all of the industrialized nations to do so  In February 1973 the Bretton Woods currency exchange markets closed  after a last gasp devaluation of the dollar to  44 ounce  and reopened in March in a floating currency regime   edit  Bretton Woods II Main article  Bretton Woods II Dooley  Folkerts Landau and Garber have referred to the monetary system of today as Bretton Woods II  21  They argue that in the early 2000s  like 40 years earlier  the international system is composed of a core issuing the dominant international currency  and a periphery  The periphery is committed to export led growth based on the maintenance of an undervalued exchange rate  In the 1960s  the core was the United States and the periphery was Europe and Japan  This old periphery has since graduated  and the new periphery is Asia  The core remains the same  the United States  The argument is that a system of pegged currencies  in which the periphery export capital to the core that provides a financial intermediary role is both stable and desirable  although this notion is controversial  21  The term dollar hegemony was populised by Henry C K  Liu to describe the hegemonic role of the US dollar in the globalized economy   22   edit  The Bretton Woods system after the 2008 crisis In the wake of the Global financial crisis of 2008  policymakers and others have called for a new international monetary system that some of them also dub Bretton Woods II  On the other side  this crisis has revived the debate about Bretton Woods II  Notes 5  On September 26  2008  French president  Nicolas Sarkozy  said   we must rethink the financial system from scratch  as at Bretton Woods   23  On September 24 25  2009 US President Obama hosted the G20 in Pittsburgh  A realignment of currency exchange rates was proposed  This meeting s policy outcome could be known as the Pittsburgh Agreement of 2009  where deficit nations may devalue their currencies and surplus nations may revalue theirs upward  In March 2010  Prime Minister Papandreou of Greece wrote an op ed in the International Herald Tribune  in which he said   Democratic governments worldwide must establish a new global financial architecture  as bold in its own way as Bretton Woods  as bold as the creation of the European Community and European Monetary Union  And we need it fast   In interviews coinciding with his meeting with President Obama  he indicated that Obama would raise the issue of new regulations for the international financial markets at the next G20 meetings in June and November 2010  Over the course of the crisis the IMF progressively relaxed its stance on  free market  principles such as its guidance against using capital controls  In 2011 the IMF s managing director Dominique Strauss Kahn stated that boosting employment and equity  must be placed at the heart  of the IMF s policy agenda   24  The World Bank also indicated a switch towards greater emphases on job creation  25  26   edit  Academic legacy The collapse of the Bretton Woods system led to the study in economics of credibility as a distinct field  and to the prominence of open macroeconomic models  such as the Mundell Fleming model  citation needed   edit  Pegged rates Dates shown are
