University  Sanderson s first involvement in the field was as a  letterhack   a frequent contributor to comic book letter columns  His missives impressed DC Comics editor Julius Schwartz enough for Schwartz expand the letter columns in some titles to a second  separate page  such as  Flash Grams   Extra    Letters To the Batcave   Extra   and  JLA Mailroom   Special Peter Sanderson Edition   to facilitate Sanderson s analysis  3  In the early 1980s Sanderson wrote for comic fanzines  From there  Sanderson broke into the comic book industry proper  he was first hired by DC Comics  where he

Universe series in the 1980s and early 1990s  Sanderson was also the writer of the Marvel Saga and Wolverine Saga limited series  These titles did not follow the typical art centered comic book format  instead  the two series focused on text chronicling the fictional histories of comic book characters   rather than writing new exploits of the characters   that Sanderson culled from previous titles Marvel had published over the years  The text was supplemented by individual panels excerpted from the comic books that served as Sanderson s sources  He writes an online column entitled Comics in Context  which  in Sanderson s own words  is  a weekly series of critical essays on comics  cartoon art  and related subjects   6   those  related subjects  can run the gamut from film adaptations of comic books  to other media that have been influenced by comics  such as Star Wars   The series started on July 8  2003 on the website IGN com  but then moved to the Kevin Smith affiliated website Quick Stop Entertainment on June 23  2006  according to Mr  Sanderson  the  Powers That Be  in charge of IGN s comics section began to tamper with the titles of his columns and complain about some of the topics he covered  whereby a  change of scenery  was necessary  6  After a seventeen month hiatus  Comics in Context returned to the newly rebranded A Site Called Fred on January 19  2010  7  Outside of his online writings  Sanderson has also had a number of books published  including The Marvel Vault and The Marvel Travel Guide to New York   8  taught the class The Graphic Novel as
