drawings   The word first came into common usage in the late 18th century with the publication of such works as Sant  Ky den s picturebook Shiji no yukikai  1798   and in the early 19th century with such works as Aikawa Minwa s Manga hyakujo  1814  and the celebrated Hokusai Manga books  1814 1834  containing assorted drawings from the sketchbooks of the famous ukiyo e artist Hokusai  16 Rakuten Kitazawa  1876 1955  first used the word  manga  in the modern sense  17   edit  History and characteristics Main article  History of manga Historians and writers on manga history have described two broad and complementary processes shaping modern manga  Their views differ in the relative importance they attribute to the role of cultural and historical events following World War II versus the role of pre War  Meiji  and pre Meiji Japanese culture and art  One view emphasizes events occurring during and after the U S  Occupation of Japan  1945 1952   and stresses that manga strongly reflect U S  cultural influences  including U S  comics  brought to Japan by the GIs  and images and themes from U S  television  film  and cartoons  especially Disney   18  Alternately  other writers such as Frederik L  Schodt  Kinko Ito  and Adam L  Kern stress continuity of Japanese cultural and aesthetic traditions as central to the history of manga  19  Modern manga originated in the Occupation  1945 1952  and post Occupation years  1952 early 1960s   while a previously militaristic and ultra nationalist Japan rebuilt its political and economic infrastructure  An explosion of artistic creativity occurred in this period  20  involving manga artists such as Osamu Tezuka  Astro Boy  and Machiko Hasegawa  Sazae san   A kami shibai story teller from Sazae san by Machiko Hasegawa  Sazae appears with her hair in a bun  Astro Boy quickly became  and remains  immensely popular in Japan and elsewhere  21  and the anime adaptation of Sazae san continues to run as of 2011 update   regularly drawing more viewers than any other anime on Japanese television  Tezuka and Hasegawa both made stylistic innovations  In Tezuka s  cinematographic  technique  the panels are like a motion picture that reveals details of action bordering on slow motion as well as rapid zooms from distance to close up shots  This kind of visual dynamism was widely adopted by later manga artists  22  Hasegawa s focus on daily life and on women s experience also came to characterize later sh jo manga  23  Between 1950 and 1969  an increasingly large readership for manga emerged in Japan with the solidification of its two main marketing genres  sh nen manga aimed at boys and sh jo manga aimed at girls  24  In 1969 a group of female manga artists  later called the Year 24 Group  also known as Magnificent 24s  made their sh jo manga debut   year 24  comes from the Japanese name for the year 1949  the birth year of many of these artists   25  The group included Hagio Moto  Riyoko Ikeda  Yumiko Oshima  Keiko Takemiya  and Ryoko Yamagishi  and they marked the first major entry of female artists into manga  9  Thereafter  primarily female manga artists would draw sh jo for a readership of girls and young women  26  In the following decades  1975 present   sh jo manga continued to develop stylistically while simultaneously evolving different but overlapping subgenres  27  Major subgenres include romance  superheroines  and  Ladies Comics   in Japanese  redisu        redikomi        and josei      28  Modern sh jo manga romance features love as a major theme set into emotionally intense narratives of self realization  29  With the superheroines  sh jo manga saw releases such as Pink Hanamori s Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch Reiko Yoshida s Tokyo Mew Mew  And  Naoko Takeuchi s Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon  which became internationally popular in both manga and anime formats  30  Groups  or sentais  of girls working together have also been popular within this genre  Like Lucia  Hanon  and Rina singing together  and Sailor Moon  Sailor Mercury  Sailor Mars  Sailor Jupiter  and Sailor Venus working together  31  Manga for male readers sub divides according to the age of its intended readership  boys up to 18 years old  sh nen manga  and young men 18  to 30 years old  seinen manga   32  as well as by content  including action adventure often involving male heroes  slapstick humor  themes of honor  and sometimes explicit sexuality  33  The Japanese use different kanji for two closely allied meanings of  seinen     for  youth  young man  and    for  adult  majority  the second referring to sexually overt manga aimed at grown men and also called seijin   adult      manga  34 Sh nen  seinen  and seijin manga share many features in common  Boys and young men became some of the earliest readers of manga after World War II  From the 1950s on  sh nen manga focused on topics thought to interest the archetypal boy  including subjects like robots  space travel  and heroic action adventure  35  Popular themes include science fiction  technology  sports  and supernatural settings  Manga with solitary costumed superheroes like Superman  Batman  and Spider Man generally did not become as popular  36  The role of girls and women in manga produced for male readers has evolved considerably over time to include those featuring single pretty girls  bish jo  37  such as Belldandy from Oh My Goddess   stories where such girls and women surround the hero  as in Negima and Hanaukyo Maid Team  or groups of heavily armed female warriors  sent  bish jo  38  With the relaxation of censorship in Japan in the 1990s  a wide variety of explicit sexual themes appeared in manga intended for male readers  and correspondingly occur in English translations  39  However  in 2010 the Tokyo Metropolitan Government passed a bill to restrict harmful content  1  The gekiga style of drawing emotionally dark  often starkly realistic  sometimes very violent focuses on the day in  day out grim realities of life  often drawn in gritty and unpretty fashions  40 Gekiga such as Sampei Shirato s 1959 1962 Chronicles of a Ninja s Military Accomplishments  Ninja Bugeich   arose in the late 1950s and 1960s partly from left wing student and working class political activism 41  and partly from the aesthetic dissatisfaction of young manga artists like Yoshihiro Tatsumi with existing manga  42   edit  Publications In Japan  manga constituted an annual 406 billion yen  approximately  3 6 billion USD  publication industry by 2007  43  Recently  the manga industry has expanded worldwide  where distribution companies license and reprint manga into their native languages  After a series has run for a while  publishers often collect the stories together and print them in dedicated book sized volumes  called tank bon  These are the equivalent of U S  trade paperbacks or graphic novels  These volumes use higher quality paper  and are useful to those who want to  catch up  with a series so they can follow it in the magazines or if they find the cost of the weeklies or monthlies to be prohibitive  Recently   deluxe  versions have also been printed as readers have gotten older and the need for something special grew  Old manga have also been reprinted using somewhat lesser quality paper and sold for 100 yen  about  1 U S  dollar  each to compete with the used book market  Marketeers primarily classify manga by the age and gender of the target readership  44  In particular  books and magazines sold to boys  sh nen  and girls  sh jo  have distinctive cover art and are placed on different shelves in most bookstores  Due to cross readership  consumer response is not limited by demographics  For example  male readers subscribing to a series intended for girls and so on  Japan also has manga caf s  or manga kissa  kissa is an abbreviation of kissaten   At a manga kissa  people drink coffee and read manga  and sometimes stay there overnight  There has been an increase in the amount of publications of original webmanga  It is internationally drawn by enthusiasts of all levels of experience  and is intended for online viewing  It can be ordered in graphic novel form if available in print  The Kyoto International Manga Museum maintains a very large website listing manga published in Japanese  45   edit  Magazines See also  List of manga magazines Eshinbun Nipponchi  credited as the first manga magazine ever made  Manga magazines usually have many series running concurrently with approximately 20 40 pages allocated to each series per issue  Other magazines such as the anime fandom magazine Newtype featured single chapters within their monthly periodicals  Other magazines like Nakayoshi feature many stories written by many different artists  these magazines  or  anthology magazines   as they are also known  colloquially  phone books    are usually printed on low quality newsprint and can be anywhere from 200 to more than 850 pages thick  Manga magazines also contain one shot comics and various four panel yonkoma  equivalent to comic strips   Manga series can run for many years if they are successful  Manga artists sometimes start out with a few  one shot  manga projects just to try to get their name out  If these are successful and receive good reviews  they are continued  Magazines often have a short life  46   edit  History Kanagaki Robun and Kawanabe Kyosai created the first manga magazine in 1874  Eshinbun Nipponchi  The magazine was heavily influenced by Japan Punch  founded in 1862 by Charles Wirgman  a British cartoonist  Eshinbun Nipponchi had a very simple style of drawings and did not become popular with many people  Eshinbun Nipponchi ended after three issues  The magazine Kisho Shimbun in 1875 was inspired by Eshinbun Nipponchi  which was followed by Marumaru Chinbun in 1877  and then Garakuta Chinpo in 1879  47 Sh nen Sekai was the first sh nen magazine created in 1895 by Iwaya Sazanami  a famous writer of Japanese children s literature back then  Sh nen Sekai had a strong focus on the First Sino Japanese War  48  In 1905 the manga magazine publishing boom started with the Russo Japanese War  49 Tokyo Pakku was created and became a huge hit  50  After Tokyo Pakku in 1905  a female version of Sh nen Sekai was created and named Sh jo Sekai  considered the first sh jo magazine  51 Sh nen Pakku was made and is considered the first children s manga magazine  The children s demographic was in an early stage of development in the Meiji period  Sh nen Pakku was influenced from foreign children s magazines such as Puck which an employee of Jitsugy  no Nihon  publisher of the magazine  saw and decided to emulate  In 1924  Kodomo Pakku was launched as another children s manga magazine after Sh nen Pakku  50  During the boom  Poten  derived from the French  potin   was published in 1908  All the pages were in full color with influences from Tokyo Pakku and Osaka Pakku  It is unknown if there were any more issues besides the first one  49 Kodomo Pakku was launched May 1924 by Tokyosha and featured high quality art by many members of the manga artistry like Takei Takeo  Takehisa Yumeji and Aso Yutaka  Some of the manga featured speech balloons  where other manga from the previous eras did not use speech balloons and were silent  50  Published from May 1935 to January 1941  Manga no Kuni coincided with the period of the Second Sino Japanese War  Manga no Kuni featured information on becoming a mangaka and on other comics industries around the world  Manga no Kuni handed its title to Sashie Manga Kenky  in August 1940  52   edit  D jinshi Main article  D jinshi D jinshi  produced by small publishers outside of the mainstream commercial market  resemble in their publishing small press independently published comic books in the United States  Comiket  the largest comic book convention in the world with around 500 000 visitors gathering over three days  is devoted to d jinshi  While they most often contain original stories  many are parodies of or include characters from popular manga and anime series  Some d jinshi continue with a series  story or write an entirely new one using its characters  much like fan fiction  In 2007  d jinshi sold for 27 73 billion yen  245 million USD   43   edit  International markets Main article  Manga outside Japan As of 2007 update  the influence of manga on international comics had grown considerably over the past two decades  53   Influence  is used here to refer to effects on the comics markets outside of Japan and to aesthetic effects on comics artists internationally  The reading direction in a traditional manga Traditionally  manga stories flow from top to bottom and from right to left  Some publishers of translated manga keep to this original format  Other publishers mirror the pages horizontally before printing the translation  changing the reading direction to a more  Western  left to right  so as not to confuse foreign readers or traditional comics consumers  This practice is known as  flipping   54  For the most part  criticism suggests that flipping goes against the original intentions of the creator  for example  if a person wears a shirt that reads  MAY  on it  and gets flipped  then the word is altered to  YAM    who may be ignorant of how awkward is to read comics when the eyes must flow through the pages and text in opposite directions  resulting in an experience that s quite distinct from reading something that flows homogeneously  Flipping may also cause oddities with familiar asymmetrical objects or layouts  such as a car being depicted with the gas pedal on the left and the brake on the right  or a shirt with the buttons on the wrong side  but these issues are minor when compared to the unnatural reading flow  and some of them could be solved with an adaptation work that goes beyond just translation and blind flipping  55   edit  United States Manga made their way only gradually into U S  markets  first in association with anime and then independently  56  Some U S  fans became aware of manga in the 1970s and early 1980s  57  However  anime was initially more accessible than manga to U S  fans  58  many of whom were college age young people who found it easier to obtain  subtitle  and exhibit video tapes of anime than translate  reproduce  and distribute tank bon style manga books  59  One of the first manga translated into English and marketed in the U S  was Keiji Nakazawa s Barefoot Gen  an autobiographical story of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima issued by Leonard Rifas and Educomics  1980 1982   60  More manga were translated between the mid 1980s and 1990s  including Golgo 13 in 1986  Lone Wolf and Cub from First Comics in 1987  and Kamui  Area 88  and Mai the Psychic Girl  also in 1987 and all from Viz Media Eclipse Comics  61  Others soon followed  including Akira from Marvel Comics  Epic Comics imprint and Appleseed from Eclipse Comics in 1988  and later Iczer 1  Antarctic Press  1994  and Ippongi Bang s F 111 Bandit  Antarctic Press  1995   In the 1980s to the mid 1990s  Japanese animation  like Akira  Dragon Ball  Neon Genesis Evangelion  and Pok mon  made a bigger impact on the fan experience and in the market than manga  62  Matters changed when translator entrepreneur Toren Smith founded Studio Proteus in 1986  Smith and Studio Proteus acted as an agent and translator of many Japanese manga  including Masamune Shirow s Appleseed and K suke Fujishima s Oh My Goddess   for Dark Horse and Eros Comix  eliminating the need for these publishers to seek their own contacts in Japan  63  Simultaneously  the Japanese publisher Shogakukan opened a U S  market initiative with their U S  subsidiary Viz  enabling Viz to draw directly on Shogakukan s catalogue and translation skills  54  A young boy reading Black Cat in a Barnes  amp  Noble bookstore Japanese publishers began pursuing a U S  market in the mid 1990s due to a stagnation in the domestic market for manga  64  The U S  manga market took an upturn with mid 1990s anime and manga versions of Masamune Shirow s Ghost in the Shell  translated by Frederik L  Schodt and Toren Smith  becoming very popular among fans  65  Another success of the mid 1990s was Sailor Moon  66  By 1995 1998  the Sailor Moon manga had been exported to over 23 countries  including China  Brazil  Mexico  Australia  North America and most of Europe  67  In 1997  Mixx Entertainment began publishing Sailor Moon  along with CLAMP s Magic Knight Rayearth  Hitoshi Iwaaki s Parasyte and Tsutomu Takahashi s Ice Blade in the monthly manga magazine MixxZine  Two years later  MixxZine was renamed to Tokyopop before discontinuing in 2000  Mixx Entertainment  later renamed Tokyopop  also published manga in trade paperbacks and  like Viz  began aggressive marketing of manga to both young male and young female demographics  68  In the following years  manga became increasingly popular  and new publishers entered the field while the established publishers greatly expanded their catalogues  69  As of 2008 update   the U S  and Canadian manga market generated  175 million in annual sales  70  Simultaneously  mainstream U S  media began to discuss manga  with articles in The New York Times  Time magazine  The Wall Street Journal  and Wired magazine  71   edit  Europe Manga has influenced European cartooning in a way somewhat different from the U S  experience  Broadcast anime in Italy and France opened the European market to manga during the 1970s  72  French art has borrowed from Japan since the 19th century  Japonisme   73  and has its own highly developed tradition of bande dessin e cartooning  74  In France  beginning in the mid 1990s  75  manga has proven very popular to a wide readership  accounting for about one third of comics sales in France since 2004  76  According to the Japan External Trade Organization  sales of manga reached  212 6 million within France and Germany alone in 2006  72  France represents about 50  of the European market  77  European publishers marketing manga translated into French include Gl nat  Asuka  Casterman  Kana  and Pika  dition  among others  European publishers also translate manga into German  Italian  Dutch  and other languages  As of 2007  about 70  of all comics sold in Germany are manga  78  Manga publishers based in the United Kingdom include Gollancz and Titan Books  Manga publishers from the United States have a strong marketing presence in the United Kingdom  for example  the Tanoshimi line from Random House   edit  Localized manga A number of artists in the United States have drawn comics and cartoons influenced by manga  As an early example  Vernon Grant drew manga influenced comics while living in Japan in the late 1960s and early 1970s  79  Others include Frank Miller s mid 1980s Ronin  Adam Warren and Toren Smith s 1988 The Dirty Pair  80 Ben Dunn s 1987 Ninja High School  Stan Sakai s 1984 Usagi Yojimbo  and Manga Shi 2000 from Crusade Comics  1997   By the 21st century several U S  manga publishers had begun to produce work by U S  artists under the broad marketing label of manga  81  In 2002  I C  Entertainment  formerly Studio Ironcat and now out of business  launched a series of manga by U S  artists called Amerimanga  82  In 2004 eigoMANGA launched Rumble Pak and Sakura Pakk anthology series  Seven Seas Entertainment followed suit with World Manga  83  Simultaneously  TokyoPop introduced original English language manga  OEL manga  later renamed Global Manga  84  TokyoPop is currently the largest U S  publisher of original English language manga  85  Francophone artists have also developed their own versions of manga  like Fr d ric Boilet s la nouvelle manga  Boilet has worked in France and in Japan  sometimes collaborating with Japanese artists  86   edit  Awards The Japanese manga industry grants a large number of awards  mostly sponsored by publishers  with the winning prize usually including publication of the winning stories in magazines released by the sponsoring publisher
