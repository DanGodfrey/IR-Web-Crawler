immigrant from Laupheim who settled in Oshkosh  Wisconsin  where he managed a clothing store  On a buying trip in 1905 to Chicago  he was struck by the popularity of nickelodeons  One story has Laemmle watching a box office for hours  counting patrons and calculating the day s take  Within weeks of his Chicago trip  Laemmle gave up dry goods to buy the first of several nickelodeons  For Laemmle and other such entrepreneurs  the creation in 1908 of the Edison backed Motion Picture Trust meant that exhibitors were expected to pay fees for Trust produced films they showed  Based on Edison s patent for the electric motor used in cameras and projectors  along with other patents  the Trust collected fees on all aspects of movie production and exhibition  and attempted to enforce a monopoly on distribution  It was believed that the productions were meant to be used for another company but the firm turned Universal down  Soon Laemmle and other disgruntled nickelodeon owners decided to avoid paying Edison by producing their own pictures  In June 1911  Laemmle started the Yankee Film Company with partners Abe and Julius Stern  That company quickly evolved into the Independent Moving Pictures Company  IMP   Laemmle broke with Edison s custom of refusing to give billing and screen credits to performers  By naming the movie stars  he attracted many of the leading players of the time  contributing to the creation of the star system  In 1910  he promoted Florence Lawrence  formerly known as  The Biograph Girl   and actor King Baggot  in what may be the first instance of a studio using stars in its marketing  The Universal Film Manufacturing Company was incorporated April 30  1912 in New York  Laemmle  who emerged as president in July 1912  was the primary figure in a partnership that included Mark Dintenfass  Charles Baumann  Adam Kessel  and Pat Powers  Eventually all would be bought out by Laemmle  Baumann and Kessel later partnered with Mack Sennett for their highly successful Keystone Film Company  The new Universal studio was a horizontally integrated company  with movie production and distribution capacity  the company lacked a major circuit of exhibition venues  ownership of which would become a central element of film industry integration in the following decade   The company was incorporated as Universal Pictures Company  Inc  in 1925  Following the westward trend of the industry  by the end of 1912 the company was focusing its production efforts in the Hollywood area  Its first logo was an Earth with a Saturn like ring and the text in a bold Kentucky typeface  In 1963  this logo was revamped with mattes and animated models  In 1990  it was replaced by a filmed 3D model  which was first created to celebrate 75 years  In 1997  another logo  which uses CGI animation  was introduced  Fifteen years later  in 2012  another CGI animated logo was created  this time  to celebrate the company s 100th Anniversary  In 1915  Laemmle opened the world s largest motion picture production facility  Universal City Studios  on a 230 acre  0 9 km   converted farm just over the Cahuenga Pass from Hollywood  Studio management became the third facet of Universal s operations  with the studio incorporated as a distinct subsidiary organization  Unlike other movie moguls  Laemmle opened his studio to tourists  Universal became the biggest studio in Hollywood  and remained so for a decade  However  it sought an audience mostly in small towns  producing mostly inexpensive melodramas  westerns and serials  Despite Laemmle s role as an innovator  he was an extremely cautious studio chief  Unlike rivals Adolph Zukor  William Fox  and Marcus Loew  Laemmle chose not to develop a theater chain  He also financed all of his own films  refusing to take on debt  This policy nearly bankrupted the studio when actor director Erich von Stroheim insisted on excessively lavish production values for his films Foolish Wives and Blind Husbands  but Universal shrewdly got some of its money back by launching a sensational ad campaign that attracted moviegoers  Character actor Lon Chaney became a huge drawing card for Universal in the 1920s  appearing steadily in dramas  His two biggest hits for Universal were The Hunchback of Notre Dame  1923  and The Phantom of the Opera  1925   During this period Laemmle entrusted most of the production policy decisions to Irving Thalberg  Thalberg had been Laemmle s personal secretary  and Laemmle was impressed by Thalberg s cogent observations of how efficiently the studio could be operated  Promoted to studio chief  Thalberg was giving Universal s product a touch of class  something it seldom had during the silent era  Louis B  Mayer lured Thalberg away from Universal with a promise of better pay  Without his guidance Universal became a second tier studio  and would remain so for several decades  In 1926  Universal opened a production unit in Germany  Deutsche Universal Film AG  under the direction of Joe Pasternak  This unit produced three to four films per year until 1936  migrating to Hungary and then Austria in the face of Hitler s increasing domination of central Europe  With the advent of sound  these productions were made in the German language or  occasionally  Hungarian or Polish  In the U S   Universal Pictures did not distribute any of this subsidiary s films  but at least some of them were exhibited through other  independent  foreign language film distributors based in New York  without benefit of English subtitles  Nazi persecution and a change in ownership for the parent Universal Pictures organization resulted in the dissolution of this subsidiary  In the early years  Universal had a  clean picture  policy  However  by April 1927  Carl Laemmle considered this to be a mistake as  unclean pictures  from other studios were generating more profit while Universal was losing money  5   edit   Oswald  fallout gives rise to  Mickey Mouse  and Disney Contentious business dealings involving Universal over the drawing of a cartoon character may have affected the course of animation history  citation needed  Although Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks had created the  Oswald the Lucky Rabbit  character  which had enjoyed a successful theatrical run  Universal   and not Disney   owned the rights to it  This gave Mintz leverage in demanding that Disney accept a lower fee for producing the property or he would produce the films with his own group of animators  In the end  Disney refused the offer  As an alternative  he and Iwerks created what became Disney s flagship trademark  Mickey Mouse  which contained some of Oswald s features and soared to popularity following the duo s producing of its first talking short  Steamboat Willie  This moment effectively launched Walt Disney Studios  foothold  while Universal became a minor player in film animation after Oswald  Universal cut its ties with Mintz and formed its own in house animation studio to produce Oswald cartoons headed by Walter Lantz  In 2006  after almost 80 years  NBC Universal sold all Walt Disney produced Oswald cartoons back to Disney  In return  Disney released ABC sportscaster Al Michaels from his contract so he could work on NBC s Sunday night NFL football package  However  Universal kept the Oswald cartoons that Walter Lantz produced for them from 1929 to the mid 1930s   edit  Keeping leadership of the studio in the family In 1928  Laemmle  Sr  made his son  Carl  Jr  head of Universal Pictures as a 21st birthday present  Universal already had a reputation for nepotism at one time  70 of Carl  Sr  s relatives were supposedly on the payroll  Many of them were nephews  resulting in Carl  Sr  being known around the studios as  Uncle Carl   Ogden Nash famously quipped in rhyme   Uncle Carl Laemmle Has a very large faemmle   Among these relatives was future Academy Award winning director producer William Wyler  To his credit   Junior  Laemmle persuaded his father to bring Universal up to date  He bought and built theaters  converted the studio to sound production  and made several forays into high quality production  His early efforts included the 1929 part talkie version of Edna Ferber s novel Show Boat  the lavish musical Broadway  1929  which included Technicolor sequences  the first all color musical feature  for Universal   King of Jazz  1930   and All Quiet on the Western Front  winner of the  Best Picture  Academy Award for 1930  Laemmle  Jr  also created a successful niche for the studio  beginning a long running series of monster movies  affectionately dubbed Universal Horror  among them Frankenstein  Dracula  The Mummy and The Invisible Man  The 1931 six sheet  81 by 81 inch  poster for Frankenstein is considered to be the most valuable movie poster in the world  There is only one copy of this poster known to exist  Other Laemmle productions of this period include Imitation of Life and My Man Godfrey   edit  The Laemmles lose control Universal s forays into high quality production spelled the end of the Laemmle era at the studio  Taking on the task of modernizing and upgrading a film conglomerate in the depths of the depression was risky  and for a time Universal slipped into receivership  The theater chain was scrapped  but Carl  Jr  held fast to distribution  studio and production operations  The end for the Laemmles came with a lavish remake of its 1929 flop Show Boat  featuring several stars from the Broadway stage version  which began production in late 1935   This one was firmly based on the Broadway musical version rather than the novel   Eventually  Carl  Jr  s spending habits alarmed company stockholders  They would not allow production to start on Show Boat unless the Laemmles obtained a loan  Universal was forced to seek a  750 000 production loan from the Standard Capital Corporation  pledging the Laemmle family s controlling interest in Universal as collateral  It was the first time Universal had borrowed money for a production in its 26 year history  Production problems resulted in a  300 000 overrun  When Standard called the loan in  a cash strapped Universal couldn t pay  Standard foreclosed and seized control of the studio on April 2  1936  Universal s 1936 Show Boat  released a little over a month after Standard seized control  was a great success financially and is widely considered to be one of the greatest film musicals of all time  However  it was not enough to save the Laemmles  who were unceremoniously removed from the company they had founded  Despite the takeover  Show Boat was released with Carl Laemmle and Carl Laemmle Jr  s names on the credits and the advertising campaign for the film  Standard Capital s J  Cheever Cowdin took over as president and chairman of the board of directors  and instituted severe cuts in production budgets  Gone were the big ambitions  and though Universal had few big names under contract  those it had been cultivating  like William Wyler and Margaret Sullavan  now left  By the start of World War II  the company was concentrating on smaller budget productions that had been the company s main staples  westerns  melodramas  serials and sequels to the studio s horror pictures  Producer Joe Pasternak  who had been successfully producing light musicals with young sopranos for Universal s German subsidiary  came to America and repeated his tried and true formula  Sensational teenage songbird Deanna Durbin starred in Pasternak s first American film  Three Smart Girls  1936   The film was a box office success and restored the studio s solvency  The success of the film led Universal to offer her a contract  which for the first five years of her career produced her most successful pictures  As Pasternak stopped producing her pictures  and Durbin outgrew her screen persona and pursued more dramatic roles  the studio signed 13 year old Gloria Jean for her own series of Pasternak musicals  she went on to star with Bing Crosby  W  C  Fields  and Donald O Connor  Another hit Universal film of the late 1930s was 1939 s Destry Rides Again  starring James Stewart as Destry and Marlene Dietrich in her comeback role after leaving Paramount Studios  Universal could seldom afford its own stable of stars  and often borrowed talent from other studios  or hired freelance actors  In addition to Stewart and Dietrich  Margaret Sullavan  and Bing Crosby were some of the major names that made a couple of pictures for Universal during this period  Some stars came from radio  including W  C  Fields  Edgar Bergen  and the comedy team of Abbott and Costello  Bud Abbott and Lou Costello   Abbott and Costello s military comedy Buck Privates  1941  catapulted the former burlesque comedians to worldwide success  Abbott and Costello soon became the biggest movie stars in America  surpassing Durbin s films in popularity and box office success  During the war years Universal did have a co production arrangement with producer Walter Wanger and his partner  director Fritz Lang  lending the studio some amount of prestige productions  Universal s customer base was still the neighborhood movie theaters  and the studio continued to please the public with low  to medium budget comedies  musicals  adventures  westerns  and serials  The studio also fostered many series  The Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys action features and serials  1938 43   the comic adventures of infant Baby Sandy  1938 41   Hugh Herbert comedies  1938 42   horror thrillers with Frankenstein  Dracula  The Wolf Man  The Invisible Man  and The Mummy  1931 45   Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce in Sherlock Holmes mysteries  1939 46   teenage musicals with Gloria Jean  Donald O Connor  and Peggy Ryan  1942 43   and screen adaptations of radio s Inner Sanctum Mysteries  1943 45   Alfred Hitchcock was also borrowed for two films from Selznick International Pictures  both were made in 1942 and were considered early examples of film noir  Saboteur  released in 1942  and Shadow of a Doubt  released in 1943   As Universal s main product had always been low budget film  it was one of the last major studios to have a contract with Technicolor  The studio first made use of the new  three color Technicolor process in 1942  when it released Arabian Nights  starring Jon Hall and Maria Montez  The following year  Technicolor was also used in Universal s remake of their 1925 horror melodrama  Phantom of the Opera with Claude Rains and Nelson Eddy  With the success of their first two pictures  a regular schedule of high budget  Technicolor films followed  usually starring Montez and Hall   edit  Universal International In 1945  the British entrepreneur J  Arthur Rank  hoping to expand his American presence  bought into a four way merger with Universal  the independent company International Pictures  and producer Kenneth Young  The new combine  United World Pictures  was a failure and was dissolved within one year  Rank and International remained interested in Universal  however  culminating in the studio s reorganization as Universal International  William Goetz  a founder of International  was made head of production at the renamed Universal International Pictures Inc   which also served as an import export subsidiary  and copyright holder for the production arm s films  Goetz  a son in law of Louis B  Mayer decided to bring  prestige  to the new company  He stopped the studio s low budget production of B movies  films under 65 minutes   serials and curtailed Universal s famous  monster  and  Arabian Nights  series  Distribution and copyright control remained under the name of Universal Pictures Company Inc  Universal International Studio  1955  Goetz set out an ambitious schedule  Universal International became responsible for the American distribution of Rank s British productions  including such screen classics as David Lean s Great Expectations and Laurence Olivier s Hamlet  Broadening its scope further  Universal International branched out into the lucrative nontheatrical field  buying a majority stake in home movie dealer Castle Films in 1947  and taking the company over entirely in 1951  For three decades  Castle would offer  highlights  reels from the Universal film library to home movie enthusiasts and collectors  Goetz licensed Universal s pre Universal International film library to Jack Broeder s Realart Pictures for cinema re release but Realart was not allowed to show the films on television  The production arm of the studio still struggled  While there were to be a few hits like The Egg  amp  I  The Killers  and The Naked City  Universal International s new theatrical films often met with disappointing response at the box office  By the late 1940s  Goetz was out  and the studio reverted once more to the low budget fare it knew best  The inexpensive Francis the Talking Mule and Ma and Pa Kettle series became mainstays of the new company  Once again  the films of Abbott and Costello  including Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein  were among the studio s top grossing productions  But at this point Rank lost interest and sold his shares to the investor Milton Rackmil  whose Decca Records would take full control of Universal in 1952  Besides Abbott and Costello  the studio retained the Walter Lantz cartoon studio whose product was released with Universal International s films  In the 1950s  Universal International brought back a series of Arabian Nights films  many starring Tony Curtis  The studio also had a success with monster and science fiction films produced by William Alland with many directed by Jack Arnold  Other successes were big budget melodramas produced by Ross Hunter and directed by Douglas Sirk  Among Universal International s stable of stars were Rock Hudson  Tony Curtis  Jeff Chandler  Audie Murphy and John Gavin  Though Decca would continue to keep picture budgets lean  it was favored by changing circumstances in the film business  as other studios let their contract actors go in the wake of the 1948 U S  vs  Paramount Pictures  et al  case  Leading actors were increasingly free to work where and when they chose  and in 1950 MCA agent Lew Wasserman made a deal with Universal for his client James Stewart that would change the rules of the business  Wasserman s deal gave Stewart a share in the profits of three pictures in lieu of a large salary  When one of those films  Winchester  73 proved to be a hit  Stewart became a rich man  This arrangement would become the rule for many future productions at Universal  and eventually at other studios as well   edit  MCA takes over By the late 1950s  the motion picture business was in trouble  The combination of the studio theater chain break up and the rise of television saw the mass audience drift away  probably forever  The Music Corporation of America  better known as MCA   mainly a talent agency  had also become a powerful television producer  renting space at Republic Studios for its Revue Productions subsidiary  After a period of complete shutdown  a moribund Universal agreed to sell its 360 acre  1 5 km   studio lot to MCA in 1958  for  11 million  renamed Revue Studios  Although MCA owned the studio lot  but not Universal Pictures  MCA was increasingly influential on Universal s product  The studio lot was upgraded and modernized  while MCA clients like Doris Day  Lana Turner  Cary Grant  and director Alfred Hitchcock were signed to Universal Pictures contracts  The long awaited takeover of Universal Pictures by MCA  Inc  finally took place in mid 1962 as part of MCA  Decca Records merger  Universal s then parent company   with MCA as surviving corporation  Universal International Pictures  the production subsidiary reverted in name back to Universal Pictures  As a last gesture before getting out of the talent agency business  virtually every MCA client was signed to a Universal contract  In 1964 MCA formed Universal City Studios  Inc  to take over the motion pictures and television arms of Universal Pictures Company and Revue Productions  officially renamed as Universal Television in 1966   And so  with MCA in charge  for a few years in the 1960s Universal became what it had never been  a full blown  first class movie studio  with leading actors and directors under contract  offering slick  commercial films  and a studio tour subsidiary  launched in 1964   But it was too late  since the audience was no longer there  and by 1968  the film production unit began to downsize  Television carried the load  as Universal dominated the American networks  particularly NBC  which later merged with Universal to form NBC Universal  see below   where for several seasons it provided up to half of all prime time shows  An innovation of which Universal was especially proud was the creation in this period of the made for television movie  Gate to Universal Studios  Hollywood Though Universal s film unit did produce occasional hits  among them Airport  The Sting  American Graffiti  Earthquake  and a blockbuster that restored the company s fortunes  Jaws  Universal in the 1970s was primarily a television studio  Weekly series production was the workhorse of the company  There would be other film hits like E T  the Extra Terrestrial  Back to the Future  and Jurassic Park  but the film business was still hit and miss   edit  Universal Productions France In the early 1950s  Universal set up its own distribution company in France  and in the late 1960s  the company also started a production company in Paris  Universal Productions France S A   although sometimes credited by the name of the distribution company  Universal Pictures France  Except for the two first films it produced  Claude Chabrol s Le scandale  English title The Champagne Murders  and Romain Gary s Les oiseaux vont mourir au P rou  English title Birds in Peru   it was only involved in French or other European co productions  the most noticeable ones being Louis Malle s Lacombe  Lucien  Bertrand Blier s Les Valseuses  English title Going Places   and Fred Zinnemann s The Day of the Jackal  It was only involved in some 20 film productions before being dismantled in the mid 1970s  6  7   edit  CIC and UIP In the early 1970s  Universal teamed up with Paramount Pictures to form Cinema International Corporation  which distributed films by Paramount and Universal worldwide  It was replaced by United International Pictures in 1981  when Metro Goldwyn Mayer joined the fold  UIP began distributing films by start up studio DreamWorks in 1997  and MGM subsequently dropped out of the venture in 2001  letting 20th Century Fox internationally distribute its films  In 1990  MCA created MCA Universal Home Video Inc  to enter the lucrative videotape and later DVD sales industry   edit  Matsushita and Vivendi Anxious to expand the company s broadcast and cable presence  longtime MCA head Lew Wasserman sought a rich partner  He located Matsushita Electric  AKA Panasonic   the Japanese electronics manufacturer  which agreed to acquire MCA for  6 6 billion in 1990  Around this time  the production subsidiary was renamed Universal Studios Inc  Matsushita provided a cash infusion  but the clash of cultures was too great to overcome  and five years later Matsushita sold an 80  stake in MCA Universal to Canadian liquor distributor Seagram for  5 7 billion  8  Seagram sold off its stake in DuPont to fund this expansion into the entertainment industry  Hoping to build an entertainment empire around Universal  Seagram bought PolyGram in 1999 and other entertainment properties  but the fluctuating profits characteristic of Hollywood were no substitute for the reliable income stream gained from the previously held shares in DuPont  Western set at Universal Studios Hollywood To raise money  Seagram head Edgar Bronfman Jr  sold Universal s television holdings  including cable network USA  to Barry Diller   These same properties would be bought back later at greatly inflated prices   In June 2000  Seagram was sold to French water utility and media company Vivendi  which owns StudioCanal   The media conglomerate became Vivendi Universal  Afterward  Universal Pictures acquired the United States distribution rights of several of StudioCanal s films  such as Mulholland Drive  which received an Oscar nomination  and Brotherhood of the Wolf  which became the second highest grossing French language film in the United States in the last two decades   Universal Pictures and StudioCanal also co produced several films  such as Love Actually  an  40 million budgeted film that eventually grossed  246 million worldwide   9   edit  NBC Universal Logo from 1997 2012 Burdened with debt  in 2004 Vivendi Universal sold 80  of Vivendi Universal Entertainment  including the studio and theme parks  to General Electric  parent of NBC  The resulting media super conglomerate was renamed NBC Universal  while Universal Studios Inc  remained the name of the production subsidiary  Though some expressed doubts that regimented  profit minded GE and high living Hollywood could coexist  as of 2007 the combination has worked  The reorganized  Universal  film conglomerate has enjoyed several financially successful years  After that deal  GE owned 80  of NBC Universal  Vivendi held the remaining 20   with an option to sell its share in 2006  GE purchased Vivendi s share in NBCU 10  in 2010 and in turn sold 51  of the company to cable provider Comcast  11  Comcast merged the former GE subsidiary with its own cable television programming assets  creating the current NBCUniversal  Following FCC approval  the Comcast GE deal was closed on Jan  29  2011  12  In late 2005  Viacom s Paramount Pictures acquired DreamWorks SKG after acquisition talks between GE and DreamWorks stalled  Universal s long time chairperson  Stacey Snider  left the company in early 2006 to head up DreamWorks  Snider was replaced by then Vice Chairman Marc Shmuger and Focus Features head David Linde  On October 5  2009 Marc Shmuger and David Linde were ousted and their co chairperson jobs consolidated under former president of worldwide marketing and distribution Adam Fogelson becoming the single chairperson  Donna Langley was also upped to co chairperson  13  Over the years  Universal has made deals to distribute and or co finance films with various small companies  such as Imagine Entertainment  Media Rights Capital  Amblin Entertainment  Morgan Creek Productions  Spyglass Entertainment  Working Title Films  and DreamWorks   StudioCanal  Relativity Media  Strike Entertainment  Shady Acres
