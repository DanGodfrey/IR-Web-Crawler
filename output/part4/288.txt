NC 17 rating from the MPAA  solely for the graphic language  Miramax hired Alan Dershowitz to defend the film  and at an appeals screening  a jury consisting of members of the National Association of Theater Owners reversed the MPAA s decision  and the film was given an R rating instead  Smith s second film  Mallrats  did not fare as well as expected after the remarkable success of Clerks  It received a critical drubbing and earned merely  2 2 million at the box office  despite playing on more than 500 screens  The film marked Jason Lee s debut as a leading man  Despite failing at the box office during its theatrical run  Mallrats proved more successful in the home video market  Widely hailed as Smith s best film  Chasing Amy marked what Quentin Tarantino called  a quantum leap forward  for Smith  Starring Mallrats alumni Jason Lee  Joey Lauren Adams and Ben Affleck  the  250 000 film earned  12 million at the box office and wound up on a number of critics  year end best lists  and won two Independent Spirit Awards  screenplay and supporting actor for Lee   In 1996  Smith worked on a script for a Superman movie  He did a couple of drafts but his script was dropped when Tim Burton was hired to direct  Burton brought his own people to work on the project  Smith still sees the whole experience on working on the Superman project as a positive one however  he has said that he was well paid and it was a lot of fun   In April  2009  Smith discussed his Superman experiences at Clark University a YouTube video critic A O  Scott of the New York Times called  extraordinary    8   In the end  neither Smith s nor Burton s vision for Superman was filmed  In the 2007 Direct to DVD animation release of Superman  Doomsday  Smith has a cameo as an onlooker in a crowd  After Superman defeats The Toyman s giant mechanical robot  Smith scoffs   Yeah  like we really needed him to defeat that giant spider  Heh  Lame   This was a reference to a giant spider that producer Jon Peters wanted Smith to put in the Superman movie when he was attached  that was later put into the 1999 feature film flop Wild Wild West  which Peters also produced  In 1997  Smith was hired by New Line to rewrite Overnight Delivery  which was expected to be a blockbuster teen movie  Smith s then girlfriend Joey Lauren Adams almost took the role of Ivy in the movie  instead of the female lead in

but he remains uncredited  He has said that the only scene which really used his dialogue was the opening scene  which includes a reference to long time Smith friend Bryan Johnson  9  Smith s fourth film  Dogma  featured an all star cast and found itself mired in controversy  The religious themed 1999 comedy  which starred a post Good Will Hunting Ben Affleck and Matt Damon  as well as Chris Rock  Salma Hayek  George Carlin  Alan Rickman  Linda Fiorentino  and Smith regulars Jason Lee and Jason Mewes  raised criticism by the Catholic League  10  11  12  Smith at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival The film debuted at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival  out of competition  Released on 800 screens in November 1999  the  10 million film earned  30 million  Smith then focused the spotlight on two characters who had appeared in supporting roles in his previous four films  Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back featured an all star cast  with many familiar faces returning from Smith s first four films  Ben Affleck and Matt Damon appear as themselves filming a mock sequel to Good Will Hunting  The  20 million film earned  30 million at the box office and received mixed reviews from the critics  In 2004  Smith wrote a screenplay for a new film version of The Green Hornet  and announced prematurely that he had originally intended to direct as well  13  The project  however died after the film was placed into turn around following the poor box office of Jersey Girl  Smith s screenplay was turned into a Green Hornet comic book miniseries  14  Jersey Girl with Ben Affleck  Liv Tyler  George Carlin and Raquel Castro  his first outside of the View Askewniverse  was meant to mark a new direction in Smith s career  However  the film took a critical beating as it was seen as  in Smith s own words   Gigli 2   due to the fact that it co starred Affleck and his then girlfriend  Jennifer Lopez  Despite Smith heavily re editing the film to reduce Lopez s role to just a few scenes  the film did poorly at the box office  Budgeted at  35 million  it earned only  36 million  In the 2006 sequel  Clerks II  Smith revisited the Dante and Randal characters from his first film for what was his final visit to the View Askewniverse  Roundly criticized before its release  the film went on to win favorable reviews as well as two awards  the Audience Award at the Edinburgh Film Festival and the Orbit Dirtiest Mouth Award at the MTV Movie Awards   15  It marked Smith s third trip to the Cannes International Film Festival  where Clerks II received an eight minute standing ovation  16  The  5 million film  starring Jeff Anderson  Brian O Halloran  Rosario Dawson  Jason Mewes  Jennifer Schwalbach and Smith himself   reprising his role as Silent Bob   earned  25 million  That same year  Smith was featured in This Film Is Not Yet Rated  a 2006 documentary about the Motion Picture Association of America process of rating films  Smith s interview was in reference to Jersey Girl receiving an R rating  17  and Clerks originally receiving an NC 17 rating  Zack and Miri Make a Porno was originally announced in March 2006 as Smith s second non Askewniverse comedy  18  The film  which began shooting on January 18  2008 in Monroeville  Pennsylvania  and wrapped on March 15  2008  stars Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks as the title characters who decide to make a low budget pornographic film to solve their money problems  The film  which was released on October 31  2008  ran into many conflicts getting an  R  rating  with Rogen stating    It s a really filthy movie  I hear they are having some problems getting an R rating from an NC 17 rating  which is never good    They  fight against  sex stuff  Isn t that weird  It s really crazy to me that Hostel is fine  with people gouging their eyes out and shit like that  but you can t show two people having sex   that s too much  19    Smith took the film through the MPAA s appeals process and received the R rating  without having to make any further edits  20 Zack and Miri Make a Porno was considered a box office  flop  21  22  in part because of  tepid media advertising for a movie with the title PORNO   21  and  in the aftermath of the film s  flaccid  performance  the business relationship between Smith and producer Harvey Weinstein became  frayed   23  It was announced in 2009 that Smith had signed on to direct a buddy cop comedy starring Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan called A Couple of Dicks and written by the Cullen Brothers  24  Due to controversy surrounding the original title  it was changed to A Couple of Cops  25  before reverting back its original title  A Couple of Dicks  due to negative reaction  26  before finally settling on the title Cop Out  27  The film  which was shot between June and August 2009  involved a pair of veteran cops tracking down a stolen vintage baseball card  28  and was released on February 26  2010 to poor reviews  it was the first film that Smith has directed but not written  With a worldwide domestic gross of  55 583 804  Cop Out is Smith s highest grossing film to date  29  In September 2010  Smith started work on Red State  an independently financed horror film inspired by the Westboro Baptist Church and their Pastor Fred Phelps  30  31  32  In February 2010  he talked about his project with Cinssu  33  34  Film producers and moguls Bob and Harvey Weinstein who had thus far been involved in the distribution of most of Smith s films  with the exception of Mallrats and Cop Out  declined to support Red State  35  36  37  38  39  The film stars Michael Parks  John Goodman  Melissa Leo and Stephen Root  Smith had indicated that he would auction off rights to the  4 million film at a controversial event following the debut screening of the film at Sundance but instead  kept the rights to the film himself with plans to self distribute the picture  under the Smodcast Pictures  banner  The film was released via Video on Demand on September 1  2011 through Lionsgate  will be released in select theaters again for a special one night only engagement on September 25  2011  via Smodcast Pictures   and was released on home video October 18  2011  40  41  Kevin Smith listed Mel Gibson as a role model he looked up to  and his inspiration  for how he planned to distribute this movie  citing Gibson s The Passion of the Christ as an example of a successfully self distributed movie  42  He further explained his decision as a way to return to an era when marketing a film did not cost four times as much as the film itself  a situation he has described as  both decadent and deadening   43  The film was released in January 2011  The premiere drew protests from a half dozen members of the church  along with many more who counter protested Westboro members  44  Smith will direct a hockey drama comedy based on the song  Hit Somebody  The Hockey Song   by Warren Zevon  The song  which is about a hockey player famous for fighting in the rink  was co written by Tuesdays With Morrie author Mitch Albom  who is working with Smith on the film  45  Although Smith had previously mentioned other projects he had planned  46  47  48  he announced at the Sundance premiere of Red State that Hit Somebody will be the last movie he ever directs  and that he will continue to tell stories in other media  49  50  In August Hit Somebody was announced as a two part film titled Hit Somebody  Home and Hit Somebody  Away with part one being PG 13 and part 2 being Rated R  51  Smith further explained his retirement from directing  citing distribution politics  and the manner in which making films like Zack and Miri  adulterated  his own identity as a filmmaker  saying   I don t have the same passion for it I used to  I don t have any stories left to tell   Smith further emphasized that he sees himself as a writer rather than a director  and that Harvey Weinstein developed his career as a celebrity auteur because  my films were never strong enough to stand up on their own   43 Daily Beast writer Chris Lee reported in September 2011 that those close to Smith cite the failure of Zack and Miri  and Smith s constant marijuana consumption as a contributing factor to his categorization of those around him into  friendly or enemy camps   his tendency to sequester himself from those he perceives as being against him  and his retirement from the film industry  Smith states that he is merely reinventing himself as an artist  which he refers to as  Kevin Smith 2 0   and cites his 70 lb  weight loss  his deals for a book and two television pilots  and his starting an online radio station  52  Comics and magazines Smith has been a regular contributor to Arena magazine  In 2005  Miramax Books released Smith s first

lives in an apartment between the Quick Stop and RST Video  Third was Clerks  The Lost Scene  showing what happened inside Poston s Funeral Parlor  This story was later animated in the TV series style

Marvel for two mini series  Spider Man Black Cat  The Evil That Men Do and Daredevil Bullseye  The Target  both of which debuted in 2002  The former was six issues long  but after the third issue was published two months after the initially scheduled release date  the final issues were delayed for at least three years  prompting Marvel to release an  in case you missed it  reprinting of the first three issues as one book prior to the remaining issues  release  The delay in part was due to Smith s movie production schedule  in this case  work on Jersey Girl and Clerks II  causing him to shelve completion of the mini series until the films were completed  In 2007 he was announced as the writer of an ongoing Black Cat series 56  and The Amazing Spider Man 57  58  in early to mid 2002  However  because of the delays on Evil That Men Do and The Target  the plan was switched so that Smith would start a third Spider Man title  59  launched in 2004 by Mark Millar instead  While Spider Man Black Cat was ultimately completed in 2005  Daredevil Bullseye  The Target remains unfinished  with one issue published  Smith wrote the limited series Batman  Cacophony  with art by friend Walt Flanagan

project that never came to fruition  14  62  In August 2011  Dynamite Entertainment debuted The Bionic Man by Smith  which was based on a 1998 script he wrote that was rejected by Universal as being  more like a comic book than a movie   63  Television In 2000  Smith and Mosier teamed up with television writer David Mandel to develop an animated television show based on Clerks  called Clerks  The

did not object to his presence  Smith was then removed from the flight after being told he was a safety concern  After being booked on a later flight and being offered a  100 Southwest Airlines voucher  which he turned down  Smith lashed out at Southwest Airlines on his Twitter account  Southwest Airlines representatives later released two statements regarding the incident via their blog  80  In the first statement  Southwest claimed that Mr  Smith  has been known to       purchase two Southwest seats  and cited its  Customer of Size  policy which requires that customers who cannot put their armrests down purchase two seats  In his podcast  Smith stated that he regularly purchased two seats  and had done so the previous week  because he preferred not having to sit next to anyone  not due to his size  In releasing this statement  Southwest disclosed Smith s personal travel details without his permission  The first statement also claimed that the flight captain has personally determined that Smith was too large to fly  In its second statement  Southwest contradicted this claim  stating that the captain had not singled out Smith  81  Smith later released an entire episode

repeatedly lied to by airline personnel  He also referred to the airline as the  Greyhound of the Air  and vowed to never fly the airline again  82  In his podcast  Smith stated that on his return flight a large female passenger was told to ask him if it was all right that she was sitting next to an empty seat he had bought between them  and it was suggested by Southwest staffers that she may need to purchase an additional seat due to her size  even though she had been placed next to an already purchased empty seat  She was also the subject of an episode of SModcast  83  Smith also

marijuana  86  Smith admitted in an interview that heavy marijuana smoking had become an integral part of his work ethic after claiming that he watched actor Seth Rogen on the set of Zack and Miri Make a Porno use marijuana as a tool to become a more creative and  productive  worker  saying  The moment I start smoking  I start working      That way  no one could ever take it away from you   87
