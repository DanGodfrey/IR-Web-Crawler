Republic of C te d Ivoire i  ko t d  vw r   French   kot d ivwa    or Ivory Coast i  a v ri  ko st  4  5  is a country in West Africa  It has an area of 322 462 square kilometres  124 503 sq mi   and borders the countries Liberia  Guinea  Mali  Burkina Faso and Ghana  its southern boundary is along the Gulf of Guinea  The country s population was 15 366 672 in 1998 6  and was estimated to be 20 617 068 in 2009  1  C te d Ivoire s first national census in 1975 counted 6 7 million inhabitants  7  Prior to its colonization by Europeans  C te d Ivoire was home to several states  including Gyaaman  the Kong Empire  and Baoul   There were two Anyi kingdoms  Ind ni  and Sanwi  which attempted to retain their separate identity through the French colonial period and after C te d Ivoire s independence  8  An 1843 1844 treaty made C te d Ivoire a protectorate of France and in 1893  it became a French colony as part of the European scramble for Africa  C te d Ivoire became independent on 7 August 1960  From 1960 to 1993  the country was led by F lix Houphou t Boigny  It maintained close political and economic association with its West African neighbours  while at the same time maintaining close ties to the West  especially to France  Since the end of Houphou t Boigny s rule  C te d Ivoire has experienced one coup d  tat  in 1999  and a civil war  which broke out in 2002  9  A political agreement between the government and the rebels brought a return to peace  10  C te d Ivoire is a republic with a strong executive power invested in the President  Its de jure capital is Yamoussoukro and the biggest city is the port city of Abidjan  The country is divided into 19 regions and 81 departments  It is a member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation  African Union  La Francophonie  Latin Union  Economic Community of West African States and South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone  The official language is French  although many of the local languages are widely used  including Baoul   Dioula  Dan  Anyin and Cebaara Senufo  The main religions are Islam  Christianity  primarily Roman Catholic  and various indigenous religions  Through production of coffee and cocoa  the country was an economic powerhouse during the 1960s and 1970s in West Africa  However  C te d Ivoire went through an economic crisis in the 1980s  leading to the country s period of political and social turmoil  The 21st century Ivoirian economy is largely market based and relies heavily on agriculture  with smallholder cash crop production being dominant  1  Contents 1 Etymology

country be changed to C te d Ivoire in all languages  11  Despite the Ivorian government s request  the English translation  Ivory Coast   sometimes  the Ivory Coast   is still frequently used in English  The BBC usually uses  Ivory Coast  both in news reports and on its page about the country  12 The Guardian newspaper s style guide says   Ivory Coast  not  The Ivory Coast  or  C te d Ivoire   its nationals are Ivorians   13 ABC News  The Times  The New York Times  and the South African Broadcasting Corporation all use  Ivory Coast  either exclusively or predominantly  Many governments use  C te d Ivoire  for diplomatic reasons  as do their outlets  such as the Chinese CCTV News  The English country name registered with the United Nations and used by ISO 3166 is  C te d Ivoire   Other organizations that use  C te d Ivoire  include FIFA and the IOC  referring to their national football and Olympic teams in international games and in official broadcasts   The Economist newsmagazine

northern C te d Ivoire  Photo taken at the IFAN Museum of African Arts in Dakar  Senegal  The first human presence in C te d Ivoire has been difficult to determine because human remains have not been well preserved in the country s humid climate  However  the presence of newly found weapon and tool fragments  specifically  polished axes cut through shale and remnants of cooking and fishing  has been interpreted as a possible indication of a large human presence during the Upper Paleolithic period  15 000 to 10 000 BC   17  or at the minimum  the Neolithic period  18  The earliest known inhabitants of C te d Ivoire have left traces scattered throughout the territory  Historians believe that they were all either displaced or absorbed by the ancestors of the present indigenous inhabitants  who migrated south into the area before the 16th century  Such groups included the Ehotil   Aboisso   Kotrowou  Fresco   Z hiri  Grand Lahou   Ega and Di s  Divo   19   edit  Pre Islamic and Islamic periods The first recorded history is found in the chronicles of North African  Berber  traders  who  from early Roman times  conducted a caravan trade across the Sahara in salt  slaves  gold  and other goods  The southern terminals of the trans Saharan trade routes were located on the edge of the desert  and from there supplemental trade extended as far south as the edge of the rain forest  The more important terminals Djenn   Gao  and Timbuctu grew into major commercial centres around which the great Sudanic empires developed  By controlling the trade routes with their powerful military forces  these empires were able to dominate neighbouring states  The Sudanic empires also became centres of Islamic education  Islam had been introduced in the western Sudan  today s Mali  by Muslim Berber traders from North Africa  it spread rapidly after the conversion of many important rulers  From the eleventh century  by which time the rulers of the Sudanic empires had embraced Islam  it spread south into the northern areas of contemporary C te d Ivoire  The Ghana empire  the earliest of the Sudanic empires  flourished in present day eastern Mauritania from the fourth to the thirteenth century  At the peak of its power in the eleventh century  its realms extended from the Atlantic Ocean to Timbuctu  After the decline of Ghana  the Mali Empire grew into a powerful Muslim state  which reached its apogee in the early part of the fourteenth century  The territory of the Mali Empire in C te d Ivoire was limited to the north west corner around Odienn   Its slow decline starting at the end of the fourteenth century followed internal discord and revolts by vassal states  one of which  Songhai  flourished as an empire between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries  Songhai was also weakened by internal discord  which led to factional warfare  This discord spurred most of the migrations of peoples southward toward the forest belt  The dense rain forest  covering the southern half of the country  created barriers to the large scale political organizations that had arisen in the north  Inhabitants lived in villages or clusters of villages  their contacts with the outside world were filtered through long distance traders  Villagers subsisted on agriculture and hunting   edit  Pre European era Pre Colonial kingdoms  Five important states flourished in C te d Ivoire in the pre European era  The Muslim Kong Empire was established by the Juula in the early eighteenth century in the north central region inhabited by the S noufo  who had fled Islamization under the Mali Empire  Although Kong became a prosperous center of agriculture  trade  and crafts  ethnic diversity and religious discord gradually weakened the kingdom  The city of Kong was destroyed in 1895 by Samori Ture  The Abron kingdom of Gyaaman was established in the seventeenth century by an Akan group  the Abron  who had fled the developing Ashanti confederation of Asanteman in what is present day Ghana  From their settlement south of Bondoukou  the Abron gradually extended their hegemony over the Dyula people in Bondoukou  who were recent  migr s from the market city of Begho  Bondoukou developed into a major centre of commerce and Islam  The kingdom s Quranic scholars attracted students from all parts of West Africa  In the mid seventeenth century in east central C te d Ivoire  other Akan groups  fleeing the Asante established a Baoul  kingdom at Sakasso and two Agni kingdoms  Ind ni  and Sanwi  The Baoul   like the Ashanti  developed a highly centralized political and administrative structure under three successive rulers  It finally split into smaller chiefdoms  Despite the breakup of their kingdom  the Baoul  strongly resisted French subjugation  The descendants of the rulers of the Agni kingdoms tried to retain their separate identity long after C te d Ivoire s independence  as late as 1969  the Sanwi attempted to break away from C te d Ivoire and form an independent kingdom  20 Michael Jackson visited Krinjabo  the capital of Sanwi  in 1992 and met with the king  21  The current king of Sanwi is Nana Amon Ndoufou V  since 2002    edit  Establishment of French rule Compared to neighbouring Ghana  C te d Ivoire suffered little from the slave trade  as European slaving and merchant ships preferred other areas along the coast with better harbours  The earliest recorded European voyage to West Africa was made by the Portuguese and took place in 1482  The first West African French settlement  Saint Louis  was founded in the mid seventeenth century in Senegal while  at about the same time  the Dutch ceded to the French a settlement at Goree Island off Dakar  A French mission was established in 1637 Assinie near the border with the Gold Coast  now Ghana   Assinie s survival was precarious  however  It was not until the mid nineteenth century that the French were firmly established in C te d Ivoire  In 1843 1844  French admiral Bou t Willaumez signed treaties with the kings of the Grand Bassam and Assinie regions  placing their territories under a French protectorate  French explorers  missionaries  trading companies  and soldiers gradually extended the area under French control inland from the lagoon region  Pacification was not accomplished until 1915  Activity along the coast stimulated European interest in the interior  especially along the two great rivers  the Senegal and the Niger  Concerted French exploration of West Africa began in the mid nineteenth century but moved slowly  based more on individual initiative than on government policy  In the 1840s  the French concluded a series of treaties with local West African rulers that enabled the French to build fortified posts along the Gulf of Guinea to serve as permanent trading centres  Louis Gustave Binger of French West Africa in 1892 treaty signing with Famienkro leaders  in present day N zi Como  Region  C te d Ivoire  The first posts in C te d Ivoire included one at Assinie and another at Grand Bassam  which became the colony s first capital  The treaties provided for French sovereignty within the posts  and for trading privileges in exchange for fees or coutumes paid annually to the local rulers for the use of the land  The arrangement was not entirely satisfactory to the French  because trade was limited and misunderstandings over treaty obligations often arose  Nevertheless  the French government maintained the treaties  hoping to expand trade  France also wanted to maintain a presence in the region to stem the increasing influence of the British along the Gulf of Guinea coast  The French built naval bases to keep out non French traders and began a systematic conquest of the interior   They accomplished this only after a long war in the 1890s against Mandinka forces  mostly from Gambia  Guerrilla warfare by the Baoul  and other eastern groups continued until 1917   citation needed  The defeat of France in the Franco Prussian War in 1871 and the subsequent annexation by Germany of the French province of Alsace Lorraine caused the French government to abandon its colonial ambitions and withdraw its military garrisons from its French West African trading posts  leaving them in the care of resident merchants  The trading post at Grand Bassam in C te d Ivoire was left in the care of a shipper from Marseille  Arthur Verdier  who in 1878 was named Resident of the Establishment of C te d Ivoire  20  In 1886  to support its claims of effective occupation  France again assumed direct control of its West African coastal trading posts and embarked on an accelerated program of exploration in the interior  In 1887 Lieutenant Louis Gustave Binger began a two year journey that traversed parts of C te d Ivoire s interior  By the end of the journey  he had concluded four treaties establishing French protectorates in C te d Ivoire  Also in 1887  Verdier s agent  Marcel Treich Lapl ne  negotiated five additional agreements that extended French influence from the headwaters of the Niger River Basin through C te d Ivoire   edit  French colonial era By the end of the 1880s  France had established what passed for control over the coastal regions of C te d Ivoire  and in 1889 Britain recognized French sovereignty in the area  That same year  France named Treich Lapl ne titular governor of the territory  In 1893 C te d Ivoire was made a French colony  and then Captain Binger was appointed governor  Agreements with Liberia in 1892 and with Britain in 1893 determined the eastern and western boundaries of the colony  but the northern boundary was not fixed until 1947 because of efforts by the French government to attach parts of Upper Volta  present day Burkina Faso  and French Sudan  present day Mali  to C te d Ivoire for economic and administrative reasons  France s main goal was to stimulate the production of exports  Coffee  cocoa and palm oil crops were soon planted along the coast  C te d Ivoire stood out as the only West African country with a sizeable population of settlers  elsewhere in West and Central Africa  the French and British were largely bureaucrats  citation needed  As a result  French citizens owned one third of the cocoa  coffee and banana plantations and adopted a forced labour system  Throughout the early years of French rule  French military contingents were sent inland to establish new posts  The African population resisted French penetration and settlement  Among those offering greatest resistance was Samori Ture  who in the 1880s and 1890s was establishing the Wassoulou Empire  which extended over large parts of present day Guinea  Mali  Burkina Faso  and C te d Ivoire  Samori Ture s large  well equipped army  which could manufacture and repair its own firearms  attracted strong support throughout the region  The French responded to Samori Ture s expansion of regional control with military pressure  French campaigns against Samori Ture  which were met with fierce resistance  intensified in the mid 1890s until he was captured in 1898  France s imposition of a head tax in 1900 to support the colony in a public works program  provoked a number of revolts  Ivoirians viewed the tax as a violation of the terms of the protectorate treaties  because they thought that France was demanding the equivalent of a coutume from the local kings  rather than the reverse  Much of the population  especially in the interior  considered the tax a humiliating symbol of submission  22  From 1904 to 1958  C te d Ivoire was a constituent unit of the Federation of French West Africa  It was a colony and an overseas territory under the Third Republic  Until the period following World War II  governmental affairs in French West Africa were administered from Paris  France s policy in West Africa was reflected mainly in its philosophy of  association   meaning that all Africans in C te d Ivoire were officially French  subjects   but without rights to representation in Africa or France  French colonial policy incorporated concepts of assimilation and association  Based on an assumption of the superiority of French culture over all others  in practice the assimilation policy meant extension of the French language  institutions  laws  and customs in the colonies  The policy of association also affirmed the superiority of the French in the colonies  but it entailed different institutions and systems of laws for the colonizer and the colonized  Under this policy  the Africans in C te d Ivoire were allowed to preserve their own customs insofar as they were compatible with French interests  An indigenous elite trained in French administrative practice formed an intermediary group between the French and the Africans  Assimilation was practiced in C te d Ivoire to the extent that after 1930  a small number of Westernized Ivoirians were granted the right to apply for French citizenship  Most Ivoirians  however  were classified as French subjects and were governed under the principle of association  23  As subjects of France  they had no political rights  They were drafted for work in mines  on plantations  as porters  and on public projects as part of their tax responsibility  They were expected to serve in the military and were subject to the indig nat  a separate system of law  24  In World War II  the Vichy regime remained in control until 1943  when members of Gen  Charles de Gaulle s provisional government assumed control of all French West Africa  The Brazzaville Conference of 1944  the first Constituent Assembly of the Fourth Republic in 1946  and France s gratitude for African loyalty during World War II led to far reaching governmental reforms in 1946  French citizenship was granted to all African  subjects   the right to organize politically was recognized  and various forms of forced labour were abolished  Until 1958  governors appointed in Paris administered the colony of C te d Ivoire  using a system of direct  centralized administration that left little room for Ivoirian participation in policy making  Whereas British colonial administration adopted divide and rule policies elsewhere  applying ideas of assimilation only to the educated elite  the French were interested in ensuring that the small but influential elite was sufficiently satisfied with the status quo to refrain from any anti French sentiment  Although strongly opposed to the practices of association  educated Ivoirians believed that they would achieve equality with their French peers through assimilation rather than through complete independence from France  But  after the assimilation doctrine was implemented entirely through the postwar reforms  Ivoirian leaders realized that even assimilation implied the superiority of the French over the Ivoirians  and that discrimination and political inequality would end only with independence  25   edit  Independence The son of a Baoul  chief  F lix Houphou t Boigny  was to become C te d Ivoire s father of independence  In 1944 he formed the country s first agricultural trade union for African cocoa farmers like himself  Angered that colonial policy favoured French plantation owners  they united to recruit migrant workers for their own farms  Houphou t Boigny soon rose to prominence and within a year was elected to the French Parliament in Paris  A year later the French abolished forced labour  Houphou t Boigny established a strong relationship with the French government  expressing a belief that the country would benefit from it  which it did for many years  France appointed him as the first African to become a minister in a European government  A turning point in relations with France was reached with the 1956 Overseas Reform Act  Loi Cadre   which transferred a number of powers from Paris to elected territorial governments in French West Africa and also removed remaining voting inequalities  In 1958  C te d Ivoire became an autonomous member of the French Community  which replaced the French Union   At the time of C te d Ivoire s independence  1960   the country was easily French West Africa s most prosperous  contributing over 40  of the region s total exports  When Houphou t Boigny became the first president  his government gave farmers good prices for their products to further stimulate production  This was further boosted by a significant immigration of workers from surrounding countries  Coffee production increased significantly  catapulting C te d Ivoire into third place in world output  behind Brazil and Colombia   By 1979  the country was the world s leading producer of cocoa  It also became Africa s leading exporter of pineapples and palm oil  French technicians contributed to the  Ivoirian miracle   In other African nations  the people drove out the Europeans following independence  but in C te d Ivoire  they poured in  The French community grew from only 30 000 prior to independence to 60 000 in 1980  most of them teachers  managers and advisors  26  For 20 years  the economy maintained an annual growth rate of nearly 10  the highest of Africa s non oil exporting countries   edit  Houphou t Boigny administration First Ivorian Civil War Houphou t Boigny s one party rule was not amenable to political competition  Laurent Gbagbo  who would be the president of C te d Ivoire in 2000  had to flee as he incurred the ire of Houphou t Boigny when Gbagbo founded the Front Populair Ivoirien  27  Houphou t Boigny banked on his broad appeal to the population who continually elected him  He was also criticized for his emphasis on developing large scale projects  Many felt the millions of dollars spent transforming his home village  Yamoussoukro  into the new capital that it became  were wasted  others support his vision to develop a centre for peace  education and religion in the heart of the country  But in the early 1980s  the world recession and a local drought sent shock waves through the Ivoirian economy  Due to the overcutting of timber and collapsing sugar prices  the country s external debt increased threefold  Crime rose dramatically in Abidjan  citation needed  In 1990  hundreds of civil servants went on strike  joined by students protesting institutional corruption  The unrest forced the government to support multi party democracy  Houphou t Boigny became increasingly feeble and died in 1993  He favoured Henri Konan B di  as his successor   edit  B di  administration In October 1995  B di  overwhelmingly won re election against a fragmented and disorganised opposition  He tightened his hold over political life  jailing several hundred opposition supporters  In contrast  the economic outlook improved  at least superficially  with decreasing inflation and an attempt to remove foreign debt  Election results of 2002 in C te d Ivoire Unlike Houphou t Boigny  who was very careful in avoiding any ethnic conflict and left access to administrative positions open to immigrants from neighbouring countries  Bedi  emphasized the concept of  Ivority   French  Ivoirit   to exclude his rival Alassane Ouattara  who had two northern Ivorian parents  from running for future presidential election  As people originating from foreign countries are a large part of the Ivoirian population  this policy excluded many people from Ivoirian nationality  and the relationship between various ethnic groups became strained which will result in two civil wars in the following decades   edit  1999 coup Similarly  B di  excluded many potential opponents from the army  In late 1999  a group of dissatisfied officers staged a military coup  putting General Robert Gu   in power  B di  fled into exile in France  The new leadership reduced crime and corruption  and the generals pressed for austerity and openly campaigned in the streets for a less wasteful society   edit  Gbagbo administration A presidential election was held in October 2000 in which Laurent Gbagbo vied with Gu    but it was peaceful  The lead up to the election was marked by military and civil unrest  Following a public uprising that resulted in around 180 deaths  Gu   was swiftly replaced by Gbagbo  Alassane Ouattara was disqualified by the country s Supreme Court  due to his alleged Burkinab  nationality  The existing and later reformed constitution  under Gu    did not allow non citizens to run for presidency  This sparked violent protests in which his supporters  mainly from the country s north  battled riot police in the capital  Yamoussoukro   edit  Ivorian Civil War Main article  First Ivorian Civil War In the early hours of 19 September 2002  while the President was in Italy  there was an armed uprising  Troops who were to be demobilised mutinied  launching attacks in several cities  The battle for the main gendarmerie barracks in Abidjan lasted until mid morning  but by lunchtime the government forces had secured the main city  Abidjan  They had lost control of the north of the country  and the rebel forces made their strong hold in the northern city of Bouake  The rebels threatened to move on Abidjan again and France deployed troops from its base in the country to stop any rebel advance  The French said they were protecting their own citizens from danger  but their deployment also aided the government forces  It was not established as a fact that the French were helping either side but each side accused them of being on the opposite side  It is disputed as to whether the French actions improved or worsened the situation in the long term  What exactly happened that night is disputed  The government claimed that former president Robert Gu   had led a coup attempt  and state TV showed pictures of his dead body in the street  counter claims stated that he and fifteen others had been murdered at his home and his body had been moved to the streets to incriminate him  Alassane Ouattara took refuge in the French embassy  his home had burned down  President Gbagbo cut short his trip to Italy and on his return stated  in a television address  that some of the rebels were hiding in the shanty towns where foreign migrant workers lived  Gendarmes and vigilantes bulldozed and burned homes by the thousands  attacking the residents   Child soldier in the Ivory Coast    drawing by Gilbert G  Groud  An early ceasefire with the rebels  which had the backing of much of the northern populace  proved short lived  and fighting over the prime cocoa growing areas resumed  France sent in troops to maintain the cease fire boundaries  28  and militias  including warlords and fighters from Liberia and Sierra Leone  took advantage of the crisis to seize parts of the west   edit  2002 unity government In January 2003  Gbagbo and rebel leaders signed accords creating a  government of national unity   Curfews were lifted and French troops patrolled the western border of the country  The unity government was unstable and the central problems remained with neither side achieving its goals  In March 2004  120 people were killed in an opposition rally  and subsequent mob violence led to foreign nationals being evacuated  A later report concluded the killings were planned  Though UN peacekeepers were deployed to maintain a Zone of Confidence  relations between Gbagbo and the opposition continued to deteriorate  Early in November 2004  after the peace agreement had effectively collapsed following the rebels  refusal to disarm  Gbagbo ordered airstrikes against the rebels  During one of these airstrikes in Bouak   on 6 November 2004  French soldiers were hit and nine were killed  the Ivorian government has said it was a mistake  but the French have claimed it was deliberate  They responded by destroying most Ivoirian military aircraft  2 Su 25 planes and 5 helicopters   and violent retaliatory riots against the French broke out in Abidjan  29  Gbagbo s original mandate as president expired on 30 October 2005  but due to the lack of disarmament it was deemed impossible to hold an election  and therefore his term in office was extended for a maximum of one year  according to a plan worked out by the African Union  this plan was endorsed by the United Nations Security Council  30  With the late October deadline approaching in 2006  it was regarded as very unlikely that the election would be held by that point  and the opposition and the rebels rejected the possibility of another term extension for Gbagbo  31  The UN Security Council endorsed another one year extension of Gbagbo s term on 1 November 2006  however  the resolution provided for the strengthening of Prime Minister Charles Konan Banny s powers  Gbagbo said the next day that elements of the resolution deemed to be constitutional violations would not be applied  32  A peace accord between the government and the rebels  or New Forces  was signed on 4 March 2007  and subsequently Guillaume Soro  leader of the New Forces  became prime minister  These events have been seen by some observers as substantially strengthening Gbagbo s position  33   edit  2010 election Main article  Ivorian presidential election  2010 The presidential elections that should have been organized in 2005 were postponed until November 2010  The preliminary results announced by the Electoral Commission showed a loss for Gbagbo in favour of his rival  former prime minister Alassane Ouattara  The ruling FPI contested the results before the Constitutional Council  charging massive fraud in the northern departments controlled by the rebels of the Forces Nouvelles de C te d Ivoire  FNCI   These charges were contradicted by international observers  The report of the results led to severe tension and violent incidents  The Constitutional Council  which consists of Gbagbo supporters  declared the results of seven northern departments unlawful and that Gbagbo had won the elections with 51  of the vote  instead of Ouattara winning with 54   as reported by the Electoral Commission   After the inauguration of Gbagbo  Ouattara  recognized as the winner by most countries and the United Nations  organized an alternative inauguration  These events raised fears of a resurgence of the civil war  thousands of refugees have fled the country  34  The African Union sent Thabo Mbeki  former President of South Africa  to mediate the conflict  The UN Security Council adopted a common resolution recognising Alassane Ouattara as winner of the elections  based on the position of ECOWAS  Economic Community of West Africa States   ECOWAS suspended C te d Ivoire from all its decision making bodies 35  while the African Union also suspended the country s membership  36  In 2010  a Colonel of the

The presidential election led to the 2010 2011 Ivorian crisis and to the Second Ivorian Civil War  After months of unsuccessful negotiations and sporadic violence  the crisis entered a critical stage as Ouattara s forces seized control of most of the country  with Gbagbo entrenched in Abidjan  the country s largest city  International organizations reported numerous instances of human rights violations by both sides  In the city of Du kou   hundreds of people were estimated to have been killed  predominantly by advancing pro Ouattara militias  In nearby Blolequin  dozens of people were
