Scientist Writer Politician Signature Benjamin Franklin  January 17  1706  O S  January 6  1705 1     April 17  1790  was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States  A noted polymath  Franklin was a leading author  printer  political theorist  politician  postmaster  scientist  musician  inventor  satirist  civic activist  statesman  and diplomat  As a scientist  he was a major figure in the American Enlightenment and the history of physics for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity  He invented the lightning rod  bifocals  the Franklin stove  a carriage odometer  and the glass  armonica   He formed both the first public lending library in America and the first fire department in Pennsylvania  Franklin earned the title of  The First American  for his early and indefatigable campaigning for colonial unity  as an author and spokesman in London for several colonies  then as the first United States Ambassador to France  he exemplified the emerging American nation  2  Franklin was foundational in defining the American ethos as a marriage of the practical and democratic values of thrift  hard work  education  community spirit  self governing institutions  and opposition to authoritarianism both political and religious  with the scientific and tolerant values of the Enlightenment  In the words of historian Henry Steele Commager   In a Franklin could be merged the virtues of Puritanism without its defects  the illumination of the Enlightenment without its heat   3  To Walter Isaacson  this makes Franklin  the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential in inventing the type of society America would become   4  Franklin  always proud of his working class roots  became a successful newspaper editor and printer in Philadelphia  the leading city in the colonies  He was also partners with William Goddard and Joseph Galloway the three of whom published the Pennsylvania Chronicle  a newspaper that was known for its revolutionary sentiments and criticisms of the British monarchy in the American colonies  5  He became wealthy publishing Poor Richard s Almanack and The Pennsylvania Gazette  Franklin gained international renown as a scientist for his famous experiments in electricity and for his many inventions  especially the lightning rod  He played a major role in establishing the University of Pennsylvania and was elected the first president of the American Philosophical Society  Franklin became a national hero in America when he spearheaded the effort to have Parliament repeal the unpopular Stamp Act  An accomplished diplomat  he was widely admired among the French as American minister to Paris and was a major figure in the development of positive Franco American relations  For many years he was the British postmaster for the colonies  which enabled him to set up the first national communications network  He was active in community affairs  colonial and state politics  as well as national and international affairs  From 1785 to 1788  he served as governor of Pennsylvania  Toward the end of his life  he freed his slaves and became one of the most prominent abolitionists  His colorful life and legacy of scientific and political achievement  and status as one of America s most influential Founding Fathers  have seen Franklin honored on coinage and money  warships  the names of many towns  counties  educational institutions  namesakes  and companies  and more than two centuries after his death  countless cultural references  Contents 1 Ancestry 2 Early life 2 1 Common law marriage to

Portrait Gallery in Washington  D C  Franklin s father  Josiah Franklin was a tallow chandler  a soap maker and a candle maker  Josiah was born at Ecton  Northamptonshire  England  on December 23  1657  the son of Thomas Franklin  a blacksmith farmer  and Jane White  His mother  Abiah Folger  was born in Nantucket  Massachusetts  on August 15  1667  to Peter Folger  a miller and schoolteacher and his wife Mary Morrill  a former indentured servant  Josiah Franklin had 17 children with his two wives  He married his first wife  Anne Child  in about 1677 in Ecton and emigrated with her to Boston in 1683  they had three children before emigrating  and four after  After her death  Josiah was married to Abiah Folger on July 9  1689  in the Old South Meeting House by Samuel Willard  Benjamin  their eighth child  was Josiah Franklin s 15th child and tenth and last son  Ben Franklin s mother  Abiah Folger  was born into a Puritan family among those that fled to Massachusetts to establish a purified Congregationalist Christianity in New England  when King Charles I of England began persecuting Puritans  They sailed for Boston in 1635  Her father was  the sort of rebel destined to transform colonial America   6  as clerk of the court  he was jailed for disobeying the local magistrate in defense of middle class shopkeepers and artisans in conflict with wealthy landowners  Ben Franklin followed in his grandfather s footsteps in his battles against the wealthy Penn family that owned the Pennsylvania Colony  Early life Franklin s birthplace on Milk Street  Boston  Massachusetts Franklin s birthplace site directly across from Old South Meeting House on Milk Street is commemorated by a bust above the second floor facade of this building Benjamin Franklin was born on Milk Street  in Boston  Massachusetts  on January 17  1706 1  and baptized at Old South Meeting House  Josiah wanted Ben to attend school with the clergy  but only had enough money to send him to school for two years  He attended Boston Latin School but did not graduate  he continued his education through voracious reading  Although  his parents talked of the church as a career  7  for Franklin  his schooling ended when he was ten  He then worked for his father for a time and at 12 he became an apprentice to his brother James  a printer  who taught Ben the printing trade  When Ben was 15  James founded The New England Courant  which was the first truly independent newspaper in the colonies  When denied the chance to write a letter to the paper for publication  Franklin adopted the pseudonym of  Mrs  Silence Dogood   a middle aged widow   Mrs  Dogood  s letters were published  and became a subject of conversation around town  Neither James nor the Courant s readers were aware of the ruse  and James was unhappy with Ben when he discovered the popular correspondent was his younger brother  Franklin left his apprenticeship without permission  and in so doing became a fugitive  8  At age 17  Franklin ran away to Philadelphia  Pennsylvania  seeking a new start in a new city  When he first arrived he worked in several printer shops around town  However  he was not satisfied by the immediate prospects  After a few months  while working in a printing house  Franklin was convinced by Pennsylvania Governor Sir William Keith to go to London  ostensibly to acquire the equipment necessary for establishing another newspaper in Philadelphia  Finding Keith s promises of backing a newspaper to be empty  Franklin worked as a typesetter in a printer s shop in what is now the Church of St Bartholomew the Great in the Smithfield area of London  Following this  he returned to Philadelphia in 1726 with the help of Thomas Denham  a merchant who employed Franklin as clerk  shopkeeper  and bookkeeper in his business  8  In 1727  Benjamin Franklin  then 21  created the Junto  a group of  like minded aspiring artisans and tradesmen who hoped to improve themselves while they improved their community   The Junto was a discussion group for issues of the day  it subsequently gave rise to many organizations in Philadelphia  Reading was a great pastime of the Junto  but books were rare and expensive  The members created a library  initially assembled from their own books  This did not suffice  however  Franklin then conceived the idea of a subscription library  which would pool the funds of the members to buy books for all to read  This was the birth of the Library Company of Philadelphia  its charter was composed by Franklin in 1731  In 1732  Franklin hired the first American librarian  Louis Timothee  Originally  the books were kept in the homes of the first librarians  but in 1739 the collection was moved to the second floor of the State House of Pennsylvania  now known as Independence Hall  In 1791  a new building was built specifically for the library  The Library Company is now a great scholarly and research library with 500 000 rare books  pamphlets  and broadsides  more than 160 000 manuscripts  and 75 000 graphic items  Benjamin Franklin  center  at work on a printing press  Reproduction of a Charles Mills painting by the Detroit Publishing Company  Upon Denham s death  Franklin returned to his former trade  In 1728  Franklin had set up a printing house in partnership with Hugh Meredith and the following year became the publisher of a newspaper called The Pennsylvania Gazette  The Gazette gave Franklin a forum for agitation about a variety of local reforms and initiatives through printed essays and observations  Over time  his commentary  and his adroit cultivation of a positive image as an industrious and intellectual young man  earned him a great deal of social respect  But even after Franklin had achieved fame as a scientist and statesman  he habitually signed his letters with the unpretentious  B  Franklin  Printer   8  In 1731  Franklin was initiated into the local Masonic Lodge  He became Grand Master in 1734  indicating his rapid rise to prominence in Pennsylvania  9  10  That same year  he edited and published the first Masonic book in the Americas  a reprint of James Anderson s Constitutions of the Free Masons  Franklin remained a Freemason for the rest of his life  11  12  Common law marriage to Deborah Read Deborah Read Franklin  c  1759   Common law wife of Benjamin Franklin Sarah Franklin Bache  1743 1808   Daughter of Benjamin Franklin and Deborah Read At the age of 17  Franklin proposed to 15 year old Deborah Read while a boarder in the Read home  At that time  Read s mother was wary of allowing her young daughter to marry Franklin  who was on his way to London at Governor Sir William Keith s request  and also because of his financial instability  Her own husband had recently died  and Mrs  Read declined Franklin s request to marry her daughter  8  While Franklin was in London  his trip was extended  and there were problems with Sir William s promises of support  Perhaps because of the circumstances of this delay  Deborah married a man named John Rodgers  This proved to be a regrettable decision  Rodgers shortly avoided his debts and prosecution by fleeing to Barbados with her dowry  leaving Deborah behind  Rodgers s fate was unknown  and because of bigamy laws  Deborah was not free to remarry  Franklin established a common law marriage with Deborah Read on September 1  1730  and besides taking in Franklin s young  recently acknowledged illegitimate son  William  together they had two children  The first  Francis Folger Franklin  born October 1732  died of smallpox in 1736  Their second child  Sarah Franklin  familiarly called Sally  was born in 1743  She eventually married Richard Bache  had seven children  and cared for her father in his old age  Deborah s fear of the sea meant that she never accompanied Franklin on any of his extended trips to Europe  despite his repeated requests  However  Franklin did not leave London to visit Deborah even after she wrote to him in November 1769 saying her illness was due to  dissatisfied distress  from his prolonged absence  13  Deborah Read Franklin died of a stroke in 1774  while Franklin was on an extended trip to England  Illegitimate son William William Franklin In 1730  at the age of 24  Franklin publicly acknowledged an illegitimate son named William  14  who would eventually become the last Loyalist governor of New Jersey  While the identity of William s mother remains unknown  perhaps the responsibility of an infant child gave Franklin a reason to take up residence with Deborah Read  William was raised in the Franklin household but eventually broke with his father over opinions regarding the treatment of the colonies by the British government  The elder Franklin could never accept William s decision to declare his loyalty to the crown  Any hope of reconciliation was shattered when William Franklin became leader of The Board of Associated Loyalists a quasi military organization  headquartered in British occupied New York City  which  among other things  launched guerilla forays into New Jersey  southern Connecticut  and New York counties north of the city  15  In the preliminary peace talks in 1782 with Britain     Franklin insisted that loyalists who had borne arms against the United States would be excluded from this plea  that they be given a general pardon   He was undoubtedly thinking of William Franklin   16  William left New York along with the British troops  He settled in England  never to return  William Franklin himself had an illegitimate son  William Temple Franklin  Franklin s only patrilineal grandson  William Temple Franklin was born out of wedlock on February 22  1762 in Middlesex  His mother was not Elizabeth Downes  whom William later married  she has never been identified  Dr  Franklin insisted that his grandson be brought to Philadelphia  and he was raised there  Temple Franklin served as secretary to his grandfather during his mission to Paris during the Revolutionary War  He died there in 1823 and was buried in the famed P re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris  Success as an author In 1733  Franklin began to publish the famous Poor Richard s Almanack  with content both original and borrowed  under the pseudonym Richard Saunders  on which much of his popular reputation is based  Franklin frequently wrote under pseudonyms  Although it was no secret that Franklin was the author  his Richard Saunders character repeatedly denied it   Poor Richard s Proverbs   adages from this almanac  such as  A penny saved is twopence dear   often misquoted as  A penny saved is a penny earned   and  Fish and visitors stink in three days  remain common quotations in the modern world  Wisdom in folk society meant the ability to provide an apt adage for any occasion  and Franklin s readers became well prepared  He sold about ten thousand copies per year  a circulation equivalent to nearly three million today   8  In 1758  the year he ceased writing for the Almanack  he printed Father Abraham s Sermon  also known as The Way to Wealth  Franklin s autobiography  begun in 1771 but published after his death  has become one of the classics of the genre  Daylight saving time  DST  is often erroneously attributed to a 1784 satire that Franklin published anonymously  17  Modern DST was first proposed by George Vernon Hudson in 1895  18  Inventions and scientific inquiries Glass Armonica Franklin was a prodigious inventor  Among his many creations were the lightning rod  glass armonica  a glass instrument  not to be confused with the metal harmonica   Franklin stove  bifocal glasses and the flexible urinary catheter  Franklin never patented his inventions  in his autobiography he wrote       as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others  we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours  and this we should do freely and generously   19  His inventions also included social innovations  such as paying forward  Franklin s fascination with innovation could be viewed as altruistic  he wrote that his scientific works were to be used for increasing efficiency and human improvement  One such improvement was his effort to expedite news services through his printing presses  20  Atlantic Ocean currents As deputy postmaster  Franklin became interested in the North Atlantic Ocean circulation patterns  While in England in 1768 he heard a complaint from the Colonial Board of Customs  Why did it take British packet ships carrying mail several weeks longer to reach New York than it took an average merchant ship to reach Newport  Rhode Island   despite the merchantmen having a longer and more complex voyage because they left from London  while the packets left from Falmouth in Cornwall  Franklin put the question to his cousin Timothy Folger  a Nantucket whaler captain  who told him that merchant ships routinely avoided a strong eastbound mid ocean current while the mail packet captains sailed dead into it  thus fighting an adverse current of 3 miles per hour  5 km h   Franklin worked with Folger and other experienced ship captains  learning enough to chart the current and name it the Gulf Stream  by which it is still known today  Franklin published his Gulf Stream chart in 1770 in England  where it was completely ignored  Subsequent versions were printed in France in 1778 and the U S  in 1786  The British edition of the chart  which was the original  was so thoroughly ignored that everyone assumed it was lost forever until Phil Richardson  a Woods Hole Oceanographer and Gulf Stream expert  discovered it in Biblioth que Nationale in Paris in 1980  21  22  This find received front page coverage in the New York Times  23  It took many years for British sea captains finally to adopt Franklin s advice on navigating the current  once they did  they were able to trim two weeks from their sailing time  24  25  In 1853  oceanographer and cartographer Matthew Fontaine Maury reminded that Franklin only charted and codified the Gulf Stream  he did not actually discover it  Though it was Dr  Franklin and Captain Tim Folger  who first turned the Gulf Stream to nautical account  the discovery that there was a Gulf Stream cannot be said to belong to either of them  for its existence was known to Peter Martyr d Anghiera  and to Sir Humphrey Gilbert  in the 16th century  26  No longer a printer In 1743  Franklin founded the American Philosophical Society to help scientific men discuss their discoveries and theories  He began the electrical research that  along with other scientific inquiries  would occupy him for the rest of his life  in between bouts of politics and moneymaking  8  An illustration from Franklin s paper on  Water spouts and Whirlwinds   In 1747  he retired from printing and went into other businesses  27  He created a partnership with his foreman  David Hall  which provided Franklin with half of the shop s profits for 18 years  This lucrative business arrangement provided leisure time for study  and in a few years he had made discoveries that gave him a reputation with educated persons throughout Europe and especially in France  Electricity His discoveries resulted from his investigations of electricity  Franklin proposed that  vitreous  and  resinous  electricity were not different types of  electrical fluid   as electricity was called then   but the same electrical fluid under different pressures  He was the first to label them as positive and negative respectively  28  and he was the first to discover the principle of conservation of charge  29  In 1750 he published a proposal for an experiment to prove that lightning is electricity by flying a kite in a storm that appeared capable of becoming a lightning storm  On May 10  1752 Thomas Fran ois Dalibard of France conducted Franklin s experiment using a 40 foot  12 m  tall iron rod instead of a kite  and he extracted electrical sparks from a cloud  On June 15 Franklin may possibly have conducted his famous kite experiment in Philadelphia  successfully extracting sparks from a cloud  Franklin s experiment was not written up with credit 30  until Joseph Priestley s 1767 History and Present Status of Electricity  the evidence shows that Franklin was insulated  not in a conducting path  where he would have been in danger of electrocution   Others  such as Prof  Georg Wilhelm Richmann were indeed electrocuted during the months following Franklin s experiment  In his writings  Franklin indicates that he was aware of the dangers and offered alternative ways to demonstrate that lightning was electrical  as shown by his use of the concept of electrical ground  If Franklin did perform this experiment  he may not have done it in the way that is often described  flying the kite and waiting to be struck by lightning  as it could have been dangerous  31  Instead he used the kite to collect some electric charge from a storm cloud  which implied that lightning was electrical  citation needed  On October 19 in a letter to England explaining directions for repeating the experiment  Franklin wrote  When rain has wet the kite twine so that it can conduct the electric fire freely  you will find it streams out plentifully from the key at the approach of your knuckle  and with this key a phial  or Leiden jar  maybe charged  and from electric fire thus obtained spirits may be kindled  and all other electric experiments  may be  performed which are usually done by the help of a rubber glass globe or tube  and therefore the sameness of the electrical matter with that of lightening completely demonstrated  32  Franklin s electrical experiments led to his invention of the lightning rod  He noted that conductors with a sharp rather than a smooth point were capable of discharging silently  and at a far greater distance  He surmised that this knowledge could be of use in protecting buildings from lightning by attaching  upright Rods of Iron  made sharp as a Needle and gilt to prevent Rusting  and from the Foot of those Rods a Wire down the outside of the Building into the Ground    Would not these pointed Rods probably draw the Electrical Fire silently out of a Cloud before it came nigh enough to strike  and thereby secure us from that most sudden and terrible Mischief   Following a series of experiments on Franklin s own house  lightning rods were installed on the Academy of Philadelphia  later the University of Pennsylvania  and the Pennsylvania State House  later Independence Hall  in 1752  33  In recognition of his work with electricity  Franklin received the Royal Society s Copley Medal in 1753 and in 1756 he became one of the few 18th century Americans to be elected as a Fellow of the Society  The cgs unit of electric charge has been named after him  one franklin  Fr  is equal to one statcoulomb  Wave theory of light Franklin was  along with his contemporary Leonhard Euler  the only major scientist who supported Christiaan Huygens  wave theory of light  which was basically ignored by the rest of the scientific community  In the 18th century Newton s corpuscular theory was held to be true  only after Young s famous slit experiment  1803  were most scientists persuaded to believe Huygens  theory  34  Meteorology On October 21  1743  according to popular myth  a storm moving from the southwest denied Franklin the opportunity of witnessing a lunar eclipse  Franklin was said to have noted that the prevailing winds were actually from the northeast  contrary to what he had expected  In correspondence with his brother  Franklin learned that the same storm had not reached Boston until after the eclipse  despite the fact that Boston is to the northeast of Philadelphia  He deduced that storms do not always travel in the direction of the prevailing wind  a concept that greatly influenced meteorology  35  Concept of cooling Franklin noted a principle of refrigeration by observing that on a very hot day  he stayed cooler in a wet shirt in a breeze than he did in a dry one  To understand this phenomenon more clearly Franklin conducted experiments  In 1758 on a warm day in Cambridge  England  Franklin and fellow scientist John Hadley experimented by continually wetting the ball of a mercury thermometer with ether and using bellows to evaporate the ether  36  With each subsequent evaporation  the thermometer read a lower temperature  eventually reaching 7  F   14  C   Another thermometer showed the room temperature to be constant at 65  F  18  C   In his letter Cooling by Evaporation  Franklin noted that  one may see the possibility of freezing a man to death on a warm summer s day   Temperature s effect on electrical conductivity According to Michael Faraday  Franklin s experiments on the non conduction of ice are worth mentioning although the law of the general effect of liquefaction on electrolytes is not attributed to Franklin  37  However  as reported in 1836 by Prof  A  D  Bache of the University of Pennsylvania  the law of the effect of heat on the conduction of bodies otherwise non conductors  for example  glass  could be attributed to Franklin  Franklin writes      A certain quantity of heat will make some bodies good conductors  that will not otherwise conduct     and again      And water  though naturally a good conductor  will not conduct well when frozen into ice   38  Oceanography findings An aging Franklin accumulated all his oceanographic findings in Maritime Observations  published by the Philosophical Society s transactions in 1786  39  It contained ideas for sea anchors  catamaran hulls  watertight compartments  shipboard lightning rods and a soup bowl designed to stay stable in stormy weather  Economics Benjamin Franklin  in his capacity as a farmer  wrote at least one critique about the negative consequences of price controls  trade restrictions and subsidy of the poor  This is succinctly preserved in his letter to the London Chronicle published November 29  1766 titled  On the Price of Corn  and Management of the poor   40  Economics was only generally recognized as a science with the publishing of Adam Smith s The Wealth of Nations which was published 9 years later  41  Musical endeavors Franklin is known to have played the violin  the harp  and the guitar  He also composed music  notably a string quartet in early classical style  and invented a much improved version of the glass armonica  in which the glasses rotate on a shaft  with the player s fingers held steady  instead of the other way around  this version soon found its way to Europe  42  Chess Franklin was an avid chess player  He was playing chess by around 1733  making him the first chess player known by name in the American colonies  43  His essay on the  Morals of Chess  in Columbian magazine  in December 1786 is the second known writing on chess in America  43  This essay in praise of chess and prescribing a code of behavior for it has been widely reprinted and translated  44  45  46  47  He and a friend also used chess as a means of learning the Italian language  which both were studying  the winner of each game between them had the right to assign a task  such as parts of the Italian grammar to be learned by heart  to be performed by the loser before their next meeting  48  Franklin was posthumously inducted into the U S  Chess Hall of Fame in 1999  43  Public life Benjamin Franklin by Benjamin Wilson  1759  In 1736  Franklin created the Union Fire Company  one of the first volunteer firefighting companies in America  In the same year  he printed a new currency for New Jersey based on innovative anti counterfeiting techniques he had devised  Throughout his career  Franklin was an advocate for paper money  publishing A Modest Enquiry into the Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency in 1729  and his printer printed money  He was influential in the more restrained and thus successful monetary experiments in the Middle Colonies  which stopped deflation without causing excessive inflation  In 1766 he made a case for paper money to the British House of Commons  49  As he matured  Franklin began to concern himself more with public affairs  In 1743  he set forth a scheme for The Academy and College of Philadelphia  He was appointed president of the academy on November 13  1749  and it opened on August 13  1751  At its first commencement  on May 17  1757  seven men graduated  six with a Bachelor of Arts and one as Master of Arts  It was later merged with the University of the State of Pennsylvania to become the University of Pennsylvania  Franklin became involved in Philadelphia politics and rapidly progressed  In October 1748  he was selected as a councilman  in June 1749 he became a Justice of the Peace for Philadelphia  and in 1751 he was elected to the Pennsylvania Assembly  On August 10  1753  Franklin was appointed joint deputy postmaster general of North America  His most notable service in domestic politics was his reform of the postal system  with mail sent out every week  8  In 1751  Franklin and Dr  Thomas Bond obtained a charter from the Pennsylvania legislature to establish a hospital  Pennsylvania Hospital was the first hospital in what was to become the United States of America  Pennsylvania Hospital by William Strickland  1755 In 1753  both Harvard and Yale awarded him honorary degrees  50  In 1754  he headed the Pennsylvania delegation to the Albany Congress  This meeting of several colonies had been requested by the Board of Trade in England to improve relations with the Indians and defense against the French  Franklin proposed a broad Plan of Union for the colonies  While the plan was not adopted  elements of it found their way into the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution  In 1756  Franklin organized the Pennsylvania Militia  see  Associated Regiment of Philadelphia  under heading of Pennsylvania s 103rd Artillery and 111th Infantry Regiment at Continental Army   He used Tun Tavern as a gathering place to recruit a regiment of soldiers to go into battle against the Native American uprisings that beset the American colonies  Reportedly Franklin was elected  Colonel  of the Associated Regiment but declined the honor  Join  or Die  This political cartoon by Franklin urged the colonies to join together during the French and Indian War  Seven Years  War   Also in 1756  Franklin became a member of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts  Manufactures  amp  Commerce  now Royal Society of Arts or RSA  which had been founded in 1754   whose early meetings took place in coffee shops in London s Covent Garden district  close to Franklin s main residence in Craven Street  The Craven street residence is the only of his residences to survive  It opened to the public as the Benjamin Franklin House museum on January 17  2006  After his return to America  Franklin became the Society s Corresponding Member and remained closely connected with the Society  The RSA instituted a Benjamin Franklin Medal in 1956 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Franklin s birth and the 200th anniversary of his membership of the RSA  Sketch of the original Tun Tavern In 1757  he was sent to England by the Pennsylvania Assembly as a colonial agent to protest against the political influence of the Penn family  the proprietors of the colony  He remained there for five years  striving to end the proprietors  prerogative to overturn legislation from the elected Assembly  and their exemption from paying taxes on their land  His lack of influential allies in Whitehall led to the failure of this mission  Whilst in London  Franklin became involved in radical politics  He was a member of the Club of Honest Whigs  alongside thinkers such as Richard Price  the minister of Newington Green Unitarian Church who ignited the Revolution Controversy  During his stays at Craven Street between 1757 and 1775  Franklin developed a close friendship with his landlady  Margaret Stevenson and her circle of friends and relations  in particular her daughter Mary  who was more often known as Polly  In 1759  he visited Edinburgh with his son  and recalled his conversations there as  the densest happiness of my life   51  In February 1759  the University of St Andrews awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree and in October of the same year he was granted Freedom of the Borough of St  Andrews  52  In 1762  Oxford University awarded Franklin an honorary doctorate for his scientific accomplishments and from then on he went by  Doctor Franklin   He also managed to secure a post for his illegitimate son  William Franklin  as Colonial Governor of New Jersey  8  He also joined the influential Birmingham based Lunar Society with whom he regularly corresponded and on occasion  visited in Birmingham in the West Midlands  At this time  many members of the Pennsylvania Assembly were feuding with William Penn s heirs  who controlled the colony as proprietors  Franklin led the  anti proprietary party  in the struggle against the Penn family  and was elected Speaker of the Pennsylvania House in May 1764  His call for a change from proprietary to royal government was a rare political miscalculation  however  Pennsylvanians worried that such a move would endanger their political and religious freedoms  Because of these fears  and because of political attacks on his character  Franklin lost his seat in the October 1764 Assembly elections  The anti proprietary party dispatched Franklin to England to continue the struggle against the Penn family proprietorship  but during this visit  events would drastically change the nature of his mission  53  Europe years In London  Franklin opposed the 1765 Stamp Act  but when he was unable to prevent its passage  he made another political miscalculation and recommended a friend to the post of stamp distributor for Pennsylvania  Pennsylvanians were outraged  believing that he had supported the measure all along  and threatened to destroy his home in Philadelphia  Franklin soon learned of the extent of colonial resistance to the Stamp Act  and his testimony before the House of Commons led to its repeal  With this  Franklin suddenly emerged as the leading spokesman for American interests in England  He wrote popular essays on behalf of the colonies  and Georgia  New Jersey  and Massachusetts also appointed him as their agent to the Crown  53  Franklin

introduced to many influential scientists and politicians  and also to King Louis XV  54  While living in London in 1768  he developed a phonetic alphabet in A Scheme for a new Alphabet and a Reformed Mode of Spelling  This reformed alphabet discarded six letters Franklin regarded as redundant  c  j  q  w  x  and y   and substituted six new letters for sounds he felt lacked letters of their own  His new alphabet  however  never caught on and he eventually lost interest  55  In 1771  Franklin made short journeys through different parts of England  staying with Joseph Priestley at Leeds  Thomas Percival at Manchester and Dr  Darwin at Litchfield  56  Franklin belonged to a gentleman s club  designated  honest Whigs  by Franklin   which held stated meetings  and included members such as Richard Price and Andrew Kippis  He was also a corresponding member of the Lunar Society of Birmingham  which included such other scientific and industrial luminaries as Matthew Boulton  James Watt  Josiah Wedgewood and Erasmus Darwin  He had never been to Ireland before  and met and stayed with Lord Hillsborough  whom he believed was especially attentive  but of whom he noted that  all the plausible behaviour I have described is meant only  by patting and stroking the horse  to make him more patient  while the reins are drawn tighter  and the spurs set deeper into his sides   57  In Dublin  Franklin was invited to sit with the members of the Irish Parliament rather than in the gallery  He was the first American to be given this honor  56  While touring Ireland  he was moved by the level of poverty he saw  Ireland s economy was affected by the same trade regulations and laws of Britain that governed America  Franklin feared that America could suffer the same effects should Britain s  colonial exploitation  continue  58  In Scotland  he spent five days with Lord Kames near Stirling and stayed for three weeks with David Hume in Edinburgh  In 1773  Franklin published two of his most celebrated pro American satirical essays  Rules by Which a Great Empire May Be Reduced to a Small One  and An Edict by the King of Prussia  59  He also published an Abridgment of the Book of Common Prayer  anonymously with Francis Dashwood  Among the unusual features of this work is a funeral service reduced to six minutes in length   to preserve the health and lives of the living   54  Hutchinson letters Main article  Hutchinson Letters Affair Franklin obtained private letters of Massachusetts governor Thomas Hutchinson and lieutenant governor Andrew Oliver that proved they were encouraging London to crack down on the rights of Bostonians  Franklin sent them to America where they escalated the tensions  Franklin now appeared to the British as the fomenter of serious trouble  Hopes for a peaceful solution ended as he was systematically ridiculed and humiliated by Solicitor General Alexander Wedderburn  before the Privy Council on January 29  1774  60  He left London in March 1775  54  Coming of Revolution In 1763  soon after Franklin returned to Pennsylvania  the western frontier was engulfed in a bitter war known as Pontiac s Rebellion  The Paxton Boys  a group of settlers convinced that the Pennsylvania government was not doing enough to protect them from American Indian raids  murdered a group of peaceful Susquehannock Indians and then marched on Philadelphia  Franklin helped to organize a local militia to defend the capital against the mob  and then met with the Paxton leaders and persuaded them to disperse  Franklin wrote a scathing attack against the racial prejudice of the Paxton Boys   If an Indian injures me   he asked   does it follow that I may revenge that Injury on all Indians   61  Declaration of Independence John Trumbull depicts the Committee of Five presenting their work to the Congress  62  By the time Franklin arrived in Philadelphia on May 5  1775  the American Revolution had begun with fighting at Lexington and Concord  The New England militia had trapped the main British army in Boston  The Pennsylvania Assembly unanimously chose Franklin as their delegate to the Second Continental Congress  In June 1776  he was appointed a member of the Committee of Five that drafted the Declaration of Independence  Although he was temporarily disabled by gout and unable to attend most meetings of the Committee  Franklin made several small changes to the draft sent to him by Thomas Jefferson  54  At the signing  he is quoted as having replied to a comment by Hancock that they must all hang together   Yes  we must  indeed  all hang together  or most assuredly we shall all hang separately   63  Postmaster Benjamin Franklin The first US postage stamp  1847 On July 26  1775  the Second Continental Congress established the United States Post Office and named Benjamin Franklin as the first United States Postmaster General  Franklin had been a postmaster for decades and was a natural choice for the position  64  Franklin had just returned from England and was appointed chairman of a Committee of Investigation to establish a postal system  The report of the Committee  providing for the appointment of a postmaster general for the 13 American colonies  was considered by the Continental Congress on July 25 and 26  On July 26  1775  Franklin was appointed Postmaster General  the first appointed under the Continental Congress  It established a postal system that became the United States Post Office  a system that is still in use today  65  Ambassador to France  1776 1785 Franklin  in his fur hat  charmed the French with what they saw as rustic new world genius  66  In December 1776  Franklin was dispatched to France as commissioner for the United States  He lived in a home in the Parisian suburb of Passy  donated by Jacques Donatien Le Ray de Chaumont who supported the United States  Franklin remained in France until 1785  He conducted the affairs of his country towards the French nation with great success  which included securing a critical military alliance in 1778 and negotiating the Treaty of Paris  1783   Among his associates in France was Honor  Gabriel Riqueti  comte de Mirabeau a French Revolutionary writer  orator and statesman who in early 1791 would be elected president of the National Assembly  In July 1784  Franklin met with Mirabeau and contributed anonymous materials Mirabeau used in the first work to which Mirabeau signed his name Considerations sur l ordre de Cincinnatus  67  The publication was critical of the Society of the Cincinnati  viewed by Franklin and Mirabeau as a  noble order  inconsistent with egalitarian ideals  68  During his stay in France  Benjamin Franklin was active as a freemason  serving as Grand Master of the Lodge Les Neuf S urs from 1779 until 1781  His number was 24 in the Lodge  He was also a Past Grand Master of Pennsylvania  In 1784  when Franz Mesmer began to publicize his theory of  animal magnetism   which was considered offensive by many  Louis XVI appointed a commission to investigate it  These included the chemist Antoine Lavoisier  the physician Joseph Ignace Guillotin  the astronomer Jean Sylvain Bailly  and Benjamin Franklin  69  Franklin s advocacy for religious tolerance in France contributed to arguments made by French philosophers and politicians that lead to the signing of the Edict of Versailles by Louis XVI in November 1787  This edict effectively nullified the Edict of Fontainebleau that had denied non Catholics civil status and the right to openly practice their faiths  70  Franklin also served as American minister to Sweden  although he never visited that country  He negotiated a treaty that was signed in April 1783  On August 27  1783 in Paris  Franklin witnessed the world s first hydrogen balloon flight  71 Le Globe  created by professor Jacques Charles and Les Fr res Robert  was watched by a vast crowd as it launched from the Champ de Mars  now the site of the Eiffel Tower   72  This so enthused Franklin that he subscribed financially to the next project to build a manned hydrogen balloon  73  On December 1  1783 Franklin was seated in the special enclosure for honoured guests when La Charli re took off from the Jardin des Tuileries  piloted by Jacques Charles and Nicolas Louis Robert  71  74  Constitutional Convention Franklin s return to Philadelphia  1785  by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris  When he finally returned home in 1785  Franklin occupied a position only second to that of George Washington as the champion of American independence  Le Ray honored him with a commissioned portrait painted by Joseph Duplessis that now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington  D C  After his return  Franklin became an abolitionist  freeing both of his slaves  He eventually became president of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society  75  In 1787  Franklin served as a delegate to the Philadelphia Convention  He held an honorary position and seldom engaged in debate  He is the only Founding Father who is a signatory of all four of the major documents of the founding of the United States  the Declaration of Independence  the Treaty of Paris  the Treaty of Alliance with France  and the United States Constitution  In 1787  a group of prominent ministers in Lancaster  Pennsylvania  proposed the foundation of a new college to be named in Franklin s honor  Franklin donated  200 towards the development of Franklin College  which is now called Franklin  amp  Marshall College  Between 1771 and 1788  he finished his autobiography  While it was at first addressed to his son  it was later completed for the benefit of mankind at the request of a friend  In his later years  as Congress was forced to deal with the issue of slavery  Franklin wrote several essays that attempted to convince his readers of the importance of the abolition of slavery and of the integration of blacks into American society  These writings included  An Address to the Public   1789  A Plan for Improving the Condition of the Free Blacks  1789   and Sidi Mehemet Ibrahim on the Slave Trade  1790   In 1790  Quakers from New York and Pennsylvania presented their petition for abolition  Their argument against slavery was backed by the Pennsylvania Abolitionist Society and its president  Benjamin Franklin  President of Pennsylvania Special balloting conducted October 18  1785 unanimously elected Franklin the sixth President of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania  replacing John Dickinson  The office of President of Pennsylvania was analogous to the modern position of Governor  It is not clear why Dickinson needed to be replaced with less than two weeks remaining before the regular election  Franklin held that office for slightly over three years  longer than any other  and served the Constitutional limit of three full terms  Shortly after his initial election he was reelected to a full term on October 29  1785  and again in the fall of 1786 and on October 31  1787  Officially  his term concluded on November 5  1788  but there is some question regarding the de facto end of his term  suggesting that the aging Franklin may not have been actively involved in the day to day operation of the Council toward the end of his time in office  Virtue  religion  and personal beliefs A bust of Franklin by Jean Antoine Houdon Like the other advocates of republicanism  Franklin emphasized that the new republic could survive only if the people were virtuous  All his life he explored the role of civic and personal virtue  as expressed in Poor Richard s aphorisms  Franklin felt that organized religion was necessary to keep men good to their fellow men  but rarely attended religious services himself  76  When Franklin met Voltaire in Paris and asked this great apostle of the Enlightenment to bless his grandson  Voltaire said in English   God and Liberty   and added   this is the only appropriate benediction for the grandson of Monsieur Franklin   77  Franklin s parents were both pious Puritans  78  The family attended the old South Church  the most liberal Puritan congregation in Boston  where Benjamin Franklin was baptized in 1706  79  Franklin s father  a poor chandler  owned a copy of a book  Bonifacius  Essays to Do Good  by the Puritan preacher and family friend Cotton Mather  which Franklin often cited as a key influence on his life  80  Franklin s first pen name  Silence Dogood  paid homage both to the book and to a famous sermon by Mather  The book preached the importance of forming voluntary associations to benefit society  Franklin learned about forming do good associations from Cotton Mather  but his organizational skills made him the most influential force in making voluntarism an enduring part of the American ethos  81  Franklin formulated a presentation of his beliefs and published it in 1728  82  It did not mention many of the Puritan ideas as regards belief in salvation  the divinity of Jesus  and indeed most religious dogma  He clarified himself as a deist in his 1771 autobiography  83  although he still considered himself a Christian  84  He retained a strong faith in a God as the wellspring of morality and goodness in man  and as a Providential actor in history responsible for American independence  85  It was Ben Franklin who  at a critical impasse during the Constitutional Convention in June 1787  attempted to introduce the practice of daily common prayer with these words       In the beginning of the contest with G  Britain  when we were sensible of danger we had daily prayer in this room for the Divine Protection    Our prayers  Sir  were heard  and they were graciously answered  All of us who were engaged in the struggle must have observed frequent instances of a Superintending providence in our favor      And have we now forgotten that powerful friend  or do we imagine that we no longer need His assistance  I have lived  Sir  a long time and the longer I live  the more convincing proofs I see of this truth   that God governs in the affairs of men  And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice  is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid  We have been assured  Sir  in the sacred writings that  except the Lord build they labor in vain that build it   I firmly believe this  and I also believe that without his concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better than the Builders of Babel     I therefore beg leave to move   that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of Heaven  and its blessings on our deliberations  be held in this Assembly every morning before we proceed to business  and that one or more of the Clergy of this City be requested to officiate in that service  86  However  the motion met with resistance and was never brought to a vote  87  Franklin was an enthusiastic supporter of the evangelical minister George Whitefield during the First Great Awakening  Franklin did not subscribe to Whitefield s theology  but he admired Whitefield for exhorting people to worship God through good works  Franklin published all of Whitefield s sermons and journals  thereby boosting the Great Awakening  88  When he stopped attending church  Franklin wrote in his autobiography     Sunday being my studying day  I never was without some religious principles  I never doubted  for instance  the existence of the Deity  that He made the world  and governed it by His providence  that the most acceptable service of God was the doing good to man  that our souls are immortal  and that all crime will be punished  and virtue rewarded  either here or hereafter  89  90  Franklin retained a lifelong commitment to the Puritan virtues and political values he had grown up with  and through his civic work and publishing  he succeeded in passing these values into the American culture permanently  He had a  passion for virtue   91  These Puritan values included his devotion to egalitarianism  education  industry  thrift  honesty  temperance  charity and community spirit  92  The classical authors read in the Enlightenment period taught an abstract ideal of republican government based on hierarchical social orders of king  aristocracy and commoners  It was widely believed that English liberties relied on their balance of power  but also hierarchal deference to the privileged class  93   Puritanism     and the epidemic evangelism of the mid eighteenth century  had created challenges to the traditional notions of social stratification  cite this quote  by preaching that the Bible taught all men are equal  that the true value of a man lies in his moral behavior  not his class  and that all men can be saved  94  Franklin  steeped in Puritanism and an enthusiastic supporter of the evangelical movement  rejected the salvation dogma  but embraced the radical notion of egalitarian democracy  Franklin s commitment to teach these values was itself something he gained from his Puritan upbringing  with its stress on  inculcating virtue and character in themselves and their communities   95  These Puritan values and the desire to pass them on  were one of Franklin s quintessentially American characteristics  and helped shape the character of the nation  Franklin s writings on virtue were derided by some European authors  such as Jackob Fugger in his critical work Portrait of American Culture  Max Weber considered Franklin s ethical writings a culmination of the Protestant ethic  which ethic created the social conditions necessary for the birth of capitalism  96  One of Franklin s famous characteristics was his respect  tolerance and promotion of all churches  Referring to his experience in Philadelphia  he wrote in his autobiography   new Places of worship were continually wanted  and generally erected by voluntary Contribution  my Mite for such purpose  whatever might be the Sect  was never refused   89   He helped create a new type of nation that would draw strength from its religious pluralism   97  The first generation of Puritans had been intolerant of dissent  but by the early 18th century  when Franklin grew up in the Puritan church  tolerance of different churches was the norm  and Massachusetts was known  in John Adams  words  as   the most mild and equitable establishment of religion that was known in the world    98  The evangelical revivalists who were active mid century  such as Franklin s friend and preacher  George Whitefield  were the greatest advocates of religious freedom   claiming liberty of conscience to be an  inalienable right of every rational creature    99  Whitefield s supporters in Philadelphia  including Franklin  erected  a large  new hall  that   could provide a pulpit to anyone of any belief   100  Franklin s rejection of dogma and doctrine and his stress on the God of ethics and morality and civic virtue  made him the  prophet of tolerance   101  While he was living in London in 1774  he was present at the birth of British Unitarianism  attending the inaugural session of the Essex Street Chapel  at which Theophilus Lindsey drew together the first avowedly Unitarian congregation in England  this was somewhat politically risky  and pushed religious tolerance to new boundaries  as a denial of the doctrine of the Trinity was illegal until the 1813 Act  102  Although Franklin s parents had intended for him to have a career in the Church  7  Franklin as a young man adopted the Enlightenment religious belief in deism  that God s truths can be found entirely through nature and reason  103   I soon became a thorough Deist   104  As a young man he rejected Christian dogma in a 1725 pamphlet A Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity  Pleasure and Pain  105  which he later saw as an embarrassment  106  while simultaneously asserting that God is  all wise  all good  all powerful   106  He defended his rejection of religious dogma with these words   I think opinions should be judged by their influences and effects  and if a man holds none that tend to make him less virtuous or more vicious  it may be concluded that he holds none that are dangerous  which I hope is the case with me   After the disillusioning experience of seeing the decay in his own moral standards  and those of two friends in London whom he had converted to Deism  Franklin turned back to a belief in the importance of organized religion  on the pragmatic grounds that without God and organized churches  man will not be good  107  Moreover  because of his proposal that prayers be said in the Constitutional Convention of 1787  many have contended that in his later life  Franklin became a pious Christian  108  109  At one point  he wrote to Thomas Paine  criticizing his manuscript  The Age of Reason  For without the Belief of a Providence that takes Cognizance of  guards and guides and may favour particular Persons  there is no Motive to Worship a Deity  to fear its Displeasure  or to pray for its Protection    think how great a Proportion of Mankind consists of weak and ignorant Men and Women  and of inexperienc d and inconsiderate Youth of both Sexes  who have need of the Motives of Religion to restrain them from Vice  to support their Virtue  and retain them in the Practice of it till it becomes habitual  which is the great Point for its Security  And perhaps you are indebted to her originally that is to your Religious Education  for the Habits of Virtue upon which you now justly value yourself  If men are so wicked with religion  what would they be if without it  110  According to David Morgan  111  Franklin was a proponent of religion in general  He prayed to  Powerful Goodness  and referred to God as  the infinite   John Adams noted that Franklin was a mirror in which people saw their own religion   The Catholics thought him almost a Catholic  The Church of England claimed him as one of them  The Presbyterians thought him half a Presbyterian  and the Friends believed him a wet Quaker   Whatever else Franklin was  concludes Morgan   he was a true champion of generic religion   In a letter to Richard Price  Franklin stated that he believed that religion should support itself without help from the government  claiming   When a Religion is good  I conceive that it will support itself  and  when it cannot support itself  and God does not take care to support  so that its Professors are oblig d to call for the help of the Civil Power  it is a sign  I apprehend  of its being a bad one   112  In 1790  just about a month before he died  Franklin wrote a letter to Ezra Stiles  president of Yale University  who had asked him his views on religion  As to Jesus of Nazareth  my Opinion of whom you particularly desire  I think the System of Morals and his Religion  as he left them to us  the best the world ever saw or is likely to see  but I apprehend it has received various corrupt changes  and I have  with most of the present Dissenters in England  some Doubts as to his divinity  tho  it is a question I do not dogmatize upon  having never studied it  and I think it needless to busy myself with it now  when I expect soon an Opportunity of knowing the Truth with less Trouble     8  On July 4  1776  Congress appointed a three member committee composed of Franklin  Thomas Jefferson  and John Adams to design the Great Seal of the United States  Franklin s proposal  which was not adopted  featured the motto   Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God  and a scene from the Book of Exodus  with Moses  the Israelites  the pillar of fire  and George III depicted as pharaoh  The design that was produced was never acted upon by Congress and the Great Seal s design was not finalized until a third committee was appointed in 1782  113  114  Thirteen Virtues Franklin bust in the Archives Department of Columbia University in New York City Franklin sought to cultivate his character by a plan of 13 virtues  which he developed at age 20  in 1726  and continued to practice in some form for the rest of his life  His autobiography lists his 13 virtues as   Temperance  Eat not to dullness  drink not to elevation    Silence  Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself  avoid trifling conversation    Order  Let all your things have their places  let each part of your business have its time    Resolution  Resolve to perform what you ought  perform without fail what you resolve    Frugality  Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself  i e   waste nothing    Industry  Lose no time  be always employ d in something useful  cut off all unnecessary actions    Sincerity  Use no hurtful deceit  think innocently and justly  and  if you speak  speak accordingly    Justice  Wrong none by doing injuries  or omitting the benefits that are your duty    Moderation  Avoid extremes  forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve    Cleanliness  Tolerate no uncleanliness in body  cloaths  or habitation    Tranquility  Be not disturbed at trifles  or at accidents common or unavoidable    Chastity  Rarely use venery but for health or offspring  never to dullness  weakness  or the injury of your own or another s peace or reputation    Humility  Imitate Jesus and Socrates   Franklin did not try to work on them all at once  Instead  he would work on one and only one each week  leaving all others to their ordinary chance   While Franklin did not live completely by his virtues and by his own admission  he fell short of them many times  he believed the attempt made him a better man contributing greatly to his success and happiness  which is why in his autobiography  he devoted more pages to this plan than to any other single point  in his autobiography Franklin wrote   I hope  therefore  that some of my descendants may follow the example and reap the benefit   115  Franklin on U S  Postage Benjamin Franklin is a prominent figure in American history comparable to Washington  Jefferson and Lincoln and as such he has been honored on US Postage stamps many times  The image of Franklin  the first Postmaster General of the United States  occurs on the face of U S  Postage more than any other notable American  save that of George Washington  116  Franklin appeared on the first U S  postage stamp  displayed above  issued in 1847  From 1908 through 1923 the U S  Post Office issued a series of postage stamps commonly referred to as the Washington Franklin Issues where  along with George Washington  Franklin was depicted many times over a 14 year period  the longest run of any one series in US postal history  Along with the regular issue stamps Franklin however only appears on a few commemorative stamps  Some of the finest portrayals of Franklin on record can be found on the engravings inscribed on the face of US postage  116  Issue of 1861 Issue of 1895 Issue of

the 250th anniversary of his birth in 1956 Franklin died on April 17  1790  at age 84  Approximately 20 000 people attended his funeral  He was interred in Christ Church Burial Ground in Philadelphia  In 1728  aged 22  Franklin wrote what he hoped would be his own epitaph  The Body of B  Franklin Printer  Like the Cover of an old Book  Its Contents torn out  And stript of its Lettering and Gilding  Lies here  Food for Worms  But the Work shall not be wholly lost  For it will  as he believ d  appear once more  In a new  amp  more perfect Edition  Corrected and Amended By the Author  117  Franklin s actual grave  however  as he specified in his final will  simply reads  Benjamin and Deborah Franklin   118  In 1773  when Franklin s work had moved from printing to science and politics  he corresponded with a French scientist  Jacques Barbeu Dubourg  on the subject of preserving the dead for later revival by more advanced scientific methods  writing  I should prefer to an ordinary death  being immersed with a few friends in a cask of Madeira  until that time  then to be recalled to life by the solar warmth of my dear country  But in all probability  we live in a century too little advanced  and too near the infancy of science  to see such an art brought in our time to its perfection  119   Extended excerpt also online   120  His death is described in the book The Life of Benjamin Franklin  quoting from the account of Dr  John Jones     when the pain and difficulty of breathing entirely left him  and his family were flattering themselves with the hopes of his recovery  when an imposthume  which had formed itself in his lungs  suddenly burst  and discharged a quantity of matter  which he continued to throw up while he had power  but  as that failed  the organs of respiration became gradually oppressed  a calm  lethargic state succeeded  and on the 17th instant  April 1790   about eleven o clock at night  he quietly expired  closing a long and useful life of eighty four years and three months  121  A signer of both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution  Franklin is considered one of the Founding Fathers of the U S  His pervasive influence in the early history of the United States has led to his being jocularly called  the only President of the United States who was never President of the United States   122  Franklin s likeness is ubiquitous  Since 1928  it has adorned American  100 bills  which are sometimes referred to in slang as  Benjamins  or  Franklins   From 1948 to 1963  Franklin s portrait was on the half dollar  He has appeared on a  50 bill and on several varieties of the  100 bill from 1914 and 1918  Franklin appears on the  1 000 Series EE Savings bond  The city of Philadelphia contains around 5 000 likenesses of Benjamin Franklin  about half of which are located on the University of Pennsylvania campus  Philadelphia s Benjamin Franklin Parkway  a major thoroughfare  and Benjamin Franklin Bridge  the first major bridge to connect Philadelphia with New Jersey  are named in his honor  In 1976  as part of a bicentennial celebration  Congress dedicated a 20 foot  6 m  marble statue in Philadelphia s Franklin Institute as the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial  Many of Franklin s personal possessions are also on display at the Institute  one of the few national memorials located on private property  In London  his house at 36 Craven Street was first marked with a blue plaque and has since been opened to the public as the Benjamin Franklin House  123  In 1998  workmen restoring the building dug up the remains of six children and four adults hidden below the home  The Times reported on February 11  1998  Initial estimates are that the bones are about 200 years old and were buried at the time Franklin was living in the house  which was his home from 1757 to 1762 and from 1764 to 1775  Most of the bones show signs of having been dissected  sawn or cut  One skull has been drilled with several holes  Paul Knapman  the Westminster Coroner  said yesterday   I cannot totally discount the possibility of a crime  There is still a possibility that I may have to hold an inquest   The Friends of Benjamin Franklin House  the organization responsible for the restoration  note that the bones were likely placed there by William Hewson  who lived in the house for two years and who had built a small anatomy school at the back of the house  They note that while Franklin likely knew what Hewson was doing  he probably did not participate in any dissections because he was much more of a physicist than a medical man  124  Bequest Franklin bequeathed  1 000  about  4 400 at the time  or about  55 000 in 2010 dollars citation needed   each to the cities of Boston and Philadelphia  in trust to gather interest for 200 years  The trust began in 1785 when the French mathematician Charles Joseph Mathon de la Cour  who admired Franklin greatly  wrote a friendly parody of Franklin s  Poor Richard s Almanack  called  Fortunate Richard   The main character leaves a smallish amount of money in his will  five lots of 100 livres  to collect interest over one  two  three  four or five full centuries  with the resulting astronomical sums to be spent on impossibly elaborate utopian projects  125  Franklin  who was 79 years old at the time  wrote thanking him for a great idea and telling him that he had decided to leave a bequest of 1 000 pounds each to his native Boston and his adopted Philadelphia  As of 1990  more than  2 000 000 had accumulated in Franklin s Philadelphia trust  which had loaned the money to local residents  From 1940 to 1990  the money was used mostly for mortgage loans  When the trust came due  Philadelphia decided to spend it on scholarships for local high school students  Franklin s Boston trust fund accumulated almost  5 000 000 during that same time  at the end of its first 100 years a portion was allocated to help establish a trade school that became the Franklin Institute of Boston and the whole fund was later dedicated to supporting this institute  126  127  Exhibitions  The Princess and the Patriot  Ekaterina Dashkova  Benjamin

and Dashkova was 37  Franklin invited Dashkova to become the first woman to join the American Philosophical Society and the only woman to be so honored for another 80 years  Later  Dashkova reciprocated by making him the first American member of the Russian Academy of Sciences  Places and things named after Benjamin Franklin Further information  List of places named for Benjamin Franklin
