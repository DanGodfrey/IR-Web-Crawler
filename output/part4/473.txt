Pure gold has a bright yellow color and luster traditionally considered attractive  which it maintains without oxidizing in air or water  Chemically  gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element  It is one of the least reactive solid chemical elements  The metal therefore occurs often in free elemental  native  form  as nuggets or grains in rocks  in veins and in alluvial deposits  Less commonly  it occurs in minerals as gold compounds  usually with tellurium  Gold resists attacks by individual acids  but it can be dissolved by the aqua regia  nitro hydrochloric acid   so named because it dissolves gold  Gold also dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide  which have been used in mining  Gold dissolves in mercury  forming amalgam alloys  Gold is insoluble in nitric acid  which dissolves silver and base metals  a property that has long been used to confirm the presence of gold in items  giving rise to the term the acid test  Gold has been a valuable and highly sought after precious metal for coinage  jewelry  and other arts since long before the beginning of recorded history  Gold standards have been the most common basis for monetary policies throughout human history  being widely supplanted by fiat currency only in the late 20th century  Gold has also been frequently linked to a wide variety of symbolisms and ideologies  A total of 165 000 tonnes of gold have been mined in human history  as of 2009  2  This is roughly equivalent to 5 3 billion troy ounces or  in terms of volume  about 8500 m3  or a cube 20 4 m on a side  The world consumption of new gold produced is about 50  in jewelry  40  in investments  and 10  in industry  3  Besides its widespread monetary and symbolic functions  gold has many practical uses in dentistry  electronics  and other fields  Its high malleability  ductility  resistance to corrosion and most other chemical reactions  and conductivity of electricity led to many uses of gold  including electric wiring  colored glass production and even gold leaf eating  Contents 1 Characteristics 1 1 Color 1 2 Isotopes 2 Use and applications 2 1 Monetary exchange 2 2 Investment 2 3 Jewelry 2 4 Medicine 2 5 Food and drink 2

gram can be beaten into a sheet of 1 square meter  or an ounce into 300 square feet  Gold leaf can be beaten thin enough to become transparent  The transmitted light appears greenish blue  because gold strongly reflects yellow and red  4  Such semi transparent sheets also strongly reflect infrared light  making them useful as infrared  radiant heat  shields in visors of heat resistant suits  and in sun visors for spacesuits  5  Gold readily creates alloys with many other metals  These alloys can be produced to modify the hardness and other metallurgical properties  to control melting point or to create exotic colors  see below   6  Gold is a good conductor of heat and electricity and reflects infrared radiation strongly  Chemically  it is unaffected by air  moisture and most corrosive reagents  and is therefore well suited for use in coins and jewelry and as a protective coating on other  more reactive  metals  However  it is not chemically inert  Common oxidation states of gold include  1  gold I  or aurous compounds  and  3  gold III  or auric compounds   Gold ions in solution are readily reduced and precipitated out as gold metal by adding any other metal as the reducing agent  The added metal is oxidized and dissolves allowing the gold to be displaced from solution and be recovered as a solid precipitate  High quality pure metallic gold is tasteless and scentless  in keeping with its resistance to corrosion  it is metal ions which confer taste to metals   7  In addition  gold is very dense  a cubic meter weighing 19 300 kg  By comparison  the density of lead is 11 340 kg m3  and that of the densest element  osmium  is 22 610 kg m3  Color Different colors of Ag Au Cu alloys Whereas most other pure metals are gray or silvery white  gold is yellow  This color is determined by the density of loosely bound  valence  electrons  those electrons oscillate as a collective  plasma  medium described in terms of a quasiparticle called plasmon  The frequency of these oscillations lies in the ultraviolet range for most metals  but it falls into the visible range for gold due to subtle relativistic effects that affect the orbitals around gold atoms  8  9  Similar effects impart a golden hue to metallic caesium  see relativistic quantum chemistry   Common colored gold alloys such as rose gold can be created by the addition of various amounts of copper and silver  as indicated in the triangular diagram to the left  Alloys containing palladium or nickel are also important in commercial jewelry as these produce white gold alloys  Less commonly  addition of manganese  aluminium  iron  indium and other elements can produce more unusual colors of gold for various applications  6  Isotopes Main article  Isotopes of gold Gold has only one stable isotope  197Au  which is also its only naturally occurring isotope  Thirty six radioisotopes have been synthesized ranging in atomic mass from 169 to 205  The most stable of these is 195Au with a half life of 186 1 days  The least stable is 171Au  which decays by proton emission with a half life of 30  s  Most of gold s radioisotopes with atomic masses below 197 decay by some combination of proton emission    decay  and    decay  The exceptions are 195Au  which decays by electron capture  and 196Au  which decays most often by electron capture  93   with a minor    decay path  7    10  All of gold s radioisotopes with atomic masses above 197 decay by    decay  11  At least 32 nuclear isomers have also been characterized  ranging in atomic mass from 170 to 200  Within that range  only 178Au  180Au  181Au  182Au  and 188Au do not have isomers  Gold s most stable isomer is 198m2Au with a half life of 2 27 days  Gold s least stable isomer is 177 m2Au with a half life of only 7 ns  184 m1Au has three decay paths     decay  isomeric transition  and alpha decay  No other isomer or isotope of gold has three decay paths  11  Use and applications Monetary exchange Gold has been widely used throughout the world as a vehicle for monetary exchange  either by issuance and recognition of gold coins or other bare metal quantities  or through gold convertible paper instruments by establishing gold standards in which the total value of issued money is represented in a store of gold reserves  However  production has not grown in relation to the world s economies  Today  gold mining output is declining  12  With the sharp growth of economies in the 20th century  and increasing foreign exchange  the world s gold reserves and their trading market have become a small fraction of all markets and fixed exchange rates of currencies to gold were no longer sustained  At the beginning of World War I the warring nations moved to a fractional gold standard  inflating their currencies to finance the war effort  After World War II gold was replaced by a system of convertible currency following the Bretton Woods system  Gold standards and the direct convertibility of currencies to gold have been abandoned by world governments  being replaced by fiat currency in their stead  Switzerland was the last country to tie its currency to gold  it backed 40  of its value until the Swiss joined the International Monetary Fund in 1999  13  Pure gold is too soft for day to day monetary use and is typically hardened by alloying with copper  silver or other base metals  The gold content of alloys is measured in carats  k   Pure gold is designated as 24k  English gold coins intended for circulation from 1526 into the 1930s were typically a standard 22k alloy called crown gold  for hardness  American gold coins for circulation after 1837 contained the slightly lower amount of 0 900 fine gold  or 21 6 kt   Investment Main article  Gold as an investment Gold Price per gram between Jan 1971 and Jan 2012  The graph shows nominal price in US Dollars  the price in 1971 and 2011 US Dollars Many holders of gold store it in form of bullion coins or bars as a hedge against inflation or other economic disruptions  However  some economists do not believe gold serves as a hedge against inflation or currency depreciation  14  The ISO 4217 currency code of gold is XAU  Modern bullion coins for investment or collector purposes do not require good mechanical wear properties  they are typically fine gold at 24k  although the American Gold Eagle  the British gold sovereign  and the South African Krugerrand continue to be minted in 22k metal in historical tradition  The special issue Canadian Gold Maple Leaf coin contains the highest purity gold of any bullion coin  at 99 999  or 0 99999  while the popular issue Canadian Gold Maple Leaf coin has a purity of 99 99   Several other 99 99  pure gold coins are available  In 2006  the United States Mint began production of the American Buffalo gold bullion coin with a purity of 99 99   The Australian Gold Kangaroos were first coined in 1986 as the Australian Gold Nugget but changed the reverse design in 1989  Other popular modern coins include the Austrian Vienna Philharmonic bullion coin and the Chinese Gold Panda  Jewelry Main article  Jewellery Moche gold necklace depicting feline heads  Larco Museum Collection  Lima Peru Because of the softness of pure  24k  gold  it is usually alloyed with base metals for use in jewelry  altering its hardness and ductility  melting point  color and other properties  Alloys with lower caratage  typically 22k  18k  14k or 10k  contain higher percentages of copper  or other base metals or silver or palladium in the alloy  Copper is the most commonly used base metal  yielding a redder color  15  Eighteen carat gold containing 25  copper is found in antique and Russian jewelry and has a distinct  though not dominant  copper cast  creating rose gold  Fourteen carat gold copper alloy is nearly identical in color to certain bronze alloys  and both may be used to produce police and other badges  Blue gold can be made by alloying with iron and purple gold can be made by alloying with aluminium  although rarely done except in specialized jewelry  Blue gold is more brittle and therefore more difficult to work with when making jewelry  15  Fourteen and eighteen carat gold alloys with silver alone appear greenish yellow and are referred to as green gold  White gold alloys can be made with palladium or nickel  White 18 carat gold containing 17 3  nickel  5 5  zinc and 2 2  copper is silvery in appearance  Nickel is toxic  however  and its release from nickel white gold is controlled by legislation in Europe  15  Alternative white gold alloys are available based on palladium  silver and other white metals  15  but the palladium alloys are more expensive than those using nickel  High carat white gold alloys are far more resistant to corrosion than are either pure silver or sterling silver  The Japanese craft of Mokume gane exploits the color contrasts between laminated colored gold alloys to produce decorative wood grain effects  Medicine In medieval times  gold was often seen as beneficial for the health  in the belief that something so rare and beautiful could not be anything but healthy  Even some modern esotericists and forms of alternative medicine assign metallic gold a healing power  16  Some gold salts do have anti inflammatory properties and are used as pharmaceuticals in the treatment of arthritis and other similar conditions  17  Gold based injections have been explored as a means to help to reduce the pain and swelling of rheumatoid arthritis and tuberculosis  17  18  However  only salts and radioisotopes of gold are of pharmacological value  as elemental  metallic  gold is inert to all chemicals it encounters inside the body  Gold alloys are used in restorative dentistry  especially in tooth restorations  such as crowns and permanent bridges  The gold alloys  slight malleability facilitates the creation of a superior molar mating surface with other teeth and produces results that are generally more satisfactory than those produced by the creation of porcelain crowns  The use of gold crowns in more prominent teeth such as incisors is favored in some cultures and discouraged in others  Colloidal gold preparations  suspensions of gold nanoparticles  in water are intensely red colored  and can be made with tightly controlled particle sizes up to a few tens of nanometers across by reduction of gold chloride with citrate or ascorbate ions  Colloidal gold is used in research applications in medicine  biology and materials science  The technique of immunogold labeling exploits the ability of the gold particles to adsorb protein molecules onto their surfaces  Colloidal gold particles coated with specific antibodies can be used as probes for the presence and position of antigens on the surfaces of cells  19  In ultrathin sections of tissues viewed by electron microscopy  the immunogold labels appear as extremely dense round spots at the position of the antigen  20  Gold  or alloys of gold and palladium  are applied as conductive coating to biological specimens and other non conducting materials such as plastics and glass to be viewed in a scanning electron microscope  The coating  which is usually applied by sputtering with an argon plasma  has a triple role in this application  Gold s very high electrical conductivity drains electrical charge to earth  and its very high density provides stopping power for electrons in the electron beam  helping to limit the depth to which the electron beam penetrates the specimen  This improves definition of the position and topography of the specimen surface and increases the spatial resolution of the image  Gold also produces a high output of secondary electrons when irradiated by an electron beam  and these low energy electrons are the most commonly used signal source used in the scanning electron microscope  21  The isotope gold 198   half life 2 7 days  is used in some cancer treatments and for treating other diseases  22  Food and drink Gold can be used in food and has the E number 175  23  Gold leaf  flake or dust is used on and in some gourmet foods  notably sweets and drinks as decorative ingredient  24  Gold flake was used by the nobility in Medieval Europe as a decoration in food and drinks  in the form of leaf  flakes or dust  either to demonstrate the host s wealth or in the belief that something that valuable and rare must be beneficial for one s health  Danziger Goldwasser  German  Gold water of Danzig  or Goldwasser  English  Goldwater  is a traditional German herbal liqueur 25  produced in what is today Gda sk  Poland  and Schwabach  Germany  and contains flakes of gold leaf  There are also some expensive    1000  cocktails which contain flakes of gold leaf  26  However  since metallic gold is inert to all body chemistry  it has no taste  it provides no nutrition  and it leaves the body unaltered  27  Industry The 220 kg gold brick displayed in Jinguashi Gold Museum  Taiwan  Republic of China  The world s largest gold bar has a mass of 250 kg  Toi museum  Japan  A gold nugget of 5 mm in diameter  bottom  can be expanded through hammering into a gold foil of about 0 5 square meter  Toi museum  Japan  Gold solder is used for joining the components of gold jewelry by high temperature hard soldering or brazing  If the work is to be of hallmarking quality  gold solder must match the carat weight of the work  and alloy formulas are manufactured in most industry standard carat weights to color match yellow and white gold  Gold solder is usually made in at least three melting point ranges referred to as Easy  Medium and Hard  By using the hard  high melting point solder first  followed by solders with progressively lower melting points  goldsmiths can assemble complex items with several separate soldered joints  Gold can be made into thread and used in embroidery  Gold produces a deep  intense red color when used as a coloring agent in cranberry glass  In photography  gold toners are used to shift the color of silver bromide black and white prints towards brown or blue tones  or to increase their stability  Used on sepia toned prints  gold toners produce red tones  Kodak published formulas for several types of gold toners  which use gold as the chloride  28  As gold is a good reflector of electromagnetic radiation such as infrared and visible light as well as radio waves  it is used for the protective coatings on many artificial satellites  in infrared protective faceplates in thermal protection suits and astronauts  helmets and in electronic warfare planes like the EA 6B Prowler  Gold is used as the reflective layer on some high end CDs  Automobiles may use gold for heat dissipation  McLaren uses gold foil in the engine compartment of its F1 model  29  Gold can be manufactured so thin that it appears transparent  It is used in some aircraft cockpit windows for de icing or anti icing by passing electricity through it  The heat produced by the resistance of the gold is enough to deter ice from forming  30  Electronics The concentration of free electrons in gold metal is 5 90 1022 cm 3  Gold is highly conductive to electricity  and has been used for electrical wiring in some high energy applications  only silver and copper are more conductive per volume  but gold has the advantage of corrosion resistance   For example  gold electrical wires were used during some of the Manhattan Project s atomic experiments  but large high current silver wires were used in the calutron isotope separator magnets in the project  Though gold is attacked by free chlorine  its good conductivity and general resistance to oxidation and corrosion in other environments  including resistance to non chlorinated acids  has led to its widespread industrial use in the electronic era as a thin layer coating electrical connectors of all kinds  thereby ensuring good connection  For example  gold is used in the connectors of the more expensive electronics cables  such as audio  video and USB cables  The benefit of using gold over other connector metals such as tin in these applications is highly debated  Gold connectors are often criticized by audio visual experts as unnecessary for most consumers and seen as simply a marketing ploy  However  the use of gold in other applications in electronic sliding contacts in highly humid or corrosive atmospheres  and in use for contacts with a very high failure cost  certain computers  communications equipment  spacecraft  jet aircraft engines  remains very common  31  Besides sliding electrical contacts  gold is also used in electrical contacts because of its resistance to corrosion  electrical conductivity  ductility and lack of toxicity  32  Switch contacts are generally subjected to more intense corrosion stress than are sliding contacts  Fine gold wires are used to connect semiconductor devices to their packages through a process known as wire bonding  Commercial chemistry Gold is attacked by and dissolves in alkaline solutions of potassium or sodium cyanide  to form the salt gold cyanide a technique that has been used in extracting metallic gold from ores in the cyanide process  Gold cyanide is the electrolyte used in commercial electroplating of gold onto base metals and electroforming  Gold chloride  chloroauric acid  solutions are used to make colloidal gold by reduction with citrate or ascorbate ions  Gold chloride and gold oxide are used to make highly valued cranberry or red colored glass  which  like colloidal gold suspensions  contains evenly sized spherical gold nanoparticles  33  History The Turin Papyrus Map Funerary mask of Tutankhamun Jason returns with the golden fleece on an Apulian red figure calyx krater  ca  340 330 BC  Gold has been known and used by artisans since the Chalcolithic  Gold artifacts in the Balkans appear from the 4th millennium BC  such as those found in the Varna Necropolis  Bulgaria  Gold artifacts such as the golden hats and the Nebra disk appeared in Central Europe from the 2nd millennium BC Bronze Age  Egyptian hieroglyphs from as early as 2600 BC describe gold  which king Tushratta of the Mitanni claimed was  more plentiful than dirt  in Egypt  34  Egypt and especially Nubia had the resources to make them major gold producing areas for much of history  The earliest known map is known as the Turin Papyrus Map and shows the plan of a gold mine in Nubia together with indications of the local geology  The primitive working methods are described by both Strabo and Diodorus Siculus  and included fire setting  Large mines were also present across the Red Sea in what is now Saudi Arabia  The legend of the golden fleece may refer to the use of fleeces to trap gold dust from placer deposits in the ancient world  Gold is mentioned frequently in the Old Testament  starting with Genesis 2 11  at Havilah  and is included with the gifts of the magi in the first chapters of Matthew New Testament  The Book of Revelation 21 21 describes the city of New Jerusalem as having streets  made of pure gold  clear as crystal   The south east corner of the Black Sea was famed for its gold  Exploitation is said to date from the time of Midas  and this gold was important in the establishment of what is probably the world s earliest coinage in Lydia around 610 BC  35  From the 6th or 5th century BC  the Chu  state  circulated the Ying Yuan  one kind of square gold coin  In Roman metallurgy  new methods for extracting gold on a large scale were developed by introducing hydraulic mining methods  especially in Hispania from 25 BC onwards and in Dacia from 106 AD onwards  One of their largest mines was at Las Medulas in Le n  Spain   where seven long aqueducts enabled them to sluice most of a large alluvial deposit  The mines at Ro ia Montan  in Transylvania were also very large  and until very recently  still mined by opencast methods  They also exploited smaller deposits in Britain  such as placer and hard rock deposits at Dolaucothi  The various methods they used are well described by Pliny the Elder in his encyclopedia Naturalis Historia written towards the end of the first century AD  The Mali Empire in Africa was famed throughout the old world for its large amounts of gold  Mansa Musa  ruler of the empire  1312 1337  became famous throughout the old world for his great hajj to Mecca in 1324  When he passed through Cairo in July 1324  he was reportedly accompanied by a camel train that included thousands of people and nearly a hundred camels  He gave away so much gold that it depressed the price in Egypt for over a decade  36  A contemporary Arab historian remarked  Gold was at a high price in Egypt until they came in that year  The mithqal did not go below 25 dirhams and was generally above  but from that time its value fell and it cheapened in price and has remained cheap till now  The mithqal does not exceed 22 dirhams or less  This has been the state of affairs for about twelve years until this day by reason of the large amount of gold which they brought into Egypt and spent there        Chihab Al Umari 37  The European exploration of the Americas was fueled in no small part by reports of the gold ornaments displayed in great profusion by Native American peoples  especially in Central America  Peru  Ecuador and Colombia  The Aztecs regarded gold as literally the product of the gods  calling it  god excrement   teocuitlatl in Nahuatl   38  However  for the indigenous peoples of North America  gold was considered useless  and they saw much greater value in other minerals  which were directly related to their utility  such as obsidian  flint  and slate  39  Although the price of some platinum group metals can be much higher  gold has long been considered the most desirable of precious metals  and its value has been used as the standard for many currencies  known as the gold standard  in history  Gold has been used as a symbol for purity  value  royalty  and particularly roles that combine these properties  Gold as a sign of wealth and prestige was ridiculed by Thomas More in his treatise Utopia  On that imaginary island  gold is so abundant that it is used to make chains for slaves  tableware and lavatory seats  When ambassadors from other countries arrive  dressed in ostentatious gold jewels and badges  the Utopians mistake them for menial servants  paying homage instead to the most modestly dressed of their party  There is an age old tradition of biting gold to test its authenticity  Although this is certainly not a professional way of examining gold  the bite test should score the gold because gold is a soft metal  as indicated by its score on the Mohs  scale of mineral hardness  The purer the gold the easier it should be to mark it  Painted lead can cheat this test because lead is softer than gold  and may invite a small risk of lead poisoning if sufficient lead is absorbed by the biting   Gold in antiquity was relatively easy to obtain geologically  however  75  of all gold ever produced has been extracted since 1910  40  It has been estimated that all gold ever refined would form a single cube 20 m  66 ft  on a side  equivalent to 8 000 m3   40  One main goal of the alchemists was to produce gold from other substances  such as lead   presumably by the interaction with a mythical substance called the philosopher s stone  Although they never succeeded in this attempt  the alchemists promoted an interest in what can be done with substances  and this laid a foundation for today s chemistry  Their symbol for gold was the circle with a point at its center      which was also the astrological symbol and the ancient Chinese character for the Sun  For modern creation of artificial gold by neutron capture  see gold synthesis  During the 19th century  gold rushes occurred whenever large gold deposits were discovered  The first documented discovery of gold in the United States was at the Reed Gold Mine near Georgeville  North Carolina in 1803  41  The first major gold strike in the United States occurred in a small north Georgia town called Dahlonega  42  Further gold rushes occurred in California  Colorado  the Black Hills  Otago in New Zealand  Australia  Witwatersrand in South Africa  and the Klondike in Canada  Because of its historically high value  much of the gold mined throughout history is still in circulation in one form or another  Occurrence This 156 ounce  4 85 kg  nugget was found by an individual prospector in the Southern California Desert using a metal detector  Gold s atomic number of 79 makes it one of the higher atomic number elements which occur naturally  Like all elements with atomic numbers larger than iron  gold is thought to have been formed from a supernova nucleosynthesis process  Their explosions scattered metal containing dusts  including heavy elements like gold  into the region of space in which they later condensed into our solar system and the Earth  43  Because the Earth was molten when it was just formed  almost all of the gold present on Earth sank into the core  Most of the gold that is present today in the Earth s crust and mantle was delivered to Earth by asteroid impacts during the late heavy bombardment  44  On Earth  whenever elemental gold occurs  it appears most often as a metal solid solution of gold with silver  i e  a gold silver alloy  Such alloys usually have a silver content of 8 10   Electrum is elemental gold with more than 20  silver  Electrum s color runs from golden silvery to silvery  dependent upon the silver content  The more silver  the lower the specific gravity  Relative sizes of an 860 kg block of gold ore  and the 30 g of gold that can be extracted from it  Toi gold mine  Japan  Gold left behind after a pyrite cube was oxidized to hematite  Note cubic shape of cavity  Gold is found in ores made up of rock with very small or microscopic particles of gold  This gold ore is often found together with quartz or sulfide minerals such as Fool s Gold  which is a pyrite  45  These are called lode deposits  Native gold is also found in the form of free flakes  grains or larger nuggets that have been eroded from rocks and end up in alluvial deposits  called placer deposits   Such free gold is always richer at the surface of gold bearing veins owing to the oxidation of accompanying minerals followed by weathering  and washing of the dust into streams and rivers  where it collects and can be welded by water action to form nuggets  Gold sometimes occurs combined with tellurium as the minerals calaverite  krennerite  nagyagite  petzite and sylvanite  and as the rare bismuthide maldonite  Au2Bi  and antimonide aurostibite  AuSb2   Gold also occurs in rare alloys with copper  lead  and mercury  the minerals auricupride  Cu3Au   novodneprite  AuPb3  and weishanite   Au  Ag 3Hg2   Recent research suggests that microbes can sometimes play an important role in forming gold deposits  transporting and precipitating gold to form grains and nuggets that collect in alluvial deposits  46  The world s oceans contain gold  Measured concentrations of gold in the Atlantic and Northeast Pacific are 50 150 fmol L or 10 30 parts per quadrillion  about 10 30 g km3   In general  Au concentrations for Atlantic and Pacific samples are the same   50 fmol L  but less certain  Mediterranean deep waters contain higher concentrations of Au  100 150 fmol L  attributed to wind blown dust and or rivers  At 10 parts per quadrillion the Earth s oceans would hold 15 000 tons of gold  47  These figures are three orders of magnitude less than reported in the literature prior to 1988  indicating contamination problems with the earlier data  A number of people have claimed to be able to economically recover gold from sea water  but so far they have all been either mistaken or acted in an intentional deception  A so called reverend  Prescott Jernegan ran a gold from seawater swindle in the United States in the 1890s  A British fraudster ran the same scam in England in the early 1900s  48 Fritz Haber  the German inventor of the Haber process  did research on the extraction of gold from sea water in an effort to help pay Germany s reparations following World War I  49  Based on the published values of 2 to 64 ppb of gold in seawater a commercially successful extraction seemed possible  After analysis of 4 000 water samples yielding an average of 0 004 ppb it became clear that the extraction would not be possible and he stopped the project  50  No commercially viable mechanism for performing gold extraction from sea water has yet been identified  Gold synthesis is not economically viable and is unlikely to become so in the foreseeable future  Gallery of specimens of crystalline native gold Native gold nuggets  Rope gold  from Lena River  Sakha Republic  Russia

Australia Pure gold precipitate produced by the aqua regia refining process Gold extraction is most economical in large  easily mined deposits  Ore grades as little as 0 5 mg kg  0 5 parts per million  ppm  can be economical  Typical ore grades in open pit mines are 1 5 mg kg  1 5 ppm   ore grades in underground or hard rock mines are usually at least 3 mg kg  3 ppm   Because ore grades of 30 mg kg  30 ppm  are usually needed before gold is visible to the naked eye  in most gold mines the gold is invisible  Since the 1880s  South Africa has been the source for a large proportion of the world s gold supply  with about 50  of all gold ever produced having come from South Africa  Production in 1970 accounted for 79  of the world supply  producing about 1 480 tonnes  2008 production was 2 260 tonnes  In 2007 China  with 276 tonnes  overtook South Africa as the world s largest gold producer  the first time since 1905 that South Africa has not been the largest  51  The city of Johannesburg located in South Africa was founded as a result of the Witwatersrand Gold Rush which resulted in the discovery of some of the largest gold deposits the world has ever seen  Gold fields located within the basin in the Free State and Gauteng provinces are extensive in strike and dip requiring some of the world s deepest mines  with the Savuka and TauTona mines being currently the world s deepest gold mine at 3 777 m  The Second Boer War of 1899 1901 between the British Empire and the Afrikaner Boers was at least partly over the rights of miners and possession of the gold wealth in South Africa  Other major producers are the United States  Australia  Russia and Peru  Mines in South Dakota and Nevada supply two thirds of gold used in the United States  In South America  the controversial project Pascua Lama aims at exploitation of rich fields in the high mountains of Atacama Desert  at the border between Chile and Argentina  Today about one quarter of the world gold output is estimated to originate from artisanal or small scale mining  52  After initial production  gold is often subsequently refined industrially by the Wohlwill process which is based on electrolysis or by the Miller process  that is chlorination in the melt  The Wohlwill process results in higher purity  but is more complex and is only applied in small scale installations  53  54  Other methods of assaying and purifying smaller amounts of gold include parting and inquartation as well as cupellation  or refining methods based on the dissolution of gold in aqua regia  55  At the end of 2009  it was estimated that all the gold ever mined totaled 165 000 tonnes  2  This can be represented by a cube with an edge length of about 20 28 meters  At  1 600 per ounce  165 000 tons of gold would have a value of  8 8 trillion  The average gold mining and extraction costs were about US 317 oz in 2007  but these can vary widely depending on mining type and ore quality  global mine production amounted to 2 471 1 tonnes  56  Most of the gold used in manufactured goods  jewelry  and works of art is eventually recovered and recycled  Some gold used in spacecraft and electronic equipment cannot be profitably recovered  but it is generally used in these applications in the form of extremely thin layers or extremely fine wires so that the total quantity used  and lost  is small compared to the total amount of gold produced and stockpiled  Thus there is little true consumption of new gold in the economic sense  the stock of gold remains essentially constant  at least in the modern world  while ownership shifts from one party to another  57  One estimate is that 85  of all the gold ever mined is still available in the world s easily recoverable stocks  with 15  having been lost  or used in non recyclable industrial uses  58  Consumption The consumption of gold produced in the world is about 50  in jewelry  40  in investments  and 10  in industry  India is the world s largest single consumer of gold  as Indians buy about 25  of the world s gold  59  purchasing approximately 800 tonnes of gold every year  mostly for jewelry  India is also the largest importer of gold  in 2008  India imported around 400 tonnes of gold  60  Indian households hold 18 000 tonnes of gold which represents 11 per cent of the global stock and worth more than  950 billion  61  Gold

Gold  III  chloride solution in water Although gold is a noble metal  it forms many and diverse compounds  The oxidation state of gold in its compounds ranges from  1 to  5  but Au I  and Au III  dominate its chemistry  Au I   referred to as the aurous ion  is the most common oxidation state with soft ligands such as thioethers  thiolates  and tertiary phosphines  Au I  compounds are typically linear  A good example is Au CN 2   which is the soluble form of gold encountered in mining  Curiously  aurous complexes of water are rare  The binary gold halides  such as AuCl  form zigzag polymeric chains  again featuring linear coordination at Au  Most drugs based on gold are Au I  derivatives  63  Au III   auric  is a common oxidation state  and is illustrated by gold III  chloride  Au2Cl6  The gold atom centers in Au III  complexes  like other d8 compounds  are typically square planar  with chemical bonds that have both covalent and ionic character  Aqua regia  a 1 3 mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid  dissolves gold  Nitric acid oxidizes the metal to  3 ions  but only in minute amounts  typically undetectable in the pure acid because of the chemical equilibrium of the reaction  However  the ions are removed from the equilibrium by hydrochloric acid  forming AuCl4  ions  or chloroauric acid  thereby enabling further oxidation  Some free halogens react with gold  64  Gold also reacts in alkaline solutions of potassium cyanide  With mercury  it forms an amalgam  Less common oxidation states Less common oxidation states of gold include  1   2  and  5  The  1 oxidation state occurs in compounds containing the Au anion  called aurides  Caesium auride  CsAu   for example  crystallizes in the caesium chloride motif  65  Other aurides include those of Rb   K   and tetramethylammonium  CH3 4N   66  Gold has the highest Pauling electronegativity of any metal  with a value of 2 54  making the auride anion relatively stable  Gold II  compounds are usually diamagnetic with Au Au bonds such as  Au CH2 2P C6H5 2 2Cl2  The evaporation of a solution of Au OH 3 in concentrated H2SO4 produces red crystals of gold II  sulfate  Au2 SO4 2  Originally thought to be a mixed valence compound  it has been shown to contain Au4  2 cations  67  68  A noteworthy  legitimate gold II  complex is the tetraxenonogold II  cation  which contains xenon as a ligand  found in  AuXe4  Sb2F11 2  69  Gold pentafluoride  along with its derivative anion  AuF  6  and its difluorine complex  gold heptafluoride  is the sole example of gold V   the highest verified oxidation state  70  Some gold compounds exhibit aurophilic bonding  which describes the tendency of gold ions to interact at distances that are too long to be a conventional Au Au bond but shorter than van der Waals bonding  The interaction is estimated to be comparable in strength to that of a hydrogen bond  Mixed valence compounds Well defined cluster compounds are numerous  66  In such cases  gold has a fractional oxidation state  A representative example is the octahedral species  Au P C6H5 3  62   Gold chalcogenides  such as gold sulfide  feature equal amounts of Au I  and Au III   Toxicity Pure metallic  elemental  gold is non toxic and non irritating when ingested 71  and is sometimes used as a food decoration in the form of gold leaf  Metallic gold is also a component of the alcoholic drinks Goldschl ger  Gold Strike  and Goldwasser  Metallic gold is approved as a food additive in the EU  E175 in the Codex Alimentarius   Although gold ion is toxic  the acceptance of metallic gold as a food additive is due to its relative chemical inertness  and resistance to being corroded or transformed into soluble salts  gold compounds  by any known chemical process which would be encountered in the human body  Soluble compounds  gold salts  such as gold chloride are toxic to the liver and kidneys  Common cyanide salts of gold such as potassium gold cyanide  used in gold electroplating  are toxic by virtue of both their cyanide and gold content  There are rare cases of lethal gold poisoning from potassium gold cyanide  72  73  Gold toxicity can be ameliorated with chelation therapy with an agent such as Dimercaprol  Gold metal was voted Allergen of the Year in 2001 by the American Contact Dermatitis Society  Gold contact allergies affect mostly women  74  Despite this  gold is a relatively non potent contact allergen  in comparison with metals like nickel  75  Price Gold price history in 1960 2011 Like other precious metals  gold is measured by troy weight and by grams  When it is alloyed with other metals the term carat or karat is used to indicate the purity of gold present  with 24 carats being pure gold and lower ratings proportionally less  The purity of a gold bar or coin can also be expressed as a decimal figure ranging from 0 to 1  known as the millesimal fineness  such as 0 995 being very pure  The price of gold is determined through trading in the gold and derivatives markets  but a procedure known as the Gold Fixing in London  originating in September 1919  provides a daily benchmark price to the industry  The afternoon fixing was introduced in 1968 to provide a price when US markets are open  Historically gold coinage was widely used as currency  when paper money was introduced  it typically was a receipt redeemable for gold coin or bullion  In a monetary system known as the gold standard  a certain weight of gold was given the name of a unit of currency  For a long period  the United States government set the value of the US dollar so that one troy ounce was equal to  20 67   664 56 kg   but in 1934 the dollar was devalued to  35 00 per troy ounce   1125 27 kg   By 1961  it was becoming hard to maintain this price  and a pool of US and European banks agreed to manipulate the market to prevent further currency devaluation against increased gold demand  A Swiss cast 1 kg gold bar  On March 17  1968  economic circumstances caused the collapse of the gold pool  and a two tiered pricing scheme was established whereby gold was still used to settle international accounts at the old  35 00 per troy ounce   1 13 g  but the price of gold on the private market was allowed to fluctuate  this two tiered pricing system was abandoned in 1975 when the price of gold was left to find its free market level  Central banks still hold historical gold reserves as a store of value although the level has generally been declining  The largest gold depository in the world is that of the U S  Federal Reserve Bank in New York  which holds about 3  76  of the gold ever mined  as does the similarly laden U S  Bullion Depository at Fort Knox  In 2005 the World Gold Council estimated total global gold supply to be 3 859 tonnes and demand to be 3 754 tonnes  giving a surplus of 105 tonnes  77  Since 1968 the price of gold has ranged widely  from a high of  850 oz   27 300 kg  on January 21  1980  to a low of  252 90 oz   8 131 kg  on June 21  1999  London Gold Fixing   78  The period from 1999 to 2001 marked the  Brown Bottom  after a 20 year bear market  79  Prices increased rapidly from 1991  but the 1980 high was not exceeded until January 3  2008 when a new maximum of  865 35 per troy ounce was set  80  Another record price was set on March 17  2008 at  1023 50 oz   32 900 kg   80  In late 2009  gold markets experienced renewed momentum upwards due to increased demand and a weakening US dollar  On December 2  2009  Gold passed the important barrier of US 1200 per ounce to close at  1215  81  Gold further rallied hitting new highs in May 2010 after the European Union debt crisis prompted further purchase of gold as a safe asset  82  83  On March 1  2011  gold hit a new all time high of  1432 57  based on investor concerns regarding ongoing unrest in North Africa as well as in the Middle East  84  Since April 2001 the gold price has more than quintupled in value against the US dollar  hitting a new all time high of  1 913 50 on August 23  2011  85  prompting speculation that this long secular bear market has ended and a bull market has returned  86  Symbolism Gold bars at the Emperor Casino in Macau Gold has been highly valued in many societies throughout the ages  In keeping with this it has often had a strongly positive symbolic meaning closely connected to the values held in the highest esteem in the society in question  Gold may symbolize power  strength  wealth  warmth  happiness  love  hope  optimism  intelligence  justice  balance  perfection  summer  harvest and the sun  Great human achievements are frequently rewarded with gold  in the form of gold medals  golden trophies and other decorations  Winners of athletic events and other graded competitions are usually awarded a gold medal  e g   the Olympic Games   Many awards such as the Nobel Prize are made from gold as well  Other award statues and prizes are depicted in gold or are gold plated  such as the Academy Awards  the Golden Globe Awards  the Emmy Awards  the Palme d Or  and the British Academy Film Awards   Aristotle in his ethics used gold symbolism when referring to what is now commonly known as the golden mean  Similarly  gold is associated with perfect or divine principles  such as in the case of the golden ratio and the golden rule  Gold is further associated with the wisdom of aging and fruition  The fiftieth wedding anniversary is golden  Our precious latter years are sometimes considered  golden years   The height of a civilization is referred to as a  golden age   In Christianity gold has sometimes been associated with the extremities of utmost evil and the greatest sanctity  In the Book of Exodus  the Golden Calf is a symbol of idolatry  In the Book of Genesis  Abraham was said to be rich in gold and silver  and Moses was instructed to cover the Mercy Seat of the Ark of the Covenant with pure gold  In Christian art the halos of Christ  Mary and the Christian saints are golden  Medieval kings were inaugurated under the signs of sacred oil and a golden crown  the latter symbolizing the eternal shining light of heaven and thus a Christian king s divinely inspired authority  Wedding rings have long been made of gold  It is long lasting and unaffected by the passage of time and may aid in the ring symbolism of eternal vows before God and or the sun and moon and the perfection the marriage signifies  In Orthodox Christianity  the wedded couple is adorned with a golden crown during the ceremony  an amalgamation of symbolic rites  In popular culture gold holds many connotations but is most generally connected to terms such as good or great  such as in the phrases   has a heart of gold    that s golden     golden moment    then you re golden   and  golden boy   Gold also still holds its place as a symbol of wealth and through that  in many societies  success  State emblem In 1965  the California Legislature designated gold  the State Mineral and mineralogical emblem   87  In 1968  the Alaska Legislature named gold  the official state mineral   88  See also Bulk leach extractable gold Commodity fetishism  Marxist economic theory  Digital
