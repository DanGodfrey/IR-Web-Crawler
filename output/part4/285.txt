threatening the safety of the world  1  Cast Robert Downey  Jr  as Tony Stark   Iron Man  A self described genius  billionaire  playboy and philanthropist with a mechanical suit of armor of his own invention  Downey was cast as part of his four picture deal with Marvel Studios  which includes Iron Man 2 and The Avengers  4  Downey stated that he initially pushed Whedon to make Stark the lead revealing   Well  I said   I need to be in the opening sequence  I don t know what you re thinking  but Tony needs to drive this thing   He was like   Okay  let s try that   We tried it and it didn t work  because this is a different sort of thing  the story and the idea and the theme is the theme  and everybody is just an arm of the octopus   5  About the character s evolution from previous films  Downey commented   In Iron Man  which was an origin story  he was his own epiphany and redemption of sorts  Iron Man 2 is all about not being an island  dealing with legacy issues and making space for others    In The Avengers  he s throwing it down with the others   6  Chris Evans as Steve Rogers   Captain America  A World War II veteran who was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum  Evans was cast as part of a deal to star in three Marvel films  in addition to The Avengers  7  Evans stated that Steve Rogers is much darker in The Avengers  explaining   It s just about him trying to come to terms with the modern world  You ve got to imagine  it s enough of a shock to accept the fact that you re in a completely different time  but everybody you know is dead  Everybody you cared about    He was a soldier  obviously  everybody he went to battle with  all of his brothers in arms  they re all dead  He s just lonely  I think in the beginning it s a fish out of water scene  and it s tough  It s a tough pill for him to swallow  Then comes trying to find a balance with the modern world   5  Regarding the dynamic between Captain America and Tony Stark  Evans remarked   I think there s certainly a dichotomy this kind of friction between myself and Tony Stark  they re polar opposites  One guy is flash and spotlight and smooth  and the other guy is selfless and in the shadows and kind of quiet and they have to get along  They explore that  and it s pretty fun   8  Mark Ruffalo as Dr  Bruce Banner   Hulk  A genius scientist who  because of exposure to gamma radiation  transforms into a monster when enraged or excited  Ruffalo was cast after negotiations between Marvel and Edward Norton broke down  9  About replacing Edward Norton  Ruffalo said   I m a friend of Ed s  and yeah  that wasn t a great way for all that to go down  But the way I see it is that Ed has bequeathed this part to me  I look at it as my generation s Hamlet   About the character he stated   He s a guy struggling with two sides of himself the dark and the light and everything he does in his life is filtered through issues of control  I grew up on the Bill Bixby TV series  which I thought was a really nuanced and real human way to look at the Hulk  I like that the part has those qualities   10  Regarding the Hulk s place on the team Ruffalo said   He s like the teammate none of them are sure they want on their team  He s a loose cannon  It s like   Just throw a grenade in the middle of the group and let s hope it turns out well   11  Ruffalo also told New York magazine that unlike previous incarnations  he will actually play the Hulk   I m really excited  No one s ever played the Hulk exactly  they ve always done CGI  They re going to do the Avatar stop action  stop motion capture  So I ll actually play the Hulk  That ll be fun   12  About his preparation for the role Ruffalo joked   I ve lost 15 pounds and I ve put another five on of just strapping  pure USDA beef    They want me mean and lean  but they don t want me big and buff   13  Lou Ferrigno will voice the Hulk  14  15  Cast of The Avengers at the 2010 San Diego Comic Con International  with Joss Whedon and Kevin Feige  Chris Hemsworth as Thor  The god of thunder based on the Norse deity of the same name  Hemsworth was cast as part of a multiple movie deal  16  He had previously worked with Joss Whedon on The Cabin in the Woods  17  Hemsworth stated that he was able to maintain the strength he built up for Thor by increasing his food intake  consisting of a number of chicken breasts  fish  steak and eggs a day  When asked exactly how much  Hemsworth joked   My body weight in protein pretty much   18  About Thor s motivations Hemsworth remarked   I think  Thor s  motivation is much more of a personal one  in the sense that it s his brother that is stirring things up  Whereas everyone else  it s some bad guy who they ve gotta take down  It s a different approach for me  or for Thor  He s constantly having to battle the greater good and what he should do vs  it s his little brother there    I ve been frustrated with my brothers at times  or family  but I m the only one who is allowed to be angry at them  There s a bit of that   5  Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff   Black Widow  A highly trained spy working for the international peacekeeping organization  S H I E L D  19  About the character and her relationship with Hawkeye  Johansson commented   Our characters have a long history  they ve fought together for a long time in a lot of battles in many different countries  We re the two members of this avenging group who are skilled warriors   we have no superpowers  Black Widow is definitely one of the team though  She s not in the cast simply to be a romantic foil or eye candy  She s there to fight  so I never felt like I was the only girl  We all have our various skills and it feels equal   6  Regarding her training Johansson stated   Even though Iron Man 2 was  one for them   I d never done anything like that before  I d never been physically driven in something  or a part of something so big  For The Avengers  I ve spent so many months training with our stunt team  and fighting all the other actors  it s crazy  I do nothing but fight all the time   20  Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton   Hawkeye  A S H I E L D  agent and master archer known in the comics as the  World s Greatest Marksman   21  Renner said it was a very physical role and that he trained physically and practiced archery as much as possible in preparation  22  About the role  Renner remarked   When I saw Iron Man  I thought that was a really kick ass approach to superheroes  Then they told me about this Hawkeye character  and I liked how he wasn t really a superhero  he s just a guy with a high skill set  I could connect to that  6  Regarding Hawkeye s sniper mentality  Renner stated   It s a lonely game  He s an outcast  His only connection is to Scarlett s character  Natasha  It s like a left hand right hand thing  They coexist  and you need them both  especially when it comes to a physical mission   6  Renner said Hawkeye is not insecure about his humanity explaining   Quite the opposite  he s the only one who can really take down The Hulk with his  tranquilizer tipped  arrows  He knows his limitations  But when it comes down to it  there has to be a sense of confidence in any superhero   5  Tom Hiddleston as Loki  Thor s adoptive brother and nemesis based on the deity of the same name  16  In regard to his character s evolution from the film Thor  Hiddleston stated   I think the Loki we see in The Avengers is further advanced  You have to ask yourself the question  how pleasant an experience is it disappearing into a wormhole that has been created by some kind of super nuclear explosion of his own making  So I think by the time Loki shows up in The Avengers he s seen a few things   23  About Loki s motivations  Hiddleston remarked   At the beginning of The Avengers  he comes to Earth to subjugate it and his idea is to rule the human race as their king  And like all the delusional autocrats of human history  he thinks this is a great idea because if everyone is busy worshipping him  there will be no wars so he will create some kind of world peace by ruling them as a tyrant  But he is also kind of deluded in the fact that he thinks unlimited power will give him self respect so I haven t let go of the fact that he is still motivated by this terrible jealousy and kind of spiritual desolation   24  Samuel L  Jackson as Nick Fury  The director of S H I E L D   who was revealed in previous films to be coordinating the  Avenger Initiative   Jackson was brought to the project with a deal containing an option to play the character in up to nine Marvel films  25  Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill  A S H I E L D  agent who works closely with Jackson s Nick Fury  26  Smulders  whom Joss Whedon once considered for his unproduced live action Wonder Woman film  was selected from a short list of potential actresses including Morena Baccarin  Smulders  deal would integrate her into nine films  27  28  Regarding her preparation  Smulders stated   I hired this amazing black ops trainer to teach me how to hold a gun  take me to a shooting range  how to hit  how to hold myself  how to walk and basically how to look  I don t do a ton of fighting in the movie  which is why I wasn t offered a trainer  but I wanted to look like I had the ability to  And I really just got down and dirty with the character  but then I finally went on set  when you re about to roll  all the  blubbity blue  you ve been working on kind of messes with you  And you become a little bit detached    sic  29  On relating to the character  Smulders commented   I can relate to her being a mom and being a business woman and trying to work full time and raising a family and having a career  We re asked to do a lot of things these days  I feel she is just all about her job and keeping things going   30  Clark Gregg  Stellan Skarsg rd and Gwyneth Paltrow reprise their roles from previous films as Phil Coulson  Erik Selvig and Pepper Potts respectively  31  32  33 Paul Bettany returns to voice JARVIS  34  Avengers co creator Stan Lee will have a cameo appearance  35  Production Development  It goes back to the very first incarnation of The Avengers  it goes to The Ultimates  it goes to everything about it  It makes no sense  it s ridiculous  There s a thunder god  there s a green  id  giant rage monster  there s Captain America from the 40s  there s Tony Stark who definitely doesn t get along with anybody  Ultimately these people don t belong together and the whole movie is about finding yourself from community  And finding that you not only belong together but you need each other  very much  Obviously this will be expressed through punching but it will be the heart of the film   Joss Whedon  director of The Avengers  about the film  36  Marvel Studios chair CEO Avi Arad first announced plans to develop an Avengers film in April 2005 after Marvel Enterprises declared independence by pacting with Merrill Lynch to produce a slate of films that would be distributed by Paramount Pictures  37  In September 2006 Marvel confirmed their crossover plans in a brief presentation to Wall

an Avengers movie  38  Marvel Studios announced in July 2007 that screen writer Zak Penn  who wrote The Incredible Hulk  had been hired to write the film and will be titled  The Avengers  39  Penn confirmed his involvement but said he did not believe work would begin soon  40  In January 2008  Marvel struck a deal with the striking Writers Guild of America so that the company could go back to

also tied her to The Avengers  19  The following day Marvel announced that the release date for The Avengers had been pushed back to May 4  2012  almost a full year later  46  In June  Marvel s president of production Kevin Feige confirmed that Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston would reprise their roles as Thor and Loki  respectively  in The Avengers  16  In July screenwriter Zak Penn talked about the crossover process  stating   My job is to kind of shuttle between the different movies and make sure that finally we re mimicking that comic book structure where all of these movies are connected    There s just a board that tracks  Here s where everything that happens in this movie overlaps with that movie     I m pushing them to do as many animatics as possible to animate the movie  to draw boards so that we re all working off the same visual ideas  But the exigencies of production take first priority   47  The following month  Marvel Studios chief Kevin Fiege stated he would introduce more characters into The Avengers and that the Hulk would factor in the film  48  In September  Edward Norton stated that he was open to returning as The Hulk for The Avengers  49  The next month  executive producer Jon Favreau stated that he would not direct the film but will     definitely have input and a say   Favreau also expressed concerns stating   It s going to be hard  because I was so involved in creating the world of Iron Man and Iron Man is very much a tech based hero  and then with  Avengers  you re going to be introducing some supernatural aspects because of Thor       Mixing  the two of those works very well in the comic books  but it s going to take a lot of thoughtfulness to make that all work and not blow the reality that we ve created   50  In January 2010  Kevin Feige was asked if it will be difficult to meld the fantasy of Thor with the high tech science fiction in Iron Man and The Avengers   No   he said   because we re doing the Jack Kirby Stan Lee Walt Simonson J  Michael Straczynski Thor  We re not doing the blow the dust off of the old Norse book in your library Thor  And in the Thor of the Marvel Universe  there s a race called the Asgardians  And we re linked through this Tree of Life that we re unaware of  It s real science  but we don t know about it yet  The  Thor  movie is about teaching people that   51  In

Arad confirmed Joss Whedon s involvement  54  Arad praised the decision by stating   My personal opinion is that Joss will do a fantastic job  He loves these characters and is a fantastic writer    It s part of his life so you know he is going to protect it    I expect someone like him is going to make the script even better   55  In June 2010  it was reported that Jeremy Renner was in final negotiations to play Hawkeye in the film  21  The following month  Marvel Comics said it declined to have Edward Norton reprise his role as Bruce Banner  56  The next day Kevin Feige  the president of Marvel Studios  confirmed the report stating   We have made the decision to not bring Ed Norton back to portray the title role of Bruce Banner in The Avengers  Our decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors  but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members  The Avengers demands players who thrive working as part of an ensemble  as evidenced by Robert  Chris H  Chris E  Samuel  Scarlett  and all of our talented casts  We are looking to announce a name actor who fulfills these requirements  and is passionate about the iconic role in the coming weeks   57  In response Norton s agent Brian Swardstrom called Feige s statement  purposefully misleading  and an  inappropriate attempt to paint our client in a negative light   58  Joss Whedon announced at the 2010 San Diego Comic Con International that he is directing The Avengers  Whedon mentioned that he was a fan of the early Avengers comics while growing up  59  He also said he is still writing an outline for the film and that what drew him to the movie is that he loves how  these people shouldn t be in the same room let alone on the same team and that is the definition of family   60  Whedon also confirmed that Jeremy Renner would play Hawkeye  61  It was reported during the convention that Mark Ruffalo would replace Edward

Concept illustrator and designer of Iron Man s Mark VII armor  Phil Saunders stated that  Joss Whedon was looking for something that had the  cool  factor of the suitcase suit  from Iron Man 2   while still being a fully armored  heavy duty suit that could take on an army in the final battle   To that end  Saunders borrowed ideas that had been proposed in Iron Man 2 as well as some ideas that had been abandoned in Iron Man and merged them together in a modular suit that has big ammo packets on the arms and a backpack  72  The Science  amp  Entertainment Exchange also provided science consultation for the film  73  Filming Part of The Avengers film set on East 9th Street in Cleveland  Ohio  Part of The Avengers film set on Park Avenue in New York City  Principal photography began

Columbus  Ohio based 391st Military Police Battalion provided background action during the battle scenes in Cleveland  Staff Sgt  Michael T  Landis stated the use of real soldiers made the scenes more realistic and helped portray the Army in a more positive light  explaining that   It s easy for us to make on the spot corrections to tactics and uniforms  the director actually took our recommendation on one scene and let us all engage the enemy as opposed to only the gunners in the trucks engaging   78  Filming also took place in the large vacuum chamber at the NASA Plum Brook Station near Sandusky  Ohio  79  The station s Space Power Facility was used to portray a S H I E L D  research facility  80  A series of explosions were filmed at the Chevrolet powertrain plant in

fan of extreme long lens  talky movies   I like to see the space I m in and relate to it  so 3D kinda fits my aesthetic anyway  And the technology has advanced so far in the past couple years   Whedon also admitted that  there definitely are movies that shouldn t be in 3D  but  The Avengers isn t obnoxiously 3D  There s no   Oh look  we re going to spend 20 minutes going through this tunnel because it s in 3D   And no one is pointing at the screen the entire time  But it s an action movie  Things tend to hurtle toward the screen anyway   88  In January 2012  it was reported that The Avengers

that Alan Silvestri  who scored Captain America  The First Avenger  would write and compose the score for The Avengers  Silvestri stated   This is actually a very unique experience  for me   I ve worked on films where there have been a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film  but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world and it s a very different situation  It s very challenging to look for a way to give everyone the weight and consideration they need  but at the same time the film is really about the coming together of these characters  which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together   96  Marketing Chris Evans  Tom Hiddleston  Cobie Smulders and Clark Gregg promoting The Avengers at the 2011 New York Comic Con  The film was promoted at the 2010 San Diego Comic Con International  during which a teaser trailer narrated by Samuel L  Jackson was shown followed by an introduction of the cast  31  In June 2011  Marvel Studios announced that it would not hold a panel at the 2011 San Diego Comic Con International after studios executives decided it was not prepared to compete with its own past and fan expectations with filming still in production  97  In July 2011  a teaser trailer that was meant to be the post credits scene of Captain America  The First Avenger was briefly leaked online  Entertainment Weekly speculated it came from a preview screening and described the footage as  shaky  fuzzy  flickering and obviously filmed on a cell phone   98  In August 2011  Walt Disney Studios  Pixar Animation Studios and Marvel Studios presented a look at Walt Disney Studios  upcoming film slate  which included Marvel s The Avengers  at the D23 Expo in Anaheim  California  The presentation featured footage from the film and appearances by the cast members  99  Also in August  Disney dismissed Marvel s executive vice president of worldwide marketing  vice president of worldwide marketing and manager of worldwide marketing to bring their functions in house  100  In September 2011  Paul Gitter  president of consumer products for Marvel Entertainment commented that the build up to The Avengers has helped strengthen retail partnerships   Retailers have been less tolerant with IP films  so we decided that if we started on this coordinated strategy several years ago  retailers would give us shelf space throughout the years and we would have a more sustainable position in the marketplace   101  In October 2011  Marvel Studios held a presentation at the New York Comic Con that featured new footage and a panel discussion including producer Kevin Feige and several cast members  102  The first full length trailer was also released in October  Comic Book Resources said   The two minute teaser handily establishes the movie s premise  and is  heavy on the assembling  but fans are also treated to plenty of action  as well glimpses  sic  of Iron Man s new armor and  best of all  the new take on the Incredible Hulk  Naturally  Robert Downey Jr  s Tony Stark gets the best lines   103  However  The Hollywood Reporter called it  Awesome  Or it would be if we hadn t seen all of this before and expected every single thing that we saw in the trailer   104  The trailer which debuted exclusively on iTunes Movie Trailers  was downloaded over 10 million times in its first 24 hours  breaking the website s record for the most viewed trailer  105  However  this record was later surpassed by the trailer for The Dark Knight Rises which was downloaded more than 12 5 million times in its first 24 hours  106  In December 2011  Marvel announced that a four issue comic book prelude to the film  written by Christopher Yost and Eric Pearson with art by Luke Ross and Daniel HDR  will be released in

Clark Gregg and a 10 second tease of the 30 second Super Bowl advert that aired during Super Bowl XLVI in February  108  According to the Los Angeles Times  Disney paid an estimated  4 million for the 30 second spot  109  In February 2012  Marvel announced the release of a second limited series comic book tie in entitled  Black Widow Strikes  written by Fred Van Lente  who wrote  Captain America  First Vengeance   which served as a prequel to Captain America  The First Avenger  The story is set between Iron Man 2 and The Avengers and follows Black Widow as she runs down some loose ends from Iron Man 2  namely some bootleg Stark technology that Justin Hammer made  110  A second full length trailer was also released on iTunes in February  reaching a record 13 7 milllion downloads in 24 hours  besting the previous record set by The Dark Knight Rises  111  Promotional partners In September 2011  set photos of Tony Stark  Robert Downey Jr   driving a new model Acura were published online  An Acura spokesperson later released a statement confirming the company s involvement with the film   As you may know  Acura has been in the Marvel Comics Universe films as the official car of their fictional law enforcement agency called S H I E L D  That relationship continues for The Avengers  The open top sports car that was photographed yesterday is a one off  fictional car that was made just for the movie and will not be produced  That said  as you may also know  our CEO has said publicly that we are studying the development of a new sportscar  but we can t say any more about it at this time   112  In December 2011  Acura announced that a new NSX styled along the lines of the concept built for The Avengers will be unveiled at the 2012 North American International Auto Show  113  In February 2012  it was announced that Marvel has partnered with JADS  a fragrance company  to promote The Avengers with uniquely character based fragrances  The announcement was timed to be noted just ahead of the Toy Industry Association s annual February exhibition  where representatives held a sampling booth of the products  114  Other promotional partners include Dr Pepper  Harley Davidson and The Hershey Company  115  116  117  Video game A video game based on the film was planned for concurrent release  The game was to be a first person shooter brawler for the Xbox 360  PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows and published by THQ  with THQ Studio Australia developing of the console versions and Blue Tongue Entertainment the PC version  After THQ closed both studios  the game was cancelled  118 Intellectual property rights for an Avengers video game reverted to Marvel  which said it was exploring potential publishing and licensing opportunities  119  Release In February 2012  Disney said the film would be titled Avengers Assemble in the United Kingdom  to avoid confusion with the British TV series of the same name  as well as its 1998 film adaptation  120  121  The world premiere for The Avengers is scheduled to be held on Wednesday  April 11  2012 at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood  California  122  Sequel In October 2011  producer Kevin Feige hinted at a sequel to The Avengers during the New York Comic Con stating   Iron Man 3 will be the first of what we sort of refer to as phase two of this saga that will culminate  God willing  in Avengers 2   123  In March 2012  Joss Whedon stated that he would want a sequel to be     smaller  More personal  More painful  By being the next thing that should happen to these characters  and not just a rehash of what seemed to work the first time  By having a theme that is completely fresh and organic to itself   124  Notes  1 As part of the negotiation deal of transferring the distribution
