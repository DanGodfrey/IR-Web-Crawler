Category  Race v t e The term black people is used in some socially based systems of racial classification for humans of a dark skinned phenotype  relative to other racial groups represented in a particular social context  Different societies apply different criteria regarding who is classified as  black   and often social variables such as class and socio economic status also play a role  so that relatively dark skinned people can be classified as white if they fulfill other social criteria of  whiteness  and relatively light skinned people can be classified as black if they fulfill the social criteria for  blackness  in a particular setting  1  As a biological phenotype being  black  is often associated with the very dark skin colors of some people who are classified as  black   But  particularly in the United States  the racial or ethnic classification also refers to people with all possible kinds of skin pigmentation from the darkest through to the very lightest skin colors  including albinos  if they are believed by others to have African ancestry  or to exhibit cultural traits associated with being  African American   As a result  in the United States the term  black people  is not an indicator of skin color but of socially based racial classification  2  Some definitions of the term include only people of relatively recent Sub Saharan African descent  see African diaspora   Among the members of this group  dark skin is most often accompanied by the expression of natural afro hair texture  Other definitions of the term  black people  extend to other populations characterized by dark skin  sometimes including people indigenous to Oceania  3  4  Contents 1 Physiological traits 1 1 Dark skin 1 2 Hair 1 3 Sub Saharan Africa 2 Cultural ideas of a black race 2 1

Eastern Europe 3 See also 4 Footnotes Physiological traits Dark skin Further information  Human skin color Map of indigenous skin color distribution in the world based on Von Luschan s chromatic scale  The evolution of dark skin is linked intrinsically to the loss of body hair in humans  By 1 2 million years ago  all people having descendants today had the same receptor protein of today s Africans  their skin was dark  and the intense sun lowered the chance of survival of those with lighter skin that resulted from mutational variation in the receptor protein  5  This is significantly earlier than the speciation of Homo sapiens from Homo erectus some 250 000 years ago  Skin cancer as a result of ultraviolet light radiation causing mutations in the skin is less common among people with dark skin than it is among those with light skin  6  7  Dark skin prevents an essential B vitamin  folate  from being destroyed  In the absence of modern medicine and diet  a person with dark skin in the tropics would live longer  be healthier and more likely to reproduce than a person with light skin  As evidence of this expectation of adverse effects of light skin in the tropics  White South Africans  8  and white Australians have some of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world  9  Conversely  as dark skin prevents sunlight from penetrating the skin  it hinders the production of vitamin D3  When humans migrated to less sun intensive regions in the north  low vitamin D3 levels became a problem  and humans with lighter skin were more successful in reproducing  White people of Europe  who have low levels of melanin  naturally have an almost colorless skin pigmentation  especially when untanned  This low level of pigmentation allows the blood vessels to become visible  which gives the characteristic pale pink color of white people  The loss of melanin in white people is thought to have been caused by a mutation in one letter out of 3 1 billion letters of DNA  10  The genetic mutations leading to light skin  though different among East Asians and Europeans  11  suggest the two groups experienced a similar selective pressure due to settlement in northern latitudes  12  Black skin pigmentation has been linked to a number of other properties  including tactile characteristics  and slower and less pronounced development of wrinkles  13  Hair Main article  Afro textured hair The texture of hair in people of Sub Saharan African ancestry is noticeably different from that of European and Asian populations  Herodotus described the peoples of Libya  the  western Ethiopians   as woolly haired  Such  afro hair  texture is denser than its straight counterparts  Due to this  it is often referred to as  coily    thick    nappy    bushy   or  woolly   For several reasons  possibly including its relatively flat cross section  among other factors 14    this hair type conveys a dry or matte appearance  15  16  It is coarse  15  and its unique shape renders it prone to breakage when combed or brushed  16  The specific characteristics of the natural afro hair form are unique among all mammals  clarification needed  dubious   discuss  17  The texture likely predates the evolution of dark skin  It evolved when  as pre human australopithecines lost most of their fur to enable perspiration  the need to protect the newly exposed pale skin underneath this body hair was crucial  see 18  in light of Rogers and others   2004 and Harding and others   2000   The trait ceased to be essential to survival at the equator upon the evolution of hairless dark skin  Yet it has continued to be expressed vestigially among most Melanesians  Andaman Islanders  and sub Saharan Africans  Sub Saharan Africa Further information  Demographics of Africa A black woman and her albino son from Tanzania Sub Saharan Africa is a common  if imprecise term that encompasses African countries located south of the Sahara Desert  It is commonly used to differentiate the region culturally  ecologically  politically and  more controversially  racially  from North Africa  which has historically been considered part of the Mediterranean sphere  Because the indigenous people of this region are primarily dark skinned  it is alternatively called  Black Africa   19  However the terminology Black Africa and Sub Sahara Africa is considered by some as a pejorative term and a vestige of colonialism  which divided Africa into European terms of homogeneity  20  Some criticize the use of the term  because  as it has become in many quarters synonymous with Black Africa  people may not realize that there are also indigenous black populations in North Africa  In addition  the Sahara cuts across countries such as Mauritania  Mali  Niger  and Chad  leaving some parts of them in North Africa and some in sub Saharan Africa  Some black Africans prefer to be culturally distinguished from those who live in the north of the continent  21  Cultural ideas of a black race South Africa A Khoisan man  an ethnic group in South Africa  In South Africa during the apartheid era  the population was classified into four main racial groups  Black  White  Asian  mostly Indian   and Coloured  The Coloured group included people of mixed Bantu  Khoisan  and European descent  with some Malay ancestry  especially in the Western Cape   The Coloured definition occupied an intermediary position between the Black and White definitions in South Africa  The apartheid bureaucracy devised complex  and often arbitrary  criteria in the Population Registration Act to determine who belonged in which group  Minor officials administered tests to enforce the classifications  When it was unclear from a person s physical appearance whether a person was to be considered Colored or Black  the  pencil test  was employed  This involved inserting a pencil in a person s hair to determine if the hair was kinky enough for the pencil to get stuck  22  During the apartheid era  those classed as  Coloured  were oppressed and discriminated against  But  they had limited rights and overall had slightly better socioeconomic conditions than those classed as  Black   In the post apartheid era  the ANC government s laws in support of their affirmative action policies define  Black  people to include  Africans    Coloureds  and  Asians   Their affirmative action policies have also favored  Africans  over  Coloureds   Some South Africans categorized as  African Black  openly state that  Coloureds  did not suffer as much as they did during apartheid  The popular saying by  Coloured  South Africans to illustrate their dilemma is  We were not white enough under apartheid  and we are not black enough under the ANC  African National Congress  In 2008  the High Court in South Africa ruled that Chinese South Africans who were residents during the apartheid era  and their descendents  are to be reclassified as  Black people  solely for the purposes of accessing affirmative action benefits  because they were also  disadvantaged  by racial discrimination  Chinese people who arrived in the country after the end of apartheid do not qualify  23  Other than by appearance   Coloureds  can usually be distinguished from  Blacks  by language  Most speak Afrikaans or English as a first language  as opposed to Bantu languages such as Zulu or Xhosa  They also tend to have more European sounding names than Bantu names  24  In the Middle East Near East and North Africa See also  Afro Arab Black African and Near Eastern peoples have interacted since prehistoric times  25  26  Some historians estimate that as many as 14 million black slaves were transported across the Red Sea  Indian Ocean  and Sahara Desert in the Arab slave trade from 650 to 1900 CE  27  28  The Moroccan Sultan Moulay Ismail  the Bloodthirsty   1672 1727  raised a corps of 150 000 black slaves  called his Black Guard  who coerced the country into submission  29  30  13th century slave market in Yemen  Yemen officially abolished slavery in 1962  31  In more recent times  about 1000 CE  interactions between black people and Arabs resulted in the incorporation of extensive Arabic vocabulary into Swahili  which became a useful lingua franca for merchants  Some of this linguistic exchange occurred as part of the slave trade  the history of Islam and slavery shows that the major juristic schools traditionally accepted the institution of slavery  32  As a result  Arab influence spread along the east coast of Africa and to some extent into the interior  see Swahili people   Timbuktu was a trading outpost that linked West Africa with Berber  Arab  and Jewish traders throughout the Arab World  As a result of these interactions  some female mediated gene flow into the Middle East from Sub Saharan Africa can be observed in certain populations  33  According to Dr  Carlos Moore  resident scholar at Brazil s University of the state of Bahia  Afro multiracials in the Arab world self identify in ways that resemble Latin America  He claims that black looking Arabs  much like black looking Latin Americans  consider themselves white because they have some distant white ancestry  34  Soldiers of the Free Arabian Legion in Greece  September 1943  Moore also claims that a film about Egyptian President Anwar Sadat had to be canceled when Sadat discovered that an African American had been cast to play him  In fact  the 1983 television movie Sadat  starring Louis Gossett  Jr   was not canceled  The Egyptian government refused to let the drama air in Egypt  partially on the grounds of the casting of Gossett  35  Sadat s mother was a dark skinned Sudanese woman and his father was a lighter skinned Egyptian  In response to an advertisement for an acting position he remarked   I am not white but I am not exactly black either  My blackness is tending to reddish   36  Fathia Nkrumah was another Egyptian with ties to Black Africa  She was the late wife of Ghanaian revolutionary Kwame Nkrumah  whose marriage was seen as helping plant the seeds of cooperation between Egypt and other African countries as they struggled for independence from European colonization  This helped advance the formation of the African Union  37  Bashi bazouk of the Ottoman Empire by Jean L on G r me  1869 Because of the patriarchal nature of Arab society  Arab men enslaved more black women than men  and used more black female slaves than males  The men interpreted the Qur an to permit sexual relations between a male master and his female slave outside of marriage  38  39  leading to many mixed race children  When an enslaved woman became pregnant with her Arab master s child  she became umm walad or  mother of a child   a status that granted her privileged rights  The child was allowed to prosper from the wealth of the father and was given rights of inheritance  40  Because the society was patrilineal  the children took their fathers  status at birth and were born free  Some succeeded their fathers as rulers  as was the case with Sultan Ahmad al Mansur  who ruled Morocco from 1578 to 1608  His mother was a Fulani concubine of his father  Such tolerance  however  was not extended to wholly black persons  even when technically  free   Arabs commonly believed that blacks were slaves  41  The term  abd    Arabic          slave   remains a common term for black people in the Middle East  and  depending on the context  usually though not always derogatory  42  Turkey See also  Afro Turks Beginning several centuries ago  a number of sub Saharan Africans were brought by slave traders during the Ottoman Empire to plantations between Antalya and Istanbul in modern day Turkey  43  Some of their descendants remain  mixed with the rest of the population in these areas  and many migrated to larger cities  Some came from the island of Crete following the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923  44  Israel An African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem child in Dimona  About 150 000 black people live in Israel  amounting to just over 2  of the nation s population  The vast majority of these  some 120 000  are Beta Israel  45  most of whom came during the 1980s and 1990s from Ethiopia  46  In addition  Israel is home to over 5 000 members of the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem movement  who reside mainly in a distinct neighborhood in the Negev town of Dimona  Unknown numbers of black converts to Judaism reside in Israel  most of them converts from the UK  Canada  and the United States  Thousands of mixed race individuals with non black Jewish relatives also live in Israel  In the Americas See also  Afro American peoples of the Americas Approximately 12 million Africans were shipped to the Americas during the Atlantic slave trade from 1492 to 1888  Today their descendants number approximately 150 million  47  most of whom live in the United States  the Caribbean and Latin America  Most notably Brazil has the largest population in the world  aside from Nigeria  of individuals of at least partial African descent  Many have a multiracial background of African  Amerindian  European and Asian ancestry  The various regions developed complex social conventions with which their multi ethnic populations were classified  United States Main article  African American Harriet Tubman  an African American abolitionist and conductor of the Underground Railroad  In the first 200 years that black people were in the United States  they commonly referred to themselves as Africans  In Africa  people primarily identified themselves by ethnic group  closely allied to language  and not by skin color  Individuals would be Ashanti  Igbo  Bakongo or Wolof  But when Africans were brought to the Americas  they were forced to give up their ethnic affiliations when they were combined with other groups from Africa  In areas of the Upper South  different ethnic groups were brought together  This is significant as Africans came from a vast geographic region  the West African coastline stretching from Senegal to Angola and in some cases from the south east coast such as Mozambique  A new identity and culture was born that incorporated elements of the various ethnic groups and of European cultural heritage  resulting in fusions such as the Black church and Black English  This new identity was based on African ancestry and slave status rather than any one ethnic group  48  In March 1807  Britain  which largely controlled the Atlantic  declared the trans atlantic slave trade illegal  as did the United States   The latter prohibition took effect January 1  1808  the earliest date on which Congress had the power to do so under Article I  Section 9 of the United States Constitution   By that time  the majority of black people were U S  born  so use of the term  African  became problematic  Though initially a source of pride  many blacks feared the use of African as an identity would be a hindrance to their fight for full citizenship in the US  They also felt that it would give ammunition to those who were advocating repatriating black people back to Africa  In 1835 black leaders called upon black Americans to remove the title of  African  from their institutions and replace it with  Negro  or  Colored American   A few institutions chose to keep their historic names  such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church   Negro  and  colored  remained the popular terms until the late 1960s  49  The term black was used throughout but not frequently as it carried a certain stigma  In his 1963  I Have a Dream  speech  50 Martin Luther King  Jr  uses the terms Negro 15 times and black four times  Each time he uses black it is in parallel construction with white  for example   black men and white men   51  With the successes of the civil rights movement  a new term was needed to break from the past and help shed the reminders of legalized discrimination  In place of Negro  activists promoted the use of black as standing for racial pride  militancy and power  Some of the turning points included the use of the term  Black Power  by Kwame Toure  Stokely Carmichael  and the release of James Brown s song  Say It Loud   I m Black and I m Proud   African American Michael Jordan  considered by many the greatest basketball player in history  In 1988 Jesse Jackson urged Americans to use the term African American because the term has a historical cultural base  Since then African American and black have essentially a coequal status  Controversy continues over which term is more appropriate  Some such as Maulana Karenga and Owen Alik Shahadah argue African American is more appropriate because it accurately articulates geography and historical origin  48  Others have argued that  black  is a better term because  African  suggests foreignness  despite the long presence of black people in the US  52  Still others believe the term black is inaccurate because African Americans have a variety of skin tones  citation needed  Surveys show that the majority of black Americans have no preference for  African American  or  Black   53  although they have a slight preference for  black  in personal settings and  African American  in more formal settings  54  Increases in the number of immigrants to the United States from Africa  the Caribbean and Latin America have brought up questions about who uses the term African American  The more recent African immigrants may sometimes view themselves  and be viewed  as culturally distinct from native born people who are descendants of African slaves  55  The U S  census race definitions says a black is a person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa  It includes people who indicate their race as  Black  African Am   or Negro   or who provide written entries such as African American  Afro American  Kenyan  Nigerian  or Haitian  However  the Census Bureau notes that these classifications are socio political constructs and should not be interpreted as scientific or anthropological  56  A considerable portion of the U S  population identified as black also has some Native American or European ancestry  For instance  genetic studies of African American people show an ancestry that is on average 17 18  European  57  One drop rule Since the late nineteenth century  the South used a colloquial term  the one drop rule  to classify as black a person of any known African ancestry  This practice of hypodescent was not put into law until the early twentieth century  58  Legally the definition varied from state to state  and was more flexible in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before the American Civil War  For instance  Thomas Jefferson held persons who were legally white  less than 25  Black  according to Virginia law at the time  but  because they were born to slave mothers  they were born into slavery  according to the principle of partus sequitur ventrem  which Virginia adopted into law in 1662  Outside of the US  some other countries have adopted the one drop rule  but the definition of who is black and the extent to which the one drop  rule  applies varies greatly from country to country  The one drop rule may have originated as a means of increasing the number of black slaves 59  and been maintained as an attempt to keep the white race pure  60  One of the results of the one drop rule was uniting the African American community  58  Some of the most prominent civil rights activists were multiracial  and advocated equality for all  citation needed  Blackness Barack Obama  the first black president of the United States  was throughout his campaign criticized as being either  too black  or  not black enough   61  62  63  The concept of blackness in the United States has been described by whom   as the degree to which one associates themselves with mainstream African American culture and values  To a certain extent  this concept is not so much about race but more about culture and behavior  Blackness can be contrasted with  acting white   where black Americans are said to behave with assumed characteristics of stereotypical white Americans  with regard to fashion  dialect  taste in music  64  and possibly  from the perspective of a significant number of black youth  academic achievement  65  The notion of blackness can also be extended to non black people  Toni Morrison once described Bill Clinton as the first black president  66  because of his warm relations with African Americans  his poor upbringing and also because he is a jazz musician  Christopher Hitchens was offended by the notion of Clinton as the first black president noting  we can still define blackness by the following symptoms  alcoholic mothers  under the bridge habits   the tendency to sexual predation and shameless perjury about the same   Some black activists were also offended  claiming Clinton used his knowledge of black culture to exploit black people like no other president before 67  for political gain  while not serving black interests  They note his lack of action during the Rwanda genocide 68  and his welfare reform which some claim led to the worst child poverty since the 1960s 69  along with the fact that the number of black people in jail increased during his administration  70  The question of blackness also arose in Democrat Barack Obama s 2008 presidential campaign  Commentators have questioned whether Obama  who was elected the first black President of the United States  is black enough  as his mother was white American  and his father was a black Kenyan immigrant  61  63  Obama refers to himself interchangeably as black and African American  71   Is Barack Obama the first black President of the United States   72  Brazil Main article  Race in Brazil The topic of race in Brazil is a complex and diverse one  citation needed  A Brazilian child was never automatically identified with the racial type of one or both parents  nor were there only two categories to choose from  Between a pure black and a very light mulatto over a dozen racial categories would be recognized in conformity with the combinations of hair color  hair texture  eye color  and skin color  These types grade into each other like the colors of the spectrum  and no one category stands significantly isolated from the rest  That is  race referred to appearance  not heredity  73  Jongo  a Brazilian dance of African origin  c  1822 There is some disagreement among scholars over the effects of social status on racial classifications in Brazil  It is generally believed that upward mobility and education results in reclassification of individuals into lighter skinned categories  The popular claim is that in Brazil poor whites are considered black and wealthy blacks are considered white  Some scholars disagree arguing that whitening of one s social status may be open to people of mixed race  but a typically black person will consistently be identified as black regardless of wealth or social status  74  75  Multiracial persons can even reappreciate their African heritage and start to declare themselves as black persons with increasings of social status and education  Statistics See also  Race and genetics Admixture in Latin America Brazilian Population  by Race  from 1872 to 1991  Census Data  76

million Africans were forcibly shipped to Brazil  74  It is estimated that more than half of the Brazilian population is at least in part descendants of these Africans  Brazil has the largest population of Afro descendants outside of Africa  In contrast to the US there were no segregation or anti miscegenation laws in Brazil and as a result intermarriage has affected a large majority of the Brazilian population  Even much of the white Asian population has either African or Amerindian blood  According to the last census of the twentieth century 54  identified themselves as white  6 2  identified themselves as black and 39 5  identified themselves as Pardo  brown    a broad multiracial category  77  A philosophy of whitening emerged in Brazil in the nineteenth century  Until recently the government did not keep data on race  However  statisticians estimate that in 1835 half the population was black  one fifth was Pardo  brown  and one fourth white  By 2000 the black population had fallen to only 6 2  and the Pardo had increased to 40  and white to 55   Essentially most of the black population was absorbed into the multiracial category by intermixing  73  A recent study found that at least 29  of the middle class white Brazilian population had some recent African ancestry  78  Race relations in Brazil Afro Brazilian women during a Candombl  ceremony  Because of the ideology of miscegenation  Brazil has avoided the polarization of society into black and white  The bitter and sometimes violent racial tensions that divide the US are notably absent in Brazil  According to the census  6 7  of Brazilians said they were black  compared with 6 2  in 2000  and 43 1  said they were mixed race  up from 38 5   According to Brazil s minister for racial equality  Elio Ferreira de Araujo  attributed the change to growing pride among his country s black and indigenous communities  79  However  the philosophy of the racial democracy in Brazil has drawn criticism from some quarters  Brazil has one of the largest gaps in income distribution in the world  The richest 10  of the population earn 28 times the average income of the bottom 40   The richest 10 percent is almost exclusively white  One third of the population lives under the poverty line  with blacks and other non whites accounting for 70 percent of the poor  80  Fruit sellers in Rio de Janeiro c  1820 In the US  black people earn 75  of what white people earn  81  In Brazil  non whites earn less than 50  of what whites earn  Some have posited that Brazil does in fact practice the one drop rule when social economic factors are considered  This is because the gap in income between blacks and other non whites is relatively small compared to the large gap between whites and non whites  Other factors such as illiteracy and education level show the same patterns  82  Unlike in the US where African Americans were united in the civil rights struggle  in Brazil the philosophy of whitening has helped divide blacks from other non whites and prevented a more active civil rights movement  Though Brazilians of African heritage make up a large percentage  83  the population there are very few black politicians  The city of Salvador  Bahia  for instance  is 80  Afro Brazilian but has never had a black mayor  Critics indicate that US cities that have a black majority  such as Detroit and New Orleans  have never had white mayors since first electing black mayors in the 1970s  79  84  Black people in Brazil c  1821 Non white people also have limited media visibility  The Latin American media  in particular the Brazilian media  has been accused of hiding its Black  Indigenous  Multiracial and East Asian population  For example the telenovelas or soaps are said to be a hotbed of largely light eyed white and light skinned mulattoes and mestizos  often deemed as white persons in Brazil if achieving the middle class or higher social status  actors  Most rare empowered persons of color represented in Latin American media possess typically Caucasian features due to a mix of racist standards of beauty  colourism and lookism  Nevertheless  in the last years  the number of empowered afrodescendants  either economically or by other ways  increased in Brazilian media coverage  Despite Brazil also possessing criminal black man stereotypes  it is considered a huge prejudice and mostly not used in a disordered way by the media  in spite of sometimes common  humouristic  sexist jokes and LGBT stereotyping  85  and as such lack of politically correctness in native race issues is not a major problem  there are way more stereotypes of Asian people  Europeans or U S  Americans  for example   These patterns of discrimination against non whites have led some to advocate for the use of the Portuguese term  negro  to encompass non whites so as to renew a black consciousness and identity  in effect an African descent rule  86  It generates criticism since Pardo  or Brown people  is intended to include caboclos  mestizos   assimilated Amerindians and tri racials  not only afrodescendants   thus Brazilian of some or no recent African descent  as most White Brazilians  become 60 70  of the population  breaking the argument of possible Brazilian one drop rule since real noticeable mulattoes  cafuzos  zambos  and black persons are a minority and the Brazilian poor represents larger percents in Brazil  As one would expect from an underdeveloped country  there are pockets of poverty in White majority and Japanese Brazilian majority areas  rarer in urban developments but common in rural areas  They are even more common among Mestizo majority areas  and Amerindian communities  In Asia and Australasia Siddi folk dancers performing at Devaliya Naka  Sasan Gir  Gujarat  China As of August  2008  The Migration Information Source article noted that  A Nigerian Embassy spokesman estimated that Nigerians possibly make up the largest group of Black Africans in China  with about 2 000 to 3 000 Nigerians in Guangdong in 2006  Most businessmen only stay temporarily   87  88  An ethnic Ati woman of the Philippines  The Negritos were the earliest inhabitants of Southeast Asia  India and Southeast Asia See also  Indo African  disambiguation  The Great Andamanese are one of five Negrito ethnic groups  Adivasi or tribal  native to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands  they are among the first inhabitants of what is now India  arriving over 70 000 years ago  They are facing extinction  89  The other four ethnic groups are the Jangil  Jarawa  Onge and Sentinelese  By their external physical appearance  phenotype  such people resemble Black Africans with dark skin and sometimes tightly coiled hair  There have been suggestions of a Black African origin  However  in the case of the Andamanese people  a study conducted by the NCBI indicated that the Andamanese people possessed closer affinities with the Southeast Asian population than with the Black African population  90  In South India there are also several communities of Black African descent  such as the Sheedis Siddis  specifically the Siddis of Karnataka  who descend from Black African slaves  In Pakistan  these descendants are known as the Makrani  Other black people of Southeast Asia  collectively known as Negritos  include the Semang peoples of Malaysia  the Mani of Thailand the Aeta of Luzon and the Ati of Panay in the Philippines  91  Melanesia There are several groups of dark skinned people who live in various parts of Asia  Australia and Oceania who sometimes are referred to as black people  They include the Indigenous Australians  the Melanesians  now divided into Austronesian speaking populations and Papuans  and including the great genetic diversity of New Guinea   the Semang people of the Malay peninsula  and indigenous first nation Fijians  They are as genetically  anthropologically and culturally related to Africans only as much as all other non Africans are related to Africans  and because of this it has been deemed controversial to label them black people in the sense of some relation to the native African peoples and the African diaspora
