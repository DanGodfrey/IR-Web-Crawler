and 1940s American cartoon shorts were produced in Technicolor  Technicolor is a color motion picture process invented in 1916 and improved over several decades  1  It was the second major process  after Britain s Kinemacolor  and the most widely used color process in Hollywood from 1922 to 1952  Technicolor became known and celebrated for its saturated levels of color  and was used most commonly for filming musicals such as The Wizard of Oz and Singin  in the Rain  costume pictures such as The Adventures of Robin Hood and Joan of Arc  and animated films such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Fantasia  However  it was also used for less spectacular dramas and comedies  and sometimes even a Film noir such as Leave Her to Heaven or Niagara was filmed in Technicolor   Technicolor  is the trademark for a series of color motion picture processes pioneered by Technicolor Motion Picture Corporation  a subsidiary of Technicolor  Inc    now a division of Technicolor SA  The Technicolor Motion Picture Corporation was founded in Boston in 1914  incorporated in Maine in 1915  by Herbert Kalmus  Daniel Frost Comstock  and W  Burton Wescott  2  The  Tech  in the company s

four concepts  Technicolor process format  the several image origination systems used in film production  which culminated in the  three strip  process   1917 1954  Technicolor dye imbibition printing  or  dye transfer    a process for making color motion picture prints that allows the use of dyes which are more stable and permanent than those created in chromogenic printing processes  Originally used for printing from color separation negatives photographed on black and white film in a Technicolor camera  it was later applied to making prints from negatives photographed on standard color film in an ordinary camera   1928 2002  with differing gaps of availability post 1974 depending on lab  Technicolor labs  a collection of film laboratories across the world owned and run by Technicolor for post production services including developing  printing  and transferring films in all major developing processes  as well as Technicolor s proprietary ones  Films using these labs thus retain a  Color by Technicolor  credit even though no Technicolor format or printing have been offered recently   1922 present  Technicolor  an umbrella company encompassing all the above as well as other ancillary services   1914 present   edit  History  edit  Two color Technicolor  edit  Process 1 Technicolor originally existed in a two color  red and green  system  In Process 1  1916   a prism beam splitter behind the camera lens exposed two consecutive frames of a single strip of black and white negative film simultaneously  one behind a red filter  the other behind a green filter  Because two frames were being exposed at the same time  the film had to be photographed and projected at twice the normal speed  Exhibition required a special projector with two apertures  one with a red filter and the other with a green filter   two lenses  and an adjustable prism that aligned the two images on the screen  6  The results were first demonstrated to members of the American Institute of Mining Engineers in New York on February 21  1917  7  Technicolor itself produced the only movie made in Process 1  The Gulf Between  which had a limited tour of Eastern cities  beginning with Boston and New York in September 1917  primarily to interest motion picture producers and exhibitors in color  The near constant need for a technician to adjust the projection alignment doomed this additive color process  Only a few frames of The Gulf Between  showing star Grace Darmond  are known to exist today  Frame from the Technicolor picture The Toll of the Sea  1922   edit  Process 2 Convinced that there was no future in additive color processes  Kalmus focused his attention on subtractive color processes  This culminated in what would eventually be known as Process 2  1922   sometimes confusingly called  two strip  8    As before  the special Technicolor camera used a beam splitter that simultaneously exposed two frames of a single strip of black and white film  one behind a green filter and one behind a red filter  9  The difference was that the two component negative was now used to produce a subtractive color print  Because the colors were physically present in the print  no special projection equipment was required and the correct registration of the two images did not depend on the skill of the projectionist  The frames exposed behind the green filter were printed on one strip of black and white film  and the frames exposed behind the red filter were printed on another strip  After development  each strip was toned to a color complementary to that of the filter red for the green filtered images  green for the red filtered  Unlike tinting  which adds a uniform veil of color to the entire image  toning chemically replaces the black and white silver image with transparent coloring matter  so that the highlights remain clear  or nearly so   dark areas are strongly colored  and intermediate tones are colored proportionally  The two strips  made of film stocks thinner than regular film  were then cemented together base to base to create a projection print  The Toll of the Sea debuted on November 26  1922 as the first general release film to use Technicolor  Frame enlargement of a Technicolor segment from The Phantom of the Opera  1925   The film was one of the earliest uses of the process on interior sets  and demonstrated its versatility  The second all color feature in this process  Wanderer of the Wasteland  was released in 1924  Process 2 was also used for color sequences in such major motion pictures as The Ten Commandments  1923   The Phantom of the Opera  1925   and Ben Hur  1925   Douglas Fairbanks  The Black Pirate  1926   became the fourth feature to be filmed entirely in Technicolor  Although successful commercially  Process 2 was plagued with technical problems  Because the images on the two sides of the print were not in the same plane  both could not be perfectly focused at the same time  The significance of this problem depended on the depth of field of the projection optics  Much more serious was a problem with cupping  Films in general tended to become somewhat cupped after repeated use  Every time a film was projected  each frame in turn was heated by the intense light in the projection gate  causing it to bulge slightly  After it had passed through the gate  it cooled and the bulge subsided  but not quite completely  It was found that the cemented prints were not only very prone to cupping  but that the direction of cupping would suddenly and randomly change from back to front or vice versa  so that even the most attentive projectionist could not prevent the image from temporarily popping out of focus whenever the direction changed  Technicolor had to supply new prints so the cupped ones could be shipped to their Boston laboratory for flattening  after which they could be put back into service  at least for a while  The unusual thickness of the film and the presence of image layers on both surfaces made the prints especially vulnerable to scratching  and because the scratches were vividly colored they were very obtrusive  Splicing a Process 2 print without special attention to its unusual laminated construction was apt to result in a bad splice that would fail as it passed through the projector  Even before these problems became apparent  Technicolor regarded this cemented print approach as a stopgap and was already at work developing an improved process  10   edit  Process 3 Based on the same dye transfer technique first applied to motion pictures in 1916 by Max Handschiegl  Technicolor Process 3  1928  was developed to eliminate the projection print made of double cemented prints in favor of a print created by dye imbibition  The Technicolor camera for Process 3 was identical to that for Process 2  simultaneously photographing two consecutive frames of a black and white film behind red and green filters  In the lab  every other frame of the camera negative was printed onto one strip of specially prepared gelatin film  or  matrix   to create a red record  and the remaining frames were printed onto a second strip of blank film to create a green record  On exposure to UV light  the gelatin hardened  Areas not exposed to light were washed away by the developer leaving a relief image created by the hardened gelatin  The two matrix films were then soaked in dye baths of their complementary colors  The strip containing the red record was dyed green and the green record strip was dyed red  The thicker the gelatin on each frame  the more dye it absorbed  During the final printing  the matrices were placed in contact with a blank  emulsified strip of film  known as the  blank   and the dye was transferred from the matrices to the new print  A mordant made from deacetylated Chitin was applied to the blank before printing  which kept the dye from migrating  As this dye transfer process was introduced around the same time as sound on film  the emulsion on the blank was adapted to a black and white film stock where the soundtrack and frame line were printed in black and white first  and then the dye layer was added  A frame of On With the Show  1929   found in 2005  No complete color copies of the film have survived  The first feature made entirely in the Technicolor Process 3 was The Viking  1928   which had a synchronized score and sound effects  Redskin  1929   with a synchronized score  and The Mysterious Island  1929   a part talkie  were photographed almost entirely in this process also but included some sequences in black and white  The following talkies were made entirely   or almost entirely   in Technicolor Process 3  On with the Show   1929   the first all talking color feature   Gold Diggers of Broadway  1929   The Show of Shows  1929   Sally  1929   The Vagabond King  1930   Follow Thru  1930   Golden Dawn  1930   Hold Everything  1930   The Rogue Song  1930   Song of the Flame  1930   Song of the West  1930   The Life of the Party  1930   Sweet Kitty Bellairs  1930   Bride of the Regiment  1930   Mamba  1930   Whoopee   1930   King of Jazz  1930   Under a Texas Moon  1930   Bright Lights  1930   Viennese Nights  1930   Woman Hungry  1931   Kiss Me Again  1931  and Fifty Million Frenchmen  1931   In addition  scores of features were released with Technicolor sequences  Numerous short subjects were also photographed in Technicolor Process 3  including the first color sound cartoons by producers such as Ub Iwerks and Walter Lantz  Song of the Flame became the first color movie to use a widescreen process  using a system known as Vitascope  which used 65mm film   In 1931  an improvement of Technicolor Process 3 was developed which removed grain from the Technicolor film  resulting in more vivid and vibrant colors  11  This process was first used on a Radio Picture entitled  The Runaround  1931   The new process not only improved the color but also removed specks  that looked like bugs  from the screen  which had previously blurred outlines and lowered visibility  This new improvement along with a reduction in cost  from 8 85 cents to 7 cents per foot  led to a new color revival  12 Warner Brothers took the lead once again by producing three features  out of an announced plan for six features   Manhattan Parade  1932   Doctor X  1932  and Mystery of the Wax Museum  1933   Radio Pictures followed by announcing plans to make four more features in the new process  13  Only one of these  Fanny Foley Herself  1931   was actually produced  Although Paramount Pictures announced plans to make eight features and Metro Goldwyn Mayer promised two color features  these never materialized  14  This may have been the result of the lukewarm reception to these new color pictures by the public  Two independently produced features were also made with this improved Technicolor process  Legong  Dance of the Virgins  1934  and Kliou the Tiger  1935   Very few of the original camera negatives of movies made in Technicolor Process 2 or 3 survive  In the late 1940s  most were discarded from storage at Technicolor in a space clearing move  after the studios declined to reclaim the materials  Original Technicolor prints that survived into the 1950s were often used to make black and white prints for television and simply discarded thereafter  This explains why so many early color films exist today solely in black and white  Warner Bros   which had vaulted from a minor exhibitor to a major studio by its introduction of the talkies  incorporated Technicolor s printing to enhance their films  Other producers followed Warner Bros   example by making features in color  with either Technicolor or one of its competitors  such as Brewster Color and Multicolor  later Cinecolor   Consequently  the introduction of color did not increase the number of audiences to the point where it was economical  This  and the Great Depression severely strained movie studios  finances  and spelled the end of Technicolor s first financial success   edit  Three strip Technicolor  edit  Process 4  Development and introduction As early as 1924  Technicolor envisioned a full color process  and by 1929  the company was actively developing such a process  Hollywood made so much use of Technicolor in 1929 and 1930  that many believed the feature film industry would soon be turning out color films exclusively  By 1931  the Great Depression took its toll on the movie industry  and they began to cut back on expenses  The production of color films had decreased dramatically by 1932  when Burton Wescott and Joseph A  Ball completed work on a new three color movie camera  Technicolor could now promise studios a full range of colors  as opposed to the limited red green spectrum of previous films  The light passing through the camera lens was split into two beam paths by a prism block  Green light was recorded through a green filter on panchromatic film  while the other half of the light passed through a magenta filter and was recorded on bipack film stock with two strips running base to base  On this stock  the front film was sensitized to blue light only  backed by a red gelatin layer which acted as a light filter to the panchromatic film behind it  This process accurately reproduced the full color spectrum when optically printed using a dye transfer process in cyan  magenta and yellow  Kalmus convinced Walt Disney to shoot one of his Silly Symphony cartoons Flowers and Trees  1932  in Process 4  the new  three strip  process  Seeing the potential in full color Technicolor  Walt Disney negotiated an exclusive contract for the use of the process  continuing to September 1935  when other studios could start producing cartoons in the process  but were barred from releasing them until 1936   15  16  17  Competitors such as the Fleischer Studios and the Ub Iwerks studio were shut out   they had to settle for either the two color Technicolor systems or use a competing process such as Cinecolor  Flowers and Trees was a success with audiences and critics alike  and won the first Academy Award for Animated Short Film  All subsequent Silly Symphonies from 1933 on were shot with the three strip process  One 1933 Silly Symphony  Three Little Pigs  engendered such a positive audience response that it overshadowed the feature films with which it was shown  Hollywood was buzzing about color film again  According to Fortune magazine   Merian C  Cooper  producer for RKO Radio Pictures and director of King Kong  1933   saw one of the Silly Symphonies and said he never wanted to make a black and white picture again   Although Disney s first 60 or so Technicolor cartoons used the three strip camera  an improved  successive exposure  process was adopted circa 1937 mainly for cartoon work  the camera would contain one strip of black and white negative film  and each animation cel would be photographed three times  on three sequential frames  behind alternating red  green  and blue filters  the so called  Technicolor Color Wheel   then an option of the Acme  Producers Service and Photo Sonics animation cameras   18  Three separate dye transfer printing matrices would be created from the red  green  and blue records in their respective complementary colors  cyan  magenta and yellow  Successive Exposure was also employed in Disney s  True Life Adventure  live action series  wherein the 16mm Kodachrome Commercial principal photography element was first duplicated onto a 35mm fine grain SE negative element in one pass of the 16mm element  thereby reducing wear on the relatively small 16mm element and also eliminating registration errors between colors  The live action SE negative thereafter entered other Technicolor processes and were incorporated with SE animation and three strip studio live action  as required  thereby producing the combined result   edit  Shooting Technicolor footage  1932 1955 Three strip Technicolor camera from the 1930s Technicolor s advantage over most early natural color processes was that it was a subtractive synthesis rather than an additive one  Technicolor prints could run on any projector  unlike other additive processes  it could represent colors clearly without any special projection equipment or techniques  More importantly  Technicolor held the best balance between a quality image and speed of printing  compared to other subtractive systems of the time  The Technicolor Process 4 used colored filters  a beam splitter made from a thinly coated mirror inside a split cube prism  and three strips of black and white film  hence the  three strip  designation   The beam splitter allowed   of the light to shine through a green filter onto one strip of film  capturing the green part of the image  The other   was reflected sideways by the mirror and passed through a magenta filter  to remove any green  which would have been redundant   The diverted non green light exposed a pair of film strips spooled together  one which captured only blues  itself a filter  and another which picked up whatever was left  the red part of the image   The  blue  strip could act as a filter because it was a special type of film known as orthochromatic  which is designed to absorb some light frequencies and not others  The  green  and  red  strips were both of the broad spectrum  panchromatic type  To print the film  each colored strip had a print struck from it onto a light sensitive piece of gelatin film  When processed   dark  portions of the film hardened  and light areas were washed away  The gelatin film strip was then soaked with a dye complementary to the color recorded by the film  cyan for red  magenta for green  and yellow for blue  see also  CMYK color model for a technical discussion of color printing   A single clear strip of black and white film with the soundtrack and frame lines printed in advance was first treated with a mordant solution and then brought into contact with each of the three dye loaded printing strips in turn  building up the complete color image  Each dye was absorbed  or imbibed  by the gelatin coating on the receiving strip rather than simply deposited onto its surface  hence the term  dye imbibition   Strictly speaking  this is a mechanical printing process  very loosely comparable to offset printing or lithography  and not a photographic one  as the actual printing does not involve a chemical change caused by exposure to light  In the early days of the process  the un exposed blank receiver film would be pre exposed with a 50  black and white image derived from the green strip  the so called Key  or K  record  This process was used largely to cover up fine edges in the picture where colors would mix unrealistically  also known as fringing   This additional black increased the contrast of the final print and concealed any fringing  However  overall colorfulness was compromised as a result  In 1944  Technicolor had improved the process to make up for these shortcomings and the K record was  therefore  eliminated   edit  Convincing Hollywood The studios were willing to adopt three color Technicolor for live action feature production  if it could be proved viable  Shooting three strip Technicolor required very bright lighting  as the film had an extremely slow speed of ASA 5  That  and the bulk of the cameras and a lack of experience with three color cinematography made for skepticism in the studio board rooms  Fortune magazine s October 1934 article stressed that Technicolor  as a corporation  was rather remarkable in that it kept its investors quite happy despite the fact that it had only been in profit twice in all of the years of its existence  during the early boom at the turn of the decade  A well managed company  half of whose stock was controlled by a clique loyal to Kalmus  Technicolor never had to cede any control to its bankers or unfriendly stockholders  In the mid  30s  all the major studios except MGM were in the financial doldrums  and a color process that truly reproduced the visual spectrum was seen as a possible shot in the arm for the ailing industry  In November 1933  Technicolor s Herbert Kalmus and RKO announced plans to produce three strip Technicolor films in 1934  beginning with Ann Harding starring in a projected film The World Outside  19  Live action use of three strip Technicolor was first seen in a musical number of the MGM feature The Cat and the Fiddle  released February 16  1934  On July 1  MGM released Hollywood Party with a Technicolor cartoon sequence  Hot Choc late Soldiers  produced by Walt Disney  On July 28 of that year  Warner Brothers released Service With a Smile  followed by Good Morning  Eve  on August 5  both being comedy short films starring Leon Errol and filmed in three strip Technicolor  Pioneer Pictures  a movie company formed by Technicolor investors  produced the film usually credited as the first live action short film shot in the three strip process  La Cucaracha released August 31  1934  La Cucaracha is a two reel musical comedy that cost  65 000  approximately four times what an equivalent black and white two reeler would cost  Released by RKO  the short was a success in introducing the new Technicolor as a viable medium for live action films  The three strip process also was used in some short sequences filmed for several movies made during 1934  including the final sequences of The House of Rothschild  20th Century Pictures United Artists  with George Arliss and Kid Millions  Samuel Goldwyn Studios  with Eddie Cantor  Pioneer RKO s Becky Sharp  1935  became the first feature film photographed entirely in three strip Technicolor  Initially  three strip Technicolor was only used indoors  In 1936  The Trail of the Lonesome Pine became the first production to have outdoor sequences  with impressive results  The spectacular success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs  1937   which was released in December 1937 and became the top grossing film of 1938  attracted the attention of the studios   edit  Limitations and difficulties One major drawback of Technicolor s three strip process was that it required a special  bulky  and very heavy Technicolor camera  Film studios could not purchase Technicolor cameras  only rent them for their productions  complete with camera technicians and a  color supervisor  to ensure sets  costumes and makeup didn t push beyond the limitations of the system  Often on many early productions  the supervisor was Natalie Kalmus  ex wife of Herbert Kalmus and part owner of the company  Directors had great difficulty with her  Vincente Minnelli said   I couldn t do anything right in Mrs  Kalmus s eyes   20  The process of splitting the image reduced the amount of light reaching the film stock  Since the film speed of the stocks used were fairly slow  early Technicolor productions required a greater amount of lighting than a black and white production  It is reported that temperatures on the film set of The Wizard of Oz from the hot studio lights frequently exceeded 100  F  38  C   and some of the more heavily costumed characters required a large water intake  Some actors and actresses claimed to have suffered permanent eye damage from the high levels of illumination  21  Because of the added lighting and triple amount of film necessary  Technicolor demanded high film budgets   edit  The introduction of Eastmancolor and decline This section includes a

2010  Gentlemen Prefer Blondes  an example of Technicolor filming in 1950s Hollywood  Color films that recorded the three primary colors in three emulsion layers on one strip of film had been introduced in the mid 1930s by Eastman Kodak in the United States  Kodachrome for 16mm home movies in 1935  then for 8mm home movies and 35mm slides in 1936  and Agfa in Germany  Agfacolor Neu for both home movies and slides later in 1936   Technicolor introduced Monopack  a single strip color reversal film  a 35 mm version of Kodachrome Commercial  in 1941 for use on location where the bulky three strip camera was impractical  but the higher grain of the image made it unsuitable for studio work  Eastman Kodak introduced its first 35 mm color motion picture negative film in 1950  The first commercial feature film to use Eastmancolor was the National Film Board of Canada documentary Royal Journey  released in December 1951  22  23  In 1952  an improved version suitable for Hollywood production was introduced  24  This allowed Technicolor prints to be struck from a single camera negative exposed in a standard camera  Foxfire  1955   filmed in 1954 by Universal  starring Jane Russell and Jeff Chandler  was the last American made feature photographed with a Technicolor three strip camera  In 1952  Eastman Kodak introduced a high quality color print film  allowing studios to produce prints through standard photographic processes as opposed to having to send them to Technicolor for the expensive dye imbibition process  That same year  the Technicolor lab adapted its dye transfer process to derive matrices and imbibition prints directly from Eastmancolor negatives  as well as other stocks such as Ansco and DuPont color stocks  Technicolor unveiled their stereoscopic camera for 3 D films in March 1953  The rig used two three strip cameras  running a total of six strips of film at once  three for the left eye and three for the right   25  Only two films were shot with this camera set up  Flight to Tangier  1953  and the Martin and Lewis comedy Money From Home  1954   A similar  but different system had been used by a different company  using two three strip cameras side by side for a British short called Royal River  In 1954  Technicolor made reduction dye transfer prints of the large format VistaVision negative  Their process was also adapted for use with Todd AO  Ultra Panavision 70 and Technirama formats  All of them were an improvement over the three strip negatives since the negative print downs generated sharper and finer grain dye transfer copies  By the late 1960s  the dye transfer process eventually fell out of favor in the United States as being too expensive and too slow in turning out prints  With the growing number of screens in the US  the standard run of 200 250 prints increased  And while dye transfer printing yielded superior color printing  the number of high speed prints that could be struck in labs all over the country outweighed the fewer  slower number of prints that could only be had in Technicolor s labs  The last American film released before Technicolor closed their dye plant was The Godfather  Part II  1974   In 1975  the US dye transfer plant was closed and Technicolor became an Eastman only processor  In 1977  the final dye transfer printer left in Rome was used by Dario Argento to make prints for his horror film Suspiria  26  In 1980  the Italian Technicolor plant ceased printing dye transfer  The British line was shut down in 1978 and sold to Beijing Film and Video Lab in China  A great many films from China and Hong Kong were made in the Technicolor dye transfer process  including Zhang Yimou s Ju Dou and even one American film  Space Avenger  1989  director  Richard W  Haines   The Beijing line was shut down in 1993 for a number of reasons  including inferior processing   edit  Reintroduction of the dye transfer process In 1997  Technicolor reintroduced the dye transfer process to general film production  A refined version of the printing process of the 1960s and 1970s  it was used on a limited basis in the restorations of films such as The Wizard of Oz  Rear Window  Funny Girl  and Apocalypse Now Redux  After its reintroduction  the dye transfer process was used in several big budget  modern Hollywood productions  These included Bulworth  Pearl Harbor  and Toy Story  The distinct  look  this process achieves  often sought after by filmmakers looking to re create the period of time at which Technicolor was at its most prominent  is difficult to obtain through conventional  high speed printing methods and is one explanation for the enduring demand and credibility of the process  citation needed  The dye transfer process was discontinued by Technicolor in 2002 after the purchase of the company by Thompson which in 2010 changed its name to Technicolor SA   edit  Dye transfer Technicolor in archival work By the late 1990s the dye transfer process still had its advantages in the film archival community  Because the dye transfer process used stable acid dyes  Technicolor prints are considered of archival quality  A Technicolor print from the dye transfer era will retain its original colors virtually unchanged for decades with proper storage  whereas prints printed on Eastmancolor stocks produced prior to 1983 may suffer color fading after exposure to ultraviolet light and hot  humid conditions as a result of less stable photochemical dyes  Fading on some prints is so rapid that in many cases  after as little as five to ten years  only the magenta record is perceivable on the film  An article 27  on the restoration of Star Wars Episode IV  A New Hope claimed that a rare dye transfer print of the movie  made for director George Lucas at the British Technicolor lab during its initial run  had been used as a color reference for the restoration  The article claimed that conventional color prints of the movie had all degraded over the years to the extent that no two had the same color balance  However  because of the variation in color balance per print  dye transfer prints are used in the professional restoration world as only a rough guideline  Furthermore  three strip camera negatives are all on silver based black and white stock  which have stayed unaltered over the course of time with proper handling  This has become of importance in recent years with the large market for films transferred to video formats for home viewing  The best color quality control for video transfer by far is achieved by optically printing from Technicolor negatives  or by recombining the negative through digital means and printing  onto low contrast stock  One problem that has resulted from Technicolor negatives is the rate of shrinkage from one strip to another  Because three Strip negatives are shot on three rolls  they are subject to different rates of shrinkage depending on storage conditions  Today  digital technology allows for a precise re alignment of the negatives by resizing shrunken negatives digitally to correspond with the other negatives  The G  or Green  record is usually taken as the reference as it is the record with the highest resolution  It is also a record with the correct  wind   emulsion position with respect to the camera s lens   Shrinkage and re alignment  resizing  are non issues with Successive Exposure  single roll RGB  Technicolor camera negatives  This issue could have been eliminated  for three strip titles  had the preservation elements  fine grain positives  been Successive Exposure  but this would have required the preservation elements to be 3 000 feet or 6 000 feet whereas three strip composited camera and preservation elements are 1 000 feet or 2 000 feet  One issue that modern reproduction has had to contend with is that the contrast of the three film strips is not the same  This gives the effect on technicolor prints that  for example  fades cause the color balance of the image to change as the image is faded  Transfer to digital media has attempted to correct the differing color balances and is largely successful  However  a few odd artifacts remain such that saturated parts of the image may show a false color  Where the image of a flame is included in shot  it will rarely be of the expected orange yellow color often being depicted as green   edit  Technicolor today The Technicolor company remained a highly successful film processing firm and later became involved in video and audio duplication  CD  VHS and DVD manufacturing  and digital video processes  MacAndrews  amp  Forbes acquired Technicolor  Inc  in 1982 for  100 million  28  then sold it in 1988 to the British firm Carlton Communications PLC for  780 million  29  Technicolor
