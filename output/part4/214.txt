Native Americans of the Mogollon and the Anasazi cultures  18  52 By the time of European contact in the 16th century  the region was settled by the villages of the Pueblo peoples and groups of Navajo  Apache and Ute  17  6 48 Francisco V zquez de Coronado assembled an enormous expedition at Compostela in 1540 1542 to explore and find the mystical Seven Golden Cities of Cibola as described by Fray Marcos de Niza  18  19 24 The name Nuevo M xico was first used by a seeker of gold mines named Francisco de Ibarra who explored far to the north of Mexico in 1563 and reported his findings as being in  a New Mexico   19 Juan de O ate officially established the name when he was appointed the first governor of the new Province of New Mexico in 1598  18  36 37 The same year he founded the San Juan de los Caballeros colony  the first permanent European settlement in the future state of New Mexico  20  on the Rio Grande near Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo  18  37 O ate extended El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro   Royal Road of the Interior   by 700 miles  1 100 km  from Santa B rbara  Chihuahua to his remote colony  21  49 The settlement of Santa Fe was established at the foot of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains  the southernmost subrange of the Rocky Mountains  around 1608  21  182 The city  along with most of the settled areas of the state  was abandoned by the Spanish for 12 years  1680 1692  as a result of the successful Pueblo Revolt  22  After the death of the Pueblo leader Pop   Diego de Vargas restored the area to Spanish rule  18  68 75 While developing Santa Fe as a trade center  the returning settlers founded Albuquerque in 1706 from existing surrounding communities  18  84 naming it for the viceroy of New Spain  Francisco Fern ndez de la Cueva  10th Duke of Alburquerque  23  As a part of New Spain  the claims for the province of New Mexico passed to independent Mexico in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence  18  109 The Republic of Texas claimed the portion east of the Rio Grande when it seceded from Mexico in 1836  24  Texas was separated from New Mexico by the Comancheria and its only attempt to establish a presence or control in the claimed territory was the failed Texas Santa Fe Expedition  The extreme northeastern part of New Mexico was originally ruled by France  and sold to the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803  25  By 1800 the Spanish population had reached 25 000  but Apache and Comanche raids on Hispanic settlers were common until well into the period of U S  occupation  26  Following the Mexican American War  from 1846 1848 and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848  Mexico ceded its mostly unsettled northern holdings  today known as the American Southwest and California  to the United States of America  18  132 In the Compromise of 1850 Texas ceded its claims to the area lying east of the Rio Grande in exchange for ten million dollars 18  135 and the US government established the New Mexico Territory on September 9  1850  including most of the present day states of Arizona and New Mexico  and part of Colorado  citation needed  The United States acquired the southwestern boot heel of the state and

the Trans Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War  Both Confederate and Union governments claimed ownership and territorial rights over New Mexico Territory  In 1861 the Confederacy claimed the southern tract as its own Arizona Territory and waged the ambitious New Mexico Campaign in an attempt to control the American Southwest and open up access to Union California  Confederate power in the New Mexico Territory was effectively broken after the Battle of Glorieta Pass in 1862  However  the Confederate territorial government continued to operate out of Texas  and Confederate troops marched under the Arizona flag until the end of the war  Additionally  over 8 000 troops from New Mexico Territory served the Union  27  Congress admitted New Mexico as the 47th state in the Union on January

legislature until 1935  all state officials are required to have a good knowledge of English  Cobarrubias and Fishman therefore argue that New Mexico cannot be considered a bilingual state as not all laws are published in both languages  47  Others  such as Juan Perea  claim that the state was officially bilingual until 1953  49  In either case  Hawaii is the only state that remains officially bilingual in the 21st century  50  With regards to the judiciary  witnesses have the right to testify in either of the two languages  and monolingual speakers of Spanish have the same right to be

Columbian trade with Mesoamerican cultures included northbound exotic birds  seashells and copper  Turquoise  pottery  and salt were some of the goods transported south along the Rio Grande  Present day New Mexico s pre Columbian trade is especially remarkable for being undertaken on foot  The north south trade route later became a path for colonists with horses arriving from New Spain as well as trade and communication  The route was called El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro  78  The Santa Fe Trail was the 19th century US territory s vital commercial and military highway link to the Eastern United States  79  All with termini in Northern New Mexico  the Camino Real  the Santa Fe Trail and the Old Spanish Trail are all recognized as National Historic Trails  New Mexico s latitude and low passes made it an attractive east west transportation corridor  80  As a territory  the Gadsden Purchase increased New Mexico s land area for the purpose of the construction of a southern transcontinental railroad  that of the Southern Pacific Railroad  Another transcontinental railroad was completed by the Atchison  Topeka and Santa Fe Railway  The railroads essentially replaced the earlier trails but brought on a population boom  Early transcontinental auto trails later crossed the state bringing more migrants  Railroads were later supplemented or replaced by a system of
