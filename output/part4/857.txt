 Adolescence  from Latin  adolescere meaning  to grow up   1  is a transitional stage of physical sex and mental human development generally occurring between puberty and legal adulthood  age of majority   1  2  but largely characterized as beginning and ending with the teenage stage  2  3  4  According to Erik Erikson s stages of human development  for example  a young adult is generally a person between the ages of 20 and 40  whereas an adolescent is a person between the ages of 13 and 19  3  4  Adolescence can also be defined more simply  as the threshold from childhood to adulthood  5  Scholars have found it difficult to agree upon a precise definition of adolescence  because it can be approached from various angles  A thorough understanding of adolescence in today s society depends on information from various perspectives  most importantly from the areas of psychology  biology  history  sociology  education  and anthropology  Within all of these perspectives  it can be generalized that adolescence is viewed as a transitional period whose chief purpose is the preparation of children for adult roles  6  Historically  puberty has been heavily associated with teenagers and the onset of adolescent development  7  8  9  However  the start of puberty has had somewhat of an increase in preadolescence  particularly females  as seen with early and precocious puberty   and adolescence has had an occasional extension beyond the teenage years  typically males  compared to previous generations  These changes have made it more difficult to rigidly define the time frame in which adolescence occurs  10  11  12  13  The end of adolescence and the beginning of adulthood varies by country and by function  and furthermore even within a single nation state or culture there can be different ages at which an individual is considered to be  chronologically and legally  mature enough to be entrusted by society with certain tasks  Such milestones include  but are not limited to  driving a vehicle  having legal sexual relations  serving in the armed forces or on a jury  purchasing and drinking alcohol  voting  entering into contracts  completing certain levels of education  and marrying  Adolescence is usually accompanied by an increased independence allowed by the parents or legal guardians and less supervision  contrary to the preadolescence stage  In studying adolescent development  14  adolescence can be defined biologically  as the physical transition marked by the onset of puberty and the termination of physical growth  cognitively  as changes in the ability to think abstractly and multi dimensionally  or socially  as a period of preparation for adult roles  Major pubertal and biological changes include changes to the sex organs  height  weight  and muscle mass  as well as major changes in brain structure and organization  Cognitive advances encompass both increases in knowledge and in the ability to think abstractly and to reason more effectively  The study of adolescent development often involves interdisciplinary collaborations  For example  researchers in neuroscience or bio behavioral health might focus on pubertal changes in brain structure and its effects on cognition or social relations  Sociologists interested in adolescence might focus on the acquisition of social roles  e g   worker or romantic partner  and how this varies across cultures or social conditions  15 Developmental psychologists might focus on changes in relations with parents and peers as a function of school structure and pubertal status  16

developmental period has varied considerably from one historical era to another  Because of its ever changing nature  it is impossible to generalize about issues such as the degree to which adolescence is stressful  the developmental tasks of the period  or the nature of intergenerational relationships  One group of theorists  called inventionists  argue that adolescence is entirely a social invention  and that the way in which we divide the life cycle into stages is nothing more than a reflection of the political  economic and social circumstances in which we live  According to this group  although puberty has been a feature of development for as long as humans have lived  it was not until the rise of obligatory education that we began treating adolescents as a distinct group  17   edit  Biological development  edit  Puberty  edit  General Main article  Puberty Upper body of teenage boy  The structure has changed to resemble an adult form  Puberty is a period of several years in which rapid physical growth and psychological changes occur  culminating in sexual maturity  The average onset of puberty is at 10 or 11 for girls and age 12 or 13 for boys  18  19  Every person s individual timetable for puberty is influenced primarily by heredity  although environmental factors  such as diet and exercise  also exert some influence  18  20  21  These factors can also contribute to precocious and delayed puberty  13  21  Some of the most significant parts of pubertal development involve distinctive physiological changes in individuals  height  weight  body composition  and circulatory and respiratory systems  22  These changes are largely influenced by hormonal activity  Hormones play an organizational role  priming the body to behave in a certain way once puberty begins  23  and an activational role  referring to changes in hormones during adolescence that trigger behavioral and physical changes  24  Puberty begins with a surge in hormone production  which in turn causes a number of physical changes  18  It is also the stage of life in which a child develops secondary sex characteristics  for example  a deeper voice and larger adam s apple in boys  and development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls  as his or her hormonal balance shifts strongly towards an adult state  This is triggered by the pituitary gland  which secretes a surge of hormonal agents into the blood stream  initiating a chain reaction  The male and female gonads are subsequently activated  which puts them into a state of rapid growth and development  the triggered gonads now commence the mass production of the necessary chemicals  The testes primarily release testosterone  and the ovaries predominantly dispense estrogen  The production of these hormones increases gradually until sexual maturation is met  Some boys may develop gynecomastia due to an imbalance of sex hormones  tissue responsiveness or obesity  25  26  Facial hair in males normally appears in a specific order during puberty  The first facial hair to appear tends to grow at the corners of the upper lip  typically between 14 to 16 years of age  27  28  It then spreads to form a moustache over the entire upper lip  This is followed by the appearance of hair on the upper part of the cheeks  and the area under the lower lip  27  The hair eventually spreads to the sides and lower border of the chin  and the rest of the lower face to form a full beard  27  As with most human biological processes  this specific order may vary among some individuals  Facial hair is often present in late adolescence  around ages 17 and 18  but may not appear until significantly later  28  29  Some men do not develop full facial hair for 10 years after puberty  28  Facial hair will continue to get coarser  darker and thicker for another 2 4 years after puberty  28  The major landmark of puberty for males is the first ejaculation  which occurs  on average  at age 13  30  For females  it is menarche  the onset of menstruation  which occurs  on average  between ages 12 and 13  20  31  32  33  The age of menarche is influenced by heredity  but a girl s diet and lifestyle contribute as well  20  Regardless of genes  a girl must have certain proportion of body fat to attain menarche  20  Consequently  girls who have a high fat diet and who are not physically active begin menstruating earlier  on average  than girls whose diet contains less fat and whose activities involve fat reducing exercise  e g  ballet and gymnastics   20  21  Girls who experience malnutrition or are in societies in which children are expected to perform physical labor also begin menstruating at later ages  20  The timing of puberty can have important psychological and social consequences  Early maturing boys are usually taller and stronger than their friends  34  They have the advantage in capturing the attention of potential partners and in becoming hand picked for sports  Pubescent boys often tend to have a good body image  are more confident  secure  and more independent  35  Late maturing boys can be less confident because of poor body image when comparing themselves to already developed friends and peers  However  early puberty is not always positive for boys  early sexual maturation in boys can be accompanied by increased aggressiveness due to the surge of hormones that affect them  35  Because they appear older than their peers  pubescent boys may face increased social pressure to conform to adult norms  society may view them as more emotionally advanced  despite the fact that their cognitive and social development may lag behind their appearance  35  Studies have shown that early maturing boys are more likely to be sexually active and are more likely to participate in risky behaviors  36  For girls early maturation can sometimes lead to increased self consciousness  though a typical aspect in maturing females  37  Because of their bodies  developing in advance  pubescent girls can become more insecure  37  Consequently  girls that reach sexual maturation early are more likely than their peers to develop eating disorders  Nearly half of all American high school girls  diet is to lose weight  37  In addition  girls may have to deal with sexual advances from older boys before they are emotionally and mentally mature  38  In addition to having earlier sexual experiences and more unwanted pregnancies than late maturing girls  early maturing girls are more exposed to alcohol and drug abuse  39  Those who have had such experiences tend to perform less well in school than their  inexperienced  age peers  40  Girls have usually reached full physical development by ages 15 17  2  41  19  while boys usually complete puberty by ages 16 18  41  19  42  Any increase in height beyond the post pubertal age is uncommon  Girls attain reproductive maturity about 4 years after the first physical changes of puberty appear  2  In contrast  boys accelerate more slowly but continue to grow for about 6 years after the first visible pubertal changes  35  42  Approximate outline of development periods in child and teenager development  Adolescence is marked in red at top right   edit  Growth spurt The adolescent growth spurt is a rapid increase in individuals  height and weight during puberty resulting from the simultaneous release of growth hormones  thyroid hormones  and androgens  43  Males experience their growth spurt about two years later  on average  than females  During their peak height velocity  the time of most rapid growth   adolescents grow at a growth rate nearly identical to that of a toddler about 4 inches  10 3 cm  a year for males and 3 5 inches  9 cm  for females  44  In addition to changes in height  adolescents also experience a significant increase in weight  Marshall  1978   The weight gained during adolescence constitutes nearly half of one s adult body weight  44  Teenage and early adult males may continue to gain natural muscle growth even after puberty  35  The accelerated growth in different body parts happens at different times  but for all adolescents it has a fairly regular sequence  The first places to grow are the extremities the head  hands and feet followed by the arms and legs  then the torso and shoulders  45  This non uniform growth is one reason why an adolescent body may seem to be out of proportion  During puberty  bones become harder and more brittle  At the conclusion of puberty  the ends of the long bones close during the process called epiphysis  There are ethnic differences in these skeletal changes  bone density increases significantly more among African American than white adolescents  which might account for decreased likelihood of African American women developing osteoporosis and having fewer bone fractures  46  Another set of significant physical changes during puberty happen in bodily distribution of fat and muscle  This process is different for females and males  Before puberty  there are nearly no sex differences in fat and muscle distribution  during puberty  boys grow muscle much faster than girls  although both sexes experience rapid muscle development  In contrast  though both sexes experience an increase in body fat  the increase much more significant for girls  Frequently  the increase in fat for girls happens in their years just before puberty  The ratio between muscle and fat among post pubertal boys is around three to one  while for girls it is about five to four  This may help explain sex differences in athletic performance  47  Pubertal development also affects circulatory and respiratory systems as an adolescents  heart and lungs increase in both size and capacity  These changes lead to increased strength and tolerance for exercise  Sex differences are apparent as males tend to develop  larger hearts and lungs  higher systolic blood pressure  a lower resting heart rate  a greater capacity for carrying oxygen to the blood  a greater power for neutralizing the chemical products of muscular exercise  higher blood hemoglobin and more red blood cells   48  It is important to note that  despite some genetic sex differences  environmental factors play a large role in biological changes during adolescence  For example  girls tend to reduce their physical activity in preadolescence 49  50  and may receive inadequate nutrition from diets that often lack important nutrients  such as iron  51  These environmental influences in turn affect female physical development   edit  Reproduction related changes Primary sex characteristics are those directly related to the sex organs  In males  the first stages of puberty involve growth of the testes and scrotum  followed by growth of the penis  52  At the time that the penis develops  the seminal vesicles  the prostate  and the bilbo urethral glands also enlarge and develop  The first ejaculation of seminal fluid generally occurs about one year after the beginning of accelerated penis growth  although this is often determined culturally rather than biologically  since for many boys first ejaculation occurs as a result of masturbation  45  Boys are generally fertile before they have an adult appearance 43  In females  changes in the primary sex characteristics involve growth of the uterus  vagina  and other aspects of the reproductive system  Menarche  the beginning of menstruation  is a relatively late development which follows a long series of hormonal changes  53  Generally  a girl is not fully fertile until several years after menarche  as regular ovulation follows menarche by about two years  54  Unlike males  therefore  females usually appear physically mature before they are capable of becoming pregnant  Changes in secondary sex characteristics include every change that is not directly related to sexual reproduction  In males  these changes involve appearance of pubic  facial  and body hair  deepening of the voice  roughening of the skin around the upper arms and thighs  and increased development of the sweat glands  In females  secondary sex changes involve elevation of the breast  widening of the hips  development of pubic and underarm hair  widening of the areolae  and elevation of the nipples  55  The changes in secondary sex characteristics that take place during puberty are often referred to in terms of five Tanner stages  56  named after the British pediatrician who devised the categorization system   edit  Changes in the brain The human brain is not fully developed by the time a person reaches puberty  Between the ages of 10 and 25  the brain undergoes changes that have important implications for behavior  see Cognitive development below   The brain reaches 90  of its adult size by the time a person is six years of age  57  Thus  the brain does not grow in size much during adolescence  However  the creases in the brain continue to become more complex until the late teens  The biggest changes in the folds of the brain during this time occur in the parts of the cortex that process cognitive and emotional information  57  Over the course of adolescence  the amount of white matter in the brain increases linearly  while the amount of grey matter in the brain follows an inverted U pattern  Through a process called synaptic pruning  unnecessary neuronal connections in the brain are eliminated and the amount of grey matter is pared down  However  this does not mean that the brain loses functionality  rather  it becomes more efficient due to increased myelination  insulation of axons  and the reduction of unused pathways  58  The first areas of the brain to be pruned are those involving primary functions  such as motor and sensory areas  The areas of the brain involved in more complex processes lose matter later in development  These include the lateral and prefrontal cortices  among other regions  59  Some of the most developmentally significant changes in the brain occur in the prefrontal cortex  which is involved in decision making and cognitive control  as well as other higher cognitive functions  During adolescence  myelination and synaptic pruning in the prefrontal cortex increases  improving the efficiency of information processing  and neural connections between the prefrontal cortex and other regions of the brain are strengthened  60  This leads to better evaluation of risks and rewards  as well as improved control over impulses  Specifically  developments in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex are important for controlling impulses and planning ahead  while development in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is important for decision making  Changes in the orbitofrontal cortex are important for evaluating rewards and risks  Two neurotransmitters that play important roles in adolescent brain development are glutamate and dopamine  Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter  During the synaptic pruning that occurs during adolescence  most of the neural connections that are pruned contain receptors for glutamate or other excitatory neurotransmitters  61  Because of this  by early adulthood the synaptic balance in the brain is more inhibitory than excitatory  Dopamine is associated with pleasure and attuning to the environment during decision making  During adolescence  dopamine levels in the limbic system increase and input of dopamine to the prefrontal cortex increases  62  The balance of excitatory to inhibitory neurotransmitters and increased dopamine activity in adolescence may have implications for adolescent risk taking and vulnerability to boredom  see Cognitive development  below   Development in the limbic system plays an important role in determining rewards and punishments and processing emotional experience and social information  Changes in the levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin in the limbic system make adolescents more emotional and more responsive to rewards and stress  The corresponding increase in emotional variability also can increase adolescents  vulnerability   edit  Cognitive development Adolescence is also a time for rapid cognitive development  63 Piaget describes adolescence as the stage of life in which the individual s thoughts start taking more of an abstract form and the egocentric thoughts decrease  This allows the individual to think and reason in a wider perspective  64  A combination of behavioural and fMRI studies have demonstrated development of executive functions  that is  cognitive skills that enable the control and coordination of thoughts and behaviour  which are generally associated with the prefrontal cortex  65  The thoughts  ideas and concepts developed at this period of life greatly influence one s future life  playing a major role in character and personality formation  66  Biological changes in brain structure and connectivity within the brain interact with increased experience  knowledge  and changing social demands to produce rapid cognitive growth  see Changes in the brain above   The age at which particular changes take place will vary between individuals  but the changes discussed below generally begin at puberty or shortly thereafter and some skills continue to develop as the adolescent ages   edit  Theoretical perspectives There are two perspectives on adolescent thinking  One is the constructivist view of cognitive development  Based on the work of Piaget  it takes a quantitative  state theory approach  hypothesizing that adolescents  cognitive improvement is relatively sudden and drastic  The second is the information processing perspective  which derives from the study of artificial intelligence and attempts to explain cognitive development in terms of the growth of specific components of the thinking process   edit  Improvements in cognitive ability By the time individuals have reached age 15 or so  their basic thinking abilities are comparable to those of adults  These improvements occur in five areas during adolescence  Attention  Improvements are seen in selective attention  the process by which one focuses on one stimulus while tuning out another  Divided attention  the ability to pay attention to two or more stimuli at the same time  also improves  67  68  Memory  Improvements are seen in both working memory and long term memory  69  Processing speed  Adolescents think more quickly than children  Processing speed improves sharply between age five and middle adolescence  it then begins to level off at age 15 and does not appear to change between late adolescence and adulthood  70  Organization  Adolescents are more aware of their own thought processes and can use mnemonic devices and other strategies to think more efficiently  71  Metacognition   edit  Hypothetical and abstract thinking Adolescents  thinking is less bound to concrete events than that of children  they can contemplate possibilities outside the realm of what currently exists  One manifestation of the adolescent s increased facility with thinking about possibilities is the improvement of skill in deductive reasoning  which leads to the development of hypothetical thinking  This provides the ability to plan ahead  see the future consequences of an action and to provide alternative explanations of events  It also makes adolescents more skilled debaters  as they can reason against a friend s or parent s assumptions  Adolescents also develop a more sophisticated understanding of probability  The appearance of more systematic  abstract thinking is another notable aspect of cognitive development during adolescence  For example  adolescents find it easier than children to comprehend the sorts of higher order abstract logic inherent in puns  proverbs  metaphors  and analogies  Their increased facility permits them to appreciate the ways in which language can be used to convey multiple messages  such as satire  metaphor  and sarcasm   Children younger than age nine often cannot comprehend sarcasm at all   72  This also permits the application of advanced reasoning and logical processes to social and ideological matters such as interpersonal relationships  politics  philosophy  religion  morality  friendship  faith  democracy  fairness  and honesty   edit  Metacognition A third gain in cognitive ability involves thinking about thinking itself  a process referred to as metacognition  It often involves monitoring one s own cognitive activity during the thinking process  Adolescents  improvements in knowledge of their own thinking patterns lead to better self control and more effective studying  It is also relevant in social cognition  resulting in increased introspection  self consciousness  and intellectualization  in the sense of thought about one s own thoughts  rather than the Freudian definition as a defense mechanism   Adolescents are much better able than children to understand that people do not have complete control over their mental activity  Being able to introspect may lead to two forms of adolescent egocentrism  which results in two distinct problems in thinking  the imaginary audience and the personal fable  These likely peak at age fifteen  along with self consciousness in general  73  Related to metacognition and abstract thought  perspective taking involves a more sophisticated theory of mind  74  Adolescents reach a stage of social perspective taking in which they can understand how the thoughts or actions of one person can influence those of another person  even if they personally are not involved  75   edit  Relativistic thinking Compared to children  adolescents are more likely to question others  assertions  and less likely to accept facts as absolute truths  Through experience outside the family circle  they learn that rules they were taught as absolute are in fact relativistic  They begin to differentiate between rules instituted out of common sense not touching a hot stove and those that are based on culturally relative standards  codes of etiquette  not dating until a certain age   a delineation that younger children do not make  This can lead to a period of questioning authority in all domains  76   edit  Wisdom Wisdom  or the capacity for insight and judgment that is developed through experience  77  increases between the ages of fourteen and twenty five  then levels off  Thus  it is during the adolescence adulthood transition that individuals acquire the type of wisdom that is associated with age  Wisdom is not the same as intelligence  adolescents do not improve substantially on IQ tests since their scores are relative to others in their same age group  and relative standing usually does not change everyone matures at approximately the same rate   edit  Risk taking In light of the fact that most injuries sustained by adolescents are related to risky behavior  car crashes  alcohol  unprotected sex   much research has been done on adolescent risk taking  particularly on whether and why adolescents are more likely to take risks than adults  Behavioral decision making theory says that adolescents and adults both weigh the potential rewards and consequences of an action  However  research has shown that adolescents seem to give more weight to rewards  particularly social rewards  than do adults  78  During adolescence  there is an extremely high emphasis on approval of peers as a reward due to adolescents  increased self consciousness  There may be evolutionary benefits to an increased propensity for risk taking in adolescence without risk taking  teenagers would not have the motivation or confidence necessary to make the change in society from childhood to adulthood  It may also have reproductive advantages  adolescents have a newfound priority in sexual attraction and dating  and risk taking is required to impress potential mates  Research also indicates that baseline sensation seeking may affect risk taking behavior throughout the lifespan  79  80   edit  Social development  edit  Identity development Among the most common beliefs about adolescence is that it is the time when teens form their personal identities  Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development  rather than formation  but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one s thoughts about the self  81  Researchers have used three general approaches to understanding identity development  self concept  sense of identity  and self esteem   edit  Self concept See also  Self concept Early in adolescence  cognitive developments result in greater self awareness  greater awareness of others and their thoughts and judgments  the ability to think about abstract  future possibilities  and the ability to consider multiple possibilities at once  As a result  adolescents experience a significant shift from the simple  concrete  and global self descriptions typical of young children  as children  they defined themselves with physical traits whereas as adolescents  they define themselves based on their values  thoughts and opinions   82  Adolescents can now conceptualize multiple  possible selves  they could become 83  and long term possibilities and consequences of their choices  84  Exploring these possibilities may result in abrupt changes in self presentation as the adolescent chooses or rejects qualities and behaviors  trying to guide the actual self toward the ideal self  who the adolescent wishes to be  and away from the feared self  who the adolescent does not want to be   For many  these distinctions are uncomfortable  but they also appear to motivate achievement through behavior consistent with the ideal and distinct from the feared possible selves  85  86  Further distinctions in self concept  called  differentiation   occur as the adolescent recognizes the contextual influences on their own behavior and the perceptions of others  and begin to qualify their traits when asked to describe themselves  87  Differentiation appears to be fully developed by mid adolescence  88  Peaking in the 7th 9th grades  the personality traits adolescents use to describe themselves refer to specific contexts  and therefore may contradict one another  The recognition of inconsistent content in the self concept is a common source of distress in these years  see Cognitive dissonance   89  but this distress may benefit adolescents by encouraging structural development  Differentiation results in organization and integration of the self concept  90  91  The multifaceted self is understood to include several stable  if inconsistent  sets of traits applicable when the individual with different people and circumstances  This includes negative traits and weaknesses  which adolescents can now recognize and qualify   consistent with this  adolescents who have more complex self conceptions are less likely to be depressed   92  93  Moreover  although only true in some circumstances  differentiated traits are contrasted with  false self behavior   which is not representative of the  real  self  94  Recognition of the inauthentic indicates that the adolescent is gaining a sense of continuous  overlapping  coherent sense of identity   edit  Sense of identity Unlike the conflicting aspects of self concept  identity represents a coherent sense of self stable across circumstances and including past experiences and future goals  Everyone has a self concept  whereas Erik Erikson argued that not everyone fully achieves identity  Erikson s theory of stages of development includes the identity crisis in which adolescents must explore different possibilities and integrate different parts of themselves before committing to their beliefs  He described the resolution of this process as a stage of  identity achievement   see Fig  1  but also stressed that the identity challenge  is never fully resolved once and for all at one point in time   95  Adolescents begin by defining themselves based on their crowd membership  Researcher James Marcia developed the current method for testing an individual s progress along these stages  96  97  His questions are divided into three categories  occupation  ideology  and interpersonal relationships  Answers are scored based on extent to which the individual has explored and the degree to which he has made commitments  The result is classification of the individual into a  Identity Diffusion in which all children begin  b  Identity Foreclosure in which commitments are made without the exploration of alternatives  c  Moratorium  or the process of exploration  or d  Identity Achievement in which Moratorium has occurred and resulted in commitments  98  Research since reveals self examination beginning early in adolescence  but identity achievement rarely occurring before age 18  99  The freshman year of college influences identity development significantly  but may actually prolong psychosocial moratorium by encouraging reexamination of previous commitments and further exploration of alternate possibilities without encouraging resolution  100  For the most part  evidence has supported Erikson s stages  each correlates with the personality traits he originally predicted  98  Studies also confirm the impermanence of the stages 101  there is no final endpoint in Identity Development   edit  Self esteem The final major aspect of identity formation is self esteem  one s thoughts and feelings about one s self concept and identity  Contrary to popular belief  there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop in self esteem over the course of adolescence  102   Barometric self esteem  fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety  but baseline self esteem remains highly stable across adolescence  103  The validity of global self esteem scales has been questioned  and many suggest that more specific scales might reveal more about the adolescent experience  104  It is also important to note that the patterns of change in self esteem differ significantly by gender   edit  Relationships  edit  Family See also  Sibling relationship Adolescence marks a rapid change in one s role within a family  Young children tend to assert themselves forcefully  but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence  105  when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals  When children go through puberty  there is often a significant increase in parent child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond  Arguments often concern minor issues of control  such as curfew  acceptable clothing  and the adolescent s right to privacy  106  107  which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority  108  Parent adolescent disagreement also increases as friends demonstrate a greater impact on one another  new influences on the adolescent that may be in opposition to parents  values  Although conflicts betweenn children and parents increase during adolescent  these are just relatively minor issues  Regarding to the important issues in lives  most adolescent still share the same attitudes and values as their parents  109  During childhood  siblings are a source of conflict and frustration as well as a support system  110  Adolescence may affect this relationship differently  depending on sibling gender  In same sex sibling pairs  intimacy peaks during early adolescence  then steadily declines  Mixed sex siblings pairs act in the opposite way  siblings drift apart during early adolescent years  but experience an increase in intimacy starting at middle adolescence  111  Sustaining positive sibling relations can assist adolescents in a number of ways  Siblings are able to act as peers  and may increase one another s sociability and feelings of self worth  Older siblings can give guidance to younger siblings  although the impact of this can be either positive or negative depending on the activity of the older sibling  Despite changing family roles during adolescence  the home environment and parents are still important for the behaviors and choices of adolescents  112  Adolescents who have a good relationship with their parents are less likely to engage in various risk behaviors  such as smoking  drinking  fighting  and or unprotected sexual intercourse  112   edit  Peers Peer groups are especially important during adolescence  a period of development characterized by a dramatic increase in time spent with peers 113  and a decrease in adult supervision  114  Adolescents also associate with friends of the opposite sex much more than in childhood 115  and tend to identify with larger groups of peers based on shared characteristics  116  Peer groups offer members the opportunity to develop various social skills  such as empathy  sharing and leadership  Peer groups can have positive influences on an individual  for instance on academic motivation and performance  but they can also have negative influences and lead to an increase in experimentation with drugs  drinking  vandalism  and stealing  117  Susceptibility to peer pressure increases during early adolescence  peaks around age 14  and declines thereafter  118  During early adolescence  adolescents often associate in cliques  exclusive  single sex groups of peers with whom they are particularly close  Towards late adolescence  cliques often merge into mixed sex groups as teenagers begin romantically engaging with one another  119  Typically  in schools  the most popular boys would participate in achievement oriented activities  which were highly competitive and aggressive such as  athletics  Likewise  the most popular girls would participate in the most interesting social activities  ranging from skiing to late night parties  Of course  girls who engaged in these activities had to be physically attractive to compete for the opposite sex s attention  Thus  it became common to attribute competitiveness to boys and attractiveness with girls in clique groups  120  These small friend groups break down even further as socialization becomes more couple oriented  Despite the common notion that cliques are an inherently negative influence  they may help adolescents become socially acclimated and form a stronger sense of identity  On a larger scale  adolescents often associate with crowds  groups of individuals who share a common interest or activity  Often  crowd identities may be the basis for stereotyping young people  categorizing them as jocks  nerds  and so on  In large  multi ethnic high schools  there are often ethnically determined crowds as well  121  While crowds are very influential during early and middle adolescence  they lose salience during high school as students identify more individually  122  While peers may facilitate social development for one another  they may also hinder it  Both physical and relational aggression are linked to a vast number of enduring psychological difficulties  especially depression  as is social rejection  123  Because of this  bullied adolescents often develop problems that lead to further victimization  124   edit  Romance and sexual activity Main article  Adolescent sexuality See also  Adolescent sexuality in the United States Romantic relationships tend to increase in prevalence throughout adolescence  By age 15  53  of adolescents have had a romantic relationship that lasted at least one month over the course of the previous 18 months  125  In a 2008 study conducted by YouGov for Channel 4  20  of 14 17 year olds surveyed revealed that they had their first sexual experience at 13 or under in the United Kingdom  126  A 2002 American study found that those aged 15 44 reported that the average age of first sexual intercourse was 17 0 for males and 17 3 for females  127  The typical duration of relationships increases throughout the teenage years as well  This constant increase in the likelihood of a long term relationship can be explained by sexual maturation and the development of cognitive skills necessary to maintain a romantic bond  e g  caregiving  appropriate attachment   although these skills are not strongly developed until late adolescence  128  Long term relationships allow adolescents to gain the skills necessary for high quality relationships later in life 129  and develop feelings of self worth  Overall  positive romantic relationships among adolescents can result in long term benefits  High quality romantic relationships are associated with higher commitment in early adulthood 130  and are positively associated with self esteem  self confidence  and social competence  131  132  Teenage couples at a fair in the American West  The age of consent to sexual activity varies widely among international jurisdictions  ranging from 12 to 21 years  133  Adolescents often date within their demographic in regards to race  ethnicity  popularity  and physical attractiveness  134  However  there are traits in which certain individuals  particularly adolescent girls  seek diversity  While most adolescents date people approximately their own age  boys typically date partners the same age or younger  girls typically date partners the same age or older  125  Dating violence is fairly prevalent within adolescent relationships  When surveyed  10 45  of adolescents reported having experiencing physical violence in the context of a relationship while one third to a quarter of adolescents reported having experiencing psychological aggression  This reported aggression includes hitting  throwing things  or slaps  although most of this physical aggression does not result in a medical visit  Physical aggression in relationships tends to decline from high school through college and young adulthood  By their early twenties  many fewer romantic couple engage in physical aggression  and aggressors tend to be much more deviant  135  In heterosexual couples  there is no significant difference between the rates of male and female aggressors  a surprising finding considering the common assumption that males are more aggressive overall  136  137  138  Despite these jarring statistics  nurturant parenting style is associated with lower rates of relationship violence  139  Adolescence marks a time of sexual maturation  which manifests in social interactions as well  While adolescents may engage in casual sexual encounters  often referred to as hookups   most sexual experience during this period of development takes place within romantic relationships  140  Kissing  hand holding  and hugging signify satisfaction and commitment  Among young adolescents   heavy  sexual activity  marked by genital stimulation  is often associated with violence  depression  and poor relationship quality  141  142  This effect does not hold true for sexual activity in late adolescence that takes place within a romantic relationship  143  Adolescent sexuality refers to sexual feelings  behavior and development in adolescents and is a stage of human sexuality  Sexuality and sexual desire usually begins to intensify along with the onset of puberty  The expression of sexual desire among adolescents  or anyone  for that matter   might be influenced by family values and the culture and religion they have grown up in  or as a backlash to such   social engineering  social control  taboos  and other kinds of social mores  In contemporary society  adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform  Whilst some of these such as emotional distress  fear of abuse or exploitation  and sexually transmitted diseases  including HIV AIDS  are not necessarily inherent to adolescence  others such as pregnancy  through non use or failure of contraceptives  are seen as social problems in most western societies  In terms of sexual identity  while all sexual orientations found in adults are also represented among adolescents  statistically the suicide rate amongst LGBT adolescents is up to four times higher than that of their heterosexual peers  144  According to anthropologist Margaret Mead and psychologist Albert Bandura  citation needed  the turmoil found in adolescence in Western society has a cultural rather than a physical cause  they reported that societies where young women engaged in free sexual activity had no such adolescent turmoil   edit  Culture In commerce  this generation  21st century adolescence  is seen as an important target  Mobile phones  electronic devices  contemporary popular music  movies  television programs  websites  sports  video games and clothes are heavily marketed and often popular amongst adolescents  There are also many different ways of viewing adolescence that are prevalent in the world today   edit  Sexuality There are many cultural and socio economic differences which influence how adolescents  sexuality develops  Menarche  the first menstrual period of a female bodied person s life  is  for many cultures  the defining point for the beginning of a transition into adulthood  The age of menarche varies from culture to culture  Girls from countries where menarche menstruation is seen as an important event  or where there is an ambivalence towards it  tend to have more negative opinions about it  145  146  An adolescent s sexual socialization is highly dependent upon the society they live in  and how restrictive or permissive that society is when it comes to sexual activity  Restrictive societies  pressure youngsters to refrain from sexual activity until they either have undergone a formal rite of passage or have married   147  Therefore the sexual transition of adolescence is highly discontinuous because there is little preparation for an adult sexuality  147  These cultures either control adolescence by separating the males and females throughout their development  or they restrict sexual activity through public shaming and physical punishment  148  In semi restrictive societies  adults do not condone sexual activity however often do not take strong steps towards restricting it   Premarital promiscuity is common  and the parents do not object as long as the love affairs are kept secret   148  While some media portrays the United States as a permissive society  adults frequently try to discourage sexual activity among adolescence  This is most obvious among adolescence women because it is premarital pregnancy  rather than premarital sex that is highly objectionable in the United States  149  It is also common for adults to lecture women about sex and the importance of virginity by telling them that females do not need sex as much as males do  150  Despite these attempts to reduce sexual promiscuity  parents in the United States and other semi restrictive societies do not prohibit young men and women from interacting both in social and private settings  In permissive societies  the transition into sexual adulthood is highly continuous and begins at an early age  149  Some examples of sexually permissive societies are the Pukapukans of Polynesia and Trobiand girls and boys  149  In the Pukapukans society  parent simply ignore any sexual activity among children even when they are masturbating freely and openly in public  In the Trobiand society  young girls and boys participate in oral stimulation as a means of amusement and are encourage to participate in sexual activity with other young girls and boys at any time  they are encouraged to go into any hut or hide behind any bush  148   edit  Autonomy Another way to define the development of adolescents is their strive for autonomy  According to McElhaney et al   there are three ways in which autonomy can be described  The first being emotional autonomy which is stated as being the development of more adult like close relationship with adults and peers  The second form of autonomy is behavioral autonomy  which is the ability to be able to make independent decisions and follow through with them  The third is known as cognitive autonomy and is characterized as the manifestation of an independent set of beliefs  values and opinions  151  Most of the cultural differences however tend to be visible in behavioral autonomy as this is based on when adolescence are allowed to go on dates  or go out with friends  One way in which the cultural differences in behavioral autonomy is by comparing the  teen timetables  of parents and adolescents of different cultures  The  teen timetable  is  a questionnaire that asks at what age adolescents should be permitted to engage in various behaviors that signal autonomy   152  When comparing the timetables of White and Asian families across the world  it can be concluded that in general  White parents and adolescents tend to expect autonomy earlier than their Asian counterparts  disregarding whether the families lived in America  Australia  or Hong Kong  It is also the case that an adolescents mental health is best when their feelings of autonomy match closely with their parents  153  It is for this reason  recent emigrants  that move from a culture that normally grants autonomy at a later age to a culture with a younger age at which autonomy is granted  often experience family stress  Since adolescence generally become accustomed to the novel culture quicker than adults  the learn to expect autonomy earlier than their parents  154   edit  Time use American teenagers spend more time on leisure than many other countries  The average American adolescent spends about five hours a week on homework  while Indian  Taiwanese  and Japanese students spend an average of five hours a day  This is most likely due to the amount of emphasis and pressure that is placed on adolescents  education in those countries  Americans tend to spend more time playing sports  socializing  caring for their appearance  and working after school jobs  155  Differences in how American teens use their leisure time tend to be influenced by their amount of involvement in various activities rather than ethnicity or socioeconomic background  Busier  more well rounded teens tend to be better adjusted and more goal oriented than their peers who engage in only one activity  such as sports  or none  156   edit  Work In many developing countries  it is common for adolescents to drop out of high school and start working  These adolescents generally receive full time positions by the age of 15 16 and they often stay in the same jobs for the remainder of their lifetime  157  It is the case though that the rate of adolescents in the workforce today is decreasing  One example of this is China  where as the accessibility of education has increased  the amount of adolescents in the workforce has dropped drastically  Half of all 16 year olds were employed in 1980 however in 1990  only fewer than one quarter were in workforce  158  When comparing more industrialized countries  American adolescents are far more likely to hold jobs than both Asian and European countries  Two thirds of American high school juniors hold jobs during the school year where as only one quarter of Taiwanese and Japanese juniors do  155  In many European countries such as France  Hungary and Switzerland adolescents do not work at all and if they do hold jobs  then they are informal  only last for a few hours a week  and more most commonly jobs such as babysitting  159   edit  Legal issues  rights and privileges This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   February 2011  Internationally  those who reach a certain age  often 18  though this varies  are legally considered to have reached the age of majority and are regarded as adults and are held to be responsible for their actions  People below this age are considered minors or children  A person below the age of majority may gain adult rights through legal emancipation  Despite the legal adult age of 18  many specific rights such as consumption  voting  consent  and working have different ages around the world  A sign outside a sex shop reads  Must Be 18 To Enter  in Chapel Hill  North Carolina  The legal working age in Western countries is usually 14 to 16  depending on the number of hours and type of employment  In the United Kingdom and Canada  for example  young people between 14 and 16 can work at certain types of light work with some restrictions to allow for schooling  while youths over 16 can work full time  excluding night work   Many countries also specify a minimum school leaving age  ranging from 10 to 18  at which a person is legally allowed to leave compulsory education  In most democratic countries  a citizen is eligible to vote at 18  For example  in the United States  the Twenty sixth amendment decreased the voting age from 21 to 18  In a minority of countries  the voting age is 17  for example  Indonesia  or 16  for example  Brazil   By contrast  some countries have a minimum voting age of 21  for example  Singapore  whereas the minimum age in Uzbekistan is 25  Age of candidacy is the minimum age at which a person can legally qualify to hold certain elected government offices  In most countries  a person must be 18 or over to stand for elected office  but some countries such as the United States and Italy have further restrictions depending on the type of office  The sale of selected items such as cigarettes  alcohol  and videos with violent or pornographic content is also restricted by age in most countries  In the U S  the minimum age to buy an R rated movie  M rated game or an album with a parental advisory label is 17  in some states  the age is 18 or even 21   In the United States  teenagers are allowed to drive between 14 18  each state sets its own minimum driving age of which a curfew may be imposed   in the US  adolescents 17 years of age can serve in the military  In Europe it is more common for the driving age to be higher  usually 18  while the drinking age is lower than that of the US  usually 16 or 18   In Canada  the drinking age is 18 in some areas and 19 in other areas  In Australia  universally  the minimum drinking age is 18  unless a person is in a private residence or is under parental supervision in a licensed premises  The driving age varies from state to state but the more common system is a graduated system of  L plates   a learning license that requires supervision from a licensed driver  from age 16  red  P plates   probationary license  at 17  green  P plates  at 18 and finally a full license  i e  for most people around the age of 20  The legal gambling age also depends on the jurisdiction  although it is typically 18  The age of consent to sexual activity varies widely between jurisdictions  ranging from 13 to 21 years  the average age is 16  160  The age at which people are allowed to marry also varies  from 17 in Yemen to 22 for males and 20 for females in China  In Western countries  people are typically allowed to marry at 18  although they are sometimes allowed to marry at a younger age with parental or court consent  Since the advent of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989  children defined as under 18   almost every country  except the U S   amp  Somalia  in the world has become voluntarily legally committed to advancing an anti discriminatory stance towards young people of all ages  This is a legally binding document which secures youth participation throughout society while acting against unchecked child labor  child soldiers  child prostitution  and pornography   edit  Transitions into adulthood A broad way of defining adolescence is the transition from child to adulthood which happens to vary drastically in time between cultures  In some countries  such as the United States  adolescence can last nearly a decade  but in others  the transition often in the form of a ceremony can last for only a few days  161  In the U S   while there are no marked ceremonies  there are popular social and religious traditions that tend to mark this transition  such as Bar Mitzvahs  Quincea eras  cotillions  and d butante balls  In other countries  initiation ceremonies play an important role  marking the transition into adulthood or the entrance into adolescence  The transition is usually accompanied by obvious physical changes  which can vary from a change in clothing to tattoos and scarification  162   edit  Female specific rituals One example of a female bodied ritual is the first menstruation ritual in Sri Lanka  This ritual consists of isolating the female immediately after her first menstruation of the  killa   which is believed to be evil  and keeping her in isolation for the next three days  On the fourth day  a ritual bath is given by the mother or a washing woman   redi n nd     who is paid to take away the clothes soaked in  killa  and rid the house of  vas   the evil eye  163  Another example of a rite of passage are the Dipo rituals which are performed by the Krobo in Ghana  This rite of passage consists of two separate rituals  one private and one public  164  The private ritual lasts around threesacred stone  which determines their virginity and  thus  their suitability to perpetuate the proud tradition of Krobo womanhood   165  After this encounter  the women partake in a five day outdoor ceremony where they dance for the men of the tribe and potential husbands  165   edit  Male specific rituals One example of a male specific coming of age ritual can be seen amongst the Maasai people  They have many different ceremonies that are based about the learning of brotherhood and how to be a true warrior or husband but the most important ceremony is the  Emuratare   The  Emuratare  is the circumcision ceremony that is required for Maasai boys to become warriors  It is done when the boy is between the ages of 14 16  Before the ceremony  they are required to herd cattle for seven days in order to prove they are worthy of being called a warrior  On the eighth day  the weeks and its goal is to teach  the finer points of personal grooming  female conduct  domesticity  and  finally  the arts of dance and seduction  165   After their training  the man must pass a final test which consists of a  ritual encounter with Tekpete  the boy is publicly circumcised  During the process  he is not allowed to show any signs of pain  If he does  he will be considered weak  166   edit  Media  edit  Stereotypes The mass media greatly exaggerates adolescent problem behaviors  Media portrayals of drug use  sexual encounters  and psychological and behavioral disorders are rarely accurate  For example  though television often portrays scenarios such as these  a romantic breakup does not necessarily lead to heavy depression or suicide  and one drink at a party does not often end in a lifetime of addiction or a fatal car crash  Because people view these negative stereotypes about adolescents so often in the media  they are led to believe that adolescence is always a very problematic time of development  167  Adolescence is a period of development in which it is very normal to seek independence  explore personal identities  and pursue relationships  and thus it is expected that some of the experimentation that adolescents engage in is risky  168  It is extremely important to distinguish between occasional experimentation during adolescence and long term problem behaviors  For example  although many teenagers will commit an act that is against the law during their adolescent years  relatively few adolescents continue on to commit criminal acts in their later lives  167  Further  it is very important to distinguish between problems that first occur during adolescence and those that may have developed during childhood  The majority of adolescents who have continuous problems with the law during adolescence also had problems at an early age  even as early as preschool  169  Thus  even if a problem is displayed during adolescence  it may not be a problem related to adolescence  What s more  what the media neglects to mention is that most problems that adolescents experience are resolved by the time they reach adulthood  For example  delinquency  drug use  and eating disorders are all experienced more by the adolescent population than the adult population  The adolescents that take part in these behaviors often abandon them as they reach the beginning of adulthood  Oftentimes  the adults that do continue with these behaviors from adolescence often had problematic childhoods  which in turn led to problematic adolescent and adult years  Thus  though the media often proclaims that the problem behaviors of adolescents are causing the downfall of civilization  it is important to remember that most of these behaviors fade over time  167  Finally  delinquent or problem behaviors that occur during adolescence are hardly ever a direct result of adolescence  For example  media theories that blame problem behaviors  rebellions  and identity crises of adolescents on their hormones actually have no scientific support  In fact  hormonal changes during adolescence only have a very small impact on adolescent behavior  Thus  contrary to the suggestions of the popular media  when an adolescent experiences a very serious psychological problem  this behavior is usually not normative and is most likely a sign that something is not right  167   edit  Media profusion Because access to media has increased so quickly through a vast number of mediums such as computers  cell phones  stereos and televisions  adolescents  use of media has skyrocketed in the past decade  Almost all American households have at least one television  more than three quarters of all adolescents  homes have access to Internet  and more than 90  of American adolescents use the Internet at least occasionally  170  As a result of the amount of time adolescents spend using these devices  their total media exposure is extremely high   the average adolescent uses one of the mass media more than 6 hours a day  What s more  when multitasking with more than one media device is taken into account  every day  adolescents are exposed to media for between 8 and 9 hours  171  In the last decade  the amount of time that adolescents spend on the computer has greatly increased  172  Online activities with the highest rates of use among adolescents are video games  78  of adolescents   email  73    instant messaging  68    social networking sites  65    news sources  63    music  59    and videos  57    173  In fact  because adolescents spend so much time playing video games  some research has suggested that 10  of preadolescents and adolescents are  pathological   174  However  better academic performance has been associated with moderate Internet use  167   edit  Theories on media impact There is much debate over the impact that media has on adolescents  development and behavior  However  because adolescents choose which media they re exposed to  it is very difficult for researchers to distinguish cause and effect  175  For example  though one could argue that violent video games and films may spur aggression  it is just as likely that aggressive adolescents are more likely to choose to watch these violent images  176  177  There are three widely known theories regarding the impact of media on adolescent development and behavior  The first  referred to as the cultivation theory  argues that adolescents  beliefs are very much shaped by the media  An example of cultivation theory would be believing that if adolescents watch beer commercials during the Super Bowl  they would then be influenced to drink beer  178  The second theory  the uses and gratifications theory  suggests that adolescents choose which media they are exposed to  According to this theory  adolescents choose media that is consistent with their interests  and thus adolescents who drink beer are more likely to watch football and be exposed to and influenced by beer commercials  179  The last theory regarding media influence is the media practice model  This model revolves around the idea that adolescents  preferences and their media exposure are reciprocal  and that adolescents choose what media they re exposed to  as well as interpret the media in ways that influence how much impact it has on them  180   edit  Exposure to controversial media content Most research has focused on the impact of television on development  Because of this  little is known about the effects of other media on adolescent development  The topics most focused on by researchers are drugs  violence  and sex  though researchers disagree about the magnitude of the effects of adolescents  exposure to these concepts in the media  However  most scholars agree that adolescents are regularly exposed to controversial media content  181  Of the television shows popular among adolescents  more than 70  display sexual content and images  and there are approximately seven sexual scenes per hour of television  182  However  with the increases in reality television shows  sexual content has declined since 2000  Usually  sex portrayed in television shows and music videos is casual and untroubled  with humorous or suggestive undertones  183  184  In the past  some scholars have expressed concern that sexual messages in the media are unrealistic  particularly with regard to women  185  Furthermore  the media often portrays men as aggressive and dominant  while women are often portrayed as more submissive  176  Comparatively  there is a lack of messages regarding the consequences of sex  physically and mentally  182  Violent imagery is often depicted in film  music  and video games  commonly used by adolescents  176  Because more than 60  of television shows contain violence  adolescents view approximately 10 000 media violence acts every year  186  According to some research  adolescents who play relatively more violent video games are involved in more fights and get into more arguments than peers who play fewer such games  187  Furthermore  some studies suggest that violent lyrics to songs increase the aggressive thoughts of individuals who listen to them  188  However  it is highly debated whether these violent games or lyrics actually cause adolescents to commit acts of real life aggression  especially because violence among adolescents has declined in the past decade even though the sale of violent video games has increased  189  The most recent research suggests that there is little correlation between consuming violence in the media and actual aggressive acts among youth  190  In the mass media  alcohol  tobacco  and illicit drugs use are commonly depicted  During the 1990s these three substances were displayed in about 70  of television shows  many movies  and around 25  of music videos  Approximately 10  of all television commercials were for alcoholic beverages during that time  Also  advertisements for liquor and tobacco had been becoming ever present on the Internet  with their companies sponsoring websites and chat rooms  186  By contrast  however  more research by the Parents Television Council  suggests that prevalence of smoking on television is currently rare  191  Research has found that adolescents are more likely to smoke if their favorite film star is a smoker  176  Some research suggests that adolescents who are less likely to smoke are more likely to be affected by seeing smoking in movies  Because of this  anti smoking ads are now often on the DVDs of films that contain smoking  192  However  these findings are correlational  not causal  and other research has found that peers  not media  influence teen smoking  193  However  anti drinking and anti smoking ads have been shown to be effective in changing the beliefs and attitudes of adolescents about drinking and smoking  194   edit  Electronic media influence Because it is becoming increasingly easier to communicate via electronic communication  the way adolescents socialize has changed  The effects of adolescents  online socialization are very controversial and intriguing  Many are concerned over whether electronic communication versus in person communication negatively affects the development of adolescents  and there are also worries over whether strangers who intend to harm adolescents  like sexual predators  are easily able to contact and develop relationships with adolescents through publicly posted information on social websites  167   edit  Internet impact Many adolescents  parents worry that electronic communication may negatively affect their social development  replace face to face communication  negatively affect their social skills  lead to unsafe communication with strangers  and replace more valuable activities  167  Though research is inconclusive  it suggests that the effects of Internet use are very small  195  However  Internet may have a negative effect on the physical health of adolescents  as time spent using the Internet replaces time doing physical activities  For example  a typical 15 year old American adolescent spends approximately 6 hours a day sitting in front of screens  but less than 1 hour doing physical activity  176  196  However  the Internet can be extremely useful in educating teens about accurate health information  though the usefulness depends on the quality and content of the websites  material  Studies have found that it depends on what teens are doing online that determines whether high Internet use is harmful to their development  167  Research suggests that Internet communication brings friends closer and is beneficial for socially anxious teens  who find it easier to interact socially online  197  198  199  Alternatively  getting to know strangers online and developing friendships with them may lower the quality of relationships with one s friends  200  Though many parents worry about their adolescents becoming addicted to their computers  Internet use addiction rates among adolescents are extremely low  as is electronic bullying  or cyber bullying  though the popular media often suggests otherwise  195  201  202  Every year  approximately 13  of adolescents are sexually solicited online  and about 4  of the solicitations are also followed with solicitation for contact not through a computer medium  203  204  Most of the adolescents at risk for solicitation are females of high school age and boys who identify themselves as gay  167  Studies show that posting personal information on social networking sites such as MySpace or Facebook does not pose risks for sexual solicitation   instead  it is the way that adolescents interact with others online that places them at risk for unwanted sexual solicitation  205  Also  though parents often are concerned about adolescents viewing pornography on the Internet  most pornography that adolescents view is unwanted and unsought  In fact  most teens spend their time on the Internet visiting entertainment websites and websites that are most frequented by adults rather than visiting pornographic websites  204  The impact of Internet use on cognitive development has not been widely studied  However  there isn t any evidence that Internet use benefits or has any negative effects on the school performance of adolescents  167  What s more  there are a few studies that have shown that playing video games may improve reaction times  hand eye coordination  and improve visual skills  195  206   edit  Mass media effect on adolescent girl body image Because of concerns over body dissatisfaction among teenage girls  research has been conducted on the effects of the messages aimed toward adolescent females in the mass media  Most magazine advertisements emphasize the necessity of physical attractiveness and advocate thinness  167  Some research has shown that adolescent females who read fashion magazines on a regular basis are more dissatisfied with their bodies than their peers who do not read the magazines as often or at all  176  207  However  most meta analyses of this research find effect sizes for the relationship between media and body dissatisfaction to be small or negligible  208  209  Effect sizes from meta analysis generally range from correlational coefficient r    08 to r    17  and note inconsistencies between studies  Other research suggests that adolescent girls who read magazines featuring articles and advertisements about dieting and weight loss partake in more unhealthy behaviors for weight control  such as taking laxatives and vomiting to lose or maintain weight  210  However  other scholars have contested this view  noting that the research is inconsistent and effects are generally small and inconsistent across studies  211   edit  Consumption Adolescents are a very attractive target for many businesses because of their population size  their lack of savings habits  and the prevalence of their employment  212  An average adolescent spends nearly all of their approximately  400 in spending money per month  This money is often spent on leisure activities such as food  clothes  cosmetics  cars  and stereo equipment  213  Though some believe that advertising aimed at adolescents takes advantage of their impulsiveness and self consciousness  proponents of adolescent consumerism argue that it is not only advertising  but the strong influences that teens have on each other regarding their purchases that drives adolescent consumerism  167  This peer influence has become known as viral marketing  in which products are promoted by encouraging individuals to pass information on to others  214  215  The adolescent market also extends into the adult market  often because of teens  influences on their parents  purchases   with adult clothing and music often exhibiting the same trends as adolescents   only toned down  216   edit  See also Wikimedia Commons has
