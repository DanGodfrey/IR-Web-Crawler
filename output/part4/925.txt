Specific themes Economics Military Slavery Religious Social South Africa Portal v t e Apartheid was a system of racial segregation enforced through legislation by the National Party governments of South Africa between 1948 and 1994  under which the rights of the majority non white inhabitants of South Africa were curtailed and white supremacy and Afrikaner minority rule was maintained  Apartheid was developed after World War II by the Afrikaner dominated National Party and Broederbond organizations and was practiced also in South West Africa  which was administered by South Africa under a League of Nations mandate  revoked in 1966   until it gained independence as Namibia in 1990  Racial segregation in South Africa began in colonial times under Dutch and British rule  However  apartheid as an official policy was introduced following the general election of 1948  New legislation classified inhabitants into four racial groups   native    white    coloured   and  Asian    1  and residential areas were segregated  sometimes by means of forced removals  Non white political representation was completely abolished in 1970  and starting in that year black people were deprived of their citizenship  legally becoming citizens of one of ten tribally based self governing homelands called bantustans  four of which became nominally independent states  The government segregated education  medical care  beaches  and other public services  and provided black people with services inferior to those of white people  2  Apartheid sparked significant internal resistance and violence as well as a long arms and trade embargo against South Africa  3  Since the 1950s  a series of popular uprisings and protests were met with the banning of opposition and imprisoning of anti apartheid leaders  As unrest spread and became more violent  state organisations responded with increasing repression and state sponsored violence  Reforms to apartheid in the 1980s failed to quell the mounting opposition  and in 1990 President Frederik Willem de Klerk began negotiations to end apartheid  4  culminating in multi racial democratic elections in 1994  which were won by the African National Congress under Nelson Mandela  The vestiges of apartheid still shape South African politics and society  Contents 1 Precursors of apartheid 2 Institution of apartheid 2 1 The election of 1948

the new British colonial rulers were required to respect the previous legislation enacted under Roman Dutch law 6  and this led to a separation of the law in South Africa from English Common Law and a high degree of legislative autonomy  The governors and assemblies that governed the legal process in the various colonies of South Africa were then launched on a different and independent legislative path from the rest of the British Empire  In the days of slavery  slaves in general required passes to travel away from their masters  However  in 1797 the Landdrost and Heemraden of Swellendam and Graaff Reinett  the Dutch colonial governing authority  extended pass laws beyond slaves and ordained that all Hottentots moving about the country for any purpose should carry passes  7  This was confirmed by the British Colonial government in 1809 by the Hottentot Proclamation which decreed that if a Hottentot  and Khoikhoi  were to move they would need a pass from their master or a local official  7  Ordinance No  49 of 1828 decreed that prospective black immigrants were to be granted passes for the sole purpose of seeking work  7  The Hottentot Proclamation was repealed by Ordnance 50 in 1828 7  for Coloreds and Khoikhoi but not for other Africans and other Africans were still forced to carry passes  The Slavery Abolition Act 1833  3  amp  4 Will  IV c  73  was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom abolishing slavery throughout the British Empire and overrode the Cape Articles of Capitulation  To comply with the Slavery Abolition Act the South African legislation was expanded to include Ordinance 1 in 1835 which effectively changed the status of slaves to indentured labourers  This was followed by Ordinance 3 in 1848 which introduced an indenture system for Xhosa that was little different from slavery  The various South African colonies then passed legislation throughout the rest of the nineteenth century to limit the freedom of unskilled workers  to increase the restrictions on indentured workers and to regulate the relations between the races  The Franchise and Ballot Act of 1892 instituted limits based on financial means and education to the black franchise  8  and the Natal Legislative Assembly Bill of 1894 deprived Indians of the right to vote  9  In 1905 the General Pass Regulations Bill denied blacks the vote altogether  limited them to fixed areas and inaugurated the infamous Pass System  10  Then followed the Asiatic Registration Act  1906  requiring all Indians to register and carry passes  11  In 1910 the Union of South Africa was created as a self governing dominion that continued the legislative program  the South Africa Act  1910  that enfranchised whites  giving them complete political control over all other race groups and removing the right of blacks to sit in parliament  12  the Native Land Act  1913  which prevented all blacks  except those in the Cape  from buying land outside  reserves   12  the Natives in Urban Areas Bill  1918  designed to force blacks into  locations   13  the Urban Areas Act  1923  which introduced residential segregation and provided cheap labour for industry led by white people  the Colour Bar Act  1926   preventing anyone black from practising skilled trades  the Native Administration Act  1927  that made the British Crown  rather than paramount chiefs  the supreme head over all African affairs  14  the Native Land and Trust Act  1936  that complemented the 1913 Native Land Act and  in the same year  the Representation of Natives Act  which removed previous black voters from the Cape voters  roll and allowed them to elect three whites to represent them in Parliament  15  One of the first pieces of segregating legislation enacted by the Jan Smuts  United Party government was the Asiatic Land Tenure Bill  1946   which banned any further land sales to Indians  16  For example  before the laws mine owners preferred hiring black workers because they were cheaper  Because the market forces direct against discrimination  the whites had to persuade the government to enact laws that highly restricted the black  rights to work  in order to get higher wages than their comparative performance would otherwise yield  Jan Smuts  United Party government began to move away from the rigid enforcement of segregationist laws during World War II  17  Amid fears integration would eventually lead the nation to racial assimilation  the legislature established the Sauer Commission to investigate the effects of the United Party s policies  The commission concluded integration would bring about a  loss of personality  for all racial groups   edit  Institution of apartheid  edit  The election of 1948 Main article  South African general election  1948 In the run up to the 1948 elections  the main Afrikaner nationalist party  the Herenigde Nasionale Party  Reunited National Party  under the leadership of Protestant cleric Daniel Francois Malan  campaigned on its policy of apartheid  18  19  The NP narrowly defeated Smuts s United Party and formed a coalition government with another Afrikaner nationalist party  the Afrikaner Party  Malan became the first apartheid prime minister  and the two parties later merged to form the National Party  NP    edit  Apartheid legislation  Petty apartheid   sign on Durban beach in English  Afrikaans

1983   No new legislation introduced  rather the existing legislation named was amended  This box  view talk edit Main article  Apartheid legislation in South Africa National Party leaders argued that South Africa did not comprise a single nation  but was made up of four distinct racial groups  white  black  coloured  and Indian  These groups were split further into thirteen nations or racial federations  White people encompassed the English and Afrikaans language groups  the black populace was divided into ten such groups  The state passed laws which paved the way for  grand apartheid   which was centred on separating races on a large scale  by compelling people to live in separate places defined by race  This strategy was in part adopted from  left over  British rule that separated different racial groups after they took control of the Boer republics in the Anglo Boer war  This created the so called black only  townships  or  locations  where blacks were relocated in their own towns   In addition   petty apartheid  laws were passed  The principal apartheid laws were as follows  20  The first grand apartheid law was the Population Registration Act of 1950  which formalised racial classification and introduced an identity card for all persons over the age of eighteen  specifying their racial group  21  Official teams or Boards were established to come to an ultimate conclusion on those people whose race was unclear  22  This caused difficulty  especially for coloured people  separating their families as members were allocated different races  23  The second pillar of grand apartheid was the Group Areas Act of 1950  24  Until then  most settlements had people of different races living side by side  This Act put an end to diverse areas and determined where one lived according to race  Each race was allotted its own area  which was used in later years as a basis of forced removal  25  Further legislation which   in 1951 allowed the government to demolish black shackland slums and forced white employers to pay for the construction of housing for those black workers who were permitted to reside in cities otherwise reserved for white people  The Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act of 1949 prohibited marriage between persons of different races  and the Immorality Act of 1950 made sexual relations with a person of a different race a criminal offence  Under the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act of 1953  municipal grounds could be reserved for a particular race  creating  among other things  separate beaches  buses  hospitals  schools and universities  Signboards such as  whites only  applied to public areas  even including park benches  26  Black people were provided with services greatly inferior to those of whites  and  to a lesser extent  to those of Indian and coloured people  2  Further laws had the aim of suppressing resistance  especially armed resistance  to apartheid  The Suppression of Communism Act of 1950 not only banned the South African Communist Party and any other party subscribing to Communism  but defined Communism and its aims so sweepingly that it had the effect of legally gagging any opposition to government policy  especially to apartheid  Disorderly gatherings were banned  as were certain organisations that were deemed threatening to the government  Education was segregated by means of the 1953 Bantu Education Act  which crafted a separate system of education for African students and was designed to prepare black people for lives as a labouring class  27  In 1959 separate universities were created for black  coloured and Indian people  Existing universities were not permitted to enroll new black students  The Afrikaans Medium Decree of 1974 required the use of Afrikaans and English on an equal basis in high schools outside the homelands  28  The Bantu Authorities Act of 1951 created separate government structures for black and white citizens and was the first piece of legislation established to support the government s plan of separate development in the Bantustans  The Promotion of Black Self Government Act of 1959 entrenched the National Party s policy of nominally independent  homelands  for black people  So called  self governing Bantu units  were proposed  which would have devolved administrative powers  with the promise later of autonomy and self government  It also abolished the seats of white representatives of Africans and removed the few blacks still qualified to vote from the rolls altogether  The Bantu Investment Corporation Act of 1959 set up a mechanism to transfer capital to the homelands in order to create employment there  Legislation of 1967 allowed the government to stop industrial development in  white  cities and redirect such development to the  homelands   The Black Homeland Citizenship Act of 1970 marked a new phase in the Bantustan strategy  It changed the status of black people living in South Africa so that they were no longer citizens of South Africa  but became citizens of one of the ten autonomous territories  The aim was to ensure a demographic majority of white people within South Africa by having all ten Bantustans achieve full independence  Interracial contact in sport was frowned upon  but there were no segregatory sports laws  The government tightened existing pass laws  compelling black South Africans to carry identity documents to prevent the migration of blacks to South Africa  Any black residents of cities had to be in employment  Up until 1956 women were for the most part excluded from these pass requirements as attempts to introduce pass laws for women were met with fierce resistance  29   edit  Disenfranchisement of coloured voters In 1950  D F Malan announced the NP s intention to create a Coloured Affairs Department  30 J G  Strijdom  Malan s successor as Prime Minister  moved to strip voting rights from black and coloured residents of the Cape Province  The previous government had first introduced the Separate Representation of Voters Bill in parliament in 1951  however  a group of four voters  G Harris  WD Franklin  WD Collins and Edgar Deane  challenged its validity in court with support from the United Party  31  The Cape Supreme Court upheld the act  but the Appeal Court reversed on appeal  finding the act invalid because a two thirds majority in a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament was needed in order to change the entrenched clauses of the Constitution  32  The government then introduced the High Court of Parliament Bill  1952   which gave parliament the power to overrule decisions of the court  33  The Cape Supreme Court and the Appeal Court declared this invalid too  34  In 1955 the Strijdom government increased the number of judges in the Appeal Court from five to eleven  and appointed pro Nationalist judges to fill the new places  35  In the same year they introduced the Senate Act  which increased the senate from 49 seats to 89  36  Adjustments were made such that the NP controlled 77 of these seats  37  The parliament met in a joint sitting and passed the Separate Representation of Voters Act in 1956  which transferred coloured voters from the common voters  roll in the Cape to a new coloured voters  roll  38  Immediately after the vote  the Senate was restored to its original size  The Senate Act was contested in the Supreme Court  but the recently enlarged Appeal Court  packed with government supporting judges  rejected the application by the Opposition and upheld the Senate Act  and also the Act to remove coloured voters  39  The 1956 law allowed Coloureds to elect four whites to represent them in Parliament  but a 1969 law abolished those seats and stripped Coloureds of their right to vote  Since Asians had never been allowed to vote  this resulted in whites being the sole enfranchised group in the country   edit  Unity among white South Africans Before South Africa became a republic  politics among white South Africans was typified by the division between the chiefly Afrikaner pro republic conservative and the largely English anti republican liberal sentiments  40  with the legacy of the Boer War still a factor for some people  Once republican status was attained  Verwoerd called for improved relations and greater accord between those of British descent and the Afrikaners  41  He claimed that the only difference now was between those who supported apartheid and those in opposition to it  The ethnic divide would no longer be between Afrikaans speakers and English speakers  but rather white and black ethnicities  Most Afrikaners supported the notion of unanimity of white people to ensure their safety  White voters of British descent were divided  Many had opposed a republic  leading to a majority  no  vote in Natal  42  Later  however  some of them recognised the perceived need for white unity  convinced by the growing trend of decolonisation elsewhere in Africa  which left them apprehensive  Harold Macmillan s  Wind of Change  pronouncement left the British faction feeling that Britain had abandoned them  43  The more conservative English speakers gave support to Verwoerd  44  others were troubled by the severing of ties with Britain and remained loyal to the Crown  45  They were acutely displeased at the choice between British and South African nationality  Although Verwoerd tried to bond these different blocs  the subsequent ballot illustrated only a minor swell of support  46  indicating that a great many English speakers remained apathetic and that Verwoerd had not succeeded in uniting the white population   edit  Homeland system Main article  Bantustan Map showing the location of bantustans in South Africa A rural area in Ciskei  one of the apartheid era homelands Under the homeland system  the South African government attempted to divide South Africa into a number of separate states  each of which was supposed to develop into a separate nation state for a different ethnic group  12  Territorial separation was not a new institution  There were  for example  the  reserves  created under the British government in the nineteenth century  Under apartheid  some thirteen per cent of the land was reserved for black homelands  a relatively small amount compared to the total population  and generally in economically unproductive areas of the country  The Tomlinson Commission of 1954 justified apartheid and the homeland system  but stated that additional land ought to be given to the homelands  a recommendation which was not carried out  citation needed  With the accession to power of Dr Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd in 1958  the policy of  separate development  came into being  with the homeland structure as one of its cornerstones  Verwoerd came to believe in the granting of independence to these homelands  The government justified its plans on the basis that   the  government s policy is  therefore  not a policy of discrimination on the grounds of race or colour  but a policy of differentiation on the ground of nationhood  of different nations  granting to each self determination within the borders of their homelands   hence this policy of separate development   citation needed  Under the homelands system  blacks would no longer be citizens of South Africa  they would instead become citizens of the independent homelands who merely worked in South Africa as foreign migrant labourers on temporary work permits  In 1958 the Promotion of Black Self Government Act was passed  and border industries and the Bantu Investment Corporation were established to promote economic development and the provision of employment in or near the homelands  Many black South Africans who had never resided in their identified homeland were nonetheless forcibly removed from the cities to the homelands  Ten homelands were ultimately allocated to different black ethnic groups  Lebowa  North Sotho  also referred to as Pedi   QwaQwa  South Sotho   Bophuthatswana  Tswana   KwaZulu  Zulu   KaNgwane  Swazi   Transkei and Ciskei  Xhosa   Gazankulu  Tsonga   Venda  Venda  and KwaNdebele  Ndebele   Four of these were declared independent by the South African government  Transkei in 1976  Bophuthatswana in 1977  Venda in 1979  and Ciskei in 1981  also known as the TBVC states   Once a homeland was granted its nominal independence  its designated citizens had their South African citizenship revoked  replaced with citizenship in their homeland  These people were then issued passports instead of passbooks  Citizens of the nominally autonomous homelands also had their South African citizenship circumscribed  meaning they were no longer legally considered South African  47  The South African government attempted to draw an equivalence between their view of black citizens of the homelands and the problems which other countries faced through entry of illegal immigrants   edit  International Recognition of the Bantustans International recognition for these new countries was extremely limited  Each TBVC state extended recognition to the other independent Bantustans while South Africa showed its commitment to the notion of TBVC sovereignty by building embassies in the various TBVC capitals  Israel was the only internationally recognised country and UN member to afford some sort of diplomatic recognition to any of the Bantustans  though formal acknowledgment of the Bantustans as fully fledged countries never occurred  48  In late 1982  the Ciskei Trade Mission opened in Tel Aviv  flying its own flag and staffed by two Israelis  Yosef Schneider and Nat Rosenwasser  who were employed by the Ciskei Foreign Ministry  2  Bophuthatswana also had a representative in Israel  Shabtai Kalmanovich  48  who in 1988 was sentenced by Israel to seven years in jail for spying for the KGB  49  In 1983 Israel was visited by the presidents of both Bophuthatswana and Ciskei  as well as by Venda s entire chamber of commerce  48  During this visit Lennox Sebe  the Ciskeian President secured a contract with the Israeli government to supply and train his armed forces  48  Initially  six planes   at least one a military helicopter   were sold to Ciskei  and 18 Ciskei residents arrived in Israel for pilot training  48  In 1985 Israel received Buthelezi as Chief Minister of KwaZulu during an unofficial visit in 1985  48   edit  Forced removals During the 1960s  1970s and early 1980s  the government implemented a policy of  resettlement   to force people to move to their designated  group areas   Millions of people were forced to relocate during this period  These removals included people re located due to slum clearance programmes  labour tenants on white owned farms  the inhabitants of the so called  black spots   areas of black owned land surrounded by white farms  the families of workers living in townships close to the homelands  and  surplus people  from urban areas  including thousands of people from the Western Cape  which was declared a  Coloured Labour Preference Area  50   who were moved to the Transkei and Ciskei homelands  The best publicised forced removals of the 1950s occurred in Johannesburg  when 60 000 people were moved to the new township of Soweto  an abbreviation for South Western Townships  51  52  Until 1955 Sophiatown had been one of the few urban areas where blacks were allowed to own land  and was slowly developing into a multiracial slum  As industry in Johannesburg grew  Sophiatown became the home of a rapidly expanding black workforce  as it was convenient and close to town  It could also boast the only swimming pool for black children in Johannesburg  53  As one of the oldest black settlements in Johannesburg  Sophiatown held an almost symbolic importance for the 50 000 blacks it contained  both in terms of its sheer vibrancy and its unique culture  Despite a vigorous ANC protest campaign and worldwide publicity  the removal of Sophiatown began on 9 February 1955 under the Western Areas Removal Scheme  In the early hours  heavily armed police entered Sophiatown to force residents out of their homes and load their belongings onto government trucks  The residents were taken to a large tract of land  thirteen miles  19 km  from the city centre  known as Meadowlands  that the government had purchased in 1953   Meadowlands became part of a new planned black city called Soweto  The Sophiatown slum was destroyed by bulldozers  and a new white suburb named Triomf  Triumph  was built in its place  This pattern of forced removal and destruction was to repeat itself over the next few years  and was not limited to people of African descent  Forced removals from areas like Cato Manor  Mkhumbane  in Durban  and District Six in Cape Town  where 55 000 coloured and Indian people were forced to move to new townships on the Cape Flats  were carried out under the Group Areas Act of 1950  Ultimately  nearly 600 000 coloured  Indian and Chinese people were moved in terms of the Group Areas Act  Some 40 000 white people were also forced to move when land was transferred from  white South Africa  into the black homelands  citation needed   edit  Petty apartheid Racial demographic map of South Africa published by CIA in 1979 with data from the 1970 South African census The National Party passed a string of legislation which became known as petty apartheid  The first of these was the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act 55 of 1949  prohibiting marriage between white people and people of other races  The Immorality Amendment Act 21 of 1950  as amended in 1957 by Act 23  forbade  unlawful racial intercourse  and  any immoral or indecent act  between a white person and an African  Indian or coloured person  Blacks were not allowed to run businesses or professional practices in those areas designated as  white South Africa  without a permit  They were supposed to move to the black  homelands  and set up businesses and practices there  Transport and civil facilities were segregated  Black buses stopped at black bus stops and white buses at white ones  Trains  hospitals and ambulances were segregated  54  Because of the smaller numbers of white patients and the fact that white doctors preferred to work in white hospitals  conditions in white hospitals were much better than those in often overcrowded black hospitals  55  Blacks were excluded from living or working in white areas  unless they had a pass nicknamed the dompas   dumb pass  in Afrikaans   Only blacks with  Section 10  rights  those who had migrated to the cities before World War II  were excluded from this provision  A pass was issued only to a black person with approved work  Spouses and children had to be left behind in black homelands  A pass was issued for one magisterial district  usually one town  confining the holder to that area only  Being without a valid pass made a person subject to arrest and trial for being an illegal migrant  This was often followed by deportation to the person s homeland and prosecution of the employer  for employing an illegal migrant   Police vans patrolled the white areas to round up illegal blacks found there without passes  Black people were not allowed to employ white people in white South Africa  Although trade unions for black and coloured  mixed race  workers had existed since the early 20th century  it was not until the 1980s reforms that a mass black trade union movement developed  The trade unions which existed under apartheid were racially segregated  with 54 unions being white only  38 for Indian and coloured and 19 for African people  The Industrial Conciliation Act  1956  legislated against the creation of multi racial trade unions and attempted to split existing multi racial trade unions into separate branches or organizations along racial lines  56  In the 1970s each black child s education within the Bantu Education system  the education system practised in black schools within white South Africa  cost the state only a tenth of each white child s  Higher education was provided in separate universities and colleges after 1959  Eight black universities were created in the homelands  Fort Hare University in the Ciskei  now Eastern Cape  was to register only Xhosa speaking students  Sotho  Tswana  Pedi and Venda speakers were placed at the newly founded University College of the North at Turfloop  while the University College of Zululand was launched to serve Zulu scholars  Coloureds and Indians were to have their own establishments in the Cape and Natal respectively  citation needed  In addition  each black homeland controlled its own separate education  health and police system  Blacks were not allowed to buy hard liquor  They were able only to buy state produced poor quality beer  although this was relaxed later   Public beaches were racially segregated  Public swimming pools  some pedestrian bridges  drive in cinema parking spaces  graveyards  parks  and public toilets were segregated  Cinemas and theatres in white areas were not allowed to admit blacks  There were practically no cinemas in black areas  Most restaurants and hotels in white areas were not allowed to admit blacks except as staff  Black Africans were prohibited from attending white churches under the Churches Native Laws Amendment Act of 1957  This was  however  never rigidly enforced  and churches were one of the few places races could mix without the interference of the law  Blacks earning 360 rand a year  30 rand a month  or more had to pay taxes while the white threshold was more than twice as high  at 750 rand a year  62 5 rand per month  On the other hand  the taxation rate for whites was considerably higher than that for blacks  citation needed  Blacks could never acquire land in white areas  In the homelands  much of the land belonged to a  tribe   where the local chieftain would decide how the land had to be used  This resulted in white people owning almost all the industrial and agricultural lands and much of the prized residential land  Most blacks were stripped of their South African citizenship when the  homelands  became  independent   Thus  they were no longer able to apply for South African passports  Eligibility requirements for a passport had been difficult for blacks to meet  the government contending that a passport was a privilege  not a right  As such  the government did not grant many passports to blacks  Apartheid pervaded South African culture  as well as the law  This was reinforced by much of the media  and the lack of opportunities for the races to mix in a social setting entrenched social distance between people

denote their legal definitions in South African law   The Coloured group included people regarded as being of mixed descent  including people of Bantu  Khoisan  European and Malay ancestry  Many were descended from people brought to South Africa from other parts of the world  such as India  Madagascar  China and the Philippines  as slaves and indentured workers  57  The Apartheid bureaucracy devised complex  and often arbitrary  criteria at the time that the Population Registration Act was implemented to determine who was Coloured  Minor officials would administer tests to determine if someone should be categorised either Coloured or Black  or if another person should be categorised either Coloured or White  Different members of the same family found themselves in different race groups  Further tests determined membership of the various sub racial groups of the Coloureds  Many of those who formerly belonged to this racial group are opposed to the continuing use of the term  coloured  in the post apartheid era  though the term no longer signifies any legal meaning  The expressions  so called Coloured   Afrikaans sogenaamde Kleurlinge  and  brown people   bruinmense  acquired a wide usage in the 1980s  Discriminated against by apartheid  Coloureds were as a matter of state policy forced to live in separate townships in some cases leaving homes their families had occupied for generations and received an inferior education  though better than that provided to Black South Africans  They played an important role in the anti apartheid movement  for example the African Political Organization established in 1902 had an exclusively coloured membership  Voting rights were denied to Coloureds in the same way that they were denied to blacks from 1950 to 1983  However  in 1977 the NP caucus approved proposals to bring Coloureds and Indians into central government  In 1982  final constitutional proposals produced a referendum among white voters  and the Tricameral Parliament was approved  The Constitution was reformed the following year to allow the Coloured and Asian minorities participation in separate Houses in a Tricameral Parliament  and Botha became the first Executive State President  The idea was that the Coloured minority could be granted voting rights  but the Black majority were to become citizens of independent homelands  These separate arrangements continued until the abolition of apartheid  The Tricameral reforms led to the formation of the  anti apartheid  UDF as a vehicle to try to prevent the co option of Coloureds and Indians into an alliance with white South Africans  The subsequent battles between the UDF and the NP government from 1983 to 1989 were to become the most intense period of struggle between left wing and right wing South Africans   edit  Women under apartheid Colonialism and apartheid had a major impact on women since they suffered both racial and gender discrimination  Oppression against African women was different from discrimination against men  They had very few or no legal rights  no access to education and no right to own property  58  Jobs were often hard to find but many African women worked as agricultural or domestic workers though wages were extremely low  if existent  59  Children suffered from diseases caused by malnutrition and sanitary problems  and mortality rates were therefore high  The controlled movement of African workers within the country through the Natives Urban Areas Act of 1923 and the pass laws  separated family members from one another as men usually worked in urban centres  while women were forced to stay in rural areas  Marriage law and births 60  were also controlled by the government and the pro apartheid Dutch Reformed Church  who tried to restrict African birth rates   edit  Sports under apartheid By the 1930s  Association football mirrored the balkanised society of South Africa  football was divided into numerous institutions based on race  the  White  South African Football Association  the South African Indian Football Association  SAIFA   the South African African Football Association  SAAFA  and its rival the South African Bantu Football Association  and lastly  the South African Coloured Football Association  SACFA   Lack of funds to provide proper equipment would be noticeable in regards to black amateur football matches  this revealed the unequal lives Africans would were subject to  in contrast to Whites who were obviously much better off financially  61  Apartheid s social engineering made it more difficult to compete across racial lines  thus in an effort to centralise finances the federations merged in 1951  creating the South African Soccer Federation  SASF   which brought Black  Indian and Coloured national associations into one body that opposed apartheid  This was generally opposed more and more by the growing apartheid government and with urban segregation being reinforced with ongoing racist policies  it was harder to play football along these racial lines  In 1956  the Pretoria regime  the administrative capital of South Africa  passed the first apartheid sports policy  by doing so  it emphasised the White led government s opposition to inter racialism  While football was plagued by racism  it also played a role in protesting apartheid and its policies  With the international bans from FIFA and other major sporting events  South Africa would be in the spotlight internationally  In a 1977 survey  white South Africans ranked the lack of international sport as one of the three most damaging consequences of apartheid  62  By the mid fifties  Black South Africans would also use media to challenge the  racialisation  of sports in South Africa  anti apartheid forces had begun to pinpoint sport as the  weakness  of white national morale  Black journalists on the Johannesburg Drum magazine were the first to give the issue public exposure  with an intrepid special issue in 1955 that asked   Why shouldn t our blacks be allowed in the SA team   62  As time progressed  international standing with South Africa would continue to be strained  In the 80s  as the oppressive system was slowly collapsing the ANC and National Party started negotiations on the end of apartheid  Football associations also discussed the formation of a single  non racial controlling body  This unity process accelerated in the late 1980s and led to the creation  in December 1991  of an incorporated South African Football Association  On 3 July 1992  FIFA finally welcomed South Africa back into international football  Sport has long been an important part of life in South Africa  and the boycotting of games by international teams had a profound effect on the white population  perhaps more so than the trade embargoes did  After the re acceptance of South Africa s sports teams by the international community  Sport played a major unifying role between the country s races  Nelson Mandela s open support of the previously white dominated rugby fraternity when South Africa hosted and won the 1995 Rugby World Cup went a long way to repairing broken race relations   edit  Other minorities Defining its East Asian population  a minority in South Africa who do not appear to belong to any of the four designated groups  was a constant dilemma for the apartheid government  Chinese South Africans who were descendants of migrant workers who came to work in the gold mines around Johannesburg in the late 19th century  were classified as  Other Asian  and hence  non white   whereas immigrants from Japan and Taiwan  with which South Africa maintained diplomatic and economic relations  were considered  honorary whites  with the same privileges as normal whites  63   edit  Conservatism The National Party government implemented  alongside apartheid  a programme of social conservatism  Pornography  64  gambling 65  and other such vices were banned  Cinemas  shops selling alcohol and most other businesses were forbidden from operating on Sundays  66 Abortion  67 homosexuality 68  and sex education were also restricted  abortion was legal only in cases of rape or if the mother s life was threatened  67  Television was not introduced until 1976 because the government viewed English programming as a threat to the Afrikaans language  69  Television was also run on apartheid lines   TV1 broadcast in Afrikaans and English  geared to a white audience   TV2 in Zulu and Xhosa and TV3 in Sotho  Tswana and Pedi  both geared to a black audience   and TV4 mostly showed programmes for an urban black audience   edit  Internal resistance Main article  Internal resistance to South African apartheid The system of apartheid sparked significant internal resistance  3  The government responded to a series of popular uprisings and protests with police brutality  which in turn increased local support for the armed resistance struggle  70  Internal resistance to the apartheid system in South Africa came from several sectors of society and saw the creation of organisations dedicated variously to peaceful protests  passive resistance and armed insurrection  In 1949 the youth wing of the African National Congress  ANC  took control of the organisation and started advocating a radical black nationalist programme  The new young leaders proposed that white authority could only be overthrown through mass campaigns  In 1950 that philosophy saw the launch of the Programme of Action  a series of strikes  boycotts and civil disobedience actions that led to occasionally violent clashes with the authorities  In 1959 a group of disenchanted ANC members formed the Pan Africanist Congress  PAC   which organised a demonstration against pass books on 21 March 1960  One of those protests was held in the township of Sharpeville  where 69 people were killed by police in the Sharpeville massacre  In the wake of the Sharpeville incident the government declared a state of emergency  More than 18 000 people were arrested  including leaders of the ANC and PAC  and both organisations were banned  The resistance went underground  with some leaders in exile abroad and others engaged in campaigns of domestic sabotage and terrorism  In May 1961  before the declaration of South Africa as a Republic  an assembly representing the banned ANC called for negotiations between the members of the different ethnic groupings  threatening demonstrations and strikes during the inauguration of the Republic if their calls were ignored  When the government overlooked them  the strikers  among the main organizers was a 42 year old  Thembu origin Nelson Mandela  carried out their threats  The government countered swiftly by giving police the authority to arrest people for up to twelve days and detaining many strike leaders amid numerous cases of police brutality  71  Defeated  the protesters called off their strike  The ANC then chose to launch an armed struggle through a newly formed military wing  Umkhonto we Sizwe  MK   which would perform acts of sabotage on tactical state structures  Its first sabotage plans were carried out on 16 December 1961  the anniversary of the Battle of Blood River  In the 1970s the Black Consciousness Movement was created by tertiary students influenced by the American Black Power movement  BC endorsed black pride and African customs and did much to alter the feelings of inadequacy instilled among black people by the apartheid system  The leader of the movement  Steve Biko  was taken into custody on 18 August 1977 and was murdered in detention  In 1976 secondary students in Soweto took to the streets in the Soweto uprising to protest against forced tuition in Afrikaans  On 16 June  police opened fire on students in what was meant to be a peaceful protest  According to official reports 23 people were killed  but news agencies put the number as high as 600 killed and 4000 injured  72  In the following years several student organisations were formed with the goal of protesting against apartheid  and these organisations were central to urban school boycotts in 1980 and 1983 as well as rural boycotts in 1985 and 1986  In parallel to student protests  labour unions started protest action in 1973 and 1974  After 1976 unions and workers are considered to have played an important role in the struggle against apartheid  filling the gap left by the banning of political parties  In 1979 black trade unions were legalised and could engage in collective bargaining  although strikes were still illegal  At roughly the same time churches and church groups also emerged as pivotal points of resistance  Church leaders were not immune to prosecution  and certain faith based organisations were banned  but the clergy generally had more freedom to criticise the government than militant groups did  Although the majority of whites supported apartheid  some 20 percent did not  Parliamentary opposition was galvanised by Helen Suzman  Colin Eglin and Harry Schwarz who formed the Progressive Federal Party  Extra parliamentary resistance was largely centred in the South African Communist Party and women s organisation the Black Sash  Women were also notable in their involvement in trade union organisations and banned political parties   edit  International relations International

when British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan criticised them during his celebrated Wind of Change speech in Cape Town  Weeks later  tensions came to a head in the Sharpeville Massacre  resulting in more international condemnation  Soon thereafter  Verwoerd announced a referendum on whether the country should become a republic  Verwoerd lowered the voting age for whites to eighteen and included whites in South West Africa on the voter s roll  The referendum on 5 October that year asked whites   Are you in favour of a Republic for the Union    and 52 percent voted  Yes   73  As a consequence of this change of status  South Africa needed to reapply for continued membership of the Commonwealth  with which it had privileged trade links  Even though India became a republic within the Commonwealth in 1950 it became clear that African and Asian member states would oppose South Africa due to its apartheid policies  As a result  South Africa withdrew from the Commonwealth on 31 May 1961  the day that the Republic came into existence   edit  United Nations  We speak out to put the world on guard against what is happening in South Africa  The brutal policy of apartheid is applied before the eyes of the nations of the world  The peoples of Africa are compelled to endure the fact that on the African continent the superiority of one race over another remains official policy  and that in the name of this racial superiority murder is committed with impunity  Can the United Nations do nothing to stop this     Che Guevara  speech to the United Nations as Cuba s representative  December 11  1964 74  At the first UN gathering in 1946  South Africa was placed on the agenda  The primary subject in question was the handling of South African Indians  a great cause of divergence between South Africa and India  In 1952  apartheid was again discussed in the aftermath of the Defiance Campaign  and the UN set up a task team to keep watch on the progress of apartheid and the racial state of affairs in South Africa  Although South Africa s racial policies were a cause for concern  most countries in the UN concurred that this was a domestic affair  which fell outside the UN s jurisdiction  75  In April 1960  the UN s conservative stance on apartheid changed following the Sharpeville massacre  and the Security Council for the first time agreed on concerted action against the apartheid regime  demanding an end to racial separation and discrimination  From 1960 the ANC began a campaign of armed struggle of which there would later be a charge of 193 acts of terrorism from 1961 to 1963  mainly bombings and murders of civilians  Instead  the South African government then began further suppression  banning the ANC and PAC  In 1961  UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskj ld stopped over in South Africa and subsequently stated that he had been unable to reach agreement with Prime Minister Verwoerd  On 6 November 1962  the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 1761  condemning South African apartheid policies  In 1966  the UN held the first of many colloquiums on apartheid  The General Assembly announced 21 March as the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination  in memory of the Sharpeville massacre  76  In 1971  the General Assembly formally denounced the institution of homelands  and a motion was passed in 1974 to expel South Africa from the UN  but this was vetoed by France  Britain and the United States of America  all key trade associates of South Africa  77  On 7 August 1963 the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 181 calling for a voluntary arms embargo against South Africa  and in the same year  a Special Committee Against Apartheid was established to encourage and oversee plans of action against the regime  From 1964  the US and Britain discontinued their arms trade with South Africa  It also condemned the Soweto massacre in Resolution 392  In 1977  the voluntary UN arms embargo became mandatory with the passing of United Nations Security Council Resolution 418  Economic sanctions against South Africa were also frequently debated as an effective way of putting pressure on the apartheid government  In 1962  the UN General Assembly requested that its members sever political  fiscal and transportation ties with South Africa  In 1968  it proposed ending all cultural  educational and sporting connections as well  Economic sanctions  however  were not made mandatory  because of opposition from South Africa s main trading partners  In 1973  the UN adopted the Apartheid Convention which defines apartheid and even qualifies it as a crime against humanity which might lead to international criminal prosecution of the individuals responsible for perpetrating it  78  In 1978 and 1983 the UN condemned South Africa at the World Conference Against Racism  and a significant divestment movement started  pressuring investors to disinvest from South African companies or companies that did business with South Africa  After much debate  by the late 1980s the United States  the United Kingdom  and 23 other nations had passed laws placing various trade sanctions on South Africa  79  A divestment movement in many countries was similarly widespread  with individual cities and provinces around the world implementing various laws and local regulations forbidding registered corporations under their jurisdiction from doing business with South African firms  factories  or banks  80   edit  Organization for African Unity The Organisation of African Unity  OAU  was created in 1963  Its primary objectives were to eradicate colonialism and improve social  political and economic situations in Africa  It censured apartheid and demanded sanctions against South Africa  African states agreed to aid the liberation movements in their fight against apartheid  81  In 1969  fourteen nations from Central and East Africa gathered in Lusaka  Zambia  and formulated the  Lusaka Manifesto   which was signed on 13 April by all of the countries in attendance except Malawi  82  This manifesto was later taken on by both the OAU and the United Nations  81  The Lusaka Manifesto summarised the political situations of self governing African countries  condemning racism and inequity  and calling for black majority rule in all African nations  83  It did not rebuff South Africa entirely  though  adopting an appeasing manner towards the apartheid government  and even recognising its autonomy  Although African leaders supported the emancipation of black South Africans  they preferred this to be attained through peaceful means  84  South Africa s negative response to the Lusaka Manifesto and rejection of a change to her policies brought about another OAU announcement in October 1971  The Mogadishu Declaration declared that South Africa s rebuffing of negotiations meant that her black people could only be freed through military means  and that no African state should converse with the apartheid government  85  Henceforth  it would be up to South Africa to keep contact with other African states   edit  Outward looking policy This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  In 1966  B J  Vorster was made South African Prime Minister  He was not prepared to dismantle apartheid  but he did try to redress South Africa s isolation and to revitalise the country s global reputation  even those with black ruled nations in Africa  This he called his  Outward Looking  policy  the buzzwords for his strategy were  dialogue  and  d tente   signifying a reduction of tension  Vorster s willingness to talk to African leaders stood in contrast to Verwoerd s refusal to engage with leaders such as Abubakar Tafawa Balewa of Nigeria in 1962 and Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia in 1964  In 1966  Vorster met with the heads of the neighbouring states of Lesotho  Swaziland and Botswana  In 1967  Vorster offered technological and financial aid to any African state prepared to receive it  asserting that no political strings were attached  aware that many African states needed financial aid despite their opposition to South Africa s racial policies  Many were also tied to South Africa economically because of their migrant labour population working on the South African mines  Botswana  Lesotho and Swaziland remained outspoken critics of apartheid  but depended on South Africa s economic aid  Malawi was the first country not on South African borders to accept South African aid  In 1967  the two states set out their political and economic relations  and  in 1969  Malawi became the only country at the assembly which did not sign the Lusaka Manifesto condemning South Africa  apartheid policy  In 1970  Malawian president Hastings Banda made his first and most successful official stopover in South Africa  Associations with Mozambique followed suit and were sustained after that country won its sovereignty in 1975  Angola was also granted South African loans  Other countries which formed relationships with South Africa were Liberia  Ivory Coast  Madagascar  Mauritius  Gabon  Zaire  now the Democratic Republic of the Congo   Ghana and the Central African Republic  Although these states condemned apartheid  more than ever after South Africa s denunciation of the Lusaka Manifesto   South Africa s economic and military dominance meant that they remained dependent on South Africa to varying degrees   edit  Cultural and sporting isolation Main article  Sporting boycott of South Africa South Africa s isolation in sport began in the mid 1950s and increased throughout the 1960s  Apartheid forbade multiracial sport  which meant that overseas teams  by virtue of their having players of diverse races  could not play in South Africa  In 1956  the International Table Tennis Federation severed its ties with the all white South African Table Tennis Union  preferring the non racial South African Table Tennis Board  The apartheid government responded by confiscating the passports of the Board s players so that they were unable to attend international games  In 1959  the non racial South African Sports Association  SASA  was formed to secure the rights of all players on the global field  After meeting with no success in its endeavours to attain credit by collaborating with white establishments  SASA approached the International Olympic Committee  IOC  in 1962  calling for South Africa s expulsion from the Olympic Games  The IOC sent South Africa a caution to the effect that  if there were no changes  they would be barred from the 1964 Olympic Games  The changes were initiated  and in January 1963  the South African Non Racial Olympic Committee  SANROC  was set up  The Anti Apartheid Movement persisted in its campaign for South Africa s exclusion  and the IOC acceded in barring the country from the 1964 Games in Tokyo  South Africa selected a multi racial team for the next Games  and the IOC opted for incorporation in the 1968 Games in Mexico  Because of protests from AAMs and African nations  however  the IOC was forced to retract the invitation  Foreign complaints about South Africa s bigoted sports brought more isolation  Racially selected New Zealand sports teams toured South Africa  until the 1970 New Zealand All Blacks rugby tour allowed Maori to go under the status of  honorary whites   Huge and widespread protest occurred in New Zealand in 1981 against the Springbok tour  the government spent eight million dollars protecting games using the army and police force  A planned All Black tour to South Africa in 1985 remobilised the New Zealand protestors and it was cancelled  A  rebel tour  not government sanctioned went ahead in 1986  but after that sporting ties were cut  and New Zealand made a decision not to convey an authorised rugby team to South Africa until the end of apartheid  86  B  J  Vorster took Verwoerd s place as Prime Minister in 1966 and declared that South Africa would no longer dictate to other countries what their teams should look like  Although this reopened the gate for sporting meets  it did not signal the end of South Africa s racist sporting policies  In 1968  Vorster went against his policy by refusing to permit Basil D Oliveira  a Coloured South African born cricketer  to join the English cricket team on its tour to South Africa  Vorster said that the side had been chosen only to prove a point  and not on merit  After protests  however   Dolly  was eventually included in the team  Protests against certain tours brought about the cancellation of a number of other visits  like that of an England rugby team touring South Africa in 1969 70  The first of the  White Bans  occurred in 1971 when the Chairman of the Australian Cricketing Association  Don Bradman flew to South Africa to meet with the South African Prime Minister John Vorster  The Prime Minister had expected Bradman to allow the tour of the Australian cricket team to go ahead  but things became heated after Bradman asked why black sportsmen were not allowed to play cricket  Vorster stated that blacks were intellectually inferior and had no finesse for the game  Bradman  thinking this ignorant and repugnant  asked Vorster if he had heard of a man named Garry Sobers  On his return to Australia  Bradman released a one sentence statement  cite this quote   We will not play them until they choose a team on a non racist basis   In South Africa  Vorster vented his anger publicly against Bradman  while the African National Congress rejoiced  This was the first time a predominantly white nation had taken the side of multiracial sport  producing an unsettling resonance that more  White  boycotts were coming   87  Almost twenty years later  on his release from prison  Nelson Mandela asked a visiting Australian statesman if Donald Bradman  his childhood hero  was still alive  In 1971  Vorster altered his policies even further by distinguishing multiracial from multinational sport  Multiracial sport  between teams with players of different races  remained outlawed  multinational sport  however  was now acceptable  international sides would not be subject to South Africa s racial stipulations  In 1978  Nigeria boycotted the Commonwealth Games because New Zealand s sporting contacts with the South African government were not considered to be in accordance with the 1977 Gleneagles Agreement  Nigeria also led the 32 nation boycott of the 1986 Commonwealth Games because of British prime minister Margaret Thatcher s ambivalent attitude towards sporting links with South Africa  significantly affecting the quality and profitability of the Games and thus thrusting apartheid into the international spotlight  88  Sporting bans were revoked in 1993  when conciliations for a democratic South Africa were well under way  In the 1960s  the Anti Apartheid Movements began to campaign for cultural boycotts of apartheid South Africa  Artists were requested not to present or let their works be hosted in South Africa  In 1963  45 British writers put their signatures to an affirmation approving of the boycott  and  in 1964  American actor Marlon Brando called for a similar affirmation for films  In 1965  the Writers  Guild of Great Britain called for a proscription on the sending of films to South Africa  Over sixty American artists signed a statement against apartheid and against professional links with the state  The presentation of some South African plays in Britain and the United States was also vetoed  After the arrival of television in South Africa in 1975  the British Actors Union  Equity  boycotted the service  and no British programme concerning its associates could be sold to South Africa  Sporting and cultural boycotts did not have the same impact as economic sanctions  but they did much to lift consciousness amongst normal South Africans of the global condemnation of apartheid   edit  Western influence  Boycott apartheid  bus in London during 1989 While international opposition to apartheid grew  the Nordic countries in particular provided both moral and financial support for the ANC  89  On 21 February 1986   a week before he was murdered   Sweden s prime minister Olof Palme made the keynote address to the Swedish People s Parliament Against Apartheid held in Stockholm  90  In addressing the hundreds of anti apartheid sympathizers as well as leaders and officials from the ANC and the Anti Apartheid Movement such as Oliver Tambo  Palme declared   Apartheid cannot be reformed  it has to be eliminated   91  Other Western countries adopted a more ambivalent position  In the 1980s  both the Reagan and Thatcher administrations  in the USA and UK respectively  followed a  constructive engagement  policy with the apartheid government  vetoing the imposition of UN economic sanctions on South Africa  justified by a belief in free trade and a vision of South Africa as a bastion against Marxist forces in Southern Africa  Thatcher declared the ANC a terrorist organisation  92  and in 1987 her spokesman  Bernard Ingham  famously said that anyone who believed that the ANC would ever form the government of South Africa was  living in cloud cuckoo land   93  By the late 1980s  however  with the tide of the Cold War turning and no sign of a political resolution in South Africa  Western patience with the apartheid government began to run out  By 1989  a bipartisan Republican Democratic initiative in the US favoured economic sanctions  realised as the Comprehensive Anti Apartheid Act of 1986   the release of Nelson Mandela and a negotiated settlement involving the ANC  Thatcher too began to take a similar line  but insisted on the suspension of the ANC s armed struggle  94  Britain s significant economic involvement in South Africa may have provided some leverage with the South African government  with both the UK and the US applying pressure on the government  and pushing for negotiations  However  neither Britain nor the US were willing to apply economic pressure upon their multinational interests in South Africa  such as the mining company Anglo American  Although a high profile compensation claim against these companies was thrown out of court in 2004  95  the US Supreme Court in May 2008 upheld an appeal court ruling allowing another lawsuit that seeks damages of more than US 400 billion from major international companies which are accused of aiding South Africa s apartheid system  96   edit  South African Border War Main articles  South African Border War  Angolan Civil War  and Cuban intervention in Angola By 1966  SWAPO launched guerilla raids from neighbouring countries against South Africa s occupation of South West Africa  present day Namibia   Initially South Africa fought a counter insurgency war against SWAPO  This conflict deepened after Angola gained its independence in 1975 under the leadership of the leftist Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola  MPLA  aided by Cuba  South Africa  Zaire and the United States sided with the Angolan rival UNITA party against the MPLA s armed force  FAPLA  People s Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola   The following struggle turned into one of several late Cold War flashpoints in the world  97  The Angolan civil war developed into a conventional war with South Africa and UNITA on one side against the Angolan government  the Soviet volunteers  the Cubans and SWAPO on the other  98   edit  Total onslaught By 1980  as international opinion turned decisively against the apartheid regime  the government and much of the white population increasingly looked upon the country as a bastion besieged militarily  politically  culturally  ideologically  economically and socially by communism and radical black nationalists  Considerable effort was put into circumventing sanctions  and the government even went so far as to develop nuclear weapons  with the help of Israel  99  In 2010  The Guardian released South African government documents that revealed an Israeli offer to sell Apartheid South Africa nuclear weapons  100  101  Israel categorically denied these allegations and claimed that the documents were minutes from a meeting which did not indicate any concrete offer for a sale of nuclear weapons  Shimon Peres said that The Guardian article was based on  selective interpretation    and not on concrete facts   102  The term  front line states  referred to countries in Southern Africa geographically near South Africa  Although these front line states were all opposed to apartheid  many were economically dependent on South Africa  In 1980  they formed the Southern African Development Coordination Conference  SADCC   the aim of which was to promote economic development in the region and hence reduce dependence on South Africa  Furthermore  many SADCC members also allowed the exiled ANC and Pan Africanist Congress  PAC  to establish bases in their countries   edit  Cross border raids South Africa had a policy of attacking guerrilla bases and safe houses of the ANC  PAC and SWAPO in neighbouring countries beginning in the early 1980s  103  These attacks were in retaliation for acts of terror such as bomb explosions  massacres and guerrilla actions  like sabotage  by ANC  PAC and SWAPO guerrillas in South Africa and Namibia  The country also aided organisations in surrounding countries who were actively combating the spread of communism in southern Africa  The results of these policies included  Support for anti government guerrilla groups such as UNITA in Angola and RENAMO in Mozambique South African Defence Force  SADF  now the South African National Defence Force  SANDF  hit squad raids into front line states  Bombing raids were also conducted into neighbouring states  Air and commando raids into Zimbabwe  Zambia and Botswana occurred the same day  against selective ANC targets  104  An assassination attempt on Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe on 18 December 1981  105  A full scale invasion of Angola  this was partly in support of UNITA  but was also an attempt to strike at SWAPO bases  106  Bomb attacks in Lesotho  105  Kidnapping of refugees and ANC members in Swaziland by security services  105  An unsuccessful South African organised coup in the Seychelles on 25 November 1981  105  Targeting of exiled ANC leaders abroad  Joe Slovo s wife Ruth First was killed by a parcel bomb in Maputo  and  death squads  of the Civil Cooperation Bureau and the Directorate of Military Intelligence attempted to carry out assassinations on ANC targets in Brussels  Paris  107 Stockholm and London  108  In 1984  Mozambican president Samora Machel signed the Nkomati Accord with South Africa s president P W  Botha  in an attempt to rebuild Mozambique s economy  South Africa agreed to cease supporting anti government forces  while the MK was prohibited from operating in Mozambique  This was a setback for the ANC  Two years later  President Machel was killed in an air crash in mountainous terrain in South Africa near the Mozambican border after returning from a meeting in Zambia  South Africa was accused by the Mozambican government and U S  Secretary of State George P  Shultz of continuing its aid to RENAMO  The Mozambiquan government also made an unproven allegation that the accident was caused intentionally by a false radio navigation beacon that lured the aircraft into crashing  109  110  This conspiracy theory was never proven and is still a subject of some controversy  despite the South African Margo Commission finding that the crash was an accident  A Soviet delegation that did not participate in the investigation issued a minority report implicating South Africa  111   edit  State security During the 1980s the government  led by P W  Botha  became increasingly preoccupied with security  On the advice of American political scientist Samuel P  Huntington  Botha s government set up a powerful state security apparatus to  protect  the state against an anticipated upsurge in political violence that the reforms were expected to trigger  The 1980s became a period of considerable political unrest  with the government becoming increasingly dominated by Botha s circle of generals and police chiefs  known as securocrats   who managed the various States of Emergencies  112  Botha s years in power were marked also by numerous military interventions in the states bordering South Africa  as well as an extensive military and political campaign to eliminate SWAPO in Namibia  Within South Africa  meanwhile  vigorous police action and strict enforcement of security legislation resulted in hundreds of arrests and bans  and an effective end to the ANC s sabotage campaign  The government punished political offenders brutally  40 000 people were subjected to whipping as a form of punishment annually  113  The vast majority had committed political offences and were lashed ten times for their trouble  114  If convicted of treason  a person could be hanged  and the government executed numerous political offenders in this way  As the 1980s progressed  more and more anti apartheid organisations were formed and affiliated with the UDF  Led by the Reverend Allan Boesak and Albertina Sisulu  the UDF called for the government to abandon its reforms and instead abolish apartheid and eliminate the homelands completely   edit  State of emergency Serious political violence was a prominent feature of South Africa from 1985 to 1989  as black townships became the focus of the struggle between anti apartheid organisations and the Botha government  Throughout the 1980s  township people resisted apartheid by acting against the local issues that faced their particular communities  The focus of much of this resistance was against the local authorities and their leaders  who were seen to be supporting the government  By 1985  it had become the ANC s aim to make black townships  ungovernable   a term later replaced by  people s power   by means of rent boycotts and other militant action  Numerous township councils were overthrown or collapsed  to be replaced by unofficial popular organisations  often led by militant youth  People s courts were set up  and residents accused of being government agents were dealt extreme and occasionally lethal punishment  Black town councillors and policemen  and sometimes their families  were attacked with petrol bombs  beaten  and murdered by necklacing  where a burning tyre was placed around the victim s neck  On 20 July 1985  State President P W  Botha declared a State of Emergency in 36 magisterial districts  Areas affected were the Eastern Cape  and the PWV region   Pretoria  Witwatersrand  Vereeniging    115  Three months later the Western Cape was included as well  An increasing number of organisations were banned or listed  restricted in some way   many individuals had restrictions such as house arrest imposed on them  During this state of emergency about 2 436 people were detained under the Internal Security Act  116  This act gave police and the military sweeping powers  The government could implement curfews controlling the movement of people  The president could rule by decree without referring to the constitution or to parliament  It became a criminal offence to threaten someone verbally or possess documents that the government perceived to be threatening  It was illegal to advise anyone to stay away from work or oppose the government  It was illegal  too  to disclose the name of anyone arrested under the State of Emergency until the government saw fit to release that name  People could face up to ten years  imprisonment for these offences  Detention without trial became a common feature of the government s reaction to growing civil unrest and by 1988  30 000 people had been detained  117  The media was censored  thousands were arrested and many were interrogated and tortured  118  On 12 June 1986  four days before the ten year anniversary of the Soweto uprising  the state of emergency was extended to cover the whole country  The government amended the Public Security Act  expanding its powers to include the right to declare  unrest  areas  allowing extraordinary measures to crush protests in these areas  Severe censorship of the press became a dominant tactic in the government s strategy and television cameras were banned from entering such areas  The state broadcaster  the South African Broadcasting Corporation  SABC  provided propaganda in support of the government  Media opposition to the system increased  supported by the growth of a pro ANC underground press within South Africa  In 1987  the State of Emergency was extended for another two years  Meanwhile  about 200 000 members of the National Union of Mineworkers commenced the longest strike  three weeks  in South African history  1988 saw the banning of the activities of the UDF and other anti apartheid organisations  Much of the violence in the late 1980s and early 1990s was directed at the government  but a substantial amount was between the residents themselves  Many died in violence between members of Inkatha and the UDF ANC faction  It was later proven that the government manipulated the situation by supporting one side or the other when it suited it  Government agents assassinated opponents within South Africa and abroad  they undertook cross border army and air force attacks on suspected ANC and PAC bases  The ANC and the PAC in return exploded bombs at restaurants  shopping centres and government buildings such as magistrates courts  The state of emergency continued until 1990  when it was lifted by State President F W  de Klerk   edit  Final years of apartheid Main article  Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa This article is written like a personal reflection or essay rather than an encyclopedic description of the subject  Please help improve it by rewriting it in an encyclopedic style   September 2008   edit  Factors  edit  Institutional Racism Apartheid developed by racism of colonial factors and due to South Africa s unique industrialisation   119  The policies of industrialisation led to segregation of and classing of people  which was  specifically developed to nurture early industry such as mining and capitalist culture   119  Cheap labour was the basis of the economy and this was taken from what the state classed as peasant groups and the migrants  120  Furthermore Bonner highlight the   contradictory economic effects as the economy did not have a manufacturing sector  therefore promoting short term profitability but limiting labour productivity and the size of local markets  This also lead to its collapse as  Clarkes emphasises the economy could not provide and compete with foreign rivals as they failed to master cheap labour and complex chemistry   121   edit  Economic Contradictions Moreover the contradictions in the economy of the Apartheid state led to considerable debate among state policy  and division and conflicts in the central state  122  To a large extent the political ideology of Apartheid had emerged  from the colonisation of Africa by western states who introduced racial discrimination  enslavement and their role of  civilizing inferior natives   122  This can be seen in Christian nationalism  with its western ideology of Apartheid  123  For example  seen in  1933 when the executive of council Broederband enforced total mass segregation   123  Similarly to the economy the political factor was teemed with contradictions seen within the policies of the parties  this was further weakened when different political groups emerged  many who were against Apartheid  Leading to revolts  like the  the 1984 township revolt that quickened the breakdown of Apartheid   123   edit  Western Influence External western influence can be seen who   as one of the factors that arguably greatly influenced the other two  especially political ideology  In general colonialisation had had a massive impact on the ideas that emerged  South Africa in particular is argued to be an  unreconstructed example of western civilisation twisted by racism   124  However in contradiction as well as setting up the emergence of the foundation of Apartheid  western influence also helped end it   Once the power of the soviet union declined along with its communist Influence  western nations felt Apartheid could no longer be tolerated and spoke out  encouraging a move towards democracy and self determination   cite this quote  Again largely influencing Africa s direction  In the 1960s South Africa had economic growth second only to that of Japan  125  Trade with Western countries grew  and investment from the United States  France and Britain poured in  Resistance among blacks had been crushed  Since 1964 Mandela  leader of the African National Congress  had been in prison on Robben Island just off the coast from Cape Town  and it appeared that South Africa s security forces could handle any resistance to apartheid  citation needed  In 1974  resistance to apartheid was encouraged by Portugal s withdrawal from Mozambique and Angola  after the 1974 Carnation Revolution  South African troops withdrew from Angola in early 1976  failing to prevent the liberation forces from gaining power there  and black students in South Africa celebrated a victory of black liberation over white resistance  The Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith  signed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Harry Schwarz in 1974  enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all  Its purpose was to provide a blueprint for the government of South Africa by consent and racial peace in a multi racial society  stressing opportunity for all  consultation  the federal concept  and a Bill of Rights  It caused a split in the United Party that ultimately realigned opposition politics in South Africa  with the formation of the Progressive Federal Party in 1977  It was the first of such agreements by acknowledged black and white political leaders in South Africa  In 1978 the defence minister of the Nationalist Party  Pieter Willem Botha  became Prime Minister  Botha s all white regime was worried about the Soviet Union helping revolutionaries in South Africa  and the economy had slowed down  The new government noted that it was spending too much money trying to maintain the segregated homelands that had been created for blacks and the homelands were proving to be uneconomical  citation needed  Nor was maintaining blacks as a third class working well  The labour of blacks remained vital to the economy  and illegal black labour unions were flourishing  Many blacks remained too poor to make much of a contribution to the economy through their purchasing power   although they were more than 70 percent of the population  Botha s regime was afraid that an antidote was needed to prevent the blacks from being attracted to Communism  citation needed  In the 1980s  the anti apartheid movements in the United States and Europe were gaining support for boycotts against South Africa  for the withdrawal of U S  firms from South Africa and for the release of Mandela  South Africa was becoming an outlaw in the world community of nations  Investing in South Africa by Americans and others was coming to an end and an active policy of disinvestment ensued  The then ShellBP used to circumvent the oil embargo on the apartheid regime by buying crude oil from Nigeria and transferring the crude oil from their ship to oil tankers headed for apartheid South Africa  citation needed  This was done outside Nigeria s territorial waters  When Nigeria found out  Shell BP was nationalised  In retaliation  Margaret Thatcher s government introduced visa requirements for Nigerians visiting the United Kingdom   fact   This was in retaliation for Nigeria refusing to pay any compensation for the nationalisation  Also many South Africans attended schools in Nigeria  Nelson Mandela has himself at several times acknowledged the role of Nigeria in the struggle against apartheid   edit  Tricameral parliament In the early 1980s  Botha s National Party government started to recognise the inevitability of the need to reform apartheid  126  Early reforms were driven by a combination of internal violence  international condemnation  changes within the National Party s constituency  and changing demographics whites constituted only 16  of the total population  in comparison to 20  fifty years earlier  127  In 1983  a new constitution was passed implementing a so called Tricameral Parliament  giving coloureds and Indians voting rights and parliamentary representation in separate houses   the House of Assembly  178 members  for whites  the House of Representatives  85 members  for coloureds and the House of Delegates  45 members  for Indians  128  Each House handled laws pertaining to its racial group s  own affairs   including health  education and other community issues  129  All laws relating to  general affairs   matters such as defence  industry  taxation and Black affairs  were handled by a cabinet made up of representatives from all three houses  However  the white chamber had a large majority on this cabinet  ensuring that effective control of the country remained in white hands  130  131  Blacks  although making up the majority of the population  were excluded from representation  they remained nominal citizens of their homelands  132  The first Tricameral elections were largely boycotted by Coloured and Indian voters  amid widespread rioting  133   edit  Reforms and contact with the ANC under Botha Concerned over the popularity of Mandela  Botha denounced him as an arch Marxist committed to violent revolution  but to appease black opinion and nurture Mandela as a benevolent leader of blacks the government moved Mandela from Robben Island to a prison in a rural area just outside Cape Town  Pollsmoor prison  where prison life was easier  And the government allowed Mandela more visitors  including visits and interviews by foreigners  to let the world know that Mandela was being treated well  Black homelands were declared nation states and pass laws were abolished  Also  black labour unions were legitimised  the government recognised the right of blacks to live in urban areas permanently and gave blacks property rights there  Interest was expressed in rescinding the law against interracial marriage and also rescinding the law against sex between the races  which was under ridicule abroad  The spending for black schools increased  to one seventh of what was spent per white child  up from on one sixteenth in 1968  At the same time  attention was given to strengthening the effectiveness of the police apparatus  In January 1985  Botha addressed the government s House of Assembly and stated that the government was willing to release Mandela on condition that Mandela pledge opposition to acts of violence to further political objectives  Mandela s reply was read in public by his daughter Zinzi   his first words distributed publicly since his sentence to prison twenty one years before  Mandela described violence as the responsibility of the apartheid regime and said that with democracy there would be no need for violence  The crowd listening to the reading of his speech erupted in cheers and chants  This response helped to further elevate Mandela s status in the eyes of those  both internationally and domestically  who opposed apartheid  Between 1986 and 1988  some petty apartheid laws were repealed  Botha told white South Africans to  adapt or die  134  and twice he wavered on the eve of what were billed as  rubicon  announcements of substantial reforms  although on both occasions he backed away from substantial changes  Ironically  these reforms served only to trigger intensified political violence through the remainder of the eighties as more communities and political groups across the country joined the resistance movement  Botha s government stopped short of substantial reforms  such as lifting the ban on the ANC  PAC and SACP and other liberation organisations  releasing political prisoners  or repealing the foundation laws of grand apartheid  The government s stance was that they would not contemplate negotiating until those organisations  renounced violence   By 1987 the growth of South Africa s economy had dropped to among the lowest rate in the world  and the ban on South African participation in international sporting events was frustrating many whites in South Africa  Examples of African states with black leaders and white minorities existed in Kenya and Zimbabwe  Whispers of South Africa one day having a black President sent more hardline whites into Rightist parties  Mandela was moved to a four bedroom house of his own  with a swimming pool and shaded by fir trees  on a prison farm just outside Cape Town  He had an unpublicised meeting with Botha  Botha impressing Mandela by walking forward  extending his hand and pouring Mandela s tea  And the two had a friendly discussion  Mandela comparing the African National Congress  rebellion with that of the Afrikaner rebellion  and about everyone being brothers  A number of clandestine meetings were held between the ANC in exile and various sectors of the internal struggle  such as women and educationalists  More overtly  a group of white intellectuals met the ANC in Senegal for talks  135   edit  Presidency of F W  de Klerk de Klerk in Davos  1992  Early in 1989  Botha suffered a stroke  he was prevailed upon to resign in February 1989  136  He was succeeded as president later that year by F W  de Klerk  Despite his initial reputation as a conservative  De Klerk moved decisively towards negotiations to end the political stalemate in the country  In his opening address to parliament on 2 February 1990  De Klerk announced that he would repeal discriminatory laws and lift the 30 year ban on leading anti apartheid groups such as the African National Congress  the Pan Africanist Congress  the South African Communist Party  SACP  and the United Democratic Front  The Land Act was brought to an end  De Klerk also made his first public commitment to release jailed ANC leader Nelson Mandela  to return to press freedom and to suspend the death penalty  Media restrictions were lifted and political prisoners not guilty of common law crimes were released  On 11 February 1990  Nelson Mandela was released from Victor Verster Prison after more than 27 years in prison  Having been instructed by the UN Security Council to end its long standing involvement in South West Africa   Namibia  and in the face of military stalemate in Southern Angola  and an escalation in the size and cost of the combat with the Cubans  the Angolans  and SWAPO forces and the growing cost of the border war  South Africa negotiated a change of control of this territory  Namibia officially became an independent state on 21 March 1990   edit  Negotiations Main article  Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa Apartheid was dismantled in a series of negotiations from 1990 to 1993  culminating in elections in 1994  the first in South Africa with universal suffrage  From 1990 to 1996 the legal apparatus of apartheid was abolished  In 1990 negotiations were earnestly begun  with two meetings between the government and the ANC  The purpose of the negotiations was to pave the way for talks towards a peaceful transition of power  These meetings were successful in laying down the preconditions for negotiations   despite the considerable tensions still abounding within the country  At the first meeting  the NP and ANC discussed the conditions for negotiations to begin  The meeting was held at Groote Schuur  the President s official residence  They released the Groote Schuur Minute which said that before negotiations commenced political prisoners would be freed and all exiles allowed to return  There were fears that the change of power in South Africa would be violent  To avoid this  it was essential that a peaceful resolution between all parties be reached  In December 1991  the Convention for a Democratic South Africa  CODESA  began negotiations on the formation of a multiracial transitional government and a new constitution extending political rights to all groups  CODESA adopted a Declaration of Intent and committed itself to an  undivided South Africa   Reforms and negotiations to end apartheid led to a backlash among the right wing white opposition  leading to the Conservative Party winning a number of by elections against NP candidates  De Klerk responded by calling a whites only referendum in March 1992 to decide whether negotiations should continue  A 68 percent majority of white voters gave its support  and the victory instilled in De Klerk and the government a lot more confidence  giving the NP a stronger position in negotiations  Thus  when negotiations resumed in May 1992  under the tag of CODESA II  stronger demands were made  The ANC and the government could not reach a compromise on how power should be shared during the transition to democracy  The NP wanted to retain a strong position in a transitional government  as well as the power to change decisions made by parliament  Persistent violence added to the tension during the negotiations  This was due mostly to the intense rivalry between the Inkatha Freedom Party  IFP  and the ANC and the eruption of some traditional tribal and local rivalries between the Zulu and Xhosa historical tribal affinities  especially in the Southern Natal provinces  Although Mandela and Buthelezi met to settle their differences  they could not stem the violence  One of the worst cases of ANC IFP violence was the Boipatong massacre of 17 June 1992  when 200 IFP militants attacked the Gauteng township of Boipatong  killing 45  Witnesses said that the men had arrived in police vehicles  supporting claims that elements within the police and army contributed to the ongoing violence  Subsequent judicial inquiries found the evidence of the witnesses to be unreliable or discredited  and that there was no evidence of National Party or police involvement in the massacre  When De Klerk tried to visit the scene of the incident  he was initially warmly welcomed in the area  But he was suddenly confronted by a crowd of protesters brandishing stones and placards  The motorcade sped from the scene as police tried to hold back the crowd  Shots were fired by the police  and the PAC stated that three of its supporters had been gunned down  137  Nonetheless  the Boipatong massacre offered the ANC a pretext to engage in brinkmanship  Mandela argued that de Klerk  as head of state  was responsible for bringing an end to the bloodshed  He also accused the South African police of inciting the ANC IFP violence  This formed the basis for ANC s withdrawal from the negotiations  and the CODESA forum broke down completely at this stage  The Bisho massacre on 7 September 1992 brought matters to a head  The Ciskei Defence Force killed 29 people and injured 200 when they opened fire on ANC marchers demanding the reincorporation of the Ciskei homeland into South Africa  In the aftermath  Mandela and De Klerk agreed to meet to find ways to end the spiralling violence  This led to a resumption of negotiations  Right wing violence also added to the hostilities of this period  The assassination of Chris Hani on 10 April 1993 threatened to plunge the country into chaos  Hani  the popular general secretary of the South African Communist Party  SACP   was assassinated in 1993 in Dawn Park in Johannesburg by Janusz Walu   an anti communist Polish refugee who had close links to the white nationalist Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging  AWB   Hani enjoyed widespread support beyond his constituency in the SACP and ANC and had been recognised as a potential successor to Mandela  his death brought forth protests throughout the country and across the international community  but ultimately proved a turning point  after which the main parties pushed for a settlement with increased determination  138  On 25 June 1993  the AWB used an armoured vehicle to crash through the doors of the Kempton Park World Trade Centre where talks were still going ahead under the Negotiating Council  though this did not derail the process  139  In addition to the continuing  black on black  violence  there were a number of attacks on white civilians by the PAC s military wing  the Azanian People s Liberation Army  APLA   The PAC was hoping to strengthen their standing by attracting the support of the angry  impatient youth  In the St James Church massacre on 25 July 1993  members of the APLA opened fire in a church in Cape Town  killing 11 members of the congregation and wounding 58  In 1993  de Klerk and Mandela were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize  for their work for the peaceful termination of the apartheid regime  and for laying the foundations for a new democratic South Africa   140  Violence persisted right up to the 1994 elections  Lucas Mangope  leader of the Bophuthatswana homeland  declared that it would not take part in the elections  It had been decided that  once the temporary constitution had come into effect  the homelands would be incorporated into South Africa  but Mangope did not want this to happen  There were strong protests against his decision  leading to a coup d  tat in Bophuthatswana on 10 March which deposed Mangope  despite the intervention of white right wingers hoping to maintain him in power  Three AWB militants were killed during this intervention  and harrowing images were shown on national television and in newspapers across the world  Two days before the elections  a car bomb exploded in Johannesburg  killing nine  141  142  The day before the elections  another one went off  injuring thirteen  Finally  though  at midnight on 26 27 April 1994  the old flag was lowered  and the old  now co official  national anthem Die Stem   The Call   was sung  followed by the raising of the new rainbow flag and singing of the other co official anthem  Nkosi Sikelel  iAfrika   God Bless Africa     edit  1994 election Main article  South African general election  1994 The election was held on 27 April 1994 and went off peacefully throughout the country as 20 000 000 South Africans cast their votes  There was some difficulty in organising the voting in rural areas  but  throughout the country  people waited patiently for many hours in order to vote amidst a palpable feeling of goodwill  An extra day was added to give everyone the chance  International observers agreed that the elections were free and fair  143  However  this view has been challenged  There were widespread irregularities  ignored by the international observers  The European Union s report on the election compiled at the end of May 1994  but only published two years after the election  criticised the Independent Electoral Commission s lack of preparedness for the polls  the shortages of voting materials at many voting stations  and the absence of effective safeguards against fraud in the counting process  In particular  it expressed disquiet that  no international observers had been allowed to be present at the crucial stage of the count when party representatives negotiated over disputed ballots   This meant that both the electorate and the world were  simply left to guess at the way the final result was achieved   144  The ANC won 62 65  of the vote  145  146  less than the 66 7  that would have allowed it to rewrite the constitution  In the new parliament  252 of its 400 seats went to members of the African National Congress  The NP captured most of the white and coloured votes and became the official opposition party  As well as deciding the national government  the election decided the provincial governments  and the ANC won in seven of the nine provinces  with the NP winning in the Western Cape and the IFP in KwaZulu Natal  On 10 May 1994  Mandela was sworn in as South Africa s president  The Government of National Unity was established  its cabinet made up of twelve ANC representatives  six from the NP  and three from the IFP  Thabo Mbeki and Frederik Willem de Klerk were made deputy presidents  The anniversary of the elections  27 April  is celebrated as a public holiday in South Africa known as Freedom Day   edit  Contrition The following individuals  who had previously supported apartheid  made public apologies  FW de Klerk    I apologise in my capacity as leader of the NP to the millions who suffered wrenching disruption of forced removals  who suffered the shame of being arrested for pass law offences  who over the decades suffered the indignities and humiliation of racial discrimination   147  Marthinus van Schalkwyk 148  The National party brought development to a section of South Africa  but also brought suffering through a system grounded on injustice   in a statement shortly after the National Party chose to disband its party  verification needed  Adriaan Vlok   who washed the feet of apartheid victim Frank Chikane in an act of apology for the wrongs of the Apartheid regime  149  Leon Wessels   who said  I am now more convinced than ever that apartheid was a terrible mistake that blighted our land  South Africans did not listen to the laughing and
