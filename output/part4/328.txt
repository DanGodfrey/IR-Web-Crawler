Representations of Hitler during his lifetime Numerous works in popular music and literature feature Adolf Hitler prominently  Inside Germany  Hitler was usually depicted as a god like figure  loved and respected by the German people  as  for example  in Triumph of the Will  which Hitler co produced  An exception was the German movie Das Testament des Dr  Mabuse  The Testament of Dr  Mabuse    1933   which was banned by the Nazi propaganda ministry  Many critics consider Fritz Lang s depiction of a homicidal maniac masterminding a criminal empire from within the walls of a criminal asylum to be an allegory of the Nazi ascent to power in Germany  1  Another early example of a cryptic depiction is in Bertolt Brecht s 1941 play  The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui  in which Hitler  in the persona of the principal character Arturo Ui  2  a Chicago racketeer in the cauliflower trade  is ruthlessly satirised  Brecht  who was German but left when the Nazis came to power  also expressed his opposition to the National Socialist and Fascist movements in other of his most famous plays  Charlie Chaplin from the film The Great Dictator  1940 Outside Germany  Hitler was made fun of or depicted as a maniac  There are many notable examples in contemporary Hollywood films  Several Three Stooges shorts  the first being You Nazty Spy  1940   the very first Hollywood work lampooning Hitler and the Nazis in which the boys  with Moe Howard portraying  Moe Hailstone   as the Hitler character  are made dictators of the fictional country Moronica  This short in particular implies that business interests were behind Hitler s rise to power  and was said to be Moe Howard s favorite Stooges short subject  A sequel was released a year later entitled I ll Never Heil Again  This one illustrated the disagreements between Hitler and the League of Nations  In other Three Stooges shorts  Hitler is referred to as  Schicklgruber  in reference to his father Alois Hitler s birth name  Charlie Chaplin made fun of Hitler as  Adenoid Hynkel   the world domination obsessed anti semite dictator of Tomainia in his 1940 movie The Great Dictator  who is played by Charlie Chaplin  This is one of the most recognizable Hitler parodies  Especially during World War II  Hitler was caricatured in numerous animated shorts  including Der Fuehrer s Face  a 1943 Disney wartime propaganda cartoon featuring Donald Duck  and Herr Meets Hare with Bugs Bunny  However  Hitler s first appearance on a Warner Brothers cartoon was in Bosko s Picture Show in 1932 in a short gag where Hitler is shown chasing after Jimmy Durante with an ax  George Grosz painted Cain  or Hitler in Hell  1944  showing the dead attacking Hitler in Hell  The photomontage artist John Heartfield made frequent use of Hitler s image as a target for his brand of barbed satire during Hitler s lifetime  In Fritz Lang s 1941 movie Man Hunt  which opened in theaters before America s entry into the war  Hitler is seen in the scope of a British hunter s rifle  In Ernst Lubitsch s 1942 movie To Be or Not to Be  as well as in Mel Brooks  remake in 1983   an actor from a Polish stage group impersonates Hitler to enable the escape of the troupe to England  In the opening scenes of Citizen Kane  1941   Charles Foster Kane is described and shown as supporting  then denouncing Hitler  Apart from Hollywood films  Hitler was the subject for several comic book superheroes who battled Hitler directly or indirectly in comics published during World War II  Superheroes that fought Hitler include Superman  Captain America  The Shield  and Namor the Sub Mariner  The first Captain America comic showed Captain America hitting Hitler on the jaw  Captain America s archenemy  Red Skull  was established as being an apprentice to Hitler himself  In Superman vol 1  15 the dictator Razan appeared  who attempted to invade a nearby democratic nation  Superman defeated his army  and Razan was shot while tryng to escape  Hitler was mocked in satirical folk songs such as  Stalin Wasn t Stallin   or when new lyrics were created to old songs such as  Hitler Has Only Got One Ball   to the tune of the  Colonel Bogey March     edit  Representations of Hitler after his death After his death  Hitler continued to be depicted as incompetent or foolish  However  while Hitler s anti Semitic policies were well known during his lifetime  it was only after his death that the full extent of the Holocaust and other Nazi genocides became known  3   This  coupled with Hitler no longer being a threat  has meant that the way he is depicted in popular culture has resulted in Hitler being considered evil personified  The 2003 television film Hitler  The Rise of Evil stars Robert Carlyle in the title role and depicts a semi fictional account of Hitler s life from childhood to the new position of F hrer und Reichskanzler  completing his ascension to full totalitarian  dictatorial power in Germany  Moloch  1999   directed by Alexander Sokurov  starring Leonid Mozgovoy  deals with Hitler s life on his Berghof mountain retreat near Berchtesgaden during the war  drawing heavily from Hitler s Table Talk published after the war  Hitler s last days have been depicted in several films  first in Der letzte Akt  1955   directed by Georg Wilhelm Pabst  starring Albin Skoda as the dictator  next was the fifth and final installment of the Soviet film series Liberation  1969 72   directed by Yuri Ozerov  starring Fritz Diez  an actor who commonly portrayed Hitler in a number of East German films from 1955 onwards   The Death of Adolf Hitler  a British  7 January 1973  made for television production  starring Frank Finlay in the title role  and Hitler  The Last Ten Days  1973   directed by Ennio de Concini  starring Sir Alec Guinness were the first Western contributions  The fifth iteration was the U S  television film The Bunker  1981   directed by George Schaefer  starring Sir Anthony Hopkins  Finally  there was the Academy Award nominated Downfall  2004   directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel and starring Bruno Ganz as Hitler  Similarly depicting Hitler s final hour in the bunker  short film Hundert Jahre Adolf Hitler   Die letzte Stunde im F hrerbunker  1989   directed by Christoph Schlingensief  starring Udo Kier  cannot be considered a remake of the above films in the proper sense  Another example of Hitler representations are comedy films such as Mel Brooks  comedy The Producers featured a satirical play within a play called Springtime for Hitler  featuring dancing Nazis and songs about the conquest of Europe  Brooks  later comedy  History of the World  Part I  featured  Hitler on Ice   Hitler was also portrayed in the film Valkyrie by David Bamber  which tells the story of the July 1944 bomb attempt on his life  Hitler has also been portrayed in experimental films  Hitler  A Film from Germany  1978   a 4 part  442 minute experimental film on Hitler  directed by Hans J rgen Syberberg  starring Heinz Schubert  A similar non linear approach to Syberberg s  likening Hitler to a movie director as well  was used in the film The Empty Mirror  1996   directed by Barry J

of secret agents  He is captured alive  taken to Moscow  and kept in a cage beneath the Kremlin for Joseph Stalin s amusement  Shortly after Stalin s death  Hitler is executed  A similar approach is taken by Ira Levin in The Boys from Brazil  where it is revealed that Hitler conspired with Josef Mengele to clone himself prior to his death  Using Hitler s blood  Mengele begins a project in the 1960s to clone several Hitlers and distribute the Hitler infants to families similar to that of the original  Mengele later attempts to recreate the sociological environment of Hitler s youth
