region of Northern Europe  It is bordered by Sweden in the west  Norway in the north and Russia in the east  while Estonia lies to its south across the Gulf of Finland  Around 5 4 million people reside in Finland  with the majority concentrated in the southern region  6  It is the eighth largest country in Europe in terms of area and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union  Finland is a parliamentary republic with a central government based in Helsinki and local governments in 336 municipalities  7  8  and a federacy with  land  A total of about one million residents

stones  There is one in the Swedish province Uppland  with the inscription finlonti  U 582  and one in Gotland  in the Baltic Sea  with the inscription finlandi  G 319   the latter dating from the 13th century  15  Astuvansalmi rock paintings at Saimaa  the oldest dating from 3000 2500 BCE   edit  Suomi The name Suomi  Finnish for  Finland   has uncertain origins  but a candidate for a cognate is the Proto Baltic word  zeme  meaning  land   In addition to the close relatives of Finnish  the Finnic languages   this name is also used in the Baltic languages Latvian and Lithuanian  Alternatively  the Indo European word  g m on  man   cf  Gothic guma  Latin homo  has been suggested  being borrowed as   oma  The word originally referred only to the province of Finland Proper  and later to the northern coast of Gulf of Finland  with northern lands such as Ostrobothnia still being excluded as late as the 18th century  Earlier theories suggested derivation from suomaa  fen land  or suoniemi  fen cape   and parallels between saame  Sami  a non Finnish people in Finland  and H me  a Finnish people and a province  were drawn  but these theories are now considered outdated  16   edit  History Main article  History of Finland  edit  Prehistory Main article  History of Finland Prehistory According to archaeological evidence  the area now comprising Finland was settled at the latest around 8500 BCE during the Stone Age as the ice sheet of the last ice age receded  The artifacts the first settlers left behind present characteristics that are shared with those found in Estonia  Russia and Norway  17  The earliest people were hunter gatherers  using stone tools  18  The first pottery appeared in 5200 BCE when the Comb Ceramic culture was introduced  19  The arrival of the Corded Ware culture in southern coastal Finland between 3000 2500 BCE may have coincided with the start of agriculture  20  Even with the introduction of agriculture  hunting and fishing continued to be important parts of the subsistence economy  The Bronze Age  1500 500 BCE  and Iron Age  500 BCE 1200 CE  were characterised by extensive contacts with other cultures in the Fennoscandian and Baltic regions  There is no consensus on when Uralic languages and Indo European languages were first spoken in the area of contemporary Finland  During the 1st millennium AD early Finnish was spoken at least in agricultural settlements of Southern Finland  whereas S mi speaking populations occupied most parts of the country  citation needed   edit  Swedish era File Swedish

shades of green stand for different dominions and possessions  Swedish kings established their rule in the Northern Crusades from the 12th century until 1249  21  The area of present day Finland became a fully consolidated part of the Swedish kingdom  Swedish speaking settlers arrived at the coastal regions during the medieval time  Swedish became the dominant language of the nobility  administration and education  Finnish was chiefly a language for the peasantry  clergy and local courts in predominantly Finnish speaking areas  During the Protestant Reformation  the Finns gradually converted to Lutheranism  22  In the 16th century  Mikael Agricola published the first written works in Finnish  The first university in Finland  The Royal Academy of Turku  was established in 1640  Finland suffered a severe famine in 1696 97  during which about one third of the Finnish population died  23  In the 18th century  wars between Sweden and Russia led to the occupation of Finland twice by Russian forces  wars known to the Finns as the Greater Wrath  1714 21  and the Lesser Wrath  1742 43   23  By this time Finland was the predominant term for the whole area from the Gulf of Bothnia to the Russian border   edit  Russian Empire era Main article  Grand Duchy of Finland See also  Finland s language strife and Russification of Finland On 29 March 1809  having been taken over by the armies of Alexander I of Russia in the Finnish War  Finland became an autonomous Grand Duchy in the Russian Empire until the end of 1917  In 1811 Alexander I incorporated Russian Vyborg province into Grand Duchy of Finland  During the Russian era  the Finnish language began to gain recognition  From the 1860s onwards  a strong Finnish nationalist movement known as the Fennoman movement grew  Milestones included the publication of what would become Finland s national epic the Kalevala in 1835  and the Finnish language s achieving equal legal status with Swedish in 1892  The Finnish famine of 1866 68 killed 15  of the population  making it one of the worst famines in European history  The famine led the Russian Empire to ease financial regulations  and investment rose in following decades  Economic and political development was rapid  24  The GDP per capita was still half of that of the United States and a third of that of Britain  24  In 1906  universal suffrage was adopted in the Grand Duchy of Finland  However  the relationship between the Grand Duchy and the Russian Empire soured when the Russian government made moves to restrict Finnish autonomy  For example  the universal suffrage was  in practice  virtually meaningless  since the tsar did not have to approve any of the laws adopted by the Finnish parliament  Desire for independence gained ground  first among radical liberals 25  and socialists   edit  Civil war and early independence Main articles  Finnish Declaration of Independence and Finnish Civil War Soviet approval of Finland s independence in Russian  After the 1917 February Revolution  the position of Finland as part of the Russian Empire was questioned  mainly by Social Democrats  Since the head of state was the Czar of Russia  it was not clear who the chief executive of Finland was after the revolution  The parliament  controlled by social democrats  passed the so called Power Law  which would give the highest authority to the parliament  This was rejected by the Russian Provisional Government and by the right wing parties in Finland  The Provisional Government dissolved the parliament by force  which the social democrats considered illegal  since the right to do so was stripped from the Russians by the Power Law  citation needed  New elections were conducted  in which right wing parties won a slim majority  Some social democrats refused to accept the result and still claimed that the dissolution of the parliament  and thus the ensuing elections  were extralegal  The two nearly equally powerful political blocs  the right wing parties and the social democratic party  were highly antagonized  citation needed  The October Revolution in Russia changed the game anew  Suddenly  the right wing parties in Finland started to reconsider their decision to block the transfer of highest executive power from the Russian government to Finland  as radical communists took power in Russia  Rather than acknowledge the authority of the Power Law of a few months earlier  the right wing government declared independence on 6 December 1917  On 27 January 1918  the official opening shots of the war were fired in two simultaneous events  The government started to disarm the Russian forces in Pohjanmaa  and the Social Democratic Party staged a coup  not in citation given  The latter succeeded in controlling southern Finland and Helsinki  but the white government continued in exile from Vaasa  This sparked the brief but bitter civil war  The Whites  who were supported by Imperial Germany  prevailed over the Reds  26  After the war  tens of thousands of Reds and suspected sympathizers were interned in camps  where thousands died by execution or from malnutrition and disease  Deep social and political enmity was sown between the Reds and Whites and would last until the Winter War and beyond  The civil war and activist expeditions to the Soviet Union strained Eastern relations  After a brief flirtation with monarchy  Finland became a presidential republic  with Kaarlo Juho St hlberg elected as its first president in 1919  The Finnish Russian border was determined by the Treaty of Tartu in 1920  largely following the historic border but granting Pechenga  Finnish  Petsamo  and its Barents Sea harbour to Finland  Finnish democracy did not see any Soviet coup attempts and survived the anti Communist Lapua Movement  The relationship between Finland and the Soviet Union was tense  Germany s relations with democratic Finland cooled also after the Nazis  rise to power  citation needed  Military was trained in France instead  and relations to Western Europe and Sweden were strengthened  In 1917 the population was 3 million  Credit based land reform was enacted after the civil war  increasing the proportion of capital owning population  24  About 70  of workers were occupied in agriculture and 10  in industry  27  The largest export markets were the United Kingdom and Germany   edit  World War II Main article  Military history of Finland during World War II Areas ceded by Finland to the Soviet Union after the Winter War in 1940 and the Continuation War in 1944  The Porkkala land lease was returned to Finland in 1956  Finland covered an area of approximately 385 000 km2  149 000 sq mi  before the handover  During World War II  Finland fought the Soviet Union twice  in the Winter War of 1939 40 after the Soviet Union had attacked Finland  and in the Continuation War of 1941 44  following Operation Barbarossa  in which Germany invaded the Soviet Union  For 872 days  the German army besieged Leningrad  the Soviet Union s second largest city  28  The siege of Leningrad resulted in the deaths of some one million of the city s inhabitants  29  Finnish troops controlled some of the areas around the city but refused to attack or let Germans use those areas for attack  whether they should be said to have helped in the siege or refused to help is controversial  After fighting a major Soviet offensive in June July 1944 to a standstill  Finland reached an armistice with the Soviet Union  This was followed by the Lapland War of 1944 45  when Finland forced the Germans out of northern Finland  The treaties signed in 1947 and 1948 with the Soviet Union included Finnish obligations  restraints and reparations as well as further Finnish territorial concessions begun in the Moscow Peace Treaty of 1940  As a result of the two wars  Finland was forced to cede most of Finnish Karelia  Salla and Petsamo  which amounted to ten percent of its land area and twenty percent of its industrial capacity  including the ports of Vyborg  Viipuri  and ice free Liinakhamari  Liinahamari   Almost the whole population  some 400 000 persons  fled these areas  Finland was never occupied by Soviet forces and retained its independence  however at a loss of about 93 000 soldiers killed  by proportion the third highest loss rate in World War II  citation needed  Finland rejected Marshall aid  in apparent deference to Soviet desires  However  the United States provided secret development aid and helped the still non communist Social Democratic Party in hopes of preserving Finland s independence  30  Establishing trade with the Western powers  such as the United Kingdom  and the reparations to the Soviet Union caused Finland to transform itself from a primarily agrarian economy to an industrialised one  For example  the Valmet corporation was founded to create materials for war reparations  Even after the reparations had been paid off  Finland poor in certain resources necessary for an industrialized nation  such as iron and oil  continued to trade with the Soviet Union in the framework of bilateral trade  citation needed   edit  Cold War In 1950 half of the Finnish workers were occupied in agriculture and a third lived in urban areas  31  The new jobs in manufacturing  services and trade quickly attracted people to the towns  The average number of births per woman declined from a baby boom peak of 3 5 in 1947 to 1 5 in 1973  31  When baby boomers entered the workforce  the economy did not generate jobs fast enough  and hundreds of thousands emigrated to the more industrialized Sweden  with emigration peaking in 1969 and 1970  31  The 1952 Summer Olympics brought international visitors  Finland took part in trade liberalization in the World Bank  the International Monetary Fund and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  Urho Kekkonen  8th president of Finland Officially claiming to be neutral  Finland lay in the grey zone between the Western countries and the Soviet Union  The YYA Treaty  Finno Soviet Pact of Friendship  Cooperation and Mutual Assistance  gave the Soviet Union some leverage in Finnish domestic politics  This was extensively exploited by president Urho Kekkonen against his opponents  He maintained an effective monopoly on Soviet relations from 1956 on  which was crucial for his continued popularity  In politics  there was a tendency of avoiding any policies and statements that could be interpreted as anti Soviet  This phenomenon was given the name  Finlandization  by the German press  Despite close relations with the Soviet Union  Finland remained a Western European market economy  Various industries benefited from trade privileges with the Soviets  which explains the widespread support that pro Soviet policies enjoyed among business interests in Finland  Economic growth was rapid in the postwar era  and by 1975 Finland s GDP per capita was the 15th highest in the world  citation needed  In the 1970s and 1980s  Finland built one of the most extensive welfare states in the world  Finland also negotiated with the EEC  a predecessor of the European Union  a treaty that mostly abolished customs duties towards the EEC starting from 1977  although Finland did not fully join  In 1981  president Urho Kekkonen s failing health forced him to retire after holding office for 25 years  citation needed  Miscalculated macroeconomic decisions  a banking crisis  the collapse of its primary trading partner  the Soviet Union  and a global economic downturn caused a deep recession in Finland in the early 1990s  The depression bottomed out in 1993  and Finland saw steady economic growth for more than ten years  citation needed   edit  Recent history In 2002 Finland introduced the currency of the eurozone  the euro  Like other Nordic countries  Finland has liberalized its economy since the late 1980s  Financial and product market regulation was loosened  Some state enterprises have been privatized and there have been some modest tax cuts  Finland joined the European Union in 1995  and the Eurozone in 1999  The population is aging with the birth rate at 10 42 births per 1 000 population  or a fertility rate of 1 8  31  With a median age of 41 6 years  Finland is one of the oldest countries  32  dead link  half of voters are estimated to be over 50 years old  Like most European countries  without further reforms or much higher immigration  Finland is expected to struggle with demographics  even though macroeconomic projections are healthier than in most other developed countries  The Finnish markka was replaced by the euro in 2002  As a preparation for this date  the minting of the new euro coins started as early as 1999  this is why the first euro coins from Finland have the year 1999 on them  instead of 2002 like some of the other countries of the Eurozone  Three different designs  one for  2 coin  one for  1 coin and one for the other six coins  were selected for the Finnish coins  In 2007  in order to adopt the new common map like the rest of the Eurozone countries  Finland changed the common side of its coins   edit  Geography

more to the north than Helsinki  The distance from the southernmost Hanko to the northernmost point in the country Nuorgam is 1 160 kilometres  720 mi   Finland is a country of thousands of lakes and islands 187 888 lakes  larger than 500 m2 0 12 acre  and 179 584 islands  33  Its largest lake  Saimaa  is the fourth largest in Europe  The greatest number of islands are to be found in the southwest in the Turku archipelago  Further from the coast lies Ahvenanmaa or  land  in Swedish  Islands  Much of the geography of Finland is explained by the Ice Age  The glaciers were thicker and lasted longer in Fennoscandia compared to the rest of Europe  Their eroding effects have left the Finnish landscape mostly flat with few hills and fewer mountains  Its highest point  the Halti at 1 324 metres  4 344 ft   is found in the extreme north of Lapland at the border between Finland and Norway  The highest mountain whose peak is entirely in Finland is Ridnitsohkka at 1 316 m  4 318 ft   directly adjacent to Halti  The retreating glaciers have left the land with morainic deposits in formations of eskers  These are ridges of stratified gravel and sand  running northwest to southeast  where the ancient edge of the glacier once lay  Among the biggest of these are the three Salpausselk  ridges that run across southern Finland  Due to having been compressed under the enormous weight of the glaciers  terrain in Finland is rising due to the post glacial rebound  The effect is strongest around the Gulf of Bothnia  where land steadily rises about 1 cm a year  As a result  the old sea bottom turns little by little into dry land  the surface area of the country is expanding by about 7 square kilometres  2 7 sq mi  annually  34  In a sense  Finland is rising from the sea  35  Forest covers 86  of the country s area  36  the largest forested area in Europe  The forest consists of pine  spruce  birch and other species  Finland is the largest producer of wood in Europe and among the largest in the world  The landscape is covered mostly  seventy five percent of land area  by coniferous taiga forests and fens  with little arable land  The most common type of rock is granite  It is a ubiquitous part of the scenery  visible wherever there is no soil cover  Moraine or till is the most common type of soil  covered by a thin layer of humus of biological origin  Podzol profile development is seen in most forest soils except where drainage is poor  Gleysols and peat bogs occupy poorly drained areas  The Whooper Swan  national bird of Finland  edit  Biodiversity Main article  Fauna of Finland Phytogeographically  Finland is shared between the Arctic  central European and northern European provinces of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom  According to the WWF  the territory of Finland can be subdivided into three ecoregions  the Scandinavian and Russian taiga  Sarmatic mixed forests and Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands  The brown bear  Ursus arctos  is the national animal of Finland Similarly  Finland has a diverse and extensive range of fauna  There are at least sixty native mammalian species  248 breeding bird species  over seventy fish species and eleven reptile and frog species present today  many migrating from neighboring countries thousands of years ago  citation needed  Large and widely recognized wildlife mammals found in Finland are the brown bear  the national animal   gray wolf  wolverine and elk  moose   Three of the more striking birds are the Whooper Swan  a large European swan and the national bird of Finland  the Capercaillie  a large  black plumaged member of the grouse family  and the European Eagle owl  The latter is considered an indicator of old growth forest connectivity  and has been declining because of landscape fragmentation  37  The most common breeding birds are the willow warbler  chaffinch and redwing  38  Of some seventy species of freshwater fish  the northern pike  perch and others are plentiful  Atlantic salmon remains the favorite of fly rod enthusiasts  The endangered Saimaa Ringed Seal  one of only three lake seal species in the world  exists only in the Saimaa lake

the southern Finland last 4 months  from mid May to mid September   In northern Finland  particularly in Lapland  a subarctic climate dominates  characterized by cold occasionally severe winters and relatively warm  short summers  Winters in north Finland are nearly 7 months long  and snow covers the lands almost 6 months  from October to early May  Summers in the north are quite short  only two to three months  citation needed  The main factor influencing Finland s climate is the country s geographical position between the 60th and 70th northern parallels in the Eurasian continent s coastal zone  which shows characteristics of both a maritime and a continental climate  depending on the direction of air flow  Finland is near enough to the Atlantic Ocean to be continuously warmed by the Gulf Stream  which explains the unusually warm climate considering the absolute latitude  40  The Finnish climate is suitable for grain farming in the southernmost regions but not farther north  42  A quarter of Finland s territory lies within the Arctic Circle and the midnight sun can be experienced for more days the farther north one travels  At Finland s northernmost point  the sun does not set for 73 consecutive days during summer  and does not rise at all for 51 days during winter  Lake Pielinen seen from a hill in Koli National Park   edit  Administrative divisions Main articles

have enjoyed approximately equal support  and their combined vote has totalled about 65 80  of all votes  For a few decades after 1944  the Communists were a strong fourth party  Thanks to the electoral system of proportional representation  and the relative reluctance of voters to switch their support between parties  the relative strengths of the parties have commonly varied only slightly from one election to another  However  there have been some long term trends  such as the rise and fall of the Communists during the Cold War  the decline of the Liberal party since it was founded in 1965  and the rise of the Green party and its predecessor since 1983  In the 2011 elections  the True Finns achieved exceptional success  increasing its representation from 5 to 39 seats  and thus

the late 1980s  Finland had one of the world s most extensive welfare systems  one that guaranteed decent living conditions for all Finns  Since then social security has been cut back  but still the system is one of the most comprehensive in the world  citation needed  Created almost entirely during the first three decades after World War II  the social security system was an outgrowth of the traditional Nordic belief that the state was not inherently hostile to the well being of its citizens  but could intervene benevolently on their behalf  According to some social historians  the basis of this belief was a relatively benign history that had allowed the gradual emergence of a free and independent peasantry in the Nordic countries and had curtailed the dominance of the nobility and the subsequent formation of a powerful right wing  Finland s history has been harsher than the histories of the other Nordic countries  but not harsh enough to bar the country from following their path of social development  54   edit  Military Main articles  Finnish Defence Forces and Military history of Finland See also  List of wars involving Finland FNS  Hanko  Hamina Class fast attack

particular challenge  The country lies between 60  and 70  north latitude  and has severe winters and relatively short growing seasons that are sometimes interrupted by frosts  However  because the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Drift Current moderate the climate  Finland contains half of the world s arable land north of 60  north latitude  Annual precipitation is usually sufficient  but it occurs almost exclusively during the winter months  making summer droughts a constant threat  In response to the climate  farmers have relied on quick ripening and frost resistant varieties of crops  and they have cultivated south facing slopes as well as richer bottomlands to ensure production even in years with summer frosts  Most farmland had originally been either forest or swamp  and the soil had usually required treatment with lime and years of cultivation to neutralize excess acid and to develop fertility  Irrigation was generally not necessary  but drainage systems were often needed to remove excess water  Finland s agriculture was efficient and productive at least when compared with farming in other European countries  54  Aleksanterinkatu  a commercial street in Helsinki Forests play a key role in the country s economy  making it one of the world s leading wood producers and providing raw materials at competitive prices for the crucial wood processing industries  As in

edit  Industry Main article  Economy of Finland Finland was rapidly industrialized after the Second World War  achieving GDP per capita levels equal to that of Japan or the UK in the beginning of

is 82 years for women and 75 years for men  111  There are 307 residents for each doctor  112  About 18 9  of health care is funded directly by households and 76 6  by taxation  A recent study by The Lancet medical journal found that Finland has the lowest stillbirth rate out of 193 countries  including UK  France and New Zealand  113  114   edit  Society Finnish family life is centred on the nuclear family  Relations with the extended family are often rather distant  and Finnish people do not form politically significant clans  tribes or similar structures  According to UNICEF  Finland ranks fourth in the world in child well being  115  After examining the position of women around the world  the Washington based Population Crisis Committee reported in 1988 that Finland  slightly behind top ranked Sweden and just ahead of the United States  was one of the best places in which a woman could live  The group reached this conclusion after examining the health  educational  economic  and legal conditions that affect women s lives  Finnish women were the first in Europe to gain the franchise  and by the 1980s they routinely constituted about one third of the membership of the Eduskunta  parliament  and held several ministerial posts  In the 1980s  about 75 percent of adult women worked outside the home  they made up about 48 percent of the work force  Finnish women were as well educated as their male counterparts  and  in some cases  the number of women studying at the university level  for example  were slightly ahead of the number of men  In addition to an expanding welfare system  which since World War II had come to provide them with substantial assistance in the area of childbearing and child rearing  women had made notable legislative gains that brought them closer to full equality with men  54  In a number of areas  however  the country s small feminist movement maintained that the circumstances in which Finnish women lived needed to be improved  Most striking was the disparity in wages  Although women made up just under half the work force and had a tradition of working outside the home  they earned only about two thirds of the wages paid to men  54  The Equality Law that went into effect in 1987 committed the country to achieving full equality for women  In the late 1980s  there was a timetable listing specific goals to be achieved during the remainder of the twentieth century  The emphasis was to be equality for everyone  rather than protection for women  Efforts were undertaken not only to place women in occupations dominated by males  but also to bring males into fields traditionally believed to belong to the women s sphere  such as child care and elementary school teaching  Another aim was for women to occupy a more equal share of decision making positions  54  In 1906  Finland was the first nation in the world to give full suffrage  the right to vote and to run for office  to all citizens  including women

municipal level  Even though many or most schools were started as private schools  today only around 3  students are enrolled in private schools  mostly Helsinki based schools such as SYK   many times less than in Sweden and most other developed countries  116  Pre school education is rare compared to other EU countries  Formal education is usually started at the age of 7  The primary school takes normally 6 years  the lower secondary school 3 years  and most schools are managed by municipal officials  The flexible curriculum is set by the Ministry of Education and the Education Board  Education is compulsory between the ages of 7 and 16  After lower secondary school  graduates may either enter the workforce directly  or apply to trade schools or gymnasiums  upper secondary schools   Trade schools prepare for professions  Academically oriented gymnasiums have higher entrance requirements and specifically prepare for Abitur and tertiary education  Graduation from either formally qualifies for tertiary education  In tertiary education  two mostly separate and non interoperating sectors are found  the profession oriented polytechnics and the research oriented universities  Education is free and living expenses are to a large extent financed by the government through student benefits  There are 20 universities and 30 polytechnics in the country  Helsinki University is ranked 75th in the Top University Ranking of 2010  117  The World Economic Forum ranks Finland s tertiary education  2 in the world  118  Around 33  of residents have a tertiary degree  similar to

in OECD  while in advanced programs it is 7 3   still below OECD average 16 5   120  More than 30  of tertiary graduates are in science related fields  Forest improvement  materials research  environmental sciences  neural networks  low temperature physics  brain research  biotechnology  genetic technology and communications showcase fields of study where Finnish researchers have had a significant impact  121  Finland had a long tradition of adult education  and by the 1980s nearly one million Finns were receiving some kind of instruction each year  Forty percent of them did so for professional reasons  Adult education appeared in a number of forms  such as secondary evening schools  civic and workers  institutes  study centres  vocational course centres  and folk high schools  Study centres allowed groups to follow study plans of their own making  with educational and financial assistance provided by the state  Folk high schools are a distinctly Nordic institution  Originating in Denmark in the nineteenth century  folk high schools became common throughout the region  Adults of all ages could stay at them for several weeks and take courses in subjects that ranged from handicrafts to economics  54  Finland is highly productive in scientific research  In 2005  Finland had the fourth most scientific publications per capita of the OECD countries  122  In 2007  1 801 patents were filed in Finland  123   edit  Literature Main article  Finnish literature Though Finnish written language could be said to exist since Mikael Agricola translated the New Testament into Finnish in the sixteenth century as a result of the Protestant Reformation  few notable works of literature were written until the nineteenth century  which saw the beginning of a Finnish national Romantic Movement  This prompted Elias L nnrot to collect Finnish and Karelian folk poetry and arrange and publish them as Kalevala  the Finnish national epic  The era saw a rise of poets and novelists who wrote in Finnish  notably Aleksis Kivi and Eino Leino  Many writers of the national awakening wrote in Swedish  such as the national poet Johan Ludvig Runeberg and Zachris Topelius  After Finland became independent there was a rise of modernist writers  most famously Finnish speaking Mika Waltari and Swedish speaking Edith S dergran  Frans Eemil Sillanp   was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1939  The second World War prompted a return to more national interests in comparison to a more international line of thought  characterized by V in  Linna  Besides Kalevala and Waltari Swedish speaking Tove Jansson is the most translated Finnish writer  Literature in modern Finland is in a healthy state  Popular modern writers include Arto Paasilinna  Ilkka Remes  Kari Hotakainen  Sofi Oksanen and Jari Tervo  while the best novel is annually awarded the prestigious Finlandia Prize   edit  Visual arts See also  List of Finnish architects The National

significant figure in the history of classical music  Much of the music of Finland is influenced by traditional Karelian melodies and lyrics  as comprised in the Kalevala  Karelian culture is perceived as the purest expression of the Finnic myths and beliefs  less influenced by Germanic influence than the Nordic folk dance music that largely replaced the kalevaic tradition  Finnish folk music has undergone a roots revival in recent decades  and has become a part of popular music  The people of northern Finland  Sweden and Norway  the Sami  are known primarily for highly spiritual songs called Joik  The same word sometimes refers to lavlu or vuelie songs  though this is technically incorrect  The first Finnish opera was written by the German born composer Fredrik Pacius in 1852  Pacius also wrote the music to the poem Maamme V rt land  Our Country   Finland s national anthem  In the 1890s Finnish nationalism based on the Kalevala spread  and Jean Sibelius became famous for his vocal symphony Kullervo  He soon received a grant to study runo singers in Karelia and continued his rise as the first prominent Finnish musician  In 1899 he composed Finlandia  which played its important role in Finland gaining independence  He remains one of Finland s most popular national figures and is a symbol of the nation  Today  Finland has a very lively classical music scene  Finnish classical music has only existed for about a hundred years  and many of Finland s important composers are still alive  such as Magnus Lindberg  Kaija Saariaho  Aulis Sallinen and Einojuhani Rautavaara  The composers are accompanied with a large number of great conductors such as Esa Pekka Salonen  Osmo V nsk   Jukka Pekka Saraste and Leif Segerstam  Some of the internationally acclaimed Finnish classical musicians are Karita Mattila  Soile Isokoski  Pekka Kuusisto  Olli Mustonen  Perttu Kivilaakso of Apocalyptica playing metal music live  Iskelm   coined directly from the German word Schlager  meaning hit  is a traditional Finnish word for a light popular song  Finnish popular music also includes various kinds of dance music  tango  a style of Argentine music  is also popular  The light music in Swedish speaking areas has more influences from Sweden  Modern Finnish popular music includes a number of prominent rock bands  jazz musicians  hip hop performers  and dance music acts  During the early 1960s  first significant wave of Finnish rock groups emerged  playing instrumental rock inspired by groups such as The Shadows  Around 1964  Beatlemania arrived in Finland  resulting into further development of the local rock scene  During the late 1960s and 1970s Finnish rock musicians increasingly wrote their own music instead of translating international hits into Finnish  During the decade some progressive rock groups  such as Tasavallan Presidentti and Wigwam  gained respect abroad but failed to make a commercial breakthrough outside Finland  This was also the fate of the rock and roll group Hurriganes  The Finnish punk scene produced some internationally acknowledged names including Terveet K det in 1980s  Hanoi Rocks was a pioneering 1980s glam rock act that left perhaps a deeper mark in the history of popular music than any other Finnish group  giving inspiration for Guns N  Roses  Many Finnish metal bands have gained international recognition  HIM and Nightwish are some of Finland s most internationally known bands  HIM s 2005  Dark Light  album went gold in the United States  Apocalyptica are an internationally famous Finnish group who are most

Arter  First Chair of Politics at Aberdeen University  who in his  Scandinavian Politics Today   Manchester University Press  revised 2008   quotes Jaakko Nousiainen in  From semi presidentialism to parliamentary government  in Scandinavian Political Studies 24  2  p95 109 as follows   There are hardly any grounds for the epithet  semi presidential    Arter s own conclusions are only slightly more nuanced   The adoption of a new constitution on 1 March 2000 meant that Finland was no longer a case of semi presidential government other than in the minimalist sense of a situation where a popularly elected fixed term president exists alongside a prime minister and cabinet who are responsible to parliament  Elgie 2004  317    According to the Finnish Constitution  the president has no possibility to rule the government without the ministerial approval  and does not have the power to dissolve the parliament under his or her own desire  Finland is actually represented by its prime
