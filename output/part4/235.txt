Socialist Republic of Vietnam  Vietnamese  C ng h a x  h i ch  ngh a Vi t Nam   listen    is the easternmost country on the Indochina Peninsula in Southeast Asia  It is bordered by China to the north  Laos to the northwest  Cambodia to the southwest  and the South China Sea   referred to in Vietnam as the East Sea  Vietnamese  Bi n   ng    to the east  With an estimated 90 5 million inhabitants as of 2011  Vietnam is the world s 13th most populous country  and the eighth most populous Asian country  The Vietnamese became independent from Imperial China in 938 AD  following the Battle of B ch   ng River  Successive Vietnamese royal dynasties flourished as the nation expanded geographically and politically into Southeast Asia  until the Indochina Peninsula was colonized by the French in the mid 19th century  The First Indochina War eventually led to their expulsion from the country in 1954 leaving Vietnam divided politically into two countries  Fighting between the two sides continued  with heavy foreign intervention  during the Vietnam War  which ended with a North Vietnamese victory in 1975  Emerging from this prolonged military engagement  the war ravaged Communist nation was politically isolated  In 1986  the government instituted economic and political reforms and began a path towards international reintegration  9  By 2000  it had established diplomatic relations with most nations  Its economic growth has been among the highest in the world since 2000  10  and according to Citigroup  such high growth is set to continue  Vietnam has the highest Global Growth Generators Index among 11 major economies  11  and its successful economic reforms resulted in it joining the World Trade Organization in 2007  However  the country still suffers from relatively high levels of income inequality  disparities in healthcare provision  and poor gender equality  12  13  14  15  16  Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 2 1 Pre Dynastic era 2 2 Dynastic era 2 3 French

Vi t   a name that can be traced back to the Trieu dynasty of the 2nd century BC  17  The word Vi t originated as a shortened form of B ch Vi t      pinyin  B iyu    a word applied to a group of peoples then living in southern China and Vietnam  18  The form  Vietnam       is first recorded in the 16th century oracular poem S m Tr ng Tr nh  19  The name has also been found on 12 steles carved in the 16th and 17th centuries  including one at Bao Lam Pagoda in Haiphong that was carved in 1558  20  Between 1804 and 1813  the name was used officially by Emperor Gia Long  21  It was revived in the early 20th century by nationalists such as Phan Boi Chau  and most notably by the Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang  Vietnamese Nationalist Party   22  The country was usually called Annam until 1945  when Emperor Bao Dai changed the official name back to Vi t Nam  22  Since the use of Chinese characters was discontinued at this time  the alphabetic spelling of Vietnam is now official  History Main article  History of Vietnam Pre Dynastic era The region now known as Vietnam has been inhabited since Paleolithic times  with some archaeological sites in Thanh H a Province purportedly dating back several thousand years  Archaeologists have linked the beginnings of Vietnamese civilization to the late Neolithic early Bronze Age Phung Nguyen culture  which was centered in what is now V nh Ph c Province between 2000 and 1400 BC  By about 1200 BC  the development of wet rice cultivation and bronze casting in the Ma River and Red River floodplains led to the development of the Dong Son culture  notable for its elaborate bronze drums  The bronze weapons  tools  and drums of Dong Son sites show a Southeast Asian influence that indicates an indigenous origin for the bronze casting technology  A Dong Son bronze drum  Many ancient copper mine sites have been found in northern Vietnam  The Dong Son sites share many similarities with other Bronze Age Southeast Asian sites  including the presence of boat shaped coffins  burial jars  and stilt dwellings  and evidence of the customs of betel nut chewing and teeth blackening  Dynastic era The legendary H ng B ng Dynasty of the H ng kings is considered the first Vietnamese state  known in Vietnamese as V n Lang  In 257 BC  the last H ng king was defeated by Th c Ph n  who consolidated the L c Vi t and  u Vi t tribes to form the  u L c  proclaiming himself An D  ng V  ng  In 207 BC  a Chinese general named Zhao Tuo defeated An D  ng V  ng and consolidated  u L c into Nanyue  However  Nanyue was itself incorporated into the empire of the Chinese Han Dynasty in 111 BC  For the next thousand years  Vietnam remained mostly under Chinese rule  23  Early independence movements  such as those of the Tr ng Sisters and Lady Tri u  were only temporarily successful  but the region did become independent as V n Xu n under the Anterior L  Dynasty between 544 and 602 AD  By the early 10th century  Vietnam had gained autonomy  but not independence  under the Kh c family  Map of Vietnam showing the conquest of the south  the Nam ti n   1069 1757  The Imperial City in Hu   In 938 AD  the Vietnamese lord Ng  Quy n defeated Southern Han Chinese forces at B ch   ng River and regained independence after a millennium of Chinese domination  24  Renamed as   i Vi t  en  Great Viet   the nation enjoyed a golden era under the L  and Tr n Dynasties  During the rule of the Tr n Dynasty    i Vi t repelled three Mongol invasions  25  Meanwhile  Buddhism flourished and became the state religion  Following the brief rule of the H  Dynasty  Vietnamese independence was momentarily interrupted by the Chinese Ming Dynasty  but was restored by L  L i  the founder of the L  Dynasty  The Vietnamese dynasties reached their zenith in the L  Dynasty of the 15th century  especially during the reign of Emperor L  Th nh T ng  1460 1497   Between the 11th and 18th centuries  Vietnam expanded southward in a process known as nam ti n  southward expansion   26  eventually conquering the kingdom of Champa and part of the Khmer Empire  27  28  From the 16th century onwards  civil strife and frequent infighting engulfed much of Vietnam  First  the Chinese supported M c Dynasty challenged the L  Dynasty s power  After the M c Dynasty was defeated  the L  Dynasty was nominally reinstalled  but actual power was divided between the northern Tr nh Lords and the southern Nguy n Lords  who engaged in a civil war for more than four decades before a truce was called in the 1670s  During this time  the Nguy n expanded southern Vietnam into the Mekong Delta  annexing the central highlands of Tay Nguyen and the Khmer lands in the Mekong Delta  The division of the country ended a century later when the T y S n brothers established a new dynasty  However  their rule did not last long  and they were defeated by the remnants of the Nguy n Lords  led by Nguy n  nh and aided by the French  29  Nguy n  nh unified Vietnam  and established the Nguy n Dynasty  ruling under the name Gia Long  French colonisation French Indochina in 1913  Main articles  Cochinchina campaign  Sino French War  French Indochina  and Empire of Vietnam Vietnam s independence was gradually eroded by France   aided by large Catholic collaborator militias   in a series of military conquests between 1859 and 1885  after which the entire country became part of French Indochina  The French administration imposed significant political and cultural changes on Vietnamese society  A Western style system of modern education was developed  and Roman Catholicism was propagated widely in Vietnamese society  Most of the French settlers in Indochina were concentrated in Cochinchina   the southern third of Vietnam   based around the city of Saigon  30  Developing a plantation economy to promote the export of tobacco  indigo  tea and coffee  the French largely ignored increasing calls for Vietnamese self government and civil rights  A nationalist political movement soon emerged  with leaders such as Phan Boi Chau  Phan Chu Trinh  Phan Dinh Phung  Emperor H m Nghi and Ho Chi Minh fighting or calling for independence  However  the royalist Can Vuong was defeated in the 1890s after a decade of resistance  and the 1930 Yen Bai mutiny of the Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang was put down easily  The French maintained control of their colonies until World War II  when the war in the Pacific led to the Japanese invasion of French Indochina in 1941  With the defeat of France in Europe in 1940  the French Third Republic was replaced by the Vichy Regime  to which the colony remained loyal  Heavily dependent on Nazi Germany  Vichy France was forced to surrender control of French Indochina to Germany s ally  Japan  The natural resources of Vietnam were exploited for the purposes of the Japanese Empire s military campaigns into the British Indochinese colonies of Burma  the Malay Peninsula and India  The Japanese occupation was a key cause of the Vietnamese Famine of 1945  which caused around two million deaths  equivalent to as much as 10  of the contemporary population  31  First Indochina War Main articles  First Indochina War  Democratic Republic of Vietnam  State of Vietnam  State of Vietnam referendum  1955  and Operation Passage to Freedom In 1941  the Viet Minh   a communist and nationalist liberation movement   emerged under the Marxist Leninist revolutionary Ho Chi Minh  who sought independence for Vietnam from France and the end of the Japanese occupation  Following the military defeat of Japan and the fall of its puppet Empire of Vietnam in August 1945  the Viet Minh occupied Hanoi and proclaimed a provisional government  which asserted national independence on 2 September  32  A French marked USAF C 119 flown by CIA pilots over Dien Bien Phu in 1954  In the same year  the Provisional French Republic sent the French Far East Expeditionary Corps   originally created to fight the Japanese occupation forces   to pacify the Vietnamese liberation movement and to restore French colonial rule  On 23 November 1946  French vessels bombarded the port city of Hai Phong  and the Viet Minh s guerrilla campaign against French forces began soon after  The resulting First Indochina War lasted until 20 July 1954  Despite taking fewer losses during the course of the war   the Expeditionary Corps suffered one third of the casualties of the Chinese and Soviet backed Viet Minh   the French and Vietnamese loyalists eventually suffered a major strategic setback at the Siege of Dien Bien Phu  which allowed Ho Chi Minh to negotiate a ceasefire from a favorable position at the Geneva Conference of 1954  The colonial administration ended and French Indochina was dissolved under the Geneva Accords of 1954  which separated the forces of former French supporters and communist nationalists at the 17th parallel north with the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone  A 300 day period of free movement was given  during which almost a million northerners  mainly Catholic  moved south  fearing persecution by the communists  The partition of Vietnam  with Ho Chi Minh s Democratic Republic of Vietnam in North Vietnam  and Emperor B o   i s State of Vietnam in South Vietnam  was not intended to be permanent by the Geneva Accords  and the Accords expressly forbade the interference of third powers  However  in 1955  the State of Vietnam s Prime Minister  Ngo Dinh Diem  toppled B o   i in a fraudulent referendum organised by his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu  and proclaimed himself president of the Republic of Vietnam  The Accords mandated nationwide elections by 1956  which Diem refused to hold  despite repeated calls from the North for talks to discuss elections  33  Vietnam War Main articles  Vietnam War  North Vietnam  South Vietnam  Ngo Dinh Diem  Buddhist crisis  Role of the United States in the Vietnam War  ARVN  Viet Cong  Ho Chi Minh Trail  and Operation Menu The pro Hanoi Vietcong began a guerrilla campaign in the late 1950s to overthrow Diem s government  which an official Vietcong statement described as a  disguised colonial regime   33  In the North  thousands of landowners were killed by the communists  and collectivization efforts led to a brief famine  In the South  Diem went about crushing political and religious opposition  imprisoning or killing tens of thousands  dissidents were routinely labelled as communists even if they were anti communist  Both Vietnams developed into virtual police states  citation needed  A Vietcong soldier stands guard during a prisoner exchange with American

coup that saw Diem and Nhu killed  Diem was followed by a series of corrupt military regimes that often lasted only months before being toppled by other military officers  With South Vietnam paralyzed by instability  the communists began to gain ground  There were more than a dozen South Vietnamese governments between 1961 and 1965  before the pairing of Air Marshal Nguyen Cao Ky and General Nguy n V n Thi u took control in mid 1965  Thieu gradually outmaneuvered Ky and cemented his grip on power in fraudulent elections in 1967 and 1971  citation needed  To support South Vietnam s struggle against the communist insurgency  the United States began increasing its contribution of military advisers  using the controversial 1964 Tonkin Gulf incident as a pretext for such intervention  US forces became embroiled in ground combat operations in 1965  and at their peak they numbered more than 500 000  34  35  Communist forces attacked most major targets in South Vietnam during the 1968 Tet Offensive  and although their campaign failed militarily  it shocked the American establishment  and turned US public opinion against the war  36  Communist forces supplying the Vietcong carried supplies along the Ho Chi Minh trail  which passed through Laos and Cambodia  US president Richard Nixon authorized Operation Menu  an SAC bombing campaign in Laos and Cambodia  which he kept secret from the US Congress  37  38  Its own casualties mounting  and facing opposition to the war at home and condemnation abroad  the US began withdrawing from ground combat roles according to the Nixon Doctrine  the process was subsequently called Vietnamization  The effort had mixed results  failing to stabilize South Vietnam  The Paris Peace Accords of 27 January 1973 formally recognized the sovereignty of Vietnam  as recognized by the 1954 Geneva Agreements   Under the terms of the accords  all American combat troops were withdrawn by 29 March 1973  Limited fighting continued  before North Vietnam captured the province of Phuoc Long in December 1974 and started a full scale offensive  culminating in the Fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975  South Vietnam briefly came under the nominal rule of a Provisional Revolutionary Government while under military occupation by North Vietnam  On 2 July 1976  North and South Vietnam were merged to form the Socialist Republic of Vietnam  1  Postwar period A street market on Chau Van Diep street  Ho Chi Minh City  in 2007  In the aftermath of the war  the government embarked on a mass campaign of collectivization of farms and factories  This caused an economic collapse and resulted in triple digit inflation  Reconstruction of the war ravaged country was slow  and serious humanitarian and economic problems confronted the communist regime  Millions of people fled the country in crudely built boats  creating an international humanitarian crisis  39  40  In 1978  the Vietnamese military invaded Cambodia to remove from power the Khmer Rouge  who had been razing Vietnamese border villages and massacring the inhabitants  41  Vietnam was victorious  installing a regime in Cambodia whose leaders ruled until 1989  42  This action worsened relations with the Chinese  who launched a brief incursion into northern Vietnam in 1979  43  This conflict caused Vietnam to rely even more heavily on Soviet economic and military aid    i M i   Renovation   Main article  Doi Moi At the Sixth Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam in December 1986  reformist politicians  upset by the country s lack of economic progress after the Vietnam War  44  replaced the  old guard  government with new leadership  45  The reformers were led by 71 year old Nguyen Van Linh  who became the party s new general secretary  45  Linh was a native of northern Vietnam who had served in the south both during and after the Vietnam War  44  45  In a historic shift  Linh and the reformers implemented a series of free market reforms   known as   i M i  Renovation    which carefully managed the transition from a planned economy to a  socialist oriented market economy   46  47  Though the authority of the state remained unchallenged  the government encouraged private ownership of farms and factories  economic deregulation and foreign investment  while maintaining control over strategic industries  47  The economy of Vietnam subsequently achieved rapid growth in agricultural and industrial production  construction  exports and foreign investment  However  these reforms have also caused a rise in income inequality and gender disparities  14  15

Minh Mausoleum in Hanoi  The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a single party state  Its current state constitution  which replaced the 1975 constitution in April 1992  asserts the central role of the Communist Party of Vietnam in all organs of government  politics and society  The General Secretary of the Communist Party performs numerous key administrative and executive functions  controlling the party s national organization and state appointments  as well as setting policy  Only political organizations affiliated with or endorsed by the Communist Party are permitted to contest elections in Vietnam  These include the Vietnamese Fatherland Front and worker and trade unionist parties  Although the state remains officially committed to socialism as its defining creed  its economic policies are increasingly capitalist  48  with the The Economist defining its leadership as  ardently capitalist communists   49  The President of Vietnam is the titular head of state and the nominal commander

Geography and climate Main articles  Geography of Vietnam and Climate of Vietnam A panorama of Vietnam s Ha Long Bay  a UNESCO World Heritage Site  Terraced fields in Sa Pa  Vietnam is located on the eastern Indochina Peninsula between the latitudes 8  and 24 N  and the longitudes 102  and 110 E  It covers a total area of approximately 331 210 km2  127 881 sq mi   2  excluding the Hoang Sa and Truong Sa islands  making it almost the size of Germany  The combined length of the country s land boundaries is 4 639 km  2 883 mi   and its coastline is 3 444 km  2 140 mi  long  2  Vietnam s land is mostly hilly and densely forested  with level land covering no more than 20   Mountains account for 40  of the country s land area  and tropical forests cover around 42   The northern part of the country consists mostly of highlands and the Red River Delta  Phan Xi P ng  located in L o Cai province  is the highest mountain in Vietnam  standing 3 143 m  10 312 ft  high  Southern Vietnam is divided into coastal lowlands  Annamite Chain peaks  and extensive forests  Comprising five relatively flat plateaus of basalt soil  the highlands account for 16  of the country s arable land and 22  of its total forested land  The soil in much of southern Vietnam is relatively poor in nutrients  Countryside around C i Mon in the Mekong Delta  The Red River Delta  also known as the S ng H ng   a flat  roughly triangular region covering 15 000 km2  5 792 sq mi   56  is smaller but more intensely developed and more densely populated than the Mekong River Delta  Once an inlet of the Gulf of Tonkin  it has been filled in over the millennia by riverine alluvial deposits  and it advances 100 meters  328 1 ft  into the Gulf annually  The Mekong delta  covering about 40 000 km2  15 444 sq mi   is a low level plain no more than 3 meters  9 8 ft  above sea level at any point  It is criss crossed by a maze of rivers and canals  which carry so much sediment that the delta advances 60 to 80 meters  196 9 to 262 5 ft  into the sea every year  Because of differences in latitude and the marked variety in topographical relief  the Vietnamese climate tends to vary considerably from place to place  During the winter or dry season  extending roughly from November to April  the monsoon winds usually blow from the northeast along the China coast and across the Gulf of Tonkin  picking up considerable moisture  Consequently  the winter season in most parts of the country is dry only by comparison with the rainy or summer season  The average annual temperature is generally higher in the plains than in the mountains  and higher in the south than in the north  Temperatures vary less in the southern plains around Ho Chi Minh City and the Mekong Delta  ranging between 21 and 28  C  69 8 and 82 4  F  over the course of a year  Seasonal variations in the mountains and plateaus and in the north are much more dramatic  with temperatures varying from 5  C  41  F  in December and January to 37  C  98 6  F  in July and August  Ecology and biodiversity Vietnam has two World Natural Heritage Sites   Ha Long Bay and Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park   and six biosphere reserves  including

According to Chapter 1 of the 2005 National Environmental Present Condition Report   Biodiversity Subject of Vietnam Environment Protection Agency   57  in terms of species diversity Vietnam is one of twenty five countries considered to possess a uniquely high level of biodiversity  and is ranked 16th in biological diversity worldwide  having 16  of the world s species  15 986 species of flora have been identified in the country  of which 10  are endemic  while Vietnam s fauna include 307 nematode species  200 oligochaeta  145 acarina  113 springtails  7 750 insects  260 reptiles  120 amphibians  840 birds and 310 mammals  of which 100 birds and 78 mammals are endemic  57  Vietnam is furthermore home to 1 438 species of freshwater microalgae  constituting 9 6  of all microalgae species  as well as 794 aquatic invertebrates and 2 458 species of sea fish  57  In recent years  13 genera  222 species  and 30 taxa of flora have been newly described in Vietnam  57  Six new mammal species  including the saola  giant muntjac and Tonkin Snub nosed Langur have also been discovered  along with one new bird species  Edwards s Pheasant  citation needed  In the late 1980s  a small population of Javan Rhinoceros was found in C t Ti n National Park  However  the last individual of the species in Vietnam was reportedly shot in 2010  58  In agricultural genetic diversity  Vietnam is one of the world s twelve original cultivar centers  The Vietnam National Cultivar Gene Bank is preserving 12 300 cultivars of 115 species  57  The Vietnamese government spent US 49 07 million on the preservation of biodiversity in 2004 alone  and has established 126 conservation areas  including 28 national parks  57  Economy Main article  Economy of Vietnam Rice transplanting in Tuy H a  Vietnam has been  for much of its history  a predominantly agricultural civilization based on wet rice cultivation  However  the Vietnam War destroyed much of the country s agrarian economy  leading the post war government to implement a planned economy to revitalise agriculture and industrialise the nation  The collectivization of farms  factories and economic capital was implemented  and millions of people were put to work in government programs  For a decade following the Vietnam War  Vietnam s economy was plagued with inefficiency and corruption in state programs  poor quality and underproduction  and restrictions on economic activity  It also suffered from the post war trade embargo instituted by the United States and most of Europe  These problems were compounded by the erosion of the Soviet bloc  which included Vietnam s main trading partners  in the late 1980s  In 1986  the Sixth Party Congress of Vietnam introduced free market economic reforms as part of a broad reform package called   i M i  Renovation   resulting in a socialist oriented market economy  Private ownership was encouraged in industries  commerce and agriculture  59  Thanks largely to these reforms  Vietnam achieved around 8  annual GDP growth between 1990 to 1997  and the economy continued to grow at an annual rate of around 7  from 2000 to 2005  making Vietnam one of the world s

of the Central Highlands also speak a number of distinct languages  The French language  a legacy of colonial rule  is still spoken by some older Vietnamese as a second language  but has declined in popularity  Vietnam nevertheless remains a full member of the Francophonie  Russian   and to a much lesser extent German  Czech and Polish   are known among some Vietnamese whose families had ties with the Soviet bloc during the Cold War  In recent years  as Vietnam s contacts with Western nations have increased  English has become more popular as a second language  the study of English is now obligatory in most schools  replacing French  though the latter is used at times in higher education  Chinese and Japanese have also grown in popularity as Vietnam s links with China and Japan have strengthened  Religion Main article  Religion in Vietnam The One Pillar Pagoda in Hanoi  For much of Vietnamese history  Mahayana Buddhism  Taoism and Confucianism have been the dominant religions

South Vietnam  The largest Protestant churches are the Evangelical Church of Vietnam and the Montagnard Evangelical Church  Two thirds of Vietnam s Protestants are reportedly members of ethnic minorities  89  The main Cao Dai temple in the city of Tay Ninh  The Vietnamese government is widely seen as suspicious of Roman Catholicism  This mistrust originated during the 19th century  when some Catholics collaborated with the French colonists in conquering and ruling the country and in helping French attempts to install Catholic emperors  such as in the L  V n Kh i revolt of 1833  Furthermore  the Catholic Church s strongly anti communist stance has made it an enemy of the Vietnamese state  The Vatican Church is officially banned  and only government controlled Catholic organisations are permitted  However  Vietnam s relations with the Vatican have improved in recent years  Several other minority faiths exist in Vietnam  About 3  of the population are adherents of Cao Dai  a syncretic modern religion whose followers are largely concentrated in Tay Ninh Province  Sunni and Cham Bani Islam is primarily practiced by the ethnic Cham minority  though there are also

number of specialist colleges  established to develop a more diverse and skilled national workforce  A large number of Vietnam s most acclaimed universities are based in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City  Facing serious crises  Vietnam s education system is under a holistic program of reform launched by the government  Education is not free  therefore  some poor families may have trouble paying tuition for their children without some form of public or private assistance  Regardless  school enrollment is among the highest in the world  and the number of colleges and universities increased

broadcasting service  broadcasting internationally via shortwave using rented transmitters in other countries  and providing broadcasts from its website  Vietnam Television is the national television broadcasting company  As Vietnam moved toward a free market economy under its   i M i reform program  the government s reliance on the print media to keep the public informed about its policies led to a near doubling in the number of newspapers and magazines in the late 1990s and early 2000s  citation needed  Since 1997  Vietnam has extensively regulated public Internet access  using both legal and technical means  The resulting lockdown is widely referred to as the  Bamboo Firewall   100  The collaborative project OpenNet Initiative classifies Vietnam s level of online political censorship to be  pervasive   101  while Reporters without Borders considers Vietnam to be one of 15 global  internet enemies   102  Though the government of Vietnam claims to safeguard the country against obscene
