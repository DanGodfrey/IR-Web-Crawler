n h rts  o  vi n    Bosnian  Croatian and Serbian  Bosna i Hercegovina  Cyrillic script                        sometimes called Bosnia Herzegovina  or simply Bosnia  is a country in Southeastern Europe  on the Balkan Peninsula  Its capital and largest city is Sarajevo  Bordered by Croatia to the north  west and south  Serbia to the east  and Montenegro to the southeast  Bosnia and Herzegovina is almost landlocked  except for the 20 kilometres  12 miles  of coastline on the Adriatic Sea surrounding the town of Neum  8  9  In the central and southern interior of the country the geography is mountainous  in the northwest it is moderately hilly  and the northeast is predominantly flatland  The inland is a geographically larger region and has a moderate continental climate  bookended by hot summers and cold and snowy winters  The southern tip of the country has a Mediterranean climate and plain topography  The country that is now Bosnia and Herzegovina is a region that traces permanent human settlement back to the Neolithic age  Culturally  politically and socially  the country has one of the richest histories in the region  having been first settled by the Slavic peoples that populate the area today from the 6th through to the 9th centuries AD  They then established the first independent Banate in the 12th century upon the arrival and convergence of people that would eventually come to call themselves Dobri Bo njani  literally  Good Bosnians    This evolved into the Kingdom of Bosnia in the 14th century  after which it was annexed into the Ottoman Empire  under whose rule it would remain from the mid 15th to the late 18th century  The Ottomans brought Islam to the region  and altered much of the cultural and social outlook of the country  This was followed by annexation into the Austro Hungarian Monarchy  which lasted up until the end of World War I  Following the dissolution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  the country  like most other in the region  proclaimed independence in 1992  which was followed by a bloody war  which lasted until late 1995  Today  the country maintains high literacy  life expectancy and education levels and is one of the most frequently visited countries in the region  10  Bosnia and Herzegovina is regionally and internationally renowned for its natural beauty and cultural heritage inherited from six historical civilizations  its cuisine  winter sports  its eclectic and unique architecture and the Sarajevo Film Festival and Sarajevo Jazz Festivals  both the largest and most prominent of their kind in Southeastern Europe  11  12  The country is home to three ethnic groups or  officially  constituent peoples  a term unique for Bosnia and Herzegovina  Bosniaks are the largest group of the three  with Serbs second and Croats third  Regardless of ethnicity  a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina is often identified in English as a Bosnian  The terms Herzegovinian and Bosnian are maintained as a regional rather than ethnic distinction  and the region of Herzegovina has no precisely defined borders of its own  Moreover  the country was simply called  Bosnia   without Herzegovina  until the Austro Hungarian occupation at the end of the nineteenth century  13  Formerly one of the six federal units constituting the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  Bosnia and Herzegovina gained its independence during the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s  Bosnia and Herzegovina is a parliamentary republic  which has a bicameral legislature and a three member Presidency composed of a member of each major ethnic group  However  the central government s power is highly limited  as the country is largely decentralized and comprises two autonomous entities  the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska  with a third region  the Br ko District  governed under local government  The country is a potential candidate for membership to the European Union and has been a candidate for NATO membership since April 2010  when it received a Membership Action Plan at the summit in Tallinn  Additionally  the country has been a member of the Council of Europe since April 2002 and a founding member of the Mediterranean Union upon its establishment in July 2008  Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 2 1 Early history 2 2 Medieval Bosnia 2 3 Ottoman Era  1463 1878  2 4 Austro Hungarian

Imperio  a politico geographical handbook written by the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII in the mid 10th century  between 948 and 952  describing the  small country          in Greek  of  Bosona            14  The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja from 1172 1196 of Bar s Roman Catholic Christian Archbishop Grgur names Bosnia  and references an earlier source from the year of 753   the De Regno Sclavorum  Of the Realm of Slavs   The name  Bosnia  probably comes from the name of the Bosna river around which it has been historically based  which was recorded in the Roman era under the name Bossina  15  More direct roots of the river s names are unknown  Philologist Anton Mayer proposed a connection with the Indo European root  bos or  bogh  meaning  running water   16  Certain Roman sources similarly mention Bathinus flumen as a name of the Illyrian Bosona  both of which would mean  running water  as well  16  Other theories involve the rare Latin term Bosina  meaning boundary  and possible Slavic origins  16  The origins of  Herzegovina  can be identified with more precision  During the Early Middle Ages the region was known as Hum  from the Zachlumoi tribe of southern Slavs which inhabited it  In the 1440s  the region was ruled by the powerful nobleman Stefan Vuk i  Kosa a  In a document sent to Friedrich III on January 20  1448  Stefan Vuk i  Kosa a called himself  Herzog of Saint Sava  Lord of Hum and Primorje  Grand Duke of Bosnia   Herzog is the German for  duke   and so the lands he controlled later became known as Herzegovina   Dukedom   from the addition of  ovina   land    15  The region was administered by the Ottomans as the sanjak and then pashaluk of Hersek  The name Herzegovina was first included in the official name of the then Ottoman province in the mid 19th century  dubious   discuss  On initial proclamation of independence in 1992 the country s official name was the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina but following the 1995 Dayton Agreement and the new constitution that accompanied it the name was officially changed to Bosnia and Herzegovina   edit  History Main article  History of Bosnia and Herzegovina  edit  Early history Main article  Early history of Bosnia and Herzegovina Bosnia has been inhabited since at least the Neolithic age  The earliest Neolithic population became known in the Antiquity as the Illyrians  Celtic migrations in the 4th century BC were also notable  Concrete historical evidence for this period is scarce  but overall it appears that the region was populated by a number of different peoples speaking distinct languages  Conflict between the Illyrians and Romans started in 229 BC  but Rome did not complete its annexation of the region until AD 9  Walls of ancient Daorson  O ani i near Stolac  Bosnia and Herzegovina  3rd century BC  It was precisely in what is now Bosnia and Herzegovina that Rome fought one of the most difficult battles in its history since the Punic Wars  as described by the Roman historian Suetonius  17  This was the Roman campaign against the revolt of indigenous communities from Illyricum  known in history as the Great Illyrian Revolt  and also as the Pannonian revolt  or Bellum Batonianum  the latter named after two leaders of the rebellious Illyrian communities  Bato Baton of the Daesitiates  and Bato of the Breuci  18  The Great Illyrian revolt was a rising up of Illyrians against the Romans  more specifically a revolt against Tiberius  attempt to recruit them for his war against the Germans  The Illyrians put up a fierce resistance to the most powerful army on earth at the time citation needed   the Roman Army  for four years  AD 6 to AD 9   but they were finally subdued by Rome in AD 9  The last Illyrian stronghold  of which their defence won the admiration of Roman historians  is said to have been Arduba  19  Bato of Daesitiates was captured and taken to Italy  It is alleged that when Tiberius asked Bato and the Daesitiates why they had rebelled  Baton was reputed to have answered   You Romans are to blame for this  for you send as guardians of your flocks  not dogs or shepherds  but wolves   Bato spent the rest of his life in the Italian town of Ravenna  20  In the Roman period  Latin speaking settlers from the entire Roman Empire settled among the Illyrians  and Roman soldiers were encouraged to retire in the region  15  The land was originally part of Illyria up until the Roman occupation  Following the split of the Roman Empire between 337 and 395 AD  Dalmatia and Pannonia became parts of the Western Roman Empire  Some claim that the region was conquered by the Ostrogoths in 455 AD  It subsequently changed hands between the Alans and the Huns  By the 6th century  Emperor Justinian had reconquered the area for the Byzantine Empire  The Illyrians were conquered by the Avars in the 6th century   edit  Medieval Bosnia Main article  History of Bosnia and Herzegovina  958 1463  Tvrtko I of Bosnia ruled in 1353 1366 and again in 1367 1377 as ban and in 1377 1391 as the first King of Bosnia  Expansion of the Bosnian kingdom in the XIV century Modern knowledge of the political situation in the west Balkans during the Early Middle Ages is unclear  Upon their arrival  the Slavs brought with them a tribal social structure which probably fell apart and gave way to Feudalism only with Frankish penetration into the region in the late 9th century  The Slavic tribes also brought their mythology and pagan system of beliefs  the Rodovjerje  In particular  Perun          the highest god of the pantheon and the god of thunder and lightning is also commonly found in Bosnian toponymy  for instance in the name of Mount Perun  Perunova Gora                   Along with the Slavic settlers  the native Illyrians were Christianized  Bosnia and Herzegovina  because of its geographic position and terrain  was probably one of the last areas to go through this process  which presumably originated from the urban centers along the Dalmatian coast  Thus  Slavic Bosnian tribes remained pagans for a longer time  and finally converted to the Bogumil Christian faith  The principalities of Serbia and Croatia split control of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 9th and 10th century  but by the High Middle Ages political circumstance led to the area being contested between the Kingdom of Hungary and the Byzantine Empire  Following another shift of power between the two in the early 12th century  Bosnia found itself outside the control of both and emerged as an independent state under the rule of local bans  15  The first verification needed  Bosnian monarch was Ban Bori   The second verification needed  was Ban Kulin whose rule marked the start of a controversy with the Bosnian Church  because he allowed an indigenous Bogomilism sect considered heretical by the Roman Catholic Church  In response to Hungarian attempts to use church politics regarding the issue as a way to reclaim sovereignty over Bosnia  Kulin held a council of local church leaders to renounce the heresy and embraced Catholicism in 1203  Despite this  Hungarian ambitions remained unchanged long after Kulin s death in 1204  waning only after an unsuccessful invasion in 1254  Bosnian history from then until the early 14th century was marked by a power struggle between the  ubi  and Kotromani  families  This conflict came to an end in 1322  when Stephen II Kotromani  became Ban  By the time of his death in 1353  he was successful in annexing territories to the north and west  as well as Zahumlje and parts of Dalmatia  He was succeeded by his nephew Tvrtko who  following a prolonged struggle with nobility and inter family strife  gained full control of the country in 1367  Tvrtko crowned himself on 26 October 1377 as Stephen Tvrtko I the King of Rascia  Bosnia  Dalmatia  Croatia  the Seaside  Based on archaeological evidence  he was crowned in the in Mile near Visoko in the church which was built in the time of Stephen II Kotromani  s reign  where he was also buried alongside his uncle Stjepan II  21  22  Following his death in 1391 however  Bosnia fell into a long period of decline  The Ottoman Empire had already started its conquest of Europe and posed a major threat to the Balkans throughout the first half of the 15th century  Finally  after decades of political and social instability  the Kingdom of Bosnia ceased to exist in 1463   edit  Ottoman Era  1463 1878  Main article  History of Bosnia and Herzegovina  1463 1878  The Ottoman provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 17th century  The Ottoman conquest of Bosnia marked a new era in the country s history and introduced drastic changes in the political and cultural landscape  The Ottomans allowed for the preservation of Bosnia s identity by incorporating it as an integral province of the Ottoman Empire with its historical name and territorial integrity   a unique case among subjugated states in the Balkans  23  Within Bosnia the Ottomans introduced a number of key changes in the territory s socio political administration  including a new landholding system  a reorganization of administrative units  and a complex system of social differentiation by class and religious affiliation  15  The three centuries of Ottoman rule also had a drastic impact on Bosnia s population make up  which changed several times as a result of the empire s conquests  frequent wars with European powers  forced and economic migrations  and epidemics  A native Slavic speaking Muslim community emerged and eventually became the largest of the ethno religious groups due to the restriction imposed by the Ottoman Empire  16  and conversions for gain  The Bosnian Christian communities also experienced major changes  The Bosnian Franciscans  and the Catholic population as a whole  were to a minor extent protected by official imperial decree  while the Bosnian Church disappeared altogether  15  As the Ottoman Empire continued their rule in the Balkans  Rumelia   Bosnia was somewhat relieved of the pressures of being a frontier province  and experienced a period of general welfare  A number of cities  such as Sarajevo and Mostar  were established and grew into regional centers of trade and urban culture and were then visited by Ottoman traveler Evliya  elebi in 1648  Within these cities  various Ottoman Sultans financed the construction of many works of Bosnian architecture such as the country s first library in Sarajevo  madrassas  a school of Sufi philosophy  and a clock tower  Sahat Kula   bridges such as the Stari Most  the Tsar s Mosque and the Gazi Husrev beg s Mosque  Furthermore  some Bosnians played influential roles in the Ottoman Empire s cultural and political history during this time  23  Bosnian recruits formed a large component of the Ottoman ranks in the battles of Moh cs and Krbava field  while numerous other Bosnians rose through the ranks of the Ottoman military to occupy the highest positions of power in the Empire  including admirals such as Matrak   Nasuh  generals such as Isa Beg Isakovi   Gazi Husrev beg and Telli Hasan Pasha  administrators such as Ferhat pa a Sokolovi  and Osman Grada  evi   and Grand Viziers such as the influential Mehmed Pa a Sokolovi   Some Bosnians emerged as Sufi mystics  scholars such as Ali D abi   and poets in the Turkish  Albanian  Arabic  and Persian languages  16  However  by the late 17th century the Empire s military misfortunes caught up with the country  and the conclusion of the Great Turkish War with the treaty of Karlowitz in 1699 once again made Bosnia the Empire s westernmost province  The following century was marked by further military failures  numerous revolts within Bosnia  and several outbursts of plague  The Porte s false efforts at modernizing the Ottoman state were met with distrust growing to hostility in Bosnia  where local aristocrats stood to lose much through the proposed reforms  This  combined with frustrations over political concessions to nascent Christian states in the east  culminated in an unsuccessful revolt by Husein Grada  evi   in 1831 after the Turkish Sultan Mahmud II slaughtered and abolished the Janissary  16  Related rebellions would be extinguished by 1850  but the situation continued to deteriorate  Later agrarian unrest eventually sparked the Herzegovinian rebellion  a widespread peasant uprising  in 1875  The conflict rapidly spread and came to involve several Balkan states and Great Powers  a situation which eventually led to the Congress of Berlin and the Treaty of Berlin in 1878  15   edit  Austro Hungarian rule  1878 1918  Main article  History of Bosnia and Herzegovina  1878 1918  A Croat from Central Bosnia  1901   At the Congress of Berlin in 1878  the Austro Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Andr ssy obtained the occupation and administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina  and he also obtained the right to station garrisons in the Sanjak of Novi Pazar  which remained under Ottoman administration  The Sanjak preserved the separation of Serbia and Montenegro  and the Austro Hungarian garrisons there would open the way for a dash to Salonika that  would bring the western half of the Balkans under permanent Austrian influence   24   High  Austro Hungarian  military authorities desired  an     immediate major expedition with Salonika as its objective   25  On 28 September 1878 the Finance Minister  Koloman von Zell  threatened to resign if the army  backed by the Archduke Albert  were allowed to advance to Salonika  In the session of the Hungarian Parliament of 5 November 1878 the Opposition proposed that the Foreign Minister should be impeached for violating the constitution with his policy during the Near East Crisis and by the occupation of Bosnia Herzegovina  The motion lost 179 to 95  The gravest accusations were raised by the opposition rank and file against Andrassy  25  Although an Austro Hungarian side quickly came to an agreement with Bosnians  tensions remained in certain parts of the country  particularly the south  and a mass emigration of predominantly Slavic dissidents occurred  15  However  a state of relative stability was reached soon enough and Austro Hungarian authorities were able to embark on a number of social and administrative reforms which intended to make Bosnia and Herzegovina into a  model colony   With the aim of establishing the province as a stable political model that would help dissipate rising South Slav nationalism  Habsburg rule did much to codify laws  to introduce new political practices  and to provide for modernisation  The Austro Hungarian Empire built the three Roman Catholic churches in Sarajevo and these three churches are among only 20 Catholic churches in the state of Bosnia  Within three years of formal occupation of Bosnia Herzegovina  Austria Hungary  in 1881  obtained German  and more importantly  Russian  approval for the annexation of these provinces  at a time which suited Vienna  This mandate was formally ratified by the Dreikaiserbund  Three Emperor s Treaty  on June 18 of that year  26  Upon the accession of Czar Nicholas II  however  the Russians reneged on the agreement  asserting in 1897 the need for special scrutiny of the Bosnian Annexation issue at an unspecified future date  27  A plaque commemorating the location of the Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria  External matters began to affect the Bosnian Protectorate  however  and its relationship with Austria Hungary  A bloody coup occurred in Serbia  on June 10  1903  which brought a radical anti Austrian government into power in Belgrade  28  Serb attempts to foment agitation followed  advocating a unified South Slavic state  ruled from Belgrade  This gained little support amongst most of the population of Bosnia Herzegovina  and only found fertile ground with disaffected portions of the Orthodox minority  Also  the revolt in the Ottoman Empire in 1908  raised concerns that the Istanbul government might seek the outright return of Bosnia Herzegovina  These factors caused the Austrian Hungarian government to seek a permanent resolution of the Bosnian question  sooner  rather than later  On July 2  1908  in response to the pressing of the Austrian Hungarian claim  the Russian Imperial Foreign Minister Alexander Izvolsky offered to support the Bosnian Annexation in return for Vienna s support for Russia s bid for naval access through the Dardanelles Straits into the Mediterranean  29  With the Russians being  at least  provisionally willing to keep their word over Bosnia Herzegovina for the first time in 11 years  Austria Hungary waited and then published the annexation proclamation on October 6  1908  The international furor over the annexation announcement caused Izvolsky to drop the Dardanelles Straits question  altogether  in an effort to obtain a European conference over the Bosnian Annexation  30  This conference never materialized and without British or French support  the Russians and their client state  Serbia  were compelled to accept the Austrian Hungarian annexation of Bosnia Herzegovina in March 1909  Political tensions culminated on 28 June 1914  when Serb nationalist youth Gavrilo Princip  a member of movement Young Bosnia  assassinated the heir to the Austro Hungarian throne  Archduke Franz Ferdinand  in Sarajevo   an event that proved to be the spark that set off World War I  Although some Bosnians died serving in the armies of the various warring states  Bosnia and Herzegovina itself managed to escape the conflict relatively unscathed  23   edit  Kingdom of Yugoslavia  1918 1941  Main article  History of Bosnia and Herzegovina  1918 1941  Following the war  Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the South Slav kingdom of Serbs  Croats and Slovenes  soon renamed Yugoslavia   Political life in Bosnia at this time was marked by two major trends  social and economic unrest over property redistribution  and formation of several political parties that frequently changed coalitions and alliances with parties in other Yugoslav regions  23  The dominant ideological conflict of the Yugoslav state  between Croatian regionalism and Serbian centralization  was approached differently by Bosnia s major ethnic groups and was dependent on the overall political atmosphere  15  The political reforms brought about in the newly established Yugoslavian kingdom saw few benefits for the Bosniaks  according to the 1910 final census of land ownership and population according to religious affiliation conducted in Austro Hungary  Muslims  Bosniaks  owned 91 1   Orthodox Serbians owned 6 0   Croatian Catholics owned 2 6  and others  0 3  of the property  Following the reforms Bosnian Muslims had a total of 1 175 305 hectares of agricultural and forest land taken away from them  31  Although the initial split of the country into 33 oblasts erased the presence of traditional geographic entities from the map  the efforts of Bosnian politicians such as Mehmed Spaho ensured that the six oblasts carved up from Bosnia and Herzegovina corresponded to the six sanjaks from Ottoman times and  thus  matched the country s traditional boundary as a whole  15  The establishment of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929  however  brought the redrawing of administrative regions into banates or banovinas that purposely avoided all historical and ethnic lines  removing any trace of a Bosnian entity  15  Serbo Croat tensions over the structuring of the Yugoslav state continued  with the concept of a separate Bosnian division receiving little or no consideration  The famous Cvetkovi  Ma ek Agreement that created the Croatian banate in 1939 encouraged what was essentially a partition of Bosnia between Croatia and Serbia  16  However the rising threat of Adolf Hitler s Nazi Germany forced Yugoslav politicians to shift their attention  Following a period that saw attempts at appeasement  the signing of the Tripartite Treaty  and a coup d  tat  Yugoslavia was finally invaded by Germany on 6 April 1941  15   edit  World War II  1941 45  Main article  History

and Herzegovina  Once the kingdom of Yugoslavia was conquered by Nazi forces in World War II  all of Bosnia was ceded to the Independent State of Croatia  The Croat leaders embarked on a campaign of extermination of Serbs  Jews  Roma  communists and large numbers of Josip Broz Tito s Partisans by setting up a number of death camps  Many Serbs themselves took up arms and joined the Chetniks  a Serb nationalist movement that conducted operations coordinated with Nazi forces against the partisans  The Chetniks were also known to persecute and murder non Serbs and communist sympathizers  They committed many war crimes against Bosnian Muslims in Eastern Bosnia  On October 12  1941 a group of 108 notable Muslim citizens of Sarajevo signed the Resolution of Sarajevo Muslims by which they condemned the persecution of Serbs organized by Usta e  made distinction between Muslims who participated in such persecutions and whole Muslim population  presented informations about the persecutions of Muslims by Serbs and requested security for all citizens of the country  regardless of their identity  32  Starting in 1941  Yugoslav communists under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito organized their own multi ethnic resistance group  the partisans  who fought against both Axis and Chetnik forces  On 29 November 1943 the Anti Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia with Tito at its helm held a founding conference in Jajce where Bosnia and Herzegovina was reestablished as a republic within the Yugoslavian federation in its Habsburg borders  Military success eventually prompted the Allies to support the Partisans  but Tito declined their offer to help and relied on his own forces instead  All the major military offensives by the antifascist movement of Yugoslavia against Nazis and their local supporters were conducted in Bosnia Herzegovina and its peoples bore the brunt of fighting  More than 300 000 people died in Bosnia and Herzegovina in World War II  33  At the end of the war the establishment of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  with the constitution of 1946  officially made Bosnia and Herzegovina one of six constituent republics in the new state  15   edit  Socialist Yugoslavia  1945 1992  Main article  History of Bosnia and Herzegovina  1945 1992  Because of its central geographic position within the Yugoslavian federation  post war Bosnia was selected as a base for the development of the military defense industry  This contributed to a large concentration of arms and military personnel in Bosnia  a significant factor in the war that followed the break up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s  15  However  Bosnia s existence within Yugoslavia  for the large part  was peaceful and prosperous  Though considered a political backwater of the federation for much of the 1950s and 1960s  in the 1970s a strong Bosnian political elite arose  fueled in part by Tito s leadership in the Non Aligned Movement and Bosnians serving in Yugoslavia s diplomatic corps  While working within the communist system  politicians such as D emal Bijedi   Branko Mikuli  and Hamdija Pozderac reinforced and protected the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina 34  Their efforts proved key during the turbulent period following Tito s death in 1980  and are today considered some of the early steps towards Bosnian independence  However  the republic did not escape the increasingly nationalistic climate of the time  With the fall of the Soviet Union and the start of the break up of Yugoslavia  the old communist doctrine of tolerance began to lose its potency  creating an opportunity for nationalist elements in the society to spread their influence   edit  Bosnian War for independence  1992 1995  Main article

dominated by three ethnically based parties  which had formed a loose coalition to oust the communists from power  35 Croatia and Slovenia s subsequent declarations of independence and the warfare that ensued placed Bosnia and Herzegovina and its three constituent peoples in an awkward position  A significant split soon developed on the issue of whether to stay with the Yugoslav federation  overwhelmingly favored among Serbs  or seek independence  overwhelmingly favored among Bosniaks and Croats   The Serb members of parliament  consisting mainly of the Serb Democratic Party members  abandoned the central parliament in Sarajevo  and formed the Assembly of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 24 October 1991  which marked the end of the tri ethnic coalition that governed after the elections in 1990  This Assembly established the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992  which became Republika Srpska in August 1992  On 18 November 1991  the party

sovereignty on 15 October 1991 was followed by a referendum for independence from Yugoslavia on 29 February and 1 March 1992 boycotted by the great majority of the Serbs  The turnout in the independence referendum was 63 4 per cent and 99 7 per cent of voters voted for independence  39  Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence on 3 March 1992  Following a tense period of escalating tensions the opening shots in the incipient Bosnian conflict were fired when Serb paramilitary forces attacked Bosnian Croat villages around Capljina on 7 March 1992 and around Bosanski Brod and Bosniak town Gorazde on 15 March  These minor attacks were followed by much more serious Serb artillery attacks on Neum on 19 March and on Bosanski Brod on 24 March  The killing of a Bosniak civilian  woman  Suada Dilberovi    on 5 April 1992 by a sniper  while she was demonstrating in Sarajevo against the raising of barricades by Bosnian Serbs  is widely regarded as marking the start of warfare between the three major communities  35  Secret discussions between Franjo Tu man and Slobodan Milo evi  on the division of Bosnia and Herzegovina between Serbia and Croatia were held as early as March 1991 known as Kara or evo agreement  Following the declaration of independence of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina  the Serbs attacked different parts of the country  The state administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina effectively ceased to function having lost control over the entire territory  The Serbs wanted all lands where Serbs had a majority  eastern and western Bosnia  The Croats and their leader Tu man also aimed at securing parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina as Croatian  The policies of the Republic of Croatia and its leader Franjo Tu man towards Bosnia and Herzegovina were never totally transparent and always included Franjo Tu man s ultimate aim of expanding Croatia s borders  Bosnian Muslims  the only ethnic group loyal to the Bosnian government  were an easy target  because the Bosnian government forces were poorly equipped and unprepared for the war  40  International recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina increased diplomatic pressure for the Yugoslav People s Army  JNA  to withdraw from the republic s territory which they officially did  However  in fact  the Bosnian Serb members of JNA simply changed insignia  formed the Army of Republika Srpska  and continued fighting  Armed and equipped from JNA stockpiles in Bosnia  supported by volunteers and various paramilitary forces from Serbia  and receiving extensive humanitarian  logistical and financial support from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  Republika Srpska s offensives in 1992 managed to place much of the country under its control  15  Initially  the Serb forces attacked the non Serb civilian population in Eastern Bosnia  Once towns and villages were securely in their hands  the Serb forces   military  police  the paramilitaries and  sometimes  even Serb villagers   applied the same pattern  Bosniak houses and apartments were systematically ransacked or burnt down  Bosniak civilians were rounded up or captured  and sometimes beaten or killed in the process  2 2 million refugees were displaced by the end of the war  of all three nationalities   41  Men and women were separated  with many of the men detained in the camps  The women and indeed some children  as young as twelve years of age  were kept in various detention centres where they had to live in intolerably unhygienic conditions  where they were mistreated in many ways including being raped repeatedly  Serb soldiers or policemen would come to these detention centres  select one or more women  take them out and rape them  42  In June 1992 the focus switched to Novi Travnik and Gornji Vakuf where the Croat Defence Council  HVO  efforts to gain control were resisted  On 18 June 1992 the Bosnian Territorial Defence in Novi Travnik received an ultimatum from the HVO which included demands to abolish existing Bosnia and Herzegovina institutions  establish the authority of the Croatian Community of Herzeg Bosnia and pledge allegiance to it  subordinate the Territorial Defense to the HVO and expel Muslim refugees  all within 24 hours  The attack was launched on June 19  The elementary school and the Post Office were attacked and damaged  43  Gornji Vakuf was initially attacked by Croats on 20 June 1992  but the attack failed  The Graz agreement caused deep division inside the Croat community and strengthened the separation group  which led to the conflict with Bosniaks  One of the primary pro union Croat leaders  Bla  Kraljevi   leader of the Croatian Defence Forces  HOS  armed group  was killed by HVO soldiers in August 1992  which severely weakened the moderate group who hoped to keep the Bosnian Croat alliance alive  44  The situation became more serious in October 1992 when Croat forces mattacked the Bosniak population in Prozor  According to Jadranko Prli  indictment  HVO forces cleansed most of the Muslims from the town of Prozor and several surrounding villages  36  By 1993  when an armed conflict erupted between the predominantly Bosniak government in Sarajevo and the Croatian Republic of Herzeg Bosnia  about 70  of the country was controlled by Republika Srpska  Ethnic cleansing and civil rights violations against non Serbs were rampant in these areas  DNA teams have been used to collect evidence of the atrocities committed by Serbian forces during these campaigns  45  One single most prominent example is the Srebrenica Massacre  ruled genocide by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia  An estimated 7 000 Bosnians were killed by the Serbian political authorities  46  In March 1994  the signing of the Washington Accords between the leaders of the republican government and Herzeg Bosnia led to the creation of a joint Bosniak Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina  which absorbed the territory of the Croatian Republic of Herzeg Bosnia and that held by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina  The Federation soon liberated the small Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia  A NATO bombing campaign began in August  1995  against the Army of Republika Srpska  after the Srebrenica massacre  Meanwhile  a ground offensive by the allied forces of Croatia and Bosnia  based on the treaty in Split by Tudjman and Izetbegovi   pushed the Serbs away from territories held in western Bosnia which paved the way to negotiations  In December 1995  the signing of the Dayton Agreement in Dayton  Ohio by the presidents of Bosnia and Herzegovina  Alija Izetbegovi    Croatia  Franjo Tu man   and Serbia  Slobodan Milo evi   brought a halt to the fighting  roughly establishing the basic structure of the present day state  A NATO led peacekeeping force was immediately dispatched to Bosnia to enforce the deal  The number of identified victims is currently at 97 207  and the recent research estimates the total number to be less than 110 000 killed  civilians and military   47  48  49  and 1 8 million displaced  This is being addressed by the International Commission on Missing Persons  According to numerous International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia  ICTY  judgments the conflict involved Bosnia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  later Serbia and Montenegro  50  as well as Croatia  51  The Bosnian government charged Serbia of complicity in genocide in Bosnia during the war at the International Court of Justice  ICJ   The ICJ ruling of 26 February 2007 effectively determined the war s nature to be international  though exonerating Serbia of direct responsibility for the genocide committed by Serb forces of Republika Srpska  The ICJ concluded  however  that Serbia failed to prevent genocide committed by Serb forces and failed to punish those who carried out the genocide  especially general Ratko Mladi   and bring them to justice  52 Ratko Mladi  was arrested in a village in northern Serbia on 26 May 2011  being accused of directly orchestrating and overseeing the slaughter of 8 000 Muslim men and boys  amongst other genocide and war crime charges  53  The judges ruled that the criteria for genocide with the specific intent  dolus specialis  to destroy Bosnian Muslims were met only in Srebrenica or Eastern Bosnia in 1995  54  The court concluded that the crimes committed during the 1992 1995 war  may amount to crimes against humanity according to the international law  but that these acts did not  in themselves  constitute genocide  55  The Court further decided that  following Montenegro s declaration of independence in June  2006  Serbia was the only respondent party in the case  but that  any responsibility for past events involved at the relevant time the composite State of Serbia and Montenegro   56   edit  Geography Main article  Geography of Bosnia and Herzegovina See also  List of

932 km 579 mi  to the north and south west  Serbia  302 km 188 mi  to the east  and Montenegro  225 km 140 mi  to the southeast  It lies between latitudes 42  and 46  N  and longitudes 15  and 20  E  The country s name comes from the two regions Bosnia and Herzegovina  which have a very vaguely defined border between them  Bosnia occupies the northern areas which are roughly four fifths of the entire country  while Herzegovina occupies the rest in the south part of the country  The country is mostly mountainous  encompassing the central Dinaric Alps  The northeastern parts reach into the Pannonian basin  while in the south it borders the Adriatic  Dinaric Alps generally run in east west direction  and get higher towards the south  The highest point of the country is peak Magli  at 2 386 m  at the Montenegrin border  Major mountains include Kozara  Grme   Vla i    vrsnica  Prenj  Romanija  Jahorina  Bjela nica and Treskavica  Overall  close to 50  of Bosnia and Herzegovina is forested  Most forest areas are in Central  Eastern and Western parts of Bosnia  Herzegovina has drier Mediterranean climate  with dominant karst topography  Northern Bosnia  Posavina  contains very fertile agricultural land along the river Sava and the corresponding area is heavily farmed  This farmland is a part of the Parapannonian Plain stretching into neighboring Croatia and Serbia  The country has only 20 kilometers  12 mi  of coastline  8  around the town of Neum in the Herzegovina Neretva Canton  Although the city is surrounded by Croatian peninsulas  by the international law  Bosnia has a right of passage to the outer sea  The major cities are the capital Sarajevo  Banja Luka in the northwest region known as Bosanska Krajina  Bijeljina and Tuzla in the northeast  Zenica and Doboj in the central part of Bosnia and Mostar  the capital of Herzegovina  There are seven major rivers in Bosnia and Herzegovina 57  The Sava is the largest river of the country  but it only forms its northern natural border with Croatia  It drains 76  57  of the country s territory into the Danube and the Black Sea  Bosnia and Herzegovina is therefore also a member of the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River  ICPDR   The Una  Sana and Vrbas are right tributaries of Sava river  They are located in the northwestern region of Bosanska Krajina  The Bosna river gave its name to the country  and is the longest river fully contained within it  It stretches through central Bosnia  from its source near Sarajevo to Sava in the north  The Drina flows through the eastern part of Bosnia  and for the most part it forms a natural border with Serbia  The Neretva is the major river of Herzegovina and the only major river that flows south  into the Adriatic Sea  Phytogeographically  Bosnia and Herzegovina belongs to the Boreal Kingdom and is shared between the Illyrian province of the Circumboreal Region and Adriatic province of the Mediterranean Region  According to the WWF  the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina can be subdivided into three ecoregions  the Pannonian mixed forests  Dinaric Mountains mixed forests and Illyrian deciduous forests

 FBiH   Republika Srpska  RS   and Br ko District  BD   Building of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Sarajevo The Presidency Building in central Sarajevo  Bosnia and Herzegovina has several levels of political structuring  according to the Dayton accord  Most important of these levels is the division of the country into two entities  Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina  The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina covers 51  of Bosnia and Herzegovina s total area  while Republika Srpska covers 49   The entities  based largely on the territories held by the two warring sides at the time  were formally established by the Dayton peace agreement in 1995 because of the tremendous changes in Bosnia and Herzegovina s ethnic structure  Since 1996 the power of the entities relative to the State government has decreased significantly  Nonetheless  entities still have numerous powers to themselves  The Br ko District in the north of the country was created in 2000 out of land from both entities  It officially belongs to both  but is governed by neither  and functions under a decentralized system of local government  The Br ko District has been praised for maintaining a multiethnic population and a level of prosperity significantly above the national average  58  The third level of Bosnia and Herzegovina s political subdivision is manifested in cantons  They are unique to the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina entity  which consists of ten of them  All of them have their own cantonal government  which is under the law of the Federation as a whole  Some cantons are ethnically mixed and have special laws implemented to ensure the equality of all constituent people  The fourth level of political division in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the municipalities  The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is divided in 74 municipalities  and Republika Srpska in 63  Municipalities also have their own local government  and are typically based on the most significant city or place in their territory  As such  many municipalities have a long tradition and history with their present boundaries  Some others  however  were only created following the recent war after traditional municipalities were split by the Inter Entity Boundary Line  Each canton in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of several municipalities  which are divided into local communities  Besides entities  cantons  and municipalities  Bosnia and Herzegovina also has four  official  cities  These are  Banja Luka  Mostar  Sarajevo  and East Sarajevo  The territory and government of the cities of Banja Luka and Mostar corresponds to the municipalities of the same name  while the cities of Sarajevo and East Sarajevo officially consist of several municipalities  Cities have their own city government whose power is in between that of the municipalities and cantons  or the entity  in the case of Republika Srpska   As a result of the Dayton Accords  the civilian peace implementation is supervised by the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina selected by the Peace Implementation Council  The High Representative has many governmental and legislative powers  including the dismissal of elected and non elected officials  More recently  several central institutions have been established  such as defense ministry  security ministry  state court  indirect taxation service and so on  in the process of transferring part of the jurisdiction from the entities to the state  The representation of the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina is by elites who represent the country s three major groups  with each having a guaranteed share of power  The Chair of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina rotates among three members  Bosniak  Serb  Croat   each elected as the Chair for an eight month term within their four year term as a member  The three members of the Presidency are elected directly by the people  Federation votes for the Bosniak Croat  Republika Srpska for the Serb   The Chair of the Council of Ministers is nominated by the Presidency and approved by the House of Representatives  He or she is then responsible for appointing a Foreign Minister  Minister of Foreign Trade  and others as appropriate  The Parliamentary Assembly is the lawmaking body in Bosnia and Herzegovina  It consists of two houses  the House of Peoples and the House of Representatives  The House of Peoples has 15 delegates  two thirds of which come from the Federation  5 Croat and 5 Bosniaks  and one third from the Republika Srpska  5 Serbs   The House of Representatives is composed of 42 Members  two thirds elected from the Federation and one third elected from the Republika Srpska  The Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the supreme  final arbiter of legal matters  It is composed of nine members  four members are selected by the House of Representatives of the Federation  two by the Assembly of the Republika Srpska  and three by the President of the European Court of Human Rights after consultation with the Presidency  However  the highest political authority in the country is the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina  the chief executive officer for the international civilian presence in the country  Since 1995  the High Representative has been able to bypass the elected parliamentary assembly  and since 1997 has been able to remove elected officials  The methods selected by the High Representative have been criticized as undemocratic  59  International supervision is to end when the country is deemed politically and democratically stable and self sustaining   edit  Military Main article  Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina Bosnian soldiers armed with Yugoslavian made SKS rifles The Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina were unified into a single entity in 2005  with the merger of the Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Army

policymakers in Bosnia and Herzegovina  as well as the international community  on regional stabilization in the countries successors of the former Yugoslavia  Within Bosnia and Herzegovina  relations with its neighbors of Croatia  Serbia and Montenegro have been fairly stable since the signing of the Dayton Agreement in 1995  On April 23  2010  Bosnia and Herzegovina received the Membership Action

planned economy  One legacy of the previous era is a greatly overstaffed military industry  under former leader Josip Broz Tito  military industries were promoted in the republic  resulting in the development of a large share of Yugoslavia s defense plants but fewer commercially viable firms  For the most of Bosnia s history  agriculture has been based on small and inefficient privately owned farms  food has traditionally been a net import for the republic  65  The war in the 1990s caused a dramatic change in the Bosnian economy  66  GDP fell by 75  and the destruction of physical infrastructure devastated the economy  67  While much of the production capacity has been restored  the Bosnian economy still faces considerable difficulties  Figures show GDP and per capita income
