External links  edit  Plot Main article  List of Chuck episodes Chuck Bartowski  Zachary Levi  is in his late twenties  working at a dead end job as a computer service expert at the Burbank  California Buy More  a large retail consumer electronics chain comparable to Best Buy  with his best friend  Morgan Grimes  Joshua Gomez   Chuck is intelligent  but lacks ambition  His sister Ellie  Sarah Lancaster  and her boyfriend Devon  Captain Awesome  Woodcomb  Ryan McPartlin  are doctors who are constantly encouraging Chuck to make progress in his professional and romantic life  Bryce Larkin  Matthew Bomer   Chuck s former Stanford University roommate and now Central Intelligence Agency  CIA  agent  steals the Intersect  the entire merged database of the CIA and National Security Agency  NSA   and destroys the computer storing it  The sole surviving copy becomes subliminally embedded in Chuck s brain via encoded images when he opens an email from Bryce  The NSA s Major John Casey  Adam Baldwin  and CIA Agent Sarah Walker  Yvonne Strahovski  are dispatched to investigate  Chuck is recruited to use the knowledge he now possesses to help thwart assassins and international terrorists  upending his previously mundane life  The Intersect causes Chuck to receive involuntary  flashes  of information from the database  activated by triggers such as faces  voices  objects  and keywords  In order to protect his family and friends  Chuck must keep his second occupation a secret  Casey and Walker are assigned to watch over Chuck  They are forced to establish an uneasy alliance and cover identities  Walker poses as Chuck s girlfriend and takes a job at a fast food restaurant near the Buy More  while Casey reluctantly becomes part of the Buy More sales team  The main antagonists driving the plot are a series of rogue spy cabals  first internal to the United States intelligence community and then global in scope  and a core part of the threat is the danger of the Intersect being either captured  making Chuck as much a liability as an asset to the government  or replicated  making Chuck obsolete or outmatched by less scrupulous spies  Chuck  Sarah and Casey all face professional conflicts as they grow to respect each other  and a genuine romantic interest develops between Chuck and Sarah  Chuck s desire to maintain his close relationships and eventually return to a normal life is challenged by the dangers and growing responsibilities of his secret life  and he gradually becomes a more competent  confident and willing spy  In the course of events  Chuck unravels mysteries from his life before the series  often dealing with the Intersect  why his parents left  why Bryce got him kicked out of Stanford  and why he s unusually suited for the Intersect  Meanwhile  Casey and Sarah confront unresolved issues from their lives before the series  including their families  Sarah s history with Bryce  and the spies they previously worked with  And as Chuck grows more comfortable with his own role  those closest to him are gradually drawn into his spy life   edit  Cast and characters Main article  List of Chuck characters See also  List of

initially given a put pilot commitment by NBC before a pilot order was green lit by the network in January 2007  12  Schwartz and Fedak both attended the University of Southern California and the latter pitched the idea to Schwartz who agreed to develop the project with him  13 Joseph McGinty Nichol  Schwartz s fellow executive producer on The O C   directed the first hour of the series and consequently became an executive producer via his production company  Wonderland Sound and Vision  Fedak  Peter Johnson  Scott Rosenbaum  Matthew Miller and Allison Adler also serve as co executive producers  14  NBC gave the series an early pick up and a thirteen episode order on May 10  2007  15  On November 26  2007  TV Guide reported that NBC had picked up the series for a full  22 episode season  16   edit  Casting Zachary Levi and Adam Baldwin were the first two to be cast in February 2007 in the roles of Chuck Bartowski and veteran NSA agent Major John Casey  respectively  Fedak always had Baldwin in mind for the role of John Casey and the producers found that the actor was a  perfect fit  for the character during the first casting session  13  17  Relative newcomer Yvonne Strahovski was chosen for the female lead role of what was then CIA officer Sarah Kent in the same month  18  Casting continued throughout March with Sarah Lancaster  Joshua Gomez  and Natalie Martinez landing the parts of Dr  Ellie Bartowski  Chuck s older sister   Morgan Pace  Chuck s best friend   and Kayla Hart  Chuck s neighbor and love interest   respectively  19  The Kayla Hart character was dropped before filming because creators Chris Fedak and Josh Schwartz found it unlikely and too complicated to the storyline that two women would be pining over Chuck  Morgan s surname was later changed to  Grimes  and Sarah s surname was changed to  Walker    edit  Filming locations Although Chuck s apartment is set in Echo Park  the pilot was shot in El Cabrillo in Hollywood  After the series was picked up  the apartment and the building s courtyard were re created on a Warner Bros  soundstage  20  Aerial views throughout the show combine shots of Echo Park and El Cabrillo  The exterior shots of the Burbank Buy More where Chuck and Morgan work are of a former Mervyn s store in the Fallbrook Mall in Canoga Park  21   edit  Reception  edit  Ratings U S  viewers for each episode in the series  broken down into its five seasons  Despite heavy promotion from NBC and positive critical reviews  Chuck has suffered in domestic ratings due to stiff competition of established hits from ABC  Dancing with the Stars   FOX  House   and CBS  How I Met Your Mother  Rules of Engagement  in the Monday 8 00 9 00 pm ET timeslot  Its ratings have also been affected by the 2007 2008 Writers Guild of America strike in the first season and President Barack Obama s prime time news conference that led to the show being preempted for a week in the second season  shortly after NBC had done heavy promotion for the show around the Super Bowl  In May 2010  it was reported that Chuck ranked in the top 20 TV shows in the SocialSenseTV ratings report of social media interactions  measuring posts and reads on forums  blogs  and other social media over a three month period  22  Season Timeslot  EDT  Season premiere Season finale TV season Rank U S  viewers in millions 1 Monday 8

reception Early reviews for Chuck were strong  Rolling Stone magazine included the show on its fall 2007  We Like to Watch  list  saying the show  wipes the floor with the other fall debuts   29 Chuck landed on USA Today s list of the  10 Picks for 2007   and they called Levi s performance  incredibly winning   giving the comedy three out of four stars  30  31 Chuck drew numerous comparisons to another critically acclaimed comedy that debuted in Fall 2007 Reaper which also starred a twenty something underachiever who works in a large retail   big box  store  Work Bench  and is drawn into heroism against his will  29  30  32  33  As 2008 drew to a close  the show received further critical acclaim  In December of that year Time magazine named the show one of the top 10 TV series of the year  34  It also made the year end top 10 list of the Chicago Tribune  35 Television Without Pity s list of TV Shows We Wish More People Watched  36 The Star Ledger s Top TV shows of 2008   4   37 The Miami Herald s TV s Top 5 list  38 The New York Observer s Top 10 TV Shows of the Year   6   39  and the Pittsburgh Post Gazette mentions Chuck as one of the few bright spots in television in 2008  40  The Chicago Tribune s Maureen Ryan wrote that  the show pays attention to the mechanics of storytelling and doesn t just try to coast on the comedy   She continued    Given  the level of attention paid to all those other things emotion  suspense  plotting  character Chuck ends up being one of the TV scene s greatest pleasures at the moment   41 Television Without Pity s Angel Cohn finds Chuck to be a well written show  saying  it features some of the smartest and most quick witted dialogue on TV   She praises the ensemble cast and notes  while the first season was good  this show has really hit its stride in its second season   42  James Poniewozik of Time magazine says the show is a  delight  and that with the second season the  new episodes quickly jump back in  with higher stakes and sharper jokes   43 The Star Ledger s Alan Sepinwall calls Chuck  the most purely entertaining show currently on television  whether you re talking network or cable   44  He states that  what makes Chuck so special     is that there s a fundamental warmth and humanity underneath the jokes   with  a cast of appealing characters played by very good actors   45  Going into 2010  Aaron Barnhart of the Kansas City Star described the show s premise as  fresh  appealing and limited   expressing concern that  a lot of TV shows overstay their welcome  and fearing that in its third season the show is  about to run out of new  workable ideas   46 USA Today called the show NBC s  best scripted hour   47  However  SLANT Magazine bemoaned Season 3 s reinstatement of Chuck and Sarah s relationship  saying  as it stands the situation with Chuck and Sarah is worn down  tired  and typical   though he added  with a show as genuinely enjoyable as Chuck  status quo is far from a death sentence   48   edit  Awards Season 1 of Chuck enjoyed much formal recognition  The program was mentioned multiple times in IGN s 2007 year in review awards  Along with winning the honor of Best New TV Series  Sarah Walker won the award for best TV character  and Chuck and Sarah as a couple won the  Couple That We Rooted for the Most  award  Chuck was also nominated for  Best New TV Comedy Series

series to be renewed by NBC for the 2008 2009 television season  Chuck was classified as a show  on the bubble  between renewal and cancellation in April 2009 after NBC decided to delay its decision on its renewal for a third season until early May  56  57  58  The show s second season did not improve on or maintain the audience numbers received in the first season and has consistently obtained low ratings  making it one of the least watched shows in its Monday 8 00 pm ET timeslot  57  Concerned that the show would not be renewed for a third season  fans launched a  Save Chuck  campaign that gained momentum with the use of social networking websites like Twitter and Facebook  59  Fansite ChuckTV net launched the first organized fan effort  the Watch Buy Share campaign  an idea thought up by  Chuck  vs the podcast  founder Gray Jones   on March 18  2009  a letter writing campaign was later added to the effort  60  The week of April 6  2009  television blogger Kath Skerry changed the name of her website GiveMeMyRemote com to GiveMeMyChuck com and used Twitter to notify her readers to support the show  prompting television columnists Alan Sepinwall of The Star Ledger  Maureen Ryan of Chicago Tribune and Josef Adalian of TelevisionWeek to write Chuck related news on their websites and Twitter feeds  61  Sepinwall also wrote an open letter to NBC on reasons for renewal  while Ryan encouraged fan support by listing the various ways in which they could contribute to the campaign to save Chuck  62  63  One fan  Wendy Farrington  was inspired by a product placement in second season episodes to organize a campaign to purchase  Footlong  submarine sandwiches from Subway on the air date of the second season finale  64  This movement gained support from various cast and crew members  with actor Zachary Levi seen leading hundreds of fans to a Subway restaurant in Birmingham  England  59  65  Members of the show s cast and crew participated in a special  rally cry  episode of Chuck vs the Podcast on April 24  2009  just before the season finale  to encourage fans to keep the campaign going and thank them for their support  66  On the campaign  co creator Josh Schwartz remarked that it  has been one of the most amazing experiences of  his  life to witness and certainly the most creatively gratifying   67  Other fan efforts include the  Have a Heart  Renew Chuck  campaign  involving Chuck fans donating money to the American Heart Association on behalf of NBC  68  69  By the NBC upfront on May 19  2009 over  17 000 was raised  70  71  The campaign also prompted press and media coverage  with The Hollywood Reporter calling Chuck the  most discussed bubble show online   72  Linda Holmes  writing for NPR  noted the support the campaign has received from both fans and critics  and comments   It s very common for chasms to open between critics and viewers    But here  critics find themselves passionately advocating for something that s extraordinarily enjoyable to watch   73  James Poniewozik of Time magazine wrote about the efficacy of save this show columns and fan protests  saying   The sad fact of advertising supported television is that  unlike cable  it still rewards breadth  not depth  of viewership  Four million people who watch a show really hard are still just four million people to an ad buyer  Unless they spend money   74  He stated that the  Finale  amp  Footlong  campaign was a far more effective way to demonstrate support since Subway is one of the show s major sponsors  74  However  Josh Bernoff of Advertising Age remarks   Thousands of visible  loyal viewers does not equal millions of actual viewers  Objects in the groundswell may be smaller than they appear  People who congregate online are not a representative sample   75  In support of the show  Nestl  sent more than 1 000 packs of its Wonka Nerds candy to NBC after Josh Schwartz made such a suggestion to fans in an April 20  2009 interview with The New York Times  76  77  Additionally  Chuck won the annual  Save Our Shows  poll by USA Today in which 43 000 people voted  topping the poll with 54  of respondents favoring renewal  beating other bubble shows such as Cold Case  45   and Without a Trace  41    78  The petition campaigns were also mentioned on the May 12  2009 episode of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart  79  NBC s decision to renew the show for a thirteen episode third season was announced on May 17  2009  5  Both NBC s Ben Silverman and co creator Chris Fedak have confirmed that the option remains for a pickup of nine more episodes  80  Although Silverman has claimed that NBC is not looking to lower costs  Schwartz has stated that series production studio Warner Bros  Television had asked the producers to make budget cuts to meet a decrease in the license fee by NBC  81  Silverman  Fedak and Schwartz have all stated that the show s quality will not be impacted  80  81  On October 28  2009  numerous media sources began to run reports that NBC had picked up an additional six episodes  82  83   edit  Series renewal  2010 This section may be confusing or unclear to readers  Please help clarify the section  suggestions may be found on the talk page   April 2010  Questions about the series  continued viability began before the third season aired  Just hours before the third season premiere  when asked whether NBC suddenly moving Jay Leno out of primetime lowered the bar for Chuck  NBC chairman Jeff Gaspin replied   I wouldn t say the bar s lower  but we obviously have less choice at the moment  so he s got a better shot   84  When asked about the series  chances of being renewed for a fourth season and whether fans would have to step in again  Angela Bromstad replied   Well  it s got to maintain  and it depends on development   but said that the show is a  pleasant surprise  and they re doing great work   85  The ratings for Chuck slipped  falling to a series low 1 9 demo for two weeks running as of the 11th episode of the season   Chuck Versus the Final Exam   The  TV By The Numbers  website reported on March 23  2010 that this was  below the ratings level that would indicate likely renewal now  despite the overall ratings difficulties that NBC was facing  86  However  on March 30  2010  the season s 12th episode   Chuck Versus the American Hero  saw an increase to a 2 1 share and a 0 2 million viewer rise  87  Chuck was also a contestant in E  s online Save One Show contest for the second year running  where it won with 52  of the vote  The runner up was One Tree
