Smith  The earliest story to be written and drawn  by Len Wein and Neal Adams  featuring the character was intended to appear in Savage Tales  2  July 1971   but the series was canceled  a  2 and subsequent series appeared much later  and new homes were found for the stories in the ensuing months  In subsequent publications creators including Roy Thomas  Len Wein  Neal Adams  Mike Friedrich

Fictional character biography  edit  First appearances The character s first appearance  Art by Barry Smith and Bill Everett  The character who later becomes Mockingbird first appears in a short sequence in Astonishing Tales  6  June 1971  in which a frantic young brunette arrives at the English country estate of Lord Kevin Plunder  who is also known as  Ka Zar    Encountering the butler she exclaims  Lord Kevin Plunder where is he  I must speak with him   tis a matter     of the fate of worlds    In a brief second appearance in the same issue the character claims  Lord Kevin Plunder and I have never met   and yet I feel that I know him       You see  I can     can  feel  people in my mind  And I know that unless I speak with him     Lord Kevin will die    1  Whatever writer Gerry Conway s original ideas were for this character  subsequent creators developed her to such a degree that she is unrecognisable as this earlier figure  In particular  no later story makes reference to the psychic abilities that these quotes appear to allude to  After this story Roy Thomas took over writing the Ka Zar strip and in his first story the as yet unnamed character makes another brief appearance  The butler at Ka Zar s estate informs her that his employer is currently in the Savage Land  The girl then vows to  walk the Savage Land  for   Ka Zar s  sake and the sake of the world   2  In Astonishing Tales  8  Oct  1971  Thomas is joined by co writer Gary Friedrich and the character begins to develop   her hair color changes to blonde without explanation and her name is given as  Barbara   3  In this issue Ka Zar comes upon the site of a plane crash in the Savage Land and encounters a survivor  This man explains that he and his fianc e Barbara flew to the Savage Land to seek Ka Zar out  He mentions that Barbara learned of Ka Zar s whereabouts from the butler at the Plunder Estate  clearly indicating that Barbara is meant to be the same character as the brunette from the previous two issues  Barbara is shown later in the story  having parachuted from the plane before the crash she is rescued by a group of World War 2 veterans who have been trapped in the Savage Land for decades  Gerry Conway briefly returned to co write  with Roy Thomas  Barbara s next appearance where she finally meets Ka Zar and is reunited with her fianc   whose name is revealed as  Paul    4  In the following issue  written by Thomas alone  Ka Zar leads the two characters through the dangerous Savage Land  5  Astonishing Tales  12  June 1972  is a key early appearance for the character  due in part to Marvel s decision to feature Man Thing in this issue  At this point Man Thing had made only one previous appearance  in the 1971 black and white magazine Savage Tales  1  6  A follow up 7 page Man Thing story by writer Len Wein and artist Neal Adams was commissioned for a version of Savage Tales  2 that was ultimately never published  7  Finally seeing print in Astonishing Tales  12 the sequence is presented as a flashback and an interlude between the main action of the book  Dr  Barbara Morse as she appears in writer Len Wein and artist Neal Adams   Man Thing   story  One of the characters in the Wein Adams story is a blonde female scientist called  Dr  Barbara Morse   Morse is working on a research project in the Florida Everglades called Project  Gladiator  which is an attempt to replicate the Super Soldier serum which was used to create Captain America  This is the same research which Ted Sallis had previously been working on when a flawed serum transformed him into the Man Thing  In the story Morse is abducted by AIM thugs and is later liberated through the intervention of the Man Thing  8  Framing the flashback is a sequence of newer material by writer Roy Thomas and artist John Buscema in which Barbara  now revealed to be  Dr  Barbara Morse  and thus the character from the Wein Adams Man Thing story  and Paul  now  Dr  Paul Allen   accompany Ka Zar back to the United States and explain that they sought him out so that he could help them deal with the problems surrounding the appearance of the Man Thing in Florida  9  In the next issue the storyline is wrapped up and Paul reveals he is a double agent working for A I M  It is also revealed for the first time that Barbara has connections with S H I E L D   the spy agency asked her to pretend to love Allen to  learn what  she  could  10  about his activities with AIM  At the story s end Paul dies at the hands of the Man Thing and Barbara expresses the hope that she can  go back to just being a scientist again   10   edit  Bobbi Morse  Agent 19 of S H I E L D  Mike Friedrich took over from Roy Thomas to become writer of Astonishing Tales with  15  Dec  1972   He introduces a new status quo in which Ka Zar is living in New York and  lady biologist  and S H I E L D  agent Barbara  who now prefers to be called  Bobbi   Morse is his constant companion  11  Bobbi Morse  Agent 19 of S H I E L D  Art by Mike Royer  Friedrich remained the writer of the various color Ka Zar series for the next two years 12  13  and for most of that period he continued to feature Morse as Ka Zar s sidekick and occasional love interest  In these stories she is depicted as a fully trained S H I E L D  agent  Contemptuous of his jungle origins  she is Ka Zar s escort to the city and modern life  Together she and Ka Zar tackle threats such as the Pusher  14 Gemini  15 Victorius  16  17  18 Gog  16  and the Plunderer  15  16  As the series progresses she begins to wear a regular costume of tinted glasses  a red one piece  and boots  Her S H I E L D  designation of  Agent 19  is revealed 16  and she and Ka Zar finally kiss  19  In 1974 the color Ka Zar series left Astonishing Tales and was relaunched in the Ka Zar  Lord of the Hidden Jungle title  The strip is set once again in the Savage Land and Morse is absent for the first story  She returns in the third issue   explaining that Nick Fury had sent her on a S H I E L D  assignment to look into  El Tigre   a subversive who is exploiting the energy crisis in South America  20  This leads her to reluctantly travel back to the Savage Land  where she and Ka Zar defeat El Tigre and his ally Man God together  21  The introduction of Shanna the She Devil into Ka Zar s supporting cast 22  changes Morse s role in the stories of this period  Ka Zar expresses clear attraction to the more jungle friendly Shanna from the outset 23  and Morse is cast as the secondary love interest  This dynamic is most notable in Morse s lone appearance in the Ka Zar strip in the black and white magazine Savage Tales   8  Jan  1975   Written by Gerry Conway  the story depicts Morse leading Shanna and a group of S H I E L D  agents into the Savage Land where they work with Ka Zar to neutralise a threat to world security  During the course of the adventure Morse realises that Ka Zar s affections lie with Shanna  24  This story  first published in late 1974  is the last in which Morse appears as a Ka Zar supporting character   edit  Huntress to Mockingbird The debut of the  Huntress   Art by George Evans  A year later Mike Friedrich returned to the character in a 20 page story with art by George Evans  Published in the one shot black and white magazine Marvel Super Action  1  Jan  1976  the story is the first in which Morse appears as a costumed super heroine and lead protagonist  While operating as a S H I E L D  agent she is recruited by a United States Senator to look into corruption in a Latin American branch of the espionage organisation  To complete her mission she  drops out  of S H I E L D  and takes on the superhero identity of the  Huntress   25  In a text piece in Marvel Super Action  1 editor Archie Goodwin explained how Morse came to be used for this story   I suggested the title   Huntress   and the notion of using S H I E L D  to writer Mike Friedrich  He decided to draw upon a character he d helped develop while scripting the color Ka Zar comic  and wound up revamping her totally  With a bit of kibitzing from Mike and myself  artist George Evans designed the lady s costume and we were in business  26    Marvel Super Action was originally designed as a bi monthly publication  but the economic recession of the mid 1970s forced Marvel to scale back their plans and the magazine was published as a one off  26  This meant that the plot of Huntress  originally planned as a two parter  26  had to be condensed before publication and no follow up stories by the same creators were ever produced  Morse s next published appearance was Marvel Team Up  95  July  1980  in which she dons a new costume and finally takes on the alias  Mockingbird   27  This story explains that she has continued to look into corruption in S H I E L D  and in doing so has come to be hunted by the organisation which mistakes her for a criminal  Teaming up with Spider Man  and with assistance from S H I E L D  director Nick Fury  Mockingbird confronts Carl Delanden  a corrupt S H I E L D  branch director  In the ensuing battle she is shot by S H I E L D  agents who are following a previous order to subdue her at any cost  The story ends with an unconscious  badly injured but exonerated Mockingbird left in the care of Nick Fury  In the letter s column of that issue the series  then assistant editor Mark Gruenwald explained the creative origins of this new iteration of Bobbi Morse     Where did this Mockingbird come from   some of you may be asking  After all it isn t every day that a new super heroine is premiered in Marvel Team Up  Well the story behind her creation is this  when I had been writing the Spider Woman book one of my chief objectives was to build up a rogue s gallery that S W could call her own  One of several characters I conceived and designed was Mockingbird  Showing the sketch to Steven Grant  writer about town  he helped me work out her powers and weaponry  Well I never got round to doing a Mockingbird story before I left Spider Woman  so I put the idea on the back burner   Time passed  and Steven was searching for something new and different to do in Team Up  He was toying with the idea some of us have had to revamp the Bobbi Morse character  of Ka Zar and Super Action fame   Somehow we got the notion to amalgamate the two concepts and make Bobbi Morse the Mockingbird  Anyone venture a guess why we abandoned the  Huntress  moniker   All that was necessary was to change her hair and skin color since the original M B  was going to be black  So that s the story behind the story  28    The reference to the  why we abandoned the   Huntress  moniker  is a nod to the fact that Marvel s rival DC Comics had debuted a character with the same name in the interim between Marvel Super Action  1 and Marvel Team Up  95  DC s  Huntress   originally the superhero daughter of the Batman and Catwoman of Earth Two  debuted in All Star Comics  69 and DC Super Stars  17  both Dec  1977    edit  Mockingbird and Hawkeye Mockingbird encounters Hawkeye  Art by Mark Gruenwald  The character next appeared in Gruenwald s 1983 4 issue Hawkeye miniseries  29  Fully recovered from her injuries  Mockingbird investigates corruption at Cross Technological Enterprises  where Clint Barton Hawkeye works as security chief  Though the two initially come into conflict with each other  they end up co operating to fight the villain Crossfire and by the series end they are shown to be seriously romantically involved  having eloped together to the Pocono Mountains and apparently married  30  The miniseries reveals how Morse originally became involved with S H I E L D  recounting how she left her biology studies at Georgia Tech to follow her  favorite prof  31  Wilma Calvin on the government s Project  Gladiator  The research project was partly sponsored by S H I E L D  which led Morse to enroll in their spy school and graduate at the top of her class  It is also revealed that she spent six months convalescing in a private hospital after the injuries she suffered in Marvel Team Up  95  31  Gruenwald was editor of the Avengers title in late 1983 when writer Roger Stern began to feature Hawkeye and Mockingbird as members of the series supporting cast  32  In a short period Mockingbird moves back into Avengers Mansion with Barton as he returns to active duty  32  she is formally introduced to the team as his wife  33  the Vision then proposes that Hawkeye and Mockingbird establish a second Avengers team on the west coast  34  and the two move out to Los Angeles  35   edit  West Coast Avengers This leads in to the 1984 4 issue West Coast Avengers limited series  also written by Stern and edited by Gruenwald  In this series Mockingbird becomes a full fledged Avenger as she assists her husband in setting up a new branch of the organization  36  West Coast Avengers became a regular series in 1985 and Steve Englehart  the series writer for its first 42 issues  featured Mockingbird heavily as one of the main cast members of the book  A year into the series Mockingbird begins to wear a modified version of her original costume  designed by series artist Al Milgrom  37  Mockingbird debuts her second costume  Art by Al Milgrom and Joe Sinnott  Over the latter course of his run  Englehart developed a storyline in which the relationship between Hawkeye and Mockingbird is put under serious strain  When the West Coast Avengers are transported to the old west of 1876 the Phantom Rider  Lincoln Slade  abducts  drugs  and brainwashes Mockingbird into forgetting her original life and convinces her she is in love with Slade  and by implication  raping her   After breaking free of his control  Mockingbird seeks revenge on the Rider  and is shown allowing him to plunge to his death off of a cliff  38  Hawkeye learns that Mockingbird let the Phantom Rider die  and harshly disapproves of her actions which leads Mockingbird to leave both Hawkeye and the Avengers  39  For a time she and ex Avengers Tigra and Moon Knight operate as a small fighting unit and together they have various adventures including a battle with the High Evolutionary 40  and an encounter with the modern day Phantom Rider who is possessed by his 19th century ancestor  41  In one story Mockingbird s arrest of the Digger causes a rift between the West Coast Avengers and the Night Shift  42  Mockingbird later reconciles with the no longer possessed Phantom Rider  43  John Byrne became writer and artist of West Coast Avengers in 1989 and in his first story Mockingbird returns and admits to inadvertently betraying the team  44  She later explains that she was duped by a group who claimed to be connected to S H I E L D  into revealing security information about their headquarters for a  contingency  plan to neutralise the Vision in the event that he should try to take over the world once again  In fact the plan is put into operation immediately and when Mockingbird realises this she rushes to the West Coast Avenger s headquarters only to arrive too late  the group having already abducted and dismantled the android  45  The group is revealed to be a consortium of international security services and though the Vision is eventually restored his memory and personality are erased  46  Later Mockingbird tracks down Clint Barton  Hawkeye  and makes an attempt at reconciliation  admitting that she still loves him  During their discussion Barton reveals that they had previously decided to divorce  47  Hawkeye and Mockingbird then travel to Milwaukee to look in to the appearance of a group calling themselves the  Great Lakes Avengers   Upon investigation the couple decides to stay in Milwaukee to train the amateur superhero group and work on their relationship  47  Mockingbird s next regular appearances are as a supporting character in the Hawkeye strip in Avengers Spotlight  in a storyline written by Steve Gerber in which she aids her husband as he takes on the Los Angeles Asian crime lord Lotus  48   edit  Avengers West Coast Mockingbird apparently dies  Art by Dave Ross and Tim Dzon  Roy Thomas returned to writing the character when he and his wife Dann became co writers of the rechristened Avengers West Coast title in 1990  Mockingbird first makes a brief reappearance in the title when she attends an Avengers West Coast team meeting and stands for election to return to the team  being voted in as an  alternate member   effectively a reserve member   Hawkeye  who is already a full member  having returned to the series a year earlier  admits he did not vote for her and describes her as his  estranged wife   Mockingbird then returns to Detroit  49  In a later storyline Morse contacts Barton and states that she is returning to Los Angeles from Detroit to discuss matters with him  50  She is then reunited with her husband while he is in the field as Hawkeye  joining him and the Avengers West Coast on a mission 51  after which Mockingbird begins to once again make regular appearances as a cast member of the book  Mockingbird later reveals to Hawkeye that their divorce is almost final 52  and Ultron abducts her and uses her thought patterns and personality to create his second robotic  wife  Alkhema  53  the two rekindling their romance after she is liberated  53  However  the originally intended interpretation of some of these events is changed by a story that is published 17 years later  New Avengers  The Reunion  2  May 2009  asserts that just prior to her abduction by Ultron  Mockingbird was replaced by a Skrull impersonator  and thus the  Mockingbird  who appears between Avengers West Coast vol  1   89 90  Dec  1992 Jan  1993  and Secret Invasion  8  Jan  2009  should no longer be considered the genuine article  54  The reconciliation between Hawkeye and Mockingbird is short lived as in late 1993 Thomas has the character sacrifice her life to save her husband from Mephisto in the centennial issue of Avengers West Coast  55  56  The Avengers West Coast title was canceled two issues later  The storyline depicted how the team  reeling from the events surrounding Mockingbird s death  is ultimately forced to disband  57   edit  Post death In 1998 writer Kurt Busiek briefly revived the character in the Avengers volume 3 series where she appears as a reanimated corpse  a member of the Legion of the Unliving  part of the Grim Reaper s plot to destroy the Avengers  58  In 1999 s Thunderbolts Annual 2000 writers Busiek and Fabian Nicieza have Mockingbird send a message from the afterlife which results in the resurrection of Hellcat  59  In the subsequent Hellcat limited series by writer Steve Englehart  Mockingbird is depicted fighting endless battles in Hell  60  Her reasons for being in Hell are unclear  though she denies it is due to her previous refusal to save the Phantom Rider  hinting that her presence in Hell is serving some purpose  The character next appears is in the tongue in cheek 2006 X Statix Presents  Dead Girl miniseries by writer Peter Milligan  In this series she is depicted as residing in Heaven  where she is an active member of a book club that also includes Dead Girl  Gwen Stacy and Moira MacTaggert  She is recruited by Doctor Strange and Dead Girl to help defeat Mr  Pitiful and his group of resurrected supervillains  She returns to Heaven at the series conclusion and no reference is made to her previous appearances in Hell  61   edit  Return Mockingbird and Clint Barton are reunited  Art by Leinil Francis Yu and Mark Morales  In a 2009 interview Marvel editor and writer Jim McCann revealed how the decision to resurrect Mockingbird was made creatively    About a year and a half ago  we were planning the ending for Secret Invasion and with one character we wanted to get back something that the Skrulls would have taken away  There were a couple of characters on the list for that  but Mockingbird was the one I fought for the most  and as  Secret Invasion series writer  Brian  Bendis  has pointed out  I said that they were like the Mr   amp  Mrs  Smith of the Marvel Universe  He was like   That sounds great  We can use that   62    Bendis first teases at Mockingbird s return when at the beginning of Secret Invasion a spaceship crash lands in the Savage Land and a large group of superheroes emerges from the wreckage  among whom is a character who looks exactly like Mockingbird  63  All the members of this group present themselves as the genuine article   they claim that at some point in the past they were each abducted and replaced by Skrull imposters  the Skrulls being a race of alien shape shifters  Clint Barton  who is present at the scene  and at this point goes by the code name  Ronin   believes this  Mockingbird  s claims to be his wife because she is able to tell him the significance of the date  October 12  to their relationship  The date would have been the birthday of the couple s  previously unmentioned  miscarried child  which   it is explained   was conceived at some point during their joint career as Avengers  64  Barton initially defends this  Mockingbird  from the suspicions of other superheroes  but when she is revealed to be a Skrull imposter he kills her in a fit of rage  65  Later in the series Iron Man finds a Skrull ship in orbit which genuinely contains various individuals who had been abducted and replaced by the Skrulls  The real Mockingbird is revealed to be among them and she tearfully reunites with Barton  66  In a subsequent issue of Avengers  The Initiative writers Christos Gage and Dan Slott include Mockingbird among a group of Skrull abductees who attend a support meeting about their experience  67   edit  Back in action After the character s return in Secret Invasion  Bendis began to use Mockingbird regularly in the New Avengers title  She joins the team 68   in which her husband  still using the code name  Ronin   is also a member   and with them she fights the Hood s gang of super villains  69  learns Spider Man s true identity  70  and battles Dormammu  71  Mockingbird s 2009 new look  Art by David Lopez  Mockingbird gains a new costume in 2009 s New Avengers  The Reunion miniseries  which was pencilled by David Lopez and Jo Chen and written by the editor and writer who had previously advocated for Morse s return  Jim McCann  The plot of the series involves Mockingbird and Clint Barton Ronin teaming up to take on A I M  Scientist Supreme Monica Rappaccini  During the story Morse reveals that she and a group of fellow former S H I E L D  agents who were also Skrull abductees have formed a new espionage organisation   the  World Counter terrorism Agency  or  W C A    the abbreviation being a nod to Barton and Morse s former  West Coast Avengers  team   72  This series also reveals that Mockingbird was replaced by a Skrull just prior to her abduction by Ultron  54  This is a plot point in the series as it establishes that prior to her abduction Barton and Morse were in the process of being divorced and so she is technically no longer married to him  By the story s conclusion they rekindle their relationship  though they decide to remain unmarried  In one subsequent New Avengers storyline Mockingbird is the only member left standing when a device invented by Jonas Harrow inhibits the rest of her teammates superpowers  73  Morse is forced to fight the entire Wrecking Crew alone in Times Square and is eventually defeated by them  74  However she later returns to the scene with an Avengers Quinjet to rescue her colleagues  75  Another plotline involves Clint Barton Ronin vowing to kill Norman Osborn  Morse and the other New Avengers object to the idea so Barton attempts the assassination alone and in secret  He ultimately fails and is captured by the Dark Avengers 76  leading Mockingbird to mount a rescue mission with her New Avengers colleagues Spider Woman  Jewel  and Ms  Marvel which eventually successfully liberates Barton  77  In March 2010 Marvel announced that a new Hawkeye  amp  Mockingbird ongoing series would be launched in June 2010  The title will be produced by the New Avengers  The Reunion creative team of writer Jim McCann and artist David Lopez  Promotional interviews have revealed that the premise of the series involves her and Clint Barton  who has once again taken the code name  Hawkeye   working together as agents of the World Counter terrorism Agency  They are both also still members of the New Avengers  78  79  80  81  although Barton soon leaves the team because he prefers to work on the main Avengers team  saying that he was only with the New Avengers to spend time with his wife  82  During a raid on a warehouse that is revealed to be the location of H A M M E R  s attempt to reorganize after the defeat of Norman Osborn  Bobbi is mortally injured in a shooting despite Spider Man s attempts to save her  83  forcing her teammates to evacuate her to the hospital  84  While Mockingbird lies in hospital in critical condition  Nick Fury contacts the team and gives her a top secret serum that was created by the Germans in 1959 and has recently been rediscovered by the H A M M E R  agents  a combination of the Super Soldier Serum that turned Steve Rogers into Captain America  and the Infinity Formula that retarded Fury s aging  The Formula saves her life  but Nick warns the New Avengers that he cannot predict the consequences of turning Mockingbird into a combination of himself and Rogers  85  After being injected with the Formula during the Fear Itself storyline  Mockingbird makes a quick and complete recovery from her injury  and now exhibits powers similar to Steve Rogers  She is quite relieved and happy to be alive  and fights the Serpent s forces in New York with vigor  However  after she witnesses Avengers Tower fall  her feelings of happiness are sobered  and she vows to defeat Sin  86   edit  Abilities and equipment While she has no superpowers  Mockingbird is a trained S H I E L D  agent who graduated at the top of her class 31  and as such she can be expected to be proficient in several forms of hand to hand combat and familiar with a wide range of weapons  The character usually uses a pair of batons which can be combined to form a single b  staff in combat  weapons which she has been shown to be an expert with  54  She also possesses a PhD in biology  9  31  To cope with a mortal injury she sustained in a mission  Mockingbird was injected with an experimental serum combining the Super Soldier Serum that gave Captain America his strength and the Infinity Formula that has retarded Nick Fury s aging  The obvious consequence of this was that her injuries were healed  but Fury admitted his uncertainty about the formula s long term consequences on her biology  Thus far  however  she has exhibited greatly enhanced physical strength and agility
