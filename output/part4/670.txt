Cura ao  Dutch  Land Cura ao  4  Papiamentu  Pais K rsou 5    which includes the main island plus the small  uninhabited island of Klein Cura ao   Little Cura ao    is a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands  Its capital is Willemstad  Cura ao is the largest and most populous of the three ABC islands  for Aruba  Bonaire  and Cura ao  of the Lesser Antilles  specifically the Leeward Antilles  It has a land area of 444 square kilometres  171 square miles   As of 1 January 2009  it had a population of 141 766  6  Prior to 10 October 2010  when the Netherlands Antilles was

debated  The explanation gathering more consensus among the Portuguese and the Spanish is that the word derives from the Portuguese word for the state of becoming cured  cura  o   The reason for this is that sailors travelling for months in the sea would often contract scurvy  It appears that in one of such long travels  a group of Portuguese sailors landed for the first time in Cura  o and were cured from scurvy  probably after eating fruit with vitamin C  The island was known from then on as Ilha da Cura  o  Island of Healing   Another explanation is that it is derived from the Portuguese word for heart  cora  o   referring to the island as a centre in trade  Spanish traders took the name over as Cura ao  which was followed by the Dutch  Another explanation is that Cura ao was the name the indigenous peoples of Cura ao had used to label themselves  Joubert and Van Buurt  1994   This theory is supported by early Spanish accounts  which refer to the indigenous peoples as  Indios Cura aos  which means  Healing Indians  as the aboriginals were likely already aware of the disease called scurvy and its cure from past experience as in North American natives  After 1525 the island appeared on Spanish maps as  Cura ote    Curasaote   and  Curasaore   By the 17th century the island was known on maps as  Cura ao  or  Curazao   On a map created by Hieronymus Cock in 1562 in Antwerp  the island was referred to as Quracao  9  The name  Cura ao  has become associated with a shade of blue  because of the deep blue version of the liqueur named Cura ao  also known as Blue Cura ao   Today  locally  the island is known as  Dushi Korsou   Sweet Cura ao    edit  History Main article  History of Cura ao Map of Cura ao in 1836 The original inhabitants of Cura ao were Arawak Amerindians  The first Europeans to see the island were members of a Spanish expedition under the leadership of Alonso de Ojeda in 1499  The Spaniards enslaved most of the indigenous population and forcibly relocated the survivors to other colonies where workers were needed  The island was occupied by the Dutch in 1634  The Dutch West India Company founded the capital of Willemstad on the banks of an inlet called the  Schottegat   Cura ao had been ignored by colonists because it lacked many things that colonists were interested in  such as gold deposits  However  the natural harbour of Willemstad proved quickly to be an ideal spot for trade  Commerce and shipping   and piracy became Cura ao s most important economic activities  In addition  the Dutch West India Company made Cura ao a centre for the Atlantic slave trade in 1662  In the French Dutch War following his successes at Cayenne and Tobago  the comte Jean d Estr es planned to attack Cura ao  His fleet 12 men of war  3 fireships  2 transports  a hospital ship and 12 privateers met with disaster  losing 7 of the men of war and 2 other ships when they struck reefs off the Las Aves archipelago due to a navigational error on 11 May 1678  a week after setting sail from Saint Kitts On Cura ao  a Day of Thanksgiving was observed until far into the 18th century to commemorate the island s fortunate escape from being ravaged by the French  Dutch merchants brought slaves from Africa under a contract with Spain called Asiento  Under this agreement  large numbers of slaves were sold and shipped to various destinations in South America and the Caribbean  Dutch architecture along Willemstad s harbour The slave trade made the island affluent  and led to the construction of impressive colonial buildings  Cura ao features architecture that blends Dutch and Spanish colonial styles  The wide range of historic buildings in and around Willemstad earned the capital a place on UNESCO s world heritage list  Landhouses  former plantation estates  and West African style  kas di pal i maishi   former slave dwellings  are scattered all over the island and some of them have been restored and can be visited  In 1795 a major slave revolt took place under the lead of the Negroes Tula Rigaud  Louis Mercier  Bastian Karpata and Pedro Wakao  Up to 4000 Negro slaves on the Northwest section of the island revolted  Over a thousand of the slaves were involved in heavy gunfights and the Dutch feared for their lives  After a month the rebellion was crushed  10  Cura ao s proximity to South America translated into a long standing influence from the nearby Latin American coast  This is reflected in the architectural similarities between the 19th century parts of Willemstad and the nearby Venezuelan city of Coro in Falc n State  the latter also being a UNESCO world heritage site  In the 19th century  Cura aoans such as Manuel Piar and Luis Bri n were prominently engaged in the wars of independence of Venezuela and Colombia  Political refugees from the mainland  like Bolivar himself  regrouped in Cura ao and children from affluent Venezuelan families were educated on the island  Luis Bri n  Cura ao born Venezuelan admiral During the 18th and 19th centuries  the island changed hands among the British  the French  and the Dutch several times  Stable Dutch rule returned in 1815  at the end of the Napoleonic wars  when the island was incorporated into the colony of Cura ao and Dependencies  The Dutch abolished slavery in 1863  The end of slavery caused economic hardship  prompting many inhabitants of Cura ao to emigrate to other islands  such as to Cuba to work in sugar cane plantations  Other former slaves had no place to go and remained working for the plantation owner in the so called Paga Tera system  This was an instituted order in which the Negro leases a piece of land and in exchange the Negro must give up most of his harvest to the former slave master  The Negroes were once again forced to work in mass production as in the former days otherwise they would not have enough for themselves after the lord s cut  This lasted till the beginning of the 20th century  When in 1914 oil was discovered in the Maracaibo Basin town of Mene Grande  the fortunes of the island were dramatically altered  Royal Dutch Shell and the Dutch Government had built an extensive oil refinery installation on the former site of the slave trade market at Asiento  thereby establishing an abundant source of employment for the local population and fuelling a wave of immigration from surrounding nations  Cura ao was an ideal site for the refinery as it was away from the social and civil unrest of the South American mainland  but near enough to the Maracaibo Basin oil fields  It had an excellent natural harbor that could accommodate large oil tankers  The company brought affluence to the island  Large scale housing was provided and Willemstad developed an extensive infrastructure  However  discrepancies appeared among the social groups of Cura ao  The discontent and the antagonisms between Cura ao social groups culminated in rioting and protest on May 30  1969  The civil unrest fuelled a social movement that resulted in the local Afro Caribbean population attaining more influence over the political process  Anderson and Dynes 1975   The island developed a tourist industry and offered low corporate taxes to encourage many companies to set up holdings in order to avoid rigorous schemes elsewhere  In the mid 1980s Royal Dutch Shell sold the refinery for a symbolic amount to a local government consortium  The ageing refinery has been the subject of lawsuits in recent years  which charge that its emissions  including sulfur dioxide and particulate matter  far exceed safety standards  11  The government consortium currently leases the refinery to the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA  In recent years  the island had attempted to capitalize on its peculiar history and heritage to expand its tourism industry  In 1984 the Island Council of Cura ao inaugurated the National Flag and the official anthem of the island  This was done on July 2  which was the date when in 1954 the first elected island council was instituted  Since then  the movement to separate the island from the Antillean federation has steadily become stronger  Due to an economic slump in recent years  emigration to the Netherlands has been high  Attempts by Dutch politicians to stem this flow of emigration have exacerbated already tense Dutch Cura ao relations  Immigration from surrounding Caribbean islands  Latin American countries and the Netherlands has taken place  View of Willemstad Panorama of Cura ao  Willemstad and Queen Juliana Bridge center  edit  Geography Like Aruba and Bonaire  Cura ao is a transcontinental island that is geographically part of South America but is also considered to be part of West Indies and one of the Leeward Antilles  Cura ao and the other ABC Islands are in terms of climate  geology  flora and fauna more akin to nearby Paraguan  Peninsula  Guajira Peninsula  Isla Margarita  Araya and the nearby Venezuelan areas of the Coro region and Falc n State  The flora of Cura ao differs from the typical tropical island vegetation  Xeric scrublands are common  with various forms of cacti  thorny shrubs  evergreens  and the island s national tree  divi divis  Cura ao s highest point is the Sint Christoffelberg 375 m  1 230 ft   Ten kilometers off the coast of Cura ao  to the south east  lies the small  uninhabited island of Klein Cura ao   Little Cura ao     edit  Beaches Cura ao is known for its coral reefs  used for scuba diving  The beaches on the south side contain many popular diving spots  An unusual feature of Cura ao diving is that the sea floor drops steeply within a few hundred feet of the shore  and the reef can easily be reached without a boat  This drop off is known as the  blue edge   Strong currents and lack of beaches make the rocky northern coast dangerous for swimming and diving  but experienced divers sometimes dive there from boats when conditions permit  The southern coast is very different and offers remarkably calm waters  The coastline of Cura ao features many bays and inlets  many of them suitable for mooring  Some of the coral reefs are affected by tourism  Porto Marie Beach is experimenting with artificial coral reefs in order to improve the reef s condition  Hundreds of artificial coral blocks that have been placed are now home to a large array of tropical fish  Seaquarium Beach The most well known beaches of Cura ao are  12  Baya Beach Blue Bay  Blauwbaai  Daaibooi Grote Knip  Playa Abou  Kleine Knip  Kenepa Chiki  Playa Forti Playa Gipy Playa Jeremi Playa Kalki Playa Kanoa Playa Lagun Playa Porto Marie Playa Santa Cruz Santa Barbara Beach Seaquarium Beach Westpunt  edit  Climate Cura ao has a semiarid climate with a dry season from January to September and a wet season from October to December  The temperatures are relatively constant with small differences throughout the year  The trade winds bring cooling during the day and the same trade winds bring warming during the night  The coldest month is January with an average temperature of 26 5  C  80  F  and the warmest month is September with an average temperature of 28 9  C  84  F   The year s average maximum temperature is 31 2  C  88  F   The year s average minimum temperature is 25 3  C  78  F   Cura ao lies outside the hurricane belt  but is still occasionally affected by hurricanes  as for example Omar in 2008  A landfall of a hurricane in Cura ao has not occurred since the National Hurricane Center started tracking hurricanes  Cura ao has  however  been directly affected by pre hurricane tropical storms several times  the latest which did so were Cesar in 1996  Joan Miriam in 1988  and Tomas in 2010  The latter brushed Cura ao as a tropical storm in early November  dropping up to 265 mm  10 4 in  of precipitation on the territory and triggering widespread flooding  13  This made Tomas one of the wettest events in the history of Cura ao  14  as well as one of the most devastating  cumulatively  damage across the island was preliminarily estimated at NA 60 million  US 28 million   15  and 2 fatalities were confirmed  16  Climate data for Cura ao

Politics of Cura ao The Queen Emma and Queen Juliana bridges  The Groot Davelaar  one of approximately 100 plantation houses on the island  Cura ao gained self government on 1 January 1954 as an island territory of the Netherlands Antilles  Despite this  the islanders did not fully participate in the political process until after the social movements of the late  60s  In the 2000s the political relationship with the other islands of the Netherlands Antilles  and with the Netherlands  came under discussion again  In a referendum held on 8 April 2005  the residents voted for separate status outside the Netherlands Antilles  similar to Aruba  rejecting the options for full independence  becoming part of the Netherlands  or retaining the status quo  In 2006  Emily de Jongh Elhage  a resident of Cura ao  was elected as the new prime minister of the Netherlands Antilles  On 1 July 2007  the island of Cura ao was due to become a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands  On 28 November 2006  the island council rejected a clarification memorandum on the process  On 9 July 2007 the new island council of Cura ao ratified the agreement previously rejected in November 2006  18  On 15 December 2008  Cura ao was scheduled to become a separate country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands  like Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles that time   A non binding referendum on this plan took place in Cura ao on 15 May 2009  in which 52 percent of the voters supported these plans  19  Dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles was effected on 10 October 2010  20  Cura ao became a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands  with the Kingdom retaining responsibility for defence and foreign policy  The Kingdom was also to oversee the island s finances under a debt relief arrangement agreed between the two  21   edit  Education Historically  education on Cura ao  Aruba and Bonaire had been predominantly in Spanish up until the late 19th century  There were also efforts to introduce bilingual popular education in Dutch and Papiamentu in the late 19th century  van Putte 1999   Dutch was made the sole language of instruction in the educational system in the early 20th century to facilitate education for the offspring of expatriate employees of Royal Dutch Shell  Romer  1999   Papiamentu was tentatively re introduced in the school curriculum during the mid 1980s  Recent political debate has centered on the issue of Papiamentu becoming the sole language of instruction  Proponents of making Papiamentu the sole language of instruction argue that it will help to preserve the language and will improve the quality of primary and secondary school education  Proponents of Dutch language instruction argue that students who study in Dutch will be better prepared for the university education offered to Cura ao residents in the Netherlands  Public education is based on the Dutch educational system and besides the public schools  private and parochial schools are also available  Since the introduction of a new public education law in 1992  compulsory primary education starts at age six and continues six years  secondary lasts for another five  22  The main institute of higher learning is the University of Cura ao  enrolling 2100 students  22   edit  Economy Main article  Economy of Cura ao Although a few plantations were established on the island by the Dutch  the first profitable industry established on Cura ao was salt mining  The mineral was a lucrative export at the time and became one of the major factors responsible for drawing the island into international commerce  Cura ao also became a centre for slave trade during the 17th and 18th centuries  In the 19th century  phosphate mining also became significant  All the while  Cura ao s fine deep water ports and ideal location in the Caribbean were crucial in making it a significant centre of commerce  Cura ao has one of the highest standards of living in the Caribbean  with a GDP per capita of US  20 500  2009 est   and a well developed infrastructure  The main industries of the island include oil refining  tourism and financial services  Shipping  international trade and other activities related to the port of Willemstad  like the Free Zone  make a contribution to the economy  To achieve the government s aims to make its economy more diverse  significant efforts are being made to attract more foreign investments  This policy is called the  Open Arms  policy with one of its main features to focus heavily on information technology companies  23  24  25  For its size  the island has a considerably diverse economy which does not rely mostly on tourism alone as is the case on many other Caribbean islands  Beginning in January 2014  the Lynx rocketplane is expected to be flying suborbital space tourism flights and scientific research missions from a new spaceport on Cura ao  26  27  Cura ao has business ties with the United States  Venezuela and the European Union  It has an Association Agreement with the European Union which allows companies which do business in and via Cura ao to export many products to European markets  28  free of import duties and quotas  It is also a participant in the US Caribbean Basin Initiative allowing it to have preferential access to the US market  29  Prostitution is tolerated  A large open air brothel called  Le Mirage  or  Campo Alegre  operates near the airport since the 1940s  As prostitution exists in most parts of the world  Cura ao has implemented a different approach on handling prostitution  By monitoring  containing and regulating it  the workers in these establishments are given a safe environment and access to medical practitioners  Despite this  it should be noted that the U S  State Department stated  Cura ao  Aruba  and Saint Maarten are destination islands for women trafficked for the sex trade from Peru  Brazil  Colombia  the Dominican Republic  and Haiti  according to local observers   30  Officials in the government frequently underestimate the extent of human trafficking problems  30   edit  Demographics  edit  Ethnicities A Bulawaya dance Because of its history  the island s population comes from many ethnic backgrounds  There is an Afro Caribbean majority of African descent  and also sizeable minorities of Dutch  Latin American  French  South Asian  East Asian  Portuguese and Levantine people  The Sephardic Jews who arrived from the Netherlands and then Dutch Brazil since the 17th century have had a significant influence on the culture and economy of the island  The years before and after World War II also saw an influx of Ashkenazi Jews from Eastern Europe  many of whom were Romanian Jews  In the early 19th century  many Portuguese and Lebanese migrated to Cura ao attracted by the financial possibilities of the island  East and South Asian migrants arrived during the economic boom of the early 20th century  There are also many recent immigrants from neighbouring countries  most notably the Dominican Republic  Haiti  the Anglophone Caribbean and Colombia  In recent years the influx of Dutch pensioners has increased significantly  dubbed locally as pensionados   edit  Religion According to the 2001 census  the majority of the inhabitants of Cura ao are Roman Catholic  85    This includes a shift towards the Charismatic Renewal or Charismatic movement since the mid seventies  Other major denominations are the Seventh day Adventist Church and the Methodist Church  Alongside these Christian denominations  some inhabitants practice Montamentu  and other diaspora African religions  Like elsewhere in Latin America  Pentecostalism is on the rise  There are also practising Muslims as well as Hindus  Though small in size  Cura ao s Jewish community has a significant impact on history  Cura ao is home to the oldest active Jewish congregation in the Americas  dating to 1651  The Cura ao synagogue is the oldest synagogue of the Americas in continuous use  since its completion in 1732 on the site of a previous synagogue  The Jewish Community of Cura ao also played a key role in supporting early Jewish congregations in the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries  including in New York City and the Touro Synagogue   edit  Culture Cura ao is a polyglot society  The languages widely spoken are Papiamentu  Dutch  English  and Spanish  Most people on the island  85 percent  speak Papiamentu  Many people can speak all four of these languages  Spanish and English both have a long historical presence on the island alongside Dutch and Papiamentu  Spanish remained an important language throughout the 18th and 19th centuries as well due to the close economic ties with nearby Venezuela and Colombia  The use of English dates back to the early 19th century  when Cura ao became a British colony  In fact  after the restoration of Dutch rule in 1815  colonial officers already noted wide use of English among the island  van Putte 1999   Recent immigration from the Anglophone Caribbean and the SSS islands of  St  Eustatius  Saba and Sint Maarten  where the primary language is English as well as the ascendancy of English as a world language  has intensified the use of English on Cura ao  For much of colonial history  Dutch was never as widely spoken as English or Spanish and remained exclusively a language for administration and legal matters  popular use of Dutch increased towards the end of the 19th century and the early 20th century  van Putte 1999   Cura ao is one of just a handful of social language planning instances where creole language became a medium to acquire basic literacy with introduction of Papiamentu as a language of primary school education in 1993  31   edit  Literature Despite the island s relatively small population  the diversity of languages and cultural influences on Cura ao have generated a remarkable literary tradition  primarily in Dutch and Papiamentu  The oral traditions of the Arawak indigenous peoples are lost  West African slaves brought the tales of Anansi  thus forming the basis of Papiamentu literature  The first published work in Papiamentu was a poem by Joseph Sickman Corsen entitled Atardi  published in the La Cruz newspaper in 1905  Throughout Cura aoan literature  narrative techniques and metaphors best characterized as magic realism tend to predominate  Novelists and poets from Cura ao have made an impressive contribution to Caribbean and Dutch literature  Best known are Cola Debrot  Frank Martinus Arion  Pierre Lauffer  Elis Juliana Guillermo Rosario  Boeli van Leeuwen and Tip Marugg   edit  Cuisine Local food is called Kriyoyo  pronounced the same as criollo  the Spanish word for  Creole   and boasts a blend of flavours and techniques best compared to Caribbean cuisine and Latin American cuisine  Dishes common in Cura ao are found in Aruba and Bonaire as well  Popular dishes include  stob   a stew made with various ingredients such as papaya  beef or goat   Guiambo  soup made from okra and seafood   kadushi  cactus soup   sopi mondongo  intestine soup   funchi  cornmeal paste similar to fufu  ugali and polenta  and a lot of fish and other seafood  The ubiquitous side dish is fried plantain  Local bread rolls are made according to a Portuguese recipe  All around the island  there are sn k s which serve local dishes as well as alcoholic drinks in a manner akin to the English public house  The ubiquitous breakfast dish is pastechi  fried pastry with fillings of cheese  tuna  ham  or ground meat  Around the holiday season special dishes are consumed  such as the hallaca and pekel   made out of salt cod  At weddings and other special occasions a variety of kos dushi are served  kokada  coconut sweets   ko i lechi  condensed milk and sugar sweet  and tentalaria  peanut sweets   The Cura ao liqueur was developed here  when a local experimented with the rinds of the local citrus fruit known as laraha  Surinamese  Chinese  Indonesian  Indian and Dutch culinary influences also abound  The island also has many Chinese restaurants that serve mainly Indonesian dishes such as satay  nasi goreng and lumpia  which are all Indonesian names for the dishes   Dutch specialties such as croquettes and oliebollen are widely served in homes and restaurants   edit  Sports Since 2001  the Pabao Little League baseball team from Willemstad  Cura ao has made it all the way to the Little League World Series in Williamsport  Pennsylvania  The team features players from ages 11 and 12 who get a chance to represent the Caribbean region  In 2004 the team from Willemstad  Cura ao won the title game against the United States champion from Thousand Oaks  California  The following year the team from Cura ao made it right back to the championship game but were defeated by Ewa Beach  Hawaii after Michael Memea hit a walk off home run to win the title game for Hawaii  In 2007 the team lost to Japan in the International Championship game  In the 2006 World Baseball Classic  Cura aoans played for the Netherlands team  Shairon Martis  born in Willemstad  provided the highlight of the tournament for the Dutch team by throwing a seven inning no hitter against Panama  the game was stopped due to the mercy rule   In addition  Major League player and All Star Andruw Jones and Tirone Maria  currently playing in Aruba  are Cura aoans  The 2010 documentary film  Boys of Summer  details Cura ao s Pabao Little League All Stars winning their country s eighth straight championship at the 2008 Little League World Series  then going on to defeat many formidable teams  including Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic  and earning a spot in Williamsport  The prevailing trade winds and warm water make Cura ao a very good location for windsurfing  although the nearby islands of Aruba and Bonaire are far better known in the sport  32  33  One factor is that the deep water around Cura ao makes it difficult to lay marks for major windsurfing events  thus hindering the island s success as a windsurfing destination  Similarly  the warm clear water around the island makes Cura ao a Mecca for diving  34   edit  Notable residents Famous people from Cura ao include   edit  In arts and culture Kizzy McHugh  a singer songwriter and television personality based in the United States Peter
