Plate tectonics From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search The tectonic plates of the world were mapped in the second half of the 20th century  Plate motion based on Global Positioning System  GPS  satellite data from NASA JPL  The vectors show direction and magnitude of motion  Remnants of the Farallon Plate  deep in Earth s mantle  It is thought that much of the plate initially went under North America  particularly the western United States and southwest Canada  at a very shallow angle  creating much of the mountainous terrain in the area  particularly the southern Rocky Mountains   Plate tectonics  from the Late Latin tectonicus  from the Greek              pertaining to building   1  is a scientific theory that describes the large scale motions of Earth s lithosphere  The theory builds on the concepts of continental drift  developed during the first decades of the 20th century  It was accepted by the geoscientific community after the concepts of seafloor spreading were developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s  The lithosphere is broken up into tectonic plates  On Earth  there are seven or eight major plates  depending on how they are defined  and many minor plates  Where plates meet  their relative motion determines the type of boundary  convergent  divergent  or transform  Earthquakes  volcanic activity  mountain building  and oceanic trench formation occur along these plate boundaries  The lateral relative movement of the plates typically varies from zero to 100 mm annually  2  Tectonic plates are composed of oceanic lithosphere and thicker continental lithosphere  each topped by its own kind of crust  Along convergent boundaries  subduction carries plates into the mantle  the material lost is roughly balanced by the formation of new  oceanic  crust along divergent margins by seafloor spreading  In this way  the total surface of the globe remains the same  This prediction of plate tectonics is also referred to as the conveyor belt principle  Earlier theories  that still have some supporters  proposed gradual shrinking  contraction  or gradual expansion of the globe  3  Tectonic plates are able to move because the Earth s lithosphere has a higher strength and lower density than the underlying asthenosphere  Lateral density variations in the mantle result in convection  Their movement is thought to be driven by a combination of the motion of seafloor away from the spreading ridge  due to variations in topography and density of the crust that result in differences in gravitational forces  and drag  downward suction  at the subduction zones  A different explanation lies in different forces generated by the rotation of the globe and tidal forces of the Sun and the Moon  The relative importance of each of these factors is unclear  and is still subject to debate  see also below   Contents 1 Key principles 2 Types of plate boundaries 3 Driving forces of plate motion 3 1 Driving

External links 11 1 Videos Key principles The outer layers of the Earth are divided into lithosphere and asthenosphere  This is based on differences in mechanical properties and in the method for the transfer of heat  Mechanically  the lithosphere is cooler and more rigid  while the asthenosphere is hotter and flows more easily  In terms of heat transfer  the lithosphere loses heat by conduction whereas the asthenosphere also transfers heat by convection and has a nearly adiabatic temperature gradient  This division should not be confused with the chemical subdivision of these same layers into the mantle  comprising both the asthenosphere and the mantle portion of the lithosphere  and the crust  a given piece of mantle may be part of the lithosphere or the asthenosphere at different times  depending on its temperature and pressure  The key principle of plate tectonics is that the lithosphere exists as separate and distinct tectonic plates  which ride on the fluid like  visco elastic solid  asthenosphere  Plate motions range up to a typical 10 40 mm a  Mid Atlantic Ridge  about as fast as fingernails grow   to about 160 mm a  Nazca Plate  about as fast as hair grows   4  The driving mechanism behind this movement is described separately below  Tectonic lithosphere plates consist of lithospheric mantle overlain by either or both of two types of crustal material  oceanic crust  in older texts called sima from silicon and magnesium  and continental crust  sial from silicon and aluminum   Average oceanic lithosphere is typically 100 km thick  5  its thickness is a function of its age  as time passes  it conductively cools and becomes thicker  Because it is formed at mid ocean ridges and spreads outwards  its thickness is therefore a function of its distance from the mid ocean ridge where it was formed  For a typical distance oceanic lithosphere must travel before being subducted  the thickness varies from about 6 km thick at mid ocean ridges to greater than 100 km at subduction zones  for shorter or longer distances  the subduction zone  and therefore also the mean  thickness becomes smaller or larger  respectively  6  Continental lithosphere is typically  200 km thick  though this also varies considerably between basins  mountain ranges  and stable cratonic interiors of continents  The two types of crust also differ in thickness  with continental crust being considerably thicker than oceanic  35 km vs  6 km   7  The location where two plates meet is called a plate boundary  and plate boundaries are commonly associated with geological events such as earthquakes and the creation of topographic features such as mountains  volcanoes  mid ocean ridges  and oceanic trenches  The majority of the world s active volcanoes occur along plate boundaries  with the Pacific Plate s Ring of Fire being most active and most widely known  These boundaries are discussed in further detail below  Some volcanoes occur in the interiors of plates  and these have been variously attributed to internal plate deformation 8  and to mantle plumes  As explained above  tectonic plates can include continental crust or oceanic crust  and many plates contain both  For example  the African Plate includes the continent and parts of the floor of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans  The distinction between oceanic crust and continental crust is based on their modes of formation  Oceanic crust is formed at sea floor spreading centers  and continental crust is formed through arc volcanism and accretion of terranes through tectonic processes  though some of these terranes may contain ophiolite sequences  which are pieces of oceanic crust  these are considered part of the continent when they exit the standard cycle of formation and spreading centers and subduction beneath continents  Oceanic crust is also denser than continental crust owing to their different compositions  Oceanic crust is denser because it has less silicon and more heavier elements   mafic   than continental crust   felsic    9  As a result of this density stratification  oceanic crust generally lies below sea level  for example most of the Pacific Plate   while the continental crust buoyantly projects above sea level  see the page isostasy for explanation of this principle   Types of plate boundaries Three types of plate boundary  Main article  List of tectonic plate interactions Basically  three types of plate boundaries exist  10  with a fourth  mixed type  characterized by the way the plates move relative to each other  They are associated with different types of surface phenomena  The different types of plate boundaries are  11  12  Transform boundaries  Conservative  occur where plates slide or  perhaps more accurately  grind past each other along transform faults  The relative motion of the two plates is either sinistral  left side toward the observer  or dextral  right side toward the observer   The San Andreas Fault in California is an example of a transform boundary exhibiting dextral motion  Divergent boundaries  Constructive  occur where two plates slide apart from each other  Mid ocean ridges  e g   Mid Atlantic Ridge  and active zones of rifting  such as Africa s East African Rift  are both examples of divergent boundaries  Convergent boundaries  Destructive   or active margins  occur where two plates slide towards each other commonly forming either a subduction zone  if one plate moves underneath the other  or a continental collision  if the two plates contain continental crust   Deep marine trenches are typically associated with subduction zones  and the basins that develop along the active boundary are often called  foreland basins   The subducting slab contains many hydrous minerals  which release their water on heating  this water then causes the mantle to melt  producing volcanism  Examples of this are the Andes mountain range in South America and the Japanese island arc  Plate boundary zones occur where the effects of the interactions are unclear and the boundaries  usually occurring along a broad belt  are not well defined  and may show various types of movements in different episodes  Driving forces of plate motion Plate tectonics is basically a kinematic phenomenon  Earth scientists agree upon the observation and deduction that the plates have moved one with respect to the other  and debate and find agreements on how and when  But still a major question remains on what the motor behind this movement is  the geodynamic mechanism  and here science diverges in different theories  Generally  it is accepted that tectonic plates are able to move because of the relative density of oceanic lithosphere and the relative weakness of the asthenosphere  Dissipation of heat from the mantle is acknowledged to be the original source of energy driving plate tectonics  through convection or large scale upwelling and doming  As a consequence  in the current view  although it is still a matter of some debate  because of the excess density of the oceanic lithosphere sinking in subduction zones a powerful source of plate motion is generated  When the new crust forms at mid ocean ridges  this oceanic lithosphere is initially less dense than the underlying asthenosphere  but it becomes denser with age  as it conductively cools and thickens  The greater density of old lithosphere relative to the underlying asthenosphere allows it to sink into the deep mantle at subduction zones  providing most of the driving force for plate motions  The weakness of the asthenosphere allows the tectonic plates to move easily towards a subduction zone  13  Although subduction is believed to be the strongest force driving plate motions  it cannot be the only force since there are plates such as the North American Plate which are moving  yet are nowhere being subducted  The same is true for the enormous Eurasian Plate  The sources of plate motion are a matter of intensive research and discussion among earth scientists  One of the main points is that the kinematic pattern of the movements itself should be separated clearly from the possible geodynamic mechanism that is invoked as the driving force of the observed movements  as some patterns may be explained by more than one mechanism  14  Basically  the driving forces that are advocated at the moment  can be divided in three categories  mantle dynamics related  gravity related  mostly secondary forces   and Earth rotation related  Driving forces related to mantle dynamics Main article  Mantle convection For a considerable period of around 25 years  last quarter of the twentieth century  the leading theory envisaged large scale convection currents in the upper mantle which are transmitted through the asthenosphere as the main driving force of the tectonic plates  This theory was launched by Arthur Holmes and some forerunners in the 1930s and was immediately recognized as the solution for the acceptance of the theory discussed since its occurrence in the papers of Alfred Wegener in the early years of the century  It was  though  long debated because the leading   fixist   theory was still envisaging a static Earth without moving continents  up until the major break throughs in the early sixties  Two  and three dimensional imaging of the Earth s interior  seismic tomography  shows that there is a laterally varying density distribution throughout the mantle  Such density variations can be material  from rock chemistry   mineral  from variations in mineral structures   or thermal  through thermal expansion and contraction from heat energy   The manifestation of this varying lateral density is mantle convection from buoyancy forces  15  How mantle convection relates directly and indirectly to the motion of the plates is a matter of ongoing study and discussion in geodynamics  Somehow  this energy must be transferred to the lithosphere for tectonic plates to move  There are essentially two types of forces that are thought to influence plate motion  friction and gravity  Basal drag  friction   The plate motion is in this way driven by friction between the convection currents in the asthenosphere and the more rigid overlying floating lithosphere  Slab suction  gravity   Local convection currents exert a downward frictional pull on plates in subduction zones at ocean trenches  Slab suction may occur in a geodynamic setting wherein basal tractions continue to act on the plate as it dives into the mantle  although perhaps to a greater extent acting on both the under and upper side of the slab   Lately  the convection theory is much debated as modern techniques based on 3D seismic tomography of imaging the internal structure of the Earth s mantle still fail to recognize these predicted large scale convection cells  Therefore  alternative views have been proposed  In the theory of plume tectonics developed during the 1990s  a modified concept of mantle convection currents is used  related to super plumes rising from the deeper mantle which would be the drivers or the substitutes of the major convection cells  These ideas  which find their roots in the early 1930s with the so called  fixistic  ideas of the European and Russian Earth Science Schools  find resonance in the modern theories which envisage hot spots mantle plumes in the mantle which remain fixed and are overridden by oceanic and continental lithosphere plates during time  and leave their traces in the geological record  though these phenomena are not invoked as real driving mechanisms  but rather as a modulator   The modern theories that continue building on the older mantle doming concepts and see the movements of the plates a secondary phenomena  are beyond the scope of this page and are discussed elsewhere for example on the plume tectonics page  Another suggestion is that the mantle flows neither in cells nor large plumes  but rather as a series of channels just below the Earth s crust which then provide basal friction to the lithosphere  This theory is called  surge tectonics  and became quite popular in geophysics and geodynamics during the 1980s and 1990s  16  Driving forces related to gravity Gravity related forces are usually invoked as secondary phenomena within the framework of a more general driving mechanism such as the various forms of mantle dynamics described above  Gravitational sliding away from a spreading ridge  According to many authors  plate motion is driven by the higher elevation of plates at ocean ridges  17  As oceanic lithosphere is formed at spreading ridges from hot mantle material  it gradually cools and thickens with age  and thus distance from the ridge   Cool oceanic lithosphere is significantly denser than the hot mantle material from which it is derived and so with increasing thickness it gradually subsides into the mantle to compensate the greater load  The result is a slight lateral incline with distance from the ridge axis  This force is regarded as a secondary force often referred to as  ridge push   This is a misnomer as nothing is  pushing  horizontally and tensional features are dominant along ridges  It is more accurate to refer to this mechanism as gravitational sliding as variable topography across the totality of the plate can vary considerably and the topography of spreading ridges is only the most prominent feature  Other mechanisms generating this gravitational secondary force include flexural bulging of the lithosphere before it dives underneath an adjacent plate  which produces a clear topographical feature that can offset or at least affect the influence of topographical ocean ridges  and mantle plumes and hot spots  which are postulated to impinge on the underside of tectonic plates  Slab pull  Current scientific opinion is that the asthenosphere is insufficiently competent or rigid to directly cause motion by friction along the base of the lithosphere  Slab pull is therefore most widely thought to be the greatest force acting on the plates  In this current understanding  plate motion is mostly driven by the weight of cold  dense plates sinking into the mantle at trenches  18  Recent models indicate that trench suction plays an important role as well  However  as the North American Plate is nowhere being subducted  yet it is in motion presents a problem  The same holds for the African  Eurasian  and Antarctic plates  Gravitational sliding away from mantle doming  According to older theories one of the driving mechanisms of the plates is the existence of large scale asthenosphere mantle domes  which cause the gravitational sliding of lithosphere plates away from them  This gravitational sliding represents a secondary phenomenon of this  basically vertically oriented mechanism  This can act on various scales  from the small scale of one island arc up to the larger scale of an entire ocean basin  19  Driving forces related to Earth rotation Alfred Wegener  being a meteorologist  had proposed tidal forces and pole flight force as main driving mechanisms for continental drift  However  these forces were considered far too small to cause continental motion as the concept then was of continents plowing through oceanic crust  20  Therefore  Wegener converted to convection currents as the main driving force in the last edition of his book in 1929  In the plate tectonics context  accepted since the seafloor spreading proposals of Heezen  Hess  Dietz  Morley  Vine and Matthews  see below  during the early 1960s  though  oceanic crust is in motion with the continents which caused the proposals related to Earth rotation to be reconsidered  In more recent literature  these driving forces are  Tidal drag due to the gravitational force the Moon  and the Sun  exerts on the crust of the Earth Shear strain of the Earth globe due to N S compression related to the rotation and modulations of it  Pole flight force  equatorial drift due to rotation and centrifugal effects  tendency of the plates to move from the poles to the equator   Polflucht    Coriolis effect acting on plates when they move around the globe  Global deformation of the geoid due to small displacements of rotational pole with respect to the Earth crust  Other smaller deformation effects of the crust due to wobbles and spin movements of the Earth rotation on a smaller time scale  For these mechanisms to be overall valid  systematic relationships should exist all over the globe between the orientation and kinematics of deformation  and the geographical latitudinal and longitudinal grid of the Earth itself  Ironically  these systematic relations studies in the second half of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century do underline exactly the opposite  that the plates had not moved in time  that the deformation grid was fixed with respect to the Earth equator and axis  and that gravitational driving forces were generally acting vertically and caused only locally horizontal movements  the so called pre plate tectonic   fixist theories    Later studies  discussed below on this page  therefore invoked many of the relationships recognized during this pre plate tectonics period  to support their theories  see the anticipations and reviews in the work of van Dijk and collaborators  21  Of the many forces discussed in this paragraph  tidal force is still highly debated and defended as a possible principle driving force  whereas the other forces are used or in global geodynamic models not using the plate tectonics concepts  therefore beyond the discussions treated in this section   or proposed as minor modulations within the overall plate tectonics model  In 1973 George W  Moore 22  of the USGS and R  C  Bostrom 23  presented evidence for a general westward drift of the Earth s lithosphere with respect to the mantle  and  therefore  tidal forces or tidal lag or  friction  due to the Earth s rotation and the forces acting upon it by the Moon being a driving force for plate tectonics  as the Earth spins eastward beneath the moon  the moon s gravity ever so slightly pulls the Earth s surface layer back westward  just like proposed by Alfred Wegener  see above   In a more recent 2006 study  24  scientists reviewed and advocated these earlier proposed ideas  It has also been suggested recently in Lovett  2006  that this observation may also explain why Venus and Mars have no plate tectonics  since Venus has no moon and Mars  moons are too small to have significant tidal effects on Mars  In a recent paper 25  it was suggested that  on the other hand  it can easily be observed that many plates are moving north and eastward  and that the dominantly westward motion of the Pacific ocean basins derives simply from the eastward bias of the Pacific spreading center  which is not a predicted manifestation of such lunar forces   In the same paper the authors admit  however  that relative to the lower mantle  there is a slight westward component in the motions of all the plates  They demonstrated though that the westward drift  seen only for the past 30 Ma  is attributed to the increased dominance of the steadily growing and accelerating Pacific plate  The debate is still open  Relative significance of each driving force mechanism The actual vector of a plate s motion must necessarily be a function of all the forces acting upon the plate  However  therein remains the problem regarding what degree each process contributes to the motion of each tectonic plate  The diversity of geodynamic settings and properties of each plate must clearly result in differences in the degree to which such processes are actively driving the plates  One method of dealing with this problem is to consider the relative rate at which each plate is moving and to consider the available evidence of each driving force upon the plate as far as possible  One of the most significant correlations found is that lithospheric plates attached to downgoing  subducting  plates move much faster than plates not attached to subducting plates  The Pacific plate  for instance  is essentially surrounded by zones of subduction  the so called Ring of Fire  and moves much faster than the plates of the Atlantic basin  which are attached  perhaps one could say  welded   to adjacent continents instead of subducting plates  It is thus thought that forces associated with the downgoing plate  slab pull and slab suction  are the driving forces which determine the motion of plates  except for those plates which are not being subducted  18  The driving forces of plate motion continue to be active subjects of on going research within geophysics and tectonophysics  Development of the theory Main article  Timeline of the development of tectonophysics Plate tectonics is the main current theory in Earth Sciences regarding the development of our planet Earth  It is  therefore  appropriate to dedicate some space to explain how the Earth Science community  step by step  has built this theory  from early speculations  through the gathering of proof and severe debates  up to the refinement and quantification  and still ongoing confrontations with alternative ideas  Summary Detailed map showing the tectonic plates with their movement vectors  In line with other previous and contemporaneous proposals  in 1912 the meteorologist Alfred Wegener amply described what he called continental drift  expanded in his 1915 book The Origin of Continents and Oceans 26  and the scientific debate started that would end up fifty years later in the theory of plate tectonics  27  Starting from the idea  also expressed by his forerunners  that the present continents once formed a single land mass  which was called Pangea later on  that drifted apart  thus releasing the continents from the Earth s mantle and likening them to  icebergs  of low density granite floating on a sea of denser basalt  28  Supporting evidence for the idea came from the dove tailing outlines of South America s east coast and Africa s west coast  and from the matching of the rock formations along these edges  Confirmation of their previous contiguous nature also came from the fossil plants Glossopteris and Gangamopteris  and the therapsid or mammal like reptile Lystrosaurus  all widely distributed over South America  Africa  Antarctica  India and Australia  The evidence for such an erstwhile joining of these continents was patent to field geologists working in the southern hemisphere  The South African Alex du Toit put together a mass of such information in his 1937 publication Our Wandering Continents  and went further than Wegener in recognising the strong links between the Gondwana fragments  But without detailed evidence and a force sufficient to drive the movement  the theory was not generally accepted  the Earth might have a solid crust and mantle and a liquid core  but there seemed to be no way that portions of the crust could move around  Distinguished scientists  such as Harold Jeffreys and Charles Schuchert  were outspoken critics of continental drift  Despite much opposition  the view of continental drift gained support and a lively debate started between  drifters  or  mobilists   proponents of the theory  and  fixists   opponents   During the 1920s  1930s and 1940s  the former reached important milestones proposing that convection currents might have driven the plate movements  and that spreading may have occurred below the sea within the oceanic crust  Concepts close to the elements now incorporated in plate tectonics were proposed by geophysisists and geologists  both fixists and mobilists  like Vening Meinesz  Holmes  and Umbgrove  One of the first pieces of geophysical evidence that was used to support the movement of lithospheric plates came from paleomagnetism  This is based on the fact that rocks of different ages show a variable magnetic field direction  evidenced by studies since the mid nineteenth century  The magnetic north and south poles reverse through time  and  especially important in paleotectonic studies  the relative position of the magnetic north pole varies through time  Initially  during the first half of the twentieth century  the latter phenomenon was explained by introducing what was called  polar wander   see apparent polar wander   i e   it was assumed that the north pole location had been shifting through time  An alternative explanation  though  was that the continents had moved  shifted and rotated  relative to the north pole  and each continent  in fact  shows its own  polar wander path   During the late 1950s it was successfully shown on two occasions that these data could show the validity of continental drift  by Keith Runcorn in a paper in 1956  29  and by Warren Carey in a symposium held in March 1956  30  The second piece of evidence in support of continental drift came during the late 1950s and early 60s from data on the bathymetry of the deep ocean floors and the nature of the oceanic crust such as magnetic properties and  more generally  with the development of marine geology 31  which gave evidence for the association of seafloor spreading along the mid oceanic ridges and magnetic field reversals  published between 1959 and 1963 by Heezen  Dietz  Hess  Mason  Vine  amp  Matthews  and Morley  32  Simultaneous advances in early seismic imaging techniques in and around Wadati Benioff zones along the trenches bounding many continental margins  together with many other geophysical  e g  gravimetric  and geological observations  showed how the oceanic crust could disappear into the mantle  providing the mechanism to balance the extension of the ocean basins with shortening along its margins  All this evidence  both from the ocean floor and from the continental margins  made it clear around 1965 that continental drift was feasible and the theory of plate tectonics  which was defined in a series of papers between 1965 and 1967  was born  with all its extraordinary explanatory and predictive power  The theory revolutionized the Earth sciences  explaining a diverse range of geological phenomena and their implications in other studies such as paleogeography and paleobiology  Continental drift For more details on this topic  see Continental drift  In the late 19th and early 20th centuries  geologists assumed that the Earth s major features were fixed  and that most geologic features such as basin development and mountain ranges could be explained by vertical crustal movement  described in what is called the geosynclinal theory  Generally  this was placed in the context of a contracting planet Earth due to heat loss in the course of a relatively short geological time  It was observed as early as 1596 that the opposite coasts of the Atlantic Ocean or  more precisely  the edges of the continental shelves have similar shapes and seem to have once fitted together  33  Since that time many theories were proposed to explain this apparent complementarity  but the assumption of a solid Earth made these various proposals difficult to accept  34  The discovery of radioactivity and its associated heating properties in 1895 prompted a re examination of the apparent age of the Earth  35  since this had previously been estimated by its cooling rate and assumption the Earth s surface radiated like a black body  36  Those calculations had implied that  even if it started at red heat  the Earth would have dropped to its present temperature in a few tens of millions of years  Armed with the knowledge of a new heat source  scientists realized that the Earth would be much older  and that its core was still sufficiently hot to be liquid  By 1915  after having published a first article in 1912  37  Alfred Wegener was making serious arguments for the idea of continental drift in the first edition of The Origin of Continents and Oceans  26  In that book  re issued in four successive editions up to the final one in 1936   he noted how the east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa looked as if they were once attached  Wegener was not the first to note this  Abraham Ortelius  Snider Pellegrini  Roberto Mantovani and Frank Bursley Taylor preceded him just to mention a few   but he was the first to marshal significant fossil and paleo topographical and climatological evidence to support this simple observation  and was supported in this by researchers such as Alex du Toit   Furthermore  when the rock strata of the margins of separate continents are very similar it suggests that these rocks were formed in the same way  implying that they were joined initially  For instance  parts of Scotland and Ireland contain rocks very similar to those found in Newfoundland and New Brunswick  Furthermore  the Caledonian Mountains of Europe and parts of the Appalachian Mountains of North America are very similar in structure and lithology  However  his ideas were not taken seriously by many geologists  who pointed out that there was no apparent mechanism for continental drift  Specifically  they did not see how continental rock could plow through the much denser rock that makes up oceanic crust  Wegener could not explain the force that drove continental drift  and his vindication did not come until after his death in 1930  Floating continents  paleomagnetism  and seismicity zones As it was observed early that although granite existed on continents  seafloor seemed to be composed of denser basalt  the prevailing concept during the first half of the twentieth century was that there were two types of crust  named  sial   continental type crust   and  sima   oceanic type crust   Furthermore  it was supposed that a static shells of strata was present under the continents  It therefore looked apparent that a layer of basalt  sial  underlies the continental rocks  However  based upon abnormalities in plumb line deflection by the Andes in Peru  Pierre Bouguer had deduced that less dense mountains must have a downward projection into the denser layer underneath  The concept that mountains had  roots  was confirmed by George B  Airy a hundred years later during study of Himalayan gravitation  and seismic studies detected corresponding density variations  Therefore  by the mid 1950s the question remained unresolved of whether mountain roots were clenched in surrounding basalt or were floating upon it like an iceberg  During the 20th century  improvements in and greater use of seismic instruments such as seismographs enabled scientists to learn that earthquakes tend to be concentrated in specific areas  most notably along the oceanic trenches and spreading ridges  By the late 1920s  seismologists were beginning to identify several prominent earthquake zones parallel to the trenches that typically were inclined 40 60  from the horizontal and extended several hundred kilometers into the Earth  These zones later became known as Wadati Benioff zones  or simply Benioff zones  in honor of the seismologists who first recognized them  Kiyoo Wadati of Japan and Hugo Benioff of the United States  The study of global seismicity greatly advanced in the 1960s with the establishment of the Worldwide Standardized Seismograph Network  WWSSN  38  to monitor the compliance of the 1963 treaty banning above ground testing of nuclear weapons  The much improved data from the WWSSN instruments allowed seismologists to map precisely the zones of earthquake concentration world wide  Meanwhile  debates developed around the phenomena of polar wander  Since the early debates of continental drift  scientists had discussed and used evidence that polar drift had occurred because continents seemed to have moved through different climatic zones during the past  Furthermore  paleomagnetic data had shown that the magnetic pole had also shifted during time  Reasoning in an opposite way  the continents might have shifted and rotated  while the pole remained relatively fixed  The first time the evidence of magnetic polar wander was used to support the movements of continents was in a paper by Keith Runcorn in 1956  29  and successive papers by him and his students Ted Irving  who was actually the first to be convinced of the fact that paleomagnetism supported continental drift  and Ken Creer  This was immediately followed by a symposium in Tasmania in March 1956  39  In this symposium  the evidence was used in the theory of an expansion of the global crust  In this hypothesis the shifting of the continents can be simply explained by a large increase in size of the Earth since its formation  However  this was unsatisfactory because its supporters could offer no convincing mechanism to produce a significant expansion of the Earth  Certainly there is no evidence that the moon has expanded in the past 3 billion years  other work would soon show that the evidence was equally in support of continental drift on a globe with a stable radius  During the thirties up to the late fifties  works by Vening Meinesz  Holmes  Umbgrove  and numerous others outlined concepts that were close or nearly identical to modern plate tectonics theory  In particular  the English geologist Arthur Holmes proposed in 1920 that plate junctions might lie beneath the sea  and in 1928 that convection currents within the mantle might be the driving force  40  Often  these contributions are forgotten because  At the time  continental drift was not accepted  Some of these ideas were discussed in the context of abandoned fixistic ideas of a deforming globe without continental drift or an expanding Earth  They were published during an episode of extreme political and economic instability that hampered scientific communication  Many were published by European scientists and at first not mentioned or given little credit in the papers on sea floor spreading published by the American researchers in the 1960s  Mid oceanic ridge spreading and convection For more details on Mid ocean ridge  see Seafloor spreading  In 1947  a team of scientists led by Maurice Ewing utilizing the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution s research vessel Atlantis and an array of instruments  confirmed the existence of a rise in the central Atlantic Ocean  and found that the floor of the seabed beneath the layer of sediments consisted of basalt  not the granite which is the main constituent of continents  They also found that the oceanic crust was much thinner than continental crust  All these new findings raised important and intriguing questions  41  The new data that had been collected on the ocean basins also showed particular characteristics regarding the bathymetry  One of the major outcomes of these datasets was that all along the globe  a system of mid oceanic ridges was detected  An important conclusion was that along this system  new ocean floor was being created  which led to the concept of the  Great Global Rift   This was described in the crucial paper of Bruce Heezen  1960  42  which would trigger a real revolution in thinking  A profound consequence of seafloor spreading is that new crust was  and is now  being continually created along the oceanic ridges  Therefore  Heezen advocated the so called  expanding Earth  hypothesis of S  Warren Carey  see above   So  still the question remained  how can new crust be continuously added along the oceanic ridges without increasing the size of the Earth  In reality  this question had been solved already by numerous scientists during the forties and the fifties  like Arthur Holmes  Vening Meinesz  Coates and many others  The crust in excess disappeared along what were called the oceanic trenches where so called  subduction  occurred  Therefore  when various scientists during the early sixties started to reason on the data at their disposal regarding the ocean floor  the pieces of the theory fell quickly into place  The question particularly intrigued Harry Hammond Hess  a Princeton University geologist and a Naval Reserve Rear Admiral  and Robert S  Dietz  a scientist with the U S  Coast and Geodetic Survey who first coined the term seafloor spreading  Dietz and Hess  the former published the same idea one year earlier in Nature  43  but priority belongs to Hess who had already distributed an unpublished manuscript of his 1962 article by 1960  44  were among the small handful who really understood the broad implications of sea floor spreading and how it would eventually agree with the  at that time  unconventional and unaccepted ideas of continental drift and the elegant and mobilistic models proposed by previous workers like Holmes  In the same year  Robert R  Coats of the U S  Geological Survey described the main features of island arc subduction in the Aleutian Islands  His paper  though little noted  and even ridiculed  at the time  has since been called  seminal  and  prescient   In reality  it actually shows that the work by the European scientists on island arcs and mountain belts performed and published during the 1930s up until the 1950s was applied and appreciated also in the United States  If the Earth s crust was expanding along the oceanic ridges  Hess and Dietz reasoned like Holmes and others before them  it must be shrinking elsewhere  Hess followed Heezen suggesting that new oceanic crust continuously spreads away from the ridges in a conveyor belt like motion  And  using the mobilistic concepts developed before  he correctly concluded that many millions of years later  the oceanic crust eventually descends along the continental margins where oceanic trenches   very deep  narrow canyons   are formed  e g  along the rim of the Pacific Ocean basin  The important step Hess made was that convection currents would be the driving force in this process  arriving at the same conclusions as Holmes had decades before with the only difference that the thinning of the ocean crust was performed using the mechanism of Heezen of spreading along the ridges  Hess therefore concluded that the Atlantic Ocean was expanding while the Pacific Ocean was shrinking  As old oceanic crust is  consumed  in the trenches   like Holmes and others  he believed this was done by thickening of the continental lithosphere  not  as nowadays believed  by underthrusting at a larger scale of the oceanic crust itself into the mantle  new magma rises and erupts along the spreading ridges to form new crust  In effect  the ocean basins are perpetually being  recycled   with the creation of new crust and the destruction of old oceanic lithosphere occurring simultaneously  in a way that later would be called the Wilson cycle  see below   Thus  the new mobilistic concepts neatly explained why the Earth does not get bigger with sea floor spreading  why there is so little sediment accumulation on the ocean floor  and why oceanic rocks are much younger than continental rocks  Magnetic striping For more details on this topic  see Vine Matthews Morley hypothesis  Seafloor magnetic striping  A demonstration of magnetic striping   The darker the color is the closer it is to normal polarity  Beginning in the 1950s  scientists like Victor Vacquier  using magnetic instruments  magnetometers  adapted from airborne devices developed during World War II to detect submarines  began recognizing odd magnetic variations across the ocean floor  This finding  though unexpected  was not entirely surprising because it was known that basalt the iron rich  volcanic rock making up the ocean floor contains a strongly magnetic mineral  magnetite  and can locally distort compass readings  This distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners as early as the late 18th century  More important  because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties  these newly discovered magnetic variations provided another means to study the deep ocean floor  When newly formed rock cools  such magnetic materials recorded the Earth s magnetic field at the time  As more and more of the seafloor was mapped during the 1950s  the magnetic variations turned out not to be random or isolated occurrences  but instead revealed recognizable patterns  When these magnetic patterns were mapped over a wide region  the ocean floor showed a zebra like pattern  one stripe with normal polarity and the adjoining stripe with reversed polarity  The overall pattern  defined by these alternating bands of normally and reversely polarized rock  became known as magnetic striping  and was published by Ron G  Mason and co workers in 1961  who did not find  though  an explanation for these data in terms of sea floor spreading  like Vine  Matthews and Morley a few years later  45  The discovery of magnetic striping called for an explanation  In the early 1960s scientists such as Heezen  Hess and Dietz had begun to theorise that mid ocean ridges mark structurally weak zones where the ocean floor was being ripped in two lengthwise along the ridge crest  see the previous paragraph   New magma from deep within the Earth rises easily through these weak zones and eventually erupts along the crest of the ridges to create new oceanic crust  This process  at first denominated the  conveyer belt hypothesis  and later called seafloor spreading  operating over many millions of years continues to form new ocean floor all across the 50 000 km long system of mid ocean ridges  Only four years after the maps with the  zebra pattern  of magnetic stripes were published  the link between sea floor spreading and these patterns was correctly placed  independently by Lawrence Morley  and by Fred Vine and Drummond Matthews  in 1963 46  now called the Vine Matthews Morley hypothesis  This hypothesis linked these patterns to geomagnetic reversals and was supported by several lines of evidence  47  the stripes are symmetrical around the crests of the mid ocean ridges  at or near the crest of the ridge  the rocks are very young  and they become progressively older away from the ridge crest  the youngest rocks at the ridge crest always have present day  normal  polarity  stripes of rock parallel to the ridge crest alternate in magnetic polarity  normal reversed normal  etc    suggesting that they were formed during different epochs documenting the  already known from independent studies  normal and reversal episodes of the Earth s magnetic field  By explaining both the zebra like magnetic striping and the construction of the mid ocean ridge system  the seafloor spreading hypothesis  SFS  quickly gained converts and represented another major advance in the development of the plate tectonics theory  Furthermore  the oceanic crust now came to be appreciated as a natural  tape recording  of the history of the geomagnetic field reversals  GMFR  of the Earth s magnetic field  Nowadays  extensive studies are dedicated to the calibration of the normal reversal patterns in the oceanic crust on one hand and known timescales derived from the dating of basalt layers in sedimentary sequences  magnetostratigraphy  on the other  to arrive at estimates of past spreading rates and plate reconstructions  Definition and refining of the theory After all these considerations  Plate Tectonics  or  as it was initially called  New Global Tectonics   became quickly accepted in the scientific world  and numerous papers followed that defined the concepts  In 1965  Tuzo Wilson who had been a promotor of the sea floor spreading hypothesis and continental drift from the very beginning 48  added the concept of transform faults to the model  completing the classes of fault types necessary to make the mobility of the plates on the globe work out  49  A symposium on continental drift was held at the Royal Society of London in 1965 which must be regarded as the official start of the acceptance of plate tectonics by the scientific community  and which abstracts are issued as Blacket  Bullard  amp  Runcorn  1965   In this symposium  Edward Bullard and co workers showed with a computer calculation how the continents along both sides of the Atlantic would best fit to close the ocean  which became known as the famous  Bullard s Fit   In 1966 Wilson published the paper that referred to previous plate tectonic reconstructions  introducing the concept of what is now known as the  Wilson Cycle   50  In 1967  at the American Geophysical Union s meeting  W  Jason Morgan proposed that the Earth s surface consists of 12 rigid plates that move relative to each other  51  Two months later  Xavier Le Pichon published a complete model based on 6 major plates with their relative motions  which marked the final acceptance by the scientific community of plate tectonics  52  In the same year  McKenzie and Parker independently presented a model similar to Morgan s using translations and rotations on a sphere to define the plate motions  53  Implications for biogeography Continental drift theory helps biogeographers to explain the disjunct biogeographic distribution of present day life found on different continents but having similar ancestors  54  In particular  it explains the Gondwanan distribution of ratites and the Antarctic flora  Plate reconstruction Main article  Plate reconstruction Reconstruction of plate configurations for the whole Phanerozoic Reconstruction is used to establish past  and future  plate configurations  helping determine the shape and make up of ancient supercontinents and providing a basis for paleogeography  Defining plate boundaries Current plate boundaries are defined by their seismicity  55  Past plate boundaries within existing plates are identified from a variety of evidence  such as the presence of ophiolites that are indicative of vanished oceans  56  Past plate motions Tectonic motion first began around three billion years ago  57  Various types of quantitative and semi quantitative information are available to constrain past plate motions  The geometric fit between continents  such as between west Africa and South America is still an important part of plate reconstruction  Magnetic stripe patterns provide a reliable guide to relative plate motions going back into the Jurassic period  58  The tracks of hotspots give absolute reconstructions but these are only available back to the Cretaceous  59  Older reconstructions rely mainly on paleomagnetic pole data  although these only constrain the latitude and rotation  but not the longitude  Combining poles of different ages in a particular plate to produce apparent polar wander paths provides a method for comparing the motions of different plates through time  60  Additional evidence comes from the distribution of certain sedimentary rock types  61  faunal provinces shown by particular fossil groups  and the position of orogenic belts  59  Formation and break up of continents The movement of plates has caused the formation and break up of continents over time  including occasional formation of a supercontinent that contains most or all of the continents  The supercontinent Columbia or Nuna formed during a period of 2 000 to 1 800 million years ago and broke up about 1 500 to 1 300 million years ago  62  The supercontinent Rodinia is thought to have formed about 1 billion years ago and to have embodied most or all of Earth s continents  and broken up into eight continents around 600 million years ago  The eight continents later re assembled into another supercontinent called Pangaea  Pangaea broke up into Laurasia  which became North America and Eurasia  and Gondwana  which became the remaining continents   Current plates Main article  List of tectonic plates Depending on how they are defined  there are usually seven or eight  major  plates  African  Antarctic  Eurasian  North American  South American  Pacific  and Indo Australian  The latter is sometimes subdivided into the Indian and Australian plates  There are dozens of smaller plates  the seven largest of which are the Arabian  Caribbean  Juan de Fuca  Cocos  Nazca  Philippine Sea and Scotia  The current motion of the tectonic plates is nowadays revealed from remote sensing satellite data sets  calibrated with ground station measurements  Other celestial bodies  planets  moons  The appearance of plate tectonics on terrestrial planets is related to planetary mass  with more massive planets than Earth expected to exhibit plate tectonics  Earth may be a borderline case  owing its tectonic activity to abundant water  63   Silica and water form a deep eutectic   Venus See also  Geology of Venus Venus shows no evidence of active plate tectonics  There is debatable evidence of active tectonics in the planet s distant past  however  events taking place since then  such as the plausible and generally accepted hypothesis that the Venusian lithosphere has thickened greatly over the course of several hundred million years  has made constraining the course of its geologic record difficult  However  the numerous well preserved impact craters have been utilized as a dating method to approximately date the Venusian surface  since there are thus far no known samples of Venusian rock to be dated by more reliable methods   Dates derived are dominantly in the range 500 to 750 million years ago  although ages of up to 1 200 million years ago have been calculated  This research has led to the fairly well accepted hypothesis that Venus has undergone an essentially complete volcanic resurfacing at least once in its distant past  with the last event taking place approximately within the range of estimated surface ages  While the mechanism of such an impressive thermal event remains a debated issue in Venusian geosciences  some scientists are advocates of processes involving plate motion to some extent  One explanation for Venus  lack of plate tectonics is that on Venus temperatures are too high for significant water to be present  64   65  The Earth s crust is soaked with water  and water plays an important role in the development of shear zones  Plate tectonics requires weak surfaces in the crust along which crustal slices can move  and it may well be that such weakening never took place on Venus because of the absence of water  However  some researchers remain convinced that plate tectonics is or was once active on this planet  Mars See also  Geology of Mars Mars is considerably smaller than Earth and Venus  and there is evidence for ice on its surface and in its crust  In the 1990s  it was proposed that Martian Crustal Dichotomy was created by plate tectonic processes  66  Scientists today disagree  and believe that it was created either by upwelling within the Martian mantle that thickened the crust of the Southern Highlands and formed Tharsis 67  or by a giant impact that excavated the Northern Lowlands  68  Observations made of the magnetic field of Mars by the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft in 1999 showed patterns of magnetic striping discovered on this planet  Some scientists interpreted these as requiring plate tectonic processes  such as seafloor spreading  69  However  their data fail a  magnetic reversal test   which is used to see if they were formed by flipping polarities of a global magnetic field  70  Galilean satellites of Jupiter Some of the satellites of Jupiter have features that may be related to plate tectonic style deformation  although the materials and specific mechanisms may be different from plate tectonic activity on Earth  Titan  moon of Saturn Titan  the largest moon of Saturn  was reported to show tectonic activity in images taken by the Huygens Probe  which landed on Titan on January 14  2005  71  Exoplanets It is believed that many planets around other stars will have plate tectonics  On Earth sized planets  plate tectonics is more likely if there are oceans of water  72  but on larger super earths plate tectonics is very likely even if the planet is dry  63  See also Geosyncline theory Supercontinent cycle Geological history of Earth List of plate tectonics topics Tectonics References Notes   Little  Fowler  amp  Coulson 1990    Read  amp
