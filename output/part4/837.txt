collapsed 14 1 miles  22 7 km  upstream from the city during heavy rains  At least 2 209 people died as a result of the flood and subsequent fire that raged through the debris  Other major floods occurred in 1936 and 1977  Despite a pledge by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to make the city flood free  and subsequent work to do so  another major flood occurred in 1977  The 1977 flood   in what was to have been a  flood free  city   may have contributed to Johnstown s subsequent population decline and inability to attract new residents and businesses  The city is home to five national historic districts  the Downtown Johnstown Historic District  Cambria City Historic District  Minersville Historic District  Moxham Historic District  and Old Conemaugh Borough Historic District  Individual listings on the National Register of Historic Places are the Grand Army of the Republic Hall  Cambria Iron Company  Cambria Public Library Building  Bridge in Johnstown City  Nathan s Department Store  and Johnstown Inclined Railway  3   edit  1800s This home was impaled on a tree by the raging waters of the 1889 Johnstown flood  Johnstown was formally organized as a town in 1800 by the Swiss German immigrant Joseph Johns  n  Josef Schantz   The settlement was initially known as Schantzstadt  but was soon anglicized to Johnstown  From 1834 to 1854  the city was a port and key transfer point along the Pennsylvania Main Line Canal  Johnstown was at the head of the canal s western branch  with canal boats having been transported over the mountains via the Allegheny Portage Railroad and refloated here  to continue the trip by water to Pittsburgh and the Ohio Valley  Perhaps the most famous passenger via the canal to visit Johnstown briefly was Charles Dickens in 1842  By 1854  canal transport became redundant with the completion of the Pennsylvania Railroad  which now spanned the state  With the coming of the railroads  the city s growth did not miss a beat  in fact  the tempo was stepped up  Johnstown became a stop on the main line of the Pennsylvania Railroad and was connected with the Baltimore  amp  Ohio  The railroads provided large scale development of the region s mineral wealth  Iron  coal  and steel quickly became central to the town of Johnstown  By 1860  the Cambria Iron Company of Johnstown was the leading steel producer in the United States  outproducing steel giants Pittsburgh and Cleveland  Through the second half of the 19th century  Johnstown made much of the nation s barbed wire  Johnstown prospered from skyrocketing demand in the western United States for barbed wire  Twenty years after its founding  the Cambria Works was a huge enterprise sprawling over 60 acres  240 000 m2  in Johnstown and employing 7 000  It owned 40 000 acres  160 km2  of valuable mineral lands in a region with a ready supply of iron  coal and limestone  Floods were almost a yearly event in the valley during the 1880s  On the afternoon of May 30  1889  following a quiet Memorial Day ceremony and a parade  it began raining in the valley  The next day water filled the streets and rumors began stating that a dam holding an artificial lake in the mountains to the northeast might give way  The dam gave way and an estimated 20 million tons of water began spilling into the winding gorge that led to Johnstown some 14 miles  23 km  away  The destruction in Johnstown occurred in only about 10 minutes  What had been a thriving steel town with homes  churches  saloons  a library  a railroad station  electric street lights  a roller skating rink  and two opera houses was buried under mud and debris  At least 2 209 people are known to have perished in the disaster  An infamous site of a major fire during the flood was the old stone Pennsylvania Railroad bridge located where the Stonycreek and Little Conemaugh Rivers form the Conemaugh River  The bridge still stands today  4  The Johnstown Flood established the American Red Cross as the pre eminent emergency relief organization in the United States  Founder Clara Barton  then 67  came to Johnstown with 50 doctors and nurses and set up tent hospitals as well as temporary  hotels  for the homeless  and stayed on for five months to coordinate relief efforts  5  The mills were back in operation within a month  The Cambria Works grew  and Johnstown became more prosperous than ever  The disaster had not destroyed the community but strengthened it  Later generations would draw on lessons learned in 1889   edit  1900s Johnstown was a remarkably prosperous hard working city during the inter war years  In the early 20th century  the population reached 75 000 people  Its public transportation was considered one of the best of any small city in the United States  The city s first commercial radio station  WJAC  began broadcasts in 1925  The downtown boasted at least five major department stores  including Glosser Brothers  which in the 1950s gave birth to the Gee Bee chain of department stores  However  the St  Patrick s Day 1936 Flood combined with the gnawing effects of the Great Depression left Johnstown struggling again  but only temporarily  Johnstown s citizens mobilized to achieve a permanent solution to the flooding problem and wrote to President Franklin Roosevelt pleading for Federal aid  Starting in August 1938  continuing for the next five years  the U  S  Army Corps of Engineers gouged widened  deepened  and realigned 9 2 miles  14 8 km  of channel in the city  and encased the river banks in concrete and reinforced steel  In a campaign organized by the Chamber of Commerce  thousands of Johnstown s citizens wrote to friends and relatives across the country hoping to bring new business to the town  Professional hockey would find a home in Johnstown  starting in 1941 with the Johnstown Blue Birds for one season and returning in 1950 with the Johnstown Jets  The Jets later hosted an exhibition game against Maurice Richard and the Montreal Canadiens on November 20  1951  The memory of floods was virtually purged from the community s consciousness  Newcomers to the town heard little about the tragic past  Johnstown proclaimed itself  flood free   a feeling reinforced when Johnstown was virtually the only riverside city in Pennsylvania not to flood during Hurricane Agnes in 1972  The immediate post WWII years mark Johnstown s peak as a steel maker and fabricator  At its peak  steel provided Johnstowners with more than 13 000 full time  well paying jobs  However  increased domestic and foreign competition  coupled with Johnstown s relative distance from its primary iron ore source in the western Great Lakes  led to a steady decline in profitability  New capital investment waned  Johnstown s mountainous terrain  and the resulting poor layout for the mills  physical plant strung along 11 miles  18 km  of river bottom lands  compounded the problem  New regulations ordered by the EPA in the 1970s also hit Johnstown with its aging plant especially hard  A community with a lesser tradition might have reacted with despair  Instead  with encouragement from the steel company  the city fathers organized an association called Johnstown Area Regional Industries  JARI  and  within a year  raised  3 million for industrial development in the area  Bethlehem Steel  which was the major contributor to the fund  committed itself to bringing new steelmaking technologies to Johnstown because they were impressed by the city s own efforts to diversify  Extensive damage from the 1977 flood was heavy and there was talk of the company pulling out  Again  the city won a reprieve from the company s top management  which had always regarded the Johnstown works with special affection because of its history and reputation  As the increasing amount of federal environmental regulations became more difficult to comply with and the issues with the aging manufacturing facilities  in 1982  steel companies began closing down plants all over the country  it looked as if Johnstown had exhausted its appeals  By the early 1990s  Johnstown abandoned most of its steel production  although some limited fabrication work continues  View of the city of Johnstown from atop the Inclined Plane   edit  2000s In 2003  U S  Census data showed that Johnstown was the least likely city in the United States to attract newcomers  however  what were previously relatively weak opportunities provided by the local manufacturing and service economies have more recently begun to burgeon  attracting outsiders  Gamesa Corporaci n Tecnol gica

Technology Complex that will house a division of Northrop Grumman  among other tenants signal the increasing dependence of Johnstown s economy on the U S  government s defense budget  The high tech defense industry is now the main non health care staple of the Johnstown economy  with the region pulling in well over  100M annually in Federal government contracts  punctuated by one of the premier defense trade shows in the U S   the annual Showcase For Commerce  Johnstown remains a regional medical  educational  cultural  and communications center  As in many other locales  health care provides a significant percentage of the employment opportunities in the city  The region is located right in the middle of the  Health Belt   an area stretching from the Midwest to New England and down the East Coast that has had massive growth in the health care industry  Incredible progress is being made at Memorial Medical Center and Windber Medical Center  especially at the Laurel Highlands Neuro Rehabilitation Center and the John P  Murtha Neuroscience and Pain Institute  with its advances in treating wounded veterans  and the Joyce Murtha Breast Care Center s focus on early diagnosis and advanced treatment  Downtown Johnstown from street view  The University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown and Pennsylvania Highlands Community College both attract thousands of students to their

artist zone and a traditional neighborhood zone to encourage both artistic endeavors and the old fashioned  Mom and Pop  enterprises that had difficulty thriving under the previous code  The Bottleworks Ethnic Arts Center offers many exhibitions  events  performances  and classes that celebrate the rich and diverse cultural heritage of the Area  The Johnstown Chiefs hockey team managed to provide affordable family entertainment to the region for 22 seasons  the longest period a franchise of the league stayed in one city  The Chiefs were a member team of the ECHL  the premier  AA  hockey league in North America  and played their home games in the Cambria County War Memorial Arena  The Chiefs decision to relocate caused a flood of public interest in the sport of hockey  As many as 4 leagues were interested in having a team in the War Memorial  In the end the city landed a deal with another ECHL team the Wheeling Nailers  The CJL Engineering Office Building at 232 Horner Street was awarded a LEED Silver Certification by the U S  Green Building Council  USGBC  on March 30  2010  It is the first fully certified LEED building in Johnstown  The recently established ART

200 000 participants enjoyed the 2008 edition of Thunder In The Valley and the event continues to grow in size  Significant and largely successful efforts have been made to deal with deteriorating housing  brownfields  drug problems  and other issues as population leaves the city limits and concentrates in suburban boroughs and townships  The Johnstown Fire Department has become a leader in developing intercommunication systems among first responders  and is now a national model for ways to avoid the communications problems which faced many first responders during the September 11  2001 attacks   edit  2010s The Ultimate Indoor Football League is a new indoor football league that has formed for the 2011 season  The leagues first team will call Johnstown home as announced by the

1977 s Slap Shot  directed by George Roy Hill and featuring Paul Newman as an aging hockey player coach  The screenplay by Nancy Dowd was a parody loosely based on the real life Johnstown Jets hockey team and its North American Hockey League championship in 1976  In the movie  Johnstown was rechristened  Charlestown  and the Jets as the Charlestown Chiefs  The film s premiere engendered some local controversy  as some thought Johnstown was portrayed in a less than flattering light  The name  Charlestown  itself is believed to be a reference to Charles Kunkle  an influential local businessman of the era  Slap Shot has since become the iconic movie about hockey and its foibles  Nancy Dowd would revive the fake town of  Charlestown  in her screenplay for the 1981 punk rock satire Ladies and Gentlemen  The Fabulous Stains  but the film itself was shot in Canada  The second major film was All the Right Moves  a high school football drama set in the fictional town of Ampipe and featuring

Academy Award for Best Documentary  Short Subject in 1989  The film was commissioned by the Johnstown Flood Museum Association  which later reorganized as the Johnstown Area Heritage Association  and is shown every hour at the Johnstown Flood Museum  Mystery novel writer K C  Constantine fictionalized many elements of Johnstown and its culture as  Rocksburg  in his novels  although the nearby city of Greensburg  Pennsylvania also provides some of the lore for Rocksburg  In 2000  Kathleen Cambor published In Sunlight  In A Beautiful Garden  The novel followed its characters through the events leading up to and including the 1889 flood  Although the protagonists in the novel were fictional  several historical figures  such as Andrew Mellon  Henry Clay Frick and Daniel Morrell were also

returning home from the Iraq War and coming to terms with a life without a limb  The song was inspired by actual reservists from Johnstown whom Hawkins met during a USO sponsored performance at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington D C  In addition to international radio play  the song was also featured prominently in John Murtha s 2007 re election campaign for the seat he held in the House of Representatives for almost 30 years  Hawkins toured extensively raising funds and awareness for the Intrepid Fallen Heros Fund that donated directly to injured soldiers who were left without health
