durability of the banknotes  The banknotes are made with the process of heating  to create a unique type of pulp  The minimum security features for naked eyes are watermarks  electrotypes and security

Buddhist Sailendra dynasty  and were produced in Indonesia until the twelfth century  gold and silver massa  emas is the modern Indonesian word for  gold   and kupang  Also used in this period were  Mutisalah   strings of beads of Indo Pacific origins  produced by the Sumatran Srivajaya empire  which spread to Borneo  Java  and to the eastern Indonesian islands in the 13th century  8  While the eastern islands continued to preserve the beads as heirlooms until the present day  using Chinese made beads after the defeat of Srivajaya  The Majapahit empire  which became predominant in Java and Sumatra from the late 13th Century  received with the arrival of Chinese traders  holed copper coins known as cash  These were later mimicked in Indonesia using tin or lead  When Europeans began arriving in Indonesia  they brought with them gold coins from Portugal and Venice  and silver Spanish dollars from Mexico  Peru and Bolivia  the latter becoming the predominant trade coin in the archipelago for several hundred years  The Dutch East India Company was granted a trade monopoly over the Indies in 1600  and under the leadership of Jan Pieterszoon Coen  gained effective government over the territory around Batavia on Java  their capital  with an area of influence that increased over time  and which was eventually expanded by Dutch conquest into the 20th Century to include nearly all of what is now Indonesia  The Dutch East India Company in the 17th century imported chiefly silver coin  in the form of Dutch small silver 1  2  and 6 stuiver coins  as well as the Spanish dollar  the most popular trade coin  and Dutch trade coinage  They helped provide smaller change by selling tin to the cash mints  but generally did not produce or import it themselves  Due to a lack of tin supply  in 1724 the Company began to produce its own copper coins   VOC  branded duit coins  which were minted in six provinces of The Netherlands  and imported in vast numbers over the 18th and into the 19th century  There were intermittent efforts at VOC branded silver coinage  but mostly imported Dutch and Spanish silver  which had a higher value in the Indies  was used  Although most coin was imported   chiefly  silver and also some gold  rupee  coins were minted locally in the 18th and early 19th century  The first bank paper appeared with the formation of the De Bank Courant en Bank van Leening in 1752  and a number of issues were made over the next sixty years  which all tended to lose value over time due to lack of coin to back the paper  The VOC went bankrupt in 1800 and the territories were nationalised by the then government  the Batavian Republic  which issued its own duits and made an issue of silver gulden coins in 1802  Duits were minted in large numbers in Surabaya between 1814 and 1840  with silver imported from the Netherlands  In 1854  the Netherlands Indies Guilder Gulden was decimalised  the duit replaced by the cent  and a series of coins from 1 2 cent up to 1 4 gulden was issued  all of which were minted in The Netherlands  Larger denominations   1 2  1 and 2  gulden in silver  and 5 and 10 gulden in gold were of regular Dutch issue  and circulated alongside the lower denominated Indies coinage  This same series of coinage continued to be issued until independence in 1945  The government put a stop to the inflationary bank paper with an issue of government paper in 1815  withdrawn on June 30  1861  De Javasche Bank  the central bank of the Netherlands Indies  eventually to become Bank Indonesia  was established in 1828  subject to much stricter regulation than previous banks  and remained solvent   edit  1942 1949 Japanese invasion  and Indonesian independence   the dawn of hyperinflation in Indonesia  edit  The Japanese invasion One Gulden note  Japanese occupation currency  Dutch East Indies In 1942  the Japanese invaded the Netherlands Indies  taking control of the whole country  and Netherlands New Guinea  by March 1942  On their invading ships  they brought their own issue of the local money  the gulden  They liquidated the banks  including  De Javasche Bank   and voided debt obligations  9  The notes issued by  De Japansche Regeering   the Japanese government  would be legal tender from March 1942  although the existing notes remained valid   with notes printed from 1 cent to 10 gulden  by the new  as of April 1942  circulating bank Nanpo Kaihatsu Ginko  The Japanese money was supposed to have the same value as the old Dutch money  with the old money to be recalled from use  but the invaders soon printed excessive quantities of money  and it was quickly apparent that hyperinflation was in progress  and hence people hoarded the Dutch money  By the end of the War  the Japanese had caused a massive increase in the paper money supply  which was 230 million gulden pre war  to several billion post war  This  plus the actions of the post war Dutch administration  caused massive inflation and damage to the stability and economy of the country  As their occupation continued  by 1944 the Japanese had determined that their long term strategic interests were best furthered by encouraging Indonesian nationalism  and so it issued a second series of notes printed in Indonesian language  the Netherlands Indies roepiah  Existing stocks of notes continued remained in use by the new Indonesian government until they had printed their own money in 1946  while the notes actually continued to be printed until early 1946 in parts of Eastern Indonesia  where the Nationalists did not have control   as a temporary measure until the Dutch had re established their pre war administration across the scattered islands   edit  Dutch Allied re occupation The Dutch government  which was in exile in London  had been making preparations for the end of the war  whereupon it hoped to regain control over its colony  In order to do so  in recognition of the fundamentally altered financial conditions under which they would be issued  it was anticipated that a governmental issue would be needed  in view of the weakened position of the private De Javasche Bank  which had previously been issuing banknotes  The notes were ordered in December 1942  printed in the USA by the Security Bank Note Printing Company  The notes were dated  March 1943  and labelled as  Nederlandsch Indische Gouvernementsgulden  printed in Dutch  along with the additional Indonesian text indicating the denomination of the notes and the word  roepiah   Denominations were 50 sen to 500 gulden  At the end of the war  the Allies  Netherlands Indies Civil Administration   army   began to retake control of the old East Indies  It began issuing the 1943 dated money  the  NICA gulden    starting from 1944 in New Guinea  and subsequently in Maluku and Borneo  both of which were recaptured before the Japanese surrender on August 14  1945  In areas under NICA control  pre war Dutch notes were demonetized  Despite the fact that NICA had control over the outer parts of Indonesia  its authority to dictate the value of money was limited by the economic weakness of the administration and of The Netherlands itself  As a compromise NICA re monetized the pre war notes of 10 gulden and below  higher valued notes not re issued to reduce the inflationary effect of having the pre war currency as well as new NICA money in circulated  With the Japanese surrender  the administration was given official control of the institutions of the country by the Allies  and DJB  which had survived the war better than expected  was reincorporated on 10 October 1945  Although the military action of the Allies in Eastern Indonesia and Kalimantan  Borneo  had introduced the NICA gulden into circulation in those areas  the transition back to Dutch control was not going to occur smoothly in the main islands of Java and Sumatra  and Allied military action gained control only over a few coastal enclaves  where Japanese money  large quantities of which were in storage by the Japanese   The  uang merah    red money   the 10 rupiah note was red  and there may also be a reference to blood  as the money was unpopular with the Indonesian revolutionaries   faced nationalist opposition to the principle of money issued by the Dutch  exarcebated by the fact that in spite of stated intentions to adopt a less colonial stance post war  the notes had been printed in Dutch with a large picture of the Dutch Queen Wilhelmina  When the first NICA money appeared in Java  Sukarno issued an immediate decree  of October 2  1945  to declare that the NICA notes were illegal  With the lack of the kind of control needed to issue money effectively  the Dutch determined that it would be inadvisable to issue NICA money in the towns of Java and Sumatra  and prohibited their import  With Japanese still acting as local government in Java and Sumatra  it was necessary for NICA to preserve the value of the Japanese money as much as possible  since it was the only means for them to pay the bills incurred in maintaining order  In many cases  the Japanese were instructed to simply print more money  and the Japanese currency in circulation continued to increase rapidly  the Japanese originated inflation continued with increased pace  By February 1946  2 billion Japanese money out of 2 5 billion captured in the state printers  had been spent  a vast sum against the entire pre war circulation of less than 500 million gulden  Due to the dwindling supplies of money  destruction of the printing plates at the main printers for re issue  and disquiet amongst European forces at payment in Japanese money  which was losing value constantly  it was finally decided to issue the NICA gulden in Java on 6 March 1946  Pre war notes of 5 gulden and below only were to retain validity  and the Japanese money was to be exchanged at a rate of 33 to 1  This action enraged the Indonesians  who imposed a 5 year prison sentence on its use  One army regiment even went as far as to execute people carrying the money  hoisting their bodies in public with the money pinned onto them  Due to the difficulties associated with using the money  the supply of food and basic goods from the Republican interior was poor  and the NICA money by June 1946 had fallen to a black market value of just 10 of the Japanese money  which was still the preferred money throughout Java   despite Dutch attempts to enforce the rate   edit  The first Indonesian rupiah   in Java Although the Republican government was firmly opposed to the use of the Dutch NICA money  seeing its exclusion as an important tool in the fight with the Dutch  the issue of its own money was slightly more considered  After their October 2 proclamation on NICA money  it declared the next day  that Japanese money as well as pre NICA Dutch money would be legal tender in the Republic  with both holding the same value  despite the greatly inflated quantity of Japanese money circulating  reflecting in part the fact that the Dutch money was no longer backed by gold reserves  the gold having been evacuated in the early part of the war  The Indonesians had been advised by the British that an issue of Indonesian money would be financial and political suicide  but their resolve was firm  Their first notes  dated 1945  were in preparation when the Indonesian printing works and all the money in it was seized by the Allies  which at this point included in the British  tasked with restoring order  in their successful assault on Jakarta in January 1946  The printing plates survived the attack  and with the Dutch decision to finally introduce the NICA gulden to Java in March 1946 seen as an offensive act  the Indonesians pressed ahead with the reprinting  an act spurred  as with the Dutch  by the dwindling supplies of Japanese money from the vaults of the banks in the cities they controlled  approximately 600 million Japanese roepiah   With Indonesian resources increasingly poorly matched against the Dutch  and only the small G  Kolff  amp  Co Malang printers at their disposal to print the money  printing of the money took several months  to July 1946  The Republican government declared that the new central bank of Indonesia would be Bank Negara Indonesia  established on 5 July 1946  occupying the offices of De Javasche Bank in Yogyakarta  the stronghold of the republic  Consequently  the Indonesian rupiah was finally first issued by proclamation of October 3  1946  In the year or so prior  the Japanese money had been a vital conduit of Republican goods to the Dutch enclaves  but the decree bought this to an end  all Japanese money was to be deposited with Republic banks by October 30  1946  Providing the depositors could account for how the money was obtained  they would be entitled to new new  Oeang Republik Indonesia   ORI  at the rate of 50 Japanese rupiah to 1 rp ORI  Outstanding debts were revalued according to their date of origin  with debts arising prior to 1943  before the Japanese induced inflation  converted at par  debts from 1943 1945 at 20 to 1  and those arising that year at the same 50 to 1 ratio  This deflationary policy had been derived from the Dutch geldzuivering of Dutch Minister of Finance Pieter Lieftinck  later Executive Director of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund  IMF    who had trained Sumitro Djojohadikusumo  who had returned to Indonesia along with many other educated Indonesians after the War  in economics at university in The Netherlands  As in The Netherlands  each citizen was to be issued with 1 rp to kick start the circulation of new money  Undeposited money after October was declared worthless  One rupiah of the new money was said to be worth 0 5 grams of gold  a similar rate to the pre war Dutch currency  which contained 3 grams of fine gold in the 5 gulden and 6 in the 10 gulden coin   although this was not backed by metal reserves  merely a proclamation of purchasing power  Due to a fear that the deposited money would not be returned  there was panic buying of goods in the days following the decree  and prices of food  in Japanese money  soared by up to 30 times  with the black market exchange rate to the NICA gulden rising to 120 to 1  With the end of Japanese money in the main Republican stronghold in Java as a conduit between the Republican interior and Dutch enclaves  the Dutch were forced to act  ending the exchange of Japanese money on October 30  1946  to avoid a flood of unexchanged Japanese money being brought for exchange with NICA gulden  Thus in Java at this point two currencies circulated  the 1943 dated Dutch NICA gulden  in Dutch controlled areas  and the 1945 dated ORI in the Indonesian enclaves  The Indonesian resistance was highly fragmented  strongest in rural villages  and lacking the ability to supply money across its extent  the Japanese money continued to be used in Banten  West Java  as well as all of republican Sumatra  There was never an official exchange rate between NICA gulden and Indonesian rupiah  but with popular support for the rupiah strong  1 ORI rupiah was initially valued at 5 NICA gulden  The currency  however  depreciated fast  falling to 2 gulden within 1 week  as the market gauged fair value  and by the end of 1946 to par  By March 1947  it was worth half a gulden  and by July 0 3 gulden  This inflation was caused by the Republican government  which was printing money to meet its obligations in the face of limited income of its own  By January 1947  310 million rupiah had been printed in republican Java alone  half the entire pre war gulden money supply  Due to the limited printing capacity of the government  it focused printing on 100 rupiah notes  Limited supply of smaller notes meant that the 100 rupiah notes were worth less than a combination of smaller notes  Rampant forgery only served to exacerbate the inflation of the Indonesian money  Despite laws put in place to stop hoarding of goods  confidence in the currency could not be maintained  In Jakarta  the Indonesian money was worth even less than elsewhere  as a consequence of the demand for NICA denominated imported goods  Republican attempts to maintain the value of Indonesian money  which was largely backed by the supply of rice from inner Java  could only slow  rather than stop  its decline  Over the years of the Indonesian revolution  three further issues of banknotes followed all emanating from Yogyakarta  two in 1947 alone  with the fourth  much more limited in number  being issued in 1948   edit  Dutch money of 1947 1949 New money was issued by the Dutch from July 1947  in the form of fully Dutch Indonesian bilingual gulden roepiah notes from  De Javasche Bank   These notes were dated 1946  and consisted of 5  violet   10  violet   25  red  gulden notes  The supply of these soon exhausted  and the administration remonetized all of the pre War DJB and government money as well  circulating unissued paper still stored in the vaults  This caused a 50  increase in the amount of money in circulation from 1947 to 1949  The administration also issued bronze and silver coins in the original pre war denominations  minted from 1943 to 1945 in the USA  but due to inflation  the coins were worth more as scrap  and many were melted into household goods and silver artefacts  As a result  it issued treasury notes instead  from December 1  1947  in 10 and 25 sen denominations  These notes were successful as they were in Indonesian  with Dutch and Indonesian on the reverse  and stated to have been issued by  Indonesia   being NICA   and continued to be utilised by the Indonesian government even after independence  until 1951  when Indonesia acquired its first coins   edit  Local banknotes of Republic of Indonesia  1947 1949 As the Republican government never had effective control of Indonesia beyond Java  from 1947 it legislated on 26 August 1947 that regional outposts in Sumatra and Java could issue their own money to replace the Japanese money  with exchange for true ORI envisaged when peacetime eventually enabled it  in part to inhibit the circulation of NICA gulden  At least thirty different towns and districts in Sumatra issued their own money  with around a dozen towns in Java doing so  starting with Banten in December 1947  The notes were marked with the place of issue and were in different designs from the national money   edit  1949 1958  Recognition of independence  and the new  Indonesian rupiah   edit  1950 1952 Indonesian independence recognised In November 1949  the Dutch Indonesian Round Table Conference held in The Hague  brokered peace and recognition independence for the Indonesian state  as the Republik Indonesia Serikat  United States of Indonesia   a federation of states consisting of the Republic of Indonesia  republican Java and Sumatra   along with fifteen other states  But on August 15  2005  the Dutch have officially recognized the Independence of Indonesia at 17 August 1945  as it is the date of proclamation of Independence of Indonesia  As part of the accord  it was provided that The Netherlands was to retain economic influence over the republic until Indonesia had paid the debt run up by NICA in fighting the war with Indonesia  It was agreed that private Dutch owned De Javasche Bank was to be restored as the central bank of Indonesia  despite resentment among Indonesian nationalists  the Indonesian established BNI becoming a development bank  10  A brief issue of notes was issued by the  Republic Indonesia Serikat   from June 1950  consisting of 5 and 10 rupiah notes  but with the merger of the separate states into the Republic of Indonesia in March and April 1950  with the formal declaration of the sole Republic of Indonesia confirmed on August 17  1950  this money was short lived   edit  The Sjafruddin cut The new  Republik Indonesia Serikat  decided to address the amount of money circulating  due to the treaty the government was required to accept the NICA gulden as legal tender as well   which had reached 3 9 billion rupiah  A bewildering variety of money was in circulation  including local and national rupiah  Japanese  pre war  and NICA Dutch monies  Due to the large amount of currency  the minister of finance  Sjafruddin Prawiranegara  sought to reduce the money supply by one half  11  This reform was decreed from 19 March 1950  People were to cut all of their notes of 5 gulden and up in half  with the left half to be replaced with new banknotes  and the right half for a government bond with a 3  coupon  In addition  half of all bank deposits over 400 rupiah were also to be forcibly used to buy the government bonds  As part of the exchange  local and Republik Indonesia money was also demonetized  with all old Republik Indonesia notes no longer valid after May 1  1950  125 Rp of the first  Republik Indonesia  rupiah  issued in Java  was exchanged for 1 Rp of new DJB notes  Higher exchange rates were in place for local currencies  some of which had been heavily devalued by the over printing of money by the army  The recently devalued Rupiah Baru of Aceh were exchangeable at 1 75 to 1   edit  1951  Nationalisation of De Javasche Bank   transformation to Bank Indonesia Due to the desire to remove the influence of the DJB  which was dominated by Dutch  and was felt to be unwanted foreign influence on the country  and the inflamed tensions caused by the refusal of the Dutch to transfer the territory of Dutch New Guinea to the Republic  the government moved to nationalize the Dutch bank  This action  announced on 30 April 1951  involved the repeal of the old Java Bank Law of 1922  preventing non Dutch citizens from owning shares in the bank  and negotiations with the Amsterdam Stock Exchange  The purchase was agreed at 120  of the value of the bank  which was valued at 9 million Dutch gulden   with Dutch opinion holding that the bank was properly an Indonesian asset  and hence nationalisation was a valid action  The nationalisation was completed on 15 December 1951  with DJB becoming a government institution of Indonesia  In addition to this act of nationalisation  on 3 October 1951  the republic passed an Emergency Act on valid currency  in order to repeal the Indische Muntwet Act of 1912  which still governed valid currency in Indonesia  The consequence of the new Act was that old Dutch coins would be void for payment  12  and Indonesian rupiah coins would be issued with values of 1  5  10  25  and 50 sen under the remit of the Indonesian government  Low denomination Dutch banknotes were to be withdrawn in due course  This Act saw the first Republik Indonesia money being issued  of 1 and 2  rupiah denominations  continuing the split between denominations of under 5 gulden and 5 and above between state and central bank intitiated by the Dutch   edit  1953 1958  Bank Indonesia born In order that it could discontinue the issue of the resented  De Javasche Bank  money  the government completed the Indonesianisation of DJB  with the bank becoming Bank Indonesia on 1 July 1953 via the Principal Act on Bank Indonesia 1953  The bank had responsibility for the issue of banknotes of 5 rupiah and above  as had DJB   and the first Bank Indonesia money appeared from 1953   edit  1959 1965  currency devaluation and spiralling inflation The economy was ravaged by inflation  and prices had tripled from 1953 to 1959  and Soekarno wanted to devalue the currency  Disagreement over this policy led to the end of Loekman Hakim as Governor Bank Indonesia on 31 July 1959  He was replaced by Soetikno Slamet  With the unwilling ex governor replaced  the official exchange rate was devalued on August 1  1959 by 75  from 11 4 to 45 to the US   the unofficial rate  was around half of that  and it had been 3 8 to the dollar in 1949   In addition  the 500 Rp and 1000 Rp notes were devalued 90  on 24 August 1959 to 50 and 100 Rp  The actual notes affected were the  1946  500 gulden  and the  1952  culture and the  animal  notes of 500 and 1000rp notes  Thus  as of September 1959  the largest note in circulation Indonesia was of 100 rupiah   edit  1965 1991  the 1000 to 1 revaluation of the rupiah Rampant inflation  which was 27  in 1961  but jumped to 174  in 1962  by 1965 was 600   had seen the largest denomination banknote increase 100 fold  from 100 rupiah in September 1959  to 1000 rupiah in May 1960  to 5 000 in October 1963 and finally 10 000 rupiah in August 1964  As a result  during the Indonesian political turmoil of 1965  the  new rupiah  was introduced on 13 December 1965  at a rate of 1000 of the old unit  13  The price index at the end of 1965 had been calculated at 363 times higher than in 1958  and prices had risen approximately seven times over the previous 12 months  14  In real terms  i e   with inflation taken into account   a labourer in Jakarta was estimated to have earned 40 per cent of his earnings in 1958  15  Although the devaluation in notes was 1 000 to 1  prices were reckoned to fall by only 10 times  16  This devaluation had the side effect of unifying the Indonesian Rupiah with the Riau rupiah  the Irian Barat rupiah lasted until 1971   17  Denominations of the new rupiah ranged from 1 sen  worthless even at issue  up to 100 rupiah  with 500 and 1000 rupiah added soon after  By 1968 the Suharto New Order had been established  and Bank Indonesia  as of 1968 was given sole right to issue banknotes  including notes below 5 rupiah  as well as coins  which had previously been the issue of the central government   which it did in a range from 1 to 1000 rupiah  17  In 1970  Indonesia added 5000 and 10000 rupiah banknotes to the range in 1970  while  with inflation finally under control  coinage was re introduced  starting at 1 rupiah  and ranging up to 100 rupiah  September 1975 saw sub 100 rupiah notes permanently withdrawn from circulation   edit  1992 1999  before and after the financial crisis By 1992  the rupiah was worth less than one fifth of what it had been worth when the 10 000 rupiah note had been introduced in 1970  and so a 20 000 rupiah note was produced  then the largest note ever seen in Indonesia  The Asian financial crisis of 1997 1998 reduced the rupiah s value by over 80  in a few months and was a major factor in the overthrow of President Suharto s government  The rupiah had traded at about 2000 3000 rupiah per 1 USD  but reached a low of 16 800 rupiah per dollar in June 1998  The currency  which had been relatively stable in prior years  had its value destroyed  The government did not take any action to demonetise or revalue the banknotes   Direksi 1998  merely redesigned the 10 000 and 20 000 rupiah notes   Direksi 1999  saw a new Soepratman design for the 50 000 rupiah  replacing the commemorative note of Suharto  who had resigned after more than 30 years as Indonesia s president in the wake of the crisis  The banknote lineup was extended with a new denomination of 100 000 rupiah in 1999  by then worth about US 12  500 million notes of the 100 000 rupiah polymer note were printed  to all be issued within a month of November 1999  18  This was part of Indonesia s millennium bug preparations  lest there should be a great demand for cash after the new year  Polymer was chosen because  according to Bank Indonesia  plastic would be harder to counterfeit and would last longer  However  the notes were not popular in banks as counting machines were unable to count them accurately and there have been issues with the money sticking to one another due to the heat of the machine  and Indonesia has reverted to the use of paper notes   edit  2000 2005  redesigns to all of Indonesia s denominations of banknotes  Direksi 2000  brought a new 1 000 rupiah note  with the 100 and 500 rupiah notes having been discontinued due to the dramatic devaluation of Indonesia s currency   Direksi 2001  redesigned the 5 000 rupiah  while  Direksi 2004  brought an end to the polymer 100 000 rupiah notes  replacing with a paper design  as well the issue of a new more secure 20 000 rupiah note  The most recent changes to Indonesian money were  Direksi 2005   which re designed the 10 000 and 50 000 rupiah note   edit  Plan to redenominate rupiah In August 2010 Bank Indonesia proposed to redenominate the rupiah by truncating the last three zero digits  dividing by 1000   The redenomination is meant to simplify daily transactions  which often run into millions of rupiah  The plan under consideration would be completed by 2015 at the soonest  but more likely by 2020  It would reduce the exchange rate with the US dollar from about 9 000 rupiah to 9  19  The plan has raised public concern that the monetary policy may devalue the currency  Bank Indonesia Governor Darmin Nasution immediately announced that the planned redenomination of the national currency would not inflict any financial losses as the measure would only strike a few zeros from the current denominations  20   edit  Exchange Rate and inflation The rupiah has been subject to high inflation for most of its existence  which as an internationally recognised currency should be dated to 1950   Various attempts have been made to maintain the value of the currency  all were abandoned   edit  1946 1949 revolutionary period In the period from October 1946 to March 1950 Indonesian currency had no international recognition  Its value was determined on the blackmarket   edit  1949 1965 foreign exchange restrictions The exchange rate determined upon independence in 1949 was 3 8 rupiah to one US   Lembaga Alat Alat Pembajaran Luar Negeri Publication  26 of March 11  1950  effective March 13  established the Foreign Exchange Certificate System  12  By the trade in certificates an export rate of 7 6rp and an import rate of 11 4rp was established  The FECS was scrapped on 4 January 1952  by which time the government had been able to reduce its deficit by 5 3 billion rupiah through the exchange differential  The system was scrapped because domestic prices were being determined by the import rate  which were hurting profits from exports earned at the lower rate  Hence the effective 7 6 11 4rp exchange rate reverted to 3 8rp  The ending of what amounted to an export tariff severely damaged government revenues  and as of 4 February 1952  the rupiah was officially devalued to 11 4rp  with export tariffs of 15 25  on commodities that Indonesia was strong in  Weaker commodities were not subject to tariffs  and from 1955 were actually given a premium of 5 25  to boost their export  In order to control foreign exchange  the government brought in a number of measures  40  of the foreign exchange requirements of importers were required to be paid to the government from April 1952  while as from September 1952 the government decided to provide only a limited amount of foreign exchange  made available every four months  These foreign exchange restrictions  designed to provide the government with much needed reserves meant that some companies were operating at as low as 20  of capacity  due to lack of needed imported materials  Further foreign exchange restrictions were introduced over 1953 1954  with April 1953  the foreign exchange downpayment was increased to 75   except for raw materials at 50   Foreign companies and their workers were placed under restrictions as to the amount of foreign exchange that could be sent home  with the amounts allowed out subject to fees of 66    As of November 1954  exporters were required to sell 15  of their foreign exchange earned to the government  An increasingly complex set of tariffs on imports were unified in September 1955 with a set of Extra Import Duties  requiring downpayments to the government of 50   100   200   or 400  of the value of the goods  The official 11 4 rp rate  which massively overvalued the rupiah  was a major incentive to black market traders  and also contributed to anti Java feeling  given that those producing raw materials on the large material rich outer islands were not receiving fair value from their goods due to the exchange rate  diverting funds to the government Java  The black market rate at the end of 1956 was 31rp  falling to 49rp at the end of 1957  and 90rp by the end of 1958  In response to Sumatra and Sulawesi refusing to hand over their foreign exchange  in June 1957 a new system for foreign exchange was introduced  exporters received export certificates  BE  representing the foreign currency earned and could sell them to importers on the free market  but subject to a 20  tax   This effectively created a freely floating rupiah  The price of the certificates quickly reached 332  of face by April 1958  i e   38rp  a rate at which the government chose to end the free market  fixing the price at 332  of face value  The currency devaluation of large notes in 1959 saw the official exchange rate devalued to 45rp as of August 1959  Despite this  the fundamental issues with the fixed exchange rate system and severe import controls  which saw cotton mills running at only 11  of capacity due to lack of imported raw materials  were not addressed  and smuggling grew  often backed by the army  while assets were moved offshore by overinvoicing  The government maintained price controls over goods and raw materials  with the official oil price unchanged 1950 1965  After the 1959 devaluation  inflation  which had been running at a relatively high 25  per annum 1953 1959 really took off  with rates over 100  in 1962  1963  and 1964  and 600  in 1965  Despite the official 45rp to 1 US  rate  two further export certificate trading systems  of March 1962   May 1963  and then from April 1964 onwards  showed premiums of 2 678  July 1962  1205rp effective rate   5 100  August 1965  2295rp  and 11 100  in November 1965  4995rp   21   edit  1966 1971 stabilization and growth The last demonetization of rupiah notes occurred in late 1965  at which time inflation was ravaging the economy  exports had dropped 24  1959 1965  GDP growth was below population growth  and the foreign exchange reserves had fallen by over 90   Inflation in 1965 was 635   In late 1965  the  new rupiah  was brought in  at 1000 to 1 to the old currency  The official exchange rate was set initially at 0 25rp to 1 US  as of 13 December 1965  a rate that did not represent reality  as the multiple exchange rate system remained in place for the time being  This was followed by the emergence of Suharto  who as of 11 March 1966 acquired executive control of Indonesia  Suharto quickly made economic changes  establishing his  New Order   with economic policy set by the Berkeley Mafia  his team of US educated neoclassical economists  The policy began to be set out in November 1966  following the reaching of agreement with Indonesia s creditors in October 1966 on debt relief and loan restructuring  Economic policies were put in place to require adequate bank reserves  ending subsidies on consumer goods  end import restrictions  and to devalue the rupiah  The 1966 1970 stabilization program was a great success  resulting in higher economic growth  boosting legal exports  which grew 70  in US  terms over the period   and increasing output  for instance the price of oil rose 250 times when the 1950 prices were abandoned  incentivising new exploration   By 1971 inflation had fallen to just 2   Despite the liberalisation efforts  Indonesia still had multiple exchange rates  A more realistic exchange rate was finally established of 378  new  rupiah to 1 US  as of April 1970  In August 1971 the exchange rate was devalued slightly  to 415rp to the US    edit  Fixed rate period 1971 1978 The 415 rupiah exchange rate to the US dollar  which had been established in August 1971 was fixed by government intervention in the currency market  buying and selling currency as needed  22  Despite the fixed rate  the failure of the rice crop in 1972  exarcebated by high world rice prices  and underordering by the government rice cartel  along with rising commodity prices caused inflation to rise above 20  in 1972  peaking at over 40  in 1974  The M1 money supply increased sharply over the period due to lax credit controls  which was channeled towards favoured groups  such as pribumi  non Chinese Indonesians   as well as corrupt government linked businesses  23  Despite the high inflation of the period  the exchange rate  which had essentially been preserved using the country s oil exports  was maintained at 415 rupiah until 15 November 1978   edit  Managed float period 1978 1997  edit  1978 1986 devaluations By 1978  the combination of a fall in oil prices and a decrease in foreign reserves meant that the rupiah was devalued 33  to 625rp to 1 US  on 16 November 1978  although prices had increased nearly fourfold over the period   The government abandoned the fixed exchange rate  and altered economic policy to a form of a managed float  The exchange rate was published each day  At the point of devaluation  November 1978   the trade weighted real  local price adjusted  effective exchange rate  REER  of the rupiah  23  against major world currencies was just over twice as high as it was in 1995  prior to the Asian economic crisis  and free fall of the rupiah   i e  the rupiah was highly overvalued at this point  By March 1983  the managed float had brought only an 11  fall in three and a half years to 702rp  The continued overvaluation of the rupiah meant that Indonesia was beginning to suffering a trade deficit  as well as falling foreign exchange reserves  The government responded by devaluing the currency on 30 March by 28  to 970rp  At this time the 1980s oil glut put the Indonesian economy was under pressure  with exports uncompetitive as a result of the overvalued currency  and oil contributing less as a result of lower global prices  On 1 June 1983   Pakjun 1983  brought deregulation of the banking system  and the end of the meaningless 6  official deposit rate  with a more market based financial system  Credit ceilings were removed  Interest rates  initially 18   remained above 15  over the period  By September 1986 the currency had been allowed to steadily fall to 1134 rupiah  a rate which had largely maintained purchasing power over the period  Despite this  the currency was devalued 30  on 12 September 1986 to 1664 rupiah to 1 US   As in 1983  this had been intended to boost the balance of trade  oil prices   29 in 1983  fell by 50  in 1986 alone  to below  9 per barrel  Thus in the period from 1978 to 1986  the real exchange rate of the Indonesian rupiah fell by more than 50   providing significant boosts to the competitivity of Indonesia s exports   edit  October 1986   June 1997  US  real exchange parity Although the devaluations of 1978  1983 and 1986 had each successfully boosted the competitiveness of exports  devaluations have a destabilizing effect  and the September 1986 devaluation was the last carried out by Indonesia  According to research  24  despite an official 7 currency exchange basket  empirical evidence suggests that the rupiah was controlled by Bank Indonesia against the US  alone  and indeed since the 1986 devaluation  the currency maintained near constant purchasing power against the dollar up until the 1997 crisis  the steady fall of the rupiah against the dollar essentially representing the delta of Indonesian inflation above US inflation  hence  by June 1997 the rupiah had fallen from its post devaluation rate of 1664rp to 2350rp  an annualized decline of slightly over 3    edit  Asian Financial Crisis  and response  1997 1999  edit  First stage of the crisis   limited initial falls The Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 began in Thailand  where the Thai Baht  fixed at 25 THB to 1 USD  came under attack in May 1997  By 2 July 1997 Thailand abandoned its defence of the baht  allowing it to float freely  Indonesia  which had massive foreign reserves and was seen as having a strong economy  responded on July 11  1997  by widening its exchange rate band from 8 to 12   Indonesia had taken similar actions previously  in December 1995 from 2 to 3   in response to the Mexican financial crisis  and in June and September 1996 from 3 to 5  and then 5 to 8   These actions had been successful in the past in defending the rupiah  but on this occasion there was a more serious crisis of confidence  The rupiah fell 7  immediately  with foreign money quick to leave the country  with investor confidence in Indonesia shaken  due to previous deregulations  much of the Indonesian stockmarket was owned by foreign investors   Local confidence in the currency was also undermined as the population decided to follow suit  selling rupiah for dollars  The spot rate soon fell below the selling rate  i e  outside the 12  exchange rate band   and despite Bank Indonesia s attempts to intervene  it soon abandoned the managed float  leaving the rupiah to float freely on August 14  1997  The rate  2436 on July 11  was 2663 on August 14  and 2955 on August 15  a 12  fall  Government debt  Bank Indonesia Certificates or SBI  rose from 12  to 30   and overnight call rates reached 81   per annum    edit  Response to the falls   crisis At this stage the crisis was a limited one  while the currency had fallen  the extent of the fall did not look to be catastrophic  The government announced its response in September  the banking sector was to be restructured  government projects would be cancelled  and some banks were supported with liquidity from the government  The government reduced the SBI rate three times in September to around 20   As of 24 September  the exchange rate still lingered around 3000  at 2990  The government response to the crisis sent mixed messages  with falling interest rates doing nothing to support confidence in the rupiah  and the rupiah continued to be sold  as companies who had been borrowing heavily in dollars had to meet their obligation  By October 4  the rupiah had collapsed a further 19   falling to 3690 rupiah  The rupiah had now lost a third of its value  and there was now a full blown  krisis  in Indonesia  On 8 October with the rupiah at 3640  the government decided to seek the support of the IMF  The rupiah fluctuated in the 3300 3650 range during October awaiting the IMF s response  The response was announced on 1 November 1997  Sixteen small and insolvent banks would be closed  with a small market share of only 2 5   Deposits would be underwritten up to 20 million rupiah  90  of all depositors had less than this in the bank   Private banks would be subject to improved monitoring  and some state banks would be merged  The rupiah immediately gained almost 10  against the dollar  to around 3300  as the markets signalled their approval  Soon after  however  confidence began to fall  The IMF response had only been published in summary form from the government and Bank Indonesia  and the choice of the sixteen banks being closed appeared arbitrary  and the details of the thirty four others subject to special measures was not announced  The deposit guarantee of 20 million rupiah was seen as inadequate  and funds were moved from private to state banks  exchanged for dollars  or transferred offshore  as confidence in the plan began to evaporate  The rupiah steadily weakened from the middle of November  standing at 3700 rupiah at the end of the month  In December the crisis turned into a disaster  Much of the Indonesian economy was controlled  indeed  in 2008  much of it still is  by relatives of the President Suharto  and of the sixteen banks to be liquidated  PT Bank Andromeda was 25  owned by Bambang Trihatmodjo  the second son of Suharto  PT Bank Jakarta was part owned by Probosutedjo  the President s half brother  and PT Bank Industri was 8  owned by the President s second daughter  Siti Hediati Prabowo  25  The President and his family were opposed to the reforms  with Bambang Trihatmodjo beginning legal action against the government to keep his bank  particularly as directors of the insolvent banks were  if culpable  to be added to a Disgraced Persons List  ineligible to work in the banking sector  Although the bank had violated its BMPK  credit limit   Bambang was given permission by Bank Indonesia to buy Bank Alfa  another bank  seen by many as a reward for withdrawing his lawsuit  In effect  the failed bank was reopened under a different name  It was clear that the cronyism and corruption of Indonesia was winning over IMF reforms  The rupiah fell from 4085 to 5650 in the space of a single week  By the middle of the month  half the banking system  154 banks  had suffered bank runs  By Christmas Eve the rupiah stood at 5915  a fall of 60  since July  The New Year saw the rupiah begin at 5447  On January 15 a second Letter of Intent was signed with the IMF  agreeing an accelerated reform package in return for  43 billion of aid  The rupiah had strengthened from an all time low of 9100 on 23 January to 7225 on 15 January  but it soon became clear Suharto had no intention of fulfilling the agreement  The rupiah plummeted by more than 50   bottoming out at 14800 on January 23  The amount of liquidity pumped into the banking system was by now over 60 trillion rupiah  causing money supply increases and worsening inflation  The government announced a rescue package on 26 January  26  ensuring that the government would guarantee all existing deposits  The Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency was set up with the goal of merging  closing  or recapitalising  before sale  banks  Fifty four banks  four state  fifty private   representing nearly 40  of the sector were placed under IBRA supervision in February 1998  with a resulting strengthening of the rupiah to 7400  Despite the improvements  it was not long before confidence was undermined again  as Suharto discussed a currency board  the IBRA head was replaced  and political instability increased  The currency fell to around 10000  Indonesia began to take more drastic action  doubling its SBI rates to 45   increasing the cost of its lending   and in April  having signed a third Letter of Intent with the IMF  the IBRA took over the major private banks  twinning the banks with state banks  and suspending the owners  control  The rupiah  which had strengthened to around 8000  depreciated in the wake of the Jakarta riots of May 1998  and in particular the run on the Bank Central Asia  Indonesia s largest private bank that ensued  causing the bank to be taken over by IBRA on 29 May  The SBI rate was increased to 70  in the wake of massive inflation  The end of Suharto s rule brought a new President  Jusuf Habibie  to power on 21 May 1998  Little action was seen immediately  and by 17 June the rupiah had bottomed out at 16800 rupiah  A fourth Letter of Intent was signed with the IMF  on June 25  1998  which was refusing to provide aid due to breaches of its original agreement  The IMF agreed to provide an immediate  5 billion of aid to cover basic necessities  Audits of the banks that had been taken over showed massive bad debts  exceeding 55   Further audits showed that the other banks were also fundamentally weak  Banking reform continued through to 1999  with the merger of 4 state banks in October 1998  into Bank Mandiri  the closure of 38 banks in March 1999  recapitalisation of 9  and take over of 7 more  By this point total bank capital had reached negative 245 trillion rupiah  23 further banks were recapitalised in May  and in October 1999 Bank Mandiri itself was recapitalised  Interest rates fell steadily in 1999  to an SBI of 13 1  in October  The rupiah finished the year at 7900 to the US Dollar  Despite the fall of the currency of about 70  from June 1997 to December 1998  inflation of 60 70   which caused riots  and the end of the Suharto regime after 30 years in power  in 1998 meant that the real exchange rate fell only slightly   edit  Rupiah since 1999  relative stability The rupiah declined from its relatively strengthened position at the end of the financial crisis  with the rupiah seeing in the century at 7 050 to the US   but declining to 9 725 by the end of 2000  and reaching a low of 12 069 on 27 April 2001  The currency strengthened to 8 500 later in 2001  but ended 2001 at 10 505  March 2002 saw the currency break below 10 000  from which point the currency maintained a rate in the 8000s and 9000s until August 2005  and in the latter half of that year  the trading range extended towards 11 000  but ending the year just below 10 000  2006 and 2007 saw the currency trade in a relatively narrow range against the US   which itself was depreciating against other currencies   of 8500 9900  This trend continued into 2008  with the currency trading between 9000 and 9500  27  The Financial crisis of 2007 2008 with the collapse in the commodities market saw the US  gain strongly against currencies backed by weakening commodities exports  With palm oil and rubber prices falling from their peak by more than half  the rupiah came under pressure  Bank Indonesia spent  7 billion of its  57 billion reserves in October defending the currency  28  Despite this  the rupiah slipped below 10 000 on 23 October for the first time since 2005  and then below 11 000 on 2 November  a mark last reached in 2001  On November 13  Bank Indonesia introduced new regulations requiring foreign currency purchases over  100 000 a month to be backed by documentation of an underlying transaction and a tax number  The rupiah closed below 12 000 for the first time since 1998 on 20 October  with intraday lows below 13 000 hit  Subsequently  however  the cut in the Federal Reserve rate to 0 0 25  and Bank Indonesia support for the currency  saw the rupiah strengthen slightly to a range around 11 000  The catastrophic damage to the rupiah caused in 1997 1998 severely damaged confidence in the currency  Even though the rupiah is freely convertible currency  it is still regarded as a risky currency to hold  As of 1 January 2011  2011  01 01
