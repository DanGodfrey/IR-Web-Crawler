Institute of Technology  also known as MIT  is a private research university located in Cambridge  Massachusetts  United States  MIT has five schools and one college  containing a total of 32 academic departments  with a strong emphasis on scientific and technological education and research  Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States  the institute adopted the European polytechnic university model and emphasized laboratory instruction from an early date  8  MIT s early emphasis on applied technology at the undergraduate and graduate levels led to close cooperation with industry  Curricular reforms under Karl Compton and Vannevar Bush in the 1930s re emphasized basic scientific research  9  MIT was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1934  Researchers were involved in efforts to develop computers  radar  and inertial guidance in connection with defense research during World War II and the Cold War  Post war defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under James Killian  The current 168 acre  68 0 ha  campus opened in 1916 and extends over 1 mile  1 6 km  along the northern bank of the Charles River basin  5  In the past 60 years  MIT s educational disciplines have expanded beyond the physical sciences and engineering into fields such as biology  economics  linguistics  political science  and management  MIT enrolled 4 384 undergraduates and 6 510 graduate students for the 2011 2012 school year  4  MIT received 17 909 applicants for the class of 2015  with only 1 742 offered admittance  an acceptance rate of 9 7   10  It employs around 1 000 faculty members  3  77 Nobel laureates  52 National Medal of Science recipients  45 Rhodes Scholars  and 38 MacArthur Fellows are

In 1859  the Massachusetts General Court was given a proposal for use of newly opened lands in Back Bay in Boston for a museum and Conservatory of Art and Science  17  On April 10  1861  the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts signed a charter for the incorporation of the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Boston Society of Natural History   submitted by William Barton Rogers  Rogers sought to establish a new form of higher education to address the challenges posed by rapid advances in science and technology during the mid 19th century with which classic institutions were ill prepared to deal  18  19  Barton believed   The true and only practicable object of a polytechnic school is  as I conceive  the teaching  not of the minute details and manipulations of the arts  which can be done only in the workshop  but the inculcation of those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them  their leading processes and operations in connection with physical laws   20  A 1905 map of MIT s Boston campus  The Rogers Plan  as it has come to be known  reflected the German research university model  emphasizing an independent faculty engaged in research as well as instruction oriented around seminars and laboratories  21  Rogers proposed that this new form of education be rooted in three principles  the educational value of useful knowledge  the necessity of  learning by doing   and integrating a professional and liberal arts education at the undergraduate level  22  23  However  open conflict in the Civil War broke out on April 12  1861  just two days after issuance of the charter  After years of delay caused by wartime funding and staffing difficulties  MIT s first classes were held in rented space at the Mercantile Building in downtown Boston in 1865  24  Though it was to be located in the middle of urban Boston  the mission of the new institute matched the intent of the 1862 Morrill Land Grant Colleges Act to fund institutions  to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes   Although the Commonwealth of Massachusetts separately founded what was to become the University of Massachusetts under this act  d  MIT was also named a land grant school  25  The proceeds from land sales went toward new buildings in Boston s Back Bay neighborhood in 1866  and MIT informally came to be called  Boston Tech   26  During the next half century  the focus of the science and engineering curriculum drifted towards vocational concerns instead of theoretical programs  During this period  the MIT faculty and alumni repeatedly rejected overtures from former MIT faculty turned Harvard University president Charles W  Eliot  to merge MIT with Harvard College s Lawrence Scientific

plaque of George Eastman  founder of Eastman Kodak  in Building 6  His nose is rubbed by students for good luck  29  Industrialist George Eastman reinforced MIT s independence by donating funds to build a new campus along a mile long tract on the Cambridge side of the Charles River  almost entirely on landfill  30  In 1916  MIT moved into the handsome new neoclassical campus designed by William W  Bosworth  In 1937  President Karl Taylor Compton and Vice President  effectively Provost  Vannevar Bush drastically reformed the applied technology curriculum by re emphasizing the importance of  pure  sciences like physics and chemistry and by reducing the vocational practice required in shops and drafting studios  9  In sharp contrast to the Ivy League  MIT catered more to middle class families  and depended more on tuition than on endowments or grants  31  Despite the challenges of the Great Depression  the Compton reforms  renewed confidence in the ability of the Institute to develop leadership in science as well as in engineering   22  The expansion and reforms cemented MIT s academic reputation 9  and the school was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1934  32  MIT was substantially changed by its involvement in military research during World War II  Vannevar Bush was appointed head of the enormous Office of Scientific Research and Development and directed funding to only a select group of universities  including MIT  33  34  MIT s Radiation Laboratory was established in 1940 to assist the British military in developing a microwave radar  and the first mass produced equipments were installed on front line units within months  Other defense projects included gyroscope based and other complex control systems for gun and bombsights and inertial navigation under Charles Stark Draper s Instrumentation Laboratory  the development of a digital computer for flight simulations under Project Whirlwind  and high speed and high altitude photography under Harold Edgerton  35  By the end of the war  MIT employed a staff of over 4 000  including more than a fifth of the nation s physicists  and was the nation s single largest wartime R amp D contractor  36  In the post war years  government sponsored research such as SAGE and guidance systems for ballistic missiles and Project Apollo  combined with surging student enrollments under the G I  Bill  contributed to rapid growth in the size of the Institute s research staff and physical plant  as well as placing an increased emphasis on graduate education  22  The profound changes that occurred at MIT between 1930 and 1957 included the doubling of its faculty and a quintupling of its graduate student population  These changes were significantly guided and shaped by the institution building strategies of Karl Taylor Compton  president of MIT between 1930 and 1948  James Rhyne Killian  president from 1948 to 1957  and Julius Adams Stratton  chancellor from 1952 to 1957  37  While the school mainly served the needs of industrial patrons in the 1920s  by the 1950s it had gained considerable autonomy from industrial corporations while attracting new patrons and building a close relationship with philanthropic foundations and the federal government  As the Cold War and Space Race intensified and concerns about the technology gap between the US and the Soviet Union grew more pervasive throughout the 1950s and 1960s  MIT s involvement in the military industrial complex was a source of pride on campus  38  39   edit  Recent history  1966 present  The MIT Media Lab houses researchers developing novel uses of computer technology  Shown here is the 1982 building  designed by I M  Pei  with an extension  background  designed by Fumiko Maki and opened in March 2010  Following a comprehensive review of the undergraduate curriculum in 1949 and the successive appointments of more humanistically oriented Presidents Howard W  Johnson and Jerome Wiesner between 1966 and 1980  MIT greatly expanded its programs in the humanities  arts  and social sciences  22  40  Previously marginalized faculties in the areas of economics  management  political science  and linguistics emerged into cohesive and assertive departments by attracting respected professors  launching competitive graduate programs  and forming into the School of Humanities  Arts  and Social Sciences and the MIT Sloan School of Management in 1950 to compete with the powerful Schools of Science and Engineering  41  42  In late 1960s and early 1970s  student and faculty activists protested against the Vietnam War and MIT s defense research  43  44  The Union of Concerned Scientists was founded on March 4  1969 during a meeting of faculty members and students seeking to shift the emphasis on military research towards environmental and social problems  45  Although MIT ultimately divested itself from the Instrumentation Laboratory and moved all classified research off campus to the Lincoln Laboratory facility in 1973 in response to the protests  46  47  the student body  faculty  and administration remained comparatively unpolarized during the tumultuous era  43  48  In addition to developing the predecessors to modern computing and networking technologies  49  50  students  staff  and faculty members at the Project MAC  Artificial Intelligence Laboratory  and Tech Model Railroad Club wrote some of the earliest interactive video games like Spacewar  and created much of modern hacker slang  51  Several major computer related organizations have originated at MIT since the 1980s  Richard Stallman s GNU Project and the subsequent Free Software Foundation were founded in the mid 1980s at the AI Lab  the MIT Media Lab was founded in 1985 by Nicholas Negroponte and Jerome Wiesner to promote research into novel uses of computer technology  52  the World Wide Web Consortium standards organization was founded at the Laboratory for Computer Science in 1994 by Tim Berners Lee  53  the OpenCourseWare project has made course materials for over 1 800 MIT classes available online free of charge since 2002  54  and the One Laptop per Child initiative to expand computer education and connectivity to children worldwide was launched in 2005  55  Upon taking office in 2004  President Hockfield launched an Energy Research Council to investigate how MIT can respond to the interdisciplinary challenges of increasing global energy consumption  56  MIT was named a sea grant college in 1976 to support its programs in oceanography and marine sciences and was named a space grant college in 1989 to support its aeronautics and astronautics programs  57  58  Despite diminishing government financial support over the past quarter century  MIT launched several development campaigns to significantly expand the campus  new dormitories and athletics buildings on west campus  the Tang Center for Management Education  several buildings in the northeast corner of campus supporting research into biology  brain and cognitive sciences  genomics  biotechnology  and cancer research  and a number of new  backlot  buildings on Vassar Street including the Stata Center  59  Construction on campus in the 2000s included an expansion of the Media Lab  the Sloan s eastern campus  and graduate residences in the northwest  60  61   edit  Campus Main article  Campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology The central and eastern sections of MIT s campus as seen from above Massachusetts Avenue and the Charles River  In the center is the Great Dome overlooking Killian Court with Kendall Square in the background  MIT s 168 acre  68 0 ha  campus spans approximately a mile of the north side of the Charles River basin in the city of Cambridge  The campus is divided roughly in half by Massachusetts Avenue  with most dormitories and student life facilities to the west and most academic buildings to the east  The bridge closest to MIT is the Harvard Bridge  which is known for being marked off in a non standard unit of length   the smoot  62  63  The Kendall MBTA Red Line station is located on the far northeastern edge of the campus in Kendall Square  The Cambridge neighborhoods surrounding MIT are a mixture of high tech companies occupying both modern office and rehabilitated industrial buildings as well as socio economically diverse residential neighborhoods  64  MIT buildings all have a number  or a number and a letter  designation and most have a name as well  65  Typically  academic and office buildings are referred to primarily by number while residence halls are referred to by name  The organization of building numbers roughly corresponds to the order in which the buildings were built and their location relative  north  west  and east  to the original  center cluster of Maclaurin buildings  65  Many are connected above ground as well as through an extensive network of underground tunnels  providing protection from the Cambridge weather as well as a venue for roof and tunnel hacking  66  67  MIT s on campus nuclear reactor is one of the largest university based nuclear reactors in the United States  68  The prominence of the reactor s containment building in a densely populated area has been controversial  69  but MIT maintains that it is well secured  70  Other notable campus facilities include a pressurized wind tunnel and a towing tank for testing ship and ocean structure designs  71  72  MIT s campus wide wireless network was completed in the fall of 2005 and consists of nearly 3 000 access points covering 9 400 000 square feet  870 000 m2  of campus  73  In 2001  the Environmental Protection Agency sued MIT for violating Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act with regard to its hazardous waste storage and disposal procedures  74  MIT settled the suit by paying a  155 000 fine and launching three environmental projects  75  In connection with capital campaigns to expand the campus  the Institute has also extensively renovated existing buildings to improve their energy efficiency  MIT has also taken steps to reduce its environmental impact by running alternative fuel campus shuttles  subsidizing public transportation passes  and building a low emission cogeneration plant that serves most of the campus electricity  heating  and cooling requirements  76  Between 2006 and 2008  MIT reported 16 forcible sex offenses  4 robberies  13 aggravated assaults  536 burglaries  2 cases of arson  and 16 cases of motor vehicle theft  77   edit  Architecture The Stata Center houses CSAIL  LIDS  and the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy MIT s School of Architecture  now the School of Architecture and Planning  was the first in the United States  78  and it has a history of commissioning progressive buildings  79  80  The first buildings constructed on the Cambridge campus  completed in 1916  are known officially as the Maclaurin buildings after Institute president Richard Maclaurin who oversaw their construction  Designed by William Welles Bosworth  these imposing buildings were built of concrete  a first for a non industrial   much less university   building in the US  81  The utopian City Beautiful movement greatly influenced Bosworth s design  which features the Pantheon esque Great Dome housing the Barker Engineering Library  The Great Dome overlooks Killian Court  where annual Commencement  graduation  exercises are held  The friezes of the limestone clad buildings around Killian Court are engraved with the names of important scientists and philosophers  k  The imposing Building 7 atrium along Massachusetts Avenue is regarded as the entrance to the Infinite Corridor and the rest of the campus  Alvar Aalto s Baker House  1947   Eero Saarinen s Chapel and Auditorium  1955   and I M  Pei s Green  Dreyfus  Landau  and Wiesner buildings represent high forms of post war modernist architecture  82  83  84  More recent buildings like Frank Gehry s Stata Center  2004   Steven Holl s Simmons Hall  2002   Charles Correa s Building 46  2005   Fumihiko Maki s Media Lab Extension  2009  are distinctive amongst the Boston area s classical architecture and serve as examples of contemporary campus  starchitecture   79  85  These buildings have not always been popularly acclaimed  86  87  in 2010  The Princeton Review included MIT in a list of twenty schools whose campuses are  tiny  unsightly  or both   88   edit  Housing Main article  Housing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Simmons Hall was completed in 2002 Undergraduates are guaranteed four year housing in one of MIT s 12 undergrad dormitories  although 8  of students live off campus or commute  89  On campus housing provides live in graduate student tutors and faculty housemasters who have the dual role of both helping students and monitoring them for medical or mental health problems  New undergrad students specify their dorm and floor preferences a few days after arrival on campus  and as a result diverse communities arise in living groups  e g  the dorms on and east of Massachusetts Avenue have typically been more involved in countercultural activities  90  MIT also has 5 dormitories for single graduate students and 2 apartment buildings on campus for married student families  91  MIT has a very active Greek and co op system which includes 36 fraternities  sororities  and independent living groups  FSILGs   92  50  of male undergraduates join a fraternity and 34  of women join sororities  93  Most FSILGs are located across the river in the Back Bay owing to MIT s historic location there  but eight fraternities are located on MIT s West Campus and in Cambridge  After the 1997 death of Scott Krueger  a new member at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity  MIT required all freshmen to live in the dormitory system starting in 2002  94  Because the fraternities and independent living groups had previously housed as many as 300 freshmen off campus  the new policy did not take effect until 2002 after Simmons Hall opened  95   edit  Organization and administration Building 7  at 77 Massachusetts Avenue  is regarded as the entrance to campus MIT is chartered as a non profit organization and is owned and governed by a privately appointed board of trustees known as the MIT Corporation  96  The current board consists of 43 members elected to five year terms  97  25 life members who vote until their 75th birthday  98  three elected officers  President  Treasurer  and Secretary   99  and four ex officio members including the president of the alumni association  the Governor of Massachusetts  the Massachusetts Secretary of Education  and the Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court  100  101  The board is chaired by John S  Reed  the former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange and Citigroup  102  103  The corporation approves the budget  new programs  degrees  and faculty appointments as well as electing the President to serve as the chief executive officer of the university and presiding over the Institute s faculty  64  104  The sixteenth and current president  Susan Hockfield  a molecular neurobiologist  succeeded Charles M  Vest s fourteen year tenure in December 2004 and is the first woman to hold the post  105  MIT s endowment and other financial assets are managed through a subsidiary MIT Investment Management Company  MITIMCo   106  Valued at  8 0 billion in 2009  MIT s endowment is the sixth largest among American colleges and universities  14  107  L  Rafael Reif a professor of Electrical Engineering is the current Provost of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  MIT is  a university polarized around science  engineering  and the arts   108  It has five schools  Science  Engineering  Architecture and Planning  Management  and Humanities  Arts  and Social Sciences  and one college  Whitaker College of Health Sciences and Technology   but no schools of law or medicine  109  e  The chair of each of MIT s 32 academic departments reports to the dean of that department s school  who in turn reports to the Provost under the President  110  However  faculty committees assert substantial control over many areas of MIT s curriculum  research  student life  and administrative affairs  111   edit  Collaborations Eero Saarinen s Kresge Auditorium  1955  is a classic example of the post war architecture The university historically pioneered research and training collaborations between the academy  industry and government  112  113  Fruitful collaborations with industrialists like Alfred P  Sloan and Thomas Alva Edison led President Compton to establish an Office of Corporate Relations and an Industrial Liaison Program in the 1930s and 1940s that now allows over 600 companies to license research and consult with MIT faculty and researchers  9  114  Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s  American politicians and business leaders accused MIT and other universities of contributing to a declining economy by transferring taxpayer funded research and technology to international   especially Japanese   firms that were competing with struggling American businesses  115  116  MIT s extensive collaboration with the federal government on research projects has also led to several MIT leaders serving as Presidential scientific advisers since 1940  j  MIT established a Washington Office in 1991 to continue to lobby for research funding and national science policy  117  118  In response to MIT  eight Ivy League colleges  and 11 other institutions holding  Overlap Meetings  to prevent bidding wars over promising students from consuming funds for need based scholarships  the Justice Department began an antitrust investigation in 1989 and in 1991 filed an antitrust suit against these universities  119  120  While the Ivy League institutions settled  121  MIT contested the charges on the grounds that the practice was not anti competitive because it ensured the availability of aid for the greatest number of students  122  123  MIT ultimately prevailed when the Justice Department dropped the case in 1994  124  125  Walker Memorial is a monument to MIT s 4th president  Francis Amasa Walker MIT s proximity to Harvard University i  has created both a quasi friendly rivalry   the other school up the river   and a substantial number of research collaborations such as the Harvard MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology and Broad Institute  126  127  In addition  students at the two schools can cross register for credits toward their own school s degrees without any additional fees  127  A cross registration program with Wellesley College has existed since 1969 and a significant undergraduate exchange program with the University of Cambridge known as the Cambridge MIT Institute was also launched in 2002  127  MIT has more modest cross registration programs with Boston University  Brandeis University  Tufts University  Massachusetts College of Art  and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts  Boston  127  MIT maintains substantial research and faculty ties with independent research organizations in the Boston area like the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory  Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research  and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as well as international research and educational collaborations through the Singapore MIT Alliance  MIT Politecnico di Milano  127  128  MIT Zaragoza International Logistics Program  and other countries through the MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives  MISTI  program  127  129  The mass market magazine Technology Review is published by MIT through a subsidiary company  as is a special edition that also serves as the Institute s official alumni magazine  The MIT Press is a major university press  publishing over 200 books and 40 journals annually emphasizing science and

beginning after Labor Day and ending in mid December  a 4 week  Independent Activities Period  in the month of January  and the spring semester beginning in early February and ending in late May  141  The School of Engineering has been ranked first among graduate and undergraduate programs by U S  News  amp  World Report since the first published results in 1994  142  143  MIT has also consistently ranked first in the Academic Ranking of World Universities in Engineering Technology and Computer Sciences  144  A 1995 National Research Council study of US research universities ranked MIT first in  reputation  and fourth in  citations and faculty awards  and a 2005 NBER study of high school students  revealed preferences found MIT to be the 4th most preferred college in the nation  145  146  MIT students refer to both their majors and classes using numbers or acronyms alone  147  Departments and their corresponding majors are numbered in the approximate order their foundation  for example  Civil and Environmental Engineering is Course I  while Nuclear Science  amp  Engineering is Course XXII  148  149  Students majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science  the most popular department  collectively identify themselves as  Course VI   MIT students use a combination of the department s course number and the number assigned to the class to identify their subjects  the introductory calculus based classical mechanics course is simply  8 01  at MIT  f   edit  Undergraduate program The four year  full time undergraduate instructional program is classified as  balanced arts  amp  sciences professions  and admission is characterized as  more selective  lower transfer in   138  MIT offers 44 undergraduate degrees across its five schools  150  In 2009  some 1 146 bachelor of science  abbreviated as SB  from the Latin expression Scienti  Baccalaureus  degrees were granted  the only type of undergraduate degree MIT now awards  151  152  The School of Engineering

extensive core curriculum called the General Institute Requirements  GIRs   154  The science requirement  generally completed during freshman year as prerequisites for classes in science and engineering majors  comprises two semesters of physics  two semesters of calculus  one semester of chemistry  one semester of biology  and a laboratory class in their major  The humanities  arts  and social sciences  HASS  requirement  consisting of eight semesters  includes a distribution of three classes across each of the humanities  arts  and social sciences as well as a concentration  The communication requirement consists of two communication intensive HASS classes and two classes in their major program  Finally  all students are required to complete a swimming test and non varsity athletes must also take four physical education classes  154  The Infinite Corridor is the primary passageway through campus Although the difficulty and especially the fast pace of MIT coursework has been characterized as  drinking from a fire hose   155  the freshmen retention rate at MIT is similar to other national research universities  156  Some of the pressure for first year undergraduates is lessened by the existence of the  pass no record  grading system  In the first  fall  term  freshmen transcripts only report if a class was passed while no external record exists if a class was not passed  In the second  spring  term  passing grades  ABC  appear on the transcript while non passing grades are again rendered  no record   157  The system had previously been  Pass No Record  all freshman year  but was amended for the Class of 2006 to prevent students from gaming the system by completing required major classes on a pass fail basis  158  Most classes rely upon a combination of faculty led lectures  graduate student led recitations  weekly problem sets  p sets   and tests to teach material  though alternative curricula exist  e g  Experimental Study Group  Concourse  and Terrascope  157  In the past  some organized student groups have compiled  course bibles   collections of problem set and examination questions and answers used as references for later students  In 1970  the then Dean of Institute Relations  Benson R  Snyder  published The Hidden Curriculum  arguing that unwritten regulations  like the implicit curricula of the bibles  are often counterproductive  they fool professors into believing that their teaching is effective and students into believing they have learned the material  For further coverage of this topic  see History of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Course  Bibles   In 1969  MIT began the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program  UROP  to enable undergraduates to collaborate directly with faculty members and researchers  The program  founded by Margaret MacVicar  builds upon the MIT philosophy of  learning by doing   Students join or initiate research projects  colloquially called  UROPs
