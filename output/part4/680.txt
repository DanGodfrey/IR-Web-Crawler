Rock of Polynesia   and inhabitants of the island call it  the Rock  for short  Niue is 2 400 kilometres  1 500 mi  northeast of New Zealand in a triangle between Tonga to the southwest  the Samoas to the northwest  and the Cook Islands to the southeast  The land area is 260 square kilometres  100 sq mi  with about 1 400 people who are predominantly Polynesian  Though self governing  Niue is in free association with New Zealand  and lacks full sovereignty  All Niueans are New Zealand citizens and Queen Elizabeth II is Niue s head of state in her capacity as Queen of New Zealand  Most diplomatic relations are conducted by New Zealand on Niue s behalf  90 95  of Niuean people live in New Zealand  3  along with about 70  of the speakers of the Niuean language  citation needed  In

the 16th century  5  Until the beginning of the 18th century  there appears to have been no national government or national leader  Before then  chiefs and heads of families exercised authority over segments of the population  Around 1700 the concept and practice of kingship appear to have been introduced through contact with Samoa or Tonga  From then a succession of patu iki  kings  ruled the island  the first of whom was Puni mata  Tui toga  who reigned from 1875 to 1887  was the first Christian king  6  The first European to sight Niue was Captain James Cook in 1774  Cook made three attempts to land on the island but was refused permission to do so by the Polynesian inhabitants  He named the island  Savage Island  because  legend has it  the natives that  greeted  him were painted in what appeared to Cook and his crew to be blood  However  the substance on their teeth was that of the hulahula  a native red banana  7  For the next couple of centuries the island was known as Savage Island  until its original name Niu    which translates as  behold the coconut   8  regained use  The next notable European visitors were from the London Missionary Society who arrived in 1846 on the  Messenger of Peace   After many years of trying to land a European missionary on Niue  a Niuean named Nukai Peniamina was taken to Samoa and trained as a Pastor at the Malua Theological College  citation needed  Peniamina returned as a missionary with the help of Toimata Fakafitifonua  He was finally allowed to land in Uluvehi Mutalau after a number of attempts in other villages had failed  The Chiefs of Mutalau village allowed Peniamina to land and assigned over 60 warriors to protect him day and night at the fort in Fupiu  Christianity was first taught to the Mutalau people before it was spread to all the villages on Niue  originally other major villages opposed the introduction of Christianity and had sought to kill Peniamina  The people from the village of Hakupu  although the last village to receive Christianity  came and asked for a  word of god   hence their village was renamed  Ha Kupu Atua  meaning  any word of god   or  Hakupu  for short  In 1887  King Fata a iki  who reigned from 1887 to 1896  offered to cede sovereignty to the British Empire  fearing the consequences of annexation by a less benevolent colonial power  The offer was not accepted until 1900  Niue was a British protectorate for a time  but the UK s direct involvement ended in 1901 when New Zealand annexed the island  Self government was granted by the New Zealand parliament with the 1974 constitution  following a referendum in Niue in 1974 whereby Niueans were given three options  independence  self government or continuation as a New Zealand territory  The majority selected self government and Niue s written constitution 9  was promulgated as supreme law  Robert Rex  ethnically part European  part native  was appointed the country s first premier  a position he held until his death 18 years later  Rex became the first Niuean to receive a knighthood  in 1984  In January 2004  Niue was hit by Cyclone Heta  which killed two people and caused extensive damage to the entire island  including wiping out most of the south of the capital  Alofi   edit  Politics Main article  Politics of Niue The Niue Constitution Act vests executive authority in Her Majesty the Queen in Right of New Zealand and the Governor General of New Zealand  The Constitution specifies that in everyday practice sovereignty is exercised by the Niue Cabinet of Ministers  comprising the premier and three other ministers  The premier and ministers are members of the Niue Legislative Assembly  the nation s parliament  The assembly consists of 20 democratically elected members  14 of whom are elected by the electors of each village constituency  six by all registered voters in all constituencies  Electors must be New Zealand citizens  resident for at least three months  and candidates must be electors and resident for 12 months  citation needed  Anyone born in Niue must register on the electoral roll  The Speaker is elected by the assembly and is the first official to be elected in the first sitting of the Legislative Assembly following an election  The new Speaker calls for nominations for premier  the candidate with the most votes from the 20 members is elected  The Premier selects three other members to form the Cabinet of Ministers  the executive arm of government  The other two organs of government  following the Westminster model  are the Legislative Assembly and the Judiciary  General elections take place every three years  most recently on 7 May 2011  The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature  Niue has a High Court  a Court of Appeal  and enjoys appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council  in London  10   edit  Geography Main article  Geography of Niue See also  List of villages in Niue Map of Niue Niue coastline Niue is a 269 km  raised coral atoll in the southern Pacific Ocean  east of Tonga  The geographic coordinates are 19 03 48 S 169 52 11 W     19 06333 S 169 86972 W     19 06333   169 86972  11  There are three geographically outlying coral reefs within the Exclusive Economic Zone that do not have any land area  Beveridge Reef  at 20 00 S  167 48 W  240 km southeast  submerged atoll drying during

metres in diameter  with a least depth of 9 5 metres Haran Reef  Harans Reef   at 21 33 S  168 55 W  reported to break furiously  294 km southeast Besides these  Albert Meyer Reef   20 53 S  172 19 W  almost 5 km long and wide  least depth 3 metres  326 km southwest  is not officially claimed by Niue  and the existence of Haymet Rocks   26 S  160 W  1273 km ESE  is in doubt  Niue is one of the world s largest coral islands  The terrain consists of steep limestone cliffs along the coast with a central plateau rising to about 60 metres above sea level  A coral reef surrounds the island  with the only major break in the reef being in the central western coast  close to the capital  Alofi  A notable feature is the number of limestone caves found close to the coast  The island is roughly oval in shape  with a diameter of about 18 kilometres   with two large bays indenting the western coast  Alofi Bay in the centre and Avatele Bay in the south  Between these is the promontory of Halagigie Point  A small peninsula  TeP  Point  Blowhole Point   is close to the settlement of Avatele in the southwest  Most of the population resides close to the west coast  around the capital  and in the northwest  Some of the soils are geochemically very unusual  They are extremely highly weathered tropical soils  with high levels of iron and aluminium oxides  oxisol  and mercury  and they contain surprisingly high levels of natural radioactivity  There is almost no uranium  but the radionucleides Th 230 and Pa 231 head the decay chains  This is the same distribution of elements as found naturally on very deep seabeds  but the geochemical evidence suggests that the origin is extreme weathering of coral and brief sea submergence 120 000 years ago  Endothermal upwelling  by which mild natural volcanic heat draws deep seawater up through the porous coral  may also contribute  12  No adverse health effects from the radioactivity or other trace elements have been demonstrated and calculations show that level of radioactivity would probably be much too low to be detected in the population  These unusual soils are very rich in phosphate  but it is not accessible to plants  being in the very insoluble form of iron phosphate  or crandallite  It is thought that rather similar radioactive soils may exist on Lifou and Mare near New Caledonia  and Rennell in the Solomon Islands  but no other locations are known  The time difference between Niue and mainland New Zealand is 23 hours during the Southern Hemisphere winter and 24 hours when the mainland uses Daylight Saving Time

and foreign affairs Main article  Foreign relations of Niue Niue has been self governing in free association with New Zealand since 3 September 1974 when the people endorsed the Constitution in a plebiscite  14  Niue is fully responsible for its internal affairs  Niue s position concerning its external relations is less clear cut  Section 6 of the Niue Constitution Act provides that   Nothing in this Act or in the Constitution shall affect the responsibilities of Her Majesty the Queen in right of New Zealand for the external affairs and defence of Niue   Section 8 elaborates but still leaves the position unclear  providing  Effect shall be given to the provisions of sections 6 and 7  concerning external affairs and defence and economic and administrative assistance respectively  of this Act  and to any other aspect of the relationship between New Zealand and Niue which may from time to time call for positive co operation between New Zealand and Niue after consultation between the Prime Minister of New Zealand and the Premier of Niue  and in accordance with the policies of their respective Governments  and  if it appears desirable that any provision be made in the law of Niue to carry out these policies  that provision may be made in the manner prescribed in the Constitution  but not otherwise   15  The island has a representative mission in Wellington  New Zealand  Niue is also a member of the Pacific Islands Forum and a number of regional and international agencies  It is not a member of the United Nations  but is a state party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  the Ottawa Treaty and the Treaty of Rarotonga  The country is a member state of UNESCO since 26 October 1993  16  Niue purported to establish diplomatic relations with the People s Republic of China on December 12  2007  17  However  in light of its Constitution it is uncertain whether Niue had the capacity to enter diplomatic relations with any country  Traditionally  Niue s foreign relations and defence have been regarded as the responsibility of New Zealand  which has full diplomatic relations with China  Furthermore the Joint Communique signed by Niue and China is different in its treatment of the Taiwan question from that agreed by New Zealand and China  New Zealand  acknowledged  China s position on Taiwan but has never expressly agreed with it  but Niue  recognizes that there is only one China in the world  the Government of the People s Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China and Taiwan is an inalienable part of the territory of China   17  Critics have asked whether Niueans can continue to benefit from free association with New Zealand and yet disregard New Zealand s advice and establish an independent foreign policy  18  The people of Niue have fought as part of the New Zealand army  In World War I  Niue sent about 200 soldiers as part of the Maori Battalion under New Zealand forces  19   edit  Economy Main article  Economy of Niue Alofi  the capital of Niue  Niue s economy is small  with a GDP of NZ 17 million in 2003  20  or US 10 million at purchasing power parity  21  Most economic activity revolves around the government  as the government was traditionally in charge of organising and managing the affairs of the new country since 1974  However  since the economy has reached a stage where state regulation may now give way to the private sector  there is an ongoing effort to develop the private sector  Following Cyclone Heta  the government made a major commitment towards rehabilitating and developing the private sector  citation needed  The government allocated  1 million for the private sector  which was spent on helping businesses devastated by the cyclone  and on the construction of the Fonuakula Industrial Park  This industrial park is now completed and some businesses are already operating from it  The Fonuakula Industrial Park is managed by the Niue Business Centre  a quasi governmental organisation providing advisory services to businesses  Most Niuean families grow their own food crops for subsistence and some are sold at the Niue Makete in Alofi  some exported to their families in New Zealand  citation needed  The Niuean taro is known in Samoa as  talo Niue  and in international markets as pink taro  Niue also exports taro to the New Zealand market  The Niue taro is a natural variety and is very resistant to pests  citation needed  The Niue Government and the Reef Group from New Zealand started two joint ventures in 2003 and 2004 involving the development of the fisheries and noni  Morinda citrifolia  a small tree with edible fruit   The Niue Fish Processors  Ltd is a joint venture company processing fresh fish  mainly tuna  yellow fin  big eye and albacore   for export to the overseas markets  NFP operates out of their state of the art fish plant in Amanau Alofi South  completed and opened in October 2004  citation needed  In August 2005  an Australian mining company  Yamarna Goldfields  suggested that Niue might have the world s largest deposit of uranium  By early September these hopes were seen as overoptimistic  22  and in late October the company cancelled its plans to mine  announcing that exploration drilling had identified nothing of commercial value  23  The Australian Securities and Investments Commission filed charges in January 2007 against two directors of the company  now called Mining Projects Group Ltd  alleging that their conduct was deceptive and they engaged in insider trading  24  This case was settled out of court in July 2008  both sides withdrawing their claims  25  There is an Australian company that had been issued a mineral prospecting license in the early 1970s which is still very active in doing research and collecting data on potential mineral deposits on Niue  citation needed  Remittances from Niuean expatriates were a major source of foreign exchange in the 1970s and early 1980s  The continuous migration of Niueans to New Zealand has shifted most members of nuclear and extended families to New Zealand  removing the need to send remittances back home  In the late 1990s  PFTAC conducted studies on the Niue balance of payments  26  which confirmed that Niueans are receiving little remittances but are sending more monies overseas  mainly for paying for imported goods and for the education of Niuean students sent to study in New Zealand  citation needed  Foreign aid  principally from New Zealand  has been the island s principal source of income  27  Although most Niuean foreign aid comes from New Zealand the island nation is currently losing  250 000 NZ a year  i e  reduce in New Zealand funding  meaning the country will come to rely upon its own economy more in times to come  Government expenses consistently exceed revenue to a substantial degree  with aid from New Zealand subsidizing public service payrolls  The government also generates some revenue  mainly from income tax  import tax and the lease of phone lines  The government briefly flirted with the creation of  offshore banking   but  under pressure from the US Treasury  agreed to end its support for schemes designed to minimize tax in countries like New Zealand  Niue now provides an automated Companies Registration  which is administered by the New Zealand Ministry of Economic Development  The Niue Legislative Assembly passed the Niue Consumption Tax Act in the first week of February 2009  and the 12 5  tax on good and services is expected to come into effect on 1 April 2009  Income tax has been lowered  and import tax may be reset to zero except for  sin  items like tobacco  alcohol and soft drinks  Tax on secondary income has been lowered from 35  to 10   with the stated goal of fostering increased labour productivity  28  In 1997  the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority  IANA   under contract with the US Department of Commerce  assigned the Internet Users Society Niue  IUS N   a private charity  as manager of the  nu top level domain on the Internet  IUS N s charitable purpose was   and continues to be   to use revenue from registering  nu domain names to fund low cost or free Internet services for the people of Niue  In a letter to ICANN in 2007  IUS N s independent auditors reported IUS N had invested US 3 million for Internet services in Niue between 1999 and 2005 from  nu domain name registration revenue during that period  In 1999  IUS N and the Government of Niue signed an agreement whereby the Government recognized that IUS N managed the  nu ccTLD under IANA s authority and IUS N committed to provide free Internet services to government departments as well as to Niue s private citizens  A newly elected Government later disputed that agreement and attempted to assert a claim on the domain name  including a requirement for IUS N to make direct payments of compensation to the Government  29  In 2005  a Government appointed Commission of Inquiry into the dispute released its report  which found no merit in the government s claims  the government subsequently dismissed the claims in 2007  30  Starting in 2003  IUS N began installing WiFi connections throughout the capital village of Alofi and in several nearby villages and schools  and has been expanding WiFi coverage into the outer villages since then  making Niue the first WiFi Nation  31  To assure security for Government departments  IUS N provides the government with a secure DSL connection to IUS N s satellite Internet link  at no cost  In 2003  the Government made a commitment to develop and expand vanilla production with the support of NZAID  Vanilla has grown wild in Niue for a long time  Despite the setback caused by the devastation of Cyclone Heta in early 2004  there was ongoing work on vanilla production  The expansion plan started with the employment of the unemployed or underemployed labour force to help clear land  plant supporting trees and plant vanilla vines  The approach to accessing land includes planning to have each household plant a small plot of around half to 1 acre  4 000 m2  to be cleared and planted with vanilla vines  There are a lot of planting materials for supporting trees to meet demand for the expansion of vanilla plantations  however there is a severe shortage of vanilla vines for planting stock  There is of course the existing vanilla vines  but cutting them for planting stock will reduce or stop the vanilla from producing beans  At the moment  the focus is in the areas of harvesting and marketing  citation needed  Niue s economy suffered from the devastating tropical Cyclone Heta on 4 January 2004  The Niue Integrated Strategic Plan  NISP  is the national development plan  setting national priorities for development  Cyclone Heta took away about two years from the implementation of the NISP  while national efforts concentrate on the recovery efforts  In 2008  Niue had yet to fully recover from the devastation of Cyclone Heta  In the area of trade  Niue is currently in the process of negotiating with other Pacific countries free trade agreements  PICTA Trade in Services  PICTA TIS   Economic Partnership Agreements with the European Union  and PACER Plus with Australia and New Zealand  The Office of the Chief Trade Adviser  OCTA  has already been set up to assist Niue and other Pacific countries in the negotiation of the PACER Plus  Niue uses the New Zealand dollar   edit  Agriculture Agriculture is very important to the lifestyle of Niueans and the economy  and around 204 square kilometres of Niue s total land area are available for agriculture  32 Subsistence agriculture is very much part of Niue s agriculture  where nearly all the households have plantations of taro  33  Taro is a staple food  and the pink taro now dominant in the taro markets in New Zealand and Australia  is an intellectual property of Niue  This is one of the natural taro varieties on Niue  and has a strong resistance to pests  Tapioca or cassava  yams and kumaras also grow very well  34  as do different varieties of bananas  Copra  passionfruit and limes dominated exports in the 1970s  but in 2008 vanilla  noni and taro are Niue s main export crops  Coconut crab is also part of the food chain  it lives in the forest and coastal areas  35  The last agricultural census was in 1989  36   edit  Tourism This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Tourism has been identified as one of the three priority economic sectors  the other two are fisheries and agriculture  for economic development in Niue  In 2006  estimated visitor expenditure reached  1 6 million making tourism a major export industry for Niue  Niue will continue to receive direct support from the Government and overseas donor agencies  Air New Zealand is the sole airline serving Niue  flying to Niue once a week  It took over after Polynesian Airlines stopped flying in November 2005  There is currently a tourism development strategy to increase the number of rooms available to overseas tourists at a sustainable level  Niue is also trying to attract foreign investors to invest in the tourism industry of Niue by offering import and company tax concessions as incentives   edit  Media Niue does not have much media  due to its small size and population  It has two broadcast media outlets  Television Niue and Radio Sunshine  managed and operated by the Broadcasting Corporation of Niue  and one printed newspaper  the Niue Star  37  The internet also provides opportunity for other news services like http   talanet okakoa com   edit  Information technology The first computers were Apple machines brought in by the University of the South Pacific Extension Centre around the early 1980s  The Treasury Department first computerised their general ledger in 1986 using NEC personal computers which are IBM PC XT compatible  citation needed  The Census of Households and Population in 1986 was the first to be processed using a personal computer with the assistance of David Marshall  FAO Adviser on Agricultural Statistics  advising UNFPA Demographer Dr Lawrence Lewis and Niue Government Statistician Bill Vakaafi Motufoou to switch from using manual tabulation cards  In 1987 Statistics Niue got its new personal computer NEC PC AT use for processing the 1986 census data  Niue s personnel were sent on training in Japan and New Zealand to use the new computer  Niue s first Computer Policy was developed and adopted in 1988  citation needed  Students using their OLPC laptops on the school yard In 2003  Niue became the first territory to offer free wireless internet to all its inhabitants  38  In August 2008 it has been reported that 100 percent of primary and high school students have what is known as the OLPC XO 1  a specialised laptop by the One Laptop per Child project designed for children in the developing world  39  Niue was also a location of tests for the OpenBTS project  which aims to deliver low cost GSM base stations built with open source software  40  In July 2011  Niue Telecom launched pre paid mobile services  Voice EDGE   2 5G  as Rokcell Mobile based on the commercial GSM product of vendor Lemko  Three BTS sites will cover the
