Publication history Marvel Comics  then publisher Stan Lee  said in 1978  shortly after Spider Woman s debut in Marvel Spotlight  32  Feb  1977  and the start of the character s 50 issue  self titled series  cover dated April 1978   June 1983   that the character originated because  I suddenly realized that some other company may quickly put out a book like that and claim they have the right to use the name  and I thought we d better do it real fast to copyright the name  So we just batted one quickly  and that s exactly what happened  I wanted to protect the name  because it s the type of thing  where  someone else might say   Hey  why don t we put out a Spider Woman  they can t stop us       You know  years ago we brought out Wonder Man  and  DC Comics  sued us because they had Wonder Woman  and     I said okay  I ll discontinue Wonder Man  And all of a sudden they ve got Power Girl  after Marvel had introduced Power Man   Oh  boy  How unfair  2  On December 21  2005  Marvel released the first issue of Spider Woman  Origin  a five part miniseries co written by Brian Michael Bendis and Brian Reed  illustrated by the art team of the Luna Brothers  Jonathan and Joshua Luna  Spider Woman s 1970s adventures were collected in an Essentials trade paperback released December 21  2005   edit  Fictional character biography  edit  Origins Jessica Miriam Drew  daughter of Jonathan and Merriam Drew  was born in London  England  At a young age  Jessica was lethally poisoned by radiation while living near Mount Wundagore in Transia  In an attempt to save her life  her father injected her with an experimental serum based on irradiated spiders  blood  Because the serum did not have any apparent effect on her  the man who would come to be known as the High Evolutionary  Herbert Wyndham  placed her in a genetic accelerator  While in the accelerator  she aged at a decelerated rate  When she was finally released  decades later  Drew was only seventeen years old  Jessica grew up on Mount Wundagore under the care of Lady Bova  one of the High Evolutionary s New Men  She was cared for and received the equivalent of a high school education  She eventually left when she did not appear to fit in  Her first few years were confusing as she adjusted to life among other humans  3  Eventually  HYDRA  under the control of Count Otto Vermis  found and recruited her as a HYDRA agent  Through brainwashing and manipulation  she was convinced she was not human but actually an evolved spider  During this time  she went by the alias of Arachne  As a HYDRA agent  she battled Nick Fury and S H I E L D   until Jessica learned HYDRA s true nature  She quit HYDRA and turned on them  and was responsible for the fatal crash of HYDRA head Otto Vermis  4   edit  Spider Woman  Origin Origin does away with the spider blood serum and genetic accelerator elements of the character s previous origin story  volume  amp  issue needed  Instead  Jessica s powers derive from her mother s womb being hit by a laser beam containing the DNA traits of several different species of spiders while she was carrying Jessica  the Drews were trying to splice and harness spiders  environmental adaptive capabilities  in order to graft them into the human genome   After Jessica s parents disappeared under mysterious circumstances  Jessica was recruited into HYDRA  under false pretenses   where she was made into a formidable fighter assassin  She was trained and mentored by Taskmaster  who schooled her in many martial disciplines and more than seven different fighting styles out of his own  arsenal   In this re telling  Otto Vermis  who had originally recruited her into HYDRA  is rather an old  retired HYDRA agent who Jessica seduces in order to gain information that will lead her to her mother  In addition  Origin made the following modifications  Merriem Drew was now Miriam Drew  The Drews moved to Wundagore Mountain prior to Jessica s conception  establishing without a doubt that she was born on the European landmark  Afterwards  she was raised by her nanny Bova  who was human in appearance   as well as her mother  Jessica s father  Jonathan  never found uranium on their land  Instead  their research was funded by HYDRA  and their direct liaison financier from the group was General Wyndham  It is not clear what connection  if any  he had with Edgar Wyndham  who in the original Spider Woman books was Jonathan s best friend and research partner   nor with the High Evolutionary  Jessica s father was never possessed by the spirit of the Sixth Century magician Magnus  no reason exists for Magnus  decades later  to help Jessica in many of her adventures  Jessica s father worked in large part with Miles Warren  who later left the project because he felt that there was more potential in experimenting with the cloning of human cells   edit  Spider Woman Now going by the name Spider Woman  Jessica used her new identity to track down her father s killer  starting her search in London  During this time  Jessica was recaptured by HYDRA and brainwashed into working for them again  This brought her into direct conflict with Ben Grimm  5  After HYDRA s brainwashing was reversed  she battled magical elements alongside the Thing and Modred the Mystic  6  Jessica battled Excaliber  agent of Morgan Le Fay  and then came into contact with Morgan s arch nemesis  the sorcerer Magnus  7  Magnus would become one of her strongest allies  and provided information that would lead Jessica to relocate with him to Los Angeles where she began her career as a costumed crime fighter  8  She encountered Morgan Le Fey s ghost  9  Jessica also tracked down her father s murderers  10  Jessica was pursued at this time by S H I E L D  agent Jerry Hunt  who followed her to Los Angeles to begin a romantic relationship with her  In her early days as Spider Woman  Jessica chose to keep her presence in Los Angeles a secret  She met super powered foes such as the Brothers Grimm  Hangman  the Enforcer  the Needle  Hammer and Anvil  11 Nekra  the Silver Samurai  Viper  Gypsy Moth  and the Waxman  as well as allies such as Werewolf by Night and the Shroud  Jessica also sought to discover the true nature of her pheromones  which appeared to produce a strong sexual attraction from men and repulsion from women  Her search led her to the Hatros Institute and her first true job  Working as a secretary  she was able to gain free medical treatment to suppress her pheromones so that she could move effectively among people without producing any unwanted side effects  Alongside the Shroud  she battled the above mentioned Nekra and the cult of Kali  and learned of her pheromone secretions  The culmination of her time at the Hatros Institute led Jessica to her encounter with Nekra  and the loss of her job  12  Unemployed  Jessica briefly considered stealing  but at the last moment decided against it  She came into contact with Spider Man  who advised her to use her unique talents to help others in need  13  Jessica chose to heed his advice and become a bounty hunter  She worked closely with former FBI specialist  Scotty McDowell  14  who later became the Hornet  When their working relationship failed  Jessica moved with her best friend Lindsay McCabe to San Francisco where she set up a practice as a licensed private investigator  On her first assignment  she battled Siryn  Black Tom Cassidy  and the Juggernaut alongside the X Men  15  She also battled Morgan Le Fey once again  16  While working as a P I   Jessica encountered the Viper and the Silver Samurai in a battle  Two main revelations came out of it  The first was that Lindsay McCabe finally learned that Spider Woman and Jessica were one and the same  although Lindsay claimed that she had known all along   The other was Viper s claim to be Jessica s real mother  of which she tried to convince Jessica  Whether this meant she was actually Miriem Drew remains unknown  but the resemblance between the two was uncanny and even fooled other HYDRA agents  The Viper was shown to be a pawn of Chthon however  and ultimately betrayed Chthon rather than hurt Jessica  17  Jessica later encountered and battle the Viper again  although now the Viper believed Jessica had brainwashed her into believing that she was her mother  18  Not long after that  Jessica gave up her immunity powers to save Giant Man  19  Jessica traveled in astral form with Magnus to Sixth Century England to free her friends  souls in a showdown with Morgan le Fey in the 6th century  She managed to vanquish Morgan  but Jessica s human body died while her spirit was gone from it  20  Jessica was believed dead and the sorcerer  Magnus  placed a spell over humanity to remove all traces of Jessica s existence  However  this spell was faulty  and Tigra and the Shroud discovered Jessica s dead body and contacted the Avengers and Doctor Strange  It turned out that Jessica was in fact trapped on the astral plane  and was attempting to make contact with her body again  The Avengers and Strange traveled to the astral plane to battle Morgan Le Fay  who was also trapped on the astral plane  Morgan attempted to foil the Avengers  attempts to revive Jessica  bringing Morgan in direct conflict with both the Avengers and Dr  Strange  Eventually  Doctor Strange was able to reunite Jessica spirit with her human body and trap Morgan  but it was not without a cost  Jessica s bioelectric powers were eliminated and Magnus sacrificed his astral form to help restore her to life  Jessica was nevertheless grateful for returning to the land of the living  and abandoned her Spider Woman identity  21  She continued her life simply as a private investigator in San Francisco  assisted by Lindsay McCabe and occasionally by Tigra  The Shroud and during their brief time in the city  the X Men  Jessica Drew frequented Madripoor as a private investigator  partnered with Lindsay McCabe  During this time she had lost her ability to discharge bioelectricity  but found that her super powers were slowly returning  She still possessed superhuman strength and agility  and the ability to cling to walls  At one point  she became ensorcelled by the Black Blade  and battled Wolverine  22  However  she became an ally and confidante of Patch  an alter ego of Wolverine   and developed a friendship with pilot Archie Corrigan  who helped her return to San Francisco  where Jessica worked to sort out her life  Jessica Drew s life settled down until Charlotte Witter  a villainess going by the name of Spider Woman  stole her powers  After the theft  Jessica returned to her life as a private investigator and served as a teacher and mentor to Mattie Franklin  a young woman who had assumed the Spider Woman identity  Jessica began to regain her powers at this time  while investigating two cases with Mattie  she made use of her restored superhuman strength and agility  Although she regained the bulk of her spider powers  they were unstable  For example  her  venom blasts  worked efficiently in one fight  and then would fail her unexpectedly on another occasion  When Mattie Franklin was drawn into a highly abusive and parasitic relationship with a New York based drug dealer who cannibalized her tissue to make the Mutant Growth Hormone  commonly known as  MGH    Jessica did not hesitate to investigate  despite the instability of her powers   An initial misunderstanding with local P I  Jessica Jones who shared many surprising similarities to Drew turned into an alliance when the women teamed up to rescue Mattie from her captors   edit  Civil War During Civil War Jessica was the subject of an entire issue of The New Avengers  In it she is arrested and interrogated by S H I E L D  director Hill and Iron Man who still question her loyalties  using one of the robotic copies of Nick Fury to try to trick her into giving herself away  The interrogation is interrupted  however  by agents of HYDRA who make a daring raid on the S H I E L D  Helicarrier using an EMP weapon  temporarily paralyzing Iron Man and almost crashing the Helicarrier into Rhode Island  When she comes to on Hydra Island she is offered the position of  Madame Hydra   the head of the organization  which she declines and proceeds to burn HYDRA s facilities down as she leaves the island to meet up with and join Captain America and his Secret Avengers  23   edit  Secret Invasion One day  a HYDRA agent known as Connely attacked her and offered her powers back if she would rejoin S H I E L D  as a double agent  Knowing Connely would kill her if she said no  Jessica agreed and contacted Nick Fury  who confronted her securely and urged her to accept the offer  He told Jessica that he would feed her limited info until S H I E L D  could analyze the HYDRA cell and then use the info to take it down  volume  amp  issue needed  Jessica s double agent status is a cause for a great deal of mistrust between herself and other characters  After Nick Fury is ousted as head of S H I E L D   Jessica is confronted by the new director  Maria Hill  about her loyalties  Jessica remains loyal to Fury rather than the leadership in S H I E L D  Jessica also has conflicts with her teammates in the Avengers because of her divided loyalties  volume  amp  issue needed  It is later revealed  however  that the Jessica who had joined the Avengers and was acting as a double agent under the command of Nick Fury was not Jessica Drew at all  but instead a Skrull imposter  When she went undercover to regain her lost powers  she was ambushed by the Skrulls and replaced by their current Queen Veranke  who took her place in the New Avengers and assumed her role as Fury s spy  in preparation for the upcoming Invasion  volume  amp  issue needed   There are quite a few people on my message boards and the CBR ones who are gigantic Spider Woman fans and they ve loved me for bringing her back  With her being in a number one book  she s had a wave of good fortune that she hasn t seen since her heyday  And the whole time I was writing her I d think those fans are going to fucking lose their shit because we ve had this planned since New Avengers  1  You can go back to issue  1 and see hints  There s not a segment of the readership that I haven t felt worse about doing this to than the Spider Woman fans  I want to express publicly that your love of the character will not be lost  Now you know why the Spider Woman series didn t happen  We thought about doing it and having her revealed as a Skrull in the first issue of her series  Last year  we were going to do the series and at the end of the issue she d do something wrong  go off somewhere private and revert to Skrull form  It would be like   Woah  The lead character of the book isn t who she thought she was   I wrote it  but in the end I just thought it wasn t selling somebody what they thought you were selling them  But if you did it as part of a team book it s much less bullshitty  You expect things to happen in a team book but if you re buying Spider Woman  you want Spider Woman    Brian Michael Bendis 24  In the conclusion to Secret Invasion  Jessica is revealed to be alive when Iron Man finds a Skrull ship in orbit with all the replaced heroes  Carol Danvers runs up to her and gives her a hug  Unaware of Queen Veranke s actions  Jessica asks why the other heroes have been giving her strange looks  to which Carol responds that  No one
