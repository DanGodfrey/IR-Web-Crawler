Television From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search For other uses  see Television  disambiguation    TV  redirects here  For other uses  see TV  disambiguation   American family watching TV  1958 Television  TV  is a telecommunication medium for transmitting and receiving moving images that can be monochrome  black and white  or colored  with or without accompanying sound   Television  may also refer specifically to a television set  television programming  or television transmission  The etymology of the word has a mixed Latin and Greek origin  meaning  far sight   Greek tele         far  and Latin visio  sight  from video  vis  to see  or to view in the first person   Commercially available since the late 1920s  the television set has become commonplace in homes  businesses and institutions  particularly as a vehicle for advertising  a source of entertainment  and news  Since the 1970s the availability of video cassettes  laserdiscs  DVDs and now Blu ray Discs  have resulted in the television set frequently being used for viewing recorded as well as broadcast material  In recent years Internet television has seen the rise of television available via the Internet  e g  iPlayer and Hulu  Although other forms such as closed circuit television  CCTV  are in use  the most common usage of the medium is for broadcast television  which was modeled on the existing radio broadcasting systems developed in the 1920s  and uses high powered radio frequency transmitters to broadcast the television signal to individual TV receivers  The broadcast television system is typically disseminated via radio transmissions on designated channels in the 54 890 MHz frequency band  1  Signals are now often transmitted with stereo or surround sound in many countries  Until the 2000s broadcast TV programs were generally transmitted as an analog television signal  but in 2008 the USA went almost exclusively digital  A standard television set comprises multiple internal electronic circuits  including those for receiving and decoding broadcast signals  A visual display device which lacks a tuner is properly called a video monitor  rather than a television  A television system may use different technical standards such as digital television  DTV  and high definition television  HDTV   Television systems are also used for surveillance  industrial process control  and guiding of weapons  in places where direct observation is difficult or dangerous  By 2012 the development of broadband enabled the integration of the internet and Web 2 0 features into modern television sets and set top boxes  as well as the technological convergence between computers and television  Such TVs are called smart TV s or  connected TV   which is the biggest current innovation in consumer electronics  Contents 1 History 2 Geographical usage 3 Content 3 1 Programming 3 2 Funding 3 2 1 Advertising 3 2 1 1 United States 3 2 1 2 United Kingdom 3 2 1 3

External links History Main article  History of television In its early stages of development  television employed a combination of optical  mechanical and electronic technologies to capture  transmit and display a visual image  By the late 1920s  however  those employing only optical and electronic technologies were being explored  All modern television systems relied on the latter  although the knowledge gained from the work on electromechanical systems was crucial in the development of fully electronic television  Braun HF 1 television receiver  Germany  1958 The first images transmitted electrically were sent by early mechanical fax machines  including the pantelegraph  developed in the late nineteenth century  The concept of electrically powered transmission of television images in motion was first sketched in 1878 as the telephonoscope  shortly after the invention of the telephone  At the time  it was imagined by early science fiction authors  that someday that light could be transmitted over copper wires  as sounds were  The idea of using scanning to transmit images was put to actual practical use in 1881 in the pantelegraph  through the use of a pendulum based scanning mechanism  From this period forward  scanning in one form or another has been used in nearly every image transmission technology to date  including television  This is the concept of  rasterization   the process of converting a visual image into a stream of electrical pulses  In 1884 Paul Gottlieb Nipkow  a 23 year old university student in Germany  patented the first electromechanical television system which employed a scanning disk  a spinning disk with a series of holes spiraling toward the center  for rasterization  The holes were spaced at equal angular intervals such that in a single rotation the disk would allow light to pass through each hole and onto a light sensitive selenium sensor which produced the electrical pulses  As an image was focused on the rotating disk  each hole captured a horizontal  slice  of the whole image  citation needed  Nipkow s design would not be practical until advances in amplifier tube technology became available  The device was only useful for transmitting still  halftone  images represented by equally spaced dots of varying size over telegraph or telephone lines  citation needed  Later designs would use a rotating mirror drum scanner to capture the image and a cathode ray tube  CRT  as a display device  but moving images were still not possible  due to the poor sensitivity of the selenium sensors  In 1907 Russian scientist Boris Rosing became the first inventor to use a CRT in the receiver of an experimental television system  He used mirror drum scanning to transmit simple geometric shapes to the CRT  2  Vladimir Zworykin demonstrates electronic television  1929   Using a Nipkow disk  Scottish inventor John Logie Baird succeeded in demonstrating the transmission of moving silhouette images in London in 1925  3  and of moving  monochromatic images in 1926  Baird s scanning disk produced an image of 30 lines resolution  just enough to discern a human face  from a double spiral of lenses  4  This demonstration by Baird is generally agreed to be the world s first true demonstration of television  albeit a mechanical form of television no longer in use  Remarkably  in 1927 Baird also invented the world s first video recording system   Phonovision   by modulating the output signal of his TV camera down to the audio range  he was able to capture the signal on a 10 inch wax audio disc using conventional audio recording technology  A handful of Baird s  Phonovision  recordings survive and these were finally decoded and rendered into viewable images in the 1990s using modern digital signal processing technology  5  In 1926  Hungarian engineer K lm n Tihanyi designed a television system utilizing fully electronic scanning and display elements  and employing the principle of  charge storage  within the scanning  or  camera   tube  6  7  8  9  By 1927  Russian inventor L on Theremin developed a mirror drum based television system which used interlacing to achieve an image resolution of 100 lines  10  Also in 1927  Herbert E  Ives of Bell Labs transmitted moving images from a 50 aperture disk producing 16 frames per minute over a cable from Washington  DC to New York City  and via radio from Whippany  New Jersey  citation needed  Ives used viewing screens as large as 24 by 30 inches  60 by 75 cm   His subjects included Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover  citation needed  Philo Farnsworth In 1927  Philo Farnsworth made the world s first working television system with electronic scanning of both the pickup and display devices  11  which he first demonstrated to the press on 1 September 1928  11  12  WRGB claims to be the world s oldest television station  tracing its roots to an experimental station founded on January 13  1928  broadcasting from the General Electric factory in Schenectady  NY  under the call letters W2XB  13  It was popularly known as  WGY Television  after its sister radio station  Later in 1928  General Electric started a second facility  this one in New York City  which had the call letters W2XBS  and which today is known as WNBC  The two stations were experimental in nature and had no regular programming  as receivers were operated by engineers within the company  The image of a Felix the Cat doll  rotating on a turntable  was broadcast for 2 hours every day for several years  as new technology was being tested by the engineers  In 1936 the Olympic Games in Berlin were carried by cable to television stations in Berlin and Leipzig where the public could view the games live  14  In 1935 the German firm of Fernseh A G  and the United States firm Farnsworth Television owned by Philo Farnsworth signed an agreement to exchange their television patents and technology to speed development of television transmitters and stations in their respective countries  15  On 2 November 1936 the BBC began transmitting the world s first public regular high definition service from the Victorian Alexandra Palace in north London  16  It therefore claims to be the birthplace of television broadcasting as we know it today  In 1936  K lm n Tihanyi described the principle of plasma display  the first flat panel display system  17  18  Mexican inventor Guillermo Gonz lez Camarena also played an important role in early television  His experiments with television  known as telectroescop a at first  began in 1931 and led to a patent for the  trichromatic field sequential system  color television in 1940  19  as well as the remote control  citation needed  Although television became more familiar in the United States with the general public at the 1939 World s Fair  the outbreak of World War II prevented it from being manufactured on a large scale until after the end of the war  True regular commercial television network programming did not begin in the U S  until 1948  During that year  legendary conductor Arturo Toscanini made his first of ten TV appearances conducting the NBC Symphony Orchestra  and Texaco Star Theater  starring comedian Milton Berle  became television s first gigantic hit show  citation needed  Amateur television  ham TV or ATV  was developed for non commercial experimentation  pleasure and public service events by amateur radio operators  Ham TV stations were on the air in many cities before commercial TV stations came on the air  20  Geographical usage Television introduction by

of television in countries Content Programming See also  Television program and Category Television genres Getting TV programming shown to the public can happen in many different ways  After production the next step is to market and deliver the product to whatever markets are open to using it  This typically happens on two levels  Original Run or First Run  a producer creates a program of one or multiple episodes and shows it on a station or network which has either paid for the production itself or to which a license has been granted by the television producers to do the same  Broadcast syndication  this is the terminology rather broadly used to describe secondary programming usages  beyond original run   It includes secondary runs in the country of first issue  but also international usage which may not be managed by the originating producer  In many cases other companies  TV stations or individuals are engaged to do the syndication work  in other words to sell the product into the markets they are allowed to sell into by contract from the copyright holders  in most cases the producers  First run programming is increasing on subscription services outside the U S   but few domestically produced programs are syndicated on domestic free to air  FTA  elsewhere  This practice is increasing however  generally on digital only FTA channels  or with subscriber only first run material appearing on FTA  Unlike the U S   repeat FTA screenings of a FTA network program almost only occur on that network  Also  affiliates rarely buy or produce non network programming that is not centred around local programming  Funding The examples and perspective in this section may not represent a worldwide view of the subject  Please improve this article and discuss the issue

financed by either government  advertising  licensing  a form of tax   subscription or any combination of these  To protect revenues  subscription TV channels are usually encrypted to ensure that only subscription payers receive the decryption codes to see the signal  Unencrypted channels are known as free to air or FTA  In 2009 the global TV market represented 1 217 2 million TV households with at least one television  and total revenues of 268 9 billion EUR  declining 1 2  compared to 2008   21  North America had the biggest TV revenue market share with 39   followed by Europe  31    Asia Pacific  21    Latin America  8   and Africa and the Middle East  2    22  Globally  the different TV revenue sources divide into 45 to 50  TV advertising revenues  40 to 45  subscription fees and 10  public funding  23  24  Advertising Television s broad reach makes it a powerful and attractive medium for advertisers  Many television networks and stations sell blocks of broadcast time to advertisers   sponsors   in order to fund their programming  25  United States Since inception in the U S  in 1940 citation needed   television commercials have become one of the most effective  persuasive  and popular methods of selling products of many sorts  especially consumer goods  During the 1940s and into the 1950s  programs were hosted by single advertisers  This  in turn  gave great creative license to the advertisers over the content of the show  Due to citation needed  the quiz show scandals in the 1950s  networks shifted to the magazine concept introducing advertising breaks with multiple advertisers  U S  advertising rates are determined primarily by Nielsen ratings  The time of the day and popularity of the channel determine how much a television commercial can cost  For example  the highly popular American Idol can cost approximately  750 000 for a 30 second block of commercial time  while the same amount of time for the World Cup and the Super Bowl can cost several million dollars  Conversely  lesser viewed time slots  such as early mornings and weekday afternoons  are often sold in bulk to producers of infomercials which is less expensive  In recent years  the paid program or infomercial has become common  usually in lengths of 30 minutes or one hour  Some drug companies and other businesses have even created  news  items for broadcast  known in the industry as video news releases  paying program directors to use them  26  Some TV programs also weave advertisements into their shows  a practice begun in film and known as product placement  For example  a character could be drinking a certain kind of soda  going to a particular chain restaurant  or driving a certain make of car   This is sometimes very subtle  where shows have vehicles provided by manufacturers for low cost  rather than wrangling them   Sometimes a specific brand or trade mark  or music from a certain artist or group  is used   This excludes guest appearances by artists  who perform on the show   United Kingdom The TV regulator oversees TV advertising in the United Kingdom  Its restrictions have applied since the early days of commercially funded TV  Despite this  an early TV mogul  Roy Thomson  likened the broadcasting licence as being a  licence to print money   27  Restrictions mean that the big three national commercial TV channels  ITV  Channel 4  and Five can show an average of only seven minutes of advertising per hour  eight minutes in the peak period   Other broadcasters must average no more than nine minutes  twelve in the peak   This means that many imported TV shows from the US have unnatural breaks where the UK company has edited out the breaks intended for US advertising  Advertisements must not be inserted in the course of certain specific proscribed types of programs which last less than half an hour in scheduled duration  this list includes any news or current affairs program  documentaries  and programs for children  Nor may advertisements be carried in a program designed and broadcast for reception in schools or in any religious broadcasting service or other devotional program  or during a formal Royal ceremony or occasion  There also must be clear demarcations in time between the programs and the advertisements  The BBC  being strictly non commercial is not allowed to show advertisements on television in the UK  although it has many advertising funded channels abroad  The majority of its budget comes from television license fees  see below  and broadcast syndication  the sale of content to other broadcasters  Ireland The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland  BCI   Irish  Coimisi n Craolach in na h ireann  28  oversees advertising on television and radio within Ireland on both private and state owned broadcasters  Similar to other European countries  advertising is found on both private and state owned broadcasters  There are some restrictions based on advertising  especially in relation to the advertising of alcohol  Such advertisements are prohibited until after 7pm  Broadcasters in Ireland adhere to broadcasting legislation implemented by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and the European Union  Sponsorship of current affairs programming is prohibited at all times  As of October 1  2009 the responsibilities held by the BCI are gradually being transferred to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland  Taxation or license Television services in some countries may be funded by a television licence or a form of taxation which means advertising plays a lesser role or no role at all  For example  some channels may carry no advertising at all and some very little  including  Australia  ABC  Japan  NHK  Norway  NRK  Sweden  SVT  United Kingdom  BBC  United States  PBS  The BBC carries no television advertising on its UK channels and is funded by an annual television license paid by all households owning a television  This television license fee is set by government  but the BBC is not answerable to or controlled by government  The two main BBC TV channels are watched by almost 90 percent of the population each week and overall have 27 per cent share of total viewing  29  This in spite of the fact that 85  of homes are multichannel  with 42  of these having access to 200 free to air channels via satellite and another 43  having access to 30 or more channels via Freeview  30  The licence that funds the seven advertising free BBC TV channels currently costs  139 50 a year  about US 215  irrespective of the number of TV sets owned  When the same sporting event has been presented on both BBC and commercial channels  the BBC always attracts the lion s share of the audience  indicating viewers prefer to watch TV uninterrupted by advertising  The Australian Broadcasting Corporation  ABC  carries no advertising  except for internal promotional material  as it is banned under the ABC Act 1983  The ABC receives its funding from the Australian Government every three years  In the 2008 09 Federal Budget the ABC received A 1 13 Billion  31  The funds assist in providing the ABC s Television  Radio  Online and International outputs  The ABC also receives funds from its many ABC Shops across Australia  However funded by the Australian Government the editorial independence of the ABC is ensured through law  In France and Ireland government funded channels carry advertisements yet those who own television sets have to pay an annual tax   la redevance audiovisuelle    32  In Japan  NHK is paid for by license fees  known in Japanese as reception fee       Jushinry      The Broadcast Law which governs NHK s funding stipulates that any television equipped to receive NHK is required to pay  The fee is standardized  with discounts for office workers and students who commute  as well a general discount for residents of Okinawa prefecture  Subscription Some TV channels are partly funded from subscriptions therefore the signals are encrypted during broadcast to ensure that only the paying subscribers have access to the decryption codes to watch pay television or specialty channels  Most subscription services are also funded by advertising  Genres Television genres include a broad range of programming types that entertain  inform  and educate viewers  The most expensive entertainment genres to produce are usually drama and dramatic miniseries  However  other genres  such as historical Western genres  may also have high production costs  Popular culture entertainment genres include action oriented shows such as police  crime  detective dramas  horror  or thriller shows  As well  there are also other variants of the drama genre  such as medical dramas and daytime soap operas  Science fiction shows can fall into either the drama or action category  depending on whether they emphasize philosophical questions or high adventure  Comedy is a popular genre which includes situation comedy  sitcom  and animated shows for the adult demographic such as South Park  The least expensive forms of entertainment programming genres are game shows  talk shows  variety shows  and Reality television  Game shows show contestants answering questions and solving puzzles to win prizes  Talk shows feature interviews with film  television and music celebrities and public figures  Variety shows feature a range of musical performers and other entertainers such as comedians and magicians introduced by a host or Master of Ceremonies  There is some crossover between some talk shows and variety shows  because leading talk shows often feature performances by bands  singers  comedians  and other performers in between the interview segments  Reality TV shows  regular  people  i e   not actors  who are facing unusual challenges or experiences  ranging from arrest by police officers  COPS  to weight loss  The Biggest Loser   A variant version of reality shows depicts celebrities doing mundane activities such as going about their everyday life  The Osbournes  Snoop Dogg s Father Hood  or doing manual labor  The Simple Life   Sales of televisions North American consumers purchase a new television every seven years  and the average household owns 2 8 televisions  As of 2011 update   48 million are sold each year  at an average price of  460 and size of 38 inches  33  Televisions for consumer purchase Worldwide large

pivotal role in the socialization of the 20th and 21st centuries  There are many aspects of television that can be addressed  including media violence research  In 2010 the iPlayer incorporated a social media aspect to its internet television service  including Facebook and Twitter  35  Environmental aspects With high lead content in CRTs  and the rapid diffusion of new  flat panel display technologies  some of which  LCDs  use lamps which contain mercury  there is growing concern about electronic waste from discarded televisions  Related occupational health concerns exist  as well  for disassemblers removing copper wiring and other materials from CRTs  Further environmental concerns related to television design and use relate to the devices  increasing electrical energy requirements
