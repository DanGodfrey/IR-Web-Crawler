Rep blica Portuguesa  is a country situated in southwestern Europe on the Iberian Peninsula  Portugal is the westernmost country of Europe  and is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the West and South and by Spain to the North and East  The Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira are part of Portugal  The country is named after its second largest city  Porto  whose Latin name was Portus Cale  8  The land within the borders of today s Portuguese Republic has been continuously settled since prehistoric times  occupied by Celts like the Gallaeci and the Lusitanians  integrated into the Roman Republic and later settled by Germanic peoples such as the Suebi  Swabians  Vandals and the Visigoths  In the 8th century most of the Iberian Peninsula was conquered by Moorish invaders professing Islam  which were later expelled by the Knights Templar under the Order of Christ  During the Christian Reconquista  Portugal established itself as an independent kingdom from Le n in 1139  claiming to be the oldest European nation state  9  In the 15th and 16th centuries  as the result of pioneering the Age of Discovery  Portugal expanded western influence and established a global empire that included possessions in Africa  Asia  Oceania  and South America  becoming the world s major economic  political and military global power  The Portuguese Empire was the first global empire in history  10  and also the longest lived of the European colonial empires  spanning almost 600 years  from the capture of Ceuta in 1415  to the handover of Macau to China in 1999  However  the country s international status was greatly reduced during the 19th century  especially following the independence of Brazil  its largest colony  After the 1910 revolution deposed the monarchy  the democratic but unstable Portuguese First Republic was established being then superseded by the  Estado Novo  authoritarian regime  Democracy was restored after the Portuguese Colonial War and the Carnation Revolution in 1974  after which Portugal s last overseas provinces became independent  most prominently Angola and Mozambique   the last overseas territory  Macau  was ceded to China in 1999  Portugal is a developed country with a very high Human Development Index  the world s 19th highest quality of life  and a strong healthcare system  Portugal is one of the world s most globalized and

During the Reconquista period  Christians reconquered the Iberian Peninsula from the Muslim and Moorish domination  In 868  the First County of Portugal was formed  A victory over the Muslims at Battle of Ourique in 1139 is traditionally taken as the occasion when the County of Portugal as a fief of the Kingdom of Le n was transformed into the independent Kingdom of Portugal  Henry  to whom the newly formed county was awarded by Alfonso VI for his role in reconquering land from the Moors  based his newly formed county in Bracara Augusta  nowadays Braga   capital city of the ancient Roman province  and also previous capital of several kingdoms over the first millennia  On 24 June 1128  the Battle of S o Mamede occurred near Guimar es  Afonso Henriques  Count of Portugal  defeated his mother Countess Teresa and her lover Fern o Peres de Trava  thereby establishing himself as sole leader  Afonso Henriques officially declared Portugal s independence when he proclaimed himself king of Portugal on 25 July 1139  after the Battle of Ourique  He was recognized as such in 1143 by Alfonso VII  king of Le n and Castile  and in 1179 by Pope Alexander III  The Batalha Monastery  built in 1385  is one of the best and original examples of Late Gothic architecture in Portugal  It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site  Afonso Henriques and his successors  aided by military monastic orders  pushed southward to drive out the Moors  as the size of Portugal covered about half of its present area  In 1249  this Reconquista ended with the capture of the Algarve on the southern coast  giving Portugal its present day borders  with minor exceptions  In 1348 and 1349  like the rest of Europe  Portugal was devastated by the Black Death  13  In 1373  Portugal made an alliance with England  which is the longest standing alliance in the world  In 1383  the king of Castile  husband of the daughter of the Portuguese king who had died without a male heir  claimed his throne  An ensuing popular revolt led to the 1383 1385 Crisis  A faction of petty noblemen and commoners  led by John of Aviz  later John I   seconded by General Nuno  lvares Pereira defeated the Castilians in the Battle of Aljubarrota  This celebrated battle is still a symbol of glory and the struggle for independence from neighboring Spain   edit  Exploration  colonization and trade Main article  History of

spearheaded the exploration of the world and undertook the Age of Discovery  Infante Dom Henry the Navigator  son of King Jo o I  became the main sponsor and patron of this endeavor  In 1415  Portugal acquired the first of its overseas colonies by conquering Ceuta  It was the first prosperous Islamic trade center in North Africa  There followed the first discoveries in the Atlantic  Madeira and the Azores  which led to the first colonization movements  Throughout the 15th century  Portuguese explorers sailed the coast of Africa  establishing trading posts for several common types of tradable commodities at the time  ranging from gold to slaves  as they looked for a route to India and its spices  which were coveted in Europe  The Treaty of Tordesillas  intended to resolve the dispute that had been created following the return of Christopher Columbus  was signed on 7 June 1494  and divided the newly discovered lands outside Europe between Portugal and Spain along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands  off the west coast of Africa   In 1498  Vasco da Gama finally reached India and brought economic prosperity to Portugal and its population of 1 7 million residents  In 1500  Pedro  lvares Cabral discovered Brazil and claimed it for Portugal  14  Ten years later  Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Goa in India  Ormuz in the Persian Strait  and Malacca  now a state in Malaysia  Thus  the Portuguese empire held dominion over commerce in the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic  The Portuguese sailors set out to reach Eastern Asia by sailing eastward from Europe landing in such places as Taiwan  Japan  the island of Timor  they were also the first Europeans to discover Australia and even New Zealand  15  The Treaty of Zaragoza  signed on 22 April 1529 between Portugal and Spain  specified the antimeridian to the line of demarcation specified in the Treaty of Tordesillas  All these facts made Portugal the world s major economic  military  and political

cer Quibir in Morocco  and his great uncle and successor  King Henry of Portugal   both died without heirs  resulting in the extinction of that royal house  Subsequently  Philip II of Spain claimed the throne and so became Philip I of Portugal  Although Portugal did not lose its formal independence  it was governed by the same monarch who governed Spain  briefly forming a union of kingdoms  as a personal union  The joining of the two crowns deprived Portugal of a separate foreign policy  and led to the involvement in the Eighty Years  War being fought in Europe at the time between Spain and the Netherlands  War led to a deterioration of the relations with Portugal s oldest ally  England  and the loss of Hormuz  From 1595 to 1663 the Dutch Portuguese War primarily involved the Dutch companies invading many Portuguese colonies and commercial interests in Brazil  Africa  India and the Far East  resulting in the loss of the Portuguese Indian Sea trade monopoly  In 1640  John IV spearheaded an uprising backed by disgruntled nobles and was proclaimed king  The Portuguese Restoration War between Portugal and Spain on the aftermath of the 1640 revolt  ended the sixty year period of the Iberian Union under the House of Habsburg  This was the beginning of the House of Braganza  which reigned in Portugal until 1910  Official estimates   and most estimates made so far   place the number of Portuguese migrants to Colonial Brazil during the gold rush of the 18th century at 600 000  16  Though not usually studied  this represented one of the largest movements of European populations to their colonies to the Americas during the colonial times  According to historian Leslie Bethell   In 1700 Portugal had a population of about two million people   During the 18th century  hundreds of thousands left for the Portuguese Colony of Brazil  despite efforts by the crown to place severe restrictions on emigration  17   edit  Pombaline era Main articles  History of Portugal

Lisbon squire  began a diplomatic career as the Portuguese Ambassador in London and later in Vienna  The Queen consort of Portugal  Archduchess Maria Anne Josefa of Austria  was fond of Melo  and after his first wife died  she arranged the widowed de Melo s second marriage to the daughter of the Austrian Field Marshal Leopold Josef  Count von Daun  King John V of Portugal  however  was not pleased and recalled Melo to Portugal in 1749  John V died the following year and his son  Joseph I of Portugal was crowned  In contrast to his father  Joseph I was fond of de Melo  and with the Queen Mother s approval  he appointed Melo as Minister of Foreign Affairs  As the King s confidence in de Melo increased  the King entrusted him with more control of the state  By 1755  Sebasti o de Melo was made Prime Minister  Impressed by British economic success he had witnessed while Ambassador  he successfully implemented similar economic policies in Portugal  He abolished slavery in Portugal and in the Portuguese colonies in India  reorganized the army and the navy  restructured the University of Coimbra  and ended discrimination against different Christian sects in Portugal  But Sebasti o de Melo s greatest reforms were economic and financial  with the creation of several companies and guilds to regulate every commercial activity  He demarcated the region for production of Port to ensure the wine s quality  and this was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe  He ruled with a strong hand by imposing strict law upon all classes of Portuguese society from the high nobility to the poorest working class  along with a widespread review of the country s tax system  These reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes  especially among the high nobility  who despised him as a social upstart  1755 copper engraving showing Lisbon in flames and a tidal wave overwhelming the ships in the harbor after the 1755 Lisbon earthquake  Disaster fell upon Portugal in the morning of 1 November 1755  when Lisbon was struck by a violent earthquake with an estimated Richter scale magnitude of 9  The city was razed to the ground by the earthquake and the subsequent tidal wave and ensuing fires  18  Sebasti o de Melo survived by a stroke of luck and then immediately embarked on rebuilding the city  with his famous quote   What now  We bury the dead and feed the living   Despite the calamity and huge death toll  Lisbon suffered no epidemics and within less than one year was already being rebuilt  The new downtown of Lisbon was designed to resist subsequent earthquakes  Architectural models were built for tests  and the effects of an earthquake were simulated by marching troops around the models  The buildings and big squares of the Pombaline Downtown of Lisbon still remain as one of Lisbon s tourist attractions  They represent the world s first quake proof buildings citation needed   Sebasti o de Melo also made an important contribution to the study of seismology by designing an inquiry that was sent to every parish in the country  Following the earthquake  Joseph I gave his Prime Minister even more power  and Sebasti o de Melo became a powerful  progressive dictator  As his power grew  his enemies increased in number  and bitter disputes with the high nobility became frequent  In 1758 Joseph I was wounded in an attempted assassination  The T vora family and the Duke of Aveiro were implicated and executed after a quick trial  The Jesuits were expelled from the country and their assets confiscated by the crown  Sebasti o de Melo showed no mercy and prosecuted every person involved  even women and children  This was the final stroke that broke the power of the aristocracy and ensured the victory of the Minister against his enemies  Based upon his swift resolve  Joseph I made his loyal minister Count of Oeiras in 1759  Maria I of Portugal as princess of Brazil  In 1762 Spain invaded Portuguese territory as part of the Seven Years  War  however by 1763 the status quo between Spain and Portugal before the war had been restored  Following the T vora affair  the new Count of Oeiras knew no opposition  Made  Marquis of Pombal  in 1770  he effectively ruled Portugal until Joseph I s death in 1779  However  historians also argue that Pombal s  enlightenment   while far reaching  was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and especially an apparatus for crushing opposition  suppressing criticism  and furthering colonial economic exploitation as well as intensifying book censorship and consolidating personal control and profit  19  The new ruler  Queen Maria I of Portugal  disliked the Marquis because of the power he amassed  and never forgave him for the ruthlessness at which he dispatched the T vora family  and upon her accession to the throne  she did what she had long vowed to do  she withdrew all his political offices  Pombal died peacefully on his estate at Pombal in 1782  In the autumn of 1807  Napoleon moved French troops through Spain to invade Portugal  From 1807 to 1811  British Portuguese forces would successfully fight against the French invasion of Portugal  while the royal family and the Portuguese nobility  including Maria I  relocated to the Portuguese territory of Brazil  at that time a colony of the Portuguese

of Brazil under Portuguese rule  Portugal began a slow but inexorable decline until the 20th century  This decline was hastened by the independence in 1822 of the country s largest colonial possession  Brazil  In 1807  as Napoleon Bonaparte s army closed in on Portugal s capital city of Lisbon  the Prince Regent Jo o VI of Portugal transferred his court to Brazil and established Rio de Janeiro as the capital of the Portuguese Empire  In 1815  the Portuguese Empire changed its name to the United Kingdom of Portugal  Brazil and the Algarves  Due to the change in its status and the arrival of the Portuguese royal family  Brazilian administrative  civic  economical  military  educational  and scientific apparatus were expanded and highly modernized  Portuguese and their allied British troops fought against the French Invasion of Portugal and by 1815 the situation in Europe had cooled down sufficiently that Jo o VI would be able to safely return to Lisbon  However  the King of Portugal remained in Brazil until the Liberal Revolution of 1820  which started in Porto  demanded his return to Lisbon in 1821  Thus he returned to Portugal but left his son Pedro in charge of Brazil  When the king attempted the following year to return the Kingdom of Brazil to subordinate status as a principality  his son Pedro  with the overwhelming support of the Brazilian elites  declared Brazil s independence from Portugal  Cisplatina  today s sovereign state of Uruguay   in the south  was one of the last additions to the territory of Brazil under Portuguese rule   edit  Colonial Portuguese

 Luanda  Benguela  Bissau  Louren o Marques  Porto Amboim and the Island of Mozambique were among the oldest Portuguese founded port cities in its African territories  During this phase  Portuguese colonialism focused on expanding its outposts in Africa into nation sized territories to compete with other European powers there  With the Conference of Berlin of 1884  Portuguese Africa territories had their borders formally established on request of Portugal in order to protect the centuries long Portuguese interests in the continent from rivalries enticed by the Scramble for Africa  Portuguese Africa s cities and towns like Nova Lisboa  S  da Bandeira  Silva Porto  Malanje  Tete  Vila Junqueiro  Vila Pery and Vila Cabral were founded or redeveloped inland during this period and beyond  New coastal towns like Beira  Mo  medes  Lobito  Jo o Belo  Nacala and Porto Am lia  were also founded  Even before the turn of the 20th century  railway tracks as the Benguela railway in Angola  and the Beira railway in Mozambique  started to be built to link coastal areas and selected inland regions  Other episodes during this period of the Portuguese presence in Africa include the 1890 British Ultimatum  This forced the Portuguese military to retreat from the land between the Portuguese colonies of Mozambique and Angola  most of present day Zimbabwe and Zambia   which had been claimed by Portugal and included in its  Pink Map   which clashed with British aspirations to create a Cape to Cairo Railway  The Portuguese territories in Africa were Cape Verde  S o Tom  and Pr ncipe

were fertile ground for chaos and unrest during the Portuguese First Republic  which aggravated by the Portuguese military intervention in World War I  led to a military coup d  tat in 1926 and the creation of the National Dictatorship  Ditadura Nacional   This in turn led to the establishment of the right wing dictatorship of the Estado Novo under Ant nio de Oliveira Salazar in 1933  Portugal was one of only five European countries to remain neutral in World War II  From the 1940s to the 1960s  Portugal was a founding member of NATO  OECD and the European Free Trade Association  EFTA   Gradually  new economic development projects and relocation of white mainland Portuguese citizens into the overseas colonies in Africa were initiated  with Angola and Mozambique  as the largest and

by the Republic of Dahomey was the start of a process that led to the final dissolution of the centuries old Portuguese Empire  According to the census of 1921 S o Jo o Baptista de Ajud  had 5 inhabitants and  at the moment of the ultimatum by the Dahomey Government  it had only 2 inhabitants representing Portuguese Sovereignty  Another forcible retreat from overseas territories occurred in December 1961 when Portugal refused to relinquish the territories of Goa  Daman and Diu  As a result  the Portuguese army and navy were involved in armed conflict in its colony of Portuguese India against the Indian Armed Forces  The operations resulted in the defeat of the limited Portuguese defensive garrison  which was forced to surrender to a much larger military force  The outcome was the loss of the remaining Portuguese territories in the Indian subcontinent  The Portuguese regime refused to recognize Indian sovereignty over the annexed territories  which continued to be represented in Portugal s National Assembly until the military coup of 1974  Also in the early 1960s  independence movements in the Portuguese overseas provinces of Angola  Mozambique and Guinea in Africa

Salazar and from 1968 onwards led by Marcelo Caetano  tried to preserve a vast centuries long intercontinental empire with a total area of 2 168 071 km2  21  The Portuguese government and army successfully resisted the decolonization of its overseas territories until April 1974  when a bloodless left wing military coup in Lisbon  known as the Carnation Revolution  led the way for the independence of the overseas territories in Africa and Asia  as well as for the restoration of democracy after two years of a transitional period known as PREC  Processo Revolucion rio Em Curso  or On Going Revolutionary Process   This period was characterized by social turmoil and power disputes between left  and right wing political forces  Some factions  including  lvaro Cunhal s Partido Comunista Portugu s  PCP   unsuccessfully tried to turn the country into a communist state  The retreat from the overseas territories and the acceptance of its independence terms by Portuguese head representatives for overseas negotiations  which would create newly independent communist states in 1975  most notably the People s Republic of Angola and the People s Republic of Mozambique   prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from Portugal s African territories  mostly from Portuguese Angola and Mozambique   22  23  M rio Soares  Prime Minister of Portugal from 1976 to 1978 and from 1983 to 1985  Over a million destitute Portuguese refugees fled the former Portuguese colonies  M rio Soares and Ant nio de Almeida Santos were charged with organising the independence of Portugal s overseas territories  By 1975  all the Portuguese African territories were independent and Portugal held its first democratic elections in 50 years  However  the country continued to be governed by a military civilian provisional administration until the Portuguese legislative election of 1976 that took place on 25 April  exactly one year after the previous election  and two years

would be Prime Minister from 1976 to 1978 and again from 1983 to 1985  In this capacity Soares tried to resume the economic growth and development record that had been achieved before the Carnation Revolution  during the last decade of the previous regime  On the other hand  he initiated the process of adhesion to the European Economic Community  EEC  by starting adhesion negotiations as early as 1977  However  the country bounced between socialism and adherence to the neoliberal model  Land reform and nationalizations were enforced  the Portuguese Constitution  approved in 1976  was rewritten in order to accommodate socialist and communist principles  Until the constitutional revisions of 1982 and 1989  the constitution was a highly charged ideological document with numerous

is characterized by three coexisting systems  the National Health Service  NHS   special social health insurance schemes for certain professions  health subsystems  and voluntary private health insurance  The NHS provides universal coverage  In addition  about 25  of the population is covered by the health subsystems  10  by private insurance schemes and another 7  by mutual funds  The Ministry of Health is responsible for developing health policy as well as managing the NHS  Five regional health administrations are in charge of implementing the national health policy objectives  developing guidelines and protocols and supervising health care delivery  Decentralization efforts have aimed at shifting financial and management responsibility to the regional level  In practice  however  the autonomy of regional health administrations over budget setting and spending has been limited to primary care  The NHS is predominantly funded through general taxation  Employer  including the state  and employee contributions represent the main funding sources of the health subsystems  In addition  direct payments by the patient and voluntary health insurance premiums account for a large proportion of funding  Similar to the other Eur A countries  most Portuguese die from noncommunicable diseases  Mortality from cardiovascular diseases  CVD  is higher than in the Eurozone

died in the first year of life  It is now around 3 deaths per a 1000 newborns  This improvement was mainly due to the decrease in neonatal mortality  from 15 5 to 3 4 per 1000 live births  People are usually well informed about their health status  the positive and negative effects of their behaviour on their health and their use of health care services  Yet their perceptions of their health can differ from what administrative and examination based data show about levels of illness within populations  Thus  survey results based on self reporting at the household level complement other data on health status and the use of services  Only one third of adults rated their health as good or very good in Portugal  Kasmel et al   2004   This is the lowest of the Eur A countries reporting and reflects the relatively adverse situation of the country in terms of mortality and selected morbidity  83   edit  Culture Main article  Culture of Portugal Bel m Tower  Lisbon  A UNESCO World Heritage
