ranked them the No  1 greatest hip hop group of all time  and stated  No weapon in hip hop history can rival the chaotic cohesion of the Wu Tang Clan  The Clan had so many characters  each with his own eccentricities  They were fearless in their approach  There s a good reason no group has been able to successfully recreate their sound  The crew spawned countless loosely associated acts  Their classic albums spawned classic albums   3  Kris Ex of Rolling Stone called Wu Tang Clan  the best rap group ever   4  In 2004  NME hailed them as one of the most influential groups of the last ten

and name The founders of the Wu Tang Clan were cousins Robert Diggs  Gary Grice  Russell Tyrone Jones  RZA  GZA  and Ol  Dirty Bastard respectively  2  who had formed the group Force of the Imperial Master  later known as All in Together Now after the release of a popular single by that name   The group attracted the attention of figures in the hip hop music industry  including Biz Markie  6  but did not manage to secure a record deal  All In Together Now was never signed to a record label  See  me  GZA and ODB had a crew called FOI  Force Of The Imperial Master  nah mean  We made a song  called  All in Together Now   which became famous on tapes throughout Brooklyn  Downtown Staten Island  New York  all the way down to Miami  I remember Biz Markie  when he was famous and I wasn t famous  and he was like   Yo  I heard that shit  Your song with Ason Unique and the Specialist   I was the Scientist  So we never got signed as a group back then  We never had a serious record deal under that title  7   RZA The Wu Tang Clan was assembled in 1992 with RZA as the de facto leader and the group s producer  2  RZA and Ol  Dirty Bastard adopted the name for the group after the film Shaolin and Wu Tang  8  The group s debut album loosely adopted a Shaolin vs  Wu Tang theme  dividing the album into Shaolin and Wu Tang sections  9  The group developed backronyms for the name  as hip hop pioneers such as KRS One and Big Daddy Kane did with their names   including  We Usually Take All Niggas  Garments    Witty Unpredictable Talent And Natural Game   and  Wisdom of the Universe  and the Truth of Allah for the Nation of the Gods   8   edit  Enter the Wu Tang  36 Chambers  and solo albums The Wu Tang Clan first became known in 1993 following the release of the independent single  Protect Ya Neck   which immediately gave the group a sizable underground following  especially after their tour with Kat Nu and Cypress Hill  Though there was some difficulty in finding a record label that would sign the Wu Tang Clan while still allowing each member to record solo albums with other labels  Loud RCA finally agreed  releasing their debut album  Enter the Wu Tang  36 Chambers   in 1993  This album turned out to be critically acclaimed  and to date is regarded as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time  10  11  12  The success of Enter the Wu Tang  36 Chambers established the group as a creative and influential force in mid 1990s hip hop  allowing Ol  Dirty Bastard  GZA  RZA  Raekwon  U God  Method Man  and Ghostface Killah to negotiate solo contracts  RZA spoke on the Wu Tang Clan s unorthodox business model  We reinvented the way hip hop was structured  and what I mean is  you have a group signed to a label  yet the infrastructure of our deal was like anyone else s       We still could negotiate with any label we wanted  like Meth went with Def Jam  Rae stayed with Loud  Ghost went with Sony  GZA went with Geffen Records  feel me        And all these labels still put  Razor Sharp Records  on the credits       Wu Tang was a financial movement  So what do you wanna diversify           Your assets  13   RZA  edit  First round of solo albums RZA was the first to follow up on the success of Enter the Wu Tang with a side project  founding the Gravediggaz with Prince Paul and Frukwan  both of Stetsasonic  and Poetic  The Gravediggaz released 6 Feet Deep in August 1994  which became one of the best known works to emerge from hip hop s small sub genre of horrorcore  2  It had always been planned for Method Man to be the first breakout star from the group s lineup  with the b side of the first single being his now classic eponymous solo track  In November 1994 his solo album Tical was released  It was entirely produced by RZA  who for the most part continued with the grimy  raw textures he explored on 36 Chambers  RZA s hands on approach to Tical extended beyond his merely creating the beats to devising song concepts and structures  2  The track  All I Need  from Tical was the winner of the  Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group  at the 1995 Grammy Awards  14  After the release of Method Man s Tical  Ol  Dirty Bastard was the next member to launch a solo career  His debut album Return to the 36 Chambers  The Dirty Version was released in March 1995  and is considered a hip hop classic  12  Late summer  and early fall of 1995 saw the release of Raekwon s Only Built 4 Cuban Linx     and GZA s Liquid Swords  which would turn out to be the group s two most significant and well received solo projects  Cuban Linx was a diverse  theatrical criminological epic that saw RZA move away from the raw  stripped down beats of the early albums and towards a richer  cinematic sound more reliant on strings and classic soul samples  The album is highly notable in that it revived  and expanded the Mafioso rap sub genre  which started to decline several years beforehand  Lavish living and the crime underworld are referenced throughout using quotes from the John Woo movie The Killer  with the mystique of the Wu Tang Clan deepened by the adoption of crime boss aliases and the crew name Wu Gambinos  The album introduced a flurry of slang words to the rap lexicon  and many artists have gone on to imitate its materialism  Cuban Linx featured all but one Wu member  and featured the debut from close Wu Tang affiliate Cappadonna  The album also featured rapper Nas  who was the first non Wu Tang affiliated MC to appear on a Wu Tang Clan album  GZA s Liquid Swords had a similar focus on inner city criminology akin to Only Built 4 Cuban Linx  but it was far darker  both in GZA s grim lyrics and in the ominous  foreboding production that saw RZA experimenting more with keyboards than ever before  Liquid Swords features guest appearances from every Wu Tang Clan member  and is linked together by excerpts from the movie Shogun Assassin  1995 also saw the release of the Wu Wear clothing line  which would turn out to be massively successful  and influential on hip hop culture  It initially started as a mere way to make money from the demand for bootleg Wu Tang Clan shirts  and evolved into an extensive collection of designer garments  Soon  other hip hop artists were making similar ventures and by the mid 2000s  a clothing line was almost a prerequisite for hip hop superstardom  with clothing lines launched by Puff Daddy  Jay Z  Busta Rhymes  Nelly  Ludacris  50 Cent  and more  Almost a year after the release of Liquid Swords  Ghostface Killah released his first solo album  Ironman in late October 1996  The album struck a balance between the sinister keyboard laden textures of Liquid Swords and the sentimental soul samples of Cuban Linx  while Ghostface himself explored new territory as a lyricist  Ironman was critically acclaimed and is still widely considered to be one of the best of Wu Tang solo albums  15  Although the 1994 1996 albums were released as solo  RZA s presence behind the production  and the large number of guest appearances from other Wu Tang Clan members has rendered them to be mostly all round group efforts  In 1996  the group appeared on the Red Hot Organization s compilation CD  America Is Dying Slowly  alongside Biz Markie  Coolio  and Fat Joe  among many other prominent hip hop artists  The CD  meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African American men  was heralded as  a masterpiece  by The Source magazine   edit  Wu Tang Forever and diversification With their solo careers firmly established  the Wu Tang Clan reassembled to release the highly anticipated Grammy nominated multiplatinum double album Wu Tang Forever in June 1997  debuting at number one on the Billboard Charts  This event was featured in a CNN roundup for the extraordinary sales the group achieved without a mainstream sound or commercial appeal  The album s first single   Triumph   was over five minutes long  featured nine verses  one from each member plus Cappadonna and excluding ODB who appeared on the intro and bridge   and no hook or a repeated phrase  The sound of the album built significantly on the previous three solo albums  with RZA using more keyboards and string samples  as well as  for the first time  assigning some of the album s production to his prot g s True Master and 4th Disciple  The group s lyrics differed significantly from those of 36 Chambers  with many verses written in a dense stream of consciousness form heavily influenced by the teachings of the Five Percent Nation  According to Nielsen SoundScan  the album has sold over 8 3 million copies to date worldwide  Wu Tang Forever also marked the end of RZA s  five year plan   After    Forever s success  RZA ceased to oversee all aspects of Wu Tang product as he had done previously  delegating much of his existing role to associates such as Oliver  Power  Grant and his brother Mitchell  Divine  Diggs  This move was designed to expand Wu Tang s reach in the industry and take advantage of financial opportunities for the group  In keeping with this move  an array of Wu Tang products  both musical and otherwise  were to be released over the next two years  Following Wu Tang Forever  the focus of the Wu Tang empire largely shifted to the promoting of emerging affiliated artists  The group s close associate Cappadonna followed the group project with March 1998 s The Pillage  Soon after  Killah Priest  another close associate of the Clan  released Heavy Mental to great critical acclaim  Affiliated groups Sunz of Man and Killarmy also released well received albums  followed by Wu Tang Killa Bees  The Swarm a compilation album showcasing these and more Wu affiliated artists  and including new solo tracks from the group members themselves  The Swarm sold well and was certified gold  16  There was also a long line of releases from secondary affiliates such as Popa Wu  Shyheim  GP Wu  and Wu Syndicate  Second albums from Gravediggaz and Killarmy  as well as a greatest hits album and a b sides compilation also eventually saw release   edit  Second round of solo albums While this round was commercially successful  it was not as critically acclaimed as its predecessor  The second round of solo albums from Wu Tang saw second efforts from the five members who had already released albums  as well as debuts from all the remaining members  with the exception of Masta Killa  In the space of two years  RZA s Bobby Digital In Stereo  Method Man Tical 2000  Judgement Day and Blackout   with Redman   GZA s Beneath the Surface  Ol  Dirty Bastard s Nigga Please  U God s Golden Arms Redemption  Raekwon s Immobilarity  Ghostface Killah s Supreme Clientele and Inspectah Deck s Uncontrolled Substance were all released  seven of them being released in the space of seven months between June 1999 and January 2000   RZA also composed the score for the film Ghost Dog  The Way of the Samurai  directed by Jim Jarmusch  while he and other Wu Tang members contributed music to a companion  music inspired by the film  album  Wu Tang branded clothing and video games were marketed as well  The Wu Wear clothing line  previously mentioned  in particular was massively influential  and successful  The avalanche of Wu Tang product between 1997 and 2000 was considered by some critics to have resulted in an oversaturation that was responsible for Wu Tang s decline in popularity  or at least in critical regard during that time period  17  Reviews such as Melody Maker s writeup on Ghostface Killah s Supreme Clientele in January 2000 which began  Another month  another Wu Tang side project  revealed critics  exhaustion at the Clan s prodigious output  The overall reception for the second round of Clan member solo albums was decidedly mixed if largely positive  and they did not live up to their pre    Forever forebears critically  Occasional albums would still receive critical acclaim  Ghostface Killah s Supreme Clientele being one of them  is regarded as one of the best solo efforts from the Clan  while Method Man and ODB remained popular in their own right as solo artists  and Wu Tang remained as a well known force  but they had seemingly lost the ability to excite the music world in the way they had throughout the earlier  and mid 1990s  Many fans and critics also bemoaned the lack of RZA s input on the post    Forever solo albums  which were mostly produced by the Wu Element producers  other lower ranking affiliates  or by outside producers such as the Trackmasters or the Neptunes   edit  The W  Iron Flag and New Millennium The group reconvened once again to make The W  though without Ol  Dirty Bastard  who was at the time incarcerated in California for violating the terms of his probation  Though incarcerated  ODB managed to make it onto the track  Conditioner  which featured Snoop Dogg  ODB s vocals were recorded via the telephones used for inmates to talk with visitors  while in prison  The W was mostly well received by critics  18  particularly for The RZA s production  and also gave the group a hit single with the uptempo  Gravel Pit   part of a trilogy of videos where the group would visit different eras with a time traveling elevator  which also included  Protect Ya Neck  The Jump Off   and  Careful  Click  Click    which were then followed by  I Can t Go to Sleep  featuring Isaac Hayes  The album would go on to reach double platinum status  Shortly before the release of The W  ODB escaped custody while being transported from a rehab center to a Los Angeles court and was considered a fugitive  At a record release party for The W  ODB appeared with his face hidden by an orange parka  and was not recognized until introduced to the crowd  With police officers present outside  ODB performed briefly and then fled  fearing capture  Six days later ODB caused a commotion  signing autographs in a McDonald s at Broad  amp  Girard Street in North Philadelphia  Unaware of who was causing the commotion  the manager called the police  When the law arrived  ODB mistook them for fans until they drew their guns  ODB fled the facility  but was stopped while trying to start his vehicle  After presenting a fake ID  he admitted his real identity  and was arrested  19   edit  Iron Flag In 2001  the Wu Tang Clan released Iron Flag  an album which made extensive use of outside producers and guests  Its crossover vibe and features  including Ron Isley  Flavor Flav  and prominent producers Trackmasters  marked it as a lighter fare  while critically praised  it gained a less than stellar reputation with fans  Group member Ghostface Killah would later denounce the record  While originally featured on the cover of Iron Flag  Cappadonna was airbrushed out of the artwork and absent from the album entirely  This may be related to tension that arose within the group when it was revealed that Cappadonna s manager was  or had been  a police informant  a revelation that also brought on the manager s subsequent firing  20  Cappadonna would however  continue collaborating and touring with the group in the upcoming years  Around this time Method Man began his acting career  along with close collaborator  Redman by starring in the stoner comedy film How High   edit  Legal issues  death of Ol  Dirty Bastard and resurgence  edit  U God dispute In early 2004  U God apparently left the group in disgust  A DVD titled Rise of a Fallen Soldier was released detailing his problems  which were mostly with his treatment by RZA  who he claimed had hindered his success as a solo artist  He also formed a new group of young proteg s called the Hillside Scramblers  with whom he released the album U Godzilla Presents the Hillside Scramblers in March 2004  The dispute culminated in a heated phone conversation between RZA and U God on live radio  which ultimately saw the two reconcile  He has since returned to the group and is heavily featured on solo albums  Wu albums  and projects   edit  Live and Best Of albums 2004 saw the unexpected return of the Clan to the live stage  They embarked on a short European tour before coming together as a complete group for the first time in several years to headline the Rock the Bells festival in California  The concert was released on CD shortly afterwards under the name Disciples of the 36 Chambers  Chapter 1  At this time they also released a music video greatest hits album named Legend of the Wu Tang Clan   edit  Death of Ol  Dirty Bastard Ol  Dirty Bastard s career in Wu Tang was marked by wild and criminal behavior  At the 1998 Grammy Awards  he protested the Clan s loss  in Best Rap Album  by interrupting Shawn Colvin s acceptance speech for her Song of the Year award  ODB was also arrested several times for a variety of offenses  including assault  shoplifting  wearing body armor after being convicted of a felony  and possession of cocaine  21  He was also in trouble for missing multiple court dates  In late 2000  Ol  Dirty Bastard unexpectedly escaped near the end of his rehab sentence  spending one month on the run as a fugitive before showing up on stage at the record release party for The W in New York City  Ol  Dirty Bastard managed to escape the club but was later captured by police in a McDonald s parking lot in Philadelphia and sent to New York to face charges of cocaine possession  In April 2001  he was sentenced to two to four years in prison  22  Once released from prison  he signed a one million dollar contract with Roc a Fella Records  On November 13  2004   A date he was scheduled to perform with the rest of the Wu Tang Clan at a reunion concert at Continental Airlines Arena  ODB collapsed at Wu Tang s recording studio  36 Chambers on West 34th Street in New York City  23  He was pronounced dead later that night  just two days shy of his 36th birthday  His funeral service was held at Brooklyn s Christian Cultural Center  Wu Tang has paid him homage on more than one occasion  In August 2006  one of his sons came out at a Wu Tang concert at Webster Hall and rapped  Brooklyn Zoo   along with his mother  Also during a concert at the Hammerstein Ballroom the Clan brought his mother out on stage while the entire occupancy sang along to  Shimmy Shimmy Ya   A posthumous official mixtape titled Osirus featuring many new songs was released in March 2005  while ODB s Roc A Fella album A Son Unique was originally scheduled for release in 2005  but encountered numerous delays  It was then scheduled for a release on November 7  2006 to commemorate the second anniversary of his death  however this did not happen  It was released on November 7  2009 citation needed   to commemorate the 5th anniversary of ODB s death  It was distributed by the Dame Dash Music Group   edit  VH1 Hip Hop honors Moments before the Wu Tang Clan was set to perform at the 2006 Hip Hop Honors  things turned violent with an altercation involving Oli  Power  Grant and a former associate who was suing the group  While initial reports stated that Nick Brown was along for the ride and got arrested for possession of cocaine  the group had issues with VH1 s security staff  an actual confrontation took place between True Master and Power in a VIP area of the venue  said Power   I ain t even gonna glorify that to no type of degree  but the bottom line was  yeah  you know there was a minor little altercation over there   Power said   I see him and he s in the VIP on the strength of Wu Tang so I kind of reacted  be it right or wrong    fuck   The brief altercation between the two men resulted in a tense situation and ended with Power leaving the Hammerstein Ballroom   I ain t even have to leave  I just stood there and talked for  like five or ten minutes  I made sure the rest of my people was able to stay because I told them   look if it was anything then let it be my problem  Let them go ahead and finish doing what they do   I walked out the front  girls started taking some snapshots   24  No charges have been pressed against Oli  Power  Grant or anyone else affiliated with the Clan in relation to this incident   edit  Fourth round of solo albums  8 Diagrams 2005 saw the release of RZA s first book  The Wu Tang Manual  the release of U God s second album  Mr  Xcitement and the long awaited collaboration between GZA and producer DJ Muggs  entitled GrandMasters  The collaborative record received good reviews and played fairly well with fans  who by and large had been waiting to see the Wu step up the quality of their releases  On March 28  2006  Ghostface Killah released the street rap oriented Fishscale  to much critical acclaim and some commercial success  25  The entire Clan  including Cappadonna and the deceased ODB  appeared on the track  9 Milli Bros   The album also offered an expansion of Ghostface s traditional sound precipitated by the moderately successful club song  Be Easy  and battle rhymes in the Just Blaze produced  The Champ   After its reception from fans  label Def Jam asked Ghost to release another album that year  the result  More Fish  excited fans and critics somewhat less  On June 25  2006  Inspectah Deck released a street album entitled The Resident Patient  a prelude to his upcoming album  titled The Rebellion  which is said to be his final solo album  26  Late summer of 2006 saw the release of Masta Killa s second studio album  Made in Brooklyn  to lukewarm reviews  as well as Method Man s 4 21    the Day After  on which the rapper endeavored to make up for the poor response to Tical 0  The Prequel  Around this time  he was heavily featured in the media due to his displeasure with Def Jam s handling of his previous project  Despite what the rapper felt to be little promotion compared to other Def Jam artists  421    debuted in the Billboard Top Ten  and received much greater reviews than those of his previous album  Method Man also made the decision to fall back from Hollywood  and to only do acting work on films being handled by close friends  The summer of 2007 was the original release date scheduled for Raekwon s long anticipated sequel to his 1995 debut Only Built 4 Cuban Linx  entitled Only Built 4 Cuban Linx    Pt  II  The album was to be released on Dr  Dre s Aftermath Records  27  however  it would turn out to be released on Raekwon s Ice H2O Records  and EMI on September 8  2009  after numerous delays  Ghostface Killah released his seventh full length album The Big Doe Rehab in December 2007  and exactly one week later  Wu Tang released their fifth full length group album entitled 8 Diagrams 28  on Steve Rifkind s SRC Records  29  whose now defunct Loud Records released the group s four previous albums  In an interview with MTV com  Ghostface Killah stated that he was upset with RZA for starting the 8 Diagrams project while he was in the middle of writing and recording The Big Doe Rehab  30  and further upset with RZA for giving 8 Diagrams the same release date as The Big Doe Rehab  for which RZA re scheduled a release date one week later  31  The final outcome of 8 Diagrams received mixed views from both fans and critics  and is regarded as being RZA s most experimental work to date  32  Both Raekwon and Ghostface Killah were unhappy with the album  and proposed recording a group album titled  Shaolin Vs  Wu Tang  without RZA production  33  In the summer of 2008  RZA released Digi Snacks  which was another Bobby Digital album  He used the album primarily to put over lesser known Wu Tang Clan affiliates such as Freemurder  Killa Sin  Black Knights and others  The summer of 2008 also the release of GZA s Pro Tools album  Almost a year later  U God released his third solo album entitled Dopium  which features guest appearances from several Wu Tang members  and affiliates  among others  and was met with mostly lukewarm reviews  Released one week later was Wu Tang Chamber Music  a side project executively produced by RZA  featuring live instrumentation from a Brooklyn soul band called The Revelations  The album features appearances from five Wu Tang members  along with New York City mainstays AZ  Kool G Rap  Cormega  Havoc  Sean Price  and M O P  The first single from Chamber Music was a track titled  Harbor Masters  featuring Ghostface Killah  Inspectah Deck  and AZ  34  To clear up confusion  RZA spoke about the album to Billboard com    I think the Chamber Music title is very fitting  This music is totally in the chamber  or in the mind frame of Wu Tang like in the  Enter the Wu Tang  36 Chambers   days  But it s not a Wu Tang album  The whole Clan s not on this album  But it couldn t be in any other category but Wu Tang     RZA  Billboard com  June 25th  2009 35  September 2009 saw the release of the long anticipated album  Only Built 4 Cuban Linx    Pt  II which features guest appearances from several big name artists  and Clan members  with Ghostface being the most prominent  and also production from RZA  Dr  Dre  Pete Rock  and J Dilla  among others  The album debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200 and at number 2 on the Top R amp B Hip Hop Albums chart  and has been praised by most music critics  Several weeks later  Ghostface released Ghostdini  Wizard of Poetry in Emerald City  which is a hip hop R amp B album  Talk of the album Shaolin vs  Wu Tang re surfaced in July 2009  36  originally planned as a full on Wu album without RZA s input  the project evolved to include RZA from an MC standpoint  without contributing to production  Raekwon stated     It ll  be alter egos challenging each other  really allowing RZA to fall back on the production and allowing us to give him a flashback memory to the things we know we need from the abbot  RZA   We want him to be involved  with the album as an MC   but the concept was for him not to be involved production wise     Raekwon  MTV com Speaking to MTV com  Method Man revealed his  Ghostface Killah s and Raekwon s plans to record a separate album as a trio  37    I don t want to say it s written in stone  but it s in discussion  I want some feedback from the fans to see how they would take that  RZA produced tracks  some other outside producers  of course  and we gonna have Wu Tang members on the album  but it ll be a Rae  Ghost and Meth album     Method Man  MTV com Soon after  Ghostface Killah cemented the details  the record featuring other Wu Tang Clan members will consist primarily of him  Method Man  and Raekwon  The title  as announced in three separate trailers  directed by Rik Cordero  promoting the upcoming release  is Wu Massacre  Speaking on their willingness to complete the album  Ghost said the three would begin recording within the next few months and estimated the release date to be the end of 2009 or January 2010  38  More recently  it was announced that the album would be pushed back from December to March 30  2010  39  the single   Meth vs  Chef Part II   was released after the announcement  Produced by Mathematics  it is an update of the song  Meth vs  Chef  from Method Man s first solo album  Tical  featuring verses by only Method Man and Raekwon  It had been confirmed by Raekwon that Shaolin vs  Wu Tang would in fact be his next solo album 40  and that Wu Massacre is a separate project  while the rapper stated that he himself had petitioned to have Wu Massacre s release date postponed in order to yield more studio time  41  On February 25  2011 Wu Tang Live At The Palladium NYC was released through the groups official Facebook page as a collectors digital download  This included exclusive  unreleased freestyles  It was limited to 100 downloads before the page was disabled after this figure was reached   edit  Business deals In September 2008  RZA announced that he had inked a deal with digital music company The Orchard to release the Wu Tang Clan s back

us apart from so many others  Hip hop is alive in Wu Music  and with The Orchard  we ve got a solid partner that understands our audience and is committed to doing all they can to help us reach the fans  I m definitely looking forward to working with them to see what else we all come up with  There s much more to come   42   edit  Documentaries Gerald K  Barclay directed the Wu Tang documentary

and image  Among these contributions have been RZA s sampling style  certain Clan members  mafioso rap personas  usage of slang terms  and the tendency of artists to run in tightly knit groups   edit  Production According to RZA  he tries to have no more than 20 25  sampling on any given record  something starkly different from many other major hip hop groups  He uses  the sampler more like a painter s palette than a Xerox  Then again  I might use it as a Xerox if I find rare beats that nobody had in their crates yet   He played much of the piano himself  with Bill Evans and Thelonious Monk as major influences  for instance  he created the piano part to  Da Mystery of Chessboxin   after watching the Thelonious Monk documentary  Straight  No Chaser  47  RZA s production technique  specifically the manner of chopping up and or speeding or slowing soul samples to fit his beats  has been picked up by currently popular producers  most notably Kanye West and Just Blaze  the two main producers behind Roc A Fella Records  West s own take on RZA s style 48  briefly flooded the rap market with what was dubbed  chipmunk soul   the pitch bending of a vocal sample to where it sounded as though the singer had inhaled helium  Several producers at the time copied the style  creating other offshoots  West has admitted that his style was distinctly influenced by RZA s production  49  and RZA has acknowledged his influence in an issue of Scratch magazine  saying he wished he had produced  Jesus Walks  and  Breathe   two 2004 hits produced by Kanye West and Just Blaze  respectively  Kanye West commented  Wu Tang  Me and my friends talk about this all the time    We think Wu Tang had one of the biggest impacts as far as a movement  From slang to style of dress  skits  the samples  Similar to the  production  style I use  RZA has been doing that  50   edit  Lyrics Raekwon s Only Built 4 Cuban Linx    helped  with the likes of Kool G Rap  popularize the Mafia theme in rap music that remained widespread for more than half a decade  The landmark album touted a lifestyle patterned on drug dealing  regrets of living in harsh conditions  and partying  including popularizing the Cristal brand of champagne  which Nas  Mobb Deep  Notorious B I G   Jay Z  and other popular artists all borrowed and or expanded upon these themes at points in their respective careers  The Wu Tang Clan s slang has long been a staple of their music  wherein members would blend Five Percenter terms  Kung Fu oriental words  and comic book and street terms to create their own nicknames for actions  people  places and things  such as the christening of Staten Island as  Shaolin Land  and money as  C R E A M     RZA noted in the The Wu Tang Manual  that Raekwon was the resident slang master of a great deal of the slang used by the group   edit  Image Before the Wu Tang Clan s debut in 1993  few popular rap music acts operated in large groups  and at nine main members with several affiliates  the Wu was the largest around at that point  No other group was composed of such a large number of skilled rappers and personalities  Since that time  several collective sized groups been recorded together  and gained popular status  including Dipset  G Unit  LA Symphony the Dungeon Family  D12  OFWGKTA  and No Limit Records  Though the Wu Tang Clan may not have been directly responsible for the formation of the group prototype in hip hop  they helped encourage popular acceptance of the idea  They were also among the first to start the trend in hip hop of diversification in fashion  the creation and pioneering of a hip hop clothing line was an idea which was later picked up by Busta Rhymes  Jay Z and Puff Daddy  among others   edit  Syndication  edit  Wu Tang management Oli  Power

wax with skits titled  Clyde Smith  on Supreme Clientele featuring a low pitched recording of what most fans believe to be Raekwon s voice derisively making fun of 50 Cent s behavior and his methods of attracting attention to himself  The skit also joked at other unnamed  gangster rappers  in New York  50 Cent took offense and came back with a short track dissing Wu Tang Clan  and Ghostface in

What   was produced by Easy Mo Bee  who had strong ties to Notorious B I G  as well as several Clan members  such as RZA and GZA  According to Method Man  though even at this point friction was present between Biggie and the Clan  the two rappers got along    It was no secret  Rae didn t like him  Ghost didn t like him  They thought he was a biter  But if you look at Rae and Ghost  they don t like nobody  The rest of my niggas had love for Big  It was just Rae and Ghost   and my niggas  it s like we re a unit  we moved as a unit  So where if one of my niggas ain t speakin   then nobody

cover from Nas  landmark release Illmatic  as well as styles from other rap artists  This generated longstanding controversy over their differences with Biggie  and in later interviews  both rappers would downplay the incident    It was one of them skits where we was looking at our competition  And when Ghost is saying whatever he was saying  we kinda knew who he was talking about  but it wasn t like we was trying to start a beef  It s just sometimes  when you get in the booth and you start saying what you wanna say  it just happened     Raekwon  XXL  The Making of Only Built 4 Cuban Linx

things could have gotten violent  but nothing of the sort ever occurred  It is worth mentioning that on B I G  s final studio album Life After Death he took a shot back at Raekwon on the song  Kick in the Door   which was a diss song to several other rappers as well  with the line   Fuck that  why try Throw bleach in ya eye  which was a response to lyrics from Raekwon s song  Ice Water   where

convict  and start killin  shit   It is also worth mentioning that B I G  chose RZA to produce the track  Long Kiss Goodnight   a song allegedly aimed at Biggie s longtime rival Tupac Shakur  which appeared on Life After Death  RZA went on to comment about the collaboration  saying    Biggie was always pretty cool with me  He liked the Wu Tang sound  He requested me to be on the album  I didn t know if everybody in his camp agreed with it   but we was always cool with each other   at the end he s talking about everybody was fucking with them at that time  He could have even been talking

posted in Vibe magazine  Throughout the video  Budden gave examples of rappers who were ranked too high  and claimed to be better than half of the rappers on the list  Some of the people he mentioned were Melle Mel  Prodigy  Ol  Dirty Bastard  and Method Man  At the end of the video  he went on to say that he d beat Method Man in a battle if they were face to face  Shortly after this  Budden called into Ed Lover s Power 105 1  and took his claim on Method Man even further by stating   Lyrically  I will cut that man s head off his shoulders   Several weeks later  Joe Budden did a freestyle track titled  D O A  Freestyle   which many speculated of containing subliminal shots towards Method Man and several members of Wu Tang  Method Man was overseas while all of this occurred  but eventually spoke out about it on several radio interviews  While Raekwon was on the Rock the Bells tour with Joe Budden and his group Slaughterhouse  the two got together to settle any bad blood  This calmed things down for a short while  until Wu Tang member Inspectah Deck released a Joe Budden diss track entitled  House Nigga   which was a response to Budden s remarks  A few days after releasing this track  on July 9  2009  Deck went on stage at the Columbia  MD show of Rock the Bells  during Raekwon s set  and told the audience the reason for the diss track was because  the nigga tried to diss my brother  he tried to shit on my nigga like my nigga aint a made man     fuck Joe Budden   referring to what Budden said about Method Man   Joe Budden did not retaliate with a diss track  but however  posted a five minute video blog in which he said that he wanted to slap Deck and called Deck a coward  At the San Bernardino stop of Rock the Bells  Raekwon approached Budden with his Ice Water Inc  entourage  resulting in Budden getting punched in the right eye  Shortly after this occurred  Joe Budden posted yet another online video blog of him with an ice pack over his eye  with many speculating Raekwon as the one who did the assault  It was later revealed that the punch was thrown by a member of Raekwon s entourage named Hanz  68  Hanz stated that he  did not appreciate Budden speaking disrespectfully about Inspectah Deck and Method Man in interviews over the summer   He further commented  I punched him in the face because he was outta line  I look at him like  not the school yard bully  but the motherfucker that s always picking on a motherfucker that don t fuck with nobody  To say something about a nigga like Meth is crazy  Meth don t fuck with nobody  I m not gonna sit here and say Rae made me do it  that was a spontaneous decision on my own  I m glad I did it   cause he got a big mouth   It wasn t actually planned  he could have actually changed that whole situation as it unfolded  as it went on   68  Although Joe Budden and Raekwon reportedly were sat down and forced to settle things on the final day of the tour  Budden released a video on his website challenging Raekwon to a one on one fight  and called on all his fans to help persuade Raekwon to accept  despite the fact that it wasn t Raekwon who threw the punch  Raekwon however did not accept  and explained that he is a grown man with a family  and that fighting would be childish  69  He also stated  This has never ever been a Wu Tang versus Slaughterhouse thing  this is about a kid who gets off on doing blogs  My thing is this  I m a business man  I m here to make money  take care of my family and keep as many people safe and sound as possible  We not gonna take it there  cause that s little shit  we are grown men  I will never jump out the window to sacrifice the situation with my family for something that ain t worth it   68  Since the incident  Budden has stated in

second album Supreme Clientele with  saving the Wu   He has enjoyed similar success over the course of eight solo albums  more than any other member of the group  GZA  born Gary Grice  1966    He is the oldest member of the group as well as the most experienced  having begun rapping in 1976  when hip hop was still a local New York phenomenon  85  He was also the first to release an album  Words from the Genius  which was released in 1991 on Cold Chillin  Reprise  The interplay between and other members on the group s recordings shows him as the wisest MC of the group  He is known for his laid back flow  deliberate style  and complex use of metaphor  containing references to Samurai films  chess and 5 Percenter teachings  Liquid Swords  his Wu Tang debut album  is often considered among the group s best work  perhaps only challenged by Raekwon s Only Built 4 Cuban Linx     Inspectah Deck  born Jason Hunter  1970    He was one of the star members of the group  gaining attention by providing stand out performances on both Wu Tang albums and on other member s solo albums as well as being a popular guest rapper in 1997 and 1998  He is considered by many in the fanbase as the stand out member on Wu Tang Forever  although his later solo albums failed to live up to the high expectations  Inspectah Deck is known for his ability to use metaphors and deliver complicated rhyme schemes  He is also a successful producer  providing beats for many artists both in and out of the Wu Tang family such as Ghostface Killah  Method Man  Big Pun  Prodigy and others  Masta Killa  born Elgin Turner  1969    He was the only member not already an experienced rapper at the time of the group s formation  and was extensively mentored by GZA during his early days with the group  He was largely absent on the group s first album due to his being incarcerated  though he did contribute the classic final verse to the track  Da Mystery of Chessboxin   He also had stand out verses to Wu

whom he also made an album in 1999 titled Blackout  as well as the 2009 sequel Blackout  2  Method Man s friendship with the Notorious B I G  is credited for preventing more heat between Biggie  Raekwon and Ghostface  87  Ol  Dirty Bastard  born Russell Jones  1968 2004    Arguably the most eccentric and erratic member of the group  his wild behavior drew significant media   and often police   attention  He was known for his off beat rhymes  charismatic ululations  slightly garbled style  and unpredictable vocal inflections  ODB was among the most popular members of Wu Tang  with high sales and guest spots with industry giants like Mariah Carey  He collapsed in Wu Tang s recording studio on November 13  2004 and was pronounced dead less than an hour later  with a later autopsy

His lyrics contain extensive use of New York slang  and some of which he invented   which is often delivered in an aggressive  fast paced manner  He is also known for his vivid storytelling about wealth  power  and prestige derived from the illegal drug trade  His influential solo album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx    is often credited with initiating the Mafioso rap phenomenon of the mid to late 1990s  and is generally considered one of the best of the solo albums by both fans and critics  The sequel to the influential album was released in late 2009 titled Only Built 4 Cuban Linx    Pt  II  U God  born Lamont Hawkins  1970    A founding member with his own solo career  U God s has had a relatively low profile  in part due to his limited exposure  from being incarcerated for most of the recording of 36 Chambers  in which he only delivered short verses on  Da Mystery of Chessboxin   and  Protect Ya Neck   He is known for delivering strong verses  his unique  bass like  voice  and his style of blaxploitation rap  Cappadonna  born Darryl Hill  1969    After growing up as friends with many of the Clan members  Cappadonna made his debut as an affiliate of the Wu Tang Clan on Raekwon s hit single  Ice Cream   He was also a guest star  along with Raekwon  on Ghostface Killah s solo debut album  Ironman  He made his first appearance on a Wu Tang Clan album in 1997 on Wu Tang Forever

group for their concert at 2004 s Rock the Bells  and appeared on 2007 s 8 Diagrams  Cappadonna s current status as an official member is unclear  While long referred to by both the group and fans as the  Unofficial Tenth Member   there is no confirmation on whether he actually became the official tenth member following the death of Ol  Dirty Bastard  While MTV com s biographies of both him and the group claim that he is an official member  88  their subsequent bios on the group s official website do not list him as such  89  90  Also  while his vocals on 8 Diagrams were not marked with  Feat  Cappadonna   much like The W  he does not appear on the front cover with the original eight living members  and is not featured in the album s booklet with a picture  although he is included in the group s shout out s sections  A 2007 interview about the Clan before the release of 8 Diagrams also claims that RZA officially added him as a member  but there are no quotations or statements to
