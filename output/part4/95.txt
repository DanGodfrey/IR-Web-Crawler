Wikipedia Citing sources From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search For a simpler introduction to citing sources  see Wikipedia Referencing for beginners  Various shortcuts redirect here  you may be looking for Wikipedia Reference Desk or Wikipedia Citing Wikipedia   WP CS  redirects here  WP CS may also refer to Wikipedia Clean start  Wikipedia WikiProject Computer science or Wikipedia Use common sense  This page documents an English Wikipedia content guideline  It is a generally accepted standard that editors should attempt to follow  though it is best treated with common sense  and occasional exceptions may apply  Any substantive edit to this page should reflect consensus  When in doubt  discuss first on the talk page  Shortcuts WP CITEWP REF Citations  frequently called references  are an important part of any Wikipedia article  serving to identify the reliable sources on which the information in the article is based  In most cases  citations for specific pieces of information contained in an article are given in the form of footnotes  though they can also appear within the body of an article  Citations that are indicated by a superscript number or other means in a line of text are called inline citations  Wikipedia s Verifiability policy describes when sources should be cited  and what kind of sources are considered reliable  It requires inline citations for any material challenged or likely to be challenged  and for all quotations  anywhere in article space  However  editors are strongly advised to provide citations for all information added to Wikipedia  any detail risks being unexpectedly challenged or even eventually removed  This page contains information on how to place and format citations  Each article should use the same citation method throughout  If an article already has citations  adopt the method in use or seek consensus on the talk page before changing it  While you should try to write citations correctly  what matters most is that you provide enough information to identify the source  Others will improve the formatting if needed  Wikipedia guidelines Behavioral Assume good faith Conflict of

reading Types of citation A full citation fully identifies a reliable source and  where applicable  the place in that source  such as a page number  where the information in question can be found  For example  Rawls  John  A Theory of Justice  Harvard University Press  1971  p  1  This type of citation is usually given as a footnote  and is the most commonly used citation method in Wikipedia articles  An inline citation means any citation added close to the material it supports  for example after the sentence or paragraph  normally in the form of a footnote  A general reference is a citation to a reliable source that supports content  but is not displayed as an inline citation  General references are usually listed at the end of the article in a References section  They may be found in underdeveloped articles  especially when all article content is supported by a single source  They may also be listed by author alphabetically in a References section in more developed articles as a supplement to inline citations  A short citation is an inline citation that identifies the place in a source where specific information can be found  but without giving full details of the source   these will have been provided in a general reference  For example  Rawls 1971  p  1  This system is used in some articles  the short citations may be given either as footnotes  or as parenthetical references within the text  In text attribution means saying within the article text itself  not as a mere footnote  where particular statements come from  This is done especially with statements of opinion  uncertain facts  and quotations  Usually the in text attribution does not specify full details of the source text   this is done with a footnote in the normal way  For example  According to John Rawls  5     See In text attribution below  When and why to cite sources By citing sources for Wikipedia content  you enable other editors and readers to verify that the information given is supported by reliable sources  thus improving the credibility of Wikipedia and showing that the material is not original research  You also help readers find additional information on the subject  and you avoid committing plagiarism  by giving credit to the source of your words or ideas   In particular  sources are required for material that is challenged or likely to be challenged   if reliable sources cannot be found for challenged material  it is likely to be removed from the article  Sources are also required when quoting someone  with or without quotation marks  or closely paraphasing a source  However  the citing of sources is not limited to those situations   editors are always encouraged to add or improve citations for any information contained in an article  Citations are especially desirable for statements about living persons  particularly when the statements are contentious or potentially defamatory  In accordance with the biography of living persons policy  unsourced information of this type is likely to be removed on sight  Citations are not used on disambiguation pages  sourcing for the information given there should be done in the target articles   Citations are also often discouraged in the lead section of an article  insofar as it summarizes information for which sources are given later in the article  although such things as quotations and particularly controversial statements should be supported by citations even in the lead  For an image or other media file  details of its origin and copyright status should appear on its file page  Image captions should be referenced as appropriate just like any other part of the article  A citation is not needed for descriptions such as alt text that are verifiable directly from the image itself  of for text that merely identifies a source  e g   the caption  Belshazzar s Feast  1635   for File Rembrandt Belsazar jpg   Inline citations Shortcut  WP INCITE Further information  Wikipedia Inline citation Inline citations allow the reader to associate a given bit of material in an article with the specific reliable source s  that support the material  Inline citations are most commonly added using either footnotes  long or short  or parenthetical references  This section describes how to add either type  and also describes how to create a list of full bibliography citations to support shortened footnotes or parenthetical references  Footnotes See also  Help Footnotes How to place an inline citation using ref tags Shortcut  WP CITEFOOT To create a footnote  use the  lt ref gt     lt  ref gt  syntax at the appropriate place in the article text  for example  Justice is a human invention  lt ref gt Rawls  John    A Theory of Justice    Harvard University Press  1971  p  1  lt  ref gt  It    which will be displayed as something like  Justice is a human invention  1  It    It will also be necessary to generate the list of footnotes  where the citation text is actually displayed   for this  see the next section  As in the above example  citation markers are normally placed after adjacent punctuation such as periods and commas  For exceptions  see the Punctuation and footnotes section of the Manual of Style  Note also that no space is added before the citation marker  The citation should be added close to the material it supports  offering text source integrity  If a word or phrase is particularly contentious  an inline citation may be added next to that word or phrase within the sentence  but it is usually sufficient to add the citation to the end of the sentence or paragraph  so long as it s clear which source supports which part of the text  If an infobox or table contains text that needs citing  but the box or table cannot incorporate an inline citation  the citation should appear in a caption or other text that discusses the material  How to create the list of citations The first editor to add footnotes to an article must create a section where the text of those citations appears  This section is placed at or near the bottom of the article and is usually titled  Notes  or  References   For more about the order and titles of sections at the end of an article  which may also include  Further reading  and  External links  sections   see Wikipedia Footers  Shortcut  WP ASL With some exceptions discussed below  citations appear in a single section containing only the  lt references   gt  tag or the   reflist   template  For example    Notes     reflist   The footnotes will then automatically be listed under that section heading  Each numbered footnote marker in the text is a clickable link to the corresponding footnote  and each footnote contains a caret which links back to the corresponding point in the text  Scrolling lists  or lists of citations appearing within a scroll box  should never be used  This is because of issues with readability  browser compatibility  accessibility  printing  and site mirroring  1  If an article contains a list of general references  this is placed in a separate section  titled  for example   References   This usually comes immediately after the section s  listing footnotes  if any   If the general references section is called  References   then the citations section is usually called  Notes    Separating citations from explanatory footnotes If an article contains both footnoted citations and other  explanatory  footnotes  then it is possible  but not necessary  to divide them into two separate lists  using the grouping feature described in the Grouping footnotes section of the footnotes help page  The explanatory footnotes and the citations are then placed in separate sections  called  for example   Notes  and  References  respectively  Repeated citations For multiple use of the same citation or footnote  you can also use the named references feature  choosing a name to identify the citation  and typing  lt ref name  name  gt text of the citation lt  ref gt   Thereafter  the same footnote may be reused any number of times by typing just  lt ref name  name    gt   For more details of this syntax  see Multiple references to the same footnote on the footnotes help page  Avoiding clutter Inline references can significantly bloat the wikitext in the edit window and can be extremely difficult and confusing  There are three methods that avoid clutter in the edit window  list defined references  short citations or parenthetical references   As with other citation formats  articles should not undergo large scale conversion between formats without consensus to do so   Citing multiple pages of the same source When an article cites many different pages from the same source  most Wikipedia editors use short citations in footnotes  Other methods include short citations in parenthesis and the template   rp    Shortcut  WP IBID The use of ibid   Id   or similar abbreviations  is discouraged  as these may become broken as new references are added  op  cit  is less problematic in that it should refer explicitly to a citation contained in the article  however  not all readers are familiar with the meaning of the terms   If the use of ibid is extensive  use the   ibid   template  Short citations Shortcuts  WP CITESHORT WP SFN Main page  Help Shortened footnotes Some Wikipedia articles use short citations  giving summary information about the source together with a page number  as in  lt ref gt Smith 2010  p  1  lt  ref gt   These are used together with general references  which give full details of the sources  but without page numbers  and are listed in a separate  References  section  Short citations are used in articles which apply parenthetical referencing  see below   but they can also be used as footnote citations  as described here  Forms of short citations used include author date referencing  APA style  Harvard style  or Chicago style   and author title or author page referencing  MLA style or Chicago style   As before  the list of footnotes is automatically generated in a  Notes  or  Footnotes  section  which immediately precedes the  References  section containing the general references  Short citations can be written manually  or by using the   sfn   or   harvnb   templates   Note that templates should not be added without consensus to an article that already uses a consistent referencing style   The short citations and general references may be linked so that the reader can click on the short note to find full information about the source  See the template documentation for details and solutions to common problems  For variations with and without templates  see wikilinks to full references  For a set of realistic examples  see these  This is how short citations look in the edit box  The Sun is pretty big  lt ref gt Miller 2005  p  23  lt  ref gt  but the Moon is not so big  lt ref gt Brown 2006  p  46  lt  ref gt  The Sun is also quite hot  lt ref gt Miller 2005  p  34  lt  ref gt    Notes     Reflist     References     Brown  Rebecca  2006    Size of the Moon     Scientific American    51 78    Miller  Edward  2005     The Sun    Academic Press  This is how they look in the article  The Sun is pretty big  1  but the Moon is not so big  2  The Sun is also quite hot  3 Notes   Miller 2005  p  23    Brown 2006  p  46    Miller 2005  p  34  References Brown  Rebecca  2006    Size of the Moon   Scientific American  51 78   Miller  Edward  2005   The Sun  Academic Press  Shortened notes using titles rather than publication dates would look like this in the article  Notes   Miller  The Sun  p  23    Brown   Size of the Moon   p  46    Miller  The Sun  p  34  When using manual links it is easy to introduce errors such as duplicate anchors and unused references  The script User Ucucha HarvErrors will show many related errors  Duplicate anchors may be found by using the W3C Markup Validation Service  Parenthetical referencing Further information  Wikipedia Parenthetical referencing While most articles use footnote citations as described in the above sections  some articles use a parenthetical referencing style  Here  short citations in parentheses  such as  Smith 2010  p  1   are placed within the article text itself  Full details of each source used are given in a general reference  e g  Smith  John  Name of Book  Cambridge University Press  2010  The general references are listed in alphabetical order  according to the authors  surnames  at the end of the article in a  References  section  Several forms of short citation are used in Wikipedia  see Short citations above  The inline citation and general reference may be linked using a template  see linking inline and full citations   as with other citation templates  these should not be added to articles without consensus  This is how it looks in the edit box  The Sun is pretty big  Miller 2005  p  1   but the Moon is not so big  Brown 2006  p  2   The Sun is also quite hot  Miller 2005  p  3     References     Brown  R  2006    Size of the Moon     Scientific American    51 78    Miller  E  2005     The Sun    Academic Press  This is how it looks in the article  The Sun is pretty big  Miller 2005  p  1   but the Moon is not so big  Brown 2006  p  2   The Sun is also quite hot  Miller 2005  p  3  References Brown  R  2006    Size of the Moon   Scientific American  51 78   Miller  E  2005   The Sun  Academic Press  Notice that  unlike footnotes  parenthetical references are placed before adjacent punctuation such as commas and full stops  General references Shortcut  WP GENREF A general reference is a citation to a reliable source that supports content  but is not displayed as an inline citation  General references are usually listed at the end of the article in a  References  section  and are usually sorted by the last name of the author or the editor  Examples of general reference sections are given above  in the sections on short citations and parenthetical references  In addition to their use when short or parenthetical references are used  a general references section may also be included in an article that uses full inline citations  particularly if such citations have not yet been given for all the information in the article  In underdeveloped articles  a general references section may exist even though no inline citations at all have yet been added  especially when all article content is supported by a single source  The disadvantage of using general references alone is that text source integrity is lost  unless the article is very short  What information to include Shortcut  WP CITEHOW Listed below is the information which a typical inline citation or general reference will provide  in order to identify the source  assist readers in finding it  and  in the case of inline citations  indicate the place in the source where the information is to be found   If an article uses parenthetical referencing or short citations  then the inline citations will refer to this information in abbreviated form  as described in the relevant sections above   Books Shortcuts  WP EBOOK WP BOOKLINKS Citations for books typically include the name of the author s   the title of the book  in italics   the volume if applicable  the city of publication  optional   the name of the publisher  the year of publication  and the ISBN number  optional   written using the syntax described at WP ISBN  Inline citations should additionally give the relevant page number or range of page numbers  Chapter numbers can also be given if appropriate  When specifying a page number  it is helpful to specify the date and edition used  as pagination can change between editions  If the source is an e book that does not provide page numbers  the citation should include information that enables readers to locate the source material within the e book  such as chapter number  paragraph number  or a short quote from the source itself  2  Citations for individually authored chapters in books typically include the name of the author  the title of the chapter  the name of the book s editor  name of book  publisher  and year  Do not present the information in a way that implies the editor is the author  When a book is available online through a site such as Internet Archive  Project Gutenberg  Biodiversity Heritage Library  or Google Books  it may be useful to provide a link to the book so readers can view the source  Use the external link syntax  so that clicking on the book title will take the reader to the book  If a specific page in the book is referenced  it may be specified in the link  for example Rawls  John   http   books google com books id kvpby7HtAe0C amp pg PA18   A Theory of Justice     Harvard University Press  1971  p  18  A link to a specific page in a Google Books should only be added if the book is available for preview  such links will not work if the book is only available in snippet view  3  Like other variations on citation styles  there is no requirement either to add or remove such links  Journal articles Citations for journal articles typically include the name of the author s   the year and sometimes month of publication  the title of the article  within quotation marks   the name of the journal  in italics   the volume number  issue number and page numbers  article numbers in some electronic journals   It is also helpful to provide DOI  PMID and or other identifiers where available  Because the Wikipedia is not an academic text  it is better to cite the title of the journal in full  rather than with an academic abbreviation  Inline citations usually also include specific page numbers  as described above for books  If the article is available online  use external link syntax to link the article title to the relevant Web page  for example  Carr A  Ory D  2006    http   dx doi org 10 1371 journal pmed 0030496 Does HIV cause cardiovascular disease     PLoS Medicine    3 11  e496  Newspaper articles Citations for newspaper articles typically include the name of the newspaper  in italics   the date of publication  the byline  author s name  if any  the title of the article  within quotation marks   and the city of publication if not included in the name of the newspaper  Page number s  are optional  If the article is available online  link the article s title to the relevant Web address  as described above for journal articles  Web pages Citations for World Wide Web pages typically include the name of the author s   the title of the article  within quotation marks   the name of the website  the date of publication  if known   the date you retrieved the page  for example Retrieved 2008 07 15   this is required if the publication date is unknown   Page number s  can be added if applicable  Recordings Citations for sound recordings typically include the name of the composer s  script writer s   name of the performer s   title of the song or individual track  in quotation marks   title of the album in italics  if applicable   name of the record label  year of release  medium  for example  LP  audio cassette  CD  MP3 file   Citations for films  TV episodes  or video recordings typically include the name of the director  and the producer if relevant   names of major performers  the title of the episode in quotation marks  if applicable   the title of the film or TV series  in italics   the name of the studio  the year of release  the medium  for example  film  videocassette  DVD   Where applicable  an inline citation should also give the approximate time in the recording at which the event or point of interest occurs  When doing this  be as precise as possible about the version of the source that you are citing  for example  movies are often released in different editions or  cuts   and timings may differ between them  Say where you read it Shortcut  WP SAYWHEREYOUGOTIT Don t cite a source unless you ve seen it for yourself  Where you want to cite John Smith  but you ve only read Paul Jones who cites Smith  write it like this  this formatting is just an example   Smith  John  Name of Book I Haven t Seen  Cambridge University Press  2009  p  1  cited in Paul Jones  ed    Name of Encyclopedia I Have Seen  Oxford University Press  2010  p  2  However  if you have read Smith s book yourself  you may cite it directly  there is no need to give credit to any sources  search engines  websites  library catalogs  etc   that led you to that book  Additional annotation In most cases it is sufficient for a citation footnote simply to identify the source  as described in the sections above   readers can then consult the source to see how it supports the information in the article  Sometimes  however  it is useful to include additional annotation in the footnote  for example to indicate precisely which information the source is supporting  particularly when a single footnote lists more than one source   see Bundling citations and Text source integrity below   A footnote may also contain a relevant exact quotation from the source  if this may be of interest  this is particularly useful if the source is not easily accessible   In the case of non English sources  it may be helpful to quote from the original text and then give an English translation  If the article itself contains a translation of a quote from such a source  without the original   then the original should be included in the footnote  See Non English sources in the verifiability policy for more information  Citation style While citations should aim to provide the information listed above  there is no one single style for doing this  in terms of ordering of the information  punctuation  etc  A consistent style should be used within any given article  but it is not necessary to maintain consistency between articles   for how to deal with variation  see the following section  A number of citation styles exist  some relevant Wikipedia articles include Citation  APA style  MLA style  The Chicago Manual of Style  Author date referencing  Vancouver system and Bluebook   Examples can be found at Wikipedia Citing sources Example style  Although nearly any consistent style may be used  avoid all numeric date formats other than YYYY MM DD  because of the ambiguity concerning which number is the month and which the day  For example  2002 06 11 may be used  but not 11 06 2002  The YYYY MM DD format should in any case be limited to Gregorian calendar dates where the year is after 1582  Variation in citation methods Shortcut  WP CITEVAR As described in various sections of this page  different articles use different citation systems  styles and methods  Points of difference include  whether an article uses full citations  short citations in footnotes  or parenthetical referencing  what the citation reference sections of the article are called  and whether explanatory footnotes are grouped separately from citation footnotes  the styling of the citations themselves  whether citations are produced using citation templates  whether list defined references are used  On all of these points  Wikipedia does not have a single house style  Editors may choose any option they want  one article need not match what is done in other articles  However  citations within a given article should follow a consistent style  It is therefore considered helpful  when adding citations  to try to follow the system and style already in use in the article  if any   to improve existing citations by adding missing information  for example  replacing bare URLs with full bibliographic citations   to replace  or supplement  some or all general references with inline citations  to change existing citations to make them follow a consistent system and style  if there is currently inconsistency within the article  If there is disagreement about which style is best  defer to the style used by the first major contributor or start a discussion on the talk page  if you think another system or style would be more appropriate for the article than what is already in use  propose the change on the talk page  and wait for consensus to emerge  Editors should not attempt to change an article s established citation style merely on the grounds of personal preference  or without first seeking consensus for the change  Handling links in citations As noted above under What information to include  it is helpful to include hyperlinks to source material  when available  Here we note some issues concerning these links  Avoid embedded links Further information  Wikipedia Embedded citations Embedded links to external websites should not be used as a form of inline citation  because they are highly susceptible to linkrot  Wikipedia allowed this in its early years for example by adding a link after a sentence  like this  http   media guardian co uk site story 0 14173 1601858 00 html   which looks like this   1  This is no longer recommended  Raw links are not recommended in lieu of properly written out citations  even if placed between ref tags  like this  lt ref gt  http   media guardian co uk site story 0 14173 1601858 00 html  lt  ref gt   Embedded links should never be used to place external links in the body of an article  like this   Apple  Inc  announced their latest product     Convenience links Main page  Wikipedia Copyrights Linking to copyrighted works A convenience link is a link to a copy of your source on a webpage provided by someone other than the original publisher or author  For example  a copy of a newspaper article no longer available on the newspaper s website may be hosted elsewhere  When offering convenience links  it is important to be reasonably certain that the convenience copy is a true copy of the original  without any changes or inappropriate commentary  and that it does not infringe the original publisher s copyright  Accuracy can be assumed when the hosting website appears reliable  Where several sites host a copy of the material  the site selected as the convenience link should be the one whose general content appears most in line with Wikipedia Neutral point of view and Wikipedia Verifiability  Indicating availability If your source is not available online  it should be available in reputable libraries  archives  or collections  If a citation without an external link is challenged as unavailable  any of the following is sufficient to show the material to be reasonably available  though not necessarily reliable   providing an ISBN or OCLC number  linking to an established Wikipedia article about the source  the work  its author  or its publisher   or directly quoting the material on the talk page  briefly and in context  Links to sources For a source available in hardcopy  microform  and or online  omit  in most cases  which one you read  While it is useful to cite author  title  edition  1st  2d  etc    and similar information  it generally is not important to cite a database such as ProQuest  EbscoHost  or JStor  see the list of academic databases and search engines  or to link to such a database requiring a subscription or a third party s login  The basic bibliographic information you provide should be enough to search for the source in any of these databases that have the source  Don t add a URL that has a part of a password embedded in the URL  However  you may provide the DOI  ISBN  or another uniform identifier  if available  If the publisher offers a link to the source or its abstract that does not require a payment or a third party s login for access  you may provide the URL for that link  And if the source only exists online  give the link even if access is restricted  Preventing and repairing dead links See also  Wikipedia Link rot Shortcut  WP DEADREF To help prevent dead links  persistent identifiers are available for some sources  Some journal articles have a digital object identifier  DOI   some online newspapers and blogs  and also Wikipedia  have permalinks that are stable  When permanent links aren t available  consider archiving the referenced document when writing the article  on demand web archiving services such as WebCite  http   www webcitation org  are fairly easy to use  see pre emptive archiving   Dead links should be repaired or replaced if possible  Do not delete a citation merely because the URL is not working today  Follow these steps when you encounter a dead URL being used as a reliable source to support article content  Confirm status  First  check the link to confirm that it is dead and not temporarily down  Search the website to see whether it has been rearranged  Check for web archives  Several archive services exist  add one of these URLs if available  The Internet Archive and WebCite have billions of archived webpages  See Wikipedia Using the Wayback Machine and Wikipedia Using WebCite  The UK Government Web Archive  http   www nationalarchives gov uk webarchive   preserves 1500 UK central government websites  Note  Most archives currently operate with a delay of  18 months before a link is made public  As a result  editors should wait  24 months after the link is first tagged as dead before declaring that no web archive exists  Dead URLs to reliable sources should normally be tagged with   dead link date March 2012    so that you can estimate how long the link has been dead  Remove convenience links  If the material was published on paper  e g   academic journal  newspaper article  magazine  book   then the URL is not necessary  Simply remove it  Find a replacement source  Search the web for quoted text or the article title  Consider contacting the website person that originally published the reference and asking them to republish it  Ask other editors for help finding the reference somewhere else  Find a different source that says essentially the same thing as the reference in question  Remove hopelessly lost web only sources  If the source material does not exist offline  and if there is no archived version of the webpage  be sure to wait  24 months   and if you are unable to find another copy of the material  then the dead citation should be removed and the material it supports should be regarded as unverifiable  If it is material that is specifically required by policy to have an inline citation  then please consider tagging it with   citation needed    It may be helpful to future editors if you move the citation to the talk page with an explanation  Text source integrity Shortcut  WP INTEGRITY When using inline citations  it is important to maintain text source integrity  The point of an inline citation is to allow readers and other editors to check that the material is sourced  that point is lost if the citation is not clearly placed  The distance between material and its source is a matter of editorial judgment  but adding text without placing its source clearly can lead to allegations of original research  violations of the sourcing policy  and even plagiarism  Editors should exercise caution when rearranging or inserting material to ensure that text source relationships are maintained  When new text is inserted into a paragraph make sure that it is clear what facts the inline citations support  For example The sun is pretty big  1  The sun is also quite hot  2 Notes   Miller  Edward  The Sun  Academic Press  2005  p  1    Smith  John  The Sun s Heat  Academic Press  2005  p  2  Do not add facts into a fully cited paragraph or sentence N The sun is pretty big  but the moon is not so big  1  The sun is also quite hot  3 Notes   Miller  Edward  The Sun  Academic Press  2005  p  1    Smith  John  The Sun s Heat  Academic Press  2005  p  2  without including a source to cover the new information  Y The sun is pretty big  1  but the moon is not so big  2  The sun is also quite hot  3 Notes   Miller  Edward  The Sun  Academic Press  2005  p  1    Brown  Rebecca   Size of the Moon   Scientific American  51 78  46    Smith  John  The Sun s Heat  Academic Press  2005  p  2  Including too many citations within a sentence may be aesthetically unpleasant  The sun is the closest 1  star 2  to the planet Earth  3  but the moon is even closer  4  So consider placing them at a more aesthetically pleasant location  The sun is the closest star to the planet Earth  1  2  3  but the moon is even closer  4  or The sun is the closest star to the planet Earth  but the moon is even closer  1  2  3  4  However this solution brings its own problems  A string of independent citations can also appear aesthetically unpleasant so consider bundling them into one  Identifying which inline citation supports which fact can be more difficult unless additional information is added to the inline citations to explicitly identify what portion of the sentence they cover  Maintenance becomes more difficult  When adding more information to the sentence from yet another source it may be difficult to work out precisely where to place the new citation  If the text is rearranged during a copy edited greater care needs to be taken with rearranging the citations  particularly as the inline citations will be renumbered during their repositioning  For example if the sentence The sun is the closest 1  star 2  to the planet Earth  3  but the moon is even closer  4  is rearranged like this  The moon is closer 1  to planet Earth 2  than the nearest star which is called the sun  3  4  It will be fairly easy to check that the citations support the information in the rearranged sentence  This rearrangement is more difficult to check  The sun is the closest star to the planet Earth  but the moon is even closer  1  2  3  4  The moon is closer to planet Earth than the nearest star which is called the sun  1  2  3  4  Bundling citations Shortcuts  WP CITEBUNDLE WP BUNDLING Further information  Wikipedia Citation overkill Sometimes the article is more readable if multiple citations are bundled into a single footnote  For example  when there are multiple sources for a given sentence  and each source applies to the entire sentence  the sources can be placed at the end of the sentence  like this  4  5  6  7  Or they can be bundled into one footnote at the end of the sentence or paragraph  like this  4  Bundling is useful if the sources each support a different portion of the preceding text  or if the sources all support the same text  Bundling has several advantages  It helps readers and other editors see at a glance which source supports which point  maintaining text source integrity  It avoids the visual clutter of multiple clickable footnotes inside a sentence or paragraph  It avoids the confusion of having multiple sources listed separately after sentences  with no indication of which source to check for each part of the text  such as this  1  2  3  4  It makes it less likely that inline citations will be moved inadvertently when text is re arranged  because the footnote states clearly which source supports which point  When formatting multiple citations in a footnote  there are several layouts available  as illustrated below  Within a given article  only a single layout should be used  The sun is pretty big  but the moon is not so big  The sun is also quite hot  1 Notes Bullets   For the sun s size  see

also  Wikipedia Neutral point of view Attributing and specifying biased statements In text attribution is the attribution inside a sentence of material to its source  in addition to an inline citation after the sentence  In text attribution should be used with direct speech  a source s words between quotation marks   indirect speech  a source s words without quotation marks   and close paraphrasing  It can also be used when loosely summarizing a source s position in your own words  It avoids inadvertent plagiarism  and helps the reader see where a position is coming from  An inline citation should follow the attribution  usually at the end of the sentence or paragraph in question  For example  Y John Rawls argues that  to reach fair decisions  parties must consider matters as if behind a veil of ignorance  2  When using in text attribution  make sure it doesn t lead to an inadvertent neutrality violation  For example  the following implies parity between the sources  without making clear that the position of Dawkins is the majority view  N Richard Dawkins argues that human beings evolved through natural selection  but John Smith writes that we arrived here in pods from Mars  Neutrality issues apart  there are other ways in text attribution can mislead  The sentence below suggests The New York Times has alone made this important discovery  N According to The New York Times  the sun will set in the west this evening  Simple facts such as this can have inline citations to reliable sources as an aid to the reader  but normally the text itself is best left as a plain statement without in text attribution  YBy mass  oxygen is the third most abundant element in the universe after hydrogen and helium  3  Dealing with unsourced material Shortcut  WP NOCITE If an article is unreferenced  you can tag it with the   unreferenced   template  so long as it is not nonsensical or a biography of a living person  in which case request admin assistance  If a claim is doubtful but not harmful  use the   citation needed   template  which will add an inline tag  but remember to go back and remove the claim if no source is produced within a reasonable time  If a claim is doubtful and harmful  remove it from the article  You may want to move it to the talk page and ask for a source  unless it is very harmful or absurd  in which case it should not be posted to the talk page either  Use your common sense  All unsourced and poorly sourced contentious material about living persons must be removed from articles and talk pages immediately  See Wikipedia Biographies

citations written freehand  see Wikipedia Citing sources Example edits for different methods  Citation templates can be used to format citations in a consistent way  The use of citation templates is neither encouraged nor discouraged  an article should not be switched between templated and non templated citations without good reason and consensus   see Variation in citation methods above  If citation templates are used in an article  the parameters should be accurate  It is inappropriate to set parameters to false values in order that the template will be rendered to the reader as if it

on Wikipedia use the COinS standard  Metadata such as this allow browser plugins and other automated software to make citation data accessible to the user  for instance by providing links to their library s online copies of the cited works  In articles that format citations manually  metadata may be added manually in a span  according to the COinS specification  or the templates Template
