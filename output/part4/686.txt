had been estimated based on the reported figure of about 1 million in the 1970s when the country had joined the United Nations and precise statistics were lacking  7  Thus using the annual increase rate of 2 3   the most population estimates were around 2 million in the year 2000  A national census was carried out in 2005 and it turned out that the population was 672 425  Consequently  United Nations Population Division had down estimated the country s population in the 2006 revision 8  for the whole period from 1950 to 2050  2 The Indian rupee is also legal tender  Bhutan  Dzongkha

east and west by the Republic of India and to the north by the People s Republic of China  Bhutan is separated from the nearby country of Nepal to the west by the Indian state of Sikkim  and from Bangladesh to the south by the Indian states of Assam and West Bengal  Bhutan existed as a patchwork of minor warring fiefdoms until the early 17th century  when the area was unified by Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal  who fled religious persecution in Tibet and cultivated a separate Bhutanese identity  In the early 20th century  Bhutan came into contact with the British Empire  after which Bhutan continued strong bilateral relations with India upon its independence  In 2006  Business Week magazine rated Bhutan the happiest country in Asia and the eighth happiest in the world  based on a global survey  9  Bhutan s landscape ranges from subtropical plains in the south to the sub alpine Himalayan heights in the north  with some peaks exceeding 7 000 metres  23 000 ft   The state religion is Vajrayana Buddhism  and the population of 691 141 is predominantly Buddhist  with Hinduism the second largest religion  10  The capital and largest city is Thimphu  In 2007  Bhutan made the transition from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy  holding its first general election  Bhutan is a member of the United Nations and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation  SAARC   it hosted the sixteenth SAARC summit in April 2010  The total area of the country has been reported as 38 394 square kilometres  14 824 sq mi  since 2002  1  2  The area had previously been reported as

Europe around the 1580s  Jean Baptiste Tavernier s 1676 Six Voyages is the first to record the name Boutan  However  in every case  these seem to have been describing not modern Bhutan but the Kingdom of Tibet  The modern distinction between the two did not begin until well into Bogle s 1774 expedition   realizing the differences between the two regions  cultures  and states  his final report to the East India Company formally proposed labeling the Druk Desi s kingdom as  Boutan  and the Panchen Lama s as  Tibet   The EIC s surveyor general James Rennell first anglicized the French name as Bootan and then popularized the distinction between it and greater Tibet  12  1777 1786 Two of Rennell s EIC maps  showing the division of  Thibet or Bootan  into separate regions  The precise etymology of Bhutan is unknown  although it quite probably derives from the Tibetan endonym Bod  used for Greater Tibet  It is traditionally taken to be a transcription of the Sanskrit Bho a anta             end of Tibet    in reference to Bhutan s position as the southern extremity of the Tibetan plateau and culture  13  14  Locally  Bhutan has been known by many names  The earliest western records of Bhutan  the 1627 Relacao of the Portuguese Jesuits Est v o Cacella and Jo o Cabral  records its name variously as Cambirasi  among the Koch Biharis 15    Potente  and Mon  an endonym for southern Tibet   12  The first time a separate Kingdom of Bhutan did appear on a western map  it did so under its local name as  Broukpa   12  Others including Lho Mon   Dark Southland    Lho

Timeline of Bhutanese history Stone tools  weapons  elephants  and remnants of large stone structures provide evidence that Bhutan was inhabited as early as 2000 BC  although there are no existing records from that time  Historians have theorized that the state of Lhomon  literally   southern darkness    or Monyul   Dark Land   a reference to the Monpa  the aboriginal peoples of Bhutan  may have existed between 500 BC and AD 600  The names Lhomon Tsendenjong  Sandalwood Country   and Lhomon Khashi  or Southern Mon  country of four approaches   have been found in ancient Bhutanese and Tibetan chronicles  18  19  Buddhism was first introduced to Bhutan in the 7th century AD  Tibetan king Songts n Gampo 20   reigned 627 49   a convert to Buddhism  ordered the construction of two Buddhist temples  at Bumthang in central Bhutan and at Kyichu  near Paro  in the Paro Valley  21  Buddhism was propagated in earnest 20  in 746 22  under King Sindhu R ja  also K njom  23  Sendha Gyab  Chakhar Gyalpo   an exiled Indian king who had established a government in Bumthang at Chakhar Gutho Palace  24  35 25  13 Buddhist saint Padma Sambhava  also known as Guru Rinpoche  came to Bhutan in in 747  26  Much of early Bhutanese history is unclear because most of the records were destroyed when fire ravaged the ancient capital  Punakha  in 1827  By the 10th century  Bhutan s political development was heavily influenced by its religious history  Various sub sects of Buddhism emerged which were patronized by the various Mongol warlords  After the decline of the Yuan Dynasty in the 14th century  these sub sects vied with each other for supremacy in the political and religious landscape  eventually leading to the ascendancy of the Drukpa sub sect by the 16th century  21  27  Until the early 17th century  Bhutan existed as a patchwork of minor warring fiefdoms  when the area was unified by the Tibetan lama and military leader Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal who had fled religious persecution in Tibet  To defend the country against intermittent Tibetan forays  Namgyal built a network of impregnable dzong  fortresses   and promulgated the Tsa Yig  a code of law that helped to bring local lords under centralized control  Many such dzong still exist and are active centers of religion and district administration  Portuguese Jesuits Est v o Cacella and Jo o Cabral were the first recorded Europeans to visit Bhutan  on their way to Tibet  They met Ngawang Namgyal  presented him with firearms  gunpowder and a telescope  and offered him their services in the war against Tibet  but the Shabdrung declined the offer  After a stay of nearly eight months Cacella wrote a long letter from the Chagri Monastery reporting on his travels  This is a rare extant report of the Shabdrung  28  29  After Ngawang Namgyal s death in 1651  his passing was kept secret for 54 years  after a period of consolidation  Bhutan lapsed into internal conflict  In the year 1711 Bhutan went to war against the Mughal Empire and its Subedars  who restored Koch Bihar in the south  During the chaos that followed  the Tibetans unsuccessfully attacked Bhutan in 1714  30  Map of Bhutan

the Gankyil in its mode as the  Four Joys   In the 18th century  the Bhutanese invaded and occupied the kingdom of Cooch Behar to the south  In 1772  Cooch Behar appealed to the British East India Company which assisted them in ousting the Bhutanese and later in attacking Bhutan itself in 1774  A peace treaty was signed in which Bhutan agreed to retreat to its pre 1730 borders  However  the peace was tenuous  and border skirmishes with the British were to continue for the next hundred years  The skirmishes eventually led to the Duar War  1864 65   a confrontation for control of the Bengal Duars  After Bhutan lost the war  the Treaty of Sinchula was signed between British India and Bhutan  As part of the war reparations  the Duars were ceded to the United Kingdom in exchange for a rent of Rs  50 000  The treaty ended all hostilities between British India and Bhutan  During the 1870s  power struggles between the rival valleys of Paro and Tongsa led to civil war in Bhutan  eventually leading to the ascendancy of Ugyen Wangchuck  the ponlop  governor  of Tongsa  From his power base in central Bhutan  Ugyen Wangchuck defeated his political enemies and united the country following several civil wars and rebellions during 1882 85  31  In 1907  an epochal year for the country  Ugyen Wangchuck was unanimously chosen as the hereditary king of the country by an assembly of leading Buddhist monks  government officials  and heads of important families  The British government promptly recognized the new monarchy  and in 1910 Bhutan signed the Treaty of Punakha  a subsidiary alliance which gave the British control of Bhutan s foreign affairs and meant that Bhutan was treated as an Indian princely state  This had little real effect  given Bhutan s historical reticence  and also did not appear to affect Bhutan s traditional relations with Tibet  After the new Union of India gained independence from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947  Bhutan became one of the first countries to recognize India s independence  On 8 August 1949  a treaty similar to that of 1910  in which Britain had gained power over Bhutan s foreign relations  was signed with the newly independent India  18  In 1953  King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck established the country s legislature   a 130 member National Assembly   to promote a more democratic form of governance  In 1965  he set up a Royal Advisory Council  and in 1968 he formed a Cabinet  In 1971  Bhutan was admitted to the United Nations  having held observer status for three years  In July 1972  Jigme Singye Wangchuck ascended to the throne at the age of sixteen after the death of his father  Dorji Wangchuck  In the late 1980s and early 1990s  the country expelled or forced to leave nearly one fifth of its population in the name of preserving its Tibetan Mahayana Buddhist culture and identity  32  The Lhotshampas  the ethnic group persecuted by the Bhutanese government  were subject to  harassment  arrests and the burning of ethnic Nepali homes   33  The government enacted discriminatory citizenship laws against the Lhotshampas  stripping about one fifth of its population of citizenship  A harassment campaign escalating in the early 1990s ensued  and afterwards Bhutanese security forces began expelling people after making them renounce claims to their homes and homeland  A refugee recounted   The army took all the people from their houses  As we left Bhutan  we were forced to sign the document  They snapped our photos  The man told me to smile  to show my teeth  He wanted to show that I was leaving my country willingly  happily  that I was not forced to leave   34  Due to the violence  Bhutanese of Nepali origin  mainly Hindu  fled their homeland  According to the UNHCR  more than 107 000 Bhutanese refugees living in seven camps in eastern Nepal have been documented as of 2008  35  After many years in refugee camps  many are now moving to host nations such as Norway  the United Kingdom  Australia  and the United States as refugees  The United States has admitted 30 870 refugees from fiscal years 2008 through 2010  36  Still  in July 2010  the Bhutanese prime minister  Jigme Y Thinley  called the Bhutanese refugees illegal immigrants  37   edit  Political reform and modernization Further information  Law of Bhutan and Constitution of Bhutan King Jigme Singye Wangchuck introduced significant political reforms  transferring most of his administrative powers to the Council of Cabinet Ministers and allowing for impeachment of the King by a two thirds majority of the National Assembly  38  In 1999  the government lifted a ban on television and the Internet  making Bhutan one of the last countries to introduce television  In his speech  the King said that television was a critical step to the modernisation of Bhutan as well as a major contributor to the country s Gross National Happiness  Bhutan is the only country to measure happiness   39  but warned that the  misuse  of television could erode traditional Bhutanese values  40  A new constitution was presented in early 2005  In December 2005  Jigme Singye Wangchuck announced that he would abdicate the throne in his son s favor in 2008  On 14 December 2006  he announced that he would be abdicating immediately  This was followed by the first national parliamentary elections in December 2007 and March 2008  On November 6  2008  28 year old Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck  eldest son of King Jigme Singye Wangchuck  was crowned King  41   edit  Government and politics Main

the Lhengye Zhungtshog  the council of ministers  Legislative power was vested in both the government and the former Grand National Assembly  On the 17th of December 2005  the 4th King  Jigme Singye Wangchuck  announced to a stunned nation that the first general elections would be held in 2008  and that he would abdicate the throne in favor of his eldest son  the crown prince  42  King Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuck took the throne on December 14  2006 upon his father s abdication  Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck was adorned with Bhutan s Raven Crown at an ornate coronation ceremony in Thimphu on Thursday  November 6  2008  becoming the world s youngest reigning monarch and head of the newest democracy  43  The new political system comprises an upper and lower house  the latter based on political party affiliations  Elections for the upper house  National Council  were held on December 31  2007  while elections for the lower house  the 47 seat National Assembly  were held on March 24  2008  Two political parties  the People s Democratic Party  PDP  headed by Sangay Ngedup  and the Druk Phuensum Tshogpa  DPT  headed by Jigmi Thinley  competed in the National Assembly

of about  13 7 million   1 8 percent of the GDP  Being a landlocked country  Bhutan has no navy  It also has no air force or army aviation corps  The Army relies on Eastern Air Command of the Indian Air Force for air assistance  In 2007  Bhutan and India signed a new treaty that clarified that Bhutan was master of its own foreign relations  superseding the treaty signed in 1949  The superseded treaty is still sometimes misinterpreted to mean that India controls Bhutan s foreign affairs  but the government of Bhutan handles all of its own foreign affairs  including the sensitive  to India  border demarcation issue with China  Bhutan has diplomatic relations with 21 countries  and with the European Union  with missions in India  Bangladesh  Thailand  and Kuwait  It has two UN missions  one in New York and one in Geneva  Only India and Bangladesh have residential embassies in Bhutan  while Thailand has a consulate office in Bhutan  By a long standing treaty  Indian and Bhutanese citizens may travel to each other s countries without a passport or visa using their national identity cards instead  Bhutanese citizens may also work in India without legal restriction  Bhutan does not have formal diplomatic ties with its northern neighbour  the People s Republic of China  although exchanges of visits at various levels between the two have significantly increased in recent times  The first bilateral agreement between China  PRC  and Bhutan was signed in 1998  and Bhutan has also set up honorary consulates in Macau and Hong Kong  Bhutan s border with China is largely not demarcated and thus disputed in some places  Approximately 269 square kilometers remain under discussion between China and Bhutan  46  On 13 November 2005  Chinese soldiers crossed into the disputed territories between China and Bhutan  and began building roads and bridges  47  Bhutanese Foreign Minister Khandu Wangchuk took up the matter with Chinese authorities after the issue was raised in the Bhutanese parliament  In response  Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang of the People s Republic of China has said that the border remains in dispute and that the two sides are continuing to work for a peaceful and cordial resolution of the dispute  48  An Indian intelligence officer has said that a Chinese delegation in Bhutan told the Bhutanese that they were  overreacting   The Bhutanese newspaper Kuensel has said that China might use the roads to further Chinese claims along the border  47  On 8 February 2007  the Indo Bhutan Friendship Treaty was substantially revised  The Treaty of 1949  Article 2 states   The Government of India undertakes to exercise no interference in the internal administration of Bhutan  On its part the Government of Bhutan agrees to be guided by the advice of the Government of India in regard to its external relations   In the revised treaty it now reads as  In keeping with the abiding ties of close friendship and cooperation between Bhutan and India  the Government of the Kingdom of Bhutan and the Government of the Republic of India shall cooperate closely with each other on issues relating to their national interests  Neither government shall allow the use of its territory for activities harmful to the national security and interest of the other   The revised treaty also includes this preamble   Reaffirming their respect for each other s independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity   an element that was absent in the earlier version  The Indo Bhutan Friendship Treaty of 2007 clarifies Bhutan s status as an independent and sovereign nation  Bhutan maintains formal diplomatic relations with several Asian and European nations  Canada  and Brazil  Other countries  such as the United States and the United Kingdom  have no

landlocked between the Tibet Autonomous Region to the north and the Indian states of Sikkim  West Bengal  Assam and Arunachal Pradesh to the west and south  It lies between latitudes 26  and 29 N  and longitudes 88  and 93 E  The land consists mostly of steep and high mountains crisscrossed by a network of swift rivers  which form deep valleys before draining into the Indian plains  Elevation rises from 200 m  660 ft  in the southern foothills to more than 7 000 m  23 000 ft   This great geographical diversity combined with equally diverse climate conditions contributes to Bhutan s outstanding range of biodiversity and ecosystems  2  The northern region of the country consists of an arc of Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows reaching up to glaciated mountain peaks with an extremely cold climate at the highest elevations  Most peaks in the north are over 7 000 m  23 000 ft  above sea level  the highest point in Bhutan is Gangkhar Puensum at 7 570 metres  24 840 ft   which has the distinction of being the highest unclimbed mountain in the world  3  The lowest point  at 98 m  322 ft   is in the valley of Drangme Chhu  where the river crosses the border with India  3  Watered by snow fed rivers  alpine valleys in this region provide pasture for livestock  tended by a sparse population of migratory shepherds  The Black Mountains in the central region of Bhutan form a watershed between two major river systems  the Mo Chhu and the Drangme Chhu  Peaks in the Black Mountains range between 1 500 and 2 700 m  4 900 and 8 900 ft  above sea level  and fast flowing rivers have carved out deep gorges in the lower mountain areas  The forests of the central Bhutan mountains consist of Eastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests in higher elevations and Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests in lower elevations  Woodlands of the central region provide most of Bhutan s forest production  The Torsa  Raidak  Sankosh  and Manas are the main rivers of Bhutan  flowing through this region  Most of the population lives in the central highlands  In the south  the Shiwalik Hills are covered with dense Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests  alluvial lowland river valleys  and mountains up to around 1 500 m  4 900 ft  above sea level  The foothills descend into the subtropical Duars Plain  Most of the Duars is located in India  although a 10 to 15 km  6 2 to 9 3 mi  wide strip extends into Bhutan  The Bhutan Duars is divided into two parts  the northern and the southern Duars  The northern Duars  which abuts the Himalayan foothills  has rugged  sloping terrain and dry  porous soil with dense vegetation and abundant wildlife  The southern Duars has moderately fertile soil  heavy savannah grass  dense  mixed jungle  and freshwater springs  Mountain rivers  fed by either the melting snow or the monsoon rains  empty into the Brahmaputra River in India  Data released by the Ministry of Agriculture showed that the country had a forest cover of 64  as of October 2005   edit  Climate Jacaranda trees in Bhutan The climate in Bhutan varies with elevation  from subtropical in the south to temperate in the highlands and polar type climate  with year round snow in

outstanding ecoregions of the world in a comprehensive analysis of global biodiversity undertaken by WWF between 1995 and 1997  Bhutan is seen as a model for proactive conservation initiatives  The Kingdom has received international acclaim for its commitment to the maintenance of its biodiversity  This is reflected in the decision to maintain at least sixty percent of the land area under forest cover  to designate more than 40  57  58  of its territory as national parks  reserves and other protected areas  and most recently to identify a further nine percent of land area as biodiversity corridors linking the protected areas  Environmental conservation has been placed at the core of the nation s development strategy  the middle path  It is not treated as a sector but rather as a set of concerns that must be mainstreamed in Bhutan s overall approach to development planning and to be buttressed by the force of law   edit  Conservation issues Further information  Environmental issues in Bhutan The most endangered Asia top predator of 2010  the dhole is on the edge of extinction  Fewer than 2500 members of the species remain in the world  Although Bhutan s natural heritage is still largely intact  the Government has said that it cannot be taken for granted and that conservation of the natural environment must be considered one of the challenges that will need to be addressed in the years ahead  Pressures on the natural environment are already evident and will be fuelled by a complex array of forces  They include population pressures  agricultural modernisation  poaching  hydro power development  mineral extraction  industrialisation  urbanisation  sewage and waste disposal  tourism  competition for available land road construction and the provision of other physical infrastructure associated with social and economic development  Policy implementation needs to be continually improved  Sustainable rural livelihoods that do not rely solely upon natural resource use need to be developed and supported  and there needs to be far wider understanding of the environmental threats that come hand in hand with development  to ensure the future of Bhutan s rich and diverse environment  In practice  the overlap of these extensive protected lands with populated areas has led to mutual habitat encroachment  Protected wildlife has entered agricultural areas  trampling crops and killing livestock  In response  Bhutan has implemented an insurance scheme  begun constructing solar powered alarm fences  watch towers  and search lights  and has provided fodder and salt licks outside human settlement areas to encourage animals to stay away  59   edit  Economy Main article  Economy of Bhutan The ngultrum is the currency of Bhutan The ngultrum is the currency

years  by eight percent in 2005 and 14 percent in 2006  In 2007  Bhutan had the second fastest growing economy in the world  with an annual economic growth rate of 22 4 percent  This was mainly due to the commissioning of the gigantic Tala Hydroelectricity project  As of March 2006  Bhutan s per capita income was US 1 321  Bhutan s economy is based on agriculture  forestry  tourism and the sale of hydroelectric power to India  Agriculture provides the main livelihood for more than 80 percent of the population  Agrarian practices consist largely of subsistence farming and animal husbandry  Handicrafts  particularly weaving and the manufacture of religious art for home altars  are a small cottage industry  A landscape that varies from hilly to ruggedly mountainous has made the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive  This  and a lack of access to the sea  has meant that Bhutan has not been able to benefit from significant trading of its produce  Bhutan does not have any railways  though Indian Railways plans to link southern Bhutan to its vast network under an agreement signed in January 2005  60  Bhutan and India signed a  free trade  accord in 2008  which additionally allowed Bhutanese imports and exports from third markets to transit India without tariffs  61  Bhutan had trade relations with the Tibet region until 1960  when it closed its border with China after an influx of refugees  62  The industrial sector is in a nascent stage  and though most production comes from cottage industry  larger industries are being encouraged and some industries such as cement  steel  and ferroalloy have been set up  Most development projects  such as road construction  rely on Indian contract labour  Agricultural produce includes rice  chilies  dairy  some yak  mostly cow  products  buckwheat  barley  root crops  apples  and citrus and maize at lower elevations  Industries include cement  wood products  processed fruits  alcoholic beverages and calcium carbide  Incomes of over Nu 100 000 per annum are taxed  but very few wage and salary earners qualify  Bhutan s inflation rate was estimated at about three percent in 2003  Bhutan has a

Eastern Bhutanese respectively  The Lhotshampa  meaning  southerners   are a heterogeneous group of mostly Nepalese descent  The Ngalops primarily consist of Bhutanese living in the western part of the country  Their culture is closely related to that of Tibet  Much the same could be said of the Sharchops  the dominant group  who traditionally follow the Nyingmapa rather than the official Drukpa Kagyu form of Tibetan Buddhism  In modern times  with improved transportation infrastructure  there has been much intermarriage between these groups  In the early 1970s  intermarriage between the Lhotshampas and mainstream Bhutanese society was encouraged by the government  but after the late 1980s  the Bhutanese government forced about 108 000 Lhotshampas from their homes  seized their land  and expelled them to refugee camps  33  The literacy rate in Bhutan is 59 5 percent  66  The country has a median age of 22 3 years  67  Bhutan has a life expectancy of 62 2 years  61 for males and 64

that between two thirds and three quarters of the Bhutanese population follow Vajrayana Buddhism  which is also the state religion  About one quarter to one third are followers of Hinduism  Other religions account for less than 1  of the population  68  The current legal framework  in principle guarantees freedom of religion  proselytism  however  is forbidden by a royal government decision 68  and by judicial interpretation of the Constitution  69  Buddhism was introduced to Bhutan in the 7th century AD  Tibetan king Songts n Gampo  reigned 627 49   a convert to Buddhism  ordered the construction of two Buddhist temples  at Bumthang in central Bhutan and at Kyichu  near Paro  in the Paro Valley  21   edit  Languages Main article  Languages of Bhutan Dzongkha Bumthang Kurt p Dzala

is Bhutanese  or Dzongkha  one of 53 languages in the Tibetan language family  The script  here called Chhokey   Dharma Language    is identical to classical Tibetan  In the schools English is the medium of instruction and Dzongkha is taught as the national language  Ethnologue lists 24 languages currently spoken in Bhutan  all of them in the Tibeto Burman family  except Nepali  an Indo Aryan language  Until the 1980s  the government sponsored the teaching of Nepali in schools in Southern Bhutan  However  after the armed uprising in the south  Nepali was dropped from the curriculum  The languages of Bhutan are still not well characterized  and several have yet to be recorded in an in depth academic grammar  Before the 1980s  the Lhotshampa  Nepali speaking community   mainly based in southern Bhutan  constituted approximately 30  of the population  70  However  during the 1980s  after the Bhutanese government instituted a policy of one language and one culture  these Lhotshampas were forced to wear the national costume of Bhutan  which is not well suited to the high temperatures of the southern region  70  This cultural discrimination led to protests which eventually resulted in the eviction of more than 100 000 Lhotshampas throughout the 1990s  35  These Lhotshampas took refuge in Nepal via India  Because the bilateral talks between Nepal and Bhutan to repatriate Bhutanese refugees  Lhotshampas  have been proven futile  the UNHCR is now helping the refugees to settle in various developed countries such as Norway  USA  Canada and many others  32  35  Dzongkha is partially intelligible with Sikkimese and spoken natively by 25  of the population  Tshangla  the language of the Sharchop and the principal pre Tibetan language of Bhutan  is spoken by a greater number of people  It is not easily classified and may constitute an independent branch of Tibeto Burman  Nepali speakers constituted some 40  of the population as of 2006  The larger minority languages are Dzala  11    Limbu  10   immigrant   and Kheng  8    There are no reliable sources for the ethnic or linguistic composition of Bhutan  so these numbers do not add up to 100    edit  Culture Main article  Culture of Bhutan Bhutanese thanka of Mt  Meru and the Buddhist Universe  19th century  Tongsa Dzong  Tongsa  Bhutan  Chaam  sacred masked dances  are annually performed during religious festivals  Bhutan has a rich and unique cultural heritage that has largely remained intact because of its isolation from the rest of the world until the early 1960s  One of the main attractions for tourists is the country s culture and traditions  Bhutanese tradition is deeply steeped in its Buddhist heritage  71  72 Hinduism is the second dominant religion in Bhutan  being most prevalent in the southern regions  73  The government is increasingly making efforts to preserve and sustain the current culture and traditions of the country  Because of its largely unspoiled natural environment and cultural heritage  Bhutan has been referred to as The Last Shangri la  74  While Bhutanese citizens are free to travel abroad  Bhutan is viewed as inaccessible by many foreigners  Another reason for it being an unpopular destination is the cost  which is high for tourists on tighter budgets  Entry is free for citizens of India and Bangladesh  but all other foreigners are required to sign up with a Bhutanese tour operator and pay around US 200 per day that they stay in the country  75  The national dress for Bhutanese men is the gho  a knee length robe tied at the waist by a cloth belt known as the kera  Women wear an ankle length dress  the kira  which is clipped at one shoulder and tied at the waist  An accompaniment to the kira is a long sleeved blouse  the toego  which is worn underneath the outer layer  Social status and class determine the texture  colours  and decorations that embellish the garments  Differently coloured scarves and shawls are important indicators of social standing  as Bhutan has traditionally been a feudal society  Jewellery is mostly worn by women  especially during religious festivals  tsechus  and public gatherings  To strengthen Bhutan s identity as an independent country  Bhutanese law requires all Bhutanese citizens to wear the national dress in public areas and as formal wear  Rice  buckwheat  and increasingly maize  are the staples of Bhutanese cuisine  The local diet also includes pork  beef  yak meat  chicken  and mutton  Soups and stews of meat and dried vegetables spiced with chillies and cheese are prepared  Ema datshi  made very spicy with cheese and chilies  might be called the national dish for its ubiquity and the pride that Bhutanese have for it  Dairy foods  particularly butter and cheese from yaks and cows  are also popular  and indeed almost all milk is turned to butter and cheese  Popular beverages include butter tea  tea  locally brewed ara  rice wine  and beer  Bhutan is the first country in the world to have banned the sale of tobacco under its Tobacco Act of 2010  28  Bhutanese architecture remains distinctively traditional  employing rammed earth and wattle and daub construction methods  stone masonry  and intricate woodwork around windows and roofs  Traditional architecture uses no nails or iron bars in construction  28  76  77  Characteristic of the region is a type of castle fortress known as the dzong  Since ancient times  the dzongs have served as the religious and secular administration centres for their respective districts  78  The University of Texas at El Paso in the United States has adopted Bhutanese architecture for its buildings on campus  as have the nearby Hilton Garden Inn and other buildings in the city of El Paso  79  Bhutan has numerous public holidays  most of which centre around traditional seasonal  secular and religious festivals  They include the winter solstice  around January 1  depending on the lunar calendar   the lunar New Year  February or March   the King s birthday and the anniversary of his coronation  the official start of monsoon season  September 22   National Day  December 17   and various Buddhist and Hindu celebrations  Masked dances and dance dramas are common traditional features at festivals  usually accompanied by traditional music  Energetic dancers  wearing colourful wooden or composition face masks and stylized costumes  depict heroes  demons  d mons  death heads  animals  gods  and caricatures of common people  The dancers enjoy royal patronage  and preserve ancient folk and religious customs and perpetuate the ancient lore and art of mask making  The music of Bhutan can generally be divided into traditional and modern varieties  traditional music comprises religious and folk genres  the latter including zhungdra and boedra  80  The modern rigsar is played on a mix of traditional instruments and electronic keyboards  and dates back to the early 1990s  it shows the influence of Indian popular music  a hybrid form of traditional and Western popular influences  81  82  In Bhutanese families  inheritance generally passes through the female rather than the male line  Daughters will inherit their parents  house  A man is expected to make his own way in the world and often moves to his wife s home  Love marriages are common in urban areas  but the tradition of arranged marriages is still common in the villages  Although uncommon  polygamy is accepted  often being a device to keep property in a contained family unit rather than dispersing it  83  The previous king  Jigme Singye Wangchuck  who abdicated in 2006  had four queens  all of whom are sisters  The current king  Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck  wed Jetsun Pema  21  a commoner and daughter of a pilot  on 13 October 2011   edit  Sports Changlimithang Stadium  during a parade  Bhutan s national sport is archery  and competitions are held regularly in most villages  It differs from Olympic standards in technical details such as the placement of the targets and atmosphere  There are two targets placed over 100 meters apart and teams shoot from one end of the field to the other  Each member of the team shoots two arrows per round  Traditional Bhutanese archery is a social event and competitions are organized between villages  towns  and amateur teams  There are usually plenty of food and drink complete with singing and dancing  Attempts to distract an opponent include standing around the target and making fun of the shooter s ability  Darts  khuru  is an equally popular outdoor team sport  in which heavy wooden darts pointed with a 10 cm nail are thrown at a paperback sized target 10 to 20 meters away  Another traditional sport is the Digor  which resembles the shot put and horseshoe throwing  Cricket has gained popularity in Bhutan  particularly since the introduction of television channels from India  The Bhutan national cricket team is one of the more successful affiliate nations in the region  Football is also an increasingly popular sport  In 2002  Bhutan s national football team played Montserrat  in what was billed as The Other Final  the match took place on the same day Brazil played Germany in the World Cup final  but at the time Bhutan and Montserrat were the world s two lowest ranked teams  The match was held in Thimphu s Changlimithang National Stadium  and Bhutan won 4 0  A documentary of the match was made by the Dutch filmmaker Johan Kramer   edit  Traffic and transport Main article  Transport in Bhutan Paro Airport is the only international airport in Bhutan  Yongphulla Airport in Trashigang is a small domestic airport that underwent upgrades through 2010  84  Yongphulla Airport was scheduled for completion in January 2010  but as of August 2011 work is still ongoing  85  There are plans for further domestic airports to be built at Bathpalathang in Bumthang District and at Gelephu in Sarpang District  which were due to start operations in June 2011  86  The Lateral Road is Bhutan s primary east west corridor  connecting Phuentsholing in the southwest to Trashigang in the east  In between  the Lateral Road runs directly through Wangdue Phodrang  Trongsa  and other population centers  The Lateral Road also has spurs connecting to the capital Thimphu and other major population centers such as Paro and Punakha  As with other roads in Bhutan  the Lateral Road presents serious safety concerns due to pavement conditions  sheer drops  hairpin turns  weather  and landslides  87  88  89   edit  See also Geography
