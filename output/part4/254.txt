and since then has appeared primarily in publications by DC Comics  Originally referred to as  The Bat Man  and still referred to at times as  The Batman   he is additionally known as  The Caped Crusader   2   The Dark Knight   2  and  The World s Greatest Detective   2  among other titles  In the original version of the story and the vast majority of retellings  Batman s secret identity is Bruce Wayne  an American millionaire  later billionaire  playboy  industrialist  and philanthropist  Having witnessed the murder of his parents as a child  he swore revenge on criminals  an oath tempered with the greater ideal of justice  Wayne trains himself both physically and intellectually and dons a bat themed costume in order to fight crime  3  Batman operates in the fictional American Gotham City  assisted by various supporting characters including his crime fighting partner  Robin  his butler Alfred Pennyworth  the police commissioner Jim Gordon  and occasionally the heroine Batgirl  He fights an assortment of villains such as the Joker  the Penguin  the Riddler  Two Face  Poison Ivy and Catwoman  Unlike most superheroes  he does not possess any superpowers  he makes use of intellect  detective skills  science and technology  wealth  physical prowess  martial arts skills  an indomitable will  fear  and intimidation in his continuous war on crime  Batman became a very popular character soon after his introduction and gained his own comic book title  Batman  in 1940  As the decades wore on  differing interpretations of the character emerged  The late 1960s Batman television series used a camp aesthetic which continued to be associated with the character for years after the show ended  Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots  culminating in the 1986 miniseries The Dark Knight Returns  by Frank Miller  while the successes of Tim Burton s 1989 film Batman and Christopher Nolan s 2005 reboot Batman Begins also helped to reignite popular interest in the character  4  A cultural icon  Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media  from radio to television and film  and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world such as toys and video games  The character has also intrigued psychiatrists with many trying to understand the character s psyche and his true ego in society  In May 2011  Batman placed second on IGN s Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time  after Superman  Empire magazine also listed him second in their 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters of All Time  5  Contents 1

of Batman comics Creation In early 1939  the success of Superman in Action Comics prompted editors at the comic book division of National Publications  the future DC Comics  to request more superheroes for its titles  In response  Bob Kane created  the Bat Man   6  Collaborator Bill Finger recalled  Kane had an idea for a character called  Batman   and he d like me to see the drawings  I went over to Kane s  and he had drawn a character who looked very much like Superman with kind of     reddish tights  I believe  with boots     no gloves  no gauntlets     with a small domino mask  swinging on a rope  He had two stiff wings that were sticking out  looking like bat wings  And under it was a big sign     BATMAN   7  Finger offered such suggestions as giving the character a cowl instead of a simple domino mask  a cape instead of wings  and gloves  and removing the red sections from the original costume  8  9  10  11  Finger said he devised the name Bruce Wayne for the character s secret identity   Bruce Wayne s first name came from Robert Bruce  the Scottish patriot  Bruce  being a playboy  was a man of gentry  I searched for a name that would suggest colonialism  I tried Adams  Hancock     then I thought of Mad Anthony Wayne   12  He later said his suggestions were influenced by Lee Falk s popular The Phantom  a syndicated newspaper comic strip character with which Kane was familiar as well  13  Various aspects of Batman s personality  character history  visual design  and equipment were inspired by contemporary popular culture of the 1930s  including movies  pulp magazines  comic strips  newspaper headlines  and even aspects of Kane himself  14  Kane noted especially the influence of the films The Mark of Zorro  1920  and The Bat Whispers  1930  in the creation of the iconography associated with the character  while Finger drew inspiration from literary characters Doc Savage  The Shadow  and Sherlock Holmes in his depiction of Batman as a master sleuth and scientist  15  Kane  in his 1989 autobiography  detailed Finger s contributions to Batman s creation  One day I called Bill and said   I have a new character called the Bat Man and I ve made some crude  elementary sketches I d like you to look at   He came over and I showed him the drawings  At the time  I only had a small domino mask  like the one Robin later wore  on Batman s face  Bill said   Why not make him look more like a bat and put a hood on him  and take the eyeballs out and just put slits for eyes to make him look more mysterious   At this point  the Bat Man wore a red union suit  the wings  trunks  and mask were black  I thought that red and black would be a good combination  Bill said that the costume was too bright   Color it dark gray to make it look more ominous   The cape looked like two stiff bat wings attached to his arms  As Bill and I talked  we realized that these wings would get cumbersome when Bat Man was in action  and changed them into a cape  scalloped to look like bat wings when he was fighting or swinging down on a rope  Also  he didn t have any gloves on  and we added them so that he wouldn t leave fingerprints  13  Kane signed away ownership in the character in exchange for  among other compensation  a mandatory byline on all Batman comics  This byline did not  originally say  Batman created by Bob Kane   his name was simply written on the title page of each story  The name disappeared from the comic book in the mid 1960s  replaced by credits for each story s actual writer and artists  In the late 1970s  when Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster began receiving a  created by  credit on the Superman titles  along with William Moulton Marston being given the byline for creating Wonder Woman  Batman stories began saying  Created by Bob Kane  in addition to the other credits  Finger did not receive the same recognition  While he had received credit for other DC work since the 1940s  he began  in the 1960s  to receive limited acknowledgment for his Batman writing  in the letters page of Batman  169  February 1965  for example  editor Julius Schwartz names him as the creator of the Riddler  one of Batman s recurring villains  However  Finger s contract left him only with his writing page rate and no byline  Kane wrote   Bill was disheartened by the lack of major accomplishments in his career  He felt that he had not used his creative potential to its fullest and that success had passed him by   12  At the time of Finger s death in 1974  DC had not officially credited Finger as Batman co creator  Jerry Robinson  who also worked with Finger and Kane on the strip at this time  has criticized Kane for failing to share the credit  He recalled Finger resenting his position  stating in a 2005 interview with The Comics Journal  Bob made him more insecure  because while he slaved working on Batman  he wasn t sharing in any of the glory or the money that Bob began to make  which is why     he was  going to leave  Kane s employ        Kane  should have credited Bill as co creator  because I know  I was there      That was one thing I would never forgive Bob for  was not to take care of Bill or recognize his vital role in the creation of Batman  As with Siegel and Shuster  it should have been the same  the same co creator credit in the strip  writer and artist  16  Although Kane initially rebutted Finger s claims at having created the character  writing in a 1965 open letter to fans that  it seemed to me that Bill Finger has given out the impression that he and not myself created the   Batman  t   sic  as well as Robin and all the other leading villains and characters  This statement is fraudulent and entirely untrue   Kane himself also commented on Finger s lack of credit   The trouble with being a  ghost  writer or artist is that you must remain rather anonymously without  credit   However  if one wants the  credit   then one has to cease being a  ghost  or follower and become a leader or innovator   17  In 1989  Kane revisited Finger s situation  recalling in an interview  In those days it was like  one artist and he had his name over it  the comic strip    the policy of DC in the comic books was  if you can t write it  obtain other writers  but their names would never appear on the comic book in the finished version  So Bill never asked me for it  the byline  and I never volunteered   I guess my ego at that time  And I felt badly  really  when he  Finger  died  18  Early years Batman made his debut in Detective Comics  27  May 1939   Cover art by Bob Kane The first Batman story   The Case of the Chemical Syndicate   was published in Detective Comics  27  May 1939   Finger said   Batman was originally written in the style of the pulps   19  and this influence was evident with Batman showing little remorse over killing or maiming criminals  Batman proved a hit character  and he received his own solo title in 1940  while continuing to star in Detective Comics  By that time  National was the top selling and most influential publisher in the industry  Batman and the company s other major hero  Superman  were the cornerstones of the company s success  20  The two characters were featured side by side as the stars of World s Finest Comics  which was originally titled World s Best Comics when it debuted in fall 1940  Creators including Jerry Robinson and Dick Sprang also worked on the strips during this period  Over the course of the first few Batman strips elements were added to the character and the artistic depiction of Batman evolved  Kane noted that within six issues he drew the character s jawline more pronounced  and lengthened the ears on the costume   About a year later he was almost the full figure  my mature Batman   Kane said  21 Batman s characteristic utility belt was introduced in Detective Comics  29  July 1939   followed by the boomerang like batarang and the first bat themed vehicle  the Batplane  in  31  September 1939   The character s origin was revealed in  33  November 1939   unfolding in a two page story that establishes the brooding persona of Batman  a character driven by the death of his parents  Written by Finger  it depicts a young Bruce Wayne witnessing his parents  murder at the hands of a mugger  Days later  at their grave  the child vows that  by the spirits of my parents  I will  avenge their deaths by spending the rest of my life warring on all criminals   22  23  24  The early  pulp inflected portrayal of Batman started to soften in Detective Comics  38  April 1940  with the introduction of Robin  Batman s kid sidekick  25  Robin was introduced  based on Finger s suggestion Batman needed a  Watson  with whom Batman could talk  26  Sales nearly doubled  despite Kane s preference for a solo Batman  and it sparked a proliferation of  kid sidekicks   27  The first issue of the solo spin off series Batman was notable not only for introducing two of his most persistent antagonists  the Joker and Catwoman  but for a story in which Batman shoots some monstrous giants to death  That story prompted editor Whitney Ellsworth to decree that the character could no longer kill or use a gun  28  By 1942  the writers and artists behind the Batman comics had established most of the basic elements of the Batman mythos  29  In the years following World War II  DC Comics  adopted a postwar editorial direction that increasingly de emphasized social commentary in favor of lighthearted juvenile fantasy   The impact of this editorial approach was evident in Batman comics of the postwar period  removed from the  bleak and menacing world  of the strips of the early 1940s  Batman was instead portrayed as a respectable citizen and paternal figure that inhabited a  bright and colorful  environment  30  1950s and early 1960s Batman was one of the few superhero characters to be continuously published as interest in the genre waned during the 1950s  In the story  The Mightiest Team in the World  in Superman  76  June 1952   Batman teams up with Superman for the first time and the pair discovers each other s secret identity  31  Following the success of this story  World s Finest Comics was revamped so it featured stories starring both heroes together  instead of the separate Batman and Superman features that had been running before  32  The team up of the characters was  a financial success in an era when those were few and far between   33  this series of stories ran until the book s cancellation in 1986  Batman comics were among those criticized when the comic book industry came under scrutiny with the publication of psychologist Fredric Wertham s book Seduction of the Innocent in 1954  Wertham s thesis was that children imitated crimes committed in comic books  and that these works corrupt the morals of the youth  Wertham criticized Batman comics for their supposed homosexual overtones and argued that Batman and Robin were portrayed as lovers  34  Wertham s criticisms raised a public outcry during the 1950s  eventually leading to the establishment of the Comics Code Authority  The tendency towards a  sunnier Batman  in the postwar years intensified after the introduction of the Comics Code  35  It has also been suggested by scholars that the characters of Batwoman  in 1956  and the pre Barbara Gordon Bat Girl  in 1961  were introduced in part to refute the allegation that Batman and Robin were gay  and the stories took on a campier  lighter feel  36  In the late 1950s  Batman stories gradually became more science fiction oriented  an attempt at mimicking the success of other DC characters that had dabbled in the genre  37  New characters such as Batwoman  Ace the Bat Hound  and Bat Mite were introduced  Batman s adventures often involved odd transformations or bizarre space aliens  In 1960  Batman debuted as a member of the Justice League of America in The Brave and the Bold  28  February 1960   and went on to appear in several Justice League comic series starting later that same year   New Look  Batman and camp By 1964  sales on Batman titles had fallen drastically  Bob Kane noted that  as a result  DC was  planning to kill Batman off altogether   38  In response to this  editor Julius Schwartz was assigned to the Batman titles  He presided over drastic changes  beginning with 1964 s Detective Comics  327  May 1964   which was cover billed as the  New Look   Schwartz introduced changes designed to make Batman more contemporary  and to return him to more detective oriented stories  He brought in artist Carmine Infantino to help overhaul the character  The Batmobile was redesigned  and Batman s costume was modified to incorporate a yellow ellipse behind the bat insignia  The space aliens and characters of the 1950s such as Batwoman  Ace  and Bat Mite were retired  Batman s butler Alfred was killed off  though his death was quickly reversed due to fan response  while a new female relative for the Wayne family  Aunt Harriet  came to live with Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson  39  The debut of the Batman television series in 1966 had a profound influence on the character  The success of the series increased sales throughout the comic book industry  and Batman reached a circulation of close to 900 000 copies  40  Elements such as the character of Batgirl and the show s campy nature were introduced into the comics  the series also initiated the return of Alfred  Although both the comics and TV show were successful for a time  the camp approach eventually wore thin and the show was canceled in 1968  In the aftermath  the Batman comics themselves lost popularity once again  As Julius Schwartz noted   When the television show was a success  I was asked to be campy  and of course when the show faded  so did the comic books   41  Starting in 1969  writer Dennis O Neil and artist Neal Adams made a deliberate effort to distance Batman from the campy portrayal of the 1960s TV series and to return the character to his roots as a  grim avenger of the night   42  O Neil said his idea was  simply to take it back to where it started  I went to the DC library and read some of the early stories  I tried to get a sense of what Kane and Finger were after   43  O Neil and Adams first collaborated on the story  The Secret of the Waiting Graves   Detective Comics  395  January 1970   Few stories were true collaborations between O Neil  Adams  Schwartz  and inker Dick Giordano  and in actuality these men were mixed and matched with various other creators during the 1970s  nevertheless the influence of their work was  tremendous   44  Giordano said   We went back to a grimmer  darker Batman  and I think that s why these stories did so well    Even today we re still using Neal s Batman with the long flowing cape and the pointy ears   45  While the work of O Neil and Adams was popular with fans  the acclaim did little to help declining sales  the same held true with a similarly acclaimed run by writer Steve Englehart and penciler Marshall Rogers in Detective Comics  471 476  August 1977   April 1978   which went on to influence the 1989 movie Batman and be adapted for Batman  The Animated Series  which debuted in 1992  46  Regardless  circulation continued to drop through the 1970s and 1980s  hitting an all time low in 1985  47  The Dark Knight Returns and later See also  Alternative versions of Batman Frank Miller s limited series The Dark Knight Returns  February June 1986   which tells the story of a 55 year old Batman coming out of retirement in a possible future  reinvigorated the character  The Dark Knight Returns was a financial success and has since become one of the medium s most noted touchstones  48  The series also sparked a major resurgence in the character s popularity  49  That year Dennis O Neil took over as editor of the Batman titles and set the template for the portrayal of Batman following DC s status quo altering miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths  O Neil operated under the assumption that he was hired to revamp the character and as a result tried to instill a different tone in the books than had gone before  50  One outcome of this new approach was the  Year One  storyline in Batman  404 407  February May 1987   in which Frank Miller and artist David Mazzucchelli redefined the character s origins  Writer Alan Moore and artist Brian Bolland continued this dark trend with 1988 s 48 page one shot Batman  The Killing Joke  in which the Joker  attempting to drive Commissioner Gordon insane  cripples Gordon s daughter Barbara  and then kidnaps and tortures the commissioner  physically and psychologically  The first issue of The Dark Knight Returns  which redefined Batman in the 1980s  Cover art by Frank Miller  The Batman comics garnered major attention in 1988 when DC Comics created a 900 number for readers to call to vote on whether Jason Todd  the second Robin  lived or died  Voters decided in favor of Jason s death by a narrow margin of 28 votes  see Batman  A Death in the Family   51  The following year saw the release of Tim Burton s Batman feature film  which firmly brought the character back to the public s attention  grossing millions of dollars at the box office  and millions more in merchandising  However  the three sequels  Tim Burton s Batman Returns and director Joel Schumacher s Batman Forever and Batman  amp  Robin  did not perform as well at the box office  The Batman movie franchise was rebooted with director and co writer Christopher Nolan s Batman Begins in 2005 and The Dark Knight in 2008  In 1989  the first issue of Legends of the Dark Knight  the first new solo Batman title in nearly fifty years  sold close to a million copies  52  The 1993  Knightfall  story arc introduced a new villain  Bane  who critically injures Bruce Wayne  Jean Paul Valley  known as Azrael  is called upon to wear the Batsuit during Wayne s convalescence  Writers Doug Moench  Chuck Dixon  and Alan Grant worked on the Batman titles during  Knightfall   and would also contribute to other Batman crossovers throughout the 1990s  1998 s  Cataclysm  storyline served as the precursor to 1999 s  No Man s Land   a year long storyline that ran through all the Batman related titles dealing with the effects of an earthquake ravaged Gotham City  At the conclusion of  No Man s Land   O Neil stepped down as editor and was replaced by Bob Schreck  Another writer who rose to prominence on the Batman comic series  was Jeph Loeb  Along with longtime collaborator Tim Sale  they wrote two miniseries   The Long Halloween  and  Dark Victory   that pit an early in his career version of Batman against his entire rogue s gallery  most notably Two Face  whose origin was re envisioned by Loeb  while dealing with various mysteries involving serial killers Holiday and the Hangman  of which the former was the subject of intense debate and speculation amongst Batman fans  In 2003  Loeb teamed with artist Jim Lee to work on another mystery arc   Batman  Hush  for the main Batman book  The twelve issue storyline saw Batman and Catwoman running the gauntlet against Batman s entire rogue s gallery  including an apparently resurrected Jason Todd  while seeking to find the identity of the mysterious supervillain Hush  While the character of Hush failed to catch on with readers  the arc was a sales success for DC  As the storyline was Jim Lee s first regular comic book work in nearly a decade  the series became  1 on the Diamond Comic Distributors sales chart for the first time since Batman  500  October 1993  and Jason Todd s appearance laid the groundwork for writer Judd Winick s subsequent run as writer on Batman  with another multi issue epic   Under the Hood   which ran from Batman  637 650  In 2005  DC launched All Star Batman and Robin  a stand alone comic series set outside the existing DC Universe  Written by Frank Miller and drawn by Jim Lee  the series was a commercial success for DC Comics 53  54  though widely panned by critics for its writing  55  56  Starting in 2006  the regular writers on Batman and Detective Comics were Grant Morrison and Paul Dini  with Grant Morrison reincorporating controversial elements of Batman lore  most notably  the science fiction themed storylines of the 1950s Batman comics  which Morrison revised as hallucinations Batman suffered under the influence of various mind bending gases and extensive sensory deprivation training  into the character  Morrison s run climaxed with  Batman R I P    which brought Batman up against the villainous  Black Glove  organization  which sought to drive Batman into madness   Batman R I P   segued into Final Crisis  also written by Morrison   which saw the apparent death of Batman at the hands of Darkseid  In the 2009 miniseries Batman  Battle for the Cowl  Wayne s former prot g  Dick Grayson becomes the new Batman  and Wayne s son Damian becomes the new Robin  57  58  In June 2009  Judd Winick returned to writing Batman  while Grant Morrison was given his own series  titled Batman and Robin  59  In 2010  the storyline Batman  The Return of Bruce Wayne saw Bruce travel through history  eventually returning to the present day  Although he reclaimed the mantle of Batman  he also allowed Grayson to continue being Batman as well  Bruce decided to take his war on crime globally  which is the central focus of Batman Incorporated  DC Comics would later announce that Grayson would be the main character in Batman  Detective Comics and Batman and Robin  while Wayne would be the main character in Batman Incorporated  Also  Bruce appeared in another ongoing series  Batman  The Dark Knight  2011 The New 52 relaunch Writer Scott Snyder signing Batman  1  November 2011  at a September 21  2011 appearance at Midtown Comics in Manhattan  as part of The New 52 promotion  In September 2011  DC Comics  entire line of superhero books  including its Batman franchise  was canceled and relaunched with new  1 issues as part of The New 52 reboot  Bruce Wayne is the only character to be identified as Batman and will be featured in Batman  Detective Comics  Batman and Robin  and Batman  The Dark Knight  Dick Grayson returns to the mantle of Nightwing and appears in his own ongoing series  While many characters have their histories significantly altered to attract newer  younger readers  Batman s history remains mostly intact  Batman Incorporated will be relaunched in 2012 to complete the  Leviathan  storyline  Fictional character biography Batman s history has undergone various revisions  both minor and major  Few elements of the character s history have remained constant  Scholars William Uricchio and Roberta E  Pearson noted in the early 1990s   Unlike some fictional characters  the Batman has no primary urtext set in a specific period  but has rather existed in a plethora of equally valid texts constantly appearing over more than five decades   60  The central fixed event in the Batman stories is the character s origin story  61  As a little boy  Bruce Wayne is horrified and traumatized to see his parents  the physician Dr  Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha  being murdered by a mugger in front of his very eyes  This drives him to fight crime in Gotham City as Batman  Pearson and Uricchio also noted beyond the origin story and such events as the introduction of Robin   Until recently  the fixed and accruing and hence  canonized  events have been few in number   61  a situation altered by an increased effort by later Batman editors such as Dennis O Neil to ensure consistency and continuity between stories  62  Golden Age See also  Batman  Earth Two  In Batman s first appearance in Detective Comics  27  he is already operating as a crime fighter  63  Batman s origin is first presented in Detective Comics  33  Nov  1939   and is later fleshed out in Batman  47  As these comics state  Bruce Wayne is born to Dr  Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha  two very wealthy and charitable Gotham City socialites  Bruce is brought up in Wayne Manor  with its wealthy splendor  and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight  when his parents are killed by a small time criminal named Joe Chill while on their way home from a movie theater  Bruce Wayne swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents  lives  He engages in intense intellectual and physical training  however  he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough   Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot   Wayne remarks   so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts  I must be a creature of the night  black  terrible     As if responding to his desires  a bat suddenly flies through the window  inspiring Bruce to take on the persona of Batman  64  In early strips  Batman s career as a vigilante earns him the ire of the police  During this period Wayne has a fianc e named Julie Madison  65  Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat  Dick Grayson  who becomes his sidekick  Robin  Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America  66  although he  like Superman  is an honorary member  67  and thus only participates occasionally  Batman s relationship with the law thaws quickly  and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City s police department  68  During this time  butler Alfred Pennyworth arrives at Wayne Manor  and after deducing the Dynamic Duo s secret identities joins their service  69  Silver Age The Silver Age of Comic Books in DC Comics is sometimes held to have begun in 1956 when the publisher introduced Barry Allen as a new  updated version of The Flash  Batman is not significantly changed by the late 1950s for the continuity which would be later referred to as Earth One  The lighter tone Batman had taken in the period between the Golden and Silver Ages led to the stories of the late 1950s and early 1960s that often feature a large number of science fiction elements  and Batman is not significantly updated in the manner of other characters until Detective Comics  327  May 1964   in which Batman reverts to his detective roots  with most science fiction elements jettisoned from the series  After the introduction of DC Comics  multiverse in the 1960s  DC established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth Two Batman  a character from a parallel world  This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth Two Catwoman  Selina Kyle  as shown in Superman Family  211  and fathers Helena Wayne  who  as the Huntress  becomes  along with Dick Grayson  the Earth Two Robin  Gotham s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner  a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman  Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre revamp and post revamp Batmen  since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern  Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s  and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age  70  Nevertheless  details of Batman s history were altered or expanded upon through the decades  Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth  his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne  introduced in Batman  208  January February 1969  after his parents  death  and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin  respectively  71  72  In 1980 then editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman s origin and history  Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age  most notably Superman  whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team ups in World s Finest Comics  starting in 1954 and continuing through the series  cancellation in 1986  Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends  Batman becomes a founding member of the Justice League of America  appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold  28  In the 1970s and 1980s  Brave and the Bold became a Batman title  in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month  In 1969  Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics  effort to revise the Batman comics  Additionally  Batman also moves from his mansion  Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City  in order to be closer to Gotham City s crime  Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo  with occasional team ups with Robin and or Batgirl  Batman s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period  depicting increasingly violent crimes  including the first appearance  since the early Golden Age  of the Joker as a homicidal psychopath  and the arrival of Ra s al Ghul  a centuries old terrorist who knows Batman s secret identity  In the 1980s  Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing  3  In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983  Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders  He serves as the team s leader until Batman and the Outsiders  32  1986  and the comic subsequently changed its title  Modern Batman After the 12 issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths  DC Comics retconned the histories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences  Frank Miller retold Batman s origin in the storyline  Year One  from Batman  404 407  which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character  73  Though the Earth Two Batman is erased from history  many stories of Batman s Silver Age Earth One career  along with an amount of Golden Age ones  remain canonical in the post Crisis universe  with his origins remaining the same in essence  despite alteration  For example  Gotham s police are mostly corrupt  setting up further need for Batman s existence  While Dick Grayson s past remains much the same  the history of Jason Todd  the second Robin  is altered  turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook  who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile  74  Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred Pennyworth  Additionally  Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America  although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987  To help fill in the revised backstory for Batman following Crisis  DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one shot stories since then that largely take place during the  Year One  period  Various stories from Jeph Loeb and Matt Wagner also touch upon this era  In 1988 s  Batman  A Death in the Family  storyline from Batman  426 429 Jason Todd  the second Robin  is killed by the Joker  3  Subsequently Batman begins exhibiting an excessive  reckless approach to his crime fighting  a result of the pain of losing Jason Todd  Batman works solo until the decade s close  when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin  75  In 2005  writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor as the murderous vigilante the Red Hood  Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter title crossovers that run for a number of issues  In 1993  DC published both  The Death of Superman  storyline and  Knightfall    In the Knightfall storyline s first phase  the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman  leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role  After the end of  Knightfall   the storylines split in two directions  following both the Azrael Batman s adventures  and Bruce Wayne s quest to become Batman once more  The story arcs realign in  KnightsEnd   as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne  Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson  then Nightwing  for an interim period  while Wayne trains to return to the role  76  The 1994 company wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again  including those of Batman  Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force  Similarly  the Waynes  killer is never caught or identified  effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity  rendering stories such as  Year Two  non canon  Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison s 1996 relaunch of the series  titled JLA  While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team s successes  the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade s closing crossover arc  In 1998 s  Cataclysm  storyline  Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake and ultimately cut off from the United States Government afterwards  Deprived of many of his technological resources  Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999 s  No Man s Land   Meanwhile  Batman s relationship with the Gotham City Police Department changed for the worse with the events of  Batman  Officer Down  and  Batman  War Games War Crimes   Batman s long time law enforcement allies Commissioner Gordon and Harvey Bullock are forced out of the police department in  Officer Down   while  War Games  and  War Crimes  saw Batman become a wanted fugitive after a contingency plan of his to neutralize Gotham City s criminal underworld is accidentally triggered  resulting in a massive gang war that ends with the sadistic Black Mask the undisputed ruler of the city s criminal gangs  Other troubles come for Batman in the form of Lex Luthor  secretly behind the events of  No Man s Land    who seeks revenge for Bruce Wayne cancelling all of his company s government contracts upon Luthor being elected President of the United States  Luthor arranges for the murder of Batman s on again  off again love interest Vesper  introduced in the mid 1990s  during the  Bruce Wayne  Murderer   and  Bruce Wayne  Fugitive  story arcs  Though Batman is able to clear his name  he loses another ally in the form of his new bodyguard Sasha  who is recruited into the organization known as  Checkmate  while stuck in prison due to her refusal to turn states evidence against her employer  While he was unable to prove that Luthor was behind the murder of Vesper  Batman does get his revenge with help from Talia al Ghul in Superman Batman  1 6  not only does he bring down Lex Luthor s Presidency but also engages in a hostile take over of Luthor s corporate holdings  bankrupting the villain in the process  DC s 2005 limited series Identity Crisis reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman s memories to prevent him from stopping the League from lobotomizing Dr  Light after he raped Sue Dibny  This served as a retcon for Batman s complete distrust for his fellow superheroes after he remembers  which  under writers such as Mark Waid in the  Tower of Babel  arc in JLA  manifested itself in the form of Batman keeping extensive files on how to kill his fellow superheroes  Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over and if necessary  kill the other heroes  It is eventually co opted by Maxwell Lord  who then kills superhero Blue Beetle to keep him from alerting the Justice League of the existence of Batman s murderous creation  The revelation of Batman s creation and his tacit responsibility for Blue Beetle s death becomes a driving force in the lead up to the Infinite Crisis miniseries  which again restructures DC continuity  In Infinite Crisis  7  Alexander Luthor  Jr  mentions that in the newly rewritten history of the  New Earth   created in the previous issue  the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne   again  Joe Chill   was captured  thus undoing the retcon created after Zero Hour  Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs  though at the very end Batman reaches his apparent breaking point when Alexander Luthor Jr  seriously wounds Nightwing  Picking up a gun  Batman nearly shoots Luthor in order to avenge his former sidekick  until Wonder Woman convinces him to not pull the trigger  Following Infinite Crisis  Bruce Wayne  Dick Grayson  having recovered from his wounds   and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City  to  rebuild Batman   77  In the Face the Face storyline  Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year long absence  Part of this absence is captured during Week 30 of the 52 series  which shows Batman fighting his inner demons  78  Later on in 52  Batman is shown undergoing an intense meditation ritual in Nanda Parbat  This becomes an important part of the regular Batman title  which reveals that Batman is reborn as a more effective crime fighter while undergoing this ritual  having  hunted down and ate  the last traces of fear in his mind  79  80  At the end of the  Face the Face  story arc  Bruce officially adopts Tim  who had lost both of his parents at various points in the character s history  as his son  81  The follow up story arc in Batman  Batman  amp  Son  introduces Damian Wayne  who is Batman s son with Talia al Ghul  Batman  along with Superman and Wonder Woman  reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series  82  and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders  83  Grant Morrison s 2008 storyline  Batman R I P   featuring Batman being physically and mentally broken by the enigmatic  Black Glove   garnered much news coverage in advance of its highly promoted conclusion  which would supposedly feature the death of Bruce Wayne  84  85  The original intention was  in fact  not for Batman to die in the pages of  R I P    but for the story to continue with the current DC event Final Crisis and have the death occur there  As such  a two issue bridge arc was designed called  Last Rites  that showed Batman survive his helicopter crash into the Gotham City River and return to the Batcave  only to be summoned to the Hall of Justice by the JLA to help investigate Orion s death  This in turn led into the events of  Final Crisis   which began publication during the conclusion of  Batman RIP    where Batman is kidnapped by Granny Goodness   Last Rites  told the tale of Batman being mentally probed by Darkseid s minions Mokkari and Simyon  in an attempt to cull the personality traits that make Batman the successful superhero that he is in order to transplant them into cloned bodies  The plan fails due to the clones  unable to handle the stress and grief Batman processes on a daily basis choose to kill themselves rather than endure such a tortured existence  The two parter concludes with a major  Final Crisis  plot point  as it is revealed that Batman kept the bullet used to kill Orion in his utility belt  86  The Batman s apparent death occurs in Final Crisis  6 when he confronts Darkseid  and announces that he will make a once in a lifetime exception by using a firearm when facing the villain  Wielding a sidearm made by Apokolips  Batman shoots Darkseid in the chest with a bullet made of Radion  the same bullet used to kill Orion   just as Darkseid unleashes his Omega Sanction  or the  death that is life   upon Batman  87  However  the Omega Sanction does not actually kill its target  but sends its consciousness into parallel worlds  Although the presence of Batman s corpse would suggest that he is dead  at the conclusion of Final Crisis it is revealed that Batman has been sent to the distant past where he is able to watch the passing of Anthro  88  89  The three issue Battle for the Cowl miniseries    cowl  referring to Batman s mask  sees those closest to Wayne compete for the  right  to assume the role of Batman  Eventually  Grayson reluctantly assumes the role  90  Tim Drake takes on the identity of Red Robin  questing around the world searching for Bruce Wayne  who he believes is still alive  91  In Blackest Night  the villain Black Hand is seen digging up Bruce Wayne s body  stealing his skull  and recruiting it into the Black Lantern Corps  92 Deadman  whose body has also become a Black Lantern  rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin  along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns  as well as their own family members  93  The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern  reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand s lord  Nekron  to move against the Justice League and the Titans  After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League  the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether  Nekron also referred to the skull as  Bruce Wayne   knowing that the body was not authentic  94  In Batman and Robin s third storyline   Blackest Knight   it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of Final Crisis  6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of  Batmen   Because of this  the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake  Dick Grayson  thinking it was Bruce Wayne s real body  attempted to resurrect it in a Lazarus Pit only to be met with a fierce  mindless combatant  He then realized the truth about the body  95  96  Morrison s storyline continues with the miniseries Batman  The Return of Bruce Wayne  In the miniseries  Bruce travels through time from the prehistoric era back to present day Gotham  However  the Dark Knight must overcome unforeseen obstacles  unbeknownst to the hero  Darkseid turned him into a living doomsday weapon when he sent him back in time  which forces Batman s allies to stop him  97  97  98  99  Thanks to his allies  Batman is able to foil Darkseid s final plan and return to the present  After Bruce s return  he returns to his role as the Dark Knight on a global scale  thus allowing Dick and Damian to continue as Gotham s Dynamic Duo  This is seen in the new ongoing series Batman Incorporated  where Batman will form an army of heroes that will serve as the Batman on every country of the world  To this end  Bruce publicly announces that Wayne Enterprises will aid Batman on his mission  known as  Batman  Incorporated   Also  Batman is the protagonist in the new title Batman  The Dark Knight  which will be written and drawn by David Finch  This new title details Batman s most recent adventures in Gotham to investigate about the disappearance of his friend Dawn Golden  in an environment of mysticism and magic  The New 52 relaunch In September 2011  Batman  Detective Comics  Batman and Robin and Batman  The Dark Knight were relaunched as part of The New 52  DC s line wide reboot of every one of its books  In the new series  Bruce Wayne is the sole character to be identified as Batman while Dick Grayson returns to the Nightwing identity  Damian will continue to be Robin under his father s guidance  Characterization Batman s primary character traits can be summarized as  wealth  physical prowess  deductive abilities and obsession   61  The details and tone of Batman comic books have varied over the years due to different creative teams  Dennis O Neil noted that character consistency was not a major concern during early editorial regimes   Julie Schwartz did a Batman in Batman and Detective and Murray Boltinoff did a Batman in the Brave and the Bold and apart from the costume they bore very little resemblance to each other  Julie and Murray did not coordinate their efforts  did not pretend to  did not want to  were not asked to  Continuity was not important in those days   100  The driving force behind Batman s character is from his childhood  Bob Kane and Bill Finger discussed Batman s background and decided that  there s nothing more traumatic than having your parents murdered before your eyes   101  Despite his trauma  he is driven to train to become a brilliant scientist 102  103  and train his body into absolute physical perfection 102  103  to fight crime in Gotham City as Batman  an inspired idea from Wayne s insight into the criminal mind  102  103  Another of Batman s characterizations is a vigilante  in order to stop evil that started with the death of his parents  he must sometimes break laws himself  Although manifested differently by being re told by different artists  it is nevertheless that the details and the prime components of Batman s origin have never varied at all in the comic books  the  reiteration of the basic origin events holds together otherwise divergent expressions   104  The origin is the source of the character s traits and attributes  which play out in many of the character s adventures  61  Batman is often treated as a vigilante by other characters in his stories  Frank Miller views the character as  a dionysian figure  a force for anarchy that imposes an individual order   105  Dressed as a bat  Batman deliberately cultivates a frightening persona in order to aid him in crime fighting  106  a fear that originates from the criminals  own guilty conscience  107  Bruce Wayne In his secret identity  Batman is Bruce Wayne  a wealthy businessman who lives in Gotham City  To the world at large  Bruce Wayne is often seen as an irresponsible  superficial playboy who lives off his family s personal fortune  amassed when his family invested in Gotham real estate before the city was a bustling metropolis  108  and the profits of Wayne Enterprises  a major private technology firm that he inherits  However  Wayne is also known for his contributions to charity  notably through his Wayne Foundation  a charity devoted to helping the victims of crime and preventing people from becoming criminals  109  Bruce creates the playboy public persona to aid in throwing off suspicion of his secret identity  often acting dim witted and self absorbed to further the act  110  Among the more noted measures he uses to maintain the facade is pretending he is a heavy drinker by claiming his glasses of ginger ale are strong beverages  Bruce is actually a strict teetotaler to maintain his physical fitness and mental acuity  Writers of both Batman and Superman stories have often compared the two within the context of various stories  to varying conclusions  Like Superman  the prominent persona of Batman s dual identities varies with time  Modern age comics have tended to portray  Bruce Wayne  as the facade  with  Batman  as the truer representation of his personality 111   in counterpoint to the post Crisis Superman  whose  Clark Kent  persona is the  real  personality  and  Superman  is the  mask    112  113  In Batman Unmasked  a television documentary about the psychology of the character  Associate Professor of Social Psychology at the University of California  Los Angeles  and an adjunct behavioral scientist at the Rand Corporation Benjamin Karney  notes that Batman s personality is driven by Bruce Wayne s inherent humanity  that  Batman  for all its benefits and for all of the time Bruce Wayne devotes to it  is ultimately a tool for Bruce Wayne s efforts to make the world better   As noted in the Will Brooker book  Batman Unmasked   the confirmation of Batman s identity lies with the young audience   he doesn t have to be Bruce Wayne  he just needs the suit and gadgets  the abilities  and most importantly the morality  the humanity  There s just a sense about him   they trust him    and they re never wrong   114  Finger came up with the name  Bruce Wayne  for the superhero s secret identity  In Jim Steranko s History of the Comics  vol  1  Bill Finger reveals   Bruce Wayne s first name came from Robert Bruce  the Scottish patriot  Wayne  being a playboy  was a man of gentry  I searched for a name that would suggest colonialism  I tried Adams  Hancock   then I thought of Mad Anthony Wayne   In T  James Musler s book Unleashing the Superhero in Us All  he explores the extent to which money is important in Bruce Wayne s life  115  Dick Grayson Main article  Dick Grayson While Wayne traveled through time to get back to the present  Dick Grayson became the new Batman  This was the second time he had taken on the mantle in Bruce Wayne s absence  albeit the first time  when Wayne was recovering from his broken back  reluctantly  After Wayne s  death   Dick stated that he had no problem becoming Batman  but Wayne had left a prerecorded message telling him not to take up the mantle and to continue fighting crime as Nightwing with Robin at his side  Realizing that Gotham still needed the Dark Knight  Dick retired his Nightwing mantle to become the new Batman  With Wayne s return and plans to launch Batman worldwide  Dick remained the Batman of Gotham City  After the events of Flashpoint  Dick returned to being Nightwing  In an interview with IGN  Morrison details that having Grayson as Batman and Damian Wayne as Robin represented a  reverse  of the normal dynamic between Batman and Robin  with   a more light hearted and spontaneous Batman and a scowling  badass Robin   Morrison explains his intentions for the new characterization of Batman   Dick Grayson is kind of this consummate superhero  The guy has been Batman s partner since he was a kid  he s led the Teen Titans  and he s trained with everybody in the DC Universe  So he s a very different kind of Batman  He s a lot easier  He s a lot looser and more relaxed   57  Powers  abilities  and resources Batman has no inherent superhuman powers  To compensate for this he relies on  his own scientific knowledge  detective skills  and athletic prowess   25  In the stories Batman is regarded as one of the world s greatest detectives  if not the world s greatest crime solver  116  In Grant Morrison s first storyline in JLA  Superman describes Batman as  the most dangerous man on Earth   able to defeat a team of superpowered aliens by himself in order to rescue his imprisoned teammates  He has spent a significant portion of his life traveling the world and acquiring the skills needed to aid in his crusade against crime  His knowledge and expertise in almost every discipline known to man is nearly unparalleled by any other character in the DC universe  117  He is also a master of disguise  often gathering information under the identity of Matches Malone  a notorious gangster  Additionally  the Batman has been repeatedly described as one of the greatest martial artists in the DC Universe  his skills in hand to hand combat are said to rival such notable martial artists as Lady Shiva  Bronze Tiger  and Richard Dragon  His batsuit also aids in his combat against enemies  having the properties of both Kevlar and Nomex  It protects him from gunfire and other significant impacts  However  Batman s most defining characteristic is his strong commitment to justice and his unwillingness to take life  regardless of the situation with which he is faced  This unyielding moral aptitude has earned him the respect of several heroes in the DC Universe  most notably that of Superman and Wonder Woman  Costume Main article  Batsuit Batman s costume incorporates the imagery of a bat in order to frighten criminals  118  The details of the Batman costume change repeatedly through various stories and media  but the most distinctive elements remain consistent  a scallop hem cape  a cowl covering most of the face featuring a pair of batlike ears  and a stylized bat emblem on the chest  and the ever present utility belt  The costumes  colors are traditionally blue and grey  118  although this colorization arose due to the way comic book art is colored  118  Finger and Kane conceptualized Batman as having a black cape and cowl and grey suit  but conventions in coloring called for black to be highlighted with blue  118  This coloring has been claimed by Larry Ford  in Place  Power  Situation  and Spectacle  A Geography of Film  to be an inversion of conventional color coding symbolism  which sees  bad guys  wearing dark colors  119  Batman s gloves typically feature three scallops that protrude from long  gauntlet like cuffs  although in his earliest appearances he wore short  plain gloves without the scallops  A yellow ellipse around the bat logo on the character s chest was added in 1964  and became the hero s trademark symbol  akin to the red and yellow  S  symbol of Superman  120  The overall look of the character  particularly the length of the cowl s ears and of the cape  varies greatly depending on the artist  Dennis O Neil said   We now say that Batman has two hundred suits hanging in the Batcave so they don t have to look the same       Everybody loves to draw Batman  and everybody wants to put their own spin on it   121  Equipment See also  Batman s utility belt The 1966 television Batmobile was built by George Barris from a Lincoln Futura concept car  Batman uses a large arsenal of specialized gadgets in his war against crime  the designs of which usually share a bat motif  Batman historian Les Daniels credits Gardner Fox with creating the concept of Batman s arsenal with the introduction of the utility belt in Detective Comics  29  July 1939  and the first bat themed weapons the batarang and the  Batgyro  in Detective Comics  31 and  32  September  October  1939   21  Batman s primary vehicle is the Batmobile  which is usually depicted as an imposing black car with large tailfins that suggest a bat s wings  Batman s other vehicles include the Batplane  aka the Batwing   Batboat  Bat Sub  and Batcycle  In proper practice  the  bat  prefix  as in batmobile or batarang  is rarely used by Batman himself when referring to his equipment  particularly after some portrayals  primarily the 1960s Batman live action television show and the Super Friends animated series  stretched the practice to campy proportions  The 1960s television series Batman has an arsenal that includes such  bat   names as the bat computer  bat scanner  bat radar  bat cuffs  bat pontoons  bat drinking water dispenser  bat camera with polarized bat filter  bat shark repellent bat spray  and bat rope  The storyline  A Death in the Family  suggests that given Batman s grim nature  he is unlikely to have adopted the  bat  prefix on his own  Batman keeps most of his field equipment in a utility belt  Over the years it is shown to contain a virtually limitless variety of crime fighting tools  Different versions of the belt have these items stored in either pouches or hard cylinders attached evenly around it  A typical major exception to the range of Batman s equipment are conventional firearms  which he refuses to use on principle considering that weapon class was the instrument of his parents  murder  Modern depictions of Batman have him compromise for practicality by arming his vehicles mainly for the purpose of removing obstacles or disabling enemy vehicles  Bat Signal Main article  Bat Signal When Batman is needed  the Gotham City police activate a searchlight with a bat shaped insignia over the lens called the Bat Signal which shines into the night sky  creating a bat symbol on a passing cloud which can be seen from any point in Gotham  The origin of the signal varies  depending on the continuity and medium  In various incarnations  most notably the 1960s Batman TV series  Commissioner Gordon also has a dedicated phone line  dubbed the Bat Phone  connected to a bright red telephone  in the TV series  which sits on a wooden base and has a transparent cake cover on top  The line connects directly to Batman s residence  Wayne Manor  specifically both to a similar phone sitting on the desk in Bruce Wayne s study and the extension phone in the Batcave  Batcave Main article  Batcave The Batcave is Batman s secret headquarters  consisting of a series of subterranean caves beneath his mansion  Wayne Manor  It serves as his command center for both local and global surveillance  as well as housing his vehicles and equipment for his war on crime  It also is a storeroom for Batman s memorabilia  In both the comic Batman  Shadow of the Bat  issue  45  and the 2005 film Batman Begins  the cave is said to have been part of the Underground Railroad  Of the heroes and villains who see the Batcave  few know where it is located  Supporting characters Main article  List of Batman supporting characters Batman with his sidekick Robin  Painting by Alex Ross

Batman s ally in the Gotham City police  debuted along with Batman in Detective Comics  27 and has been a consistent presence since then  Later on  Batman gained Alfred as his butler and Lucius Fox as his business manager and apparently unwitting armorer  However  the most important supporting role in the Batman mythos is filled by the hero s young sidekick Robin  122  The first Robin  Dick Grayson  eventually leaves his mentor and becomes the hero Nightwing  though he and Batman would still continue to work together  The second Robin  Jason Todd  is badly beaten and then killed in an explosion set by the Joker  but is later revived as an adversary  using the Joker s old persona  the Red Hood  Tim Drake  the third Robin  first appeared in 1989 and went on to star in his own comic series  Alfred  Bruce Wayne s loyal butler  father figure  and one of the few to know his secret identity    lends  a homey touch to Batman s environs and  is  ever ready to provide a steadying and reassuring hand  to the hero and his sidekick  123  Batman is at times a member of superhero teams such as the Justice League of America and the Outsiders  Batman has often been paired in adventure with his Justice League teammate Superman  notably as the co stars of World s Finest and Superman Batman series  In pre Crisis continuity  the two are depicted as close friends  however  in current continuity  they have a mutually respectful but uneasy relationship  with an emphasis on their differing views on crime fighting and justice  In Superman Batman  3  December 2003   Superman observes   Sometimes  I admit  I think of Bruce as a man in a costume  Then  with some gadget from his utility belt  he reminds me that he has an extraordinarily inventive mind  And how lucky I am to be able to call on him   124  Batman is involved romantically with many women throughout his various incarnations  These range from society women such as Julie Madison  Vicki Vale  and Silver St  Cloud  to allies like Wonder Woman and Sasha Bordeaux  to even villainesses such as Catwoman and Talia al Ghul  with the latter of whom he sired a son  Damian  and with the former of whom sired a daughter  Helena  on Earth Two   While these relationships tend to be short  Batman s attraction to Catwoman is present in nearly every version and medium in which the characters appear  Authors have gone back and forth over the years as to how Batman manages the  playboy  aspect of Bruce Wayne s personality  at different times he embraces or flees from the women interested in attracting  Gotham s most eligible bachelor   Other supporting characters in Batman s world include former Batgirl Barbara Gordon  Commissioner Gordon s daughter who  now using a wheelchair due to a gunshot wound inflicted by the Joker  serves the superhero community at large as the computer hacker Oracle  Azrael  a would be assassin who replaces Bruce Wayne as Batman for a time  Cassandra Cain  an assassin s daughter who became the new

of Batman s villains  Art by Jim Lee  Batman faces a variety of foes ranging from common criminals to outlandish supervillains  The list is one of the most recognizable in popular culture   many of them mirror aspects of the Batman s character and development  often having tragic origin stories that lead them to a life of crime  123  Batman s  most implacable foe  is the Joker  a psychopathic  clown like criminal who  as a  personification of the irrational   represents  everything Batman  opposes    29  Other long time recurring antagonists include Catwoman  the Scarecrow  the Penguin  Two Face  the Riddler  Mr  Freeze  Poison Ivy  and Ra s al Ghul  among many others  Cultural impact Batman has become a pop culture icon  recognized around the world  The character s presence has extended beyond his comic book origins  events such as the release of the 1989 Batman film and its accompanying merchandising  brought the Batman to the forefront of public consciousness   52  In an article commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the character  The Guardian wrote   Batman is a figure blurred by the endless reinvention that is modern mass culture  He is at once an icon and a commodity  the perfect cultural artefact for the 21st century   126  In addition  media outlets have often used the character in trivial and comprehensive surveys   Forbes magazine estimated Bruce Wayne to be the 9th richest fictional character with his  5 8 billion fortune  several places after Iron Man  who is at 6  127 BusinessWeek listed the character as one of the ten most intelligent superheroes appearing in American comics  128 Entertainment Weekly named Batman as one of The 20 All Time Coolest Heroes in Pop Culture  129  He also was placed on AFI s 100 Years 100 Heroes and Villains from the 1989 feature film by the American Film Institute  130  In other media Main article  Batman franchise media The character of Batman has appeared in various media aside from comic books  The character has been developed as a vehicle for newspaper syndicated comic strips  books  radio dramas  television  and several theatrical feature films  The first adaptation of Batman was as a daily newspaper comic strip which premiered on October 25  1943  131  That same year the character was adapted in the 15 part serial Batman  with Lewis Wilson becoming the first actor to portray Batman on screen  While Batman never had a radio series of his own  the character made occasional guest appearance in The Adventures of Superman starting in 1945 on occasions when Superman voice actor Bud Collyer needed time off  132  A second movie serial  Batman and Robin  followed in 1949  with Robert Lowery taking over the role of Batman  The exposure provided by these adaptations during the 1940s  helped make  Batman  a household name for millions who never bought a comic book   132  In the 1964 publication of Donald Barthelme s collection of short stories  Come Back  Dr  Caligari   Barthelme wrote  The Joker s Greatest Triumph   Batman is portrayed for purposes of spoof as a pretentious French speaking rich man  133  Michael Keaton as Batman in Tim Burton s Batman  1989  The Batman television series  starring Adam West  premiered in January 1966 on the ABC television network  Inflected with a camp sense of humor  the show became a pop culture phenomenon  In his memoir  Back to the Batcave  West notes his dislike for the term  camp  as it was applied to the 1960s series  opining that the show was instead a farce or lampoon  and a deliberate one  at that  The series ran for 120 episodes  ending in 1968  In between the first and second season of the Batman television series the cast and crew made the theatrical release Batman  1966   The Kinks performed the theme song from the Batman series on their 1967 album Live at Kelvin Hall  The popularity of the Batman TV series also resulted in the first animated adaptation of Batman in the series The Batman Superman Hour  134  the Batman segments of the series were repackaged as The Adventures of Batman and Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder which produced thirty three episodes between 1968 and 1977  From 1973 until 1986  Batman had a starring role in ABC s Super Friends series  which was animated by Hanna Barbera  Olan Soule was the voice of Batman in all these series  but was eventually replaced during Super Friends by Adam West  who voiced the character in Filmation s 1977 series The New Adventures of Batman  In 1989  Batman returned to movie theaters in director Tim Burton s Batman starring Michael Keaton as the title character  The film was a huge success  not only was it the top grossing film of the year  but at the time was the fifth highest grossing film in history  135  The film spawned three sequels  Batman Returns  1992   Batman Forever  1995   and Batman  amp  Robin  1997   the latter two of which were directed by Joel Schumacher instead of Burton  and replaced Keaton as Batman with Val Kilmer and George Clooney  respectively  The second Schumacher film  while a box office success  failed to outgross any of its predecessors and was critically panned  causing Warner Bros  to cancel the planned fifth film  Batman Triumphant  and place the film series on hiatus  Batman as he was depicted in Batman  The Animated Series  1992 1995  In 1992  Batman returned to television in Batman  The Animated

Les Daniels described the series as   coming  as close as any artistic statement has to defining the look of Batman for the 1990s   136  137  138  The success of Batman  The Animated Series led to the theatrical spin off film Batman  Mask of the Phantasm  1993   as well as various other series set in the same continuity  including Superman  The Animated Series  The New Batman Adventures  Justice League  and Justice League Unlimited  As with Batman  The Animated Series  each of these productions featured Kevin Conroy as the voice of Batman  The futuristic series Batman Beyond was also set in the same continuity as Batman  The Animated Series  and featured a newer  younger Batman voiced by Will Friedle  In 2004  a new animated series titled The Batman made its debut with Rino Romano as the title character  In 2008  this show was replaced by another animated series  Batman  The Brave and the Bold  with Diedrich Bader as Batman  In 2013  a new CGI animated series titled Beware the Batman will make its debut  In 2005  Batman Begins  a reboot of the film series  was released  directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Christian Bale as Batman  Its sequel  The Dark Knight  2008   set the record for the highest grossing opening weekend of all time in the U S   earning approximately  158 million  139  and became the fastest film to reach the  400 million mark in the history of American cinema  eighteenth day of release   140  These record breaking attendances saw The Dark Knight listed as the third highest domestic grossing film of all time with  533 million  bested only by Titanic and Avatar  141  Another sequel  The Dark Knight Rises  is expected to be released in 2012  and is said to be the final Batman film to feature Nolan and Bale as director and leading actor  respectively  Homosexual interpretations Further information  Homosexuality in the Batman franchise Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson  Panel from Batman  84  June 1954   page 24  Controversy has arisen over various sexual interpretations made regarding the content of Batman comics in the early decades  Homosexual interpretations have been part of the academic study of Batman since psychologist Fredric Wertham asserted in his Seduction of the Innocent in 1954 that  Batman stories are psychologically homosexual   He claimed   The Batman type of story may stimulate children to homosexual fantasies  of the nature of which they may be unconscious   Wertham wrote   Only someone ignorant of the fundamentals of psychiatry and of the psychopathology of sex can fail to realize a subtle atmosphere of homoeroticism which pervades the adventures of the mature  Batman  and his young friend  Robin    142  Andy Medhurst wrote in his 1991 essay  Batman  Deviance  and Camp  that Batman is interesting to gay audiences because  he was one of the first fictional characters to be attacked on the grounds of his presumed homosexuality    the 1960s TV series remains a touchstone of camp   and   he  merits analysis as a notably successful construction of masculinity   143  Creators associated with the character have expressed their own opinions  Writer Alan Grant has stated   The Batman I wrote for 13 years isn t gay  Denny O Neil s Batman  Marv Wolfman s Batman  everybody s Batman all the way back to Bob Kane    none of them wrote him as a gay character  Only Joel Schumacher might have had an opposing view   Writer Devin Grayson has commented   It depends who you ask  doesn t it  Since you re asking me  I ll say no  I don t think he is     I certainly understand the gay readings  though   144  While Frank Miller has described the relationship between Batman and the Joker as a  homophobic nightmare   145  he views the character as sublimating his sexual urges into crimefighting  concluding   He d be much healthier if he were gay   146 Burt Ward  who portrayed Robin in the 1960s television show  has also remarked upon this interpretation in his autobiography Boy Wonder  My Life in Tights  he writes that the relationship could be interpreted as a sexual one  with the show s double entendres and lavish camp also possibly offering ambiguous interpretation  147  Such homosexual interpretations continue to attract attention  One notable example occurred in 2000  when DC Comics refused to allow permission for the reprinting of four panels  from Batman  79  92  105 and 139  to illustrate Christopher York s paper All in the Family  Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s  148  Another happened in the summer of 2005  when painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of watercolors depicting both Batman and Robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses  149  DC threatened both artist and the Kathleen Cullen Fine Arts gallery with legal action if they did not cease selling the works and demanded all remaining art  as well as any profits derived from them  150  Will Brooker argues in Batman Unmasked  Analyzing a Cultural Icon  151  that a queer reading of Batman is a valid interpretation  and that homosexual readers would naturally find themselves drawn to the lifestyle depicted within  whether the character of Bruce Wayne himself is explicity homosexual or not  He also identifies a homophobic element to the vigour with which mainstream fandom rejects the possibility of a homosexual reading of the character  Notes   Goulart  Ron  Comic Book
