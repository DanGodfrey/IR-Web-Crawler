Dementia From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search For other uses  see Dementia  disambiguation   Dementia Classification and external resources ICD 10 F00 F07 ICD 9 290 294 DiseasesDB 29283 MedlinePlus 000739 MeSH D003704 Dementia  taken from Latin  originally meaning  madness   from de   without    ment  the root of mens  mind   is a serious loss of global cognitive ability in a previously unimpaired person  beyond what might be expected from normal aging  It may be static  the result of a unique global brain injury  or progressive  resulting in long term decline due to damage or disease in the body  Although dementia is far more common in the geriatric population  it can occur before the age of 65  in which case it is termed  early onset dementia   1  A recent survey done by Harvard University School of Public Health and the Alzheimer s Europe consortium revealed that the second leading health concern  after cancer  among adults is Dementia  2  Dementia is not a single disease  but rather a non specific illness syndrome  i e   set of signs and symptoms  in which affected areas of cognition may be memory  attention  language  and problem solving  It is normally required to be present for at least 6 months to be diagnosed  3  cognitive dysfunction that has been seen only over shorter times  in particular less than weeks  must be termed delirium  In all types of general cognitive dysfunction  higher mental functions are affected first in the process  Especially in the later stages of the condition  affected persons may be disoriented in time  not knowing what day of the week  day of the month  or even what year it is   in place  not knowing where they are   and in person  not knowing who they  or others around them  are   Dementia  though often treatable to some degree  is usually due to causes that are progressive and incurable  4  Symptoms of dementia can be classified as either reversible or irreversible  depending upon the etiology of the disease  Fewer than 10  of cases of dementia are due to causes that may presently be reversed with treatment  Causes include many different specific disease processes  in the same way that symptoms of organ dysfunction such as shortness of breath  jaundice  or pain are attributable to many etiologies  Without careful assessment of history  the short term syndrome of delirium  often lasting days to weeks  can easily be confused with dementia  because they have all symptoms in common  except duration  Some mental illnesses  including depression and psychosis  may produce symptoms that must be differentiated from both delirium and dementia  5  There are many specific types  causes  of dementia  often showing slightly different symptoms  However  the symptom overlap is such that it is impossible to diagnose the type of dementia by symptomatology alone  and in only a few cases are symptoms enough to give a high probability of some specific cause  Diagnosis is therefore aided by nuclear medicine brain scanning techniques  Certainty cannot be attained except with brain biopsy during life  or at necropsy in death  Some of the most common forms of dementia are  Alzheimer s disease  vascular dementia  frontotemporal dementia  semantic dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies  It is possible for a patient to exhibit two or more dementing processes at the same time  as none of the known types of dementia protects against the others  Indeed  about ten per cent of people with dementia have what is known as  mixed dementia   which may be a combination of Alzheimer s disease and multi infarct dementia  6  Contents 1 Signs and symptoms 1 1 Comorbidities 1 2 Risk to self and others 2 Causes 2 1 Fixed cognitive impairment 2 2 Slowly progressive dementia 2 3 Rapidly

is not merely a problem of memory  It reduces the ability to learn  reason  retain or recall past experience and there is also loss of patterns of thoughts  feelings and activities  Gelder et al  2005   Additional mental and behavioral problems often affect people who have dementia  and may influence quality of life  caregivers  and the need for institutionalization  As dementia worsens individuals may neglect themselves and may become disinhibited and may become incontinent   Gelder et al  2005   Depression affects 20 30  of people who have dementia  and about 20  have anxiety  7  Psychosis  often delusions of persecution  and agitation aggression also often accompany dementia  Each of these needs to be assessed and treated independently of the underlying dementia  8   edit  Risk to self and others The examples and perspective in this article may not represent a worldwide view of the subject  Please improve this article and discuss the issue on the talk page   December 2010  The Canadian Medical Association Journal has reported that driving with dementia could lead to severe injury or even death to self and others  Doctors should advise appropriate testing on when to quit driving  9  In the United States  Florida s Baker Act allows law enforcement and the judiciary to force mental evaluation for those suspected of suffering from dementia or other mental incapacities  citation needed  In the United Kingdom  as with all mental disorders  where a person with dementia could potentially be a danger to themselves or others  they can be detained under the Mental Health Act of 1983 for the purposes of assessment  care and treatment  This is a last resort  and usually avoided if the patient has family or friends who can ensure care  The United Kingdom DVLA  Driving  amp  Vehicle Licensing Agency  states that people with dementia who specifically suffer with poor short term memory  disorientation  lack of insight or judgment are almost certainly not fit to drive and in these instances  the DVLA must be informed so said license can be revoked  They do however acknowledge low severity cases and those with an early diagnosis  and those drivers may be permitted to drive pending medical reports  Behaviour may be disorganized  restless or inappropriate  Some people become restless or wander about by day and sometimes at night  When people suffering from dementia are put in circumstances beyond their abilities  there may be a sudden change to tears or anger  a  catastrophic reaction    10   edit  Causes  edit  Fixed cognitive impairment Various types of brain injury  occurring as a single event  may cause irreversible but fixed cognitive impairment  Traumatic brain injury may cause generalized damage to the white matter of the brain  diffuse axonal injury   or more localized damage  as also may neurosurgery   A temporary reduction in the brain s supply of blood or oxygen may lead to hypoxic ischemic injury  Strokes  ischemic stroke  or intracerebral  subarachnoid  subdural or extradural hemorrhage  or infections  meningitis and or encephalitis  affecting the brain  prolonged epileptic seizures and acute hydrocephalus may also have long term effects on cognition  Excessive alcohol use may cause alcohol dementia  Wernicke s encephalopathy and or Korsakoff s psychosis  and certain other recreational drugs may cause substance induced persisting dementia  once overuse ceases  the cognitive impairment is persistent but not progressive   edit  Slowly progressive dementia Dementia which begins gradually and worsens progressively over several years is usually caused by neurodegenerative disease  that is  by conditions affecting only or primarily the neurons of the brain and causing gradual but irreversible loss of function of these cells  Less commonly  a non degenerative condition may have secondary effects on brain cells  which may or may not be reversible if the condition is treated  The causes of dementia depend on the age at which symptoms begin  In the elderly population  usually defined in this context as over 65 years of age   a large majority of cases of dementia are caused by Alzheimer s disease  vascular dementia or both  Dementia with Lewy bodies is another fairly common cause  which again may occur alongside either or both of the other causes  11  12  13 Hypothyroidism sometimes causes slowly progressive cognitive impairment as the main symptom  and this may be fully reversible with treatment  Normal pressure hydrocephalus  though relatively rare  is important to recognize since treatment may prevent progression and improve other symptoms of the condition  However  significant cognitive improvement is unusual  Dementia is much less common under 65 years of age  Alzheimer s disease is still the most frequent cause  but inherited forms of the disease account for a higher proportion of cases in this age group  Frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Huntington s disease account for most of the remaining cases  14 Vascular dementia also occurs  but this in turn may be due to underlying conditions  including antiphospholipid syndrome  CADASIL  MELAS  homocystinuria  moyamoya and Binswanger s disease   People who receive frequent head trauma  such as boxers or football players  are at risk of chronic traumatic encephalopathy 15   also called dementia pugilistica in boxers   In young adults  up to 40 years of age  who were previously of normal intelligence  it is very rare to develop dementia without other features of neurological disease  or without features of disease elsewhere in the body  Most cases of progressive cognitive disturbance in this age group are caused by psychiatric illness  alcohol or other drugs  or metabolic disturbance  However  certain genetic disorders can cause true neurodegenerative dementia at this age  These include familial Alzheimer s disease  SCA17  dominant inheritance   adrenoleukodystrophy  X linked   Gaucher s disease type 3  metachromatic leukodystrophy  Niemann Pick disease type C  pantothenate kinase associated neurodegeneration  Tay Sachs disease and Wilson s disease  all recessive   Wilson s disease is particularly important since cognition can improve with treatment  At all ages  a substantial proportion of patients who complain of memory difficulty or other cognitive symptoms are suffering from depression rather than a neurodegenerative disease  Vitamin deficiencies and chronic infections may also occur at any age  they usually cause other symptoms before dementia occurs  but occasionally mimic degenerative dementia  These include deficiencies of vitamin B12  folate or niacin  and infective causes including cryptococcal meningitis  HIV  Lyme disease  progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis  syphilis and Whipple s disease   edit  Rapidly progressive dementia Creutzfeldt Jakob disease typically causes a dementia which worsens over weeks to months  being caused by prions  The common causes of slowly progressive dementia also sometimes present with rapid progression  Alzheimer s disease  dementia with Lewy bodies  frontotemporal lobar degeneration  including corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy   On the other hand  encephalopathy or delirium may develop relatively slowly and resemble dementia  Possible causes include brain infection  viral encephalitis  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis  Whipple s disease  or inflammation  limbic encephalitis  Hashimoto s encephalopathy  cerebral vasculitis   tumors such as lymphoma or glioma  drug toxicity  e g  anticonvulsant drugs   metabolic causes such as liver failure or kidney failure  and chronic subdural hematoma   edit  Dementia as a feature of other conditions There are many other medical and neurological conditions in which dementia only occurs late in the illness  or as a minor feature  For example  a proportion of patients with Parkinson s disease develop dementia  though widely varying figures are quoted for this proportion  citation needed  When dementia occurs in Parkinson s disease  the underlying cause may be dementia with Lewy bodies or Alzheimer s disease  or both  16  Cognitive impairment also occurs in the Parkinson plus syndromes of progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration  and the same underlying pathology may cause the clinical syndromes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration   Chronic inflammatory conditions of the brain may affect cognition in the long term  including Beh et s disease  multiple sclerosis  sarcoidosis  Sj gren s syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus  Although the acute porphyrias may cause episodes of confusion and psychiatric disturbance  dementia is a rare feature of these rare diseases  17  Aside from those mentioned above  inherited conditions which may cause dementia alongside other features include  18  Alexander disease Canavan disease Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis DRPLA Fragile X associated tremor ataxia syndrome Glutaric aciduria type 1 Krabbe s disease Maple syrup urine disease Niemann Pick disease type C Kufs  disease Neuroacanthocytosis Organic acidemias Pelizaeus Merzbacher disease Urea cycle disorders Sanfilippo syndrome type B Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2  edit  Diagnosis Proper differential diagnosis between the types of dementia  cortical and subcortical  will require  at the least  referral to a specialist  e g   a geriatric internist  geriatric psychiatrist  neurologist  neuropsychologist or geropsychologist  citation needed  Duration of symptoms must evident for at least six months for a diagnosis of dementia or organic brain syndrome to be made  ICD 10    edit  Cognitive testing Sensitivity and specificity of common tests for dementia Test Sensitivity Specificity Reference MMSE 71  92  56  96   19  3MS 83  93 5  85  90   20  AMTS 73  100  71  100   20  There exist some brief tests  5 15 minutes  that have reasonable reliability and can be used in the office or other setting to screen cognitive status  Examples of such tests include the abbreviated mental test score  AMTS   the mini mental state examination  MMSE   Modified Mini Mental State Examination  3MS   21  the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument  CASI   22  the Trail making test  23  and the clock drawing test  24  Scores must be interpreted in the context of the person s educational and other background  and the particular circumstances  for example  a person highly depressed or in great pain will not be expected to do well on many tests of mental ability  While many tests have been studied  25  26  27  and some may emerge as better alternatives to the MMSE  presently the MMSE is the best studied and most commonly used  Another approach to screening for dementia is to ask an informant  relative or other supporter  to fill out a questionnaire about the person s everyday cognitive functioning  Informant questionnaires provide complementary information to brief cognitive tests  Probably the best known questionnaire of this sort is the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly  IQCODE   28  On the other hand the General Practitioner Assessment Of Cognition combines both  a patient assessment and an informant interview  It was specifically designed for the use in the primary care setting and is also available as a web based test  Further evaluation includes retesting at another date  and administration of other tests of mental function   edit  Laboratory tests Routine blood tests are also usually performed to rule out treatable causes  These tests include vitamin B12  folic acid  thyroid stimulating hormone  TSH   C reactive protein  full blood count  electrolytes  calcium  renal function  and liver enzymes  Abnormalities may suggest vitamin deficiency  infection or other problems that commonly cause confusion or disorientation in the elderly  The problem is complicated by the fact that these cause confusion more often in persons who have early dementia  so that  reversal  of such problems may ultimately only be temporary  citation needed  Testing for alcohol and other known dementia inducing drugs may be indicated   edit  Imaging A CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging  MRI scan  is commonly performed  although these modalities do not have optimal sensitivity for the diffuse metabolic changes associated with dementia in a patient that shows no gross neurological problems  such as paralysis or weakness  on neurological exam  CT or MRI may suggest normal pressure hydrocephalus  a potentially reversible cause of dementia  and can yield information relevant to other types of dementia  such as infarction  stroke  that would point at a vascular type of dementia  The functional neuroimaging modalities of SPECT and PET are more useful in assessing long standing cognitive dysfunction  since they have shown similar ability to diagnose dementia as a clinical exam  29  The ability of SPECT to differentiate the vascular cause from the Alzheimer s disease cause of dementias  appears to be superior to differentiation by clinical exam  30  Recent research has established the value of PET imaging using carbon 11 Pittsburgh Compound B as a radiotracer  PIB PET  in predictive diagnosis of various kinds of dementia  in particular Alzheimer s disease  Studies from Australia have found PIB PET to be 86  accurate in predicting which patients with mild cognitive impairment would develop Alzheimer s disease within two years  In another study  carried out using 66 patients seen at the University of Michigan  PET studies using either PIB or another radiotracer  carbon 11 dihydrotetrabenazine  DTBZ   led to more accurate diagnosis for more than one fourth of patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia  31   edit  Prevention Main article  Prevention of dementia A study done at the University of Bari in Italy  found that a group drinking alcoholic beverages moderately had a slower progression to dementia  In a group of 1 566 elderly Italians  1 445 had no cognitive impairment and 121 had suffered mild cognitive impairment  the study found that that over the duration of 3 5 years the people with MCI who drank less than one alcoholic beverage a day progressed to dementia at a rate that was 85  slower than those who drank no alcoholic beverages  However  the authors of the study commented that since it was epidemiologic  the findings might only be a marker of lifestyle  showing that  moderate lifestyle  in general is associated with slower dementia progression  32  A study failed to show a conclusive link between high blood pressure and developing dementia  The study  published in the Lancet Neurology journal July 2008  found that blood pressure lowering medication did not reduce dementia but that meta analysis of the study data combined with other data suggested that further study could be warranted  33  Brain derived neurotrophic factor  BDNF  expression is associated with prevention of some dementia types  34  35  36  A Canadian study found that a lifetime of bilingualism delays the onset of dementia by an average of four years when compared to monolingual patients  37   edit  Management Except for the treatable types listed above  there is no cure to this illness  Cholinesterase inhibitors are often used early in the disease course  Cognitive and behavioral interventions may also be appropriate  Educating and providing emotional support to the caregiver  or carer  is of importance as well  see also elderly care    edit  Pain and dementia See also  Assessment in nonverbal patients As people age  they experience more health problems  and most health problems associated with aging carry a substantial burden of pain  so  between 25  and 50  of older adults experience persistent pain  Seniors with dementia experience the same prevalence of conditions likely to cause pain as seniors without dementia  38  Pain is often overlooked in older adults and  when screened for  often poorly assessed  especially among those with dementia since they become incapable of informing others that they re in pain  38  39  Beyond the issue of humane care  unrelieved pain has functional implications  Persistent pain can lead to decreased ambulation  depressed mood  sleep disturbances  impaired appetite and exacerbation of cognitive impairment  39  and pain related interference with activity is a factor contributing to falls in the elderly  38  40  Although persistent pain in the person with dementia is difficult to communicate  diagnose and treat  failure to address persistent pain has profound functional  psychosocial and quality of life implications for this vulnerable population  Health professionals often lack the skills and usually lack the time needed to recognize  accurately assess and adequately monitor pain in people with dementia  38  41  Family members and friends can make a valuable contribution to the care of a person with dementia by learning to recognize and assess their pain  Educational resources  such as the Understand Pain and Dementia tutorial  and observational assessment tools are available  38  42  43   edit  Medications Currently  there are no medications that are clinically proven to be preventative or curative of dementia  44  Although some medications are approved for use in the treatment of dementia  these treat the behavioural and cognitive symptoms of dementia  but have no effect on the underlying pathophysiology  45  Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors  Tacrine  Cognex   donepezil  Aricept   galantamine  Razadyne   and rivastigmine  Exelon  are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration  FDA  for treatment of dementia induced by Alzheimer s disease  They may be useful for other similar diseases causing dementia such as Parkinsons or vascular dementia  45 Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors aim to increase the amount of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine  which is deficient in people with dementia  46  This is done by inhibiting the action of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase  which breaksdown acetylcholine as part of normal brain function  47  Though these medications are commonly prescribed  in a minority of patients these drugs can cause side effects including bradycardia and syncope  48  N methyl D aspartate  NMDA  receptor blockers  Memantine is marketed under several names by different pharmaceutical companies including  Abixa  Akatinol  Axura  Ebixa  Memox and Namenda  49  In dementia  NMDA receptors are over stimulated by glutamate  which creates problems for neurotransmission  and thus cognition  and also leads to damage to neurons through excitotoxicity  Memantine is thought to work by improving the  signal to noise  ratio and preventing excitotoxic damage  50  Hence  due to their differing mechanisms of action memantine and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can be used in combination with each other  51  52   edit  Off label  Off label  use of a drug is one that is a use that is not formally approved for the drug by the FDA  but is still legal at a doctor s discretion  Due to lack of formal FDA approval studies in the patient population to be treated  off label use of drugs is common in medical practice  In treating children  the mentally ill  and also persons with dementia  off label drug use is even more common  since lack of informed consent for the treatment group in studies makes these more expensive and difficult  since it must be done by proxy   so that for off patent pharmaceuticals treatment studies are less often done  due to lack of funding  Drugs sometimes used off label to treat underlying causes of dementia  or symptoms of dementia  include  Antidepressant drugs  Depression is frequently associated with dementia and generally worsens the degree of cognitive and behavioral impairment  Antidepressants effectively treat the cognitive and behavioral symptoms of depression in patients with Alzheimer s disease  53  but evidence for their use in other forms of dementia is weak  54  Anxiolytic drugs  Many patients with dementia experience anxiety symptoms  Although benzodiazepines like diazepam  Valium  have been used for treating anxiety in other situations  they are often avoided because they may increase agitation in persons with dementia and are likely to worsen cognitive problems or are too sedating  Buspirone  Buspar  is often initially tried for mild to moderate anxiety  citation needed  There is little evidence for the effectiveness of benzodiazepines in dementia  whereas there is evidence for the effectivess of antipsychotics  at low doses   55  Selegiline  a drug used primarily in the treatment of Parkinson s disease  appears to slow the development of dementia  Selegiline is thought to act as an antioxidant  preventing free radical damage  However  it also acts as a stimulant  making it difficult to determine whether the delay in onset of dementia symptoms is due to protection from free radicals or to the general elevation of brain activity from the stimulant effect  56  Antipsychotic drugs  Both typical antipsychotics  such as Haloperidol  and atypical antipsychotics such as  risperidone  increase the risk of death in dementia associated psychosis  57  This means that any use of antipsychotic medication for dementia associated psychosis is off label and should only be considered after discussing the risks and benefits of treatment with these drugs  and after other treatment modalities have failed  In the UK around 144 000 people with dementia are unnecessarily prescribed antipsychotic drugs  around 2000 patients die as a result of taking the drugs each year  58   edit  Services Adult daycare centers as well as special care units in nursing homes often provide specialized care for dementia patients  Adult daycare centers offer supervision  recreation  meals  and limited health care to participants  as well as providing respite for caregivers  In addition  Home care can provide one on one support and care in the home allowing for more individualized attention that is needed as the disease progresses  While some preliminary studies have found that music therapy may be useful in helping patients with dementia  their quality has been low and no reliable conclusions can be drawn from them  59   edit  Nursing people with dementia Psychiatric nurses can make a distinctive contribution to people s mental health  The four main premises upon which psychiatric nursing is based are  The nursing is an interactive  developmental human activity that is more concerned with the future development of the person than the origins  The experience of mental distress related to the psychiatric disorder is represented through disturbances or reports of private events that are known only to the person concerned  Nurses and the people in care are engaged in a relationship based on mutual influence  The experience of psychiatric disorder is translated into problems of everyday living and the nurse notes the human responses to the psychiatric distress  not the disorder  60   edit  Feeding tubes There is little evidence  even after widespread use  that feeding tubes help patients with advanced dementia gain weight  regain strength or function  prevent aspiration pneumonias  or improve quality of life  The American Geriatric Society  American Neurological Society  and Alzheimer s Association all recommend against placing feeding tubes in a patient with severe dementia  No professional organization recommends feeding tubes be placed in these patients as the current literature does not support the practice  The risks associated with the use of tubes are not well known  61  However  the risks include agitation and the patient pulling out the feeding tube  tubes becoming dislodged  clogged  or malpositioned  There is about a 1  fatality rate directly related to the procedure  lt PMID 11842953 gt  with a 3  major complication rate  lt PMID 9263232 gt   edit  Epidemiology

230 250     250 Evidence from well planned  representative epidemiological surveys is scarce in many regions  particularly in low income countries  However  a 2009 study by Alzheimer Disease International estimated the global prevalence of dementia will almost double every 20 years  from 35 6 million in 2010  to 65 7 million by 2030 and 115 4 million by 2050  62  Around two thirds of individuals with dementia live in low and middle income countries  where the sharpest increases in numbers are predicted  63   edit  History Main articles  Dementia praecox and Alzheimer s disease Up to the end of the 19th century  dementia was a much broader clinical concept  which included mental illness and any type of psychosocial incapacity  including those which could be reversed  64  Dementia at this time simply referred to anyone who had lost the ability to reason  and was applied equally to psychosis of mental illness   organic  diseases like syphilis which could destroy the brain  and to the dementia associated with old age  which was held to be caused by  hardening of the arteries   Dementia when seen in the elderly was called senile dementia or senility and viewed as a normal and somewhat inevitable aspect of growing old  rather than as being caused by any specific diseases  At the same time  in 1907  a specific organic dementing process of early onset  called Alzheimer s disease  had been described  This was associated with particular microscopic changes in the brain  but was seen as a rare disease of middle age  Much like other diseases associated with aging  dementia was rare before the 20th century  although by no means unknown  due to the fact that it is most prevalent in people over 80  and such lifespans were uncommon in preindustrial times  Conversely  syphilitic dementia was widespread in the developed world until largely being eradicated by the use of penicillin after WWII  By the period of 1913 20  schizophrenia had been well defined in a way similar to today  and also the term dementia praecox had been used to suggest the development of senile type dementia at a younger age  Eventually the two terms fused  so that until 1952 physicians used the terms dementia praecox   precocious dementia   and schizophrenia interchangeably  The term  precocious dementia  for a mental illness suggested that a type of mental illness like schizophrenia  including paranoia and decreased cognitive capacity  could be expected to arrive normally in all persons with greater age  see paraphrenia   At the same time  the beginning use of dementia to describe both what we now understand as schizophrenia and senile dementia  after about 1920  acted to give the word  dementia  a more limited role  as one of describing a type of permanent mental deterioration which was not expected to be reversible  This is the beginning of the more recognizable use of the term today  In 1976  neurologist Robert Katzmann suggested a link between  senile dementia  and Alzheimer s disease  65  Katzmann suggested that much of the senile dementia occurring  by definition  after the age of 65  was pathologically identical with Alzheimer s disease occurring before age 65 and therefore should not be treated differently  He noted that the fact that  senile dementia  was not considered a disease  but rather part of aging  was keeping millions of aged patients experiencing what otherwise was identical with Alzheimer s disease from being diagnosed as having a disease process  rather than simply considered as aging normally  66  Katzmann thus suggested that Alzheimer s disease  if taken to occur over age 65  is actually common  not rare  and was the 4th or 5th leading cause of death  even though rarely being reported on death certificates in 1976  This suggestion opened the view that dementia is never normal  and must always be the result of a particular disease process  and is not part of the normal healthy aging process  per se  The ensuing debate led for a time to the proposed disease diagnosis of  senile dementia of the Alzheimer s type   SDAT  in persons over the age of 65  with  Alzheimer s disease  diagnosed in persons younger than 65 who had the same pathology  Eventually  however  it was agreed that the age limit was artificial  and that Alzheimer s disease was the appropriate term for persons with the particular brain pathology seen in this disease  regardless of the age of the person with the diagnosis  A helpful finding was that although the incidence of Alzheimer s disease increased with age  from 5 10  of 75 year olds to as many as 40 50  of 90 year olds   there was no age at which all persons developed it  so it was not an inevitable consequence of aging  no matter how great an age a person attained  Evidence of this is shown by numerous documented supercentenarians  people living to 110   that experienced no serious cognitive impairment  Also  after 1952  mental illnesses like schizophrenia were removed from the category of  organic brain syndromes   and thus  by definition  removed from possible causes of  dementing illnesses   dementias   At the same  however  the traditional cause of senile dementia   hardening of the arteries    now returned as a set of dementias of vascular cause  small strokes   These were now termed  multi infarct dementias  or vascular dementias  In the 21st century  a number of other types of dementia have been differentiated from Alzheimer s disease and vascular dementias  these two being the most common types   This differentiation is on the basis of pathological examination of brain tissues  symptomatology  and by different patterns of brain metabolic activity in nuclear medical imaging tests such as SPECT and PETscans of the brain  The various forms of dementia have differing prognoses  expected outcome of illness   and also differing sets of epidemologic risk factors  The causal etiology of many of them  including Alzheimer s disease  remains unknown  although many theories exist such as accumulation of protein plaques as part of normal aging  inflammation  inadequate blood sugar  and traumatic brain injury   edit  See also Aging
