Sikh lifestyle as  Naam Japo  Kirat Karni and Wand kay Shako  which means meditate on the holy name  Waheguru   work diligently and honestly  and share one s fruits  27  The guiding principles of the

Mughal ruler Jahangir on 16 May 1606  The martyrdom of Sri Guru Teg Bahadur Ji 9th Guru to protect Hindus from religious persecution  in Delhi  on 11 November 1675 AD  is another example of upholding

distinct of it  It teaches that the God is omnipresent  transcendence  omnipotent  and omniscient  It also revolves around the belief in reincarnation  Emphasis is on ethics  morality  and values  the Sikh faith does not accept miracles  The Sikh school of thought believes in a form of reincarnation similar to Karma  The concept of hell and heaven in Sikhism is metaphorical and is said to be experienced by those who chose  or not  to live in the 5 thieves  Guru Har Gobind Sikhism also believes in an omnipresent Onkar  the one constant in the Universe  Devout Sikhs are recommended to say five prayers in the morning between 1 and 6 am  the five prayers can be said in succession within one hour for the well versed   Japji  Anand Sahib  Jaap Sahib  Tav Prasad Savaiye  Chaupai and Ardas  one prayer in the evening from 5 to 7 pm  Rehras and Ardas  and one before sleeping  around 8 to 10 pm  Kirtan Sohila and Ardas  Sikh scriptures teach the concept of moderation  Sikhism teaches a person to remove the Five Evils  kaam or kam  lust   krodh  wrath   lobh  greed   moh  materialism   and ahankar  egotism   and to oppose hedonism  Guru Nanak sought to improve the status of women by spreading this message   From woman  man is born  within woman  man is conceived  to woman he is engaged and married  Woman becomes his friend  through woman  the future generations come  When his woman dies  he seeks another woman  to woman he is bound  So why call her bad when she gives rise to nobility  From woman  woman is born  without woman  there would be no one at all  O Nanak  only the True Lord is without a woman    page 473   In so doing  he promoted women s rights and equality  a remarkable stance in the 15th century which was actually put into practice by Guru Nanak and the following 9 Gurus  A Nihang at Golden Temple  Amritsar  Sikhism professes democratic institutions such as Guru Paanth  literally the teacher s followers   and decisions about the community are made collectively by the Guru Paanth  Sikhism teaches that all of humanity was created by the Onkar  which is addressed by many names and understood differently  Sikhism teaches to respect all other religions  tolerance  and that one should defend the rights of not just one s own religion but the religion and faith of others as a human right  At the end of every Sikh prayer is a supplication for the welfare of all of humanity  Sikhism believes in the concept of a human Soul  Self  spirituality  or consciousness or spirit or astral body   Sikhs believe they can unite and become one with God in this life  Gurmukh   as the consciousness merges with God  Supreme Consciousness  through truthful living and actions and is only a matter of realization  Sikhs always greet each other with the words  Sat Sri Akaal  which literally means  Truth is Time less being   Truth  truthful living  equality  freedom and justice are the core principles of Sikh philosophy  Guru Gobind Singh infused a new spirit into the community by creating the Khalsa brotherhood   or the  pure brotherhood   Khalsa Sikhs do not cut their hair kes  this being covered with a turban  the idea is that humans are made in the image of God  to honor God  Thus a person s intact hair is a symbol of honor  warriorhood  saintliness and radiance aura and an acceptance of the natural form of our bodies  allowing believers to be at peace with themselves at all times and to get rid of vanity relating to outward appearance  Panj Pyare  leading a procession in Wolverhampton  UK  Wearing a turban and a distinct identity also made the Sikhs very easily recognizable  Sikh history is built on examples of brave men and women who defended an ideology built on the fundamentals of human rights and equality of all human beings  This belief often led to conflict with oppressive authorities  For more than 300 years the Sikhs were persecuted endlessly  The Sikh human rights struggle morphed into a political struggle which was one of the dominant causes of the fall of the Mughal empire in India and led to the formation of the strongest kingdom in India before being annexed by the British in 1849  Yet at the peak of their political power the Sikhs under the great Maharaja Ranjit Singh had a large powerful kingdom centered in Lahore which was also secular and egalitarian  An example of Sikhism s commitment to tolerance is the fact that the foundation stone of the holiest shrine of the Sikhs Harmandir Sahib  Amritsar also known as the Golden Temple was laid not by the many eminent Sikh leaders or the 4th Sikh Guru Ramdas  who was the leader of the Sikhs at that time  but by a Sufi by the name of Sain Mian Mir  The Khalsa code of conduct strictly forbids the use of intoxicants  drugs  alcohol  cigarettes  narcotics and any other foreign substance which disrupts the body  sexual relationship out of marriage  consuming sacrificial meat  Kutha meat   and cutting of hairs  The Sikh religion also teaches that human life is very valuable  described as more precious than a diamond which comes after great spiritual deeds and merits are done  having gone through 8 4 million life cycle of incarnations before human life was attained  Therefore  the meaning of life from Sikh teachings is to unite with the supreme Truth referred to as Onkar  citation needed   edit  Five Ks Main articles  Khalsa and Sahajdhari Kanga  Kara and Kirpan three of the five articles of faith endowed to the Sikhs  The Five Ks  or panj kakaar kakke  are five articles of faith that all baptized Sikhs  also called Khalsa Sikhs  are typically obliged to wear at all times  as commanded by the tenth Sikh Guru  who so ordered on the day of Baisakhi Amrit Sanskar in 1699  The symbols are worn for identification and representation of the ideals of Sikhism  such as honesty  equality  fidelity  militarism  meditating on God  and never bowing to tyranny  33  The five symbols are  Kesh  uncut hair  usually tied and wrapped in the Sikh Turban  Dastar  Kanga  a wooden comb  usually worn under the Dastar  Katchera  specially made cotton underwear as a reminder of the commitment to purity  Kara  an iron bracelet

traditional curved sword  from one to three feet in length   edit  History Main article  History of Sikhism A Sikh Empire warrior s battle helmet Harmandir Sahib Cheering Sikh pilgrims arriving in Manikaran Sikh history  with respect to Sikhism as a distinct political body  can be said to have begun with the death of the fifth Sikh Guru  Guru Arjan Dev in 1606  Sikh distinction was further enhanced by the establishment of the Khalsa           by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699  34  The evolution of Sikhism began with the emergence of Guru Nanak as a religious leader and a social reformer during the 15th century in the Punjab  The religious practice was formalised by Guru Gobind Singh on 30 March 1699  The latter baptised five people from different social backgrounds to form Khalsa  The first five  Pure Ones  then baptised Gobind Singh into the Khalsa fold  35  This gives Sikhism  as an organized grouping  a religious history of around 400 years  Generally Sikhism has had amicable relations with other religions  However  during the Mughal rule of India  1556 1707   the emerging religion had strained relations with the ruling Mughals  Hindu Hill rajahs fought frequent battles against Guru Gobind Singh because they were largely opposed to Guru Gobind Singh s casteless principles of religion  Prominent Sikh Gurus were killed by Mughals for opposing Mughal persecution of minority religious communities  36  Subsequently  Sikhism militarized to oppose Mughal hegemony  The emergence of the Sikh Empire under reign of the Maharajah Ranjit Singh was characterised by religious tolerance and pluralism with Christians  Muslims and Hindus in positions of power  The establishment of the Sikh Empire is commonly considered the zenith of Sikhism at a political level  37  during which time the Sikh Empire came to include Kashmir  Ladakh  and Peshawar  Hari Singh Nalwa  the Commander in chief of the Sikh army along the North West Frontier  took the boundary of the Sikh Empire to the very mouth of the Khyber Pass  The Empire s secular administration integrated innovative military  economic and governmental reforms  The months leading up to the partition of India in 1947 were marked by heavy conflict in the Punjab between Sikhs and Muslims  The effect was the religious migration of Punjabi Sikhs and Hindus from West Punjab  mirroring a similar religious migration of Punjabi Muslims in East Punjab  38  The 1960s saw growing animosity and rioting between Sikhs and Hindus in India  39  as the Sikhs agitated for the creation of a Punjab state based on a linguistic basis similar to that by which other states in India had been created  This had also been promised to the Sikh leader Master Tara Singh by Nehru in return for Sikh political support during the negotiations for Indian Independence  40  Sikhs obtained the Punjab but not without losing some Punjabi speaking areas to Himachal Pradesh and Harayana  worst of all  Chandigarh was made Union Territory and the joint capital of Haryana  amp  Punjab Punjab on 1 November 1966  Communal tensions arose again in the late 1970s  fueled by Sikh claims of discrimination and marginalisation by the Hindu dominated Indian National Congress ruling party and the  dictatorial  tactics adopted the then Indian Prime Minister  Indira Gandhi  41  Frank 41  argues that Gandhi s assumption of emergency powers in 1975 resulted in the weakening of the  legitimate and impartial machinery of government   and her increasing  paranoia  of opposing political groups led her to instigate a  despotic policy of playing castes  religions and political groups against each other for political advantage   As a reaction against these actions  the Sikh leader Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale vocalised Sikh sentiment for justice and advocated the creation of a Sikh homeland  Khalistan  This accelerated in Punjab a state of communal violence  42 Gandhi s 1984 action to defeat Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale led to the attack of the Golden Temple in Operation Bluestar and ultimately led to Gandhi s assassination by her Sikh bodyguards  42  This resulted in an explosion of violence against the Sikh community in the anti Sikh riots which resulted in the massacre of thousands of Sikhs throughout India  Khushwant Singh described the actions as being a Sikh pogrom in which he  felt like a refugee in my country  In fact  I felt like a Jew in Nazi Germany   43  Since 1984  relations between Sikhs and Hindus have moved towards a rapprochement helped by growing economic prosperity  however  in 2002 the claims of the popular right wing Hindu organisation the RSS  which has long played a significant role in protecting Sikhs during riots 44    that  Sikhs are Hindus  angered Sikh sensibilities  45  Many Sikhs still are campaigning for justice for victims of the violence and the political and economic needs of the Punjab espoused in the Khalistan movement  In 1996 the Special Rapporteur for the Commission on Human Rights on freedom of religion or belief  Abdelfattah Amor  Tunisia  1993 2004   visited India in order to compose a report on religious discrimination  In 1997  46  Amor concluded   it appears that the situation of the Sikhs in the religious field is satisfactory  but that difficulties are arising in the political  foreign interference  terrorism  etc    economic  in particular with regard to sharing of water supplies  and even occupational fields  Information received from nongovernment  sic  sources indicates that discrimination does exist in certain sectors of the public administration  examples include the decline in the number of Sikhs in the police force and the military  and the absence of Sikhs in personal bodyguard units since the murder of Indira Gandhi   47   edit  Sikh music and instruments Main article  Sikh music Sikhs have developed their own instruments  Rabab  Dilruba  Taus  Jori and the Sarinda  The Sarangi was also encouraged by Guru Har Gobind  The Rabaab was first used by Bhai Mardana as he accompanied Guru Nanak Dev on his journeys  Jori and Sarinda were both designed by Guru Arjan Dev  The Taus was made by Guru Har Gobind  it is said that he heard a peacock singing and wished to create an instrument that could mimic its sounds  Taus is the Persian word for peacock  The Dilruba was made by Guru Gobind Singh at the request of his Sikhs  They wished for a smaller instrument  since the Taus was hard to carry and maintain  due to constant battles  After Japji Sahib  all of the shabd in the Guru Granth Sahib are written in raag  The shabd is typically played in accordance with that particular raag  This style of singing is known as Gurmat Sangeet  When marching into battle  the Sikhs would use drumming to boost their morale and increase excitement  This was called the Ranjit Nagara  Drum of Victory   Nagaras are large war drums that make a thundering sound and measure about 2 to 3 feet in diameter  they are played with two sticks  The special or original Ranjit Nagara  used in past battles  are up to 5 feet across  The beat of the large drums usually meant that the army was marching into battle  They were also taken into the battle sometimes  the Sikhs would raise the Nishan Sahib high  and the opposing forces would know the Singhs were coming  While the Sikhs  spirit was being boosted  the opposing forces would lose morale   edit  Distribution Main article  Sikh diaspora Chart showing India s total Sikh population and their percentage of the total Indian population

19th century when the British had completed their annexation of the Punjab  38  The British Raj preferentially recruited Sikhs in the Indian Civil Service and  in particular  the British Indian Army  which led to migration of Sikhs to different parts of British India and the British Empire  38  During the era of the British Raj  semiskilled Sikh artisans were also transported from the Punjab to British East Africa to help in the building of railways  After World War II  Sikhs emigrated from both India and Pakistan  most going to the United Kingdom but many also headed for North America  Some of the Sikhs who had settled in eastern Africa were expelled by Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in 1972  51  Subsequently the main  push  factor for Sikh migration has been economic  with significant Sikh communities now being found in the United Kingdom  Canada  the United States  Malaysia  East Africa  Australia and Thailand  Map showing world Sikh population areas and historical migration patterns  Est  2004   52  While the rate of Sikh migration from the Punjab has remained high  traditional patterns of Sikh migration that favoured English speaking countries  particularly the United Kingdom  have changed in the past decade due to factors such as stricter immigration procedures  Moliner  2006  53  states that as a consequence of the  fact  that Sikh migration to the UK had  become virtually impossible since the late 1970s   Sikh migration patterns altered to continental Europe  Italy has now emerged as a fast growing area for Sikh migration  54  with Reggio Emilia and the Vicenza province being areas of significant Sikh population clusters  55  The Italian Sikhs are generally involved in agriculture  agro processing  machine tools and horticulture  56  Due primarily to socio economic reasons  Indian Sikhs have the lowest adjusted decadal growth rate of any major religious group in India  at 16 9  per decade  est  1991 2001   57  Johnson and Barrett 2004  estimate

Indian Sikhs are no different and have been predominately employed in the agro business  India s 2001 census found that 39  of the working population of Punjab were employed in this sector  less than the Indian average   68  The success  in the 1960s  of the Green Revolution  in which India went from  famine to plenty  from humiliation to dignity   69  was based in the Sikh majority state of Punjab  which became known as  the breadbasket of India   70  71  The Sikh majority state of Punjab is also statistically the wealthiest  per capita   with the average Punjabi enjoying the highest income in India  3 times the national Indian average  72  The Green Revolution centered upon Indian farmers adapting their farming methods to more intensive and mechanised techniques  this was aided by the electrification of Punjab  cooperative credit  consolidation of small holdings and the existing British Raj developed canal system  73  Swedish political scientist  Ishtiaq Ahmad  states that a factor in the success of the Indian green revolution transformation was the  Sikh cultivator  often the Jat  whose courage  perseverance  spirit of enterprise and muscle prowess proved crucial   74  However  not all aspects of the green revolution were beneficial  Indian physicist Vandana Shiva 75  argues that the green revolution essentially rendered the  negative and destructive impacts of science  i e  the green revolution  on nature and society  invisible  thus having been separated from their material and political roots in the science system  when new forms of scarcity and social conflict arose they were linked not to traditional causes but to other social systems e g  religion  Hence Shiva argues that the green revolution was a catalyst for communal Punjabi Sikh and Hindu tensions  despite the growth in material affluence  Punjabi Sikhs are prominent in varied professions  such as scientists  engineers and doctors  notable Punjabi Sikhs include nuclear scientist

migrated to North America  especially the Sikhs who migrated to California s fertile Central Valley  The farming skills of the Sikhs and their willingness to work hard ensured that they rose from migrant labourers to become landowners who control much agriculture in California  American Sikh agriculturists such as Harbhajan Singh Samra and Didar Singh Bains dominate California agriculture and

Raja Bhup Singh became a vassal of Sikh Power  With the Sikh Kingdom of Lahore becoming the paramount power  some of the Pahari painters from Guler migrated to Lahore to enjoy the patronage of Maharaja Ranjeet Singh and his Sardars  The Sikh School of paintings is the adoption of the Kangra Kalam to Sikh needs and ideals  Its main subjects are the ten Sikh gurus and anecdotes from the Janam Sikh  The tenth Guru  Gobind Singh  left a deep impression on the adherents of the new faith because of his unmatched bravery and unparalleled sacrifices  Hunting scenes and portraiture are also common in Sikh painting   edit  Digital library Launched in 2003 under Nanakshahi Trust  the Panjab Digital Library was a result of the early phase of the digital revolution in Punjab  While most saw the Nanakshahi as a small digitisation organisation  or as an assemblage of some unknown youth working towards capturing some manuscripts on their digital cameras  its founders saw it as a cornerstone of a fundamentally new approach to preserving Punjab s heritage for future generations  In the shadow of search engines  a Semantic Web approach thought of in the early 2003 reached maturity in 2006  This was when the organisation planned to expand its operations from a mere three employee organisation to one of the leading NGO s working in the field of digital preservation all over India  Digitised collections include manuscripts held by the Punjab Languages Department  items from the Government Museum and Art Gallery Chandigarh  Chief Khalsa Diwan  SGPC  DSGMC and manuscripts in the Jawahr Lal Nehru Library of Kurukshetra University  It also include hundreds of personal collections  With over 5 million pages digitised it is the biggest repository of digital data on Punjab   edit  Sikhs in the Indian and British Armies French postcard depicting the arrival of 15th Sikh Regiment in France during World War I  The postcard reads   Gentlemen of India marching to chasten the German hooligans   Main article  Sikhs in the Indian and British Armies By the advent of World War I  Sikhs in the British Indian Army totaled over 100 000  i e  20  of the British Indian Army  In the years to 1945  14 Victoria Crosses were awarded to the Sikhs  a per capita record given the size of the Sikh Regiments  63  In 2002  the names of all Sikh VC and George Cross winners were inscribed on the pavilion monument of the Memorial Gates 81  on Constitution Hill next to Buckingham palace  London  82 Lieutenant Colonel Chanan Singh Dhillon was instrumental in campaigning for the memorial building  During World War I  Sikh battalions fought in Egypt  Palestine  Mesopotamia  Gallipoli and France  Six battalions of the Sikh Regiment were raised in World War II  and served at El Alamein and in Burma  Italy and Iraq  winning 27 battle honours  Japanese soldiers shooting blindfolded Sikh prisoners  Across the world  Sikhs are commemorated in Commonwealth cemeteries  83   In the last two world wars 83 005 turban wearing Sikh soldiers were killed and 109 045 were wounded  They all died or were wounded for the freedom of Britain and the world  and during shell fire  with no other protection but the turban  the symbol of their faith    General Sir Frank Messervy 84   British people are highly indebted and obliged to Sikhs for a long time  I know that within this century we needed their help twice  in two world wars  and they did help us very well  As a result of their timely help  we are today able to live with honour  dignity  and independence  In the war  they fought and died for us  wearing the turbans    Sir Winston Churchill 85   edit  Sikhism in the Western world This section may contain parts that are misleading  Please help clarify this article according to any suggestions provided on the talk page  Sikhs celebrating the Sikh new year in Toronto  Canada As Sikhs wear turbans  although different from Middle Eastern turbans  and due to the relatively small number of Sikhs  there have been incidents of Sikhs in Western countries being mistaken for Middle Eastern Muslim men  This has led to mistaken attitudes and acts against Sikhs living in the West especially with respect to the 9 11 terrorist attack and recent Iraq War  86  87  Sikhs are neither Muslims nor from the Middle East  Sikhism is a religion of India  The roots of Sikhism lie in Punjab  India   Sikhs make up 60  to 70  of the total population of Punjab  which is the only region in the world where Sikhs are in the majority  After the 11 September 2001 attacks  some people associated Sikhs with terrorists or members of the Taliban  A few days after the attack  Balbir Singh Sodhi  a Sikh man  was gunned down by Frank Roque  who thought that the victim had ties to al Qaeda  CNN suggested that there has been an increase in hate crimes against Sikh men in the United States and the UK following the 9 11 attack  86  87  Sikhism has never actively sought converts  thus  the Sikhs have remained a relatively homogeneous group ethnically  citation needed  However  mainly due to the activities of Harbhajan Singh Yogi via his Kundalini Yoga focused 3HO  Happy  Healthy  Holy  Organisation  Sikhism has witnessed a moderate growth in non Indian adherents  88  In 1998 it was estimated that these 3HO Sikhs  known colloquially as  gora         or  white  Sikhs  totaled 7 800 89  and were mainly centered around Espa ola  New Mexico and Los Angeles  California  A law in Oregon was passed banning the wearing of turbans by teachers and government officials  Sikhs and the Council on Sikhi Swag worked together in successfully overturning the law  90  In an attempt to foster strong Sikh leaders in the Western world  many youth initiatives have been begun by various organisations  For example  the Sikh Youth Alliance of North America annually organizes the Sikh Youth Symposium  a public speaking and debate competition held in gurdwaras around America and Canada   edit  Art and culture Main article  Sikh art and culture Harmindar Sahib  circa 1870 Sikh art and culture is synonymous with that of the Punjab region  The Punjab itself has been called India s melting pot  due to the confluence of invading cultures  such as Greek  Mughal and Persian  that mirrors the confluence of rivers from which the region gets its name  Thus Sikh culture is to a large extent informed by this synthesis of cultures  Sikhism has forged a unique form of architecture which Bhatti describes as being  inspired by Guru Nanak s creative mysticism  such that Sikh architecture  is a mute harbinger of holistic humanism based on pragmatic spirituality   91  The reign of the Sikh Empire was the single biggest catalyst in creating a uniquely Sikh form of expression  with Maharajah Ranjit Singh patronising the building of forts  palaces  bungas  residential places   colleges  etc   that can be said to be of the Sikh Style  Characteristics of Sikh architecture are gilded fluted domes  cupolas  kiosks and stone lanterns with an ornate balustrade on square roofs  The  jewel in the crown  of the Sikh Style is the Harmindar Sahib  Sikh culture is heavily influenced by militaristic motifs  with Khanda being the most obvious  the majority of Sikh artifacts  independent of the relics of the Gurus  have a military theme  This motif is again evident in the Sikh festivals of Hola Mohalla and Vaisakhi  which feature marching and displays of valor respectively  The art and culture of the Sikh diaspora has merged with that of other Indo immigrant groups into categories such as  British Asian    Indo Canadian  and  Desi Culture   however  there has emerged a niche cultural phenomenon that can be described as  Political Sikh   92  The art of prominent diaspora Sikhs such as Amarjeet Kaur Nandhra  amp  Amrit and Rabindra Kaur Singh   The Singh Twins    93  is informed by their Sikhism and the current affairs of the Punjab  Bhangra and the Gidha are two forms of indigenous Punjabi folk dancing that have been appropriated  adapted and pioneered by Punjabi Sikhs  The Punjabi Sikhs have championed these forms of expression all over the world  resulting in Sikh culture becoming inextricably linked to Bhangra  even though  Bhangra is not a Sikh institution but a Punjabi one   94   edit  Notable Sikhs in the modern era Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with US
