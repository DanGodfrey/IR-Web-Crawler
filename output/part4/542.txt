v t e The history of the United States from 1991 to present began after the fall of the Soviet Union which signaled the end of the Cold War and led to the United States  heightened military involvement in the Middle East  The U S  expelled an Iraqi invasion force from Kuwait  a Middle Eastern ally of the U S   in the 1991 Gulf War  Trailing the early 1990s recession  the Democrats returned to the White House with the election of Bill Clinton in 1992  In the 1994 midterm election the Republicans gained control of Congress for the first time in 40 years  Strife between Clinton and the Republicans in Congress initially resulted in a federal government shutdown following a budget crisis  but later they worked together to pass welfare reform  the Children s Health Insurance Program  and a balanced budget  Charges from the Lewinsky scandal led to the 1998 impeachment of Clinton by the House of Representatives but he was later acquitted by the Senate  The U S  economy boomed in the enthusiasm for high technology industries in the 1990s until the NASDAQ crashed as the dot com bubble burst and the early 2000s recession marked the end of the sustained economic growth  In 2000  Republican George W  Bush was elected president in one of the closest and most controversial elections in U S  history  Early in his term  his administration approved education reform and a large across the board tax cut aimed at stimulating the economy  Following the September 11 attacks in 2001  the U S  embarked on the War on Terror  starting with the 2001 war in Afghanistan  In 2003  the U S  invaded Iraq  which deposed the controversial regime of Saddam Hussein but also resulted in a prolonged conflict that would continue over the course of the decade  The Homeland Security Department was formed and the controversial Patriot Act was passed to bolster domestic efforts against terrorism  In 2006  criticism over the handling of the disastrous Hurricane Katrina  which struck the Gulf Coast region in 2005   political scandals  and the growing unpopularity of the Iraq War helped the Democrats gain control of Congress  In 2007  President Bush ordered a troop surge in Iraq  which ultimately led to reduced casualties  The collapse of the housing bubble  which led into the late 2000s recession  helped the Democrats gain the presidency in 2008 with the election of Barack Obama  The government enacted large loans and economic stimulus packages aimed at improving the economy  Obama s domestic initiatives also included the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  which made large reforms to the American healthcare system  President Obama eventually withdrew combat troops from Iraq  and shifted the country s efforts in the War on Terror to Afghanistan  where a troop surge was initiated there in 2009  In 2010  due to continued public discontent with the economic situation  unemployment  and federal spending  Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives and reduced the Democratic majority in the Senate  In 2011  Obama announced that al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed by U S  forces during a covert operation in Pakistan  The Iraq War was declared formally over in 2011  Contents 1 Globalization and the new economy 1 1 Dot com bubble 2 Conflicts 2 1 First Iraq War 2 2 Conflicts in Somalia  Bosnia  Kosovo  and the Middle

this period  The six years span of 1994 through 2000 witnessed the emergence of what many commentators called a technology driven  new economy   and relatively high increases in real output  low inflation rates  and a drop in unemployment to below five percent  The Internet and related technologies made their first broad penetrations into the economy  prompting a Wall Street technology driven bubble  which Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan described in 1996 as  irrational exuberance   1  After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991  the United States was the world s dominant military power and Japan  sometimes seen as the largest economic rival to the U S   was caught in a period of stagnation  citation needed China was emerging as the U S  s foremost trading competitor in more and more areas  citation needed  Localized conflicts such as those in Haiti and the Balkans prompted President Bill Clinton to send in U S  troops as peacekeepers  reviving the Cold War era controversy about whether policing the rest of the world was a proper U S  role  Islamic radicals overseas loudly threatened assaults against the U S  for its ongoing military presence in the Middle East  and even staged the first World Trade Center attack  a truck bombing in New York s twin towers  in 1993  as well as a number of deadly attacks on U S  interests abroad  Immigration  most of it from Latin America and Asia  swelled during the 1990s  laying the groundwork for great changes in the demographic makeup of the U S  population in coming decades  such as Hispanics replacing African Americans as the largest minority  Despite tougher border scrutiny after the September 11 attacks  nearly 8 million immigrants came to the United States from 2000 to 2005 more than in any other five year period in the nation s history  2  Almost half entered illegally  3   edit  Dot com bubble Main article  Dot com bubble Early 2000 to 2001 saw the dramatic bursting of the dot com bubble  Excitement over the prospects of Internet stocks had led to huge increases in the major indexes  On March 10  2000 the NASDAQ peaked at 5 048 62  4  more than double its value just a year before  The massive initial batch of sell orders processed on Monday  March 13 triggered a chain reaction of selling that fed on itself as investors  funds  and institutions liquidated positions  In just six days  the NASDAQ had lost nearly nine percent  falling to 4 580 on March 15  The poor results of Internet retailers following the 1999 Christmas season may have been first unequivocal and public evidence that the  Get Rich Quick  Internet strategy was flawed for most companies  These retailers  results were made public in March when annual and quarterly reports of public firms were released  By 2001  the bubble was deflating at full speed  A majority of the dot coms ceased trading after burning through their venture capital  many having never made a profit   edit  Conflicts  edit  First Iraq War Main article  Gulf War U S  military aircraft flying over Iraq during the Gulf War The considerable dependence of the industrialized world on oil  with much of the proved oil reserves situated in Middle Eastern countries  became evident to the U S   first in the aftermath of the 1973 world oil shock and later in the second energy crisis of 1979  Although in real terms oil prices fell back to pre 1973 levels through the 1980s  resulting in a windfall for the oil consuming nations  especially North America  Western Europe  and Japan   the vast reserves of the leading Middle East producers guaranteed the region its strategic importance  By the early 1990s the politics of oil still proved as hazardous as it did in the early 1970s  Conflict in the Middle East triggered yet another international crisis on August 2  1990  when Iraq invaded and attempted to annex neighboring Kuwait  U S  officials feared that Hussein was then on the verge of armed conflict with oil rich Saudi Arabia  a close ally of Washington s since the 1940s  The United Nations condemned the invasion as an act of aggression  Bush compared Hussein to Adolf Hitler and declared that if the United States and international community did not act  aggression would be encouraged elsewhere in the world  The Security Council gave Iraq a deadline to leave Kuwait  but Saddam Hussein ignored it  and the Security Council authorized a military response  The war began in January 1991  with U S  troops forming the majority of the coalition which participated in Operation Desert Storm  By the time Iraqi troops withdrew from Kuwait in late February  Iraq had lost approximately 20 000 troops  with some sources citing as many as 100 000 casualties on the Iraqi side   edit  Conflicts in Somalia  Bosnia  Kosovo  and the Middle East An American helicopter flies over the Somalian coast during the Battle of Mogadishu  part of U S  involvement in Somalia in the early 1990s  In December 1992  President Bush sent troops to join the UN Operation Restore Hope  a multi national effort to restore order and provide humanitarian aid in Somalia  which was torn by civil war  famine  and warlords  By the summer of 1993  the situation had deteriorated  After 24 Pakistani soldiers were killed in June 1993  the UN passed a resolution calling for the arrest and trial of those responsible for the attack  Under the leadership of newly elected President Bill Clinton  U S  forces launched a concentrated attack on Aidid s stronghold in Mogadishu in Operation Gothic Serpent  In October 1993  19 soldiers were killed and 84 were wounded in the Battle of Mogadishu  After the attack  Clinton ordered U S  forces withdrawn from the region  with the last being withdrawn by 1995  and fired his Secretary of Defense Les Aspin who had not sent adequate forces  5  In the mid 1990s  the United States was involved in the Bosnian War through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  NATO   most notably the 1995 bombing campaign  which finally led to the Dayton Agreement which ended the war by the end of 1995  In late 1998  the region became volatile again as war erupted between the army of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Kosovo Liberation Army  a guerrilla group  A 1999 NATO bombing campaign struck Yugoslavia  resulting in the deaths of hundreds of Yugoslavian soldiers and civilians  As a result  Yugoslavia withdrew from Kosovo and Kosovo became an independent state  6  President Clinton also presided over cruise missile strikes on Iraq in 1996 and bombing attacks on Iraq in 1998  which were launched in response to Saddam Hussein s violation of several UN resolutions  including repression of ethnic minorities  Kurds  and removing UN weapons inspectors  The 1998 campaign  in particular  was meant to de stabilize the Iraqi government and degrade the power of Hussein  Clinton also signed the Iraq Liberation Act to appropriate funds to Iraqi opposition groups in the hopes of overthrowing Hussein s regime and establishing democracy  Throughout the 1990s  the United States also played an active role in peace efforts in the Israeli Palestinian conflict  President Clinton  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin  and Palestinian Prime Minister Yasser Arafat met and the Oslo Accords were signed in 1993  which called for the gradual ceding of control of Palestinian areas to the Palestinians in exchange for peace  However  Rabin was assassinated in 1995 and by 2000  the Camp David Summit failed to yield a new agreement when Arafat rejected new Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak s 95  offer  which would give Palestine control of 95  of their territories with the condition that refugees that had fled Palestine since 1948 cannot return  Arafat never made a counter offer  In the 2000s  decade   under the leadership of President George W  Bush  Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon  and Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas  peace talk efforts continued with the new  road map for peace   7   edit  Early al Qaeda attacks 1993 began a series of increasingly high profile attacks associated with al Qaeda  a radical muslim militant organization led by Osama bin Laden  On February 26  1993  a truck bomb was detonated at the World Trade Center in New York City  killing 6 and injuring over 1000  The attack was intended to destroy the foundation of the North Tower  knocking the tower into the South Tower  which would destroy both buildings and kill thousands of people  While this did not happen  the bomb caused considerable damage to the lower levels of the North Tower  In 1994  four men were convicted of carrying out the bombing and in 1997  two men were convicted for their roles  including the truck driver and the mastermind  Ramzi Yousef  On June 25  1996  al Qaeda terrorists bombed the Khobar Towers  a complex in Saudi Arabia where members of the U S  military were being housed  killing 19 American servicemen and injuring over 300  Al Qaeda bombed the U S  Embassy in Kenya on August 7  1998  killing 224 people  including 12 Americans  The U S  launched cruise missile strikes on a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan  yet this failed to destroy al Qaeda s vast network  In October 2000  al Qaeda militants bombed the USS Cole off the coast of Yemen  killing 17 servicemen and severely damaging the ship  8   edit  September 2001 attacks Main article  September 11 attacks President Bush addresses rescue workers at Ground Zero in New York  September 14  2001   I can hear you  The rest of the world hears you  And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon   On the morning of September 11  2001  four airliners were hijacked  two of them were flown into the World Trade Center towers in New York City and another into the Pentagon in Arlington  Virginia  destroying both towers and taking just under 3 000 lives  The fourth plane crashed in southern Pennsylvania after some passengers fought back and are believed to have caused the piloting hijackers to crash  The immense shock  grief and anger brought on by the attacks profoundly altered the national mood  it was found that Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda militant network of Islamist insurgents sponsored the attacks and President Bush announced a  war on terror   Congress approved several measures to protect against future attacks  including creating the Department of Homeland Security and passing the USA PATRIOT Act  which was criticized by groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union  The administration s military response was to invade Afghanistan on October 7  2001  targeting al Qaeda and the Taliban government that supported and sheltered them  The U S  was joined by a coalition which included forces from more than a dozen countries  and was successful in removing the Taliban from power  although fighting continues between the coalition and Afghans of various factions  In 2002  the GDP growth rate rose to 2 8   A major short term problem in the first half of 2002 was a sharp decline in the stock market  fueled in part by the exposure of dubious accounting practices in some major corporations  Another was unemployment  which experienced the longest period of monthly increase since the Great Depression  The United States began to recover from the post 9 11 recession in 2003  but the robustness of the market  7  GDP growth   combined with the unemployment rate  above 6    led some economists and politicians to refer to the situation as a  jobless recovery   However  the unemployment rate fell in subsequent years  falling below 5  in 2006   while GDP growth continued  9   edit  Second Iraq War Main article  Iraq War M1A1 Abrams pose for a photo under the  Hands of Victory  in Ceremony Square  Baghdad  Iraq  In his State of the Union address in January 2002  President George W  Bush called Iran  Iraq  and North Korea an  axis of evil   10  The Bush administration later began making a public case for an invasion of Iraq  accusing them of violating the 1991 UN imposed ceasefire  supporting terrorism and being in possession of weapons of mass destruction  later  the latter of these accusations were proved to be false  and the first two are considered very dubious by most historians   11  Some important allies of the U S   including India  Japan  Turkey  New Zealand  France  Germany  and Canada  did not believe that the evidence for the President s accusations was well founded enough to justify a full scale invasion  especially as military personnel were still needed in Afghanistan  The UN Security Council did not approve of the invasion  and the U S  therefore provided most of the forces in the invasion of Iraq  With the support of a coalition whose major partners included the United Kingdom  Australia  Poland  Spain  and Italy  Iraq was invaded on March 20  2003  A graph of U S  troop fatalities in Iraq  The orange months are post troop surge and the blue months are under the Obama administration  After six weeks of combat between the coalition and the Iraqi army  the invading forces had secured control of many key regions  Hussein had fled his palace  his regime clearly over  on May 1  Bush declared  under a sign reading  mission accomplished   that major ground operations were at an end  Saddam Hussein s sons Qusay and Uday were killed by U S  forces  Saddam himself was captured in December 2003 and taken into custody  Nevertheless  fighting with the Iraqi insurgency continued and escalated through the 2004 U S  national elections and beyond  With casualties increasing and the cost of the invasion and reconstruction of Iraq estimated at over  200 billion  the war has lost about one third of its supporters in the U S  since the end of major operations was announced  Contemporary polls suggested that international displeasure with the United States was at an all time high  with a majority of people in Europe believing that the country was too powerful and acted mainly in self interest  and a vast majority in predominantly Muslim nations believing that the United States was arrogant  belligerent  or hateful to Islam  12  As the situation in Iraq became increasingly difficult  policymakers began looking for new options  This led to the formation of the Iraq Study Group  a nonpartisan commission chaired by James Baker and Lee H  Hamilton  This produced a variety of proposals  some of the more notable ones were to seek decreased US presence in Iraq  increased engagement with neighboring countries  and greater attention to resolving other local conflicts  such as the Israeli Palestinian conflict  The recommendations were generally ignored  and instead  Bush ordered a surge of troops to Iraq in 2007 and 2008  Violence in the country declined in 2008 and 2009  and the U S  combat role ended in August 2010  U S  forces were withdrawn in large numbers in 2009 and 2010  and the war was declared formally over in December 2011  13   edit  Domestic terrorism Aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing The 1990s and 2000s  decade  became known for several incidents of domestic terrorism  usually perpetrated by those dissatisfied with actions of the federal government  big business  or other aspects of American society  Throughout the 1970s and 1980s  a mysterious man known in the media as the  Unabomber  sent mail bombs to figures in the academic and airline industries for various reasons  After a lull  he began another mail bombing campaign in earnest  beginning in 1993  His targets expanded to include big businesses such as representatives of the timber and oil industries  Two people were killed in the mid 1990s and an exhaustive and expensive investigation by the FBI coupled with intense national media interest in the story resulted in the identification and arrest of the perpetrator Theodore Kaczynski  who was sentenced to life in prison  On April 19  1995  a truck bomb was detonated outside the Alfred P  Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City  Oklahoma  killing 168 people and injuring over 600  The bombing became the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in the United States and led to sweeping reforms in United States federal building security  The attack s perpetrator  Timothy McVeigh  was an anti government extremist who used the Waco Siege and Ruby Ridge incidents as justification for his retaliation against the federal government  14  While McVeigh wanted to specifically target federal agents  the bombing killed many innocent civilians  including 19 children  McVeigh was executed in 2001 and his accomplice Terry Nichols was sentenced to life in prison  In July 1996  in the midst of the 1996 Summer Olympics at Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta  Georgia  a homemade bomb was detonated  resulting in the deaths of 2 people and injuring over 100  This was followed by similar attacks at two abortion clinics and a lesbian nightclub  In 2003  suspect Eric Robert Rudolph was arrested and sentenced in 2005 to five life sentences for these attacks  In 2001  only days after the September 11 attacks  letters laced with anthrax were sent to several individuals  including prominent news personalities and government officials  The letters killed 5 people and infected a further 17  This incident of bioterrorism was initially blamed on international terrorist organization al Qaeda  but in 2008  was determined to stem from a Maryland scientist by the name of Bruce Edward Ivins  who committed suicide before he could be prosecuted   edit  Crime and violence A makeshift memorial in tribute to the victims of the Northern Illinois University shooting  one of many school shootings that afflicted the United States  In the early 1990s  the U S  violent crime rate reached its peak before a steady decline began around 1993  Nevertheless  the ongoing drug problem  involving sales of marijuana and cocaine  continued to be a major factor in crime in the United States  The overall rate of major crimes fell during the period  In 2009  the FBI estimated 1 318 000 violent crimes occurred nationwide  which was 7 5  below the 2000 level of 1 425 000 and 31  below the 1991 level of 1 912 000  15  In 1992  the Los Angeles riots occurred after four Los Angeles police officers were acquitted in the beating of black motorist Rodney King  The riots occurred primarily in South Central Los Angeles  a predominantly black and Hispanic area  Over 50 people were killed and 2000 were injured  Two prominent examples of the carnage were Reginald Denny and Fidel Lopez  who were nearly beat to death by savage mobs  3 600 fires were set  destroying over 1 000 buildings and widespread looting occurred  especially of businesses owned by the Korean American community  In all  nearly  1 billion in damage was caused  Then president George H  W  Bush denounced the rioting and worked with the Governor of California Pete Wilson and Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley to restore order  A curfew was established and 4 000 National Guardsmen were deployed  in addition to law enforcement agents and fire service personnel from several agencies  16  In the 1990s and 2000s  decade   a surge of hate crimes against the lesbian  gay  bisexual  and transgender community occurred in the United States  The most publicized incident was the murder of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming after two young men kidnapped  tortured  and murdered him near the University of Wyoming in 1998  Despite public awareness  many American gay youths continued to experience bullying among their peers  and some were even driven to suicide  Organizations such as the It Gets Better Project and the Trevor Project were created to help LGBT youths  In 2009  Congress passed the Matthew Shepard Act which extended the hate crime law to women  the disabled  and gays  lesbians  bisexuals  and transsexuals  A spate of school shootings rocked the country in the late 1990s and 2000s  decade   the deadliest and most prominent of which were the Westside Middle School massacre  1998   the Columbine High School massacre  1999   the Red Lake High School massacre  2005   the Amish school shooting  2006   the Virginia Tech massacre  2007   and the Northern Illinois University shooting  2008   These shootings added fuel to the fire for the debates over gun politics and media violence  and led to increased focus on mental health  school safety  and anti bullying  The Capital Region was struck by the Beltway sniper attacks  a series of sniper attacks on civilians and federal workers by two gunmen over a month long period in October 2002  The attackers killed 10 people and injured three  The suspects  John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo  were taken into custody on October 24  2002 and sentenced a year later  Muhammad was executed in 2009 and Malvo received six life sentences  17  In November 2009  U S  Army major Nidal Malik Hasan killed 13 fellow servicemen and injured 30 in the Fort Hood shooting in Killeen  Texas  While the act was called terrorism by some due to Hasan s Muslim heritage  the attack was ruled out by the FBI to have been perpetrated by a terrorist organization  On January 8  2011  U S  Representative Gabrielle Giffords was the target of an assassination attempt  when a gunman went on a shooting spree  critically injuring Giffords  killing federal judge John Roll and five other people  and wounding at least 14 others  at a  Congress on Your Corner  event Giffords was hosting in suburban Tucson  Arizona   edit  Disasters  edit  Natural disasters On August 24  1992  the category five Hurricane Andrew made landfall in South Florida  devastating the southern suburbs of Miami  including Homestead  Kendall  and Cutler Ridge  Two days later  the storm made landfall again in a sparsely populated part of Louisiana  with relatively less damage than in Florida  The storm killed 26 people directly  39 indirectly  With  26 billion in damage  it became the costliest storm in history at that time  The storm was known for many controversies including the sluggish federal response  which may have impacted President George H W  Bush s image on domestic issues  as well as poor housing construction which may have led to such high levels of destruction  Satellite image of the  Storm of the Century  In March 1993  a massive storm  known as the  Storm of the Century  or  Superstorm  struck the Eastern Seaboard of the United States  The storm set low pressure records  produced hurricane force winds  storm surge  and killer tornadoes in Florida  and produced snowfall up to 2 feet  61 cm  across many portions of the Eastern United States  The storm was particularly crippling to the Southern United States  where places like Birmingham  Alabama received one and a half feet of snow and record low temperatures  highly unusual for the region  In all  300 deaths were attributed to the storm and  6 billion in damage was caused  The Great Flood of 1993 affected the Midwestern United States in the spring and summer of that year  devastating large portions of the Mississippi and Missouri River Valleys and their tributaries  Many small towns were devastated and agricultural losses were significant  10 000 homes were destroyed and 15 million acres  61 000 km2  of agricultural lands were inundated  50 people perished in the floods and  15 billion in damage was done  In the early morning hours of January 17  1994  the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles was hit by a 6 7 magnitude earthquake  known as the  Northridge earthquake   The quake killed more than 70 people and injured 9 000  Most of the fatalities were attributed to collapsed buildings  parking structures  or freeways  Striking an urban area  it was very destructive  causing  20 billion in damage  In July 1995  the city of Chicago was hit by a heat wave that had severe repercussions  During a five day spell from July 12 to July 16  the high temperature hovered from the mid 90s to the mid 100s  The heat index pushed 120 degrees on many days  The heat wave resulted in the deaths of over 700 people  many of whom were black  elderly  or poor  The event brought increased attention to these segments of the population and the importance of reaching out to them during heat waves  as well as the concept of the urban heat island effect  in which urban environments exacerbate heat and humidity levels  Additionally  power failures and lack of adequate warning and general preparedness aggravated the situation and may have contributed to such high fatalities  In January 1996  the Blizzard of 1996 affected the Northeastern and Mid Atlantic United States  dumping up to 36 inches  91 cm  of snow on many areas  crippling major American cities like Washington  D C   Baltimore  Philadelphia  New York City  and Boston  The storm killed 150 people and caused  3 billion in damages  On May 3  1999  a violent tornado outbreak struck the Southern Great Plains  predominantly Oklahoma  The most destructive tornado was an F5 tornado that struck Oklahoma City and the suburb of Moore  The tornado is one of the most prominent examples of a tornado striking a major urban area and became the first tornado to incur over  1 billion in damages  In all  the outbreak resulted in 50 deaths and over 600 injuries  In 2004  four hurricanes  Charley  Frances  Ivan  and Jeanne  struck the state of Florida in a one month timespan  resulting in over 100 U S  deaths and nearly  50 billion in damage combined  Out of the four hurricanes  Ivan was the deadliest in the U S   while Charley was the most destructive  Flooding due to Hurricane Katrina 2005 brought the most active Atlantic hurricane season in recorded history  In August 2005  the powerful Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast region  Katrina broke the levees of New Orleans  Louisiana and flooded 80  of the low lying city  Extensive devastation and flooding also occurred from Mobile  Alabama west to Beaumont  Texas  with the Mississippi coastline especially hard hit  At least 1 800 lives were lost in the worst domestic calamity since the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane  Port facilities  oil rigs and refineries in the Gulf region were damaged  further increasing already high U S  fuel prices  Residents of New Orleans  many of whom were impoverished and unable  or unwilling  to evacuate before the storm  were trapped for days by the flood waters  Tens of thousands had to be rescued by the U S  military from their rooftops or from unsanitary and dangerous shelters in public buildings  State and local authorities were overwhelmed by the scale of the events  Their response to the disaster  as well the federal government s  were harshly criticized by legislators and citizens who saw in the confusion a dangerous lack of readiness and inability to preserve public safety  President Bush promised that the federal government would underwrite the rebuilding of New Orleans and other storm damaged areas  the cost of which was estimated to run as high as  200 billion  Only weeks after Katrina  Hurricane Rita struck the Texas Louisiana border in September  Rita caused the largest evacuation in U S  history  as millions of people fled the Houston area  as well as portions of Louisiana  Rita resulted in over 100 fatalities  the vast majority of which were indirect  occurring during the evacuation or in the aftermath of the storm  Additionally   10 billion in damage was attributed to Rita  Later in the season  Hurricane Wilma struck the state of Florida in October 2005  killing 35 people and doing  20 billion worth of damage  The storm yielded the lowest pressure value ever recorded in history before making landfall in Florida  making it the most intense storm on record  On Super Tuesday in February 2008  in the midst of heated primary elections in multiple states  a destructive tornado outbreak hit the Mid South region  spawning dangerous nighttime twisters across the region  A total of 87 tornadoes were reported  Over 60 people were killed across Tennessee  Kentucky  Arkansas  and Alabama and hundreds were injured  Losses exceeded  1 billion  The outbreak was the deadliest outbreak in the U S  in 23 years  and brought renewed attention to the dangers of nighttime tornadoes  winter tornadoes  and the vulnerability of populations in the Southern United States  In September 2008  after two straight years of not being affected by a serious hurricane  Hurricane Gustav caused  18 billion in damage in Louisiana  and a few weeks later  the Galveston  Texas and Houston  Texas areas were devastated by Hurricane Ike with over  31 billion in damage  making Ike the third most destructive hurricane ever to hit the United States behind Hurricanes Andrew and Katrina  Over 100 people were killed  The hurricanes also caused gas prices to spike to around  4 per gallon  In the spring of 2011  several major tornado outbreaks affected the Central and Southern United States  43 people were killed in a tornado outbreak from April 14 16  18  19  Approximately 350  people were killed in a tornado outbreak from April 25   April 28  the deadliest U S  tornado outbreak in 75 years  since the 1936 Tupelo Gainesville tornado outbreak   20  21  22  23  States particularly hit hard by the outbreaks included Oklahoma  Arkansas  Mississippi  Tennessee  Georgia  North Carolina  Virginia  and most especially  Alabama  which sustained over 250 fatalities alone  The latter outbreak produced  10 billion in damage  making it the costliest tornado outbreak in history  24  On May 22  an EF5 tornado devastated Joplin  Missouri  killing 154  injuring over 1 000 people  and causing  1 3 billion in damage  making it the deadliest single U S  tornado in 64 years and the costliest single tornado of all time  25  26  In August 2011  Hurricane Irene was the first hurricane to make landfall since Ike in 2008  striking the Eastern Seaboard of the United States  making landfalls in North Carolina  New Jersey  and New York  The storm killed at least 45 people and caused  10 billion in damage  The storm was particularly notable for its extensive flooding in the Northeast  and a couple days later  Tropical Storm Lee made landfall in Louisiana  its remnants tracking to the Northeast for even more devastating floods   edit  Other disasters The Deepwater Horizon oil rig burns after exploding in April 2010  The disaster led to the largest oil spill in U S  history  Notable aviation disasters in the 1990s included TWA Flight 800 crashing off the coast of Long Island  en route to Paris  France  on July 17  1996 due to an explosion of the fuel tank  killing 230 and EgyptAir Flight 990 crashing south of Nantucket  Massachusetts  en route to Cairo  Egypt  on October 31  1999 due to deliberate crashing by the first officer  killing 217  Shortly after the 9 11 terrorist attacks  the second deadliest U S  aviation incident occurred when American Airlines Flight 587 crashed in Queens  New York  en route to the Dominican Republic  on November 12  2001 due to overuse of rudder controls by the pilot to counteract turbulence  killing 265  including 5 on the ground   On February 1  2003  the Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated upon re entry to the Earth over parts of Texas and Louisiana during STS 107  resulting in the deaths of all seven astronauts  The incident resulted from a piece of foam insulation that fell off during launch  which struck the shuttle  creating a hole that allowed hot gases to penetrate the shuttle during re entry  In the aftermath of the disaster  the space shuttle program was suspended for 29 months as NASA investigated the incident and made plans to prevent future tragedies  On February 17  2003  a stampede occurred at the E2 nightclub in Chicago  after an incident involving pepper spray  resulting in the deaths of 21 people  Three days later  on February 20  100 people perished and over 200 were injured in The Station nightclub fire in West Warwick  Rhode Island  when pyrotechnics ignited flammable sound proofing during a performance by the band Great White  Both incidents brought attention to the need to crack down on building  fire  and safety code violations to prevent future tragedies  A porch collapse that killed 13 and seriously injured 57 in June 2003 in Chicago further emphasized the problems with building code violations in the United States  On August 1  2007  the I 35W Mississippi River bridge in Minneapolis collapsed into the Mississippi River  killing 13 people and injuring over 50  The bridge was under construction at the time  The incident brought to attention the need to inspect and rehabilitate the aging infrastructure system in the United States  On April 20  2010  an off shore oil drilling rig  the Deepwater Horizon  exploded and burned off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico  Dozens of workers fled the flames and were rescued by lifeboats and helicopters  however 11 were killed and 17 were injured in the incident  The rig burned for 36 hours before sinking  On April 24  it was discovered that a damaged wellhead was leaking oil into the Gulf of Mexico at a rapid rate  For approximately 90 days  tens of thousands of barrels of oil leaked into the ocean every day  resulting in the largest oil spill in United States history  The wellhead was successfully contained in mid July  stopping the flow  and efforts are ongoing to cap the wellhead and create a replacement well  Despite significant efforts to protect coastlines  the spill has had devastating impacts on the environment and the economies of the Gulf Coast states  The Obama administration has ordered rig owner BP responsible for all cleanup costs  which are expected to run in the tens of billions of dollars  The spill has resulted in negative public approval ratings of the U S  government  the Obama administration  and BP  for their handling of the spill  with BP suffering the worst ratings   edit  Energy issues US energy consumption 1980 2008  with projections to 2035 27  After 1970 the U S  began importing oil  as consumption kept rising and the nation s oil fields became less productive  Throughout the 1990s the world price of crude oil range between  10 and  40  and the average price at the pump did not exceed  1 40  Oil prices tripled after 2002  peaking at  147 in July 2008  about  4 dollars a gallon  the price has continued to fluctuate widely  28  The theme of  energy independence  led to legislation mandating more fuel efficient autos even electric vehicles and more efficient use of energy  ranging from insulation to new light bulbs  Even worse than the high price  was the fear of shortages  Many proposals and pilot projects for replacement energy sources  from ethanol to wind power and solar power were discussed and  indeed  funded by Congress after 2000  29  In the economic stimulus package signed by President Obama in early 2009  billions of dollars were allocated for research and development of new energy sources  While public attention focused on supplies from the Middle East  the main source was actually Canada  After 2007  new methods of extraction opened up vast new deposits of oil in the Bakken Formation in North Dakota and Montana  As much as two trillion dollars worth of natural gas is potentially available in the Marcellus Formation deposits located in the historic 19th century oil fields in Appalachia  stretching from West Virginia through Pennsylvania into western New York  However  there is sharp debate underway regarding the environmental impact on the region s fresh water supply  30  The question of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  ANWR  was highly controversial  as Republican proposals were blocked by the Democrats in Congress  31  Republicans in 2008 were campaigning for more offshore drilling  with the slogan  drill  baby  drill   but the 2010 Gulf oil spill put all new drilling on hold   edit  Politics  edit  The Clinton administration Main article  Presidency of Bill Clinton President Clinton s First Cabinet  1993 Riding high on the success of the first Gulf War  George H  W  Bush enjoyed very high approval ratings as president  However  economic recession and a reneged campaign pledge dogged Bush  sinking his formerly high approval ratings from the high 80s to the lower 40s and upper 30s  In the wake of Bush s political problems  Bill Clinton won the 1992 contest with 43  of the vote in a three way race against Bush s 38   Independent candidate Ross Perot tapped the discontent of the electorate with both parties  drawing roughly evenly from both candidates 32  to receive a record 19  of the popular vote  but no electoral votes  Perot s result qualified his Reform Party to receive Federal Election Commission matching funds for campaign contributions in the 1996 election  thus laying the groundwork for another three way race during the 1996 presidential election  Clinton entered office as one of the youngest presidents in U S  history and the first of the Baby Boom Generation to reach the White House  Promising to focus on and resolve some of the United States  many domestic issues  he entered office with high expectations  Immediately  however  he was troubled by controversy over the personal backgrounds of some of his appointees and by political clashes stemming from his announcement that he would permit homosexuals to serve in the U S  military  The latter resulted in the  don t ask  don t tell  policy of the military  These events in 1993 seemed to set the pattern for a man who would become one of the more divisive U S  presidents  regarded with great affection by some and abhorrence by others  citation needed  One early domestic victory of the Clinton administration was the enactment of the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban  The ban was widely decried by the Republican Party  who allowed it to lapse in 2004 while they controlled both Congress and the presidency  33  Bill Clinton s proposal of a national health care system  championed by his wife Hillary Rodham Clinton  34  ignited a political firestorm on the right  which vigorously opposed it on the general principle that government size should be reduced not expanded  The proposed system did not survive the debate  34  However Hillary Clinton did succeed  along with a bipartisan coalition of members of congress  in establishing the Children s Health Insurance Program   edit  The Republican Congress Newt Gingrich  Speaker of the House  1995 1999 The New Deal  the Great Society  and Watergate helped solidify Democratic control of Congress  but the 1980s and early 1990s were a period of fragmentation of their coalition  when the popularity of Democratic incumbents as constituent servants masked growing disenchantment with Congress  governing capacities  Democrats suddenly lost control of the House and the Senate for the first time in four decades in the 1994 midterm elections  Once in power  House Republicans  led by Newt Gingrich  faced the difficulty of learning to govern after forty years as the minority party while simultaneously pursuing their  Contract with America   which they unveiled on the steps of Congress on September 27  1994  Year by year  polarization grew in Washington between the president and his adversaries on the right  citation needed  There was a surge in the market of new media outlets that gave more voice to the right  Rush Limbaugh s radio talk show was a spectacular success and a major influence in the GOP legislative victory  citation needed The Weekly Standard was formed in 1995 and after the election of George W  Bush would advertise itself as the most read publication in the White House  These new media amplified the ever louder quarrels  causing some who   to speak of a new  culture war  in U S  politics  The more extreme says who   right wing voices  which veered into uncompromising hostility toward the Federal government particularly after the botched ATF raid on the Branch Davidians in Waco  Texas  were somewhat discredited  says who   however  after the Oklahoma City bombing  in April 1995  by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols  Remarks including response to Monica Lewinsky scandal  January 26  1998  Bill Clinton making a presentation that ends with a short commentary on the Monica Lewinsky scandal  The presentation is known for the quote  I did not have sexual relations with that woman  Miss Lewinsky    6 07   The audio only version of this speech can be found here  Problems listening to this file  See media help  Along with strong backing from traditional Democrats and liberals  Clinton was able to garner the support of moderates who   who appreciated his centrist  New Democrat  policies  which steered away from the expansion of government services of the New Deal and Great Society and allowed him to  triangulate   taking away many of the Republicans  top issues  One example of such compromises was welfare reform legislation signed into law in 1996  The new law required welfare recipients to work as a condition of benefits and imposed limits on how long individuals may receive payments  but did allow states to exempt 20  of their caseloads from the time limits  Clinton also pursued tough says who   federal anti crime measures  steering more federal dollars toward the war on drugs  and calling for the hiring of 100 000 new police officers  Compromise came with difficulty  though  as the parties failed to agree on a budget  causing the federal government to shut down in late 1995 into early 1996  By the end of his administration  the federal government had experienced the country s longest economic expansion and produced a budget surplus  The first year of the budget surplus was also the first year since 1969 in which the federal government did not borrow from the Social Security Trust Fund  Clinton was reelected in 1996  defeating Republican Senator Bob Dole and Reform Party candidate Ross Perot  who did not repeat the success of his 1992 campaign  Many voters in 1992 and 1996 had been willing to overlook long standing rumors of extramarital affairs by Clinton  deeming them irrelevant  These matters came to a head  however  in February 1998 when reports surfaced of ongoing sexual relations between Clinton and a White House intern  Monica Lewinsky  Clinton initially and vigorously denied the relationship   I did not have sexual relations with that woman  Miss Lewinsky   35  His wife Hillary described the allegations as fraudulent smears dredged up by a  vast right wing conspiracy   36  Clinton was forced to retract his assertions in August 1998 after the Lewinsky matter came under investigation by independent counsel Kenneth Starr  who had been looking into Clinton s involvement in the Whitewater controversy for several years  Since Clinton s denials had extended to a deposition before Starr s office  impeachment proceedings began in the House against the President on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice  The matter climaxed as Clinton was impeached in the United States House of Representatives  but acquitted at his trial by the U S  Senate  37  A public backlash occasioned Newt Gingrich to resign after a poor showing in the 1998 midterm elections  His heir apparent  Speaker elect Bob Livingston  was forced to resign from Congress before impeachment proceedings began due to a confirmed report of his extramarital affairs  After the impeachment trial  a scandal weary and embarrassed U S  public seemed largely satisfied to have the matter resolved  citation needed  In 1999  Republican Dennis Hastert of Illinois became Speaker of the House  a position he would hold until 2007  making him the longest serving Republican Speaker of the House   edit  The George W  Bush administration Main article  Presidency of George W  Bush George W  Bush speaks at a campaign rally in 2004  Though his 2000 election had been the focus of intense controversy which led eventually to a U S  Supreme Court ruling in Bush v  Gore where the court ruled 5 4 in the former s favor by siding with the State of Florida s official vote count  George W  Bush was sworn in as President on January 20  2001  This made the 2000 election the third presidential election in which the electoral vote winner did not receive at least a plurality of the popular vote  Early in his term  Bush signed a controversial  1 3 trillion federal tax cut aimed at revitalizing the economy  but also led to federal budget deficits  Other laws enacted in his first term included the No Child Left Behind Act education reform bill in 2002  the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2003 and the Medicare Prescription Drug  Improvement  and Modernization Act in 2004  The first eight months of his term in office were relatively uneventful  however  it had become clear by that time that the economic boom of the late 1990s was at an end  The year 2001 was plagued by a nine month recession  witnessing the end of the boom psychology and performance  with output increasing only 0 3  and unemployment and business failures rising  On September 11  2001  al Qaeda terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners and attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the September 11 attacks  killing nearly 3 000 and injuring over 6 000 people  Osama bin Laden claimed responsibility for the attacks  President Bush ordered all flights grounded and U S  airspace remained closed for the rest of the week  An emergency bailout package for the airline industry was passed  and stocks fell dramatically when markets re opened the following week  In response to the attacks  the Bush administration and Congress passed the controversial USA PATRIOT Act  aimed at enhancing security  and established the Department of Homeland Security  a mass consolidation of many federal agencies charged with investigation  intelligence  and emergency management  A new Terrorist Finance Tracking Program monitored the movements of terrorists  financial resources but was discontinued after being revealed by The New York Times  38  Telecommunication usage by known and suspected terrorists was studied through the NSA electronic surveillance program  On October 7  2001  the United States invaded Afghanistan as part of a global War on Terrorism  aimed at rooting out al Qaeda  the Taliban  and other terrorist organizations  39  In 2003  Bush launched the War in Iraq on March 20  2003  under controversial grounds that Saddam Hussein s regime had weapons of mass destruction  Bush announced on May 1  2003 from an aircraft carrier that major combat operations in Iraq were completed  with a  Mission Accomplished  banner serving as a backdrop  However  support for the invasion declined as a guerilla war led by the Iraqi insurgency would continue for the remainder of the decade  resulting in the deaths of over 4 000 U S  troops  and it was later shown that Iraq never possessed weapons of mass destruction as the Bush administration claimed  Late in 2003  Hussein was captured  and was subsequently put to trial before the Iraqi people and executed in 2006  Meanwhile  the economy recovered from the early 2000s economic recession  with GDP growth rising to 7  in the middle of 2003  with continued growth through the mid 2000s  The unemployment rate peaked at 6  in 2003  before falling in 2004 and 2005  and dropping below 5  in 2006 and 2007  9  George W  Bush was re elected in November 2004  defeating Democratic contender John Kerry in the electoral vote  and receiving 50 7  of the popular vote against John Kerry s 48 3   Republicans also made gains in both houses of Congress  Some major acts in Bush s second term included the Energy Policy Act of 2005  the Safe  Accountable  Flexible  Efficient Transportation Equity Act  and the Troubled Asset Relief Program  After seeing high approval ratings for much of his first term  40  41  Bush s popularity plummeted to record lows in his second term  due to his handling of the prolonged Iraq war  Hurricane Katrina  and the 2008 financial crisis  Bush was succeeded on January 20  2009 by a Democratic president  Barack Obama   edit  The Democratic Congress Nancy Pelosi  the first female Speaker of the U S  House of Representatives  2007 2011 Democrats swept to victory in the 2006 elections  making Nancy Pelosi Speaker of the United States House of Representatives  the first woman in that position  and electing record numbers of women and minorities  Upon winning the elections  the Democrats drew up a 100 Hour Plan of policy proposals upon assuming power in Congress  Major components of the plan included a pay as you go plan for reducing the deficit  enacting the 9 11 Commission recommendations  increasing the federal minimum wage to  7 25 an hour  allowing the government to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies to secure lower drug prices for Medicare patients  and ending large tax subsidies for big oil companies to help foster energy independence  42  The 110th Congress did little to change the Iraq War except to pass a non binding resolution against President Bush s troop surge  In addition  the House passed a  124 billion emergency spending measure for war funding with the stipulation of a phased troop withdrawal  President Bush vetoed the bill because of the proposal of scaling down forces  making this the second veto of his term  During the months of May June 2007  Ted Kennedy and other senators co sponsored the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007  The purpose of this bill called for immigration reform under the intent of bringing amnesty and citizenship  On June 28 the Senate voted 53 45 for cloture  with 60 votes needed  spelling the end to the 2007 Immigration Bill   edit  Financial crisis and recession Federal reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told a federal commission in November 2009   As a scholar of the Great Depression  I honestly believe that September and October of 2008 was the worst financial crisis in global history  including the Great Depression   Of the 13 most important U S  financial institutions   12 were at risk of failure within a period of a week or two   43  The Federal Reserve and the Treasury cooperated by pouring trillions into a financial system that had frozen up worldwide  They rescued many of the large financial corporations from bankruptcy   with the exception of Lehman Brothers  which went bankrupt   and took government control of insurance giant AIG  mortgage banks Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  and both General Motors and Chrysler  44  In October 2008  Bush sought  and Congress passed  the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008  commonly referred to as the  bank bailout   with the goal of protecting the U S  financial system from complete collapse in the wake of the late 2000s recession  which brought significant declines in the stock market  The bill provided federal government guarantees of up to  700 billion to troubled financial institutions through the Troubled Asset Relief Program  TARP   By 2010  only a fraction of that money was ever spent  as banks were able to quickly repay loans from the federal government or ended up never needing the money  Meanwhile unemployment doubled to nearly 10   with states such as California and Michigan especially hard hit  While the stock market rebounded by 2011  and corporate profits had recovered  unemployment remained over 9  into 2011  The recession was worldwide  with Europe and Japan hard hit  while China  India and Canada fared much better   edit  The Obama administration Obama sworn in as the 44th President of the United States Main articles  United States presidential election  2008 and Presidency of Barack Obama The nation went into the 2008 election cycle having a Republican president 45  and Democratic congress 46  both with extremely low approval ratings  The presidential elections saw the Republican John McCain  the senior Senator from Arizona  with his running mate Sarah Palin  the Governor of Alaska  run against the Democrat Barack Obama  the junior Senator from Illinois  with Joe Biden  the senior Senator from Delaware  The economic crisis of 2008 escalated in the late stages of the campaign and doomed McCain  47  On November 4  2008  Obama defeated McCain to become the 44th President of the United States  making history in becoming the first African American to be elected to the highest executive office  Obama and Biden were inaugurated on January 20  2009  Part of the strong showing came from a surge of support from younger voters  African Americans  Hispanics and independents  Democrats made further gains in Congress  adding to the majorities they had won in 2006  48  Obama s early policy decisions addressed a continuing global financial crisis 49  and have included changes in tax policies  foreign policy initiatives and the phasing out of detention of prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba  50  In response to the deepening recession  Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009  a bill aimed at stimulating the economy which provided  787 billion in federal funds for tax relief  as well as significant investments in infrastructure improvements  social welfare programs  education programs  healthcare  and housing  Other legislative achievements during his term include the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which made sweeping reforms to the U S  healthcare system  the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which implemented several new financial regulations to prevent another major financial crisis  and the Don t Ask  Don t Tell Repeal Act  In foreign policy  President Obama withdrew U S  troops from Iraq in large numbers  bringing the Iraq War to an end in December 2011  At the same time  he also increased troop levels in the Afghanistan War  51  Early in his presidency  he successfully negotiated the New START treaty with Russia  which made significant reductions in their nuclear arsenals  The U S  also maintains ongoing talks  led by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton  with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program  as well as with Israel and the Palestinian Authority over a two state solution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict  In May 2011  President Obama announced in a televised speech to the nation that al Qaeda leader and culprit behind many deadly acts of terrorism  including the September 11 attacks  Osama bin Laden was killed by U S  forces at a compound in Abbottabad  Pakistan  In the 2010 elections  the GOP regained control of the House and reduced the Democratic majority in the Senate  52  53  due to voters  continued frustration with the economy  high unemployment  and rising federal debt  54  Under the new Congress  which had a Republican House and a Democratic Senate  President Obama and Congress clashed for months over whether or not to raise the debt ceiling and whether or not to extend the payroll tax cuts for middle income citizens that Obama signed into law  After months of heated debate  the debt ceiling was ultimately raised and the tax cuts extended  However  Obama s approval ratings continued to hover at around 46   55  while Congress had an even lower approval rating of 11   56   edit  See also Timeline of United States history  edit  Notes   Greenspan  Alan
