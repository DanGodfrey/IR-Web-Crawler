Tonight Show  airing them on either Saturday or Sunday night  at local affiliates  discretion   originally known as The Saturday Sunday Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson   In 1974  Johnny Carson announced that he wanted the weekend shows pulled and saved so that they could be aired during weekdays  allowing him to take time off  5  NBC president Herbert Schlosser approached his vice president of late night programming Dick Ebersol in 1974 and asked him to create a show to fill the Saturday night timeslot  Schlosser and Ebersol then approached Lorne Michaels  wanting to create a variety show that would push the boundaries with its edgy style of humor  Ebersol knew Michaels was capable of creating a show since he had worked on Rowan  amp  Martin s Laugh In  The show was set  and Michaels searched for people to join the staff  He hired Dan Aykroyd  John Belushi  Chevy Chase  George Coe  Jane Curtin  Garrett Morris  Laraine Newman  Michael O Donoghue  and Gilda Radner to the cast  Originally  the show was called NBC s Saturday Night  as Saturday Night Live was in use by Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell on the rival network ABC  6  NBC purchased the rights to the name in 1976 and officially adopted the new title on March 26  1977  7  The show was an instant hit following its debut  and as a result  the cast members became suddenly famous  Chase left the show during the second season and was replaced by a new and upcoming comic named Bill Murray  Aykroyd and Belushi left the show after season four  In 1980  after season five  Michaels  emotionally and physically exhausted  requested to put the show on hiatus for a year to give him time to pursue other ideas  8  Concerned that the show would be cancelled without him  Michaels suggested writers Al Franken and Tom Davis take his place  but then NBC president Fred Silverman disliked Franken  and after Franken performed  Limo for a Lame O   a scathing critique of Silverman s presidency  Silverman was furious at Franken  and blamed Lorne for approving the sketch   9  Unable to get the deal he wanted  Michaels chose to leave NBC for Paramount Pictures  intending to take his associate producer Jean Doumanian with him  Michaels later learned that Doumanian had been given his position at SNL after being recommended by her friend  NBC vice president Barbara Gallagher  10  Michaels  departure led to most of the cast and writing staff leaving the show  11  The reputation of the show as a springboard to fame meant many aspiring stars were eager to join the new series  Doumainan was tasked with hiring a full cast and writing staff in less than three months  and NBC immediately cut the show s budget from the previous  1 million per episode down to just  350 000  Doumainan faced resentment and sabotage from the remaining Michaels staff  particularly males who did not appreciate a woman believing she could take Michael s place  12  The season was a disaster  ratings plummeted and audiences failed to connect to the original casts  replacements like Charles Rocket and Ann Risley  13  but her fate was sealed when  during a sketch  Rocket said  fuck  on live television  14  After only ten months Doumainan was fired  13  15  Although executives suggested SNL be left to die  Network chief Brandon Tartikoff wanted to keep the show going  believing the concept was more important to the network than money  Tartikoff turned to Ebersol  who had been previously fired by Silverman  16  Ebersol gained Michaels  blessing in an attempt to avoid the same staff sabotage that had blighted Doumanian s tenure  17   He  Lorne Michaels  put me on TV  and no one else would have done that  Lorne created a show that s impacted culture for over 35 years  No one has ever really successfully been able to replicate it      Tina Fey on how Michaels  has been influential in comedy  18  Ebersol s tenure saw commercial success but was considered lackluster compared to the Michaels era  apart from the breakout of cast member Eddie Murphy  19  Murphy  the main draw of the cast  left in 1983 to pursue his already successful film career  and Ebersol decided to again rebuild the cast  breaking with history by hiring established comedians like Billy Crystal  Martin Short  and Harry Shearer who could bring their already successful material to the show  20  Ebersol s final year with this new cast is considered one of the funniest of the series  but had strayed far from the precedent shattering show that Michaels had created  21  After that season  Ebersol wanted a more significant revamp  including departing from the show s established  live  format  citation needed  Following unsuccessful forays into film and television  in need of money  and eager not to see Tartikoff cancel the show  22  Michaels finally returned in 1985 after Ebersol opted not to  The show was again recast  with Michaels borrowing Ebersol s idea  and seeking out established acts like Joan Cusack and Robert Downey  Jr   23  The cast and writers struggled creatively  and in April 1986  Tartikoff made the decision to cancel the show  until he was convinced by Bernie Brillstein to give it one more year  24  The show was renewed but for the first time in its history  for only thirteen episodes instead of the usual twenty two  25  Michaels again fired most of the cast and  learning his lesson from the previous seasons  sought out unknown talent like Dana Carvey and Phil Hartman instead of known names  25  The show ran successfully again until it lost two of its biggest stars  Carvey and Hartman  between 1992 and 1994  Wanting to increase SNL s profitability  then NBC West Coast president Don Ohlmeyer and other executives began to actively interfere in the show  recommending that new stars like Chris Farley and Adam Sandler be fired  and the show faced increasing criticism from the press and cast  in part encouraged by the NBC executives hoping to weaken Michaels  position  26  Michaels  return restored an association with NBC that has lasted nearly 30 years  As head of Broadway Video and SNL Studios  Michaels has profited from the talent he s helped introduce  producing the TV series Late Night  during the eras of Conan O Brien and Jimmy Fallon   both SNL alumni   30 Rock  a comedy created by former SNL head writer Tina Fey  and loosely based on her experiences in that role   and Up All Night  starring fomer SNL cast member Maya Rudolph  Michaels also produced the TV film All You Need Is Cash  and a lengthy list of feature films based on SNL sketches  the most commercially and critically successful of these was Wayne s World  27   edit  Cast and crew  edit  Cast A photo of the original cast of SNL  From left to right  Laraine Newman  John Belushi  Jane Curtin  Gilda Radner  Dan Aykroyd  Garrett Morris and Chevy Chase Main article  Saturday Night Live cast members The original 1975 cast of SNL  officially known on air as  The Not Ready For Prime Time Players   28  a term coined by writer Herb Sargent  29  included Laraine Newman  John Belushi  Jane Curtin  Gilda Radner  Dan Aykroyd  Garrett Morris and Chevy Chase  Radner was the first person hired after Michaels himself  Although Chase became a performer  he was hired on a one year writer contract  and refused to sign the performer contract that was repeatedly given to him  allowing him to leave the show after the first season in 1976  30  Newman was brought aboard after having a prior working relationship with Michaels  31  Morris was initially brought in as a writer  but attempts to have him fired by another writer led Michaels to have Morris audition for the cast  where he turned in a successful performance  32  Curtin and Belushi were the last two cast to be hired  31  Belushi held a disdain for television and had repeatedly turned down offers to appear on other shows  but decided to work with the show because of the involvement of Radner  and writers Anne Beatts and Michael O Donoghue  33  Michaels was still reluctant to hire Belushi  believing he would be a source of trouble for the show  but Beatts  O Donoghue  and Ebersol successfully argued for his inclusion  33  After Chase left the show  he was replaced by Bill Murray who Michaels had intended to hire for the first season cast  but was unable to due to budget restrictions  34  When Chase returned to host in 1978  he found the remaining cast resentful at his departure and his success  particularly Belushi  Murray  goaded by the rest of the cast  and Chase came to blows shortly before the show  35  Chase s departure for film made Michaels possessive of his talent  he threatened to fire Aykroyd if he took the role of D Day in the 1978 comedy Animal House  and later refused to allow SNL musician Paul Shaffer to participate in The Blues Brothers  1980  with Aykroyd and Belushi after they left in 1979 to pursue film careers  36  37  Michaels began to struggle to hold the remaining cast together in the wake of Chase  Aykroyd  and Belushi s independent successes  Radner had a one woman Broadway show and Murray starred in the 1979 comedy Meatballs  38  In 1980  when Michaels chose to leave the series to pursue other interests  he was followed by the remaining original cast  Curtin  Newman  and Morris  Murray  and additional cast members  37  The Doumainan era cast faced immediate comparison to the beloved former cast and were not received favorably  13  Ebersol fired the majority of her hires  except for two unknown comedians  Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo  39  Talent coordinator Neil Levy claimed Murphy contacted and pleaded with him for a role on the show  and after seeing him audition  Levy fought with Doumainan to cast him instead of Robert Townsend  Doumainan wanted only one black cast member and favored Townsend  but Levy convinced her to choose Murphy  Doumainan however also claimed credit for discovering Murphy and fighting with NBC executives to bring him onto the show  40  Even so  Murphy would languish as a background character until Ebersol took charge  41  after which Murphy was credited with much of that era s success  42  Murphy s star exploded  and he quickly appeared in films like 48 Hrs  and Trading Places  before leaving for his film career in early 1984  Much of the Ebersol cast departed after the 1983 1984 season and were replaced with established comedians who could supply their own material  but at an inflated cost  Billy Crystal and Martin Short were paid  25 000 and  20 000 respectively  a far cry from earlier salaries  20  Michaels  return in 1985 saw a cast reset that featured established talent like Robert Downey Jr   Jon Lovitz  and Dennis Miller  43  The season was poorly received  and another reset followed in 1986  Learning his lesson from the previous season  Michaels avoided known talent in favor of actual ability  He spared Lovitz  Miller  and Nora Dunn  and brought in new  untested talent like Dana Carvey  Phil Hartman  and Jan Hooks  who together would define a new era on the show into the early 1990s  44  The cast continued on for the next decade with the addition of new talent like Mike Myers  Adam Sandler  and Chris Farley  but by 1995  Carvey  Hartman  and Myers had left  and increasing network pressure forced Michaels to fire Sandler and Farley  45  The show saw its next major overhaul  bringing in a new cast including Will Ferrell  Tina Fey  and Jimmy Fallon  45  As of 2012  SNL has featured more than 118 cast members including Rachel Dratch  Amy Poehler  Chris Rock  David Spade  Will Forte  Julia Louis Dreyfus  Tracy Morgan  Chris Parnell  and Maya Rudolph  Darrell Hammond is the longest serving cast member  having been a part of the cast for fourteen years between 1995 and 2009  46  Those selected to join the cast of SNL are normally already accomplished performers  recruited from improvisational comedy groups such as The Groundlings  Ferrell  Hartman  47  Lovitz  and Kristen Wiig 48   and The Second City  Aykroyd  Farley  Fey  49  and Tim Meadows   or established stand up comedians  Carvey  Sandler  Rock  and Norm MacDonald   who already possess the training or experience necessary for SNL  50  Of the many roles available in the show  one of the longest running  and most coveted  is being the host of  Weekend Update   a segment which has alternated between having one or two hosts  and which allows the cast members involved to perform as themselves and be on camera for an extended period of time  51  Many of the  Weekend Update  hosts have gone on to find greater success outside of the show  including  Chase  Murray  51  Miller  MacDonald  52  Fey  51  Fallon  53  and Poehler  Since 2008  Seth Meyers has been the solo host of  Weekend Update   having previously co hosted with Poehler since 2006  51  As of the 2011 2012 season  the cast is divided into two tiers  the more established group of repertory players  and newer  unproven cast members known as featured players  who may eventually be promoted to the repertory stable  The show s current cast is listed below  54  Current Repertory players Current Featured players

Cast were often contracted from anywhere between five and six years to the show  55  56  but starting with the 1999 2000 season  new hires were tied to a rewritten contract that allowed NBC to take a cast member in at least their second year and put them in a NBC sitcom  Cast are given the option of rejecting the first two sitcom offers but must accept the third offer  with the sitcom contract length dictated by NBC and potentially lasting up to six years  56  The move drew criticism from talent agents and managers who believed that a cast member could be locked into a contract with NBC for twelve years  six on SNL and then six on a sitcom  The contract also optioned the cast member for three feature films produced by SNL Films  a company owned by NBC  Paramount Pictures  and Michaels  The new contracts were reportedly developed after many previously unknown cast  like Myers and Sandler  gained fame on SNL only to leave and make money for other studios  56  In a 2010 interview  Wiig was reported to be contracted to SNL for a total of seven years  57  The contracts also contain a network option which allows NBC to remove a cast member at any time  58  In the first season of the show  cast were paid  750 per episode  rising to  2 000 by season 2  and  4 000 by season 4  59  By the late 1990s  new cast members received a salary between  5 000 56  and  5 500 per episode  58  increasing to  6 000 in the second year and up to  12 500 for a cast member in their fifth year  58  Performers could earn an additional  1 500 per episode for writing a sketch which made it to air

season and becoming the single head writer as of the 2008 2009 season  61  The  Weekend Update  segment has its own dedicated team of writers led by head writer and producer Alex Baze as of the 2011 2012 season  62  63  Scenes on  Weekend Update  that involve members of the cast acting in character alongside the host are often written by staff writers outside of the dedicated team whom know those characters better  63  SNL writers are often also performers or experienced in writing and improvisational comedy  Many are hired from similar backgrounds such as The Groundlings  Second City  Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre  and ImprovOlympic  37  Experienced writers with backgrounds in television shows are also sometimes brought into the SNL writing room  Like the SNL cast that step before the cameras  many of the writers have been able to find their own success outside the show such as O Brien  who was brought into SNL from The Groundlings  went on to writing for The Simpsons  and eventually began hosting his own show  64  and former head writer Adam McKay who  along with performer Ferrell  founded the successful comedy website Funny or Die  65  In 2000  Fey became the first female SNL head writer 66  67  and successfully transitioned into starring on the show  68  as well as writing and starring in feature films  69  70  71  and ultimately creating and starring in her own show 30 Rock partly based on her SNL experiences  72  In 2005  Fey was being paid  1 5 million per season for her dual role as head writer and performer  73   edit  Announcer Don Pardo served as the announcer for the series when it first began  74  and has continued in the role for all but season 7 between 1981 1982  when Michaels had left and Mel Brandt and Bill Hanrahan filled the announcing role  In 2004  Pardo announced that he would step down from his position  but then continued in the role before again announcing his retirement in 2009  but then continue into the 2009 2010 season  74  In 2010  then 92 year old Pardo was reported to be again considering his retirement  but as of the 2011 2012 season he remains as the announcer  Apart from a brief period in 2006 in which Pardo pre recorded his announcements at his home in Arizona  he has flown to New York City to perform his announcing duties live  74  Cast member Darrell Hammond also periodically impersonated Pardo and fulfilled his announcing duties when Pardo was unavailable  75   edit  The SNL Band Main article  Saturday Night Live Band The Saturday Night Live Band  also known as  The Live Band   is the house band for SNL  Academy Award winning composer Howard Shore served as the first musical director  from 1975 to 1980  appearing in many musical sketches  including Howard Shore and His All Nurse Band and  backing a U  S  Coast Guard chorus  Howard Shore and the Shore Patrol  Over the years  the band has featured several New York studio musicians including Paul Shaffer  1975 1980   Lou Marini  1975

trumpet  and a rhythm section featuring two keyboards  a guitar  bass  drums  and an extra percussionist  not a permanent part of the band until Valerie Naranjo s arrival in 1995  The 1983 1984 and 1984 1985 seasons featured the smallest band  a six piece combo  The band plays instrumentals leading in and out of station breaks  affiliates who run no advertising during these interludes hear the band play complete songs behind a Saturday Night Live bumper graphic until the program resumes  76   edit  Hosts and musical guests Main article  List of Saturday Night Live guests A typical episode of SNL will feature a single host chosen for their popularity  novelty  or because they had a film  album or other work releasing near the time of their show appearance  77  The host delivers the opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast  Traditionally the host of the show ends the opening monologue by introducing the musical guest for the night  Comedian George Carlin was the first to host SNL in the debut October 1975 episode  78  three episodes later  Candice Bergen became the first female host 79  and the first to host more than once  80  Hosts have been drawn from a wide spectrum of backgrounds  from actors  such as Danny DeVito  Buck Henry  and John Goodman 77   to musicians  like George Harrison  81  and Dolly Parton  82  to political activist Ralph Nader  77  Guests that have hosted five or more times are sometimes referred to as belonging to the Five Timers Club  a term that originated on a sketch performed on Tom Hanks  fifth episode  As of September 24  2011  actor Alec Baldwin holds the record for most times hosting  having performed the duty on sixteen different occasions since 1990  Baldwin took the record from actor Steve Martin who has hosted fifteen times since 1976  83  Each episode also features a musical guest  a solo act or a band  who will perform two to three musical numbers  Occasionally  the musical guest has also simultaneously served as the host  Michaels does not allow musical guests to perform using lip synching tracks  84  believing it diminishes the live aspect of the show  Exceptions are only made when the musical act is focused on intense dance routines instead of vocals  where it is difficult to be both heavily physically active and sing simultaneously  85  A 1975 performance by pop group ABBA was the first and only act to feature lip synching  84  until the controversial performance of Ashlee Simpson in 2004   edit  Production GE Building  30 Rockefeller Plaza  or  30 Rock   where the show is filmed  edit  The studio Since the show s inception  SNL has aired from Studio 8H  located on floors 8 and 9 of the GE Building  30 Rockefeller Plaza  or  30 Rock    The studio had previously been used as a radio soundstage for Arturo Toscanini and his NBC Symphony Orchestra  86  Michaels was originally left aghast upon inspecting Studio 8H in 1975  finding it technically limited  outdated  and in need of repair  87  lacking the capacity to host a live show  86  Michaels demanded that NBC executives rebuild the studio and improve the acoustics to accommodate the intended musical acts  86  at a cost of approximately  300 000  86  During the summer 2005 shooting hiatus  crews began renovations on Studio 8H  With its thirty first season premiere in October 2005  the show began broadcasting in high definition television  appearing letterboxed on conventional television screens  Three of the first four shows of the 1976 77 season were shot at the former NBC Studios in Brooklyn  due to NBC News using Studio 8H for Presidential election coverage  88  The offices of SNL writers  producers  and other staff can be found on the 17th floor of  30 Rock   89   edit  Post production With onsite facilities housed on floors 8 and 17 of Rockefeller Plaza  post production duties on live broadcasts of Saturday Night Live include the mixing of audio and video elements by the Senior Audio Mixer  coupled with additional audio feeds consisting of music  sound effects  music scoring and pre recorded voiceovers  All sources are stored digitally  with shows captured and segregated into individual elements to reorganise for future repeats and syndication  The production tracking system was migrated from primarily analogue to digital in 1998  with live shows typically requiring 1 5 Terabytes of storage  consisting of audio elements and 5 cameras worth of visual elements  90  Elements of Saturday Night Live that are pre recorded  such as certain commercial parodies  SNL Digital Shorts  and show graphics are processed off site in the post production facilities of Broadway Video  91  92   edit  Filming and photography Studio 8H production facilities are maintained by NBC Production Services  Video camera equipment includes four Sony BVP 700 CCD cameras  and two Sony BVP 750 CCD handheld cameras  both using Vinten pedestals  A GVG 4000 3 digital component production switcher  and GVG 7000 digital component routing switcher are used to route visual feeds to the control room  with multiple digital and analogue video recorders used to store footage  Graphics are provided by a Chyron Infinit  character generator and a Quantel PictureBox  Audio facilities consist of a Calrec T Series digitally controlled analogue mixing console  and a Yamaha digital mixing console used for tape playback support and utility audio work  93  As of 2009  the opening title sequence and opening montage is shot using the Canon EOS 5D Mark II and Canon EOS 7D digital SLR cameras  Typical elements are recorded at 30 fps  with slow motion sequences shot at 60 fps  both in full 1080p high definition  94  Edie Baskin was the original SNL photographer  hired after Michaels had seen her photographs of Las Vegas and other work  Baskin helped create the opening title sequence for the show by taking photos of New York City at night  95  The first episode used publicity photos of Carlin as transitional bumpers between the show and commercial breaks  the second episode used photos Baskin had already taken of then host Paul Simon  It was then that Michaels suggested that Baskin photograph the hosts for the bumpers instead of using publicity photos  beginning a tradition which continues today  96  Since 1999  Mary Ellen Matthews has been the official photographer of SNL  responsible for devising distinctive photo layouts and aesthetics for still imagery used on the show  Matthews creates photo portraits of the hosts and musical guests of each episode which are used as commercial bumpers  The limited time frame between the host s involvement in the production process and the Live show requires Matthews to create makeshift photo studios on site at 30 Rock  with Matthews attempting to shoot the host on Tuesday and the musical guest on Thursday  although the availability of either can mean the photoshoot for both occurs as late as Thursday  97  Matthews employs flattering portrait lighting with hard lights to achieve a Hollywood style  On the lighting  Matthews commented   I think it just helps the image pop off the screen   If you use soft or flat lighting  it becomes not as dimensional   The  classic Hollywood lighting  gives a little more contrast  and if I use edge lights and then light the background  it goes farther and farther back  I try to achieve that depth as much as I can   98  Matthews is also responsible for taking cast photos  behind the scenes images  documenting rehearsals  and promotional photos  As of 2010  she has also been involved in directing videos  including the show title sequence  98   edit  Creating an episode The production process of a typical episode has been documented in several sources including documentaries  interviews  and books  The common elements of the production process  as based on these documents  are as follows  Production on an SNL episode will normally start on a Monday with a free form pitch meeting 99  100  101  between the cast  writers  producers including Michaels  and the guest host  in Michael s office  over two hours  The host is invited to pitch ideas during this meeting  Although some sketch writing may occur on the day  the bulk of the work revolves around pitching ideas  Tuesday is the only day dedicated purely to writing the scripts  100  a process which can extend through the night into the following Wednesday  Writing may not begin until 8pm on the Tuesday evening  99  101  At 5pm on Wednesday  the sketches are read during a round table meeting in the writers room  101  attended by the writers and producers present during the pitch meeting  technical experts such as make up artists  who may be required to realize certain sketch ideas such as those using prosthetics  and other producers  resulting in an attendance of approximately fifty people  102  At this point there may be at least 40 sketch ideas which are read through in turn  lasting upwards of three hours  102  After completion of the read through  Michaels  the head writer  the guest host  and some of the show producers will move to Michaels  office to decide the layout of the show and decide which of the sketches will be developed for air  Once complete  the writers and cast are allowed into Michaels  office to view the show breakdown and learn whether or not their sketch has survived  103  Sketches may be rewritten starting the same day  100  but will certainly commence on Thursday  work focuses on developing and rewriting the remaining sketches  99  and possibly rehearsals  101  If a sketch is still scheduled beyond Thursday  it is rehearsed on Friday or Saturday 100  before moving to a rehearsal before a live audience at 8pm  again on Saturday before the live show  99  101  After the rehearsal  Michaels will review the show lineup to ensure it meets a 90 minute length  and sketches that have made it as far as the live rehearsal may be removed  104  This often results in less than two days of rehearsal for the eight to twelve sketches that have made it to the stage that they may appear on the live broadcast  99  The opening monologue  spoken by the guest host  is given low priority and can be written as late as Saturday afternoon  105  According to an interview with Fey in 2004  the three to four member dedicated  Weekend Update  writing team will write jokes throughout the week  The host s  of  Weekend Update  will normally not work with  or read the scripts from  the team until Thursday evening  after the main show sketches have been finalized  The host s  will then work on contributing to the script where necessary  106  107   edit  Broadcast SNL s main stage  seen during rehearsals See also  List of Saturday Night Live

America  other countries have created their own versions of the show  including Spain  Italy and Japan  110  Spain s version of show was short lived  only lasting a few episodes which aired on Thursdays and not Saturdays as the title suggested  This version copied heavily from the American version  in that they did their own versions of sketches that were already done on the original series

and Boston Red Sox  the game entered extra innings  causing that night s broadcast of SNL to be canceled  The show was recorded for the studio audience starting at 1 30 a m  Eastern Time  and broadcast two weeks later with an  apology  by Mets pitcher Ron Darling   He explained that the Mets players had all been happy and excited to win the World Series game  widely considered one of the most memorable in the event s 109 year history  but of course they all had become upset and glum when  in the locker room afterwards  they found out that they had caused the first ever cancellation of SNL  Footage showed the depressed players sadly staring at the locker room floor in shame   The episode scheduled for February 10  2001  hosted by Jennifer Lopez  aired 45 minutes late due to an XFL game  Lopez and the cast were not told they were airing on a delay  118  Michaels was so upset by the delay that the episode was re run a mere three weeks later  and the fledgeling league actually changed the rules in order to speed up play so that no such incident would happen again  119  During Murphy s last season  he negotiated to record a number of extra sketches in September 1983 that featured him and were broadcast in episodes for which he was not available  His last live show was with host Edwin Newman on February 25  1984  120  The January 9  2010  show hosted by Charles Barkley

made a difference in their decision  Barack Obama was the beneficiary of the political content  with 59 percent saying they did in fact cast a vote for the then Democratic nominee  128  However in the

sketches into feature length films  with varying degrees of commercial and critical success  The first foray into film came with the successful Aykroyd and Belushi vehicle  The Blues Brothers  1980   which earned over  115 million on a  27 million budget  135  However  it was the success of Wayne s World  1992  that encouraged Michaels to produce more film spin offs  based on several popular sketch characters  Michaels revived 1970s characters for Coneheads  1993   followed by It s Pat  1994   Stuart Saves His Family  1995   A Night at the Roxbury  1998   Superstar  1999  and The Ladies Man  2000   Some did moderately well  though others did not notably  It s Pat  which did so badly at the box office that the studio which made the film  Touchstone Pictures  owned by The Walt Disney Company  which also owns NBC s rival ABC   pulled it only one week after releasing it  136  and Stuart Saves His Family  with the latter losing  15 million  Many of these films were produced by

Folksmen first appeared on SNL  performing the song  Old Joe s Place  before later appearing in the film A Mighty Wind  The three members of the Folksmen were the same three comedians  Harry Shearer  Michael McKean  and Christopher Guest  who also appeared on the same episode as the rock group Spinal Tap  At the time of the appearance  the 1984 85 season   Shearer and Guest were cast members   edit  Music In 2005  the comedy troupe The Lonely Island  consisting of SNL members Andy Samberg  Akiva Schaffer  and Jorma Taccone  gained national exposure after joining the show and debuting their skit music video  Lazy Sunday   written with fellow cast member Chris Parnell  The song became a surprise hit  138  and convinced Michaels to encourage the troupe to develop more comedy songs  Further successes with songs including  Like A Boss   Jizz in My Pants    I m on a Boat    We Like Sportz    Boombox   and  Dick in a Box  which won an Emmy for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics in 2007

Universal Republic Records who were provided with a license to the SNL songs by NBC and Broadway Video   edit  Other Several programs have documented the behind the scenes events of the show  A 60 Minutes report taped in October 2004 depicted the intense writing frenzy that goes on during the week leading up to a show  with crowded meetings and long hours  The report particularly noted the involvement of the guest host s  in developing and selecting the sketches in which they will appear  Similarly  there has been an A amp E episode of Biography which covered the production process  as well as an episode of TV Tales in 2002 on E   In 2010  Saturday Night  a 94 minute documentary by actor James Franco in his directorial debut  was released which follows the production process of the

Michaels granted Franco access to the process  allowing the project to be expanded  101  In September 2011  ice cream company Ben  amp  Jerry s released a limited edition ice cream called  Schweddy Balls   inspired by a late 1990s sketch of the same name starring Alec Baldwin  Ana Gasteyer and Molly Shannon  141  The ice cream became the fastest selling Ben  amp  Jerry s limited edition flavor  The ice cream was also subject to criticism and boycotts by the One Million Moms organization over the  vulgar  142  name  Some retail chains chose not to sell the flavor  but declined to say if the decision was of their own discretion or based on the One Million Moms boycotts  143  142   edit  Controversies  edit  Censorship In some cases  a sketch was censored in repeat broadcasts  On October 18  1986  Sam Kinison delivered a stand up routine which saw the broadcast sound and picture cut twice  replaced with an image of the previous seasons  cast  The first cutaway occurred when Kinison began asking for the legalization of cannabis and said   You can t get any more pot  If you give us back the pot  we ll forget about the crack   144  The joke violated NBC policy of the time that all references to drugs must be negative  The second  longer cutaway occurred when Kinison made a joke about the crucifixion  with viewers seeing the broadcast cut  returning at the end of Kinison s performance  Kinison had not performed the drug joke during rehearsals  but had performed and been asked to remove the crucifixion joke during the live broadcast  which he failed to do  Although the censorship was applied to the West Coast and later airings  the live show contained the unedited footage  144  In a November 21  1992   Wayne s World  sketch  the characters Wayne and Garth  portrayed by Myers and Carvey  respectively  made fun of Chelsea Clinton  the then 12 year old daughter of the then President elect Bill Clinton   implying that Chelsea was incapable of causing males to  Schwing    This joke was subsequently edited out of all repeats and syndication rebroadcasts of this sketch  145  A portion of Martin Lawrence s February 19  1994  monologue concerning feminine hygiene has been removed from all repeats  replaced with a voice over and intertitles stating that the excised portion     was a frank and lively presentation  and nearly cost us all our jobs   146  In 1995  an Irish Bartender sketch  written by Mohr  was aired  By April 15  1995  during the Saturday rehearsal  Mohr was brought to Michaels  and shown a video of the Irish Bartender act as performed by its creator  Rick Shapiro  Mohr denied any knowledge of Shapiro or his act at the time  but later admitted in his memoir that he had stolen the sketch word for word from Shapiro s work  Shapiro and his manager sued the show and gained an undisclosed settlement which involved the sketch being removed from all reruns of the show  147  In March 1998  a Robert Smigel animated short film   Conspiracy Theory Rock   aired  The short is a scathing political sketch accusing corporations including Disney  FOX  and then owners of NBC General Electric  of developing a media monopoly to manipulate public perception  and conceal questionable actions  The clip aired only once as part of the original SNL episode and was removed from syndicated repeats with Michaels explaining that it  wasn t funny   The clip was eventually released as part of the Saturday TV Funhouse compilation DVD in 2006  148  A sketch involving  butt pregnancy  during the first broadcast of the November 12  2005  episode was replaced with a musical sketch about cafeteria food during the repeat  149  On September 27  2009  Jenny Slate made her SNL debut in a biker babe sketch alongside Wiig and actress Megan Fox  where their characters repeatedly use the word  frickin    During one instance Slate instead accidentally said  fuckin    which was dubbed over with  freakin   for subsequent airings  150  The show was forced by the network to run on a five second delay when controversial comedian Richard Pryor hosted  151   edit  Andrew Dice Clay Andrew Dice Clay was scheduled as host on the May 12  1990  episode  Cast member Nora Dunn immediately announced to the press that she was boycotting the show in protest at Clay s perceived misogynistic  politically incorrect act  doing so without informing Michaels  the cast or most of the crew about her intent  152  The backlash was immediate  casting Clay was compared to the Holocaust by an audience member during an interview with Michaels  153  female members of the cast and crew were harassed by phone and mail for sticking with the show  and metal detectors were installed at the show to enhance security  NBC censors insisted that the episode be placed on a delay to compensate for anything Clay might say on air  154  During the live show  some audience members heckled Clay and were immediately removed by the increased security detail  155  Dunn s contract was already coming to an end  and with one episode left in the season  the staff voted against having her take part in the final episode or return  156 Sin ad O Connor was scheduled to be the musical guest for the episode  but she boycotted the show because of Clay s involvement  forcing the producers to find musical replacements  157   edit  Sin ad O Connor Sin ad O Connor tears a picture of Pope John Paul II apart  On October 3  1992  O Connor was scheduled to appear  performing an a cappella performance of Bob Marley s  War   During the dress rehearsal  O Connor held up a photo of a Balkan child as a protest for child abuse in war before bowing and leaving the stage  which the episodes director Dave Wilson described as a  very tender moment   158  However  during the live show  O Connor altered the  War  lyric  fight racial injustice  to  fight child abuse  as a protest against the cases of sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic Church  She presented a photo of Pope John Paul II while singing the word  evil   before tearing the image into pieces and saying  Fight the real enemy   158  159  NBC had no foreknowledge of O Connor s plan and Wilson purposely failed to use the  applause  button  leaving the audience to sit in silence  Michaels made the decision to allow O Connor to take the stage with the rest of the cast at the end of the show  for which he was later punished  NBC received thousands of irate calls in the aftermath of the incident and protests against O Connor occurred outside of the 30 Rock building  where a steamroller crushed dozens of her tapes  CD s and LP s  158  In the following weeks on SNL  guests Joe Pesci and Madonna both voiced their lack of support for O Connor  158  159  As of 2012  NBC still declines to rebroadcast the sequence with the exception of an interview with O Connor on MSNBC s The Rachel Maddow Show  which aired on April 24  2010  when the clip was aired in full  In reruns the incident is replaced with the dress rehearsal performance  The original episode was made available on volume four of the SNL DVD special Saturday Night Live   25 Years of Music  with an introduction by Michaels about the incident  On February 20  2011  the clip was aired on the SNL special  Backstage  showing footage of the dress rehearsal and live performance side by side  The footage cuts to interviewees during the moment the photo was ripped  citation needed   edit  Rage Against the Machine On April 13  1996  musical guests Rage Against the Machine  RATM  were scheduled to perform two songs  The show was hosted that night by ex Republican presidential candidate and billionaire Steve Forbes  According to RATM guitarist Tom Morello   RATM wanted to stand in sharp juxtaposition to a billionaire telling jokes and promoting his flat tax by making our own statement   160  To this end  the band hung two upside down American flags from their amplifiers  Seconds before they took the stage to perform  Bulls on Parade   SNL and NBC sent stagehands in to pull the flags down  161  Following the removal of the flags during the first performance  the band was approached by SNL and NBC officials and ordered to immediately leave the building  Upon hearing this  bassist Tim Commerford reportedly stormed Forbes  dressing room  throwing shreds from one of the torn down flags  Morello noted that members of the SNL cast and crew  whom he declined to name   expressed solidarity with our actions  and a sense of shame that their show had censored the performance   160   edit  Ashlee Simpson Ashlee Simpson appeared as a musical guest on October 23  2004  Her first performance   Pieces of Me   was performed without incident  but when she began her second song   Autobiography   the vocals for  Pieces of Me  were heard again before she had even raised the microphone to her mouth  Simpson began to do an impromptu jig  and then left the stage  162  During the closing of the show Simpson appeared with the guest host Jude Law and said   I m so sorry  My band started playing the wrong song  and I didn t know what to do  so I thought I d do a hoedown   163  164  On October 25  Simpson called in to the music video show Total Request Live and explained that due to complications arising from severe acid reflux disease  which had previously been seen bothering her in The Ashlee Simpson Show  she had completely lost her voice and her doctor had advised her not to sing  She said that because of the acid reflux  her father wanted her to use a vocal guide track for the performance after Simpson had suffered vocal issues during an earlier rehearsal  85  Simpson stated of the incident   I made a complete fool of myself   According to Simpson  the drummer hit the wrong button  which caused the wrong track to be played  165  Michaels had been unaware of the plan to use lip synching  saying in an interview with 60 Minutes that he would not have allowed it  85  Simpson is the only musical guest to ever walk off stage during a live performance  85   edit  References   Hammill  Geoffrey   Saturday Night Live   The Museum of Broadcast Communications   The Museum of
