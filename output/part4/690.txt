on the southwest  11km long  and Israel on the east and north  51km long  It is about 41 kilometres  25 mi  long  and between 6 and 12 kilometres  4 7 5 mi  wide  with a total area of 360 square kilometres  140 sq mi   It has a 40 km coastline onto the Mediterranean Sea  but has no maritime claims due to Israeli administration  The territory takes its name from Gaza city  its main city and administrative center  The Gaza Strip has a temperate climate  with mild winters  and dry and hot summers  subject to drought  The terrain is flat or rolling  with dunes near the coast  The highest point is Abu  Awdah  Joz Abu  Auda   at 105 metres above sea level  Main resources are arable land  about a third of the strip is irrigated   and recently discovered natural gas  Environmental issues include desertification  salination of fresh water  sewage treatment  water borne disease  soil degradation  and depletion and contamination of underground water resources  The population of Gaza Strip is about 1 7 million people  1  most of them descendants of refugees  One million of the population  as of March 2005  were considered refugees  although the vast majority of them were actually born in the Gaza Strip  2  the older generation fled to Gaza in 1948 as part of the 1948 Palestinian exodus following the 1948 Arab Israeli War  from some parts of Mandate Palestine that became Israel  The population is predominantly Sunni Muslim  With a yearly growth rate of about 3 2   the Gaza strip has the 7th highest population growth rate in the world  3  The Gaza Strip acquired its current boundaries at the cessation of fighting in the 1948 Arab Israeli War  which was confirmed in the Israel Egypt Armistice Agreement on 24 February 1949  4  Article V of the Agreement declared that the demarcation line was not to be an international border  The Gaza Strip continued to be occupied by Egypt  At first Gaza Strip was officially administered by the All Palestine Government  established

based on the principles contained in Article 22 of the draft Covenant of the League of Nations and the San Remo Resolution of 25 April 1920 by the principal Allied and associated powers after the First World War  9  The mandate formalised British rule in the southern part of Ottoman Syria from 1923 1948   edit  All Palestine government On 22 September 1948  towards the end of the 1948 Arab Israeli War  the All Palestine Government was proclaimed in the Egyptian occupied Gaza City by the Arab League  It was conceived partly as an Arab League attempt to limit the influence of Transjordan in Palestine  The All Palestine Government was quickly recognized by six of the then seven members of the Arab League  Egypt  Syria  Lebanon  Iraq  Saudi Arabia  and Yemen  but not by Transjordan  10  It was not recognised by any country outside the Arab League  After the cessation of hostilities  the Israel Egypt Armistice Agreement of 24 February 1949 established the separation line between Egyptian and Israeli forces  and established what became the present boundary between the Gaza Strip and Israel  Both sides declared that the boundary was not to be an international border  The southern border with Egypt continued to be the international border which had been drawn in 1906 between the Ottoman Empire and the British Empire  11  The population of the Gaza Strip had been greatly augmented by an influx of Palestinian refugees who fled from Israel before and during the fighting  Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip or Egypt were issued All Palestine passports  Egypt did not offer the Palestinians citizenship  From the end of 1949  they received aid from UNRWA  During the Sinai campaign of November 1956  the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula were occupied by Israeli troops  International pressure led Israel to withdraw  The government was accused of being little more than a fa ade for Egyptian control  with negligible independent funding or influence  It subsequently moved to Cairo and was dissolved in 1959  by decree of Gamal Abdul Nasser  President of Egypt   edit  Egyptian occupation  1959 1967  Main article  Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt Since the dissolution of the All Palestine Government in 1959  under the excuse of the pan Arabism  Egypt continued to occupy the Gaza Strip until 1967  Egypt never annexed the Gaza Strip  but instead treated it as a controlled territory and administered it through a military governor  12   edit  Israeli occupation  1967 1994 2005  Israel controlled the Gaza Strip again beginning in June 1967  after the Six Day War  During the period of Israeli control  Israel created a settlement bloc  Gush Katif  in the southwest corner of the Strip near Rafah and the Egyptian border  In total Israel created 21 settlements in the Gaza Strip  comprising 20  of the total territory  Besides ideological reasons for being there  these settlements also served Israel s security concerns  In March 1979 Israel and Egypt signed the Israel Egypt Peace Treaty  Among other things  the treaty provided for the withdrawal by Israel of its armed forces and civilians from the Sinai Peninsula  which Israel had captured during the Six Day War  to the 1906 international border  citation needed  The Egyptians agreed to keep the Sinai Peninsula demilitarized  The final status of the Gaza Strip  and other relations between Israel and Palestinians  was not dealt with in the treaty  Egypt renounced all territorial claims to territory north of the international border  The Gaza Strip remained under Israeli military administration until 1994  During that period the military was responsible for the maintenance of civil facilities and services  In May 1994  following the Palestinian Israeli agreements known as the Oslo Accords  a phased transfer of governmental authority to the Palestinians took place  Much of the Strip  except for the settlement blocs and military areas  came under Palestinian control  The Israeli forces left Gaza City and other urban areas  leaving the new Palestinian Authority to administer and police those areas  The Palestinian Authority  led by Yasser Arafat  chose Gaza City as its first provincial headquarters  In September 1995  Israel and the PLO signed a second peace agreement  extending the Palestinian Authority to most West Bank towns  The agreement also established an elected 88 member Palestinian National Council  which held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996  The Palestinian Authority rule of the Gaza Strip and West Bank under the leadership of Arafat suffered from serious mismanagement and corruption scandals  For example  exorbitant bribes were demanded for allowing goods to pass in and out of the Gaza Strip  while heads of the Preventive Security Service apparatus profited from their involvement in the gravel import and cement and construction industries  such as the Great Arab Company for Investment and Development  the al Motawaset Company  and the al Sheik Zayid construction project  13  The Second Intifada broke out in September 2000 with its waves of protest  civil unrest and bombings against Israeli military and civilians  many of them perpetrated by suicide bombers  and the beginning of rockets and bombings of Israeli border localities by Palestinian guerrillas from Gaza Strip  especially from Hamas and Jihad Islami movements  In February 2005  the Israeli government voted to implement a unilateral disengagement plan from the Gaza Strip  The plan began to be implemented on 15 August 2005  and was completed on 12 September 2005  Under the plan  all Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip  and four in the West Bank  and the joint Israeli Palestinian Erez Industrial Zone were dismantled with the removal of all 9 000 Israeli settlers  most of them in the Gush Katif settlement area in the Strip s southwest  and military bases  On 12 September 2005 the Israeli cabinet formally declared an end to Israeli military occupation of the Gaza Strip  To avoid allegations that it was still in occupation of any part of the Gaza Strip  Israel also withdrew from the Philadelphi Route  which is a narrow strip adjacent to the Strip s border with Egypt  after Egypt s agreement to secure its side of the border  Under the Oslo Accords the Philadelphi Route was to remain under Israeli control to prevent the smuggling of materials  such as ammunition  and people across the border with Egypt  With Egypt agreeing to patrol its side of the border  it was hoped that the objective would be achieved  However  Israel maintained its control over the crossings in and out of Gaza  The Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza was monitored by the Israeli army through special surveillance cameras  Official documents such as passports  I D  cards  export and import papers  and many others had to be approved by the Israeli army  citation needed   edit  Israel Gaza Strip barrier Main article  Israel Gaza Strip barrier Between 1994 and 1996  Israel built the Israeli Gaza Strip barrier  The separation barrier was first constructed to improve security in Israel  The barrier was largely torn down by Palestinians at the beginning of the Al Aqsa Intifada in September 2000  14  Between December 2000 and June 2001  the barrier fence between the Gaza Strip and Israel was reconstructed  A barrier on the Gaza Strip Egypt border was constructed from 2004  15  There are three main crossing points in the barrier  the northern Erez Crossing into Israel  the southern Rafah Crossing into Egypt  and the eastern Karni Crossing used only for cargo  16  Israel controls the Gaza Strip s northern borders  as well as its territorial waters and airspace  Egypt controls Gaza Strip s southern border  under an agreement between it and Israel  17   edit  2005   Israel s unilateral disengagement The Israel Defence Forces left the Gaza Strip on 1 September 2005 as part of Israel s unilateral disengagement plan  and all Israeli citizens were evicted from the area  An  Agreement on Movement and Access  between Israel and the Palestinian Authority was brokered by Condoleezza Rice in November 2005 to improve Palestinian freedom of movement and economic activity in the Gaza Strip  Under its terms  the Rafah crossing with Egypt was to be reopened  with transits monitored by the Palestinian National Authority and the European Union  Only people with Palestinian ID  or foreign nationals  by exception  in certain categories  subject to Israeli oversight  were permitted to cross in and out  All goods  vehicles and trucks to and from Egypt had to pass through the Israeli crossing at Kerem Shalom  under full Israeli supervision  18  Goods were also permitted transit at the Karni crossing in the north   edit  Legal status Al Deira hotel on the Gaza coast The UN  Human Rights Watch and many other international bodies and NGOs consider Israel to be the occupying power of the Gaza Strip as Israel controls Gaza s airspace and territorial waters  and does not allow the movement of goods in or out of Gaza by air or sea  only by land   19  20  21  However  the border crossing into Egypt is not controlled by Israel  similar to Israel  Egypt has alternately restricted or allowed goods and people to cross that terrestrial border  Israel states that Gaza is no longer occupied  inasmuch as Israel does not exercise effective control or authority over any land or institutions in the Gaza Strip  22  23 Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel Tzipi Livni stated in January  2008   Israel got out of Gaza  It dismantled its settlements there  No Israeli soldiers were left there after the disengagement   24  After Israel withdrew in 2005  Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas stated   the legal status of the areas slated for evacuation has not changed   22 Palestinian American attorney Gregory Khalil said  Israel still controls every person  every good  literally every drop of water to enter or leave the Gaza Strip  Its troops may not be there    but it still restricts the ability for the Palestinian authority to exercise control   25   The issue of the legal status of Gaza strip appears to be particularly complex according to international law and legally intriguing  even after the Operation  Cast Lead  and the Israeli invasion of Gaza in January 2009  26  In his statement on the 2008 2009 Israel Gaza conflict Richard Falk  United Nations Special Rapporteur wrote that international humanitarian law applied to Israel  in regard to the obligations of an Occupying Power and in the requirements of the laws of war   27  In a 2009 interview on Democracy Now Christopher Gunness  spokesperson for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East  UNRWA  called Israel an occupying power  However  Meagan Buren  Senior Adviser to the pro Israeli media group Israel Project  contested that characterization  28  The co founder of Hamas  Mahmoud Zahar  has stated that Gaza is no longer occupied since the Israeli withdrawal  29   edit  Palestinian Authority control  1994 2007  In accordance with the Oslo Accords  the Palestinian Authority took over the administrative authority of the Gaza Strip  other than the settlement blocs and military areas  in 1994  After the complete Israeli withdrawal of Israeli settlers and military from the Gaza Strip on 12 September 2005  the Palestinian Authority had complete administrative authority in the Gaza Strip  Since the Israeli withdrawal the Rafah Border Crossing had been supervised by EU Border Assistance Mission Rafah under an Agreement finalised in November 2005  30   edit  Post election violence Main article  Fatah Hamas conflict In the Palestinian parliamentary elections held on January 25  2006  Hamas won a plurality of 42 9  of the total vote and 74 out of 132 total seats  56    31  32  When Hamas assumed power the next month  the Israeli government and the key players of the international community  the United States and the EU refused to recognize its right to govern the Palestinian Authority  Direct aid to the Palestinian government there was cut off  although some of that money was redirected to humanitarian organizations not affiliated with the government  33  The resulting political disorder and economic stagnation led to many Palestinians emigrating from the Gaza Strip  34  In January 2007  fighting erupted between Hamas and Fatah  The deadliest clashes occurred in the northern Gaza Strip  where General Muhammed Gharib  a senior commander of the Fatah dominated Preventative Security Force  died when a rocket hit his home  Gharib s two daughters and two bodyguards were also killed in the attack  which was carried out by Hamas gunmen  35  At the end of January 2007  a truce was negotiated between Fatah and Hamas  36  However  after a few days  new fighting broke out  37  Fatah fighters stormed a Hamas affiliated university in the Gaza Strip  Officers from Abbas  presidential guard battled Hamas gunmen guarding the Hamas led Interior Ministry  38  In May 2007  new fighting broke out between the factions  39  Interior Minister Hani Qawasmi  who had been considered a moderate civil servant acceptable to both factions  resigned due to what he termed harmful behavior by both sides  40  Fighting spread in the Gaza Strip with both factions attacking vehicles and facilities of the other side  In response to constant attacks by rocket fire from the Gaza Strip  Israel launched an air strike which destroyed a building used by Hamas  Ongoing violence prompted fear that it could bring the end of the Fatah Hamas coalition government  and possibly the end of the Palestinian authority  41  Hamas spokesman Moussa Abu Marzouk blamed the worsening situation on Israel  stating that the constant pressure of economic sanctions resulted in the  real explosion   42  Expressions of concerns were received from many Arab leaders  with many offering to try to help by doing some diplomatic work between the two factions  43  Associated Press reporter Ibrahim Barzak wrote an eyewitness account stating  Today I have seen people shot before my eyes  I heard the screams of terrified women and children in a burning building  and I argued with gunmen who wanted to take over my home  I have seen a lot in my years as a journalist in Gaza  but this is the worst it s been  44   edit  Casualties From 2006 2007 more than 600 Palestinians were killed in factional fighting between Hamas and Fatah  45  In the aftermath of the Gaza War  a series of violent acts killed 54 Palestinians  while hundreds have claimed they were tortured  46  349 Palestinians were killed in fighting between factions in 2007  160 Palestinians killed each other in June alone  47   edit  Hamas control  2007 present  Following the victory of Hamas in the 2006 Palestinian legislative election  Hamas and Fatah formed a Palestinan authority national unity government headed by Ismail Haniya  Shortly after  Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in the course of the Battle of Gaza  48  seizing government institutions and replacing Fatah and other government officials with its own  49  By 14 June  Hamas fully controlled the Gaza Strip  Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas responded by declaring a state of emergency  dissolving the unity government and forming a new government without Hamas participation  PNA security forces in the West Bank arrested a number of Hamas members  Abbas s government received widespread international support  In late June 2008 Egypt  Jordan  and Saudi Arabia said that the West Bank based Cabinet formed by Abbas was the sole legitimate Palestinian government  and Egypt moved its embassy from Gaza to the West Bank  50  The Hamas government in the Gaza Strip faces international  diplomatic  and economic isolation  Watchtower  Rafah border with Egypt Both Saudi Arabia and Egypt supported reconciliation and the forming of a new unity government  and pressed Abbas to start serious talks with Hamas  Abbas had always conditioned this on Hamas  returning control of the Gaza Strip to the Palestinian Authority  Hamas has been invited to and has visited a number of countries  including Russia  and the EU member states  Opposition parties and politicians have also called for a dialogue with Hamas as well as an end to the economic sanctions  After the takeover  Israel and Egypt closed their border crossings with Gaza  Palestinian sources reported that European Union monitors fled the Rafah Border Crossing  on the Gaza Egypt border for fear of being kidnapped or harmed  51  Arab foreign ministers and Palestinian officials presented a united front against control of the border by Hamas  52  Meanwhile  Israeli and Egyptian security reports said that Hamas continued smuggling in large quantities of explosives and arms from Egypt through tunnels  Egyptian security forces uncovered 60 tunnels in 2007  53   edit  After Hamas takeover After Hamas  June win  it ousted Fatah linked officials from positions of power and authority  such as government positions  security services  universities  newspapers  etc   and strove to enforce law by progressively removing guns from the hands of peripheral militias  clans  and criminal groups  and gaining control of supply tunnels  According to Amnesty International  under Hamas rule  newspapers have been closed down and journalists have been harassed  54  Fatah demonstrations have been forbidden or suppressed  as in the case of a large demonstration on the anniversary of Yasser Arafat s death  which resulted in the deaths of seven people  after protesters hurled stones at Hamas security forces  55  Violence against Christians has been recorded  The owner of a Christian bookshop was abducted and murdered  56  and on 15 February 2008  the Christian Youth Organization s library in Gaza City was bombed  57  Hamas and other militant groups continued to fire Qassam rockets across the border into Israel  According to Israel  between the Hamas takeover and the end of January 2008  697 rockets and 822 mortar bombs were fired at Israeli towns  58  In response  Israel targeted home made Qassam launchers and military targets and on 19 September 2007  declared the Gaza Strip a hostile entity  In January 2008  Israel curtailed travel from Gaza  the entry of goods  and cut fuel supplies  resulting in power shortages  This brought charges that Israel was inflicting collective punishment on the Gaza population  leading to international condemnation  Despite multiple reports from within the Strip that food and other essentials were in extremely short supply   59  Israel countered that Gaza had enough food and energy supplies for weeks  60  In early March 2008  air strikes and ground incursions by the IDF led to the deaths of over 110 Palestinians and extensive damage to Jabalia  61  After Egypt s President Hosni Mubarak resigned  on May 28  2011  Egypt permanently opened its border with the Gaza Strip  62   edit  Barrier breach Main article  2008 breach of the Gaza Egypt border On 23 January 2008  after months of preparation during which the steel reinforcement of the border barrier was weakened  63 Hamas destroyed several parts of the wall dividing Gaza and Egypt in the town of Rafah  Hundreds of thousands of Gazans crossed the border into Egypt seeking food and supplies  Due to the crisis  Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak ordered his troops to allow the Palestinians in but to verify that they did not bring weapons back across the border  64  Egypt arrested and later released several armed Hamas militants in the Sinai who presumably wanted to infiltrate into Israel  At the same time  Israel increased its state of alert along the length of the Israel Egypt Sinai border  and warned its citizens to leave Sinai  without delay   The EU Border Monitors indicated their readiness to return to monitor the border  should Hamas guarantee their safety  while the Palestinian Authority demanded that Egypt deal only with the Authority in negotiations relating to borders  Israel eased up some influx of goods and medical supplies to the strip  but it curtailed electricity by 5  in one of its ten lines  while Hamas and Egypt shored up some of the gaping holes between the two areas  65  The first attempts by Egypt to reclose the border were met by violent clashes with Gaza gunmen  but after 12 days the borders were sealed again  citation needed  By mid February the Rafah crossing remained closed  66  In February 2008 a Haaretz poll indicated that 64  of Israelis favour their government holding direct talks with Hamas in Gaza about a cease fire and to secure the release of Gilad Shalit  67  an Israeli soldier who was captured in a cross border raid by Hamas militants on 25 June 2006 and has been held hostage since  68  69  70  In February 2008  Israeli Palestinian fighting intensified with rockets launched at Israeli cities and Israel attacking Palestinian gunmen  Military aggression by Hamas led to a heavy Israeli military action on 1 March 2008  resulting in over 110 Palestinians being killed according to BBC News  as well as 2 Israeli soldiers  Israeli human rights group B Tselem estimated that 45 of those killed were not involved in hostilities  and 15 were minors  71  After a round of tit for tat arrests between Fatah and Hamas in the Gaza Strip and West Bank  the Hilles clan from Gaza were relocated to Jericho on 4 August 2008  72  Retiring Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said on 11 November 2008   The question is not whether there will be a confrontation  but when it will take place  under what circumstances  and who will control these circumstances  who will dictate them  and who will know to exploit the time from the beginning of the ceasefire until the moment of confrontation in the best possible way   On 14 November 2008  Gaza was blockaded by Israel in response to the rocket and mortar attacks by Hamas and other militant groups operating inside Gaza  73  however food  power and water can still enter from Egypt if the Egyptian authorities allow it  On November 28  2008  after a 24 hour period in which no Qassam rockets were fired into Israel  the IDF facilitated the transfer of over 30 truckloads of food  basic supplies and medicine into the Gaza Strip  and it also transferred fuel to the main power plant of the area  74  On 25 November 2008

series of air strikes against targets in Gaza as a response to a continuous period of rockets fired from the strip to Israel  Various sites being used as weapons depots were struck  police stations  schools  hospitals  UN warehouses  mosques  various Hamas government buildings and other buildings  77  Israel said that the attack was a response to Hamas rocket attacks on southern Israel  which totaled over 3 000 in 2008  and which intensified during the few weeks preceding the operation  Palestinian medical staff claimed at least 434 Palestinians were killed  and at least 2 800 wounded  consisting of many civilians and an unknown number of Hamas members  in the first five days of Israeli strikes on Gaza  The Israel Defense Forces rejected claims the majority of those killed were civilians  providing evidence that Hamas deliberately hides weapons and fighters in  mosques  school yards and civilian houses  to deter an attack and exploit Israel s rules of engagement  78  Israel began a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip on 3 January 2009  79  Israel rebuffed many cease fire calls and both sides declared unilateral cease fires  80  81  A total of 1 100 1 400 82  Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed in the 22 day war  83  After 22 days of fighting  Israel declared a ceasefire  Hamas vowed to continue the battle if Israeli forces did not leave the Strip  84  The

2009  food availability returned to pre war levels but the supplies of local fresh foods were anticipated to decrease seriously by April June 2009 due to the severe damages sustained by the agricultural sector during the war  93   edit  Gaza blockade Main article  2007 present blockade of the Gaza Strip The blockade of the Gaza strip continued after the end of the war  although Israel allowed in limited quantities of medical humanitarian aid  The Red Cross said that the blockade was harming the Gazan economy and causing a shortage of basic medicines and equipment such as painkillers and x ray film  94  Director of the Shin Bet  Israel Security Agency  Yuval Diskin has said he would not oppose the loosening of trade restrictions  but believed that smuggling tunnels in the Sinai and an open seaport in the Gaza Strip endangered the security of Israel  According to Diskin  Hamas and Islamic Jihad have smuggled over  5 000 rockets with ranges up to 40 kilometers   Some of the rockets can reach as far as the Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area  95  Mark Regev  spokesman for the Israeli prime minister s office  described Israel s actions as  sanctions   not a blockade  but a Gazan legal consultant for UNRWA called the blockade  an action outside of international law   96  In July 2010  British prime minister David Cameron criticized the blockade  saying  Humanitarian goods and people must flow in both directions  Gaza cannot and must not be allowed to remain a prison camp    97  In response  the spokesman for the Israeli embassy in London said  The people of Gaza are the prisoners of the terrorist organisation Hamas  The situation in Gaza is the direct result of Hamas  rule and priorities   Tent camp  April 2009 The Arab League has accused Israel of waging a financial war  98  The IDF strictly controls travel within the area of the crossing points between Israel and the Gaza Strip  and has sealed its border with Gaza  The security environment within Gaza and along its borders  including its border with Egypt and its seacoast  is dangerous and can change at any time  99  Facing mounting international calls to ease or lift their blockade  Egypt and Israel lessened the restrictions starting in June 2010  when the Rafah border crossing from Egypt to Gaza has been partially opened by Egypt  and Egypt s foreign ministry has made it clear that the crossing will remain open mainly for people  but not for supplies  to go through  100  Israel announced that it will allow all strictly civilian goods into Gaza while preventing certain weapons and dual use items from entering the Hamas run Gaza  101   edit  Islamization Trend Main article  Islamization of the Gaza Strip From 1987 to 1991  during the first intifada  Hamas campaigned for the wearing of the hijab alongside other measures  including insisting women stay at home be segregated from men  and the promotion of polygamy  In the course of this campaign women who chose not to wear the hijab were verbally and physically harassed  with the result that the hijab was being worn  just to avoid problems on the streets   102  Since Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in 2007  some of its members have attempted to impose Islamic dress or the Hijab head covering on women  103  104  Also  the government s  Islamic Endowment Ministry  has deployed Virtue Committee members to warn citizens of the dangers of immodest dress  card playing and dating  105  However  there are no government laws imposing dress and other moral standards  and the Hamas education ministry reversed one effort to impose Islamic dress on students  103  There has also been successful resistance to attempts by local Hamas officials to impose Islamic dress on women  106  According to Human Rights Watch  the Hamas controlled government of Gaza stepped up its efforts to  Islamize  Gaza in 2010  efforts that included  according to the organization  the  repression of civil society  and  severe violations of personal freedom   107  Palestinian researcher Dr  Khaled Al Hroub has criticized what he called the  Taliban like steps  Hamas has taken  He wrote   The Islamization that has been forced upon the Gaza Strip   the suppression of social  cultural  and press freedoms that do not suit Hamas s view s    is an egregious deed that must be opposed  It is the reenactment  under a religious guise  of the experience of  other  totalitarian regimes and dictatorships  108  Hamas officials denied having any plans to impose Islamic law  one legislator stating that  What you are seeing are incidents  not policy   and that Islamic law is the desired standard  but we believe in persuasion   105   edit  Israel s cooperation with international aid programs Between January 2009 June 2010  approximately 2 billion pounds of aid  137 million liters of fuel  and 50 000 tons of cooking gas were delivered through Israel to the Gaza Strip  109  110  111  There are also cases where aid to Gazans is blocked by Israel such as the Gaza flotilla raid  112  though the aid was subsequently transferred through Israel once it had been searched for weapons and other contraband material  In January and February 2011  the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  UNOCHA  conducted an assessment of the effects of the measures to ease the access restrictions  113  They concluded that they did not result in a significant improvement in people s livelihoods  113  They found that the  pivotal nature of the remaining restrictions  and the effects of three years of strict blockade prevented a significant improvement in livelihoods and called on Israel to fully abolish the blockade including removing restrictions on the import of construction materials
