ASIMO  2000  at the Expo 2005  a humanoid robot Articulated welding robots used in a factory A robot is a mechanical or virtual intelligent agent that can perform tasks automatically or with guidance  typically by remote control  In practice a robot is usually an electro mechanical machine that is guided by computer and electronic programming  citation needed  Robots can be autonomous  semi autonomous or remotely controlled  The word robot first appeared in the play Rossum s Universal Robots by the Czech writer Karel  apek in 1920  Complex mechanisms and automata date back to ancient Egypt and were experimented with by varying thinkers over the centuries including Leonardo Da Vinci  Jacques de Vaucanson  and the Japanese Karakuri zui  Illustrated Machinery  in 1796  The 19th and early 20th century saw the development of remote and radio controlled devices and even machines that tried to mimic more human like features  The first electronic autonomous robots were created by William Grey Walter in Bristol  England  in 1948  The first digital and programmable robot was invented by George Devol in 1954  Robots are used in an increasingly wide variety of tasks such as vacuuming floors  mowing lawns  cleaning drains  building cars  in warfare  and in tasks that are too expensive or too dangerous to be performed by humans such as exploring outer space or at the bottom of the sea  Robots range from humanoids such as ASIMO and TOPIO to Nano robots  Swarm robots  Industrial robots  military robots  mobile and servicing robots  The branch of technology that

as robots but there is general agreement among experts  and the public  that robots tend to do some or all of the following  move around  operate a mechanical limb  sense and manipulate their environment  and exhibit intelligent behavior   especially behavior which mimics humans or other animals  There is no one definition of robot which satisfies everyone and many people have their own  2  For example Joseph Engelberger  a pioneer in industrial robotics  once remarked   I can t define a robot  but I know one when I see one   3  According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica a robot is  any automatically operated machine that replaces human effort  though it may not resemble human beings in appearance or perform functions in a humanlike manner   4 Merriam Webster describes a robot as a  machine that looks like a human being and performs various complex acts  as walking or talking  of a human being   or a  device that automatically performs complicated often repetitive tasks   or a  mechanism guided by automatic controls   5  The various types of robots KITT  a fictitious robot  is mentally anthropomorphic ASIMO is physically anthropomorphic  edit  Defining characteristics While there is no single correct definition of  robot   6  a typical robot will have several  or possibly all  of the following characteristics  It is an electric machine which has some ability to interact with physical objects and to be given electronic programming to do a specific task or to do a whole range of tasks or actions  It may also have some ability to perceive and absorb data on physical objects  or on its local physical environment  or to process data  or to respond to various stimuli  This is in contrast to a simple mechanical device such as a gear or a hydraulic press or any other item which has no processing ability and which does tasks through purely mechanical processes and motion  citation needed  Mental agency For robotic engineers  the physical appearance of a machine is less important than the way its actions are controlled  The more the control system seems to have agency of its own  the more likely the machine is to be called a robot  An important feature of agency is the ability to make choices  Higher level cognitive functions  though  are not necessary  as shown by ant robots  citation needed  A clockwork car is never considered a robot  citation needed  A mechanical device able to perform some preset motions but with no ability to adapt  an automaton  is rarely considered a robot  citation needed  A remotely operated vehicle is sometimes considered a robot  or telerobot   7  A car with an onboard computer  like Bigtrak  which could drive in a programmable sequence  might be called a robot  citation needed  A self controlled car which could sense its environment and make driving decisions based on this information  such as the 1990s driverless cars of Ernst Dickmanns or the entries in the DARPA Grand Challenge  would quite likely be called a robot  citation needed  A sentient car  like the fictional KITT  which can make decisions  navigate freely and converse fluently with a human  is usually considered a robot  citation needed  Physical agency However  for many laymen  if a machine appears able to control its arms or limbs  and especially if it appears anthropomorphic or zoomorphic  e g  ASIMO or Aibo   it would be called a robot  citation needed  A player piano is rarely characterized as a robot  8  A CNC milling machine is very occasionally characterized as a robot  citation needed  A factory automation arm is almost always characterized as an industrial robot  citation needed  An autonomous wheeled or tracked device  such as a self guided rover or self guided vehicle  is almost always characterized as a mobile robot or service robot  citation needed  A zoomorphic mechanical toy  like Roboraptor  is usually characterized as a robot  9  A mechanical humanoid  like ASIMO  is almost always characterized as a robot  usually as a service robot  citation needed  Even for a 3 axis CNC milling machine using the same control system as a robot arm  it is the arm which is almost always called a robot  while the CNC machine is usually just a machine  Having eyes can also make a difference in whether a machine is called a robot  since humans instinctively connect eyes with sentience  However  simply being anthropomorphic is not a sufficient criterion for something to be called a robot  A robot must do something  an inanimate object shaped like ASIMO would not be considered a robot  citation needed   edit  History Main article  History of robots The idea of automata originates in the mythologies of many cultures around the world  Engineers and inventors from ancient civilizations  including Ancient China  10 Ancient Greece  and Ptolemaic Egypt  11  attempted to build self operating machines  some resembling animals and humans  Early descriptions of automata include the artificial doves of Archytas  12  the artificial birds of Mozi and Lu Ban  13  a  speaking  automaton by Hero of Alexandria  a washstand automaton by Philo of Byzantium  and a human automaton described in the Lie Zi

by the Greek god Hephaestus 20   Vulcan to the Romans   the clay golems of Jewish legend and clay giants of Norse legend  and Galatea  the mythical statue of Pygmalion that came to life  Since cerca 400 BCE  myths of Crete that were incorporated into Greek mythology include Talos  a man of bronze who guarded the Cretian island of Europa from pirates  In ancient Greece  the Greek engineer Ctesibius  c  270 BC   applied a knowledge of pneumatics and hydraulics to produce the first organ and water clocks with moving figures   21  22  In the 4th century BC  the Greek mathematician Archytas of Tarentum postulated a mechanical steam operated bird he called  The Pigeon   Hero of Alexandria  10 70 AD   a Greek mathematician and inventor  created numerous user configurable automated devices  and described machines powered by air pressure  steam and water  23  In ancient China  the 3rd century BC text of the Lie Zi describes an account of humanoid automata  involving a much earlier encounter between King Mu of Zhou  Chinese emperor 10th century BC  and a mechanical engineer known as Yan Shi  an  artificer   The latter proudly presented the king with a life size  human shaped figure of his mechanical  handiwork  made of leather  wood  and artificial organs  10  There are also accounts of flying automata in the Han Fei Zi and other texts  which attributes the 5th century BC Mohist philosopher Mozi and his contemporary Lu Ban with the invention of artificial wooden birds  ma yuan  that could successfully fly  13  In 1066  the Chinese inventor Su Song built a water clock in the form of a tower which featured mechanical figurines which chimed the hours  The beginning of automata is associated with the invention of early Su Song s astronomical clock tower featured mechanical figurines that chimed the hours  24  In the medieval Islamic world  Al Jazari  1136 1206   a Muslim inventor during the Artuqid dynasty  designed and constructed a number of automated machines  including kitchen appliances  musical automata powered by water  and programmable automata  14  25  The autmomata appeared as four musicians on a boat in a lake  entertaining guests at royal drinking parties  His mechanism had a programmable drum machine with pegs  cams  that bumped into little levers that operated percussion instruments  The drummer could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns by moving the pegs to different locations  25  Washstand automaton reconstruction  as described by Philo of Byzantium  Greece  3rd century BC   Al Jazari

Early modern developments In Renaissance Italy  Leonardo da Vinci  1452 1519  sketched plans for a humanoid robot around 1495  Da Vinci s notebooks  rediscovered in the 1950s  contained detailed drawings of a mechanical knight now known as Leonardo s robot  able to sit up  wave its arms and move its head and jaw  26  The design was probably based on anatomical research recorded in his Vitruvian Man  It is not known whether he attempted to build it  In Japan  complex animal and human automata were built between the 17th to 19th centuries  with many described in the 18th century Karakuri zui  Illustrated Machinery  1796   One such automaton was the karakuri ningy   a mechanized puppet  27  Different variations of the karakuri existed  the Butai karakuri  which were used in theatre  the Zashiki karakuri  which were small and used in homes  and the Dashi karakuri which were used in religious festivals  where the puppets were used to perform reenactments of traditional myths and legends  In France  between 1738 and 1739  Jacques de Vaucanson exhibited several life sized automatons  a flute player  a pipe player and a duck  The mechanical duck could flap its wings  crane its neck  and swallow food from the exhibitor s hand  and it gave the illusion of digesting its food by excreting matter stored in a hidden compartment  28   edit  Modern developments The Japanese craftsman Hisashige Tanaka  1799 1881   known as  Japan s Edison  or  Karakuri Giemon   created an array of extremely complex mechanical toys  some of which served tea  fired arrows drawn from a quiver  and even painted a Japanese kanji character  29  A remotely operated vehicles were demonstrated in the late 19th in the form of several types of remotely controlled torpedos  The early 1870 s saw remotely controlled torpedos by John Ericsson  pneumatic   John Louis Lay  electric wire guided   and Victor von Scheliha  electric wire guided   15  In 1898 Nikola Tesla publicly demonstrated a  wireless  radio controlled torpedo that he hoped sell to the US Navy  30  31  In 1926  Westinghouse Electric Corporation created Televox  the first robot put to useful work  They followed Televox with a number of other simple robots  including one called Rastus  made in the crude image of a black man  In the 1930s  they created a humanoid robot known as Elektro for exhibition purposes  including the 1939 and 1940 World s Fairs  32  33  In 1928  Japan s first robot  Gakutensoku  was designed and constructed by biologist Makoto Nishimura  The first electronic autonomous robots with complex behaviour were created by William Grey Walter of the Burden Neurological Institute at Bristol  England in 1948 and 1949  They were named Elmer and Elsie  These robots could sense light and contact with external objects  and use these stimuli to navigate  34  The first truly modern robot  digitally operated and programmable  was invented by George Devol in 1954 and was ultimately called the Unimate  Devol sold the first Unimate to General Motors in 1960  and it was installed in 1961 in a plant in Trenton  New Jersey to lift hot pieces of metal from a die casting machine and stack them  35  Devol s patent for the first digitally operated programmable robotic arm represents the foundation of the modern robotics industry  36  Commercial and industrial robots are now in widespread use performing jobs more cheaply or with greater accuracy and reliability than humans  They are also employed for jobs which are too dirty  dangerous or dull to be suitable for humans  Robots are widely used in manufacturing  assembly and packing  transport  earth and space exploration  surgery  weaponry  laboratory research  and mass production of consumer and industrial goods  37   edit  Etymology See also  Glossary of robotics A scene from Karel  apek s 1920 play R U R   Rossum s Universal Robots   showing three robots The word robot was introduced to the public by the Czech interwar writer Karel  apek in his play R U R   Rossum s Universal Robots   published in 1920  38  The play begins in a factory that makes artificial people called robots  though they are closer to the modern ideas of androids  creatures who can be mistaken for humans  They can plainly think for themselves  though they seem happy to serve  At issue is whether the robots are being exploited and the consequences of their treatment  Karel  apek himself did not coin the word  He wrote a short letter in reference to an etymology in the Oxford English Dictionary in which he named his brother  the painter and writer Josef  apek  as its actual originator  38  In an article in the Czech journal Lidov  noviny in 1933  he explained that he had originally wanted to call the creatures labo i   workers   from Latin labor  or d l asi  from Czech d ln ci    workers    However  he did not like the word  and sought advice from his brother Josef  who suggested  roboti   The word robota means literally  corv e    serf labor   and figuratively  drudgery  or  hard work  in Czech and also  more general   work    labor  in many Slavic languages  e g   Slovak  Polish  Macedonian  Ukrainian  archaic Czech   Traditionally the robota was the work period a serf  corv e  had to give for his lord  typically 6 months of the year  The origin of the word is the Old Church Slavonic rabota  servitude    work  in contemporary Bulgarian and Russian   which in turn comes from the Indo European root  orbh   39 Serfdom was outlawed in 1848 in Bohemia  so at the time  apek wrote R U R   usage of the term robota had broadened to include various types of work  but the obsolete sense of  serfdom  would still have been known  40  It is not clear from which language  apek took the radix  robot a    This question is not irrelevant  because its answer could help to reveal an original  apek s conception of robots  If from the modern Czech language  the notion of robot should be understood as an  automatic serf   it means a subordinated creature without own will   If from e g  Slovak  Karel  apek and his brother were frequent visitors of Slovakia which in this time was a part of Czechoslovakia  because their father MUDr  Anton n  apek from 1916 worked as a physician in Tren ianske Teplice  41    the word robot would simply mean a  worker  which is a more universal and neutral notion  The aspect of pronunciation probably also played a role in  apek s final decision  In non Slavic languages it is easier to pronounce the word robot than d l as or labo   The word robotics  used to describe this field of study  was coined by the science fiction writer Isaac Asimov  Asimov created the  Three Laws of Robotics  which are a recurring theme in his books  These have since been used by many others to define laws used in fact and fiction  Introduced in his 1942 short story  Runaround  the Laws state the following    A robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm  A robot must obey any orders given to it by human beings  except where such orders would conflict with the First Law  A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law     edit  Modern robots A laparoscopic robotic surgery machine  edit  Mobile robot Main articles  Mobile robot and Automated guided vehicle Mobile robots have the capability to move around in their environment and are not fixed to one physical location  An example of a mobile robot that is in common use today is the automated guided vehicle or automatic guided vehicle  AGV   An AGV is a mobile robot that follows markers or wires in the floor  or uses vision or lasers  AGVs are discussed later in this article  citation needed  Mobile robots are also found in industry  military and security environments  They also appear as consumer products  for entertainment or to perform certain tasks like vacuum cleaning  Mobile robots are the focus of a great deal of current research and almost every major university has one or more labs that focus on mobile robot research  citation needed  Modern robots are usually used in tightly controlled environments such as on assembly lines because they have difficulty responding to unexpected interference  Because of this most humans rarely encounter robots  However domestic robots for cleaning and maintenance are increasingly common in and around homes in developed countries  Robots can also be found in military applications  citation needed   edit  Industrial robots  manipulating  Main articles  Industrial robot and Manipulator Industrial robots usually consist of a jointed arm  multi linked manipulator  and an end effector that is attached to a fixed surface  One of the most common type of end effector is a gripper assembly  The International Organization for Standardization gives a definition of a manipulating industrial robot in ISO 8373   an automatically controlled  reprogrammable  multipurpose  manipulator programmable in three or more axes  which may be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications   42  This definition is used by the International Federation of Robotics  the European Robotics Research Network  EURON  and many national standards committees  43  A Pick and Place robot in a factory  edit  Service robot Main article  Service robot Most commonly industrial robots are fixed robotic arms and manipulators used primarily for production and distribution of goods  The term  service robot  is less well defined  IFR has proposed a tentative definition   A service robot is a robot which operates semi  or fully autonomously to perform services useful to the well being of humans and equipment  excluding manufacturing operations   citation needed   edit  Modular robot Main article  Self reconfiguring modular robot Modular robots is a new breed of robots that are designed to increase the utilization of the robots by modularizing the robots  The functionality and effectiveness of a modular robot is easier to increase compared to conventional robots   edit  Robots in society Roughly half of all the robots in the world are in Asia  32  in Europe  and 16  in North America  1  in Australasia and 1  in Africa  44  30  of all the robots in the world are in Japan  45  making Japan the country with the highest number of robots   edit  Regional perspectives In Japan and South Korea  ideas of future robots have been mainly positive  and the start of the pro robotic society there is thought to be possibly due to the famous  Astro Boy   Asian societies such as Japan  South Korea  and more recently  China  believe robots to be more equal to humans  having them care for old people  play with or teach children  or replace pets etc  46  The general view in Asian cultures is that the more robots advance  the better   This is the opening of an era in which human beings and robots can co exist   says Japanese firm Mitsubishi about one of the many humanistic robots in Japan  47  South Korea aims to put a robot in every house there by 2015 2020 in order to help catch up technologically with Japan  48  49  Western societies are more likely to be against  or even fear the development of robotics  through much media output in movies and literature that they will replace humans  Some believe that the West regards robots as a  threat  to the future of humans  partly due to religious beliefs about the role of humans and society  50  51  Obviously  these boundaries are not clear  but there is a significant difference between the two cultural viewpoints   edit  Autonomy and ethical questions Main articles  Roboethics and Ethics of artificial intelligence An android  or robot designed to resemble a human  can appear comforting to some people and disturbing to others 52  As robots have become more advanced and sophisticated  experts and academics have increasingly explored the questions of what ethics might govern robots  behavior  53  and whether robots might be able to claim any kind of social  cultural  ethical or legal rights  54  One scientific team has said that it is possible that a robot brain will exist by 2019  55  Others predict robot intelligence breakthroughs by 2050  56  Recent advances have made robotic behavior more sophisticated  57  The social impact of intelligent robots is subject of a 2010 documentary film called Plug  amp  Pray  58  Vernor Vinge has suggested that a moment may come when computers and robots are smarter than humans  He calls this  the Singularity   59  He suggests that it may be somewhat or possibly very dangerous for humans  60  This is discussed by a philosophy called Singularitarianism  In 2009  experts attended a conference hosted by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence  AAAI  to discuss whether computers and robots might be able to acquire any autonomy  and how much these abilities might pose a threat or hazard  They noted that some robots have acquired various forms of semi autonomy  including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons  They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved  cockroach intelligence   They noted that self awareness as depicted in science fiction is probably unlikely  but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls  59  Various media sources and scientific groups have noted separate trends in differing areas which might together result in greater robotic functionalities and autonomy  and which pose some inherent concerns  61  62  63   edit  Military robots Some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat  especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions  64  There are also concerns about technology which might allow some armed robots to be controlled mainly by other robots  65  The US Navy has funded a report which indicates that as military robots become more complex  there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions  66  67  One researcher states that autonomous robots might be more humane  as they could make decisions more effectively  However  other experts question this  68  Some public concerns about autonomous robots have received media attention  69  One robot in particular  the EATR  has generated concerns over its fuel source as it can continually refuel itself using organic substances  70  Although the engine for the EATR is designed to run on biomass and vegetation 71  specifically selected by its sensors which it can find on battlefields or other local environments  the project has stated that chicken fat can also be used  72   edit  Contemporary uses See also  List of robots At present there are two main types of robots  based on their use  general purpose autonomous robots and dedicated robots  Robots can be classified by their specificity of purpose  A robot might be designed to perform one particular task extremely well  or a range of tasks less well  Of course  all robots by their nature can be re programmed to behave differently  but some are limited by their physical form  For example  a factory robot arm can perform jobs such as cutting  welding  gluing  or acting as a fairground ride  while a pick and place robot can only populate printed circuit boards   edit  General purpose autonomous robots Main article  Autonomous robot General purpose autonomous robots can perform a variety of functions independently  General purpose autonomous robots typically can navigate independently in known spaces  handle their own re charging needs  interface with electronic doors and elevators and perform other basic tasks  Like computers  general purpose robots can link with networks  software and accessories that increase their usefulness  They may recognize people or objects  talk  provide companionship  monitor environmental quality  respond to alarms  pick up supplies and perform other useful tasks  General purpose robots may perform a variety of functions simultaneously or they may take on different roles at different times of day  Some such robots try to mimic human beings and may even resemble people in appearance  this type of robot is called a humanoid robot  Humanoid robots are still in a very limited stage  as no humanoid robot  can  as of yet  actually navigate around a room that it has never been in  Thus humanoid robots are really quite limited  despite their intelligent behaviors in their well known environments  A general purpose robot acts as a guide during the day and a security guard at night Eskrota   A generic and modular robot serving manufacturing to service level industries  edit  Factory robots Car production Over the last three decades automobile factories have become dominated by robots  A typical factory contains hundreds of industrial robots working on fully automated production lines  with one robot for every ten human workers  On an automated production line  a vehicle chassis on a conveyor is welded  glued  painted and finally assembled at a sequence of robot stations  An intelligent AGV drops off goods without needing lines or beacons in the workspace Packaging Industrial robots are also used extensively for palletizing and packaging of manufactured goods  for example for rapidly taking drink cartons from the end of a conveyor belt and placing them into boxes  or for loading and unloading machining centers  Electronics Mass produced printed circuit boards  PCBs  are almost exclusively manufactured by pick and place robots  typically with SCARA manipulators  which remove tiny electronic components from strips or trays  and place them on to PCBs with great accuracy  73  Such robots can place hundreds of thousands of components per hour  far out performing a human in speed  accuracy  and reliability  74  Automated guided vehicles  AGVs  Mobile robots  following markers or wires in the floor  or using vision 75  or lasers  are used to transport goods around large facilities  such as warehouses  container ports  or hospitals  76  Early AGV Style Robots Limited to tasks that could be accurately defined and had to be performed the same way every time  Very little feedback or intelligence was required  and the robots needed only the most basic exteroceptors  sensors   The limitations of these AGVs are that their paths are not easily altered and they cannot alter their paths if obstacles block them  If one AGV breaks down  it may stop the entire operation  Interim AGV Technologies Developed to deploy triangulation from beacons or bar code grids for scanning on the floor or ceiling  In most factories  triangulation systems tend to require moderate to high maintenance  such as daily cleaning of all beacons or bar codes  Also  if a tall pallet or large vehicle blocks beacons or a bar code is marred  AGVs may become lost  Often such AGVs are designed to be used in human free environments  Intelligent AGVs  i AGVs  A U S  Marine Corps technician prepares to use a telerobot to detonate a buried improvised explosive device near Camp Fallujah  Iraq Such as SmartLoader  77  SpeciMinder  78  ADAM  79  Tug 80  Eskorta  81  and MT 400 with Motivity 82  are designed for people friendly workspaces  They navigate by recognizing natural features  3D scanners or other means of sensing the environment in two or three dimensions help to eliminate cumulative errors in dead reckoning calculations of the AGV s current position  Some AGVs can create maps of their environment using scanning lasers with simultaneous localization and mapping  SLAM  and use those maps to navigate in real time with other path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms  They are able to operate in complex environments and perform non repetitive and non sequential tasks such as transporting photomasks in a semiconductor lab  specimens in hospitals and goods in warehouses  For dynamic areas  such as warehouses full of pallets  AGVs require additional strategies using three dimensional sensors such as time of flight or stereovision cameras   edit  Dirty  dangerous  dull or inaccessible tasks There are many jobs which humans would rather leave to robots  The job may be boring  such as domestic cleaning  or dangerous  such as exploring inside a volcano  83  Other jobs are physically inaccessible  such as exploring another planet  84  cleaning the inside of a long pipe  or performing laparoscopic surgery  85  Space probes Almost every unmanned space probe ever launched was a robot  Some were launched in the 1960s with very limited abilities  but their ability to fly and land  in the case of Luna 9  is an indication of their status as a robot  This includes the Voyager probes and the Galileo probes  and others  Telerobots When a human cannot be present on site to perform a job because it is dangerous  far away  or inaccessible  teleoperated robots  or telerobots are used  Rather than following a predetermined sequence of movements  a telerobot is controlled from a distance by a human operator  The robot may be in another room or another country  or may be on a very different scale to the operator  For instance  a laparoscopic surgery robot allows the surgeon to work inside a human patient on a relatively small scale compared to open surgery  significantly shortening recovery time  85  When disabling a bomb  the operator sends a small robot to disable it  Several authors have been using a device called the Longpen to sign books remotely  86  Teleoperated robot aircraft  like the Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicle  are increasingly being used by the military  These pilotless drones can search terrain and fire on targets  87  88  Hundreds of robots such as iRobot s Packbot and the Foster Miller TALON are being used in Iraq and Afghanistan by the U S  military to defuse roadside bombs or improvised explosive devices  IEDs  in an activity known as explosive ordnance disposal  EOD   89  Automated fruit harvesting machines The Roomba domestic vacuum cleaner robot does a single  menial job Used to pick fruit on orchards at a cost lower than that of human pickers  In the home As prices fall and robots become smarter and more autonomous  simple robots dedicated to a single task work in over a million homes  They are taking on simple but unwanted jobs  such as vacuum cleaning and floor washing  and lawn mowing  Some find these robots to be cute and entertaining  which is one reason that they can sell very well  Duct cleaning The ANATROLLER ARI 100 is a modular mobile robot used for cleaning hazardous environments In the hazardous and tight spaces of a building s duct work  many hours can be spent cleaning relatively small areas if a manual brush is used  Robots have been used by many duct cleaners primarily in the industrial and institutional cleaning markets  as they allow the job to be done faster  without exposing workers to the harmful enzymes released by dust mites  For cleaning high security institutions such as embassies and prisons  duct cleaning robots are vital  as they allow the job to be completed without compromising the security of the institution  Hospitals and other government buildings with hazardous and cancerogenic environments such as nuclear reactors legally must be cleaned using duct cleaning robots  in countries such as Canada  in an effort to improve workplace safety in duct cleaning   edit  Military robots Main article  Military robots Military robots include the SWORDS robot which is currently used in ground based combat  It can use a variety of weapons and there is some discussion of giving it some degree of autonomy in battleground situations  90  91  92  Unmanned combat air vehicles  UCAVs   which are an upgraded form of UAVs  can do a wide variety of missions  including combat  UCAVs are being designed such as the Mantis UCAV which would have the ability to fly themselves  to pick their own course and target  and to make most decisions on their own  93  The BAE Taranis is a UCAV built by Great Britain which can fly across continents without a pilot and has new means to avoid detection  94  Flight trials are expected to begin in 2011  95  96  The AAAI has studied this topic in depth 53  and its president has commissioned a study to look at this issue  97  Some have suggested a need to build  Friendly AI   meaning that the advances which are already occurring with AI should also include an effort to make AI intrinsically friendly and humane  98  Several such measures reportedly already exist  with robot heavy countries such as Japan and South Korea 48  having begun to pass regulations requiring robots to be equipped with safety systems  and possibly sets of  laws  akin to Asimov s Three Laws of Robotics  99  100  An official report was issued in 2009 by the Japanese government s Robot Industry Policy Committee  101  Chinese officials and researchers have issued a report suggesting a set of ethical rules  and a set of new legal guidelines referred to as  Robot Legal Studies   102  Some concern has been expressed over a possible occurrence of robots telling apparent falsehoods  103   edit  Mining Robots Mining robots are designed to help counteract a number of challenges currently facing the mining industry  including skills shortages  improving productivity from declining ore grades  and achieving environmental targets  Due to the hazardous nature of mining  in particular underground mining  the prevalence of autonomous  semi autonomous  and tele operated robots has greatly increased in recent times  A number of vehicle manufacturers provide autonomous trains  trucks and loaders that will load material  transport it on the mine site to its destination  and unload without requiring human intervention  One of the worlds largest mining corporations  Rio Tinto has recently expanded its autonomous vehicle fleet to the worlds largest  consisting of 150 autonomous Komatsu trucks  operating in Western Australia  104   Drilling  longwall and rockbreaking machines are now also available as autonomous robots  105   The Atlas Copco Rig Control System can autonomously execute a drilling plan on a drilling rig  moving the rig into position using GPS  setup the drill rig and drill down to specified depths  106  Similarly  the Transmin Rocklogic system can automatically plan a path to position a rockbreaker at a selected destination 107  These systems greatly enhance the safety and efficiency of mining operations   edit  Schools This section may contain original research  Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding references  Statements consisting only of original research may be

in the 21st century has three main applications  Robotic kits  Virtual tutors  and teacher s assistants  Robot kits Robotic kits like Lego Mindstorms  BIOLOID  OLLO from ROBOTIS  or BotBrain Educational Robots can help children to learn about mathematics  physics  programming  and electronics  Robot competitions Robotics have also been introduced into the lives of elementary and high school students with the company FIRST  For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology   The organization is the foundation for the FIRST Robotics Competition  FIRST LEGO League  Junior FIRST LEGO League  and FIRST Tech Challenge competitions  Virtual tutors Virtual tutors are some kind of embodied agent that helps children to do their homework  for example  on peer to peer basis  Teacher assistants Robots as teacher assistants let children to be more assertive during the class and get more motivated  South Korea is the first country deploying a program to have a robot in each school  citation needed   edit  Healthcare Robots in healthcare have two main functions  Those which assist an individual  such as a sufferer of a disease like Multiple Sclerosis  and those which aid in the overall systems such as pharmacies and hospitals  Home automation for the elderly and disabled Further information  Disability robot The Care Providing Robot FRIEND   Photo  IAT  Robots have developed over time from simple basic robotic assistants  such as the Handy 1  110  through to semi autonomous robots  such as FRIEND which can assist the elderly and disabled with common tasks  The population is aging in many countries  especially Japan  meaning that there are increasing numbers of elderly people to care for  but relatively fewer young people to care for them  111  112  Humans make the best carers  but where they are unavailable  robots are gradually being introduced  113  FRIEND is a semi autonomous robot designed to support disabled and elderly people in their daily life activities  like preparing and serving a meal  FRIEND make it possible for patients who are paraplegic  have muscle diseases or serious paralysis  due to strokes etc    to perform tasks without help from other people like therapists or nursing staff  Pharmacies Main article  Pharmacy automation This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Script Pro manufactures a robot designed to help pharmacies fill prescriptions that consist of oral solids or medications in pill form  The pharmacist or pharmacy technician enters the prescription information into its information system  The system  upon determining whether or not the drug is in the robot  will send the information to the robot for filling  The robot has 3 different size vials to fill determined by the size of the pill  The robot technician  user  or pharmacist determines the needed size of the vial based on the tablet when the robot is stocked  Once the vial is filled it is brought up to a conveyor belt that delivers it to a holder that spins the vial and attaches the patient label  Afterwards it is set on another conveyor that delivers the patient s medication vial to a slot labeled with the patient s name on an LED read out  The pharmacist or technician then checks the contents of the vial to ensure it s the correct drug for the correct patient and then seals the vials and sends it out front to be picked up  The robot is a very time efficient device that the pharmacy depends on to fill prescriptions  McKesson s Robot RX is another healthcare robotics product that helps pharmacies dispense thousands of medications daily with little or no errors  The robot can be ten feet wide and thirty feet long and can hold hundreds of different kinds of medications and thousands of doses  The pharmacy saves many resources like staff members that are otherwise unavailable in a resource scarce industry  It uses an electromechanical head coupled with a pneumatic system to capture each dose and deliver it to its either stocked or dispensed location  The head moves along a single axis while it rotates 180 degrees to pull the medications  During this process it uses barcode technology to verify its pulling the correct drug  It then delivers the drug to a patient specific bin on a conveyor belt  Once the bin is filled with all of the drugs that a particular patient needs and that the robot stocks  the bin is then released and returned out on the conveyor belt to a technician waiting to load it into a cart for delivery to the floor   edit  Research robots See also  Robotics   Robot Research While most robots today are installed in factories or homes  performing labour or life saving jobs  many new types of robot are being developed in laboratories around the world  Much of the research in robotics focuses not on specific industrial tasks  but on investigations into new types of robot  alternative ways to think about or design robots  and new ways to manufacture them  It is expected that these new types of robot will be able to solve real world problems when they are finally realized  citation needed  Nanorobots Further information  Nanorobotics A microfabricated electrostatic gripper holding some silicon nanowires  114  Nanorobotics is the emerging technology field of creating machines or robots whose components are at or close to the microscopic scale of a nanometer  10 9 meters   Also known as  nanobots  or  nanites   they would be constructed from molecular machines  So far  researchers have mostly produced only parts of these complex systems  such as bearings  sensors  and synthetic molecular motors  but functioning robots have also been made such as the entrants to the Nanobot Robocup contest  115  Researchers also hope to be able to create entire robots as small as viruses or bacteria  which could perform tasks on a tiny scale  Possible applications include micro surgery  on the level of individual cells   utility fog  116  manufacturing  weaponry and cleaning  117  Some people have suggested that if there were nanobots which could reproduce  the earth would turn into  grey goo   while others argue that this hypothetical outcome is nonsense  118  119  Reconfigurable Robots Main article  Self reconfiguring modular robot A few researchers have investigated the possibility of creating robots which can alter their physical form to suit a particular task  120  like the fictional T 1000  Real robots are nowhere near that sophisticated however  and mostly consist of a small number of cube shaped units  which can move relative to their neighbours  Algorithms have been designed in case any such robots become a reality  121  Soft Robots Robots with silicone bodies and flexible actuators  air muscles  electroactive polymers  and ferrofluids   controlled using fuzzy logic and neural networks  look and feel different from robots with rigid skeletons  and can have different behaviors  122  Swarm robots Main article  Swarm robotics A swarm of robots from the open source micro robotic project Inspired by colonies of insects such as ants and bees  researchers are modeling the behavior of swarms of thousands of tiny robots which together perform a useful task  such as finding something hidden  cleaning  or spying  Each robot is quite simple  but the emergent behavior of the swarm is more complex  The whole set of robots can be considered as one single distributed system  in the same way an ant colony can be considered a superorganism  exhibiting swarm intelligence  The largest swarms so far created include the iRobot swarm  the SRI MobileRobots CentiBots project 123  and the Open source Micro robotic Project swarm  which are being used to research collective behaviors  124  125  Swarms are also more resistant to failure  Whereas one large robot may fail and ruin a mission  a swarm can continue even if several robots fail  This could make them attractive for space exploration missions  where failure is normally extremely costly  126  Haptic interface robots Further information  Haptic technology Robotics also has application in the design of virtual reality interfaces  Specialized robots are in widespread use in the haptic research community  These robots  called  haptic interfaces   allow touch enabled user interaction with real and virtual environments  Robotic forces allow simulating the mechanical properties of  virtual  objects  which users can experience through their sense of touch  127   edit  Entertainment Poledancing robots Some robots are used for entertainment and as a demonstration of the newest thechnology  This nimble automoton is a perfect example of this process  Being the main attractions at Ce BIT  the world s biggest IT trade fair in Hanover  Germany  128   edit  Future development Further information  Future of robotics  edit  Technological trends Various techniques have emerged to develop the science of robotics and robots  One method is evolutionary robotics  in which a number of differing robots are submitted to tests  Those which perform best are used as a model to create a subsequent  generation  of robots  Another method is developmental robotics  which tracks changes and development within a single robot in the areas of problem solving and other functions   edit  Technological development Overall trends Japan hopes to have full scale commercialization of service robots by 2025  Much technological research in Japan is led by Japanese government agencies  particularly the Trade Ministry  129  As robots become more advanced  eventually there may be a standard computer operating system designed mainly for robots  Robot Operating System is an open source set of programs being developed at Stanford University  the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Technical University of Munich  Germany  among others  ROS provides ways to program a robot s navigation and limbs regardless of the specific hardware involved  It also provides high level commands for items like image recognition and even opening doors  When ROS boots up on a robot s computer  it would obtain data on attributes such as the length and movement of robots  limbs  It would relay this data to higher level algorithms  Microsoft is also developing a  Windows for robots  system with its Robotics Developer Studio  which has been available since 2007  130  New functions and abilities The Caterpillar Company is making a dump truck which can drive itself without any human operator  131  Many future applications of robotics seem obvious to people  even though they are well beyond the capabilities of robots available at the time of the prediction  As early as 1982 people were confident that someday robots would  132  1  clean parts by removing molding flash 2  spray paint automobiles with absolutely no human presence 3  pack things in boxes for example  orient and nest chocolate candies in candy boxes 4  make electrical cable harness 5  load trucks with boxes a packing problem 6  handle soft goods  such as garments and shoes 7  shear sheep 8  prosthesis 9  cook fast food and work in other service

actuators and unpredictably complex behavior can cause harm  for instance by stepping on a human s foot or falling on a human  Most industrial robots operate inside a security fence which separates them from human workers  but not all  Four robot caused deaths are those of Robert Williams  Kenji Urada  Wayne Lucio  and an unnamed worker  Robert Williams was struck by a robotic arm at a casting plant in Flat Rock  Michigan on January 25  1979  134 Kenji Urada  a 37 year old Japanese factory worker  was killed in 1981  Urada was performing routine maintenance on the robot  but neglected to shut it down properly  and it pushed him into a grinding machine  135  Wayne Lucio  a 31 year old Frito Lay worker  died when he tried to adjust a pallet when an Automatic Guided Vehicle that did not sense a forklift  pinned Lucio between the two  136  An unnamed contractor died when his car was crushed by debris when an Automated Storage and Retrieval System  AS RS  collapse ignited a fire that burned for three weeks and destroyed the building in which an estimated 108 million pounds of paper were stored  137   edit  Robotic devices Manuel De Landa has noted that  smart missiles  and autonomous bombs equipped with artificial perception can be considered robots  and they make some of their decisions autonomously  He believes this represents an important and dangerous trend in which humans are handing over important decisions to machines  138   edit  Relationship to unemployment Further information  Structural unemployment Some analysts  such as Martin Ford  author of The Lights in the Tunnel  Automation  Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future 139  argue that robots and other forms of automation will ultimately result in significant unemployment as machines begin to match and exceed the capability of workers to perform most jobs  citation needed  At present the negative impact is only on menial and repetitive jobs  and there is actually a positive impact on the number of jobs for highly skilled technicians  engineers  and specialists  However  these highly skilled jobs are not sufficient in number to offset the greater decrease in employment among the general population  causing structural unemployment in which overall  net  unemployment rises  citation needed  A recent example of human replacement involves Taiwanese technology company Foxconn who  in July 2011  announced a three year plan to replace workers with more robots  At present the company uses ten thousand robots but will increase them to a million robots over a three year period  140  Service robots of different varieties including medical robots  underwater robots  surveillance robots  demolition robots and other types of robots that carry out a multitude of jobs are gaining in numbers  Service robots are everyday tools for mankind  They can clean floors  mow lawns and guard homes and will also assist old and handicapped people  do some surgeries  inspect pipes and sites that are hazardous to people  fight fires and defuse bombs  141  Past responses to train humans for higher levels of technological work may have increased human labor jobs for unskilled workers in general and skilled workers also but that method does not seem to be viable now in industrial societies  Humans collecting on a toll road for instance in some countries are replaced by robots doing that job and though it may be an idea for a trained worker  say perhaps the former human toll taker doing the job to fix and program the new toll collecting robots  it never really works out that way since not as many people are needed to make or program the robots as the robots replace  142   edit  Robots in popular culture  edit  Literature Main article  Robots in literature See also  List of fictional robots and androids Robotic characters  androids  artificial men women  or gynoids  artificial women   and cyborgs  also  bionic men women   or humans with significant mechanical enhancements  have become a staple of science fiction  The first reference in Western literature to mechanical servants appears in Homer s Iliad  In Book XVIII  Hephaestus  god of fire  creates new armor for the hero Achilles  assisted by robots  143  According to the Rieu translation   Golden maidservants hastened to help their master  They looked like real women and could not only speak and use their limbs but were endowed with intelligence and trained in handwork by the immortal gods   Of course  the words  robot  or  android  are not used to describe them  but they are nevertheless mechanical devices human in appearance   The first use of the word Robot was in Karel  apek s play R U R   Rossum s Universal Robots   written in 1920    Writer Karel  apek was born in Czechoslovakia  Czech Republic   Possibly the most prolific authors of the twentieth century was Isaac Asimov  1920 1992  144  who published over five hundred books  145  Asimov is probably best remembered for his science fiction stories and especially those about robots  where he placed robots and their interaction with society at the center of many of his works  146  147  Asimov carefully considered the problem of the ideal set of instructions robots might be given in order to lower the risk to humans  and arrived at his Three Laws of Robotics  a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm  a robot must obey orders given to it by human beings  except where such orders would conflict with the First Law  and a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law  148  These were introduced in his 1942 short story  Runaround   although foreshadowed in a few earlier stories  Later  Asimov added the Zeroth Law   A robot may not harm humanity  or  by inaction  allow humanity to come to harm   the rest of the laws are modified sequentially to acknowledge this  According to the Oxford English Dictionary  the first passage in Asimov s short story  Liar    1941  that mentions the First Law is the earliest recorded use of the word robotics  Asimov was not initially aware of this  he assumed the word already existed by analogy with mechanics  hydraulics  and other similar terms denoting branches of applied knowledge  149   edit  Problems depicted in popular culture Fears and concerns about robots have been repeatedly expressed in a wide range of books and films  A common theme is the development of a master race of conscious and highly intelligent robots  motivated to take over or destroy the human race   See The Terminator  Runaway  Blade Runner  RoboCop  the Replicators in Stargate  the Cylons in Battlestar Galactica  The Matrix  Enthiran and I  Robot   Some fictional robots are programmed to kill and destroy  others gain superhuman intelligence and abilities by upgrading their own software and hardware  Examples of popular media where the robot becomes evil are 2001  A Space Odyssey  Red Planet and Enthiran  Another common theme is the reaction  sometimes called the  uncanny valley   of unease and even revulsion at the sight of robots that mimic humans too closely  52 Frankenstein  1818   often called the first science fiction novel  has become synonymous with the theme of a robot or monster advancing beyond its creator  In the TV show  Futurama  the robots are portrayed as humanoid figures that live alongside humans  not as robotic butlers  They still work in industry  but these robots carry out daily lives  Other problems may include events pertaining to robot surrogates  i e the movie Surrogates  where tissue of living organisms is interchanged with robotic systems  These problems can leave many possibilities where electronic viruses or an electro magnetic pulse  EMP  can destroy not only the robot but kill the host operator as well   edit  See also Robotics portal Outline of robotics Glossary of robotics Index
