was once called Itchyma  after its original inhabitants  However  even before the Inca occupation of the area in the 15th century  a famous oracle in the R mac valley had come to be known by visitors as limaq  limaq  pronounced   lim q   which means  talker  in coastal Quechua   This oracle was eventually destroyed by the Spanish and replaced with a church  but the name persisted in the local language  thus the chronicles show  L mac  replacing  Ychma  as the common name for the area  2  Modern scholars speculate that the word  Lima  originated as the Spanish pronunciation of the native name Limaq  Linguistic evidence seems to support this theory as spoken Spanish consistently rejects stop consonants in word final position  The city was founded in 1535 under the name City of the Kings  Spanish  Ciudad de los Reyes  because its foundation was decided on January 6  date of the feast of the Epiphany  Nevertheless  this name quickly fell into disuse and Lima became the city s name of choice  on the oldest Spanish maps of Peru  both Lima and Ciudad de los Reyes can be seen together as names for the city  The river that feeds Lima is called R mac  and many people erroneously assume that this is because its original Inca name is  Talking River   the Incas spoke a highland variety of Quechua where the word for  talker  was pronounced   rim q    citation needed  However  the original inhabitants of the valley were not the Incas  and this name is actually an innovation arising from an effort by the Cuzco nobility in colonial times to standardize the toponym so that it would conform to the phonology of Cuzco Quechua  Later  as the original inhabitants of the valley died out and the local Quechua became extinct  the Cuzco pronunciation prevailed  In modern times  Spanish speaking locals do not see the connection between the name of their city and the name of the river that runs through it  They often assume that the valley is named after the river  however  Spanish documents from the colonial period show the opposite to be true  2   edit  History Main article  History of Lima Pachacamac was an important religious centre before the arrival of Spanish conquistadors In the pre Columbian era  the location of what is now the city of Lima was inhabited by several Amerindian groups under the Ychsma polity  which was incorporated into the Inca Empire in the 15th century  3  In 1532  a group of Spanish conquistadors led by Francisco Pizarro defeated the Inca ruler Atahualpa and took over his Empire  As the Spanish Crown had named Pizarro governor of the lands he conquered  4  he chose the R mac valley to found his capital on January 18  1535 as Ciudad de los Reyes  City of the Kings   5  In August 1536  rebel Inca troops led by Manco Inca besieged the city but were defeated by the Spaniards and their native allies  6  Lima gained prestige after being designated capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru and site of a Real Audiencia in 1543  7  During the next century it flourished as the centre of an extensive trade network which integrated the Viceroyalty with the rest of the Americas  Europe and the Far East  8  However  the city was not free from dangers  the presence of pirates and privateers in the Pacific Ocean lead to the building of the Lima City Walls between 1684 and 1687  9  Also in this last year a powerful earthquake destroyed most of the city buildings  10  the earthquake marked a turning point in the history of Lima as it coincided with a recession in trade and growing economic competition with other cities such as Buenos Aires  11  Balconies were a major feature of Lima s architecture during the colonial period  In 1746  a powerful earthquake severely damaged Lima and destroyed Callao  forcing a massive rebuilding effort under Viceroy Jos  Antonio Manso de Velasco  12  In the later half of the 18th century  Enlightenment ideas on public health and social control shaped the development of the city  13  During this period  Lima was adversely affected by the Bourbon Reforms as it lost its monopoly on overseas trade and its control over the important mining region of Upper Peru  14  The city s economic decline made its elite dependent on royal and ecclesiastical appointment and thus  reluctant to advocate independence  15  A combined expedition of Argentine and Chilean patriots under General Jos  de San Mart n landed south of Lima in 1820 but did not attack the city  Faced with a naval blockade and the action of guerrillas on land  Viceroy Jos  de la Serna evacuated its capital on July 1821 to save the Royalist army  16  Fearing a popular uprising and lacking any means to impose order  the city council invited San Mart n to enter Lima and signed a Declaration of Independence at his request  17  However  the war was not over  in the next two years the city changed hands several times  Lima City Walls were built between 1684 and 1687 by viceroy Melchor de Navarra y Rocafull  After independence  Lima became the capital of the Republic of Peru but economic stagnation and political turmoil brought urban development to a halt  This hiatus ended in the 1850s  when increased public and private revenues from guano exports led to a rapid development of the city  18  The export led expansion also widened the gap between rich and poor  fostering social unrest  19  During the 1879 1883 War of the Pacific  Chilean troops occupied Lima  looting public museums  libraries and educational institutions  20  At the same time  angry mobs attacked wealthy citizens and the Asian population  sacking their properties and businesses  21  After the war  the city underwent a process of renewal and expansion from the 1890s up to the 1920s  During this period  the urban layout was modified by the construction of big avenues that crisscrossed the city and connected it with neighboring towns  22  In 1940  an earthquake destroyed most of the city  which at that time was mostly built of adobe and quincha  In the 1940s  Lima started a period of rapid growth spurred by migration from the Andean regions of Peru  as rural people sought opportunities for work and education  The population  estimated at 0 6 million in 1940  reached 1 9 million by 1960 and 4 8 million by 1980  23  At the start of this period  the urban area was confined to a triangular area bounded by the city s historic centre  Callao and Chorrillos  in the following decades settlements spread to the north  beyond the R mac River  to the east  along the Central Highway  and to the south  24  The new migrants  at first confined to slums in downtown Lima  led this expansion through large scale land invasions  which evolved into shanty towns  known as pueblos j venes  25   edit  Geography Lima seen from the SPOT satellite The urban area of Lima covers about 800 km2  310 sq mi   It is located on mostly flat terrain in the Peruvian coastal plain  within the valleys of the Chill n  R mac and Lur n rivers  The city slopes gently from the shores of the Pacific Ocean into valleys and mountain slopes located as high as 500 metres  1 600 ft  above mean sea level  Within the city there are isolated hills which are not connected to the surrounding hill chains  such as El Agustino  San Cosme  El Pino  La Milla  Muleria and Pro hills  The San Cristobal hill in the Rimac district  which lies directly north of the downtown area  is the local extreme of an Andean hill outgrowth  Metropolitan Lima has an area of 2 672 28 km2  1 031 77 sq mi   of which 825 88 km2  318 87 sq mi   31   comprise the actual city and 1 846 40 km2  712 90 sq mi   69   the city outskirts  citation needed  The urban area extends around 60 km  37 mi  from north to south and around 30 km  19 mi  from west to east  The city center is located 15 km  9 3 mi  inland at the shore of the Rimac river  a vital resource for the city  since it carries what will become drinking water for its inhabitants and fuels the hydroelectric dams that provide electricity to the area  While no official administrative definition for the city exists  it is usually considered to be composed of the central 30 out of the 43 districts of Lima Province  corresponding to an urban area centered around the historic Cercado de Lima district  citation needed  The city is the core of the Lima Metropolitan Area  one of the ten largest metropolitan areas in the Americas  Lima is the second largest city in the world located in a desert  after Cairo  Egypt   edit  Climate Weather averages for Lima International Airport Lima s climate is mild and comfortable  despite being located in the tropics and in a desert  Although classified as subtropical  Lima s proximity to the cool waters of the Pacific Ocean leads to temperatures much cooler than those expected for a subtropical desert  and can be classified as a cool desert climate  It is neither cold nor very hot  Temperatures rarely fall below 12  C  54  F  or rise above 29  C  84  F  throughout the entire year  Two distinct seasons can be identified  summer  from December through April  and winter from June through October  May and November are generally transition months  with the warm to cool weather transition being more dramatic  Summers are warm  humid and sunny  Daily temperatures oscillate between lows of 18  C  64  F  to 22  C  72  F   and highs of 24  C  75  F  to 29  C  84  F   Skies are generally cloud free  especially during daytime  Occasional coastal fogs during some mornings and high clouds during some afternoons and evenings can be present  Lima summer sunsets are well known for being colorful  As such  they have been labeled by the locals as  cielo de brujas   Spanish for  sky of witches    since the sky commonly turns into shades of orange  pink and red around 7 pm  Winter weather is dramatically different  Gray skies  breezy conditions  high humidity and cool temperatures prevail  Long  1 week or more  stretches of dark overcast skies are not uncommon  Persistent morning drizzle occurs occasionally from June through September  coating the streets with a thin layer of water that generally dries up by early afternoon  Winter temperatures in Lima do not vary much between day and night  They range from lows of 12  C  54  F  to 16  C  61  F  and highs of 16  C  61  F  to 19  C  66  F   rarely exceeding 20  C  68  F  except in the easternmost districts  26  Relative humidity is always very high  particularly in the mornings  26  High humidity produces brief morning fog during the early summer and a usually persistent low cloud deck during the winter  generally developing in May and persisting all the way into late November or even early December   Predominant onshore flow makes the Lima area one of the cloudiest among the entire Peruvian coast  Lima has only 1284 hours of sunshine a year  28 6 hours in July and 179 1 hours in January  exceptionally low values for the latitude  27  Winter cloudiness prompts locals to seek for sunshine in Andean valleys located at elevations generally above 500 meters above sea level  Although relative humidity levels are high  rainfall is very low due to strong atmospheric stability  The severely low rainfall impacts on water supply in the city  which originates from wells and from rivers that flow from the Andes  28  Inland districts receive anywhere between 1 to 6 cm  2 4 in  of rainfall per year  which accumulates mainly during the winter months  Coastal districts receive only 1 to 3 cm  1 2 in   As previously mentioned  winter precipitation occurs in the form of persistent morning drizzle events  These are locally called  gar a    llovizna  or  camanchacas   Summer rain  on the other hand  is infrequent  and occurs in the form of isolated light and brief showers  These generally occur during afternoons and evenings when leftovers from Andean storms arrive from the east  The lack of heavy rainfall arises from high atmospheric stability caused  in term  by the combination of cool waters from semi permanent coastal upwelling and the presence of the cold Humboldt Current  and warm air aloft associated with the South Pacific anticyclone  The climate of Lima  as that of most of the Peruvian coast  gets severely disrupted during El Ni o events  Water temperatures along the coast  which usually average around 17 19  C  63 66  F   get much warmer  as in 1998 when the water temperature reached 26  C  79  F    Air temperatures rise accordingly  Such was the case when Lima hit its all time record high of 34  C  93  F   26  Cooler climate develops during La Ni a years  The all time record low in the metropolitan area is 8  C  46  F   measured during the winter of 1988  26  Climate data for Lima Month Jan Feb

everywhere  accounting for a large part of the car stock  In many cases they are just a private car with a taxi sticker on the windshield  Additionally  there are several companies that provide taxi
