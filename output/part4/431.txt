novel Dune by Frank Herbert  Considered by many to be the greatest science fiction novel of all time  1  2 Dune is frequently cited as the best selling science fiction novel in history  2  3 Dune won the 1966 Hugo Award and the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel  4  5  and was later adapted into a 1984 film as well as a 2000 television miniseries  Herbert wrote five sequels  and the first two were presented as a miniseries in 2003  The Dune universe has also inspired some traditional games and a series of video games  Since 2009  the names of planets from the Dune novels have been adopted for the real world nomenclature of plains and other features on Saturn s moon Titan  6  7  8  Herbert himself died in 1986  9  Beginning in 1999  his son Brian Herbert and science fiction author Kevin J  Anderson have published a number of prequel novels  as well as two which complete the original Dune series   Hunters of Dune  2006  and Sandworms of Dune  2007    partially based on Frank Herbert s notes discovered a decade after his death  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  The political  scientific  and social fictional setting of Herbert s novels and derivative works is known as the Dune universe  or Duniverse  17  Set tens of thousands of years in the future  the saga chronicles a civilization which has banned artificial intelligence but has also developed advanced technology and mental and physical abilities  Vital to this empire is the harsh desert planet Arrakis  only known source of the spice melange  the most valuable substance in the universe  Contents 1 Development and publication

setting of Dune and its challenges is attributed to research he began in 1957 for a never completed article about a United States Department of Agriculture experiment using poverty grasses to stabilize damaging sand dunes  which could  swallow whole cities  lakes  rivers  highways   18  Herbert spent the next five years researching  writing  and revising what would eventually become the novel Dune  18  which was initially serialized in Analog magazine as two shorter works  Dune World  1963  and The Prophet of Dune  1965   19  The serialized version was expanded and reworked   and rejected by more than twenty publishers   before being published by Chilton Books  a little known printing house best known for its auto repair manuals  in 1965  20 Dune won the 1966 Hugo Award and the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel  4  5  A sequel  Dune Messiah  followed in 1969  A third novel called Children of Dune was published in 1976  and was later nominated for a Hugo Award  21 Children of Dune became the first hardcover best seller ever in the science fiction field  22  In 1981 Herbert released God Emperor of Dune  which was ranked as the  11 hardcover fiction best seller of 1981 by Publishers Weekly  23  1984 s Heretics of Dune  The New York Times  13 hardcover fiction best seller of that year  24  was followed in quick succession by Chapterhouse  Dune in 1985  Herbert died on February 11  1986  9   edit  Prelude to Dune Over a decade after Herbert s death  his son Brian Herbert enlisted science fiction author Kevin J  Anderson to coauthor a trilogy of Dune prequel novels that would come to be called the Prelude to Dune series  14  Using some of Frank Herbert s own notes  14  12  the duo wrote Dune  House Atreides  1999   Dune  House Harkonnen  2000   and Dune  House Corrino  2001   The series is set in the years immediately prior to the events of Dune   edit  Legends of Dune Herbert and Anderson followed with a second prequel trilogy called the Legends of Dune  consisting of Dune  The Butlerian Jihad  2002   Dune  The Machine Crusade  2003   and Dune  The Battle of Corrin  2004   This series is set during the Butlerian Jihad  an element of back story which Frank Herbert had previously established as occurring 10 000 years before the events chronicled in Dune  25  Herbert s brief description of mankind s  crusade against computers  thinking machines  and conscious robots  26  was expanded by Brian Herbert and Anderson into a violent and generations spanning war between humans and sentient machines  25   edit  Completion of the original series  Dune 7  With an outline for the first book of Prelude to Dune series written and a proposal sent to publishers  13  Brian Herbert had discovered his father s 30 page outline for a sequel to Chapterhouse Dune which the elder Herbert had dubbed Dune 7  11  After publishing their six prequel novels  Brian Herbert and Anderson released Hunters of Dune  2006  and Sandworms of Dune  2007   which complete the chronological progression of the original series and wrap up storylines that began with Frank Herbert s Heretics of Dune   edit  Heroes of Dune In the foreword to Hunters of Dune  2006   Brian Herbert and Kevin J  Anderson wrote that they planned to continue writing Dune novels after completing the Dune 7 project  In 2006 they announced that after Sandworms of Dune they would release an interquel series of novels called Paul of Dune  27  28  which was renamed Heroes of Dune in 2007  29 Heroes of Dune focuses on the time periods between Frank Herbert s original novels  14  27  30  31  the first book  Paul of Dune  was published on September 16  2008  32 The Winds of Dune  called Jessica of Dune before publication  29  30  was released on August 4  2009  33  The next two installments were to be called The Throne of Dune 34   formerly Irulan of Dune  29  30  and Leto of Dune  possibly changing to The Golden Path of Dune   34  However  in a July 15  2010 blog post  Anderson announced that these novels had been postponed due to plans by Herbert and Anderson to publish a trilogy about  the formation of the Bene Gesserit  the Mentats  the Suk Doctors  the Spacing Guild and the Navigators  as well as the solidifying of the Corrino imperium   35  The first novel in that series  titled The Sisterhood of Dune  was released on January 3  2012  35   edit  Short stories In 1985  Frank Herbert wrote an illustrated short work called  The Road to Dune   set sometime between the events of Dune and Dune Messiah  Published in Herbert s short story collection Eye  it takes the form of a guidebook for pilgrims to Arrakis and features images  with descriptions  of some of the devices and characters presented in the novels  36  Brian Herbert and Anderson have written several Dune short stories  most of them related to and published around their novels  The stories include  Dune  A Whisper of Caladan Seas   2001    Dune  Hunting Harkonnens   2002    Dune  Whipping Mek   2003    Dune  The Faces of a Martyr   2004    Dune  Sea Child   2006   and  Dune  Treasure in the Sand   2006    edit  Derivative works  edit  Film and television adaptations In 1984

of Dune  1984  and Chapterhouse  Dune  1985  by Frank Herbert  Hunters of Dune  2006  and Sandworms of Dune  2007  by Brian Herbert and Anderson  edit  The Butlerian Jihad As explained in Dune  the Butlerian Jihad is a conflict taking place over 11 000 years in the future 53   and over 10 000 years before the events of Dune  which results in the total destruction of virtually all forms of  computers  thinking machines  and conscious robots   26  With the prohibition  Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind   the creation of even the simplest thinking machines is outlawed and made taboo  which has a profound influence on the socio political and technological development of humanity in the Dune series  26  Herbert refers to the Jihad several times in the novels  but does not give much detail on how he imagined the causes and nature of the conflict  25  In Herbert s God Emperor of Dune  1981   Leto Atreides II indicates that the Jihad had been a semi religious social upheaval initiated by humans who felt repulsed by how guided and controlled they had become by machines   The target of the Jihad was a machine attitude as much as the machines   Leto said   Humans had set those machines to usurp our sense of beauty  our necessary selfdom out of which we make living judgments  Naturally  the machines were destroyed   54  This technological reversal leads to the creation of the universal Orange Catholic Bible and the rise of a new feudal galactic empire which lasts for over 10 000 years before Herbert s series begins  55  56  Several secret societies also develop  using eugenics programs  intensive mental and physical training  and pharmaceutical enhancements to hone human skills to an astonishing degree  55 Artificial insemination is also prohibited  as explained in Dune Messiah  1969  when Paul Atreides negotiates with the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam  who is appalled by Paul s suggestion that he impregnate his consort in this manner  57  The Dune Encyclopedia  1984  by Willis E  McNelly  and approved by Frank Herbert  presents an extended chronicle of the Butlerian Jihad  58  According to McNelly  he and Herbert had planned to expand this version into a prequel novel to Dune  59  Herbert s death in 1986 9  60  left this project abandoned  59  and Herbert s own vision of the actual events of the Butlerian Jihad unexplored and open to speculation  25  The Legends of Dune prequel trilogy  2002 2004  by Brian Herbert and Kevin J  Anderson presents the Jihad as a war between humans and the sentient machines they had created  who rise up and nearly destroy mankind  61  The series explains that mankind had become entirely complacent and dependent upon thinking machines  recognizing this weakness  a group of ambitious  militant humans calling themselves the Titans use this widespread reliance on machine intelligence to seize control of the entire universe  61  Their reign lasts for a century  eventually they give too much access and power to the AI program Omnius  which usurps control from the Titans themselves  25  61  Seeing no value in human life  the thinking machines   now including armies of robot soldiers and other aggressive machines   dominate and enslave nearly all of humanity in the universe for 900 years  until a jihad is ignited  25  This crusade against the machines lasts for nearly a century  with much loss of human life but ultimately ending in human victory  61   edit  The Corrino led Imperium Padishah Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV greets a Spacing Guild Navigator in David Lynch s Dune  1984  The ancient Battle of Corrin   occurring 20 years after the end of the Butlerian Jihad   spawns the Padishah Emperors of House Corrino  who rule the known universe for millennia by controlling the brutally efficient military force known as the Imperial Sardaukar  Ten thousand years later  one balance to Imperial power is the assembly of noble houses called the Landsraad  which enforces the Great Convention s ban on the use of atomics against human targets  Though the power of the Corrinos is unrivaled by any individual House  they are in constant competition with each other for political power and stakes in the omnipresent CHOAM company  a directorship which controls the wealth of the entire Old Empire  The third primary power in the universe is the Spacing Guild  which monopolizes interstellar travel and banking  Mutated Guild Navigators use the spice drug melange to successfully navigate  folded space  and safely guide enormous heighliner starships from planet to planet instantaneously  55  62  Reverend Mother Mohiam  Si n Phillips  and other Bene Gesserit  from David Lynch s Dune  1984  The matriarchal Bene Gesserit possess almost superhuman physical  sensory  and deductive powers developed through years of physical and mental conditioning  While positioning themselves to  serve  mankind  the Bene Gesserit pursue their goal to better the human race by subtly and secretly guiding and manipulating the affairs of others to serve their own purposes  The Bene Gesserit also have a secret  millennia long selective breeding program to bolster and preserve valuable skills and bloodlines as well as to produce a theoretical superhuman male they call the Kwisatz Haderach  By the time of Dune  the Sisterhood are only one generation away from their desired individual  having manipulated the threads of genes and power for thousands of years to produce the required confluence of events  But Lady Jessica  ordered by the Bene Gesserit to produce a daughter who would breed with the appropriate male to produce the Kwisatz Haderach  instead bears a son    unintentionally producing the Kwisatz Haderach a generation early  55   Human computers  known as Mentats have been developed and perfected to replace the capacity for logical analysis lost through the prohibition of computers  Through specific training  they learn to enter a heightened mental state in which they can perform complex logical computations that are superior to those of the ancient thinking machines  The patriarchal Bene Tleilax  or Tleilaxu  are amoral merchants who traffic in biological and genetically engineered products such as artificial eyes   twisted  Mentats  and gholas  Finally  the Ixians produce cutting edge technology that seemingly complies with  but pushes the boundaries of  the prohibitions against thinking machines  The Ixians are very secretive  not only to protect their valuable hold on the industry but also to hide any methods or inventions that may breach the anti thinking machine protocols  55  Against this backdrop  the Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy  1999 2001  chronicles the return from obscurity of House Atreides  whose role in the Butlerian Jihad is all but forgotten  The Imperial House schemes to gain full control of the Empire through the control of melange  precisely at the time that the Bene Gesserit breeding program is nearing fruition  63   edit  The ascension of the Atreides As Frank Herbert s Dune  1965  begins  Duke Leto Atreides finds himself in a dangerous position  the 81st Padishah Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV has put him in control of the desert planet Arrakis  known as Dune  which is the only natural source of the all important spice melange  The most valuable commodity in the known universe  the spice not only makes safe and reliable interstellar travel possible  but also prolongs life  protects against disease  and is used by the Bene Gesserit to enhance their abilities  The potential financial gains for House Atreides are mitigated by the fact that mining melange from the desert surface of Arrakis is an expensive and hazardous undertaking  thanks to the treacherous environment and constant threat of giant sandworms which protect the spice  In addition  Leto is aware that Shaddam  threatened by the rising power and influence of the Atreides  has sent him into a trap  failure to meet or exceed the production volume of their predecessors  the vicious House Harkonnen  will negatively affect the position of House Atreides in CHOAM  which relies on spice profits  55  Further  the very presence of the Atreides on Arrakis inflames the long simmering War of Assassins between House Atreides and House Harkonnen  a feud ignited 10 000 years before when an Atreides had a Harkonnen banished for cowardice after the Butlerian Jihad  64  65  The little understood native population of Arrakis are the Fremen  long overlooked by the Imperium  Considered backward savages  the Fremen are an extremely hardy people and exist in large numbers  their culture built around the commodity of water  which is extremely scarce on Arrakis  The Fremen await the coming of a prophesied messiah  not suspecting that this prophecy had been planted in their legends by the Missionaria Protectiva  an arm of the Bene Gesserit dedicated to religious manipulation to ease the path of the Sisterhood when necessary  In Dune  the so called  Arrakis Affair  puts unexpected Kwisatz Haderach Paul Atreides in control of first the Fremen people and then Arrakis itself  he deposes Shaddam and becomes ruler of the known universe  55  With a bloody jihad subsequently unleashed across the universe in Paul s name but out of his control  the Bene Gesserit  Tleilaxu  Spacing Guild  and House Corrino plot to dethrone him in Dune Messiah  1969   57  The Atreides Empire continues to devolve in Children of Dune  1976  as the religion built around Paul falters and his heirs rise to power  66  The Heroes of Dune interquel series  2008 present  by Brian Herbert and Kevin J  Anderson follows events involving the Atreides before  between  and after Dune  Dune Messiah  and Children of Dune  67   edit  The reign and fall of the God Emperor Leto II as God Emperor  from the cover of God Emperor of Dune  1981  At the time of God Emperor of Dune  1981   Paul s son  the God Emperor Leto Atreides II  has ruled the Empire for 3 500 years from the verdant face of a transformed Arrakis  melange production has ceased  Leto has forced the sandworms into extinction  except for the larval sandtrout with which he had forged a symbiosis  transforming him into a human sandworm hybrid  Human civilization before his rule had suffered from twin weaknesses  that it could be controlled by a single authority  and that it was totally dependent upon melange  found on only one planet in the known universe  Leto s prescient visions had shown that mankind would be threatened by extinction in any number of ways  his solution was to place mankind on his  Golden Path   a plan for humanity s survival  Leto governs as a benevolent tyrant  providing for his people s physical needs  but denying them any spiritual outlets other than his own compulsory religion  as well as maintaining a monopoly on spice and thus total control of its use   Personal violence of any kind is banned  as is nearly all space travel  creating a pent up demand for freedom and travel  The Bene Gesserit  Ixians  and Tleilaxu find themselves seeking ways to regain some of their former power or unseat Leto altogether  Leto also conducts his own selective breeding program among the descendants of his twin sister Ghanima  finally arriving at Siona  daughter of Moneo  whose actions are hidden from prescient vision  Leto engineers his own assassination  knowing it will result in rebellion and revolt but also in an explosion in travel and colonization  The death of Leto s body also produces new sandtrout  which will eventually give rise to a population of sandworms and a new cycle of spice production  54   edit  The return from the Scattering In the aftermath of the fall of the God Emperor  chaos and severe famine on many worlds cause trillions of humans to set off into the freedom of unknown space and spread out across the universe  This diaspora is later called the Scattering and  combined with the invisibility of Atreides descendants to prescient vision  assures that mankind has forever escaped the threat of total extinction  At the time of Heretics of Dune  1984  and Chapterhouse  Dune  1985    1500 years after Leto s death   the turmoil is settling into a new pattern  the balance of power in the Empire rests among the Ixians  the Bene Gesserit  and the Tleilaxu  The Spacing Guild has been forever weakened by the development of Ixian machines capable of navigation in foldspace  practically replacing Guild Navigators  The Bene Gesserit control the sandworms and their planet  now called Rakis  but the Tleilaxu have also discovered how to synthetically produce melange  This balance of power is shattered by a large influx of people from the Scattering  some fleeing persecution by an as yet unknown enemy  Among the returning people  the Bene Gesserit finds its match in a violent and corrupt matriarchal society known as the Honored Matres  whom they suspect may be descended from some of their own sent out in the Scattering  As a bitter and bloody war erupts between the orders  it ultimately becomes clear that joining the two organizations into a single New Sisterhood with shared abilities is their best chance to fight the approaching enemy  68  69   edit  Chronology Chronology of Dune Written Works 70  34  Short Stories Novels  Dune  Hunting Harkonnens  Dune  The Butlerian
