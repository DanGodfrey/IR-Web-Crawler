material may be challenged and removed   July 2007  Indigenous peoples have lived in coastal southern California for at least ten thousand years  Over the centuries  several successive cultures inhabited the present day area of Long Beach  By the time Spanish explorers arrived in the sixteenth century  the dominant group were the Tongva people  They had at least three major settlements within the present day city boundaries  Tevaaxa anga was an inland settlement near the Los Angeles River  while Ahwaanga and Povuu nga were coastal villages  Along with other Tongva villages  they were forced to relocate in the mid 19th century due to missionization  political change  and a drastic drop in population from exposure to European diseases  3  In 1784 the Spanish Empire s King Carlos III granted Rancho Los Nietos to Spanish soldier Manuel Nieto  The Rancho Los Cerritos and Rancho Los Alamitos were divided from this territory  The boundary between the two ranchos ran through the center of Signal Hill on a southwest to northeast diagonal  A portion of western Long Beach was originally part of the Rancho San Pedro  Its boundaries were in dispute for years  due to flooding changing the Los Angeles River boundary  between the ranchos of Juan Jose Dominguez and Manuel Nieto  In 1843 Jonathan Temple bought Rancho Los Cerritos  after arriving in California in 1827 from New England  He built what is now known as the  Los Cerritos Ranch House   an adobe which still stands and is a National Historic Landmark  Temple created a thriving cattle ranch and prospered  becoming the wealthiest man in Los Angeles County  Both Temple and his ranch house played important local roles in the Mexican American War  On an island in the San Pedro Bay  Mormon pioneers made an abortive attempt to establish a colony  as part of Brigham Young s plan to establish a continuous chain of settlements from the Pacific to Salt Lake   Long Beach pier  1905 In 1866 Temple sold Rancho Los Cerritos for  20 000 to the Northern California sheep raising firm of Flint  Bixby  amp  Co  which consisted of brothers Thomas and Benjamin Flint and their cousin Lewellyn Bixby  Two years previous Flint  Bixby  amp  Co had also purchased along with Northern California associate James Irvine  three ranchos which would later become the city that bears Irvine s name  To manage Rancho Los Cerritos  the company selected Lewellyn s brother Jotham Bixby  the  Father of Long Beach   Three years later Bixby bought into the property and would later form the Bixby Land Company  In the 1870s as many as 30 000 sheep were kept at the ranch and sheared twice yearly to provide wool for trade  In 1880  Bixby sold 4 000 acres  16 km2  of the Rancho Los Cerritos to William E  Willmore  who subdivided it in hopes of creating a farm community  Willmore City  He failed and was bought out by a Los Angeles syndicate that called itself the  Long Beach Land and Water Company   They changed the name of the community to Long Beach  at that time  The City of Long Beach was officially incorporated in 1897  Long Beach boardwalk  1907 Another Bixby cousin  John W  Bixby  was influential in the city  After first working for his cousins at Los Cerritos  J W  Bixby leased land at Rancho Los Alamitos  He put together a group  banker I W  Hellman  Lewellyn and Jotham Bixby  and him  to purchase the rancho  In addition to bringing innovative farming methods to the Alamitos  which under Abel Stearns in the late 1850s and early 1860s was once the largest cattle ranch in the US   J W  Bixby began the development of the oceanfront property near the city s picturesque bluffs  Under the name Alamitos Land Company  J W  Bixby named the streets and laid out the parks of his new city  This area would include Belmont Heights  Belmont Shore and Naples  it soon became a thriving community of its own  J W  Bixby died in 1888 of apparent appendicitis  The Rancho Los Alamitos property was split up  with Hellman getting the southern third  Jotham and Lewellyn the northern third  and J W  Bixby s widow and heirs keeping the central third  The Alamitos townsite was kept as a separate entity  but it was basically run by Lewellyn and Jotham s Bixby Land Company  When Jotham Bixby died in 1916  the remaining 3 500 acres  14 km2  of Rancho Los Cerritos was subdivided into the neighborhoods of Bixby Knolls  California Heights  North Long Beach and part of the city of Signal Hill  Oil field in Long Beach  1920 The town grew as a seaside resort with light agricultural uses  4 The Pike was the most famous beachside amusement zone on the West Coast from 1902 until 1969  it offered bathers food  games and rides  such at the Dual Ferris Wheel and Cyclone Racer  roller coaster  Gradually the oil industry  Navy shipyard and facilities and port became the mainstays of the city  In the 1950s it was referred to as  Iowa by the sea   due to a large influx of people from that and other Midwestern states  Huge picnics for migrants from each state were a popular annual event in Long Beach until the 1960s  Oil was discovered in 1921 on Signal Hill  which split off as a separate incorporated city shortly afterward  The discovery of the Long Beach Oil Field  brought in by the gusher at the Alamitos No  1 well  made Long Beach a major oil producer  in the 1920s the field was the most productive in the world  5  In 1932  the even larger Wilmington Oil Field  fourth largest in the United States  and which is mostly in Long Beach  was developed  contributing to the city s fame in the 1930s as an oil town  6  The Long Beach earthquake of 1933 was a magnitude 6 3 earthquake that caused significant damage to the city and surrounding areas  killing a total of 120 people  Most of the damage occurred in unreinforced masonry buildings  especially schools  Pacific Bible Seminary  now known as Hope International University  was forced to move classes out of First Christian Church of Long Beach and into a small local home due to damage from the earthquake  7  The new Ford assembly plant in Long Beach  1930 First Christian Church of Long Beach was the site of Pacific Bible Seminary  now called Hope International University  in the early 1930s The city was the site of  The Los Angeles Air Raid of 1942  during World War II  when observers for the Army Air Corps reported shells being fired from the sea  Anti aircraft batteries fired into the night sky  although no planes were ever sighted  Before the war  Long Beach had a sizable Japanese American population  who worked in the fish canneries on Terminal Island and owned small truck  produce  farms in the area  Due to exaggerated fears on the coast and racial prejudice  state officials persuaded the national government to remove Japanese nationals and Japanese Americans for internment in 1942 to inland facilities  Most did not return to the city after their release from the camps  Due to this and other factors  Japanese Americans now make up less than 1  of the population of Long Beach  but the Japanese Community Center and a Japanese Buddhist Church survive  The Japanese American Cultural Center is located over the Gerald Desmond Bridge and the Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro  The nonprofit Aquarium of the Pacific  located in downtown Long Beach  opened to the public in 1998  It has become a major attraction visited by more than 13 million people since its opening  The Aquarium was rated  2 Los Angeles area Family Destination in the most recent Zagat U S  Family Travel Guide  second only to Disneyland  The Aquarium s architecture is inspired by the breaking waves of the Pacific  Kajima International was the developer of the Aquarium of the Pacific and architects included the Los Angeles office of Hellmuth  Obata  amp  Kassanbaum and Esherick Homsey Dodge and Davis of San Francisco  The Aquarium of the Pacific recently made history as the first in the museum  zoo  or aquarium industry to become a Climate Action Leader for voluntarily measuring  certifying  and reporting its green house gas emissions to the Climate Action Registry and the public   edit  Cityscape   The template

is composed of many different neighborhoods  which are variously defined and delineated by residents and the local media  However  the names and boundaries of neighborhoods themselves are not officially recognized by the City  with limited exceptions for statutory purposes  the City does  however  recognize neighborhood advocacy groups representing some of these neighborhoods or portions thereof   Some neighborhoods are named after thoroughfares  while others are named for nearby parks  schools  or city features  They include  alphabetically   4th Street Corridor Alamitos Beach North

Angeles  According to the United States Census Bureau  the city has a total area of 51 437 square miles  133 2 km2   with 50 293 square miles  130 3 km2  of its area being land and 1 144 square miles  2 96 km2  of it  2 22   is water  Long Beach completely surrounds the city of Signal Hill   edit  Climate Long Beach  depending on the reporting location  has a Mediterranean climate  with strongly semi arid climate characteristics  Due to its proximity to the Pacific Ocean  temperatures in Long Beach are moderate throughout the year  Temperatures recorded at the weather station at the Long Beach Airport  4 0 miles  6 4 km  inland from the ocean  range more greatly than those along the immediate coast  During the summer months  low clouds and fog occur frequently  developing overnight and blanketing the area on many mornings  This fog usually clears by the afternoon  and a westerly sea breeze often develops  keeping temperatures mild  Heat and humidity rarely coincide  making heat waves more tolerable than they would be otherwise  Long Beach s geographic location directly east of the Palos Verdes Peninsula  paired with its mostly south facing coastline  results in the community having significantly different weather patterns than coastal communities to the north and south  The 1200  Palos Verdes hills block east to west airflow and  with it  a significant amount of the coastal moisture that marks other Los Angeles County coastal cities  such as Manhattan Beach and Santa Monica  As in most locations in southern California  rainfall occurs largely during the winter months  Storms can bring heavy rainfall  but Long Beach receives less precipitation than locations adjacent to the San Gabriel or San Bernardino mountains further inland  whose rainfall is enhanced by

air pollution in southern California and the United States  Most of the city is in close proximity to the twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach  and the prevailing westerly to west south westerly winds bring a large portion of the twin ports  air pollution directly into Long Beach before dispersing it northward then eastward over Whittier  Covina  Pomona  and Riverside  11  Port of Long Beach is considered the  Green Port   Ships must  swicth over  from IFO  low sulphur fuel oil  to MGO  Marine Gas Oil  24 nautical miles from the outer islands  Once alongside ships burn MGO or MDO for their generators  The port has also enforced trucks to modify older engines to burn  clean   Similarly  the water quality in the Long Beach portion of San Pedro Bay  which is enclosed by the Federal Breakwater  commonly ranks among the poorest on the West Coast  Many Long Beach beaches average a D or F grade on beach water quality in the Beach Report Card published by Heal the Bay  12  The Los Angeles River discharges directly into the Long Beach side of San Pedro Bay  and conveys a large portion of all the urban runoff from the entire Los Angeles metropolitan area directly into the harbor water  This runoff contains most of the debris  garbage  chemical pollutants  and biological pathogens that are washed into storm drains in every upstream city each time it rains  Because the breakwater prevents normal tidal flushing and wave action  these pollutants build up in the harbor  The water enclosed by the breakwater  along most of the City s beaches  can be subject to red tides due to this stagnation as well  Because of these factors  the water in Long Beach often is unsafe for swimming  12   edit  Ecology View of Long Beach The area that is now Long Beach historically included several ecological communities  with coastal scrub dominating  13  A handful of the native plants of the region can still be found in the city  These include California buckwheat  Eriogonum fasciculatum   California sagebrush  Artemisia californica   and California poppy  Eschscholzia californica   Some stands of coast live oak  Quercus agrifolia  still remain in the El Dorado Nature Center  California fan palm  Washingtonia filifera   a plant that is native further inland  was introduced to the city as a garden ornamental and is now naturalized  Some indigenous species of birds  mammals  and other wildlife have adapted to development  Since the arrival of Europeans  many alien species have become naturalized in the area  Introduced plants include yellow mustard  eucalyptus  wild radish  and tumbleweed  Such plants now far outnumber the indigenous plants and spread rapidly in the city s vacant lots and oil fields  The city and its residents have initiatives underway to preserve and reclaim a small part of its ecological heritage  The RiverLink project has begun to revegetate the Long Beach stretch of the Los Angeles River with indigenous plants  Part of the remaining Pacific Electric right of way was cleared of nonnatives  planted with indigenous plants  and made accessible with foot and bike paths  This community open space is now known as The Long Beach Greenbelt and is the focus of continuing efforts in restoration and community education  The El Dorado Nature Center has changed its original  hands off  approach and begun to actively introduce indigenous species  14  The Los Cerritos Wetlands Study Group  state government agencies  and grassroots groups are collaborating on a plan to preserve Long Beach s last remaining wetlands  15  Long Beach is the first city in California to join the  EcoZone  Program  intended to measurably improve environmental conditions through public private partnerships  Such projects seek to reduce pollution  restore native habitat  and provide green areas for the city s residents to enjoy  Other places in Long Beach to see natural areas include Bluff Park  coastal bluffs   the Golden Shores Marine Reserve  the Jack Dunster Marine Reserve  Shoreline Park  and DeForest Park   edit  Demographics Historical populations Census Pop     1890 564   1900 2 252 299 3  1910 17 809 690 8  1920 55 593 212 2

 when its population was predominantly European American and the city was nicknamed  Iowa by the Sea  or  Iowa under Palm Trees  as it had a slower pace than that of neighboring Los Angeles  In 1950  whites represented 97 4  of Long Beach s population  18  Since the second half of the 20th century  the city has been a major port of entry for Asian and Latin American immigrants headed to Los Angeles  The Harbor section of downtown Long Beach was once home to people of Dutch  Greek  Italian  Maltese  Portuguese and Spanish ancestry  most of them employed in manufacturing and fish canneries until the 1960s  According to a report by USA Today in 2000  Long Beach is the most ethnically diverse large city in the United States  19  Non Hispanic White Americans made up 30 0  of the city s population  Its Asian community includes the largest Cambodian community in the United States  and the second largest Cambodian community outside of Asia  after Paris   A neighborhood along Anaheim Street is called  Little Phnom Penh   There are also sizable populations of immigrants and descendants from Vietnam and the Philippines  Long Beach had offered many industrial jobs to African Americans during the years of World War II  This resulted in the increase of blacks in Long Beach caused by the Second Great Migration  There are black communities in the Eastside and North Long Beach neighborhoods  It has a relatively high proportion of Pacific Islanders  over 1  as of the 2000 Census   from Samoa and Tonga  Most American Indians  about 0 8  of the city s population  arrived during the Department of Interior s Bureau of Indian Affairs urban relocation programs in the 1950s  Long Beach once had a sizable Japanese American population  which largely worked in the fish canneries on Terminal Island and on small truck farms in the area  In 1942  not long after the Attack on Pearl Harbor and subsequent Japanese declaration of war on the United States and Britain  President Franklin D  Roosevelt issued United States Executive Order 9066 which allowed military commanders to designate areas  from which any or all persons may be excluded   Under this order  all Japanese and Americans of Japanese ancestry were categorically removed from Western coastal regions and sent to internment camps  without regard for due process  Most did not return to Long Beach after their release from the camps  Japanese Americans make up less than 1  of the population of Long Beach  yet the city still has a Japanese Community Center and a Japanese Buddhist Church from its
