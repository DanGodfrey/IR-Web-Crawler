volcanic origin in the South Atlantic Ocean  It is part of the British overseas territory of Saint Helena  Ascension and Tristan da Cunha 3  which also includes Ascension Island and the islands of Tristan da Cunha  Saint Helena measures about 16 by 8 kilometres  10 by 5 mi  and has a population of 4 255  2008 census   2  The island was uninhabited when discovered by the Portuguese in 1502  It is one of the most isolated islands in the world  For centuries  it was an important stopover for ships sailing to Europe from Asia and South Africa  The British also used the island as a place of exile  most notably for Napoleon I  Dinuzulu kaCetshwayo and more than 5 000 Boer prisoners  Saint Helena is now Britain s second oldest remaining colony  now termed overseas territory   after Bermuda

accounts state that the island was discovered on 21 May 1502 by the Galician navigator Jo o da Nova sailing at the service of the Portuguese Crown  and that he named it  Santa Helena  after Helena of Constantinople  Another theory holds that the island found by De Nova was actually Tristan da Cunha 2 430 kilometres  1 510 mi  to its south  4  and that Saint Helena was discovered by some of the ships attached to the squadron of Est v o da Gama expedition on 30 July 1503  as reported in the account of clerk Thom  Lopes   5  6  7  The Portuguese found the island uninhabited  with an abundance of trees and fresh water  They imported livestock  fruit trees and vegetables  and built a chapel and one or two houses  Though they formed no permanent settlement  the island was an important rendezvous point and source of food for ships travelling from Asia to Europe  Englishman Sir Francis Drake probably located the island on the final lap of his circumnavigation of the world  1577 1580   8  Further visits by other English explorers followed  and  once Saint Helena s location was more widely known  English ships of war began to lie in wait in the area to attack Portuguese India carracks on their way home  In developing their Far East trade  the Dutch also began to frequent the island  The Portuguese and Spanish soon gave up regularly calling at the island  partly because they used ports along the West African coast  but also because of attacks on their shipping  the desecration of their chapel and religious icons  destruction of their livestock and destruction of plantations by Dutch and English sailors  The Dutch Republic formally made claim to Saint Helena in 1633  although there is no evidence that they ever occupied  colonised or fortified it  By 1651  the Dutch had mainly abandoned the island in favour of their colony at the Cape of Good Hope   edit  East India Company  1658 1815  A View of the Town and Island of St Helena in the Atlantic Ocean belonging to the English East India Company   engraving c  1790 In 1657  Oliver Cromwell 9  granted the English East India Company a charter to govern Saint Helena and the following year the Company decided to fortify the island and colonise it with planters  The first governor  Captain John Dutton  arrived in 1659  and from that date Saint Helena was Britain s second oldest colony  after Bermuda   A fort and houses were built  After the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660  the East India Company received a Royal Charter giving it the sole right to fortify and colonise the island  The fort was renamed James Fort and the town Jamestown  in honour of the Duke of York  later James II of England  Between January and May 1673 the Dutch East India Company forcibly took the island  before English reinforcements restored English East India Company control  The Company experienced difficulty attracting new immigrants  and unrest and rebellion fomented among the inhabitants  Ecological problems  including deforestation  soil erosion  vermin and drought  led Governor Isaac Pyke to suggest in 1715 that the population be moved to Mauritius  but this was not acted upon and the Company continued to subsidise the community because of the island s strategic location  A census in 1723 recorded 1 110 people  including 610 slaves  Eighteenth century governors tried to tackle the island s problems by extending tree plantations  improving fortifications  eliminating corruption  building a hospital  tackling the neglect of crops and livestock  controlling the consumption of alcohol and introducing legal reforms  From about 1770  the island enjoyed a lengthy period of prosperity  Captain James Cook visited the island in 1775 on the final leg of his second circumnavigation of the world  Saint James  Church was erected in Jamestown in 1774 and in 1791 2 Plantation House was built  and has since been the official residence of the Governor  On leaving the University of Oxford  in 1676  Edmond Halley visited Saint Helena and set up an observatory with a 24 foot long  7 3 m  aerial telescope with the intention of studying stars from the Southern Hemisphere  10  The site of this telescope is near Saint Mathew s Church in Hutt s Gate  in the Longwood district  The 680 m high hill there is named for him and is called Halley s Mount  The importation of slaves was made illegal in 1792  Governor Robert Patton  1802 1807  recommended that the Company import Chinese labour to supplement the rural workforce  The labourers arrived in 1810  and their numbers reached 600 by 1818  Many were allowed to stay  and their descendents became integrated into the population  An 1814 census recorded 3 507 people on the island   edit  British rule 1815 1821  and Napoleon s exile Napoleon at Saint Helena  Longwood House  Saint Helena  site of Napoleon s captivity  See also  Napoleon I of France  Exile on Saint Helena In 1815 the British government selected Saint Helena as the place of detention of Napoleon Bonaparte  He was brought to the island in October 1815 and lodged at Longwood  where he died on 5 May 1821  During this period  Saint Helena remained in the East India Company s possession  but the British government met additional costs arising from guarding Napoleon  The island was strongly garrisoned with British troops  and naval ships circled the island  The 1817 census recorded 821 white inhabitants  a garrison of 820 men  618 Chinese indentured labourers  500 free blacks and 1 540 slaves  In 1818  Governor Hudson Lowe initiated the emancipation of the slaves   edit  British East India Company  1821 1834 After Napoleon s death the thousands of temporary visitors were soon withdrawn and the East India Company resumed full control of Saint Helena  Owing to Napoleon s praise of Saint Helena s coffee during his exile on the island  the product enjoyed a brief popularity in Paris in the years after his death  The importation of slaves was banned in 1792  but the phased emancipation of over 800 resident slaves did not take place until 1827  some six years before legislation to ban slavery in the colonies was passed by the British Parliament  11   edit  British rule  a Crown colony  1834 1981 Under the provisions of the 1833 India Act  control of Saint Helena was passed from the East India Company to the British Crown  becoming a crown colony  1  Subsequent administrative cost cutting triggered the start of a long term population decline whereby those who could afford to do so tended to leave the island for better opportunities elsewhere  The latter half of the 19th century saw the advent of steam ships not reliant on trade winds  as well as the diversion of Far East trade away from the traditional South Atlantic shipping lanes to a route via the Red Sea  which  prior to the building of the Suez Canal  involved a short overland section   These factors contributed to a decline in the number of ships calling at the island from 1 100 in 1855 to only 288 in 1889  In 1840  a British naval station established to suppress the African slave trade was based on the island  and between 1840 and 1849 over 15 000 freed slaves  known as  Liberated Africans   were landed there  In 1900 and 1901  over 6 000 Boer prisoners were held on the island  and the population reached its all time high of 9 850 in 1901  In 1858  the French emperor Napoleon III successfully gained the possession  in the name of the French government  of Longwood House and the lands around it  last residence of Napoleon I  who died there in 1821   It is still French property  administered by a French representative and under the authority of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs  A local industry manufacturing fibre from New Zealand flax was successfully reestablished in 1907 and generated considerable income during the First World War  Ascension Island was made a dependency of Saint Helena in 1922  and Tristan da Cunha followed in 1938  During World War II  the United States built Wideawake airport on Ascension in 1942  but no military use was made of Saint Helena  During this period  the island enjoyed increased revenues through the sale of flax  with prices peaking in 1951  However  the industry declined because of transportation costs and competition from synthetic fibres  The decision by the British Post Office to use synthetic fibres for its mailbags was a further blow  contributing to the closure of the island s flax mills in 1965  From 1958  the Union Castle shipping line gradually reduced its service calls to the island  Curnow Shipping  based in Avonmouth  replaced the Union Castle Line mailship service in 1977  using the RMS  Royal Mail Ship  St Helena   edit  1981 to present Saint Helena seen from space  photo is oriented south east towards the top  The British Nationality Act 1981 reclassified Saint Helena and the other Crown colonies as British Dependent Territories  The islanders lost their status as  Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies  and thus lost the right of abode in Britain  For the next 20 years  many could find only low paid work with the island government  and the only available overseas employment was on the Falkland Islands and Ascension Island  The Development and Economic Planning Department  which still operates  was formed in 1988 to contribute to raising the living standards of the people of Saint Helena  In 1989  Prince Andrew launched the replacement RMS St Helena to serve the island  the vessel was specially built for the Cardiff Cape Town route and features a mixed cargo passenger layout  The Saint Helena Constitution took effect in 1989 and provided that the island would be governed by a Governor and Commander in Chief  and an elected Executive and Legislative Council  In 2002  the British Overseas Territories Act restored full passports to the islanders  and renamed the Dependent Territories  including Saint Helena  the British Overseas Territories  In 2009  Saint Helena and its two territories received equal status under a new constitution  and the British Overseas Territory was renamed Saint Helena  Ascension and Tristan da Cunha  In 2011  the UK government announced it would invest  200m in an airport on the island  which would benefit the British government in the long term  as  26m a year in aid would no longer be required  It is expected the airport will be up and running by 2015  The aims of the airport are to reduce prices of transportation of goods  increase tourism by more than 50 fold and to create new job opportunities  Flying to the island will only be available from South Africa  according to the 2011 plans   edit  Geography  flora and fauna Main articles  Geography of Saint Helena  Wildlife of Saint Helena  Ascension and

places in the world  located in the South Atlantic Ocean more than 2 000 kilometres  1 200 mi  from the nearest major landmass  The nearest port on the continent is Namibe in Southern Angola  the nearest international airport the Quatro de Fevereiro Airport of Angola s capital Luanda  The island is associated with two other isolated islands in southern Atlantic  also British territories   Ascension Island about 1 300 kilometres  810 mi  to the due northwest in more equatorial waters and Tristan da Cunha  which is well outside the tropics 2 430 kilometres  1 510 mi  to the south  12  The island is situated in the Western Hemisphere and has the same longitude as Cornwall in the United Kingdom  The island of Saint Helena has a total area of 122 km2  47 sq mi   and is composed largely of rugged terrain of volcanic origin  the last volcanic eruptions occurred roughly 7 million years ago   13  The centre is covered by forest  of which some has been planted  including the Millennium Forest project  The highland areas contain most of the island s endemic flora  fauna  insects and birds  The coastal areas are barren  covered in volcanic rock and are warmer and drier than the centre of the island  There are no native land mammals on Saint Helena  but rabbits  rats and mice have been introduced  as well as feral cats and dogs  The highest point of the island is Diana s Peak at 818 m  2 684 ft   In 1996 it became the island s first national park  In 2000 a project began to replant part of the lost Great Wood  called the Millennium Forest  and is now managed by the Saint Helena National Trust  established in 2002  When the island was discovered  it was covered with unique indigenous vegetation  including a remarkable cabbage tree species  The flora of Saint Helena contains a high proportion of endemic species  The island s hinterland must have been a dense tropical forest but the coastal areas were probably quite green as well  The modern landscape is very different  with widespread bare rock in the lower areas  although inland it is green  mainly due to introduced vegetation  The dramatic change in landscape must be attributed to the introduction of goats and the introduction of new vegetation  As a result  the string tree  Acalypha rubrinervis  and the St Helena olive  Nesiota elliptica  are now extinct  and many of the other endemic plants are threatened with extinction  There are several rocks and islets off the coast  including  Castle Rock  Speery Island  the Needle  Lower Black Rock  Upper Black Rock  South   Bird Island  Southwest

Politics of Saint Helena Executive authority in Saint Helena is invested in Queen Elizabeth II and is exercised on her behalf by the Governor of Saint Helena  The Governor is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the British government  Defence and Foreign Affairs remain the responsibility of the United Kingdom  There are fifteen seats in the Legislative Council of Saint Helena  a unicameral legislature  Twelve of the fifteen members are elected in elections held every four years  The other three members are the Governor and two ex officio officers  The Executive Council consists of the Governor  two ex officio officers  and six elected members of the Legislative Council appointed by the Governor  There is no elected Chief Minister  and the Governor acts as the head of government  Both Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha have an Administrator appointed to represent the Governor of Saint Helena  One commentator has observed that  notwithstanding the high unemployment resulting from the loss of full passports during 1981 2002  the level of loyalty to the British monarchy by the St Helena population is probably not exceeded in any other part of the world  20  King George VI is the only reigning monarch to have visited the island  This was in 1947 when the King  accompanied by Queen Elizabeth  later the Queen Mother   Princess Elizabeth  later Queen Elizabeth II  and Princess Margaret were travelling to South Africa  Prince Philip arrived at St Helena in 1957 and then his son Prince Andrew visited as a member of the armed forces in 1984 and his sister the Princess

of about 4 250 inhabitants  mainly descended from people from Britain   settlers   planters   and soldiers   and slaves who were brought there from the beginning of settlement   initially from Africa  the Cape Verde Islands  Gold Coast and west coast of Africa are mentioned in early records   then India and Madagascar  Eventually the planters felt there were too many slaves and no more were imported after 1792  In 1840  St Helena became a provisioning station for the British West Africa Squadron  15  preventing slavery to Brazil  mainly   and many thousands of slaves were freed on the island  These were all African  and about 500 stayed while the rest were sent on to the West Indies and Cape Town  and eventually to Sierra Leone  Imported Chinese labourers arrived in 1810  reaching a peak of 618 in 1818  after which numbers were reduced  Only a few older men remained after the British Crown took over the government of the island from the East India Company in 1834  The majority were sent back to China  although records in the Cape suggest that they never got any further than Cape Town  There were also a very few Indian lascars who worked under the harbour master  Jamestown  the capital of Saint Helena The citizens of Saint Helena hold British Overseas Territories citizenship  On 21 May 2002  full British citizenship was restored by the British Overseas Territories Act 2002  21  See also British nationality law  During periods of unemployment  there has been a long pattern of emigration from the island since the post Napoleonic period  The majority of  Saints  emigrated to the UK  South Africa  and in the early years  Australia  The population has steadily declined since the late 1980s and has dropped from 5 157 at the 1998 census to 4 255 in 2008  In the past emigration was characterised by young unaccompanied persons leaving to work on long term contracts on Ascension and the Falkland Islands  but since  Saints  were re awarded UK citizenship in 2002  emigration to the UK by a wider range of wage earners has accelerated due to the prospect of higher wages and better progression prospects  Saint Helena is one of the few territories in the world which has never had a recorded HIV   AIDS case  22   edit  Religion See also  Category Religion in Saint Helena The majority of people belong to the Anglican Communion  being members of the Diocese of St Helena  which includes Ascension Island  and which has its own Bishop residing on St Helena  The 150th Anniversary of the Diocese was celebrated in June 2009  Other Christian denominations on the island include  Roman Catholic  since 1852   Salvation Army  since 1884   Baptist  since 1845   and  in more recent times  Seventh day Adventist  since 1949   New Apostolic  and Jehovah s Witness  one out of every 35 residents is a Jehovah s Witness  the highest ratio in the world   23  The Baha i Faith has also been represented on the island since 1954   edit  Tristan da Cunha and Ascension Tristan da Cunha  settled since 1815  has a population of fewer than three hundred inhabitants of mainly British  Irish  Italian and St Helenian descent  Christianity is the main religion  mainly Anglican and some Roman Catholic  Ascension Island has no native inhabitants  It is a working island with a transient population of approximately 1 000  made up mainly of members of the American and British militaries  supporting civilian contractors who serve on the joint Anglo American airbase  and members of their families  a few of whom were born on the island   There are also some Cable  amp  Wireless and local government employees   edit  Economy This section contains unclear time references  statements of unknown date written in the present tense  Main article  Economy of Saint Helena Some of the data in this section has been sourced from the Government of St Helena Sustainable Development Plan  24  The island had a monocrop economy until 1966  based on the cultivation and processing of New Zealand flax for rope and string  St Helena s economy is now very weak  and the island is almost entirely sustained by aid from the British government  The public sector dominates the economy  accounting for about half of gross domestic product  GDP   Inflation was running at 3 6  in 2005  There have been recent increases in the cost of fuel  power and all imported goods  The Saint Helena tourist industry is heavily based on the promotion of Napoleon s imprisonment  A golf course also exists and the possibility for sportfishing tourism is great  Three hotels operate on the island but since the arrival of tourists is directly linked to the arrival and departure schedule of the RMS  Royal Mail Ship   occupancy levels are very low at about 10   Some 1 180 short  and long term visitors arrived on the island in 2005  Saint Helena produces what is said to be the most expensive coffee in the world  It also produces and exports Tungi Spirit  made from the fruit of the prickly or cactus pears  Opuntia ficus indica   Tungi  is the local St Helenian name for the plant   Ascension Island  Tristan da Cunha and Saint Helena all issue their own postage stamps which provide a significant income   edit  Economic statistics Quoted at constant 2002 prices  GDP fell from  12 4 million in 1999 2000 to  11 2 million in 2005 6  Imports are mainly from the UK and South Africa and amounted to  6 4 million in 2004 5  quoted on an FOB basis   Exports are much smaller  amounting to  0 24 million in 2004 5  Exports mainly comprise fish and coffee  Philatelic sales were  0 06 million that year  The limited number of visiting tourists spent about  0 43 million in 2004 05  representing a contribution to GDP of 3 1   Public expenditure rose from  10 2 million in 2001 02 to  12 3 million in 2005 06  The contribution of UK budgetary aid to total SHG government expenditure rose from  4 6 million in to  6 4 million over the same period  Wages and salaries represent about 38  of recurrent expenditure  Unemployment levels are low  50 in 2004 compared with 342 in 1998   The economy is dominated by the public sector  the number of government positions only falling slightly from 1 163 in 2002 to 1 142 in 2006  Public sector employment is characterised by high turnover rates  mainly due to emigration  St Helena s private sector employs approximately 45 per cent of the employed labour force and is largely dominated by small and micro businesses with 218 private businesses employing 886 in 2004  Household survey results suggest that the percentage of households who spend less than  20 per week on a per capita basis fell from 27  to 8  between 2000 and 2004  implying a decline in income poverty  Nevertheless  22  of the population claimed social security benefit in 2006 7  although most of these are aged over 60   this sector represents 20  of the population   edit  Banking and currency In 1821  Saul Solomon issued a token copper currency of 70 560 halfpennies Payable at St Helena by Solomon  Dickson and Taylor   presumably London partners   which circulated alongside the East India Company s local coinage until the Crown took over the Island in 1836  The coin remains readily available to collectors  Today Saint Helena has its own currency  the Saint Helena pound which is at parity with the pound sterling  The government of Saint Helena produces its own coinage and banknotes  The Bank of Saint Helena was established on Saint Helena and Ascension Island in the year 2004  It has branches in Jamestown on Saint Helena  and Georgetown  Ascension Island and it took over the business of the St  Helena government savings bank and the Ascension Island Savings Bank  25  For more information on currency in the wider region

Helena was due for decommissioning in 2010  However  its service life has been extended indefinitely until the airstrip is completed  citation needed  After a long period of rumour and consultation  the British government announced plans to construct an airport in Saint Helena in March 2005 and the airport was originally expected to be completed by 2010  However constant delays by the British government citation needed  meant an approved bidder  the Italian firm Impregilo  was not chosen until 2008  and then the project was put on hold in November 2008  allegedly due to new financial pressures brought on by the credit crunch  By January 2009  construction had not commenced and no final contracts had been signed  and Governor Andrew Gurr departed for London in an attempt to speed up the process and solve the problems  On 22 July 2010  the British government agreed to help pay for the new airstrip using taxpayer money  27  In November 2011 a new deal between the British government and South African company Basil Read was signed and now means the airport is proposed to open in 2015  with flights to and from South Africa  28  A minibus offers a basic service to carry

Ascension island and the United Kingdom  37  Since all international telephone and internet communications are relying on this single satellite link both internet and telephone service are subject to sun outages  Although the South Atlantic Express submarine communications cable will pass St Helena relatively closely there are no plans to land the cable and install a relay station ashore  which could supply the population with sufficient bandwidth  As of January 2012  there is a group of supporters petitioning the UK government to meet the cost of landing the cable at St Helena  38  Saint Helena has the international calling code  290 which  since 2006  Tristan da Cunha shares  Telephone numbers are 4 digits long  Numbers start with 1 9  with 8xxx being reserved for Tristan da Cunha

publicly subsidised Media Services  which publishes the St Helena Herald and broadcasts on Radio St Helena  would no longer be allowed to run advertisements  44  Simultaneously  the St Helena Independent and Saint FM announced that they would need to increase advertising rates  which barely covered the cost of producing adverts   edit  Culture and society See also  Public holidays in Saint
