highest level of professional American football in the United States  and is considered the top professional American football league in the world  1  It was formed by eleven teams in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association  with the league changing its name to the National Football League in 1922  The league currently consists of thirty two teams from the United States  The league is divided evenly into two conferences   the American Football Conference  AFC  and National Football Conference  NFC   and each conference has four divisions that have four teams each  for a total of 16 teams in each conference  The NFL is an unincorporated 501 c  6  association  2  3  4  a federal nonprofit designation  5  comprising its 32 teams  6  7  The regular season is a seventeen week schedule during which each team plays sixteen games and has one bye week  The season currently starts on the Thursday night in the first full week of September and runs weekly to late December or early January  At the end of each regular season  six teams from each conference  at least one from each division  play in the NFL playoffs  a twelve team single elimination tournament that culminates with the championship game  known as the Super Bowl  This game is held at a pre selected site which is usually a city that hosts an NFL team  The NFL is the most attended domestic sports league in the world by average attendance per game  with 66 960 fans per game in 2010 11  8  Although not as frequently as the other major professional sports leagues in the United States  the NFL still is not immune to labor disputes  such as the players  strikes of 1982 and 1987  and more recently a lockout in 2011  though the latest did not result in the cancellation of any regular season games  Contents

article  History of the National Football League In 1920 representatives of several professional American football leagues and independent teams founded the American Professional Football Conference  soon renamed the National Football League  The first official championship game was held in 1933  before then  there was no playoff system  and instead the team that finished with the best regular season record was awarded the league title  By 1958  when that season s NFL championship game became known as  The Greatest Game Ever Played   the NFL was on its way to becoming one of the most popular sports leagues in the United States  In 1965  football supplanted baseball as the most popular televised sport in America  9  The merger with the American Football League  agreed to in 1966 and completed in 1970  greatly expanded the league and created the Super Bowl  which has become one of the most watched sporting events in the world  and is second to association football  soccer  s UEFA Champions League final as the most watched annual sporting event worldwide  10   edit  Official rules and notable rule distinctions See also  American football rules and List of NFL nicknames Rules named after NFL figures Although rules for NFL  college  and high school American football games are generally consistent  there are several differences  In addition  the NFL frequently makes rule changes because of exploits on the field by a single coach  owner  player  or referee  Some of the major rules differences include  A pass is ruled complete if both of the receiver s feet are inbounds at the time of the catch  In college and high school football  only one foot is required to be inbounds  In the NFL  a player is considered down when he is tackled or forced down by a member of the opposing team  also known as  down by contact    In college football  a player is automatically ruled down when any part of his body other than the feet or hands touches the ground or when the ball carrier is tackled or otherwise falls and loses possession of the ball as he contacts the ground with any part of his body  NFL players in certain positions are normally ineligible to catch passes  As an aid for game officials to enforce this rule  players wear uniform numbers based on the position they play   see below  Unlike college and high school  the NFL has a two minute warning  an automatic time out that occurs when two minutes of game time remain on the game clock in each half of a game  Also unique to the NFL  the game clock never stops after the offense completes a first down in order to reset the first down chains  Two point conversion tries are attempted from the two yard line  whereas in college football they are attempted from the three yard line  In college football  the defensive team may score two points on a point after touchdown attempt by returning a blocked kick  fumble  or interception into the opposition s end zone  The NFL does not allow this  and instead a conversion attempt is automatically ruled as  no good  when the defending team gains possession of the football  There are several differences in enforcing penalties  For example  defensive pass interference results in the ball being placed at the spot of the foul  In college football  the same penalty is capped at maximum of 15 yards  In the NFL  overtime is decided by a 15 minute sudden death quarter during regular season games and can still end in a tie if neither team scores  During college football s overtime  each team is given one possession from its opponent s twenty five yard line with no game clock  The team leading after both possessions is declared the winner  If the two college teams remain tied  additional overtime periods are played  For instant replay  NFL teams are given two replay challenges per game  and can be awarded a third one if the other two are successful  Replays of scoring plays  the final 2 00 of each half and all overtime periods are instead initiated by the official in the replay booth  In college football  teams are only originally allocated one replay challenge  and can get a second one if successful   and the replay official can initiate reviews of all plays   edit  Season structure Since 2002  the NFL season features the following schedule  a 4 game exhibition season  or preseason  running from early August to early September  a 16 game  17 week regular season running from September to December or early January  and a 12 team single elimination playoff beginning in January  culminating in the Super Bowl in early February  Traditionally  American high school football games are played on Friday nights  American college football games are played on Thursday nights and Saturdays  and most NFL games are played on Sunday  Because the NFL season is longer than the college football season  the NFL schedules Saturday games and Saturday playoff games outside the college football season  The ABC Television network added Monday Night Football in 1970  and Thursday night NFL games were added in the 1980s   edit  Exhibition season Main article  National Football League preseason Following mini camps in the spring and officially recognized training camp in July August  NFL teams typically play four exhibition games from early August through early September  Each team hosts two games of the four  The exhibition season begins with the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game  so those two teams play five exhibition games each  Historically  the American Bowl s  were played prior to the NFL scheduling regular season games abroad and those teams faced this similar predicament  The games are useful for new players who are not used to playing in front of very large crowds  Management often uses the games to evaluate newly signed players  Veteran starters will generally play only for about a quarter of each game to minimize the risk of injury  Several lawsuits have been brought by fans  against the policy of including exhibition games in season ticket packages at regular season prices  but none have so far been very successful   edit  Regular season This chart displays an application of the NFL scheduling formula  At the end of the 2008 season  the Browns  in green  finished in fourth place in the AFC North  Thus the Browns in 2009 had to play all the other AFC North teams  in blue  twice  all the AFC West teams  another division within its own conference  once  all the NFC North teams  a division in the other conference  once  and the Bills and the Jaguars  who also finished in fourth place in their respective AFC divisions during that previous season  Main article  National Football League regular season Following the preseason  each of the thirty two teams embark on a seventeen week  sixteen game schedule  with the extra week consisting of a bye to allow teams a rest sometime in the middle of the season  and also to increase television coverage   The regular season currently begins the Thursday evening after Labor Day with a primetime  Kickoff Game   NBC currently holds broadcast rights for that game   According to the current scheduling structure  the earliest the season could begin is September 4  as it was in the 2008 season   while the latest would be September 10  as it was in the 2009 season  due to September 1 falling on a Tuesday   The regular season ends no later than January 3  in any given year  The league uses a scheduling formula to pre determine which teams plays whom during a given season  Under the current formula since 2002  each of the thirty two teams  respective 16 game schedule consists for the following  11  12  Each team plays the other three teams in their division twice  once at home  and once on the road  six games   Each team plays the four teams from another division within its own conference once on a rotating three year cycle  two at home  and two on the road  four games   Each team plays the four teams from a division in the other conference once on a rotating four year cycle  two at home  and two on the road  four games   Each team plays once against the other teams in its conference that finished in the same place in their own divisions as themselves the previous season  not counting the division they were already scheduled to play  one at home  one on the road  two games   Although this scheduling formula determines each of the thirty two teams  respective opponents  the league usually does not release the final regular schedule with specific dates and times until the spring  the NFL needs several months to coordinate the entire season schedule so that  among other reasons  games are worked around various scheduling conflicts  and that it helps maximize TV ratings  13   edit  Playoffs The NFL Playoffs  Each of the four division winners is seeded 1 4 based on their W L T records  The two Wild Card teams  labeled Wild Card 1 and 2  are seeded fifth and sixth  with the better of the two having seed 5  regardless of their records compared to the four division winners  Main article  National Football League playoffs The season concludes with a twelve team tournament used to determine the teams to play in the Super Bowl  The tournament brackets are made up of six teams from each of the league s two conferences  the American Football Conference  AFC  and the National Football Conference  NFC   following the end of the 16 game regular season  The four division champions from each conference  the team in each division with the best regular season won lost tied record   which are seeded one through four based on their regular season won lost tied record  tie breaker rules may apply   Two wild card qualifiers from each conference  those non division champions with the conference s best record  i e  the best won lost tied percentages  with a series of tie breaking rules in place in the event that there are teams with the same number of wins and losses 14    which are seeded five and six  In each conference  the No  3 and No  6 seeded teams  and the No  4 and No  5 seeds  face each other during the first round of the playoffs  dubbed the Wild Card Playoffs  the league in recent years has also used the term Wild Card Weekend   The No  1 and No  2 seeds from each conference receive a bye in the first round  which entitles these teams to automatically advance to the second round  the Divisional Playoff games  to face the winning teams from the first round  In round two  the No  1 seeded team always plays the lowest surviving seed in their conference  And in any given playoff game  whoever has the higher seed gets the home field advantage  i e  the game is held at the higher seed s home field   The two surviving teams from the Divisional Playoff games meet in Conference Championship games  with the winners of those contests going on to face one another in the Super Bowl in a game located at a neutral venue that is usually either indoors or in a warm weather locale  The designated  home team  alternates year to year between the conferences  In odd numbered Super Bowls  the NFC team is the designated  home team   with the AFC team serving as the home team for even numbered games  The NFL is the only one out of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States to use a single elimination tournament in its playoffs  Major League Baseball  the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League all use a  best of  format instead   edit  Pro Bowl The Pro Bowl  the league s all star game  has been traditionally held on the weekend before the Super Bowl  The game was played at various venues before being held at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu  Hawaii for 30 consecutive seasons from 1980 to 2009  However  the 2010 Pro Bowl was played at Sun Life Stadium  the home stadium of the Miami Dolphins and host site of Super Bowl XLIV  on January 31  the first time ever that the Pro Bowl was played before the championship game  The game returned to Honolulu in 2011 and 2012  though both games were still played before the Super Bowl   edit  Calendar Though the NFL only plays in the late summer  fall  and early winter  the extended offseason often is an event in itself  with the draft  free agency signings  and the announcement of schedules keeping the NFL in the spotlight even during

thirty two clubs  Each club is allowed a maximum of fifty three players on their roster  but may only dress forty five to play each week during the regular season  Reflecting the population distribution of the United States as a whole  most teams are in the eastern half of the country  seventeen teams are in the Eastern Time Zone and nine others in the Central Time Zone  Most major metropolitan areas in the United States have an NFL franchise  although Los Angeles  the second largest metropolitan area in the country  has not hosted an NFL team since 1994  Further information  History of the National Football League in Los Angeles The Rams and the Raiders called the Los Angeles area home from 1946 1994 and 1982 1994 respectively  On August 9  2011  the LA City Council approved plans to build Farmers Field which could be home to an NFL team  It is unknown which team  if any  will move to the venue  15  Unlike Major League Baseball  Major League Soccer  the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League  the league has two full time teams in Canada  Toronto Moose   amp  Montreal Destroyers    although the Buffalo Bills play one game per year in Toronto  There has been discussion of possibly bringing the NFL to Toronto  the largest city in Canada  In addition  as of 2012  the St  Louis Rams will begin hosting one of its regular season games in London  England as part of the International Series  making the NFL the first U S  based sports league to have one of its teams establish a home stadium outside North America  The Dallas Cowboys are the highest valued American football franchise  valued at approximately  1 6 billion 16  and one of the most valuable franchises in all of professional sports worldwide  currently second 17  behind English soccer club Manchester United  16  which has an approximate value of  1 8 billion at current exchange rates  18  Since the 2002 season  the teams have been aligned as follows  Division

As the result of a relocation controversy in 1996  the league officially suspended operations of the Cleveland Browns while its players and personnel moved to Baltimore to become a new franchise

information  Defunct National Football League franchises In its earliest years  the NFL was a very unstable and somewhat informal organization  Many teams entered and left the league annually  However  since the acquisition of the All America Football Conference in 1950  the NFL has shown remarkable stability  The last NFL team to fold was the Dallas Texans in 1952  its remnants were salvaged to form the expansion Baltimore Colts   edit  Media See also  List of current NFL broadcasters  edit  Television For more details on this topic  see NFL on television  Annually  the Super Bowl often

Among its duties is negotiating collective bargaining agreements  CBA  with league owners  which governs the negotiation of individual player contracts for all of the league s players  The NFLPA was established in 1956  and has renounced collective bargaining rights at least twice in its history during labor disputes  the 1987 strike and the 2011 lockout  One CBA was in place since 1993  and was amended in 1998 and again in 2006  But in 2008  the owners exercised their right to opt out of the agreement two years early  33  34  This led to a lockout in 2011  the NFL s first work stoppage since 1987  which is longer than Major League Baseball  1994 and beginning of 1995 seasons   the NBA  1998 99 season  or the NHL  2004 05 season canceled   Among the items covered in the CBA are  The league minimum salary The salary cap The annual collegiate draft Rules regarding  free agency  Waiver rules Under the 1993 CBA  players were tiered into three different levels with regards to their rights to negotiate for contracts  Players who have been drafted  see below   and have not yet played in their first year  may only negotiate with the team that drafted them  33  If terms cannot be agreed upon  the players  only recourse is to refuse to play   hold out   until terms can be reached  Players often use the threat of holding out as a means to force the hands of the teams that drafted them  For example  John Elway was drafted by the Baltimore Colts in 1983 but refused to play for them  He had a fallback option of baseball  as he had played in the New York Yankees organization for two summers while at Stanford  The Colts traded his rights to the Denver Broncos and Elway agreed to play  35 Bo Jackson sat out an entire year in 1986  choosing to play baseball in the Kansas City Royals organization rather than play for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers  the team that had drafted him  He reentered the draft the following year  and was drafted and subsequently signed with the Los Angeles Raiders  36  Players that have played three full seasons in the league  and whose contract has expired are considered  Restricted Free Agents   see below   They have limited rights to negotiate with any club  33  Players that have played four or more full seasons in the league  and whose contract has expired  are considered  Unrestricted Free Agents  see below  and have unlimited rights to negotiate with any club  Teams may name a single player in any given year as a  Franchise Player   see below   which eliminates much of that player s negotiation rights  This is a limited right of the team  however  and affects only a small handful of players each year  33  In the 2010 season  the CBA was not extended  thus changing the rules so that players don t become  Unrestricted Free Agents  until they have played at least six full seasons in the league  They will be  Restricted Free Agents  if they have three five full seasons in the league  Under the current  2011  CBA  there were several items altered  37  Free agency guidelines returned to the way they were from 1993 to 2009  This means that a player needs four years of experience to become an unrestricted free agent  and three years of experience for restricted free agency  The salary cap is now  120 375 million  with a salary minimum of  107 1 million  89 percent of the salary cap   For the 2011 season  teams have the option of using a  3 million exemption on a signed player  For the years following the 2011 season  teams have the option of designating three player exemptions at  1 5 million each  The rookie compensation was altered  There is a limit to the amount of money given to rookies  with the maximum total in 2011 being  874 million  First round picks receive four year deals  with a fifth year option  In the second through seventh rounds  there are slotted four year deals  The league minimum salary for players increased by 10 12 percent  based on tenure  A team s ability to place a franchise or transition tag on top players to retain his rights did not change  Other major concerns included health and safety of players  as well as former player benefits and pensions  The new 10 year collective bargaining agreement runs through 2021  and has an estimated value of  12  16 billion per year  38  39  For more information on the players  and owners  takeaways with the 2011 CBA  see the 2011 NFL lockout article   edit  Salaries A player s salary  as defined by the CBA  includes any  compensation in money  property  investments  loans or anything else of value to which an NFL player may be awarded  excluding such benefits as insurance and pension  A salary can include an annual pay and a one time  signing bonus  which is paid in full when the player signs his contract  For the purposes of the salary cap  see below   the signing bonus is prorated over the life of the contract rather than to the year in which the signing bonus is paid  40  Among other things  the CBA establishes a minimum salary for its players  40  which is stepped up as a player s years of experience increase  Players and their agents may negotiate with clubs for higher salaries  and frequently do  Under the new collective bargaining agreement  2011   Paragraph 5 guarantees first year after year of injury 50  of salary up to  1 million  30  of salary up to  500 000 in second year after year of injury  41   edit  Salary cap The salary cap is defined as the maximum amount that a team may spend on player compensation  see above  in a given season  for all of its players combined  Unlike other leagues  for example the NBA  which permits certain exemptions  or Major League Baseball  which has a  soft cap  enforced by  luxury taxes    the NFL has a  hard cap   an amount no team under any circumstances may exceed  The NFL also has a so called  hard floor   a minimum payroll that each team is required to pay regardless of the circumstances  The NFL salary cap is calculated by the current CBA to be 59 5  of the total projected league revenue for the upcoming year  This number  divided by the number of teams  determines an individual team s maximum salary cap  For 2008  this was approximately  116 million per team  42  For 2009  it increased to  127 million  43  As a result of the NFL owners opting out of the CBA two years early  the 2010 season had no salary cap or floor  34  Under the 2011 CBA  players get the following percentages of league revenue from three revenue streams  16  55  of TV revenues 45  from NFL Ventures and NFL Properties 40  of net local revenues at the club level Teams and players often find creative ways to fit salaries under the salary cap  Early in the salary cap era   signing bonuses  were used to give players a large chunk of money up front  and thus not count in the salary for the bulk of the contract  This led to a rule whereby all signing bonus are pro rated equally for each year of the contract  Thus if a player receives a  10 million signing bonus for a five year contract   2 million per year would count against the salary cap for the life of the contract  even though the full  10 million was paid up front during the first year of the contract  40  Player contracts tend to be  back loaded   This means that the contract is not divided equally among the time period it covers  Instead  the player earns progressively more and more each year  For instance  a player signing a four year deal worth  10 million may get paid  1 million the first year   2 million the second year   3 million the third year  and  4 million the fourth year  If a team cuts this player after the first year  the final three years do not count against the cap  Any signing bonus  however  ceases to be pro rated  and the entire balance of the bonus counts against the cap in the upcoming season  40   edit  NFL Draft For more details on this topic  see NFL Draft  Each April  each NFL franchise seeks to add new players to its roster through a collegiate draft known as  the NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting   which is more commonly known as the NFL Draft  Teams are ranked in inverse order based on the previous season s record  with the team having the worst record picking first  and the second worst picking second  and so on  Regardless of regular season records  the last two picks of each round go to the two teams in the Super Bowl immediately preceding the draft  with the Super Bowl champion picking last  The draft proceeds for seven rounds  In the past  Rounds 1 2 were run on Saturday of draft weekend  rounds 3 7 were run on Sunday  During 2010 the league experimented with a new system  Round 1 was run on Thursday night of the draft weekend  Rounds 2 and 3 were run on the Friday night of the draft weekend  Rounds 4 through 7 were run on Saturday  The impact of this change according to commentators at ESPN and Sports Illustrated was that teams gained more time to make trades for draft picks in the early rounds and that process enhanced the value of the first picks in Rounds 2 and 4  http   www nfl com draft 2010 and www si com Teams are given 10 minutes in the first round of the draft  7 in the second round and 5 in all other rounds  44  If the pick is not made in the allotted time  subsequent teams in the draft may draft before them  This happened in 2003 to the Minnesota Vikings  45  Teams have the option of trading away their picks to other teams for different picks  players  cash  or a combination thereof  While player for player trades are rare during the rest of the year  especially in comparison to the other major league sports   trades are far more common on draft day  In 1989  the Dallas Cowboys traded running back Herschel Walker to the Minnesota Vikings for five veteran players and six draft picks over 3 years  The Cowboys would use these picks to leverage trades for additional draft picks and veteran players  As a direct result of this trade  they would draft many of the stars who would help them win three Super Bowls in the 1990s  including Emmitt Smith  Russell Maryland  and Darren Woodson  46  The first pick in the draft is often taken to be the best overall player in the rookie class  This may or may not be true  since teams often select players based more on the teams  needs than on the players  overall skills  Plus  comparing players at different positions is difficult to do  Still  it is considered a great honor to be a first round pick  and a greater honor to be the first overall pick  The last pick in the draft is known as Mr  Irrelevant  and is the subject of a dinner in his  dubious  honor in Newport Beach  California  Drafted players may only negotiate with the team that drafted them  or to another team if their rights were traded away   The drafting team has one year to sign the player  If they do not do so  the player may reenter the draft and can be drafted by another team  Bo Jackson famously sat out a season in this way  36  Further information  List of NFL first overall draft choices  edit  Free agency For more details on this topic  see Free Agent National Football League usage   edit  General As defined by the Collective Bargaining Agreement  CBA   a free agent is any player who is not under contract to any team and thus has fully free rights to negotiate with any other team for new contract terms  33  47  Free agents are classified into two categories  restricted and unrestricted  Furthermore  a team may  tag  a player as a franchise or transition  which places additional restrictions on that player s ability to negotiate  However  the ability to  tag  is quite limited  and only affects a handful of players each year  Free agency in the NFL began with a limited free agency system known as  Plan B Free Agency   which was in effect between the 1989 and 1992 seasons  Beginning with the 1993 season   Plan A Free Agency  went into effect   edit  Restricted free agent For more details on this topic  see Restricted free agent  A player who has 3 years of experience is eligible for restricted free agency  whereby his current team has the chance to retain rights to this player by matching the highest offer any other NFL franchise might make to that player  The club can either block a signing or  in essence  force a trade by offering a salary over a certain threshold  In 2006  these thresholds were as follows  If a club tenders an offer of  685 000 per year for a three year veteran  and  725 000 for a four year veteran  the player s current team has  right of first refusal  over the contract at those terms  and may sign the player at those terms  If a club tenders an offer of  712 000 or 110   whichever is greater  of the previous year s salary  then the current club has both  right of first refusal  and rights to a draft pick from the same round  or better  from the signing club  Essentially  this means that the new club must forfeit the draft pick to the old club if they wish to sign the player under these terms  If a club tenders an offer of  1 552 million or 110   whichever is greater  of the previous year s salary  then the current club has both  right of first refusal   and rights to the first round draft pick from the signing club  47  In 2011  free agency guidelines returned to the way they were from 1993 to 2009  This means that a player needs four years of experience to become an unrestricted free agent  and three years of experience for restricted free agency  37   edit  Unrestricted free agent A player who has four or more years of experience is eligible for unrestricted free agency  whereby his current team has no guaranteed right to match outside offers to that player  This means that players in this category have unlimited rights to negotiate any terms with any team  47   edit  Free agency changes in 2010 In 2010  the CBA was not extended  thus the rules changed so that players don t become  Unrestricted Free Agents  until they have at least six years of experience  They will be  Restricted Free Agents  if they have three five years of experience  There will also be limitations imposed on which clubs are allowed to sign free agents  This is part of a set of rule changes written into the CBA designed to encourage the owners and the NFLPA to negotiate a new CBA  the players lose some free agency rights  and the owners lose the salary cap  33   edit  Franchise tag For more details on this topic  see Franchise tag  The franchise tag is a designation given to a player by a franchise that guarantees that player a contract the average of the five highest paid players of that same position in the entire league  or 120  of the player s previous year s salary  whichever is greater  in return for retaining rights to that player for one year  An NFL franchise may only designate one player a year as having the franchise tag  and may designate the same player for consecutive years  This has caused some tension between some NFL franchise designees and their respective teams due to the fact that a player designated as a franchise player precludes that player from pursuing large signing bonuses that are common in unrestricted free agency  and also prevents a player from leaving the team  especially when the reasons for leaving are not necessarily financial  A team may  at their discretion  allow the franchise player to negotiate with other clubs  but if he signs with another club  the first club is entitled to two first round draft picks in compensation  47   edit  Banned substances policy The NFL banned substances policy has been acclaimed by some 48  and criticized by others  49  but the policy is the longest running in American professional sports  beginning in 1987  48  The current policy of the NFL suspends players without pay who test positive for banned substances as it has since 1989  four games for the first offense  a quarter of the regular season   eight games for a second offense  half of the regular season   and 12 months for a third offense  50  The suspended games may be either regular season games or playoff games  50  While recently MLB and the NHL decided to permanently ban athletes for a third offense  they have long been resistant to such measures  and random testing is in its infancy  51  52  Since the NFL started random  year round tests and suspending players for banned substances  many more players have been found to be in violation of the policy  By April 2005  111 NFL players had tested positive for banned substances  and of those 111  the NFL suspended 54  49  A new rule is in the works due to Shawne Merriman  Starting the 2007 season  the new rule would prohibit any player testing positive for banned substances from being able to play in the Pro Bowl that year  53  In 2009  nearly 1 in 10 retired NFL players polled in a confidential survey said they had used now banned anabolic steroids while still playing  16 3 percent of offensive linemen admitted using steroids  as did 14 8 percent of defensive linemen  54   edit  Video games There have been several American football video games based on NFL teams created for various consoles over the years  from 10 Yard Fight and the Tecmo Bowl series for the NES to the more well known Madden series that have been released annually since 1988  The Madden series is named after former coach and American football commentator John Madden  Prior to the 2005 2006 football season  other NFL games were produced by competing video game publishers  such as 2K Games and Midway Games  However  in December 2004  Electronic Arts signed a five year exclusive agreement with the NFL  meaning only Electronic Arts will be permitted to publish games featuring NFL team and player names  This prompted video game developer Midway Games to release a game in 2005 called Blitz  The League  with fictitious teams and players  In February 2008  EA Sports renewed their exclusivity agreement with the league through Super Bowl XLVII in 2013  55  A free flash based online game called Quick Hit Football was released in 2009 and was granted an official NFL license in 2010   edit  Management Commissioners and

List of NFL franchise owners Unlike many professional leagues  the NFL forbids corporate owners  Ownership groups must contain twenty four or fewer individuals  and at least one partner must hold a thirty percent or greater share of the team  The Green Bay Packers are an exemption to the current policy  since they have been a publicly owned stock corporation since before the rule was in place  57  In recent years  NFL owners and the NFL itself have become politically active  donating millions of dollars to political candidates  58   edit  Uniform numbers Main article  Uniform number  American football  In the NFL  players wear uniform numbers based on the position they play  The current system was instituted into the league on April 5  1973  59  as a means for fans and officials  referees  linesmen  to more easily identify players on the field by their position  Players who were already in the league at that date were grandfathered and did not have to change their uniform numbers if they did not conform  Since that date  players are invariably assigned numbers within the following ranges  based on their primary position  Quarterbacks  Placekickers and Punters  1 19 Wide Receivers  10 19 and 80 89 Running Backs and Defensive Backs  20 49 Offensive Linemen  50 79 Linebackers  50 59 and 90 99  or 40 49 if all are taken Defensive Linemen  50 79 and 90 99 Tight Ends  80 89  or 40 49 Prior to 2004  wide receivers were allowed to wear only numbers 80 89  60  The NFL changed the rule that year to allow wide receivers to wear numbers 10 19 to allow for the increased number of players at wide receiver and tight end coming into the league  Linebackers are allowed to wear numbers between 40 49 when all of the numbers 50 59 and 90 99 are taken  Prior to that  players were allowed to wear non standard numbers only if their team had run out of numbers within the prescribed number range  Keyshawn Johnson began wearing number 19 in 1996 because the New York Jets had run out of numbers in the 80s  Oakland Raider offensive center Jim Otto wore a 00 jersey during most of his career with the AFL team and kept the number after the leagues merged  Devin Hester is a wide receiver return specialist for the Chicago Bears but wears number 23 because he was drafted as a cornerback but transferred to wide receiver after his rookie year  Occasionally  players will petition the NFL to allow them to wear a number that is not in line with the numbering system  Brad Van Pelt  a linebacker who entered the NFL in 1973 with the New York Giants  wore number 10 during his eleven seasons with the club  despite not being covered by the grandfather clause  In 2006  New Orleans Saints running back Reggie Bush petitioned the NFL to let him keep the number 5 which he used at USC  His request was later denied  61  Former Seattle Seahawks standout Brian Bosworth attempted such a petition in 1987  to wear his collegiate number of 44 at the linebacker position which he used at the University of Oklahoma   also without success  The Seahawks attempted to get around the rule by listing Bosworth as a safety  but after he wore number 44 for a game against the Kansas City Chiefs  the NFL ruled Bosworth would have to switch back to his original number  55  To aid the officials in spotting certain penalties  such as  illegal formation  or  ineligible receiver   usually only offensive players with numbers 1 49 and 80 89 are allowed to play at the end or back positions or handle the ball in normal game situations  However  a player wearing 50 79 or 90 99 may play in an  eligible  position simply by reporting to the referee that he will be doing so  The NFL numbering system is based on a player s primary position  Any player wearing any number may play at any position on the field at any time  subject to the reporting rules described above  It is not uncommon for running backs to line up at wide receiver on certain plays  or even to have a large offensive or defensive lineman play at fullback or tight end in short yardage situations  Also  in preseason games  when teams have expanded rosters  players may wear numbers that are outside of the above rules  When the final 53 player roster is established  they are reissued numbers within the above guidelines   edit  Awards AFC Championship Game  Lamar Hunt Trophy  Don Shula NFL High School
