bowl shaped valley at the confluence of the Susquehanna and Chenango Rivers  Binghamton is the county seat of Broome County and is the principal city and cultural center of the Greater Binghamton metropolitan area  also known as the Triple Cities   home to a quarter million people  3  The population of the city itself  according to the 2010 census  is 47 376  2  From the days of the railroad  Binghamton was a transportation crossroads and a manufacturing center  and has been known at different times for the production of cigars  shoes  and high tech products  IBM was founded nearby  and Edwin Link invented the flight simulator in the city  leading to a notable concentration of electronics  and defense oriented firms that continue to exist to this day  The population of the city has declined significantly in the second half of the 20th century  from a high of 85 000 in 1950  as a result of suburbanization and economic stagnation  The region lost a significant portion of its manufacturing industry  following cuts made by defense firms after the end of the Cold War  Some  but not all  of these jobs have been replaced by significant retail development and the growth of the region as an educational center  Today  Greater Binghamton is home to Binghamton University  a driving force in the community as an academic  athletic  and arts center  along with a continued concentration of high tech firms  including Lockheed Martin  IBM  BAE Systems  and Rockwell Collins  Contents 1 History 1 1 Valley of Opportunity  Growth as a manufacturing hub 1 2 Later development 2

History Bird s eye view c  1910  looking west down Court Street from county courthouse The city was named after William Bingham  a wealthy Philadelphian who bought the surrounding land in 1792  Before that  the first known people of European descent to come to the area were the troops of the Sullivan Expedition in 1779  during the American Revolutionary War  The community was first settled around 1802 at the junction of the Susquehanna and Chenango rivers and was known as Chenango Point  Binghamton was first incorporated in 1834 as a village of the Town of Binghamton  Binghamton became a city in 1867  Abel Bennett  who was elected as secretary on January 30  1845 of the Pennsylvania Coal Company  was the city s first mayor  His extensive property on the city s west side is known as the Abel Bennett Tract  4  The New York State Inebriate Asylum opened in 1858 on the eastern end of Binghamton  5  It was the first ever center to treat alcoholism as a disease  but by 1879 was converted into a hospital for the mentally ill  The main hospital building  designed by Isaac Perry  is now a New York State and National Historical Landmark  This facility is currently being developed as a clinical campus for Upstate Medical University   edit  Valley of Opportunity  Growth as a manufacturing hub An early Link Flight Simulator  invented in Binghamton in 1929 Originally an agricultural market town  the construction of the Erie Railroad  now Norfolk Southern  in the 1840s made Binghamton the commercial and then the manufacturing hub of the Southern Tier of New York and the adjacent counties in Pennsylvania  The railroad was absolutely vital to the development of Binghamton  Prior to railroads the only economical means of transportation of goods was via water  and the Susquehanna River is not navigable between Binghamton and the Atlantic coast  Equally important  the railroad cut travel time from Binghamton to New York City  the most rapidly growing area of the United States  from 5 days to 12 hours  Binghamton was nicknamed the Parlor City for its neat streets and attractive homes  including many stately mansions  During the late 19th and early 20th centuries  many immigrants moved to the area  finding an abundance of jobs  leading them to call it the Valley of Opportunity  Early on  Binghamton had been the second largest manufacturer of cigars in the United States  However  by the early 1920s  the major employer of the region became Endicott Johnson  a shoe manufacturer whose development of welfare capitalism resulted in many amenities for local residents  Binghamton s population began growing rapidly from this influx  with many European immigrants settling in the area  During the Second World War  this growth continued as IBM  which was founded in Greater Binghamton  began emerging as a global leader in technology  IBM s presence  coupled with Greater Binghamton being the birthplace of the Link flight simulator  led to an unusually large concentration of engineers living in the area  Other major manufacturers included Ansco and General Electric  Until the Cold War ended  the area never experienced an economic downfall  due in part to its defense heavy industries  The population of the city of Binghamton peaked at around 85 000 in 1950  Binghamton saw other companies grow during this time  Some of the more notable businesses included Valvoline  which started here before moving  and the Nineteen Hundred Washer Company  which merged to form Whirlpool  Another important  if dubious  product from the era was Swamp Root  a famous patent medicine developed in the late 19th century  The original Dick s Sporting Goods started out as a fishing store in the East Side of the City of Binghamton in 1948  and the business remained headquartered in Binghamton until 1994  6  In 1913  31 people perished in the Binghamton Clothing Company fire  which resulted in numerous reforms to the New York fire code  Major floods in 1935 and 1936 resulted in a number of deaths  and washed out the Ferry Street Bridge  now the Clinton Street Bridge   The floods were devastating  and resulted in the construction of flood walls along the length of the Susquehanna and Chenango Rivers   edit  Later development While employment and population steadily moved west to less crowded areas of Broome County during the early and mid 20th century  Binghamton maintained its place as the commercial  transportation  and retail center of the region up to about 1950  However  the long period of prosperity beginning in the late 1940s  which allowed most residents to acquire cars   also led new retail development to build on cheaper land along highways near the newer residential areas of Vestal and Endwell  These former hamlets became the most prosperous areas of Broome County after 1950 because of the enormous success of the then Endicott based International Business Machines Corporation  IBM   These new retail sites had large parking lots which proved to be a great advantage over retail businesses in downtown Binghamton  By the mid 1960s  most of the prosperous retail businesses in downtown Binghamton had moved to suburban sites  The acquisition of cars by local residents in the 1940s and 1950s also ended Binghamton s role as a transportation center  Demand for passenger rail service collapsed in the 1950s and trucking companies replaced the railroad for the transport of most goods  Increased car traffic resulted in the construction of the interstate model highway Route 17 through Binghamton and Johnson City in the early 1970s  replacing the Binghamton railroad station as the transportation hub of the region  In an effort to reverse these trends  urban renewal dominated much of the construction during the 1960s and early 1970s  with many of Binghamton s ornate buildings torn down during this period  The construction included the creation of Government Plaza  the Broome County Veterans Memorial Arena  and North Shore Dr   NY 363   In 1973  the Kopernik Space Center  the largest public observatory in the northeastern United States  was built  These well meaning efforts failed  and downtown Binghamton is now primarily a government center  not the regional center it once was  With the Cold War coming to a close  a large portion of the defense related industries in the area suffered severe cutbacks and closures  with several high profile sales scavenging many local firms  This was compounded by a large series of layoffs at IBM throughout the early 1990s  As a result  the region went into an economic recession  Today  the city is attempting to diversify its economic base in order to spur revitalization  Major emphasis has been put on Binghamton University  A downtown campus was built in 2007  and there are currently plans to create several student housing complexes downtown  In 2007  Binghamton was named the ninth greenest city in the U S  by Country Home magazine  7  Tragedy has also hit in recent years  While flooding has been common with Binghamton sitting at the confluence of two rivers  a major flood was able to overcome the city s flood walls and wreak havoc in June 2006  causing millions of dollars in damage  This occurred again in September 2011 as the remains of Tropical Storm Lee passed through the region  The city s American Civic Association is the location of the April 3  2009 shootings  which left 14 dead  8   edit  Geography Facing west towards the confluence of the Susquehanna  left  and Chenango  right  rivers  Confluence Park in downtown  2007 According to the United States Census Bureau  the city has a total area of 11 0 square miles  28 km2   10 4 square miles  27 km2  of it is land and 0 6 square miles  1 6 km2  of it  5 43   is water  The north branch of the Susquehanna River passes through downtown   This branch rises in eastern New York and receives a number of tributaries above Binghamton  most notably the Chenango  which joins from the north just outside of the business district  Major floods occurred in the city during 1865  1936 and 2006  and 2011  In 1935 the Chenango suffered a flash flood  which was damaging  but less severe once it joined the larger Susquehanna  So much water came from the Chenango  that the Susquehanna flowed backwards for some distance above the confluence  In 1972 the remnants of Hurricane Agnes flooded the entire Susquehanna basin downstream from Binghamton  but the damage in the city was minor  In 2006  the Susquehanna flooded again in Binghamton causing massive amounts of damage in the city and the entire metropolitan area  The Exchange Street and Washington Street bridges were flooded and the height of the river surpassed the flood walls on North Shore Drive  Court Street  and Conklin Ave  The damage was extensive enough to force large scale evacuations  including that of Lourdes Hospital which was unable to pump water out of its basement fast enough  Again in 2011  Binghamton experienced record flooding from the Chenango and Susquehanna rivers as a result of Tropical Storm Lee  From September 6th to September 8th Binghamton and the surrounding cities of Johnson City  Endicott  Conklin  and Union received over 10  of rain   edit  Climate Binghamton has a humid continental climate  K ppen Dfb   with cold  snowy winters and warm  wet summers  Snowfall is significant  with an annual total of 77 3 inches  196 cm   Binghamton is not as greatly affected by lake effect snow as the cities to the northwest  Syracuse  and closer to the Great Lakes  but persistent snow bands from the lakes do occasionally result in moderate snows  Binghamton receives significant snows at times during the year from Nor easter storms as well  Summers in Binghamton are typified by warmer  less humid days with occasional temperature spikes into the upper 80s and lower 90s  Higher temperatures have occurred  but are very uncommon  As with most cities in upstate New York  precipitation in Binghamton is spread evenly throughout the year  there is no  dry season   Climate data for Binghamton  New York  Greater Binghamton Airport   1981
