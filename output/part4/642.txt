Illegal immigration to the United States From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search An illegal immigrant in the United States is an alien  non citizen  who has entered the United States without government permission or stayed beyond the termination date of a visa  1  The undocumented immigrant population of the United States in 2008 was estimated by the Center for Immigration Studies to be about 11 million people  down from 12 5 million people in 2007  2  Other estimates range from 7 to 20 million  3  According to a Pew Hispanic Center report  in 2005  56  of undocumented immigrants were from Mexico  22  were from other Latin American countries  primarily from Central America  4  13  were from Asia  6  were from Europe and Canada  and 3  were from Africa

demographics Main article  Undocumented immigrant population of the United States Undocumented immigrants continue to outpace the number of legal immigrants a trend that s held steady since the 1990s  While the majority of undocumented immigrants continue to concentrate in places with existing large Hispanic communities  increasingly undocumented immigrants are settling throughout the rest of the country  5  An estimated 14 million people live in families in which the head of household or the spouse is an illegal immigrant  5  Illegal immigrants arriving in recent years tend to be better educated than those who have been in the country a decade or more  A quarter of all immigrants who have arrived in recent years have at least some college education  Nonetheless  illegal immigrants as a group tend to be less educated than other sections of the U S  population  49 percent haven t completed high school  compared with 9 percent of native born Americans and 25 percent of legal immigrants  5  Illegal immigrants work in many sectors of the U S  economy  According to National Public Radio in 2005  about 3 percent work in agriculture  33 percent have jobs in service industries  and substantial numbers can be found in construction and related occupations  16 percent   and in production  installation  and repair  17 percent   5  According to USA Today in 2006  about 4 percent work in farming  21 percent have jobs in service industries  and substantial numbers can be found in construction and related occupations  19 percent   and in production  installation  and repair  15 percent   with 12  in sales  10  in management  and 8  in transportation  6  Illegal immigrants have lower incomes than both legal immigrants and native born Americans  but earnings do increase somewhat the longer an individual is in the country  5  A percentage of illegal immigrants do not remain indefinitely but do return to their country of origin  they are often referred to as  sojourners  they come to the United States for several years but eventually return to their home country   7   edit  Breakdown by state As of 2006  8  self published source   the following data table shows a spread of distribution of locations where illegal immigrants reside by state  State of Residence of the Illegal Alien Population  January 2000 and 2006 State of residence Estimated population

18 333 Other states 2 950 000 26 69 200 000  edit  Number of illegal immigrants According to the Government Accountability Office  GAO   different estimates of the total number of undocumented persons are based on different definitions of the term  undocumented   9  There are also questions about data reliability  9  The GAO has stated that  it seems clear that the population of undocumented foreign born persons is large and has increased rapidly   9  On April 26  2006 the Pew Hispanic Center  PHC  estimated that in March 2005 the number of illegal immigrants in the U S  ranged from 11 5 to 12 million individuals  10  This number was derived by a statistical method known as the  residual method   9  According to the General Accounting office the residual estimation  1  starts with a census count or survey estimate of the number of foreign born residents who have not become U S  citizens and  2  subtracts out estimated numbers of legally present individuals in various categories  based on administrative data and assumptions  because censuses and surveys do not ask about legal status   The remainder  or residual  represents an indirect estimate of the size of the undocumented population  9  Using the residential method  several different estimates of the number of undocumented persons present in the United States have ben derived  In August  2006  the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  placed the  unauthorized  immigrant population at 10 5 million as of January 2005 and indicates that if recent trends continued  the figure for January 2006 would be 11 million  11  The Pew Hispanic Center s indirect estimate of the number of illegal immigrants as of 2006 was 11 5 million to 12 million  These estimates represented roughly one third of the entire foreign born population  12  According to the General Accounting Office  DHS had variously estimated the size of the undocumented population as of January 2000 as 7 million and 8 5 million  9  Some unofficial private estimates put the number even higher 13  From 2005 to 2009  the number of people entering the U S  illegally declined by nearly 67   according to the Pew Hispanic Center  from 850 000 yearly average in the early 2000s to 300 000  14   edit  Births The Pew Hispanic Center determined that according to an analysis of Census Bureau data about 8 percent of children born in the United States in 2008   about 340 000   were offspring of unauthorized immigrants  In total  4 million U S  born children of unauthorized immigrant parents resided in this country in 2009  alongside 1 1 million foreign born children of unauthorized immigrant parents   15  These babies are  according to the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution  American citizens from birth  These children are sometimes pejoratively referred to as anchor babies by those aggressively opposed to this method of citizenship attained outside of the legal immigration process  citation needed   edit  Present day countries of origin According to the U S  Department of Homeland Security  the countries of origin for the largest numbers of illegal immigrants are as follows  latest of 2009   16  Country of origin Raw number Percent of total Percent change 2000 to 2009 Mexico 6 650 000 62   42  El Salvador 530 000 5   25  Guatemala 480 000 4   65  Honduras 320 000 3   95  Philippines 270 000 2   33

undocumented Canadians currently live in the United States   17   edit  Definition People can be termed illegal immigrants in one of three ways  by entering without authorization or inspection  by staying beyond the authorized period after legal entry  or by violating the terms of legal entry  18  Their mode of violation breaks down as follows  If the suspect entered legally without inspection  then the suspect would be classified as either a  Non Immigrant Visa Overstayer   4 to 5 5 million  or a  Border Crossing Card Violator   250 000 to 500 000   Together  legal entries account for 4 5 6 million unauthorized migrants  just under half of the total population  If the suspect entered illegally without inspection  then the suspect would be classified as having  Evaded the Immigration Inspectors and Border Patrol   This mode of entry accounts for 6 to 7 million people  slightly more than half of the total population  19  Some prospective immigrants pay a  coyote  to assist them in entering the United States illegally  The cost of a coyote can be up to  17 000  citation needed  A person can be charged with illegally re entering the United States after being previously deported  The U S  Sentencing Guidelines prescribe up to a 16 level offense level increase  potentially causing more than a quadrupling of one s sentence  for illegal re entry of certain felons into the U S  20  The PROTECT Act instructed the U S  Sentencing Commission to authorize four level  fast track  downward departures in illegal reentry immigration cases upon motion of the prosecutor  21   edit  Illegal entry Main article  Illegal entry United States The Pew Hispanic Center estimates that 6 7 million unauthorized migrants came to the United States via illegal entry  accounting for probably a little over half of the total population  19  There are an estimated half million illegal entries into the United States each year  19  22  A common means of border crossing is to hire professionals who smuggle illegal immigrants across the border for pay  Those operating on the US Mexico border are known informally as  coyotes   22   edit  Visa overstay According to Pew  between 4 and 5 5 million unauthorized migrants entered the United States with a legal visa  accounting for between 33 50  of the total population  19  A tourist or traveler is considered a  visa overstay  once he or she remains in the United States after the time of admission has expired  The time of admission varies greatly from traveler to traveler depending on what visa class into which they were admitted  Visa overstays tend to be somewhat more educated and better off financially than those who entered the country illegally  23  To help track visa overstayers the US VISIT  United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology  program collects and retains biographic  travel  and biometric information  such as photographs and fingerprints  of foreign nationals seeking entry into the United States  It also requires electronic readable passports containing this information  Visa overstayers mostly enter with tourist or business visas  19  In 1994  more than half 24  of illegal immigrants were Visa overstayers whereas in 2006  about 45  of illegal immigrants were Visa overstayers  25   edit  Border Crossing Card violation A smaller number of unauthorized migrants entered the United States legally using the Border Crossing Card  a card that authorizes border crossings into the U S  for a set amount of time  Border Crossing Card entry accounts for the vast majority of all registered non immigrant entry into the United States   148 million out of 179 million total   but there is little hard data as to how much of the illegal immigrant population entered in this way  The Pew Hispanic Center estimates the number at around 250 000 500 000  19   edit  Causes Main article  Illegal immigration Causes The United States is viewed worldwide as a highly desirable destination by would be migrants  International polls by the Gallup organization have found that more than 165 million adults in 148 foreign countries would  if they could  move to the US  which is the most desired destination for migrants  26   edit  Economic incentives This section requires expansion  The continuing practice of hiring unauthorized workers has been referred to as  the magnet for illegal immigration   27  As a significant percentage of employers are willing to hire illegal immigrants for higher pay than they would typically receive in their former country  illegal immigrants have prime motivation to cross borders  In 2003  then President of Mexico  Vicente Fox stated that remittances  are our biggest source of foreign income  bigger than oil  tourism or foreign investment  and that  the money transfers grew after Mexican consulates started giving identity cards to their citizens in the United States   He stated that money sent from Mexican workers in the United States to their families back home reached a record  12 billion  28  Two years later  in 2005  the World Bank stated that Mexico was receiving  18 1 billion in remittances and that it ranked third  behind only India and China  among the countries receiving the greatest amount of remittances  29  United States policy reforms aimed at helping the lower class often have unintended effects associated with them besides their intended target  For example  a policy put in place in a border state such as Texas or Arizona aimed at making receiving government assistance easier to lower class people  makes other people want to move to these states  An externality to this policy procedure could be the increased illegal immigration of the Hispanic population to the United States as the poor population lives better in the US than in their home country  According to the World Bank  in 2002 half of the Mexican population was living in poverty and one fifth of the population was living in extreme poverty  The National Poverty Center at the University of Michigan 30  found in 2009 only 14 3 percent of the population in the US lived in poverty  According to Tom Rex  who studies Arizona economy for the Arizona State University s W P  Carey School of Business  31  said immigration crackdowns  notably the state s employer sanctions law  have driven more undocumented workers from the aboveground economy into the underground cash economy  This in turn means less tax revenue for the state of Arizona since undocumented workers who work aboveground pay income taxes according to the Arizona Republic  31  Illegal immigrants boost the local economy by purchasing goods and services  Clint Hickman Vice President of Sales and Marketing at Hickman Family Farms  the largest egg producer in Arizona has said sales to supermarkets that cater to Latinos has dropped 20 percent since the passage of SB1070  31   edit  Chain immigration This section requires expansion  According to demographer Jeffery Passel of the Pew Hispanic Center  the flow of Mexicans to the U  S  has produced a  network effect    furthering immigration as Mexicans moved to join relatives already in the U S  32  The Pew Hispanic Center describes that the recent dramatic increase in the population of illegal immigrants has sparked more illegal immigrants to cross borders  Once the extended families of illegal immigrants cross national borders  they create a  network effect  by building large communities  32  neutrality is disputed   edit  US government inefficiencies Analysts who   believe that costs  delays  and inefficiencies in processing visa applications and work permits contribute to the number of immigrants who immigrate without authorization  33  As of 2007 there was a backlog of 1 1 million green card applications  and the typical waiting time was three years  34   edit  Trade agreements and government failures The Rockridge Institute argues that globalization and trade agreement affected international migration  as laborers moved to where they could find jobs  Raising the standard of living around the world  a promise the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   Central American Free Trade Agreement  CAFTA   the World Trade Organization  WTO   the International Monetary Fund  IMF   and the World Bank  would reduce the economic incentive for illegal immigration  35   edit  Lobbying Several ethnic lobbies support immigration reforms that would allow illegal immigrants that have succeeded in entering to gain citizenship  They may also lobby for special arrangements for their own group  The Chairman for the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform has stated that  the Irish Lobby will push for any special arrangement it can get    as will every other ethnic group in the country    36  37   edit  International controversies  edit  Mexican federal and state government assistance The US Department of Homeland Security and some advocacy groups have criticized a program of the government of the state of Yucatan and that of a federal Mexican agency directed to Mexicans migrating to and residing in the United States  They claim that the assistance includes advice on how to get across the U S  border illegally  where to find healthcare  enroll their children in public schools  and send money to Mexico  The Mexican federal government also issues identity cards to Mexicans living outside of Mexico  38  39  In 2005 the government of Yucatan produced a handbook and DVD about the risks and implications of crossing the U S  Mexico border  The guide told immigrants where to find health care  how to get their kids into U S  schools  and how to send money home  Officials in Yucatan said the guide is a necessity to save lives but some American groups accused the government of encouraging illegal immigration  40  In 2005 the Mexican government was criticized for distributing a comic book which offers tips to illegal aliens emigrating to the United States  41  That comic book recommends to illegal immigrants  once they have safely crossed the border   Don t call attention to yourself      Avoid loud parties      Don t become involved in fights   The Mexican government defends the guide as an attempt to save lives   It s kind of like illegal immigration for dummies   said the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington  Mark Krikorian   Promoting safe illegal immigration is not the same as arguing against it   The comic book does state on its last page that the Mexican Government does not promote illegal crossing at all and only encourages visits to the U S  with all required documentation  41  Groups in favor of application and enforcement of current immigration law oppose Matr cula Consular   Consular Registration    an identification card issued by the Government of Mexico through its consulate offices  The purpose of the card is to demonstrate that the bearer is a Mexican national living outside of Mexico  Similar consular identification cards are the Guatemalan CID card and the Argentinian CID card as well as a number of other CID cards issued to citizens of Colombia  El Salvador  and Honduras  42  The document is accepted at financial institutions in many states and  in conjunction with an IRS Taxpayer Identification Number  allows illegal immigrants to open checking and saving accounts  43  California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former President Bill Clinton promote the use of foreign government CID cards in U S  financial institutions  44  In December 2008  Governor Schwarzenegger launched Bank on California which calls on California mayors to specifically encourage the use of the Mexican CID and Guatemalan CID card by banks and credit unions as a primary identification when opening an account  45   edit  Legal issues  edit  Immigration laws Main article  United States nationality law Main article  List of United States immigration laws Immigrants can be classified as illegal for one of three reasons  entering without authorization or inspection  staying beyond the authorized period after legal entry  or violating the terms of legal entry  46  Section 1325 in Title 8 of the United States Code   Improper entry of alien   provides for a fine  imprisonment  or both for any immigrant who  47  enters or attempts to enter the United States at any time or place other than as designated by immigration agents  or eludes examination or inspection by immigration agents  or attempts to enter or obtains entry to the United States by a willfully false or misleading representation or the willful concealment of a material fact  The maximum prison term is 6 months for the first offense and 2 years for any subsequent offense  In addition to the above criminal fines and penalties  civil fines may also be imposed  Arizona  which passed immigration enforcement law Arizona SB 1070 in April 2010  is currently the  toughest bill on illegal immigration  in the United States  48  and is being challenged by the Department of Justice as encroaching on powers reserved by the United States Constitution to the Federal Government  48  On July 28  2010  United States district court judge Susan Bolton issued a preliminary injunction affecting the most controversial parts of the law  including the section that required police officers to check a person s immigration status after a person had been involved in another act or situation which resulted in police activity  49  The Mexican Constitution grants citizens freedom to travel  The Constitution stipulates also that the right to cross border migration is authorized only if other applicable laws and requirements are observed  and when certain prerequisites have been met  50   edit  Prevention Main article  United States Mexico barrier The cost to immigrate illegally has also increased  encouraging longer stays to recoup the cost  citation needed  Tens of thousands of illegal Mexican immigrants head each year in the direction of Mexico  citation needed  While no statistics are kept on this reverse migration  researchers in both countries suggest that the numbers have declined as border controls have tightened  51  In October 2008  Mexico agreed to deport Cubans using the country as an entry point to the US  Then Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe P rez Roque said the Cuban Mexican agreement would lead to  the immense majority of Cubans being repatriated   52   edit  Workplace investigations Audits of employment records in 2009 at American Apparel  a prominent Los Angeles garment manufacturer  by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency  ICE  uncovered discrepancies in the documentation of about 25 percent of the company s workers  This technique of auditing employment records originated during the George W  Bush presidency and has been continued under President Obama  It may result in deportations should definite evidence of illegality be uncovered  but at American Apparel the audit resulted only in the termination of employees who could not resolve discrepancies  Most fired workers  some of whom had worked a decade at the plant  reported that they would seek other employment within the United States  This technique of enforcement is much less disruptive than mass raids at workplaces  but is not popular with employers who feel targeted and threatened  53   edit  Apprehension US ICE  USBP  and CBP enforce the INA  and to some extent the United States military  local law enforcement and other local agencies  and private citizens and citizen groups guard the border  citation needed   edit  At border The U S  Customs and Border Protection is responsible for apprehending individuals attempting illegal entry to the United States  The United States Border Patrol is its mobile uniformed law enforcement arm  responsible for deterrence  detection  and apprehension of those who enter the United States without authorization from the government and outside the designated ports of entry  citation needed  In December 2005  the U S  House of Representatives voted to build a separation barrier along parts of the border not already protected by separation barriers  A later vote in the United States Senate on May 17  2006  included a plan to blockade 860 miles  1 380 km  of the border with vehicle barriers and triple layer fencing along with granting an  earned path to citizenship  to the 12 million illegal aliens in the U S  and roughly doubling legal immigration  from their 1970s levels  citation needed    In 2007 Congress approved a plan calling for more fencing along the Mexican border  with funds for approximately 700 miles  1 100 km  of new fencing  citation needed   If immigrants  whether legal or illegal  are apprehended entering the US while committing a crime  they are usually charged under federal statutes and  if convicted  are sent to federal prisons   54   edit  At workplace For decades  immigration authorities have alerted   no match letters   55  employers of mismatches between reported employees  Social Security cards and the actual names of the card holders  On September 1  2007  a federal judge halted this practice of alerting employers of card mismatches  56  Illegal hiring has not been prosecuted aggressively in recent years  between 1999 and 2003  according to The Washington Post   work site enforcement operations were scaled back 95 percent by the Immigration and Naturalization Service  57  Major employers of illegal immigrants have included  Wal Mart  In 2005  Wal Mart agreed to pay  11 million to settle a federal investigation that found hundreds of illegal immigrants were hired by Wal Mart s cleaning contractors  58  Swift  amp  Co   In December 2006  in the largest such crackdown in American history  U S  federal immigration authorities raided Swift  amp  Co  meat processing plants in six U S  states  arresting about 1 300 illegal immigrant employees  59  Tyson Foods  This company has also been accused of actively importing illegal labor for its chicken packing plants  however  the jury acquitted the company after evidence was presented that Tyson went beyond mandated government requirements in demanding documentation for its employees  60  Gebbers Farms  In December 2009  US immigration authorities forced this Brewster  Washington farm known for its fruit orchards to fire more than 500 illegal workers  mostly immigrants from Mexico  Some were working with false social security cards and other false identification  61  El Paso  top  and Ciudad Ju rez  bottom  seen from earth orbit  the Rio Grande is the thin line separating the two cities through the middle of the photograph   edit  Detention Main article  Immigration detention in the United States About 40  of illegal immigrants enter legally and then overstay  7  About 31 000 people who are not American citizens are held in immigration detention on any given day  62  including children  in over 200 detention centers  jails  and prisons nationwide  The United States government held more than 300 000 people in immigration detention in 2007 while deciding whether to deport them  63   edit  Deportation An individual s deportation is determined in removal proceedings  administrative proceedings under United States immigration law  citation needed  Removal proceedings are typically conducted in Immigration Court  the Executive Office for Immigration Review  by an immigration judge  citation needed  Deportations from the United States increased by more than 60 percent from 2003 to 2008  with Mexicans accounting for nearly two thirds of those deported  64  Under the Obama administration  deportations have increased to record levels beyond the level reached by the George W  Bush administration with a projected 400 000 deportations in 2010  10 percent above the deportation rate of 2008 and 25 percent above 2007  65 Fiscal year 2011 saw 396 906 deportations  the largest number in the history of U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  of those  216 698 had been convicted of crimes  including  66  44 653 convicted of  drug related crimes  35 927 convicted of driving under the influence 5 848 convicted of sexual offenses 1 119 convicted of homicide  edit  Complications Complications in deportation efforts ensue when parents are illegal immigrants but their children are birthright citizens  Federal appellate courts have upheld the refusal by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to stay the deportation of illegal immigrants merely on the grounds that they have U S  citizen  minor children  67  There are some 3 1 million United States citizen children with at least one illegal immigrant parent as of 2005  at least 13 000 American children had one or both parents deported in the years 2005 2007  68  69  Such was the case of Mexican Elvira Arellano  who sought sanctuary at a Chicago area church in an effort to impede immigration authorities from separating her and her eight year old  U S  born son  This is also the case in the instance of Sadia Umanzor  an illegal immigrant from Honduras and the central figure of a November 17  2007  New York Times story  Umanzor was a fugitive from a 2006 deportation order  She was recently arrested  in anticipation of deportation  However  a judge postponed that deportation proceeding  The judge placed her under house arrest  citing her six month old U S  born baby as the factor  70   edit  Mass deportation According to The Washington Post  71  Rajeev K  Goyle  of the Center for American Progress  a liberal Washington think tank  says he conducted a study to respond to conservative officials who have advocated mass deportations  This study claims that the cost of forcibly removing most of the nation s estimated 10 million illegal immigrants is  41 billion a year  A spokesman for Rep  Tom Tancredo calls the study  useless  because no one s talking about employing mass deportation as a tactic  Mark Krikorian  executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies  describes the study as a cartoon version of how enforcement would work  There have been two major periods of mass deportations in U S  history  In the Mexican Repatriation of the 1930s  through mass deportations and forced migration  an estimated 500 000 Mexicans and Mexican Americans were deported or coerced into emigrating  in what Mae Ngai  an immigration history expert at the University of Chicago  has described as  a racial removal program   72  The majority of those removed were U S  Citizens  72  Rep  Luis Gutierrez  D Ill   cosponsor of a U S  House Bill that calls for a commission to study the  deportation and coerced emigration  of U S  citizens and legal residents  has expressed concerns that history could repeat itself  and that should illegal immigration be made into a felony  this could prompt a  massive deportation of U S  citizens   72  Later  in Operation Wetback in 1954  when the United States last deported a sizable number of illegal immigrants  in some cases along with their U S  born children  who are citizens according to U S  law   73  some illegal immigrants  fearful of potential violence as police swarmed through Mexican American barrios throughout the southeastern states  stopping  Mexican looking  citizens on the street and asking for identification  fled to Mexico  73   edit  Kennedy Jurisprudence The U S  Supreme Court on June 16  2008 ruled  5 4   that someone who is here illegally may withdraw his voluntary agreement to depart and continue to try to get approval to remain in the United States   The lawsuit is about two seemingly contradictory provisions of immigration law  One prevents deportation by voluntary departure from the country  The other section allows immigrants who are here illegally but whose circumstances changed to build their case to immigration officials  and must remain in the US  In the case  Samson Dada  a Nigerian citizen  overstayed beyond the expiration of his tourist visa in 1998  Immigration authorities ordered him to leave the country as he agreed to leave voluntarily  to allow his legal re entry then if he had been deported  74  75   edit  Police and military involvement In 1995  the United States Congress considered an exemption from the Posse Comitatus Act  which generally prohibits direct participation of Department of Defense personnel in civilian law enforcement activities  such as search  seizure  and arrests  76  In 1997  Marines shot and killed 18 year old U S  citizen Esequiel Hern ndez Jr 77  while on a mission to interdict smuggling and illegal immigration near the border community of Redford  Texas  The Marines observed the high school student from concealment while he was tending his family s goats in the vicinity of their ranch  At one point  Hernandez raised his  22 caliber rifle and fired shots in the direction of the concealed soldiers  He was subsequently tracked for 20 minutes then shot and killed  78  79  In reference to the incident  military lawyer Craig T  Trebilcock argues that  the fact that armed military troops were placed in a position with the mere possibility that they would have to use force to subdue civilian criminal activity reflects a significant policy shift by the executive branch away from the posse comitatus doctrine   80  The killing of Hernandez led to a congressional review 81  and an end to a nine year old policy of the military aiding the Border Patrol  82  After the September 11 attacks in 2001  the United States again considered placing soldiers along the U S  Mexico border as a security measure  83  In May 2006  President George W  Bush announced plans to use the National Guard to strengthen enforcement of the US Mexico Border from illegal immigrants  84  emphasizing that Guard units  will not be involved in direct law enforcement activities   85  Mexican Foreign Secretary Luis Ernesto Derbez said in an interview with a Mexico City radio station   If we see the National Guard starting to directly participate in detaining people     we would immediately start filing lawsuits through our consulates   86  The American Civil Liberties Union  ACLU  called on the President not to deploy military troops to deter immigrants  and stated that a  deployment of National Guard troops violates the spirit of the Posse Comitatus Act   87  According to the State of the Union address in January 2007  88  more than 6000 National Guard members have been sent to the US Mexico border to supplement the Border Patrol  89  costing in excess of  750 million  90   edit  Sanctuary cities Main article  Sanctuary city Several US cities have instructed their own law enforcement personnel and other city employees not to notify or cooperate with the federal government when they become aware of illegal immigrants living within their jurisdiction  Many cities  including Washington  D C   New York City NYC  Los Angeles  Chicago  San Francisco  91 San Diego  Austin  Salt Lake City  Dallas  Detroit  Houston  Jersey City  Minneapolis  Miami  Denver  Aurora  Colorado  Baltimore  Seattle  Portland  Oregon  Portland  Maine  and Senath  Missouri  have become  sanctuary cities   having adopted ordinances banning police from asking people about their immigration status  92  Most of these cities claim that the benefit illegal immigrants bring to their city outweigh the costs  Opponents say the measures violate federal law as the cities are in effect creating their own immigration policy  an area of law which only Congress has authority to alter  93   edit  Community based involvement According to a 2006 report by the Anti Defamation League  white supremacists and other extremists were engaging in a growing number of assaults against legal and illegal immigrants and those perceived to be immigrants  94  The Indian reservations along the US Mexico border are being inundated with illegal aliens passing through their lands  leaving debris and waste  as well as committing crimes on tribal lands  95  They have asked the US Government to stop the large number of illegal aliens as they are unable to do so  The No More Deaths organization offers food  water  and medical aid to migrants crossing the desert regions of the American Southwest in an effort to reduce the increasing number of deaths along the border  96   edit  Impacts  edit  Economic Main article  Economic impact of illegal immigrants in the United States  edit  Wages and employment George J  Borjas  an economist at Harvard University  has argued that illegal immigration may reduce the economic status of U S  poor while benefiting middle class individuals and wealthier Americans  97  verification needed  The presence of illegal immigrants and the exploitation of them may drive down wages for certain sectors of the American populace  further widening the socioeconomic gulf between rich and poor  98  Research by Borjas  Jeffrey Grogger  and Gordon H  Hanson suggests that a 10 percent immigrant induced increase in the supply of a particular skill group reduced the black wage by 4 0 percent  lowered the employment rate of black men by 3 5 percentage points  and increased the incarceration rate of blacks by almost one percent  99  These claims are supported by impressive credentials  but not by census data  100  The illegal immigrant population in the United States produces an annual economic consumer demand of approximately  150 billion  101  The direct economic impact of  150 billion in consumer demand from illegal immigrants directly employs just under 8 million people  or about 5  of the United States workforce  102   edit  Consumer demand Texas has the second highest population of illegal immigrants  and The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas indicates that putting a halt to current deportation policies will improve the US economy by encouraging increased economic consumption  103  The decline in consumer demand created by declining immigrant population matches the start of the Great Recession that began with foreclosures in 2007  104  An almost identical economic decline occurred from 1929 through 1937 during the period of Mexican Repatriation following the Mexican Revolution  when over half a million illegal immigrants and legal US citizens of Latin descent were forcibly deported out of the country following racist campaigns by most news organizations within the US  105  106  Reverse migration of illegal immigrants from the US back to Mexico has reduced consumer demand in the United States due to an overall decline in the population  107  108  109  110  111  According to the Center for Immigration Studies  US Census estimates indicate 6 of 7 illegal immigrants are leaving the country on their own  so this trend has nothing to do with border enforcement and deportation efforts  112   edit  Taxes and social services Illegal immigrants are estimated to pay in about  7 billion per year into Social Security  113  A paper in the peer reviewed Tax Lawyer journal from the American Bar Association asserts that illegal immigrants contribute more in taxes than they cost in social services  114  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reviewed 29 reports published over 15 years to evaluate the impact of unauthorized immigrants on the budgets of state and local governments  and found that the tax revenues that unauthorized immigrants generate for state and local governments do not offset the total cost of services provided to those immigrants  but that the amount that state and local governments spend on services for unauthorized immigrants represents a small percentage of the total amount spent by those governments to provide such services to residents in their jurisdictions  115   edit  Mortgages Around 2005  an increasing number of banks saw illegal immigrants as an untapped resource for growing their own revenue stream and contended that providing illegal aliens with mortgages would help revitalize local communities  with many community banks providing home loans for illegal immigrants  116   edit  Law enforcement expenses  edit  Apprehension  amp  deportation Border control uses the latest technology to help capture illegal immigrants in the process of crossing  sometimes detain prosecute  and send them back over the border  According to the US Department of Homeland Security and the Border Patrol Enforcement Integrated Database  apprehensions have increased from 955 310 in 2002 to 1 159 802 in 2004   But fewer than 4 percent of apprehended migrants were actually detained and prosecuted for illegal entry  partly because it costs  90 a day to keep them in detention facilities and bed space is very limited  For the remainder of the apprehended migrants  if they are willing to sign a form attesting that they are voluntarily repatriating themselves  they are simply bussed to a gate on the border  where they re enter Mexico   117  verification needed   During the summer of 2004  the U S  government pressured the Mexican government into accepting  deep repatriation  of as many as 300 apprehended migrants per day to six cities in central and southern Mexico   edit  Crimes committed by illegal immigrants California has the largest immigrant population in the US  and immigrants are under represented among prison inmates  118  The most recent research indicates approximately 35  of the California population consists of immigrants  while immigrants represent 17  of the prison population  This implies that immigrants are about half as likely to become involved in crime  although deporting illegal immigrants soon after incarceration lowers the immigrant prison population  In fact  U S  born adult men are incarcerated at a rate over two and a half times greater than that of foreign born men  118  However  this does not separate the illegal versus legal immigrants  The fastest growing prison demographic are functionally illiterate adult male US citizens  which is over represented by the children of immigrants that failed to obtain an education because of the English only movement   119  Illegal immigrants avoid involvement in criminal activity to reduce interaction with law enforcement officials  and evidence shows a decline in crime correlates with an increase in immigration in most large cities  120  According to Edmonton and Smith in The New Americans  Economic  Demographic  and Fiscal Effects of Immigration   it is difficult to draw any strong conclusions on the association between immigration and crime   54  Cities with large immigrant populations showed larger reductions in property and violent crime than cities without large immigrant populations  121  Almost all of what is known about immigration and crime is from information on those in prison  Incarceration rates do not necessarily reflect differences in current crime rates  54  The Center for Immigration Studies in a 2009 report argued that  New government data indicate that immigrants have high rates of criminality  while older academic research found low rates  The overall picture of immigrants and crime remains confused due to a lack of good data and contrary information   It also criticized reports using data from the 2000 Census according to which 4  of prisoners were immigrants  Non citizens often have a strong incentive to deny this in order to prevent deportation and there are also other problems  Some better but still uncertain methods have found that 20 22  of prisoners were immigrants  It also criticized studies looking at percentages of immigrants in a city and crime for only looking at overall crime and not immigrant crime as well as having other possible problems  122  As of 2010  the U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency  ICE  under its  Secure Communities  project has identified 240 000 illegal immigrants convicted of crimes  according to Department of Homeland Security figures  Of those  about 30 000 have been deported  including 8 600 convicted of what the agency calls  the most egregious offenses  123  A few of the other reasons also cited for why the extent of illegal immigrants  criminal activities is unknown are as follows  For many minor crimes  especially crimes involving juveniles  those who are apprehended are not arrested  Only a fraction of those who are arrested are ever brought to the courts for disposition  54  Many illegal immigrants who are apprehended by Border Patrol agents are voluntarily returned to their home countries and are not ordinarily tabulated in national crime statistics  If immigrants  whether illegal or legal  are apprehended entering the United States while committing a crime  they are usually charged under federal statutes and  if convicted  are sent to federal prisons  Throughout this entire process  immigrants may have a chance of deportation  or of sentencing that is different from that for a native born person  54  We lack comprehensive information on whether arrested or jailed immigrants are illegal immigrants  nonimmigrants  or legal immigrants  Such information can be difficult to collect because immigrants may have a reason to provide false statements  if they reply that they are an illegal immigrant  they can be deported  for instance   The verification of the data is troublesome because it requires matching INS records with individuals who often lack documentation or present false documents  54  Noncitizens may have had fewer years residing in the United States than citizens  and thus less time in which to commit crimes and be apprehended  54  In 1999  law enforcement activities involving illegal immigrants in California  Arizona  New Mexico  and Texas cost a combined total of more than  108 million  This cost did not include activities related to border enforcement  In San Diego County  the expense  over  50 million  was nine percent of the total county s budget for law enforcement that year  124  A study published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas has found that while property related crime rates have not been affected by increased immigration  both legal and illegal   in border counties there is a significant positive correlation between illegal immigration and violent crime  most likely due to extensive smuggling activity along the border  125  On August 6  2008  an audit done by agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement found that 122 of the 637 jail inmates in the Lake County  Illinois jail were of questionable immigration status  Of those 122 originally suspected  75 were later ordered to face deportation proceedings by the ICE  According to Lake County sheriff Mark Curran  illegal immigrants were charged with half of the 14 murders in the county  126  The Arizona Department of Corrections reported in 2010 that illegal immigrants are over represented in the state s prison population  In June 2010  illegal immigrants represented 14 8 percent of Arizona state prisoners  but accounted for 7 percent of the state s overall population according to the Department of Homeland Security  In addition  the data showed that the undocumented accounted for 40  of all the prisoners serving time in Arizona state prisons for kidnapping  24  of those serving time for drug charges  and 13 percent of those serving time for murder  127  A US Justice Department report from 2009 indicated that one of the largest street gangs in the United States  Los Angeles based 18th Street gang  has a membership of some 30 000 to 50 000 with 80  of them being illegal aliens from Mexico and Central America  Active in 44 cities in 20 states  its main source of income is street level distribution of cocaine and marijuana and  to a lesser extent  heroin and methamphetamine  Gang members also commit assault  auto theft  carjacking  drive by shootings  extortion  homicide  identification fraud  and robbery  128  Another prominent street gang  Mara Salvatrucha  also known as MS 13  with a membership of some 8 000 to 10 000 members in the US  is estimated to be predominantly composed of illegal immigrants  with some reporting up to 90    129  130  MS 13 members smuggle illicit drugs  primarily powder cocaine and marijuana  into the US and transport and distribute the drugs throughout the country  Some members also are involved in alien smuggling  assault  drive by shootings  homicide  identity theft  prostitution operations  robbery  and weapons trafficking  128  With over 3 000 members in Northern Virginia alone making it the largest gang in the region  131  MS 13 has been targeted by the Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force which reports that 40  of arrests from 2003 2008 were of illegal aliens  130  132  It is also reported that 71  of the U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE  gang arrestees under  Operation Community Shield  in Northern Virginia from February 2005 to September 2007  were of EWI  Enter Without Inspection  status  130   edit  Identity theft Identity theft is sometimes committed by illegal immigrants who use social security numbers belonging to others  in order to obtain fake work documentation  133  However  the US Supreme Court has ruled that undocumented immigrants cannot be prosecuted for identity theft if they use  made up  social security numbers that they do not know belong to someone else  to be guilty of identity theft with regard to social security numbers  they must know that the social security numbers that they use belong to others  134   edit  Drug trafficking According to proceedings from a 1997 meeting of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims   Through other violations of our immigration laws  Mexican drug cartels are able to extend their command and control into the United States  Drug smuggling fosters  subsidizes  and is dependent upon continued illegal immigration and alien smuggling   135  Drug cartels have been reported using illegal immigrants  sometimes armed  to cultivate marijuana within American National Forests  in California s Los Padres National Forest  136  137 Tahoe National Forest  138 Six Rivers National Forest  139  and Sequoia National Forest  140  as well as in Arizona  141  Oregon  142  and Colorado  143   edit  Gang violence See also  2010 Tamaulipas massacre and Los Zetas As of 2005  Operation Community Shield had detained nearly fourteen hundred illegal immigrant gang members  144  Members from the Salvadoran gang MS 13 are believed by authorities to have established a smuggling ring in Matamoros  Mexico  This smuggling involved transporting illegal aliens from foreign countries into the United States  MS 13 has shown extreme violence against Border Patrol security to  teach them a lesson   145   Mexican alien smugglers plan to pay violent gang members and smuggle them into the United States to murder Border Patrol agents  according to a confidential Department of Homeland Security memo obtained by the Daily Bulletin   146   edit  Environment Waves of illegal immigrants are taking a heavy toll on U S  public lands along the Mexican border  federal officials say  147  Mike Coffeen  a biologist with the Fish and Wildlife Service in Tucson  Arizona found the level of impact to be shocking  147   Environmental degradation has become among the migration trend s most visible consequences  a few years ago  there were 45 abandoned cars on the Buenos Aires refuge near Sasabe  Arizona and enough trash that a volunteer couple filled 723 large bags with 18 000 pounds of garbage over two months in 2002   148   It has been estimated that the average desert walking immigrant leaves behind 8 pounds of trash during a journey that lasts one to three days if no major incidents occur  Assuming half a million people cross the border illegally into Arizona annually  that translates to 2 000 tons of trash that migrants dump each year   149  Illegal immigrants trying to get to the United States via the Mexican border with southern Arizona are suspected of having caused eight major wildfires in 2002  The fires destroyed 68 413 acres  276 86 km2  and cost taxpayers  5 1 million to fight  150   edit  National security and terrorism Mohamed Atta and two of his co conspirators had expired visas when they executed the September 11 attacks  All of the attackers had U S  government issued documents and two of them were erroneously granted visa extensions after their deaths  151  The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States found that the government inadequately tracked those with expired tourist or student visas  Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies  a think tank that promotes immigration reduction  testified in a hearing before the House of Representatives that  out of the 48 al Qaeda operatives who committed crimes here between 1993 and 2001  12 of them were illegal aliens when they committed their crimes  seven of them were visa overstayers  including two of the conspirators in the first World Trade Center attack  one of the figures from the New York subway bomb plot  and four of the 9 11 terrorists  In fact  even a couple other terrorists who were not illegal when they committed their crimes had been visa overstayers earlier and had either applied for asylum or finagled a fake marriage to launder their status   152  Vice Chair Lee H  Hamilton and Commissioner Slade Gorton of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States has stated that of the nineteen hijackers of the September 11  2001 attacks   Two hijackers could have been denied admission at the port on entry based on violations of immigration rules governing terms of admission  Three hijackers violated the immigration laws after entry  one by failing to enroll in school as declared  and two by overstays of their terms of admission   153  Six months after the attack  their flight schools received posthumous visa approval letters from the Immigration and Naturalization Service  INS  for two of the hijackers  which made it clear that actual approval of the visas took place before the September 11 attacks  154  Since the attacks of September 11  2001  illegal immigrants within the United States have attempted to carry out other terrorist attacks as well  Three of the six conspirators in the 2007 Fort Dix attack plot  Dritan Duka  Shain Duka  and Eljvir Duka were ethnic Albanians from the Republic of Macedonia who entered the United States illegally through Mexico with their parents in 1984  Hosam Maher Husein Smadi  an illegal immigrant from Jordan who remained in the United States after the expiration of his tourist visa  was arrested in September 2009 for attempting to carry out a car bomb attack against Fountain Place in Dallas   edit  Harm to illegal immigrants There are significant dangers associated with illegal immigration including potential death when crossing the border  Since the implementation of Operation Gatekeeper immigrants have been funneled into more dangerous routes to get into the country  155  Most deaths are due to dehydration caused by the intense heats of the Arizona desert and the treacherous desert roads  Deaths also occur while resisting arrest  In May 2010  the National Human Rights Commission in Mexico accused Border Patrol agents of tasering illegal immigrant Anastasio Hern ndez Rojas to death  Media reports that Hern ndez Rojas started a physical altercation with patrol agents and later autopsy findings concluded that the suspect had elevated methampehatine blood levels which contributed to his death  The foreign ministry in Mexico City has demanded an explanation from San Diego and federal authorities  according to Tijuana newspapers  156  According to the US Border Agency  there were 987 assaults on US Border Agents in 2008 and there were a total of 12 people killed by agents in 2007 and 2008  157  Furthermore  Amnesty International has taken concern regarding the excessive brutality inflicted upon illegal immigrants  158  The organization states that its main concerns are  Numerous evidence and reports detailing cruel and excessive force by Immigration and Naturalization Service  INS  in which victims were  subjected to cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment  including beatings  sexual assault  denial of medical attention  and denial of food  water and warmth for long periods  Lack of legal representation and advice when brought to court  especially illegal immigrant children who are given no rights to a lawyer The rapid branching of INS to increase security around border patrol but no such increase in the Office of the Inspector General  which conducts investigations of complaints   edit  Slavery Indian  Russian  Thai  and Chinese women have been reportedly brought to the United States under false pretenses   As many as 50 000 people are illicitly trafficked into the United States annually  according to a 1999 CIA study  Once here  they re forced to work as prostitutes  sweatshop laborers  farmhands  and servants in private homes   US authorities call it  a modern form of slavery   159  160   edit  Prostitution The Coalition Against Trafficking in Women has reported scores of cases where women were forced to prostitute themselves   Trafficking in women plagues the United States as much as it does underdeveloped nations  Organized prostitution networks have migrated from metropolitan areas to small cities and suburbs  Women trafficked to the United States have been forced to have sex with 400 500 men to pay off  40 000 in debt for their passage    161  At least 45 000 Central American children attempt to illegally immigrate to the United States every year and many of them finish in brothels as sex slaves  according to Manuel Capellin  director in Honduras of the humanitarian organization House Alliance  162   edit  Death See also  Haitian diaspora Deaths Death by exposure has been reported in the deserts  particularly during the hot summer season  163   Exposure to the elements  encompasses hypothermia  dehydration  heat strokes  drowning  and suffocation  Also  illegal immigrants may die or be injured when they attempt to avoid law enforcement  Martinez points out that engaging in high speed pursuits while attempting to escape arrest can lead to death  164  Many migrants are also killed or maimed riding the roofs of cargo trains in Mexico  165   edit  Cultural Harvard political scientist and historian Samuel P  Huntington argues in Who Are We  The Challenges to America s National Identity that illegal immigration  primarily from Mexico  threatens to divide the United States culturally  into an Anglo Protestant north  central  and eastern portion  and a Catholic Hispanic southwest   edit  Public opinion and controversy  edit  US economy One of the most important factors regarding public opinion about illegal migration is the level of unemployment  anti immigrant sentiment is highest where unemployment is highest and vice versa  166  In July 2010  Mayor Bloomberg along with Rupert Murdoch announced the launching of the Partnership for a New American Economy to try to change public opinion and federal legislation in order to ease the cause for comprehensive immigration reform including amnesty for all illegal migrants in the U S  167  Amnesty for illegal aliens has been offered in the past  The 1940 Alien Registry Act offered amnesty for illegal aliens in the country  According to a US Justice Department report  the majority of aliens who received amnesty under that act were European  168  A May 2006 New York Times CBS News Poll shows that 53 percent of Americans feel that  illegal immigrants mostly take the jobs Americans don t want   169   edit  Crime The highly publicized murder of Arizona rancher Rob Krentz in March 2010  suspected to have been committed by an illegal immigrant  170  provided a strong rallying cry for immigration opponents and called public attention to other crimes  notably property crimes  committed by foreign nationals during their border crossings into the U S  Krentz had previously reported that illegal immigrants had done over  8 million dollars in damage to his ranching operations during a five year period  171  and in the wake of his murder  interviews with his family and friends focused on similar crimes and break ins committed by immigrants  172  The potency of anti immigrant public sentiments generated by the murder was demonstrated a few weeks later  when Arizona responded by passing Arizona SB1070  the nation s toughest state immigration law  173  While the law s writers have defended Arizona s new illegal immigration law by opining that it is necessary to fight violent crime  Though admitting an increase in border related violence  such as home invasions and kidnappings  Phoenix Police Chief Jack Harris stated his disagreement with the law  arguing that it will distort police priorities  174  175 Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu  in an interview on Horizon  said it is  absolutely appropriate  for law enforcement officers to question people about their immigration status during a routine stop or investigation  176  The law sparked protests in Arizona and elsewhere  as well as led to the boycott of Arizona by cities and communities nationwide  177  A 2008 report by the non partisan Public Policy Institute of California analyzes crime and immigration in California  Since most criminals are young adults  the study considered the proportion of foreign born young adults in the general population compared to those in the prison population  The researchers found that  while foreign born young adults represented about 35  of California s population  they only represented about 17  of the prison population  The study concludes that  immigrants are underrepresented in California prisons compared to their representation in the overall population   178  Such findings suggest that immigrants are less likely to be involved in criminal activity than non immigrants   edit  Enforcement 71  of respondents in a 2006 Quinnipiac University Poll believed that enforcement of immigration laws will require additional measures beyond a border fence  with 65  of respondents supporting employer fines  179  77  of respondents to a Los Angeles Times Bloomberg Poll support employer fines  180  181  A later NBC Wall Street Journal poll indicates 57  strongly favor employer fines and 17  somewhat favor them  while 44  strongly favor increased border security and 19  strongly oppose  182  In a CBS News New York Times poll  69  of Americans favor prosecuting and deporting illegal immigrants  33  favor deporting those who have lived and worked in the U S  for at least two years  183  184  The Manhattan Institute reported that 78  of likely Republican voters favor a proposal combining increased border security  tougher penalties for employers who hire illegal workers  and allowing illegal aliens to register for a temporary worker program that includes a path to citizenship  Respondents favored the program over a deportation and enforcement only plan 58  to 33   185  The Quinnipiac poll reports that 65  of adults support a guest worker program for illegal immigrants  181  Following the passage of Arizona s Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act in April  2010  which authorizes police officials to question persons on their immigration status if there is reasonable suspicion that they are illegally in the country or committing other violations not related to their immigration status  numerous polls showed widespread support for the law  A Rasmussen poll found that 60  of the electorate support such a law while 31  are opposed to such a law  186  A New York Times poll showed similar results  51  of Americans felt the law was  about right  in its dealings with illegal immigration  9  felt that its measures did not go far enough to address the problem while 36  have negative opinions regarding such a law  187   edit  Response of government An ABC News Poll  188  indicates that most respondents  67   believe the United States is not doing enough to keep illegal immigrants from coming into the country and  according to a CBS News New York Times poll 183  most Americans believe that US immigration policy needs either fundamental changes  41   or to be completely rebuilt  49    In an opinion poll by Zogby International in 2005  voters were also asked   Do you support or oppose the Bush administration s proposal to give millions of illegal aliens guest worker status and the opportunity to become citizens   35  gave their support  56 percent disagreed  The same poll noted a huge majority  81   believes local and state police should help federal authorities enforce laws against illegal immigration  citation needed   edit  Federal response In choosing a presidential candidate  most respondents to a Los Angeles Times Bloomberg Poll 189  consider his or her stand on illegal immigration to be either an important  66   or the most important  15   issue  while a clear minority consider it to be either not too important  16   or not important at all  2    Most respondents  51   would be upset if Congress does not pass an immigration bill while significantly fewer  22   would be pleased  A Chicago Tribune Super Tuesday exit poll shows that  Experts following the immigration debate claim Republicans had hoped illegal immigration would become a wedge issue between the two parties in the 2008 presidential election   The report adds   Voters across the country overwhelmingly and consistently have named the economy as their number one issue  in exit poll data from Super Tuesday and subsequent primaries      edit  State and local response According to a CNN Opinion Research Corporation Poll  190  most respondents  55   believe state or local police forces should arrest illegal immigrants they encounter who have not broken any state or local laws  The previously cited CNN Opinion Research Corporation Poll poll indicates that most respondents  76   are against state governments issuing driver s licenses to illegal immigrants  A poll by the Field Institute found that   California  residents are very much opposed  62  to 35   to granting illegal immigrants who do not have legal status in this country the right to obtain a California driver s license  However  opinion is more divided  49  to 48   about a plan to issue a different kind of driver s license that would allow these immigrants to drive but would also identify them as not having legal status   191  192  Further  most respondents  63   in the above mentioned 2006 Quinnipiac University Poll 179  support local laws passed by communities to fine businesses that hire illegal immigrants while 33  oppose it   edit  Film How Democracy Works Now  Twelve Stories is a 12 part documentary film series that examines the American political system through the lens of immigration reform from 2001 2007  from filmmaking team Shari Robertson and Michael Camerini  Several films in the series contain a large focus on the issue of illegal immigration in the U S  and feature advocates from both sides of the debate  Since the debut of the first five films  the series has become an important resource for advocates  policy makers and educators  193  The series premiered on HBO with the broadcast debut of The Senator s Bargain on March 24  2010  A directors  cut of The Senators  Bargain was featured in the 2010 Human Rights Watch Film Festival at Lincoln Center  with the theatrical title Story 12  Last Best Chance  That film featured Ted Kennedy s efforts to pass The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007  The second story in the 12 part series  Mountains and Clouds  opened the festival in the same year  The films document the attempt to pass comprehensive immigration reform during the years from 2001 2007  and present a behind the scenes story of the success  and failure  of many bills from that period with an effect on illegal immigration including  The DREAM Act REAL ID Act Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act Marking Up The Dream  Story Six in the How Democracy Works Now series  focuses on the heated 2003 markup in The Senate Judiciary Committee  contrasting optimistic supporters who viewed The DREAM Act as a small bi partisan bill that would help kids with the bill s opponents  who saw the legislation as thinly veiled  amnesty for illegals
