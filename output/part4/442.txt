Creation and inspiration Main articles  James Bond  character  and Inspirations for James Bond As the central figure for his works  Ian Fleming created the fictional character of James Bond  an intelligence officer in the Secret Intelligence Service  commonly known as MI6  Bond was also known by his code number  007  and was a Royal Naval Reserve Commander  Name Fleming took the name for his character from that of the American ornithologist James Bond  a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies  Fleming  a keen birdwatcher himself  had a copy of Bond s guide and he later explained to the ornithologist s wife that  It struck me that this brief  unromantic  Anglo Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed  and so a second James Bond was born   1  He further explained that  When I wrote the first one in 1953  I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull  uninteresting man to whom things happened  I wanted him to be a blunt instrument   when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God   James Bond  is the dullest name I ever heard   Ian Fleming  The New Yorker  21 April 1962 2  On another occasion Fleming said   I wanted the simplest  dullest  plainest sounding name I could find   James Bond  was much better than something more interesting  like  Peregrine Carruthers   Exotic things would happen to and around him  but he would be a neutral figure an anonymous  blunt instrument wielded by a government department   3  Inspiration Fleming based his fictional creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II  admitting that Bond  was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war   4  Amongst those types were his brother  Peter  who had been involved in behind the lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war  5  Aside from Fleming s brother  a number of others also provided some aspects of Bond s make up  including Conrad O Brien ffrench  Patrick Dalzel Job and Bill  Biffy  Dunderdale  4  Hoagy Carmichael Fleming s view of James Bond  Tastes Fleming also endowed Bond with many of his own traits  including sharing the same golf handicap  the taste for scrambled eggs and using the same brand of toiletries  6  Bond s tastes are also often taken from Fleming s own as was his behaviour  7  with Bond s love of golf and gambling mirroring Fleming s own  Fleming used his experiences of his espionage career and all other aspects of his life as inspiration when writing  including using names of school friends  acquaintances  relatives and lovers throughout his books  4  Looks Fleming decided Bond should look a little like both the American singer Hoagy Carmichael and himself 8  and in Casino Royale  Vesper Lynd remarks   Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael  but there is something cold and ruthless   Likewise  in Moonraker  Special Branch Officer Gala Brand thinks that Bond is  certainly good looking  Rather like Hoagy Carmichael in a way  That black hair falling down over the right eyebrow  Much the same bones  But there was something a bit cruel in the mouth  and the eyes were cold   8  Background It was not until the penultimate novel  You Only Live Twice  that Fleming gave Bond a sense of family background  The book was the first to be written after the release of Dr  No in cinemas and Sean Connery s depiction of Bond affected Fleming s interpretation of the character  to give Bond both a sense of humour and Scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories  9  In a fictional obituary  purportedly published in The Times  Bond s parents were given as Andrew Bond  from the village of Glencoe  Scotland  and Monique Delacroix  from Yverdon  Switzerland  10  Fleming did not provide Bond s date of birth  but John Pearson s fictional biography of Bond  James Bond  The Authorised Biography of 007  gives Bond a birth date on 11 November 1920  11  whilst a study by John Griswold puts the date at 11 November 1921  12  Novels and related works Main article  List of James Bond novels and

Bond comic books John McLusky s rendition of James Bond  In 1957  the Daily Express approached Ian Fleming to adapt his stories into comic strips  offering him  1 500 per novel and a share of takings from syndication  97  After initial reluctance  Fleming  who felt the strips would lack the quality of his writing  agreed  98  To aid the Daily Express in illustrating Bond  Fleming commissioned an artist to create a sketch of how he believed James Bond looked  The illustrator  John McLusky  however  felt that Fleming s 007 looked too  outdated  and  pre war  and changed Bond to give him a more masculine look  99  The first strip  Casino Royale was published from 7 July 1958 to 13 December 1958 100  and was written by Anthony Hern and illustrated by John McLusky  101  Most of the Bond novels

James Bond Theme  was written by Monty Norman and was first orchestrated by the John Barry Orchestra for 1962 s Dr  No  although the actual authorship of the music has been a matter of controversy for many years  121  In 2001  Norman won  30 000 in libel damages from the The Sunday Times newspaper  which suggested that Barry was entirely responsible for the composition  122  The theme  as written by Norman and arranged by Barry  was described by another Bond film composer  David Arnold  as  bebop swing vibe coupled with that vicious  dark  distorted electric guitar  definitely an instrument of rock  n  roll   it represented everything about the character you would want  It was cocky  swaggering  confident  dark  dangerous  suggestive  sexy  unstoppable  And he did it in two minutes   120  Barry composed the scores for eleven Bond films 123  and had an uncredited contribution to Dr  No with his arrangement of the Bond Theme  120  A Bond film staple are the theme songs heard during their title sequences sung by well known popular singers  124  Several of the songs produced for the films have been nominated for Academy Awards for Original Song  including Paul McCartney s  Live and Let Die   125 Carly Simon s  Nobody Does It Better  126  and Sheena Easton s  For Your Eyes Only   127  For the non Eon produced Casino Royale  Burt Bacharach s score included  The Look Of Love   which

articles  List of James Bond firearms  List of James Bond vehicles  and List of James Bond gadgets The Walther PPK is the most famous of Bond s handguns Guns For the first five novels  Fleming armed Bond with a Beretta 418 143  until he received a letter from a thirty one year old Bond enthusiast and gun expert  Geoffrey Boothroyd  criticising Fleming s choice of firearm for Bond  144  calling it  a lady s gun   and not a very nice lady at that   145  Boothroyd suggested that Bond should swap his Beretta for a Walther PPK 7 65mm and this exchange of arms made it to Dr  No  146  Boothroyd also gave Fleming advice on the Berns Martin triple draw shoulder holster and a number of the weapons used by SMERSH and other villains  147  In thanks  Fleming gave the MI6 Armourer in his novels the name Major Boothroyd and  in Dr  No  M introduces him to Bond as  the greatest small arms expert in the world   146  Bond also used a variety of rifles  including the Savage Model 99 in  For Your Eyes Only  and a Winchester  308 target rifle in  The Living Daylights   143  Other handguns used by Bond in the Fleming books included the Colt Detective Special and a long barrelled Colt  45 Army Special  143  The first Bond film  Dr  No  saw M ordering Bond to leave his Beretta behind and take up the Walther PPK  148  which the film Bond used in eighteen films  149  Since Tomorrow Never Dies  Bond s main weapon has been the Walther P99 semi automatic pistol  149  An Aston Martin DB5 as seen in Goldfinger  Vehicles In the early Bond stories Fleming gave Bond a battleship grey Bentley 4  Litre with an Amherst Villiers supercharger  150  After Bond s car was written off by Hugo Drax in Moonraker  Fleming gave Bond a Mark II Continental Bentley  which he used in the remaining books of the series  151  During Goldfinger  Bond was issued with an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device  which he used to track Goldfinger across France  Bond returned to his Bentley for the subsequent novels  151  The Bond of the films has driven a number of cars  including the Aston Martin V8 Vantage 152   during the 1980s   the V12 Vanquish 152  and DBS 153  during the 2000s  as well as the Lotus Esprit  154  the BMW Z3  155 BMW 750iL 155  and the BMW Z8  155  He has  however  also needed to drive a number of other vehicles  ranging from a Citro n 2CV to a Routemaster Bus  amongst others  156  Bond s most famous car is the silver grey Aston Martin DB5  first seen in Goldfinger  157  it later featured in Thunderball  GoldenEye  Tomorrow Never Dies and Casino Royale  158  The films have used a number of different Aston Martins for filming and publicity  one of which was sold in January 2006 at an auction in the US for  2 090 000 to an unnamed European collector  159  Gadgets The Little Nellie autogyro with its creator and pilot  Ken Wallis Fleming s novels and early screen adaptations presented minimal equipment such as the booby trapped attach  case in From Russia with Love  although this situation changed dramatically with the films  160  However  the effects of the two Eon produced Bond films Dr  No and From Russia with Love had an effect on the novel The Man with the Golden Gun  through the increased number of devices used in Fleming s final story  161  For the film adaptations of Bond  the pre mission briefing by Q Branch became one of the motifs that ran through the series  162 Dr  No provided no spy related gadgets  but a Geiger counter was used  industrial designer Andy Davey observed that the first ever onscreen spy gadget was the attach  case shown in From Russia with Love  which he described as  a classic 007 product   163  The gadgets assumed a higher profile in the 1964 film Goldfinger  The film s success encouraged further espionage equipment from Q Branch to be supplied to Bond  although the increased use of technology led to an accusation that Bond was over reliant on equipment  particularly in the later films  164  If it hadn t been for Q Branch  you d have been dead long ago  Q  to Bond Licence to Kill Davey noted that  Bond s gizmos follow the zeitgeist more closely than any other   nuance in the films  163  as they moved from the potential representations of the future in the early films  through to the brand name obsessions of the later films  163  It is also noticeable that  although Bond uses a number of pieces of equipment from Q Branch  including the Little Nellie autogyro  165  a jet pack 166  and the exploding attach  case  167  the villains are also well equipped with custom made devices  163  including Scaramanga s golden gun  168  Rosa Klebb s poison tipped shoes  169  Oddjob s steel rimmed bowler hat 170  and Blofeld s communication and bacteriological warfare agents vanity case  163  Cultural impact See also  James Bond parodies Cinematically James Bond has been a major influence within the spy genre since the release of Dr  No in 1962  171  The first parody was the 1964 film Carry on Spying showing the villain Dr  Crow being overcome by agents who included James Bind  Charles Hawtry  and Daphne Honeybutt  Barbara Windsor   172  One of the films that reacted against the portrayal of Bond was the Harry Palmer series  whose first film  The Ipcress File was released in 1965  The eponymous hero of the series was what academic Jeremy Packer called an  anti Bond   173  or what Christoph Lindner calls  the thinking man s Bond   174  The Palmer series were produced by Harry Saltzman  who also used key crew members from the Bond franchise  including designer Ken Adam  editor Peter R  Hunt and composer John Barry  175  In 1966 there were twenty two secret agent films released attempting to capitalise on the popularity and success of Bond  176  The four  Matt Helm  films starring Dean Martin were released between 1966 and 1969  177  the  Flint  series starring James Coburn provided two films in 1966 and 1969  178  whilst The Man from U N C L E  also moved onto the cinema screen  with eight films released  all were testaments to Bond s prominence in popular culture  123  More recently  the Austin Powers series by writer  producer and comedian Mike Myers 179  and other parodies such as the 2003 film Johnny English 180  have also used elements from or parodied the Bond films  Following the release of the film Dr  No in 1962  the quote  Bond     James Bond   became a catch phrase that entered the lexicon of Western popular culture  writers Cork and Scivally said of the introduction in Dr  No that the  signature introduction would become the most famous and loved film line ever   181  In 2001 it was voted as the  best loved one liner in cinema  by British cinema goers 182  and in 2005  it was honoured as the 22nd greatest quotation in cinema history by the American Film Institute as part of their 100 Years Series  183  The 2005 American Film Institute s  100 Years  series also recognised the character of James Bond himself in the film as the third greatest film hero  184  He was also placed at number eleven on a similar list by Empire  185 Premiere also listed Bond as the fifth greatest movie character of all time  186  The twenty two James Bond films produced by Eon Productions  which have grossed  4 910 000 000 in box office returns alone  187  have made the series one of the highest grossing ever  It is estimated that since Dr  No  a quarter of the world s population have seen at least one Bond film  188  The UK Film Distributors  Association have stated that the importance of the Bond series of films to the British film industry cannot be overstated  as they  form the backbone of the industry   189  Television also saw the effect of Bond films  with the NBC series The Man from U N C L E   190  which was described as the  first network television imitation  of Bond  191  largely because Fleming provided advice and ideas on the development of the series  even giving the main character the name Napoleon Solo  192  Other 1960s television imitations of Bond included I Spy  178  and Get Smart  193  See also James Bond portal Main article  Outline of James Bond Shaken  not stirred Sir Fitzroy MacLean  1st Baronet The Battle for Bond 9007
