an advertisement campaign against censorship  asserting First Amendment rights  WaldenBooks  American Booksellers Association  the Council for Periodical Distributors Association  the International Periodical Distributors Association  and Duval Bibb Services launched a lawsuit against the AFA in October 1989  under the Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act  RICO  and the

Leaders for Responsible Television  CLeaR TV   affiliated with the AFA  has approached sponsors of programs that it considered immoral  In 1989  CLeaR TV successfully persuaded General Mills  Ralston Purina  Domino s Pizza  Mazda  and Noxell to withdraw advertising from Saturday Night Live  28  AFA also boycotted PepsiCo that year also for supporting Madonna  whose video for  Like a Prayer  Wildmon felt was sacrilegious  29  During the summer of 1993 the AFA purchased full page ads in The New York Times  USA Today  and Los Angeles Times denouncing the sexual and violent content of the upcoming ABC police drama NYPD Blue  30  It also urged ABC affiliates not to broadcast the program and citizens to boycott sponsors of Blue  About a quarter of the 225 existing ABC stations followed suit  but such affiliates were mostly in rural areas of the US  The AFA campaign increased hype for the show in larger American media markets  and Blue became one of the most popular shows of the 1993 1994 television season  31  In 1996  the AFA launched a boycott against Walt Disney Company when the company began giving benefits to same sex employees in domestic partnerships  The AFA has claimed that Michael Eisner  the CEO of The Disney Company   was involved in a media group that actively promoted the homosexual agenda  and was pushing the  gay agenda   The AFA ended the unsuccessful nine year boycott in spring 2005 after Eisner left the company  32  33  34  Tim Wildmon stated  We feel after nine years of boycotting Disney we have made our point   35  In 2003  the AFA  with the American Decency Association  Focus on the Family  and Citizens for Community Values  lobbied and boycotted Abercrombie  amp  Fitch  calling on  A amp F to stop using blatant pornography in its quarterly catalog   36  In December 2003  the company  recalled the holiday catalog from all its stores  saying it needed the space on the counter for a new perfume  and stated it would stop printing

 a pro abortion  pro lesbian advocacy group   38  In Spring 2005 the AFA launched a boycott of Ford for advertising in gay magazines  donating to gay rights organizations  and sponsoring gay pride celebrations  32  39  40  After meeting with representatives of the group  Ford announced it was curtailing ads in a number of major gay publications  due not by cultural but by  cost cutting  factors  That statement was contradicted by the AFA  which claimed it had a  good faith agreement  that Ford would cease such ads  Soon afterwards  as a result of a strong outcry from the gay community  Ford backtracked and announced it would continue ads in gay publications  in response to which the AFA denounced Ford for  violating  the agreement  and renewed threats of a boycott  41  The boycott ended in March 2008  42  On Independence Day 2008  the AFA announced a boycott of McDonald s  43  which had a director on the board of the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce  In October 2008  AFA

franchisees  44  On August 25  2008  the AFA announced their boycott of Hallmark Cards for their decision to start selling same sex wedding cards  45  In December 2008  the AFA issued an  Action Alert  46  which called for members to protest about the Campbell Soup Company  which had purchased two 2 page advertisements in the December 2008 and January 2009 issues of LGBT magazine The Advocate  The Action Alert said that Campbell s  sent a message that homosexual parents constitute a family and are worthy of support   The advertisements showed a married lesbian couple with their son  AFA spokesman Randy Sharp said  the Campbell Soup Company is saying  we approve of homosexual marriage    47  In November 2009  the AFA called for a boycott against clothing retailer The Gap  Inc   claiming the retailer s holiday television advertising campaign failed to mention Christmas   Christmas has historically been very good for commerce  But now Gap wants the commerce but no Christmas  wrote an AFA spokesperson  The Gap soon released an advertisement in response to the boycott  specifically referring to Christmas  albeit with a number of other holidays that take place at the same time of year and added the word  Christmas  to in store decor  48  49  In 2012 they led a failed boycott against Archie comics when an edition featured a same sex marriage  50   edit  Published media On April 16  2007  following the Virginia Tech Massacre  the AFA released a video titled The Day They Kicked God out of the Schools  in which God tells a student that students were killed in schools because God isn t allowed in schools anymore  The video claims that the shootings at Virginia Tech  Columbine  and many other locations  are the result of  among other things  decreased discipline in schools  no prayer in schools  sex out of wedlock  rampant violence in TV  movies  and music  or abortions  51  52  Speechless  Silencing the Christians is a 2008 documentary series hosted by Janet Parshall  The documentary series explains the AFA s position against the drive towards political correctness  and how various factors  such as hate crime laws and other discriminatory actions  are threatening the Christians  existence  In 2009  a one hour special version of the program was produced and aired on commercial television stations  where AFA purchased the air time  53   edit  Sexual morality The AFA has repeatedly lobbied Congress to eliminate funding for the National Endowment for the Arts  54  For example  in 2000  the AFA issued a press release condemning the NEA s funding of One of the Guys  a controversial book by Robert Clark Young described by a senior AFA official as  scatological   The complaint from the AFA was that the book included sexually explicit material  in particular  a description of a young woman extracting razor blades from her vagina during a performance in a sex club  In a Washington Post editorial in response to the complaint  Young stated   I find it strange that an organization that claims to uphold family values and to oppose the federal funding of obscenity is not protesting the part of the military budget that goes to support pederasty in the Far East   55  Speaking in defense of Mike Huckabee s comments on the handling of AIDS patients  the head of the AFA of Pennsylvania said Huckabee s comments were being taken out of context and that Huckabee was right that AIDS patients should have been quarantined  56   edit  View on media Wildmon has been accused of saying that he believes Hollywood and the theater world are heavily influenced by Jewish people  and that television network executives and advertisers have a genuine hostility towards Christians  57  58  59   edit  Opposition to other religions On November 28  2006  following the election of Keith Ellison  the first Muslim elected to the United States Congress  60  the AFA released an  Action Alert   The Action Alert  entitled  A first for America   The Koran replaces the Bible at swearing in oath  What book will America base its values on  the Bible or the Koran    requested subscribers write their Congressional representatives and urge them to create a  law making the Bible the book used in the swearing in ceremony of representatives and senators   61  62  63  On July 13  2007  a Hindu prayer was conducted in the U S  Senate  Rajan Zed  director of interfaith relations at a Hindu temple  read the prayer at the invitation of Senate majority leader Harry Reid  who defended his invitation based on the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi  AFA sent out an  Action Alert  to its members to email  write letters  or call their Senators to oppose the Hindu prayer  stating it is  seeking the invocation of a non monotheistic god   64  65  66  The  alert  stated that  since Hindus worship multiple gods  the prayer will be completely outside the American paradigm  flying in the face of the American motto One Nation Under God   67  The convocation by Zed was in fact disrupted by three protesters from a different Fundamentalist Christian activist group Operation Save America in the gallery reportedly shouting  this is an abomination  and that they were  Christians and Patriots   64   edit  Islam On August 10  2010  Bryan Fischer  AFA s director of Issue Analysis for Government and Public Policy  posted on his blog that  Permits should not be granted to build even one more mosque in the United States of America  let alone the monstrosity planned for Ground Zero  This is for one simple reason  each Islamic mosque is dedicated to the overthrow of the American government   This was in response to a 1991 memorandum circulated by the Muslim Brotherhood where they call for  grand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and  sabotaging  its miserable house   as well as the ongoing debate about building a mosque and Islamic community center near Ground Zero in Manhattan  Fischer continued   Because of this subversive ideology  Muslims cannot claim religious freedom protections under the First Amendment   68   edit  Homosexuality The AFA expresses public concern over what it refers to as the  homosexual agenda   They state that the Bible  declares that homosexuality is unnatural and sinful   The AFA actively lobbies against the social acceptance of homosexual behavior   We oppose the homosexual movement s efforts to convince our society that their behavior is normal    69  The AFA also actively promotes the idea that homosexuality is a choice and that sexual orientation can be changed through religious teachings in ex gay ministries  70  In 1996  responding to a complaint from an AFA member who was participating in an AFA campaign targeting gay journalists  the Fort Worth Star Telegram transferred a gay editor out of a job that occasionally required him to work with schoolchildren  The AFA targeted the editor due to cartoon strips he created  which were published in gay magazines  The paper apparently acted on the AFA s unsubstantiated statement that the editor was  preoccupied with the subjects of pedophilia and incest   71  In 2000  Vice president Tim Wildmon spoke out against gay straight alliance clubs in schools  stating   We view these kinds of clubs as an advancement of the homosexual cause   72  In 2004  the AFA raised concerns about the movie Shark Tale because the group believed the movie was designed to promote the acceptance of gay rights by children  3  73  On the October 11  2005  AFA broadcast  Tim Wildmon agreed with a caller that cable networks like Animal Planet and HGTV featured  evidence of homosexuality and lesbian people  and added that  you have to watch out for children s programs today as well because they ll slip it in there as well   74  In 2007  the AFA spoke out against IKEA for featuring gay families in their television ads  75  In June 2008  the AFA protested a Heinz television advertisement  shown in the United Kingdom  which showed two men kissing  which Heinz then withdrew  76   edit  One Million Moms One Million Dads project AFA created One Million Moms and One Million Dads  two websites with the stated goal of mobilizing parents to  stop the exploitation of children  by the media  It uses these websites to organize boycotts and urge activists to send emails to mainstream companies employing advertising  selling products  or advertising on television shows they find offensive  77  In 2012  the group started and then backed off from a failed campaign against the hiring of talk show host Ellen DeGeneres as a spokesperson for department store chain JC Penney  78  They opposed this employment on the grounds that DeGeneres is  an open homosexual   79  At a taping of her show  DeGeneres informed her audience of the fizzled effort   They wanted to get me fired and I am proud and happy to say JC Penney stuck by their decision to make me their spokesperson   80   edit  Inter group coordination The AFA s founder  Don Wildmon  was  instrumental  in initially setting up the Arlington Group  a networking vehicle for social conservatives focusing on gay marriage  10   edit  Criticism and controversy  edit  Intellectual freedom Individuals in the media industry have criticized Donald Wildmon  the founder of AFA  Gene Mater  Senior Vice President of CBS Television  has stated   We look upon Wildmon s efforts as the greatest frontal assault on intellectual freedom this country has ever faced  and Brandon Tartikoff  former NBC Entertainment President  stated that Wildmon s boycott campaign was  the first step toward a police state   81   edit  Stance on homosexuality The AFA has been criticized by a number of organizations for their stance against homosexuality  18  82  83  In 1998  the popular Internet filtering software CyberPatrol blocked the AFA s web site  classifying it under the category  intolerance   defined as  pictures or text advocating prejudice or discrimination against any race  color  national origin  religion  disability or handicap  gender or sexual orientation     AFA spokesman Steve Ensley told reporters   Basically we re being blocked for free speech   CyberPatrol cited quotes from the AFA for meeting its intolerance criteria  which included   Indifference or neutrality toward the homosexual rights movement will result in society s destruction by allowing civil order to be redefined and by plummeting ourselves  our children  and grandchildren into an age of godlessness    A national  Coming Out of Homosexuality  provides us a means whereby to dispel the lies of the homosexual rights crowd who say they are born that way and cannot change   and  We want to outlaw public homosexuality   We believe homosexuality is immoral and leads ultimately to personal and social decay   2  19  83  84  On October 19  1998  the San Francisco Board of Supervisors  led by Leslie Katz  wrote a letter to the AFA in response to an advertisement placed in the San Francisco Chronicle by the AFA regarding homosexuality and Christianity  The letter stated  85  Supervisor Leslie Katz denounces your rhetoric against gays  lesbians and transgendered people  What happened to Matthew Shepard is in part due to the message being espoused by your groups that gays and lesbians are not worthy of the most basic equal rights and treatment  It is not an exaggeration to say that there is a direct correlation between these acts of discrimination  such as when gays and lesbians are called sinful and when major religious organizations say they can change if they tried  and the horrible crimes committed against gays and lesbians  During the same time  the City and County of San Francisco passed two resolutions  Resolution No  234 99  calls for the Religious Right to take accountability for the impact of their long standing rhetoric denouncing gays and lesbians  which leads to a climate of mistrust and discrimination that can open the door to horrible crimes such as those committed against Mr  Gaither   86  and Resolution No  873 98 was specifically directed at  anti gay  television advertisements  AFA unsuccessfully challenged these actions as violating the Free Speech and Free Exercise clauses of the First Amendment in American Family Association v  City and County of San Francisco  85  In 1998  multiple organizations voiced criticism of a series of AFA sponsored full page newspaper advertisements that promoted religious ministries involved in the ex gay movement  In response to the advertisements  the Religious Leadership Roundtable said the ads employed  language of violence and hatred to denounce other people   IntegrityUSA criticized the ads  calling them  evil  disregarding Christian teachings about the  dignity of every human being   DignityUSA also criticized the advertisements  which they said were  misleading and destructive   87  In July 2000  the AFA sent out emails and letters calling for openly gay Arizona Republican United States House of Representatives member Jim Kolbe to be barred from speaking at the Republican National Convention  88  The AFA also said that Kolbe should be arrested when he returned to his home state  as because Kolbe is gay  he was violating an Arizona law that banned sodomy  89 Equality Mississippi  a statewide LGBT civil rights organization which has voiced opposition and criticism towards the AFA s activism regarding homosexuality  felt that AFA s action was constituting and encouraging violence towards the gay community  90  In 2005  Equality Mississippi publicly spoke out against the AFA for the use of copyrighted images on the AFA web site in its boycott against Kraft Foods for being a sponsor of the 2006 Gay Games in Chicago  The photographs  which were used without permission  were owned by and retrieved from ChrisGeary com  Equality Mississippi encouraged ChrisGeary com to file suit against the AFA and offered to support the suit  91  As of March 2009 update   the images were still on AFA s web site  92  The American Family Association has objected to having their comments on homosexuality described as homophobia and akin to racism or sexism  saying that their beliefs are based in religion  93  Former AFA California leader Scott Lively 18  94  is a co author of The Pink Swastika which claims that many leaders in the German Nazi regime  including Hitler himself  were gay  He has since co founded Watchmen on the Walls  In May 2010  Bryan Fischer  the AFA s director of Issue Analysis for Government and Public Policy  95  wrote a blog post on the AFA website 96  detailing allegations that Adolf Hitler was a homosexual  and concluding that gay people in the military caused the Holocaust   Nazi Germany became the horror that it was because it rejected both Christianity and its clear teaching about human sexuality  These are mistakes no sane culture should ever make again   96  In June 2008  AFA s news website  OneNewsNow   which had begun replacing all instances of  gay  with  homosexual  in re posted Associated Press articles 97    changed an AP profile of Olympic sprinter Tyson Gay  rendering his name as  Tyson Homosexual   98  99  100 OneNewsNow similarly altered the name of basketball player Rudy Gay  naming him  Rudy Homosexual   101  The gay rights website GoodAsYou org  which  has long chronicled the AFA s practice of changing AP copy to suit its conservative agenda   spotted the errors  Tyson Gay was upset with the mistake  102  103   edit  Marilyn Manson Paul Cambria  lawyer for rock band Marilyn Manson  sent a cease and desist letter to AFA on April 25  1997 in response to allegations published in the AFA Journal that Manson encouraged audience members to engage in sexual and violent acts in its concerts  AFA Journal relied on testimony by two anonymous teenage concertgoers  104  The allegations were independently proven to be false  105  Wildmon responded that his organization as a whole was not responsible  but rather the AFA s Gulf Coast chapter in Biloxi  Mississippi  106   edit  Labeled a hate group Southern Poverty Law Center  SPLC   in a 2005 report  stated that the AFA  along with other groups  engaged in hate speech to  help drive the religious right s anti gay crusade   107  Mark Potok of the SPLC determined that the turning point was 2003 s Lawrence v  Texas  in which the Supreme Court struck down Texas s anti sodomy laws  After that  the Christian right spent millions on advertisements  107  and on pastor briefings organized by activists such as born again Christian David Lane  108  Lane helped AFA put constitutional opposite sex marriage amendments on the ballots of 13 states  107  In November 2010  the SPLC changed their listing of AFA from a group that used hate speech to the more serious one of being designated a hate group  109  110  111  112  113  114  Potok said that the AFA s  propagation of known falsehoods and demonizing propaganda  was the basis for the change  115  116  The AFA was greatly displeased with the designation as a hate group  117  calling the list  slanderous   118  In response to the SPLC s announcement  some members of the Christian right  call ed  on Congress to cut off their funding   119  J  Matt Barber of The Washington Times said that the SPLC was  marginalizing  themselves by giving the AFA the same hate group designation shared by the Ku Klux Klan and neo Nazis  120  Tony Perkins  the president of Family Research Council  FRC    an organization also named a hate group   asked the SPLC to strike the new designation  but they held their position  121  Ken Williams commented that in reaction  the FRC and the AFA joined with other  pro family  organizations targeted by the SPLC to establish a new website  an online petition 122  called  Start Debating Stop Hating  to counter the SPLC  123  and they took out full page ads in two Washington D C  newspapers  defending their work  to protect and promote natural marriage and the family   124  The advertisement stated the  undersigned stand in solidarity  with the organizations designated as hate groups  and that they  support the vigorous but responsible exercise of the First Amendment rights of free speech and religious liberty that are the birthright of all Americans   123  House Speaker Designate John Boehner and the governors of Louisiana  Minnesota and Virginia were among those signing the statement  124  The SPLC addressed the new website statement  Potok was quoted by David Weigel of Slate magazine as saying   the SPLC s listings of these groups is based on their propagation of known falsehoods   claims about LGBT people that have been thoroughly discredited by scientific authorities   and repeated  groundless name calling   125  The American Independent News Network  AINN  noted that the AFA had recently denounced Supreme Court justice Elena Kagan as a lesbian unfit for office   AINN stated that  she s not  a lesbian   and that Fischer said Hitler s savage and brutal methods were only possible because he and most of his stormtroopers were gay  126  Jillian Rayfield of Talking Points Memo noted the irony in the website calling the SPLC a  radical Left  group  spreading hateful rhetoric  yet elsewhere declaring that the debates of the Christian right  can and must remain civil   but they must never be suppressed through personal assaults that aim only to malign an opponent s character   118   edit  See also American Family
