New Hampshire is part of the New England region  It is bounded by Quebec  Canada  to the north and northwest  Maine and the Atlantic Ocean to the east  Massachusetts to the south  and Vermont to the west  New Hampshire s major regions are the Great North Woods  the White Mountains  the Lakes Region  the Seacoast  the Merrimack Valley  the Monadnock Region  and the Dartmouth Lake Sunapee area  New Hampshire has the shortest ocean coastline of any U S  coastal state  with a length of 18 miles  29 km   New Hampshire was home to the rock formation called the Old Man of the Mountain  a face like profile in Franconia Notch  until the formation fell apart in May 2003  The White Mountains range in New Hampshire spans the north central portion of the state  with Mount Washington the tallest in the northeastern U S    site of the second highest wind speed ever recorded 9    and other mountains like Mount Madison and Mount Adams surrounding it  With hurricane force winds every third day on average  over 100 recorded deaths among visitors  and conspicuous krumholtz  dwarf  matted trees much like a carpet of bonsai trees   the climate on the upper reaches of Mount Washington has inspired the weather observatory on the peak to claim that the area has the  World s Worst Weather   10  During autumn  the leaves on many hardwood trees in New Hampshire turn colors  attracting many tourists  In the flatter southwest corner of New Hampshire  the landmark Mount Monadnock has given its name to a class of earth forms   a monadnock   signifying  in geomorphology  any isolated resistant peak rising from a less resistant eroded plain  Major rivers include the 110 mile  177 km  Merrimack River  which bisects the lower half of the state north south and ends up in Newburyport  Massachusetts  Its tributaries include the Contoocook River  Pemigewasset River  and Winnipesaukee River  The 410 mile  660 km  Connecticut River  which starts at New Hampshire s Connecticut Lakes and flows south to Connecticut  defines the western border with Vermont  The state border is not in the center of that river  as usually the case  but at the low water mark on the Vermont side  meaning that the entire river along the Vermont border  save for areas where the water level has been raised by a dam  lies within New Hampshire  11  Only one town   Pittsburg   shares a land border with the state of Vermont  The  northwesternmost headwaters  of the Connecticut also define the Canadian border with New Hampshire  New Hampshire  showing roads  rivers and major cities The Piscataqua River and its several tributaries form the state s only significant ocean port where they flow into the Atlantic at Portsmouth  The Salmon Falls River and the Piscataqua define the southern portion of the border with Maine  The Piscataqua River boundary was the subject of a border dispute between New Hampshire and Maine in 2001  with New Hampshire claiming dominion over several islands  primarily Seavey s Island  that include the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard  The U S  Supreme Court dismissed the case in 2002  leaving ownership of the island with Maine  The largest of New Hampshire s lakes is Lake Winnipesaukee  which covers 71 square miles  184 km2  in the east central part of New Hampshire  Lake Umbagog along the Maine border  approximately 12 3 square miles  31 9 km2   is a distant second  Hampton Beach is a popular local summer destination  About 7 miles  11 km  offshore are the Isles of Shoals  nine small islands  four of which are in New Hampshire  known as the site of a 19th century art colony founded by poet Celia Thaxter  as well as the alleged location of one of the buried treasures of the pirate Blackbeard  It is the state with the second highest percentage of timberland area in the country  after Maine  12  New Hampshire has the shortest ocean coastline of any state in the United States  approximately 18 miles long  13  New Hampshire is in the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome  Much of the state  in particular the White Mountains  is covered by the conifers and northern hardwoods of the New England Acadian forests  The southeast corner of the state and parts of the Connecticut River along the Vermont border are covered by the mixed oaks of the Northeastern coastal forests  14  The northern third of the state is locally referred to as the  north country  or  north of the notches   in reference to White Mountain passes that channel traffic  It contains less than 5  of the state s population  suffers relatively high poverty  and is losing population as the logging and paper industries decline  However  the tourist industry  in particular visitors who go to northern New Hampshire to ski  snowboard  hike and mountain bike has helped offset economic losses from mill closures   edit  Climate New Hampshire experiences a humid continental climate  Koppen climate classification Dfa in southern areas and Dfb in the north   with warm  humid summers  cold  wet winters  and uniform precipitation all year  The climate of the southeastern portion is moderated by the Atlantic Ocean and averages relatively milder and wetter weather  while the northern and interior portions experience cooler temperatures and lower humidity  Winters are cold and snowy throughout the state  and especially severe in the northern and mountainous areas  Average annual snowfall ranges from 60 inches  150 cm  to over 100 inches  250 cm  across the state  15  Average daytime highs are in the mid 70s F to low 80s F  around 24 28  C  throughout the state in July  with overnight lows in the mid 50s F to low 60s F  13 15  C   January temperatures range from an average high of 34  F  1  C  on the coast to overnight lows below 0  F   18  C  in the far north and at high elevations  Average annual precipitation statewide is roughly 40 inches  100 cm  with some variation occurring in the White Mountains due to differences in elevation and annual snowfall  New Hampshire s highest recorded temperature was 106  F  41  C  in Nashua on July 4  1911  while the lowest recorded temperature was  47  F   44  C  atop Mount Washington on January 29  1934  Mount Washington also saw an unofficial  50  F   46  C  reading on January 22  1885 which  if made official  would tie the all time record low for New England  also  50  F   46  C  at Big Black River  Maine on January 16  2009 and Bloomfield  Vermont on December 30  1933   Extreme snow is often associated with a nor easter  such as the Blizzard of  78 and the Blizzard of 1993  when several feet accumulated across portions of the state over 24 to 48 hours  Lighter snowfalls of several inches occur frequently throughout winter  often associated with an Alberta Clipper  New Hampshire  on occasion  is affected by hurricanes and tropical storms although by the time they reach the state they are often extratropical  with most storms striking the southern New England coastline and moving inland or passing by offshore in the Gulf of Maine  Most of New Hampshire averages fewer than 20 days of thunderstorms per year and an average of two tornadoes occur annually statewide  16  The National Arbor Day Foundation plant hardiness zone map depicts zones 3  4  5  and 6 occurring throughout the state 17  and indicates the transition from a relatively cooler to warmer climate as one travels southward across New Hampshire  The 1990 USDA plant hardiness zones for New Hampshire range from zone 3b in the north to zone 5b in the south  18   edit  Metropolitan areas See also  List of cities in New

Brown Company in Berlin Various Algonquian  Pennacook  tribes inhabited the area prior to European settlement  English and French explorers visited New Hampshire in 1600 1605  and English fishermen settled at Odiorne s Point in present day Rye in 1623  The first permanent settlement was at Hilton s Point  present day Dover   By 1631  the Upper Plantation comprised modern day Dover  Durham and Stratham  in 1679  it became the  Royal Province   Father Rale s War was fought between the colonists and the Wabanaki Confederacy throughout New Hampshire  New Hampshire was one of the thirteen colonies that rebelled against British rule during the American Revolution  By the time of the American Revolution  New Hampshire was a divided province  The economic and social life of the Seacoast revolved around sawmills  shipyards  merchant s warehouses  and established village and town centers  Wealthy merchants built substantial homes  furnished them with the finest luxuries  and invested their capital in trade and land speculation  At the other end of the social scale  there developed a permanent class of day laborers  mariners  indentured servants and even slaves  The only battle fought in New Hampshire was the raid on Fort William and Mary  December 14  1774  in Portsmouth Harbor  which netted the rebellion sizable quantities of gunpowder  small arms and cannon   General Sullivan  leader of the raid  described it as   remainder of the powder  the small arms  bayonets  and cartouche boxes  together with the cannon and ordnance stores   over the course of two nights  This raid was preceded by a warning to local patriots the previous day  by Paul Revere on December 13  1774  that the fort was to be reinforced by troops sailing from Boston  According to unverified accounts  the gunpowder was later used at the Battle of Bunker Hill  transported there by Major Demerit  who was one of several New Hampshire patriots who stored the powder in their homes until it was transported elsewhere for use in revolutionary activities  New Hampshire was a Jacksonian stronghold  the state sent Franklin Pierce to the White House in the election of 1852  Industrialization took the form of numerous textile mills  which in turn attracted large flows of immigrants from Quebec  the  French Canadians   and Ireland  The northern parts of the state produced lumber and the mountains provided tourist attractions  After 1960  the textile industry collapsed  but the economy rebounded as a center of high technology and a service provider  Since 1952  New Hampshire gained national and international attention for its presidential primary held early in every presidential election year  It immediately became the most important testing grounds for candidates for the Republican and Democratic nominations  The media gave New Hampshire  and Iowa  about half of all the attention paid to all states in the primary process  magnifying the state s decision powers  and spurring repeated efforts by out of state politicians to change the rules    edit  Demographics Historical populations Census Pop     1790 141 885   1800 183 858 29 6  1810 214 460 16 6  1820 244 155

Hampshire s total state product in 2008 was  60 billion  ranking 40th in the United States  31 Median household income in 2008 was  49 467  seventh highest in the country  Its agricultural outputs are dairy products  nursery stock  cattle  apples and eggs  Its industrial outputs are machinery  electric equipment  rubber and plastic products and tourism  32  New Hampshire experienced a significant shift in its economic base during the last century  Historically  the base was composed of the traditional New England manufactures of textiles  shoe making  and small machining shops drawing upon low wage labor from nearby small farms and from parts of Quebec  Today  these sectors contribute only 2  for textiles  2  for leather goods  and 9  for machining of the state s total manufacturing dollar value  Source  U S  Economic Census for 1997  Manufacturing  New Hampshire   They experienced a sharp decline due to obsolete plants and the lure of cheaper wages in the South  The state s budget in FY2008 was  5 11 billion  including  1 48 billion in federal funds  The issue of taxation is controversial in New Hampshire  which has a property tax  subject to municipal control  but no broad sales tax or income tax  The state does have narrower taxes on meals  lodging  vehicles  business and investment income  and tolls on state roads  According to the Energy Information Administration  New Hampshire s energy consumption and per capita energy consumption are among the lowest in the country  The Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant  located near Portsmouth  is the largest nuclear reactor in New England and provides about 30 percent of New Hampshire s electricity  Two natural gas fired plants and some fossil fuel powered plants  including the coal fired Merrimack Station plant in Bow  provide most of the rest  New Hampshire s residential electricity use is low compared with the national average  in part because demand for air conditioning is low during the generally mild summer months and because few households use electricity as their primary energy source for home heating  Over half of New Hampshire households use fuel oil for winter heating  New Hampshire has potential for renewable energies like wind power  hydroelectricity  and wood fuel  33  The state has no general sales tax and no personal state income tax  the state does tax  at a 5 percent rate  income from dividends and interest  and the legislature has exercised fiscal restraint  Efforts to diversify the state s general economy have been ongoing  Additionally  New Hampshire s lack of a broad based tax system  aside from the controversial statewide property tax  has resulted in the state s local communities having some of the nation s highest property taxes  Overall  New Hampshire remains ranked 49th among states in combined average state and local tax burden  34  As of February 2010  the state s unemployment rate was 7 1   35  By October 2010  the unemployment rate dropped to 5 4   36   edit

edit  Governing documents The New Hampshire State Constitution of 1783 is the supreme law of the state  followed by the New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated and the New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules  These are roughly analogous to the federal United States Constitution  United States Code and Code of Federal Regulations respectively   edit  Branches of government New Hampshire has a bifurcated executive branch  consisting of the governor and a five member executive council which votes on state contracts worth more than  5 000 and  advises and consents  to the governor s nominations to major state positions such as department heads and all judgeships and pardon requests  New Hampshire does not have a lieutenant governor  the Senate president serves as  acting governor  whenever the governor is unable to perform the duties  The legislature is called the General Court  It consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate  There are 400 representatives  making it one of the largest elected bodies in the English speaking world  38  and 24 senators  Most are effectively volunteers  nearly half of which are retirees   For details  see

provides for jury trials in civil or criminal cases  The other state courts are the Probate Court  District Court  and the Family Division   edit  Local government New Hampshire has 10 counties and 234 cities and towns  New Hampshire is a  Dillon Rule  state  meaning that the state retains all powers not specifically granted to municipalities  Even so  the legislature strongly favors local control  particularly with regard to land use regulations  New Hampshire municipalities are classified as towns or cities  which differ primarily by the form of government  Most towns generally operate on the town meeting form of government  where the registered voters in the town act as the town legislature  and a board of selectmen acts as the executive of the town  Larger towns and the state s thirteen cities operate either on a council manager or council mayor form of government  There is no difference  from the point of view of the state government  between towns and cities besides the form of government  All state level statutes treat all municipalities identically  New Hampshire has a small number of unincorporated areas that are titled as gores  grants  locations  purchases  or townships  These locations have limited to no self government  and services are generally provided for them by neighboring towns or the county or state where needed  As of the 2000 census  there were 25 of these left in New Hampshire  accounting for a total population of 175 people  as of 2000   several were entirely depopulated  All but two of these unincorporated areas are located in Coos County   edit  Politics Main articles  Politics of New Hampshire and Political party strength in New Hampshire The Republican Party and the Democratic Party are the only official parties  A plurality of voters are registered as undeclared  and can choose either ballot in the primary and then regain their undeclared status after voting  39  The Libertarian Party had official party status from 1990 to 1994   edit  New Hampshire primary Saint Anselm College has held several national debates on campus  New Hampshire is internationally famous for the New Hampshire primary  the first primary in the quadrennial American presidential election cycle  State law requires that the Secretary of State schedule this election at least one week before any  similar event   However  the Iowa caucus has preceded the New Hampshire primary  This primary  as the nation s first contest that uses the same procedure as the general election  draws more attention than those in other states  and has often been decisive in shaping the national contest  State law permits a town with fewer than 100 residents to open its polls at midnight  and close when all registered citizens have cast their ballots  As such  the communities of Dixville Notch in Coos County and Hart s Location in Carroll County  among others  have chosen to implement these provisions  Dixville Notch and Hart s Location are traditionally the first places in both New Hampshire and the U S  to vote in presidential primaries and elections  Nominations for all other partisan offices are decided in a separate primary election  In Presidential election cycles  this is the second primary election held in New Hampshire  Saint Anselm College in Goffstown has become a popular campaign spot for politicians as well as several national presidential debates because of its proximity to Manchester Boston Regional Airport  40  41  42   edit  Election results In the past  New Hampshire has often voted Republican  Between 1856 and 1988  New Hampshire cast its electoral votes for the Democratic presidential ticket six times  Woodrow Wilson  twice   Franklin D  Roosevelt  three times   and Lyndon B  Johnson  once   Beginning in 1992  New Hampshire became a swing state in both national and local elections  The state supported Democrats Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996  John Kerry in 2004  and Barack Obama in 2008  It was the only state in the country to switch from supporting Republican George W  Bush in the 2000 election to supporting his Democratic challenger in the 2004 election  when John Kerry  a senator from neighboring Massachusetts  won the state  The Democrats dominated elections in New Hampshire as they did nationally in 2006 and 2008  In 2006  Democrats won both Congressional seats  electing Carol Shea Porter in the 1st district and Paul Hodes in the 2nd district   re elected Governor John Lynch  and gained a majority on the Executive Council and in both houses of the legislature for the first time since 1911  Democrats had not held both the legislature and the governorship since 1874  43  Neither U S  Senate seat was up for a vote in 2006  In 2008  Democrats retained their majorities  governorship  and Congressional seats  and former governor Jeanne Shaheen defeated incumbent Republican John E  Sununu for the U S  Senate in a rematch of the 2002 contest  The 2008 elections

network of Interstate highways  U S  highways  and state highways  State highway markers still depict the Old Man of the Mountain despite that rock formation s demise in 2003  Several route numbers align with the same route numbers in neighboring states  State highway numbering does not indicate the highway s direction  Major routes include  Interstate 89 runs northwest from near Concord to Lebanon on the Vermont border  Interstate 93 is the main Interstate highway in New Hampshire and runs north from Salem  on the Massachusetts border  to Littleton  on the Vermont border   I 93 connects
