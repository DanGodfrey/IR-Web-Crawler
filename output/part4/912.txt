Comics editor writer Stan Lee  artist Jack Kirby and several other illustrators produced a number of superhero titles which stressed character personalities and personal conflict as much as action and adventure  including The Fantastic Four  The Incredible Hulk and Spider Man  The X Men was one of the last titles of this Silver Age renaissance  appearing in September 1963  In the comic book series  the X Men were founded by the paraplegic telepath Charles Xavier  also known as Professor X  Xavier gathered the X Men under the cover of a  School for Gifted Youngsters  at a large country estate at 1407 Graymalkin Lane in Salem Center  a city in Westchester County  New York  Cover billed as  the strangest heroes of all   the original X Men consisted of five teenagers still learning to control their powers  Cyclops  Scott Summers   whose eyes constantly gave off heatless blasts of concussive force that could only be controlled by a  ruby quartz  visor  He would become the X Men s field leader  Marvel Girl  Jean Grey  later known as Phoenix   a telekinetic of limited power  She was Xavier s first female student  Angel  Warren Worthington III  later known as Archangel   who took his name from the large  angel like feathered wings which sprouted from his back sometime during military school and allowed him to fly  Beast  Hank McCoy   a genius with remarkable physical prowess  whose enlarged hands and feet granted him enhanced agility and dexterity  Iceman  Bobby Drake   who could transform his body into ice and lower temperatures by absorbing moisture from the air  A precursor to the concept of a school for feared genetic mutants appeared in the 1953 science fiction novel Children of the Atom by Wilmar H  Shiras  which has been credited   though never officially confirmed   with inspiring the X Men  The title characters of the novel were also mutants  the results of an unintended experiment in genetic mutation  The term  Children of the Atom  has also been used at times during the X Men franchise s history  often as a subtitle for various X Men publications and video games  Despite the philosophical concepts which appeared in The X Men  Lee has said he invented genetic  mutants  to find a way to create a number of super powered characters without having to come up with a separate and interesting origin for each one  The X Men  1 also introduced the team s arch nemesis  Magneto  who controlled magnetism and who felt that mutants should rule over or kill all normal humans  Magneto s character would later be fleshed out to reveal that he once shared a friendship with Professor X  and that his decree that mutants must conquer or be conquered grew from his experiences as a Holocaust survivor  The X Men  4 introduced Magneto s team  the Brotherhood of Mutants  including Mastermind  the Toad  Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch  Other villains were also introduced during this era who would loosely become affiliated with the Brotherhood over time  including Unus the Untouchable  the Vanisher and the Blob  the latter having the most longevity with the group  joining or aiding nearly every incarnation  Xavier with the original team of X Men  Beast  Iceman  Cyclops  Angel  and Marvel Girl  Art by Jack Kirby  While a few other important villains debuted during the 1960s   such as Professor X s superhumanly strong stepbrother the Juggernaut and the mutant hunting robot Sentinels   the X Men often fought easily forgotten mutant criminals  alien invaders and brutish monsters  As a result  this era is largely regarded as unremarkable and The X Men became one of the less successful Marvel series during the 1960s  During this early era  only one other member was briefly added to the team  Mimic  Calvin Rankin   who could use the powers of others  including the other X Men  He is notable for not only having blackmailed himself onto the team  but also being the only member expelled by Xavier  Whether or not he is truly a mutant is heavily debated  Lee and Kirby departed the series in 1966  handing the reins over to Roy Thomas and Werner Roth  Roth gave up the regular art chores in 1967  and Thomas dropped the scripting slot in 1968  The title went with no long term creative team for about a year  but had a couple notable artists  Jim Steranko drew several issues  one added the villain Mesmero to the cast and Barry Windsor Smith drew three issues  In 1969  Thomas returned  joined by fan favorite artist Neal Adams in an effort to save the series from its sagging sales  These issues are more highly regarded by fans and introduced recurring villains Sauron and the Living Monolith as well as two more X Men  Lorna Dane  later Polaris   a green haired mutant with similar powers to Magneto  and Havok  Alex Summers   Cyclops  rebellious brother who could absorb cosmic energy and use it to disintegrate objects or create energy bursts  Like his brother  he had great difficulty controlling his destructive powers  Though sales did improve while Adams illustrated the book  it was too little and too late  and Marvel stopped producing new issues of The X Men in 1970 with issue  66  The series continued by reprinting old issues and the X Men appeared in other Marvel comics   including prominent appearances in Marvel Team Up  The Avengers  The Incredible Hulk and Captain America   but faded to near obscurity   edit  1970s  edit  The all new  all different X Men In 1975  writer Len Wein and artist Dave Cockrum introduced a new team of X Men  Rather than teenagers  this group consisted of adults who hailed from a variety of nations and cultures  The wide range of cultures came from Marvel s intention to target the title in markets outside its U S  base  Giant Size X Men  1 introduced this team  called together by Professor X to rescue the original team from captivity on the radioactive  living island  of Krakoa  The  All New  All Different X Men  were led by Cyclops  and consisted of  Sunfire  Shiro Yoshida   a hot tempered Japanese mutant who could generate superheated plasma and fly  Thunderbird  John Proudstar   an Apache who possessed superhuman strength  speed  endurance  reflexes  and instinctual tracking senses and skills  Banshee  Sean Cassidy   an Irish mutant with a  sonic scream  that allows him to fly and generate concussive sonic blasts  Colossus  Piotr Rasputin   a quiet  contemplative Russian who could transform his entire body into  organic steel   increasing his size  strength  speed and endurance while making him virtually indestructible  Nightcrawler  Kurt Wagner   a rascally German who possessed great agility and the ability to teleport  His appearance  with iridescent eyes  blue velvet fur  three fingers on each hand  two toes on each foot  fangs  pointed ears  and a prehensile tail  makes him look like a demon  an ironic contrast to his strong  devout Catholic faith  Note that one of his lesser known powers is the ability to fade from view in shadows  Storm  Ororo Munroe   a strong willed woman who was raised in Africa  She is psychically linked to the weather patterns of Earth  allowing her to control and manipulate the weather  Storm would become the X Men s leader in times of Cyclops  absence  Wolverine  James  Logan  Howlett   a gruff Canadian government agent who possessed heightened senses  a regenerative  healing factor  which also slowed his aging process  and retractable adamantium claws  A covert agency named Weapon X had bonded the fictitious metal alloy to Wolverine s skeleton  Revealed piecemeal  Wolverine s origin would become one of the series  greatest mysteries  After Giant Size X Men  1  Marvel began publishing new issues of Uncanny X Men  featuring the new team minus Sunfire  who had quit  and Thunderbird  who had died in battle after two issues in Uncanny X Men  95  The series was illustrated by Cockrum and written by Chris Claremont  who would go on to become the longest standing contributor to the series  One of the most important storylines of this era was  The Phoenix Saga   Uncanny X Men  101 108  1977   in which Jean Grey seemingly bonded with a cosmic entity called the Phoenix and led the team on an intergalactic mission  The saga introduced the Shi ar alien race and its empress Lilandra  a recurring love interest of Professor X  Moira MacTaggert and Proteus were introduced as well  The Uncanny X Men  136  Art by John Byrne   In 1978  Cockrum was succeeded as penciller by John Byrne  who also co plotted the series with Claremont  soon retitled   informally in issue  114 and officially in issue  142   The Uncanny X Men   This marked the beginning of what many consider the X Men s first creative renaissance  during which the series became one of the most popular in the industry  Following a confrontation with Magneto  Professor X and Jean Grey believed the X Men lost and over the continuity of a year  the team fought its way back home  Byrne also introduced a series of Canadian themed adventures with the introduction of Alpha Flight  a Canadian super hero team  Wolverine consistently won awards as the most popular comic character   as a result  at least one issue per year between 1980 and 1984 focused on him  In 1982  Wolverine was given a limited series  penned by Claremont and drawn by Frank Miller  introducing the Japanese culture element of his character   edit  Dark Sagas Claremont and Byrne thrust the X Men into a variety of desperate situations that tested their character  most notably  The Dark Phoenix Saga   Uncanny X Men  129 137  1980   In this story  the aristocratic Hellfire Club seduced Phoenix  using Mastermind s mutant ability to create complex illusions  This tampering with her mind unleashed Phoenix s dark side  and she went on to destroy a populated solar system with over five billion inhabitants  Although the X Men tried to control her and apparently succeeded  Lilandra had Jean Grey captured in the hope of ending the Phoenix threat  Professor Xavier called for a duel of honor for the right not to surrender Phoenix  Lilandra  with the agreement of the Kree and Skrull as long as the superheroes  defeat was guaranteed  agreed to the challenge  The result was a battle on Earth s Moon between the Shi ar s Imperial Guard and the X Men  with Jean Grey s fate hanging in the balance  The X Men were eventually overwhelmed  but the stress of the battle  during which Cyclops was injured  overcame Phoenix s mental restraints against her dark persona  and it returned  At that point  Lilandra ordered the solar system destroyed in hopes that the Phoenix might be killed in the process  and Professor Xavier regretfully ordered the X Men to kill their teammate to prevent such destruction  Because of Jean Grey s humanity and willpower  Phoenix committed suicide to prevent further loss  a watershed moment for comics  major characters had rarely been killed up to that point  and sacrificial suicide had previously been inconceivable   The Dark Phoenix Saga  introduced several characters  including Kitty Pryde  Emma Frost   the White Queen of the Hellfire Club and future X Man   and Dazzler  For their swan song  Claremont and Byrne produced  Days of Future Past   Uncanny X Men  141 142  1981   which portrayed a dystopian future in which America is a wasteland controlled by Sentinels  In this alternate future  most of the X Men and other heroes are dead  and mutants are confined in concentration camps  In the storyline  the psyche of the adult  Kate Pryde  is sent back in time to the body of her younger self  Kitty   and she convinces the X Men to help her thwart the assassination of a senator by the shapeshifter Mystique and her new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants  including new characters Avalanche  Pyro  and Destiny as well as the Blob  This dark vision of a future created by fear  hatred  and intolerance has inspired many X Men stories in the years since  In 1982  Claremont wrote and Brent Anderson illustrated the graphic novel X Men  God Loves  Man Kills  in which Reverend William Stryker began a religious crusade against mutants  capturing and brainwashing Professor X to manipulate his powers to attack and eradicate mutant minds  The X Men united with Magneto to battle Stryker  resulting in one of the clearest examples of mutants as a metaphor for race relations in the series  More than twenty years later  the story inspired the plot of the second X Men film  Meanwhile  Uncanny X Men continued with Claremont and artists such as Paul Smith and later John Romita Jr   Early 1980s storylines introduced the aliens Deathbird and the Brood  the subterranean mutant gang the Morlocks and the futuristic mutant hunter Nimrod  explored Wolverine s love of Japanese aristocrat Mariko Yashida  saw Storm adjust to the temporary loss of her powers and form a relationship with the mutant government weapons contractor Forge  and delved into Cyclops  relationship with Madelyne Pryor  a seeming doppelg nger of Jean Grey  This last story ended with Cyclops marrying Madelyne and retiring from the X Men  The X Men gathered several new recruits in the early and mid 1980s  including  Sprite   Kitty Pryde   later briefly called Ariel and now Shadowcat  a Jewish American teenager who could  phase  through solid objects  walk on thin air  utilize her powers to scramble electronic systems and extend her intangibility to anything she touches  She would later be called Shadowcat after an adventure in Japan with Wolverine  Rogue  a southern belle who involuntarily drained powers and memories from anyone she touches  leaving them weakened or unconscious for the duration and permanently comatose in a few cases  Rogue was introduced as a member of Mystique s Brotherhood of Evil Mutants  Rachel Summers  the second Phoenix  later the second Marvel Girl  and the adult daughter of Cyclops and Jean Grey from the  Days of Futures Past  timeline  Telepathic  telekinetic  and able to travel through time astrally  she formerly acted as host of the Phoenix Force  which amplified her powers and allowed her to physically transport herself and other people or objects through time at will   edit  Mid to late 1980s  edit  The series becomes a franchise In the 1980s  the growing popularity of Uncanny X Men and the rise of comic book specialty stores lead to the introduction of several spin off series nicknamed  X Books   The first  The New Mutants  was launched in 1983 and featured a new group of teenaged mutants attending Xavier s school  In 1986  the original X Men  including a controversially resurrected Jean Grey  formed X Factor  In 1988 Marvel added the offbeat Excalibur  featuring Rachel Summers  Nightcrawler  Shadowcat  and the British superheroes Captain Britain and Meggan  In 1988  Wolverine was granted his own solo series  which often dealt with his struggles with personal honor and his past  With several spin off series being published alongside the main book  as well as storylines crossing through each book  X Men continuity became increasingly complex and difficult to follow  The X Men franchise became one of Marvel s most valuable assets during the decade and inspired other comic book properties  such as Spider Man and DC Comics  Superman and Batman  to create several interconnected  families  of multiple books  Another controversial move was to have Professor X relocate to space in 1986 after he sustained injuries so severe that only Shi ar technology could save his life  while a convenient solar flare prevented Xavier from returning to Earth  The major controversy arose from former arch villain Magneto taking Xavier s place in running the school as well as the X Men and New Mutants  This was the reason given for the original X Men s decision to form X Factor and keep their identities secret  as they thought the new team had  betrayed  Xavier by working with Magneto  This plethora of X Men related titles led to the rise of crossovers  sometimes called  X Overs   storylines which would overlap into several X Books  sometimes for months at a time  The first  1986 s  Mutant Massacre   featured the Marauders  a group a murderous mutants  who slaughtered the Morlocks and severely injured many of the X Men who intervened  Kitty Pryde and Nightcrawler s injuries allowed the writers to ship them off to England for Excalibur   The saga introduced Mister Sinister  a nefarious mutant geneticist who was the Marauders  leader and a central figure in many subsequent plots  It also brought Sabretooth  previously an opponent of the martial arts hero Iron Fist  into the X Men s world as an adversary for Wolverine  with hints that the two were linked in the past  During this period Claremont unveiled a new X Men line up consisting of Storm  Rogue  Wolverine  Colossus  Havok and several new and pre existing characters  Magneto  the team s then reformed former nemesis  was left in charge of the X Men and New Mutants by Xavier as he departed for outer space  Magneto left the X Men after he failed to prevent the death of one of the New Mutants  Douglas Ramsey  also known as Cypher   and ultimately reverted to villainy  It was during this era that Claremont expanded and gave Magneto his Holocaust origin  Longshot  a television action star with  good luck  powers from an absurdist alien dimension run by the tyrannical television network head Mojo  Dazzler  Alison Blaire   a former disco singer who could absorb sound energy and convert it into a variety of light effects  including lasers  Dazzler had been introduced in the book several years earlier and had had her own comic series in the intervening years  Psylocke  Betsy Braddock   originally introduced in the Captain Britain comic as an English telepath  she would change powers many times over the years  and would go through a body swap with a Japanese woman  becoming a sexy  martial artist femme fatale in the process  and is currently telekinetic  Also in this time period  in addition to crossovers  the X Men co starred in two mini series  The Fantastic Four vs  the X Men and The X Men vs  the Avengers  The former took care of a dangling plot thread left over from the  Mutant Massacre  story  as the Fantastic Four s leader  Mr  Fantastic  and their enemy  Dr  Doom  were needed to save Kitty Pryde s life  Following the 1987 Fall of the Mutants crossover  in which the X Men died and were reborn after fighting a demon called the Adversary in Dallas  the team briefly relocated to an abandoned outpost in Australia  This period of X Men history saw the introduction of the Reavers  a band of cyborg mercenaries  and the Inferno crossover  which revealed that Madelyne Pryor was actually a clone of Jean Grey created by Mister Sinister  The X Men and X Factor battled Pryor  who was now the insane Goblin Queen  and the demons she had allied herself with  One of the high points of the story was the reunion of X Factor and the X Men  X Factor had no idea the others were really alive  and the X Men had assumed Jean Grey was still dead  The Australian sojourn finally ended with Storm and Rogue presumed dead and most of the others  despondent  choosing to enter the Siege Perilous  a crystal which determined their individual fates  Claremont took this opportunity to write Dazzler and Longshot out of the series  they paired up and left to raise a child   Unlike most X characters  they were rarely seen or heard from since their departure  However in 2005  Dazzler returned in New Excalibur and has since rejoined the X Men  while Longshot was briefly teamed with the Exiles and is now a member of X Factor  In late 1989  Marvel began publishing Uncanny X Men twice a month  allowing Claremont to write intertwined plot threats involving a number of X Men  The 1990 crossover  the X Tinction Agenda  pulled the X Men back together  with Storm  Banshee  Wolverine  Psylocke and three new members  Forge  an American Indian with the mutant gift of instinctive invention  Jubilee  Jubilation Lee   a teenage Chinese American  mall rat  who could generate explosive energy  she calls fireworks  Jubilee stowed away with the X women when they teleported home from a mall excursion  She lived in their quarters without their knowledge for several weeks  finally revealing herself to save Wolverine from a crucifixion at the hands of Lady Deathstrike  Gambit  Remy LeBeau   a suave Cajun thief who could charge objects  most commonly playing cards  so that they exploded on impact when thrown  His hypnotic charm allows him to exert subtle influence over sentient minds  compelling them to believe what he says and agree with his suggestions  The final battle of this era  the Muir Island Saga  saw the X Men  X Factor and some allies fight an old nemesis of Xavier  the Shadow King  From 1987 until 1990 Marc Silvestri illustrated Uncanny X Men  He was succeeded by young artist Jim Lee  who was one of the most popular artists in comics during his tenure on the title   edit  1990s  edit  The sales boom of the 1990s X Men  1  was aided towards becoming the highest selling comic book of all time by the creation of several variant covers  including the wraparound and gatefold version above which contained all the art from the other four covers  Art by Jim Lee  After the X Men s return to Westchester  New York and Professor X s return to Earth in early 1991  Marvel revised the entire lineup of X books  Artist Rob Liefeld transformed The New Mutants into the platoon like X Force  led by the mysterious warhawk Cable  The original X Men abandoned X Factor and returned to the X Men  some of them much different from when they left  Beast had developed blue fur and earned a PhD in genetics and Angel  now called Archangel  had been transformed by the 5 000 year old supermutant Apocalypse and now had blue skin and metal wings  Meanwhile  Havok  Polaris and several secondary mutants formed a new  government affiliated X Factor  To make room for the enlarged main team  Marvel launched a second X Men series  simply called X Men  Written by Claremont and illustrated by Lee  the new series featured the  blue team   consisting of Beast  Psylocke  Rogue  Gambit  Cyclops and Wolverine  Uncanny X Men  scripted by John Byrne  for a time  with plots by Jim Lee and pencils by Whilce Portacio  featured the  gold team   consisting of Colossus  Iceman  Archangel  Jean Grey  Storm  and Bishop  a gun toting renegade mutant from a distant future  Professor X  Jubilee  Banshee and Forge stayed on as non combatant X Men  Banshee and Forge left soon after for various reasons  The popular art of Lee and Liefeld and the buzz produced by this reformation raised the X Men s popularity even further and the first issues of X Force and X Men became two of the best selling comic book issues of all time  thanks mainly to the sales boom from comics speculators  Amid the success  internal friction split the X Men books  creative teams  Claremont left after only three issues of X Men due to clashes with Marvel editors and with Lee  ending his fifteen year stint as X Men writer  John Byrne took over scripting duties  but this did not last   Months later  Liefeld and Lee left Marvel with several other popular artists  including Silvestri and Portacio  to form Image Comics  In the 2009 New York Comic Con  Claremont announced that he will return to his series in a new self contained continuity entitled X Men Forever  Claremont s first three issues of X Men were reprinted in 2009 as a kick off to the series  The X Men s rise in popularity continued  largely thanks to the Fox Network s top rated X Men animated series  which debuted in 1992  Meanwhile Uncanny X Men was handed over to writer Scott Lobdell and artist Joe Madureira  whose manga like style helped generate a new interest in Japanese comics in the U S  X Men continued with writer Fabian Nicieza and artist Andy Kubert  X overs proliferated  becoming almost annual events during the 1990s  Although they consistently boosted sales  fans began to complain that they were just contrived publicity stunts  Some of the more prominent crossovers from the decade include   The X Tinction Agenda   1990   in which the government of Genosha  a fictional island off the coast of Africa where mutants are used as prison labor  captured the X Teams   The Muir Island Saga   1991   in which the original X Factor and Xavier returned to the X Men   X Cutioner s Song   1992   in which Cable s clone and arch enemy Stryfe framed the X Force leader for an attempt on Professor X s life  He also captured and tormented Cyclops and Jean Grey  the genetic parents of both Cable and Stryfe  who were revealed to be time travelers   Fatal Attractions   1993   which Magneto returned  ripping out Wolverine s adamantium and forcing Xavier to mindwipe him  It was continued in  Bloodties    Phalanx Covenant   1994   in which a collective consciousness infected with the Transmode Virus infiltrated the X Mansion  kidnapped a small bunch of previously unknown mutants  including Husk   and plotted to eliminate mutant kind  The Phalanx was eventually thwarted by the few X Men who had not been incapacitated  and the cross over resulted in the Generation X series   Legion Quest   Age of Apocalypse   1995   in which Professor X was killed by his time traveling son Legion  David Haller  before he had ever formed the X Men  An alternate reality unfolded in which Apocalypse ruled North America and Magneto led the X Men as a resistance force   Onslaught   1996   which dominated all Marvel series for two months  In this storyline  Professor X lost control of his powers  producing an evil  near omnipotent secondary personality called Onslaught  which battled the X Men  The Avengers and the Fantastic Four   Operation  Zero Tolerance   1997   in which an anti mutant army is given government license to hunt down the X Teams and other mutants  Other important storylines included the second slaughter of the Morlocks  Iceman learning to deal with increased power levels  now able to turn completely into ice  the murder of Colossus  family and his subsequent defection to Magneto s Acolytes  Psylocke discovering the origin of her transformation from English model to Asian assassin  the burgeoning relationship between Rogue and Gambit  Jean Grey abandoning her Marvel Girl codename in favor of Phoenix  to honor both Rachel and the alien life force  Rogue briefly quitting after absorbing Gambit s psyche  Bishop dealing with faulty memories from a timeline that could not exist  Psylocke and Archangel s near murders at the hands of Sabretooth  warranting their leaving the team  Wolverine mutating into a strange  unintelligent beast after losing his adamantium at the hands of Magneto  Iceman quitting to nurse his bigoted father back to health after being attacked by anti mutant activists  and Gambit harboring a dark secret  he was the one who gathered the Marauders for Sinister  The 1990s saw an even greater number of X books  with numerous ongoing series and limited series running at any given time  Ongoing series from this time included Generation X  starring another team of teenage mutants and X Man  the offspring of Cyclops and Jean Grey from the Age of Apocalypse reality  Marvel launched solo series for several characters including Cable  Gambit  Bishop and Deadpool  a sarcastic mercenary antagonist of X Force  In 1998 Excalibur and X Factor ended and the latter was replaced with the parallel world series Mutant X starring Havok   edit  Late 1990s Early 2000s  edit  Era of reformations By the time  Operation  Zero Tolerance  concluded in 1997  major characters such as Bishop  Gambit  Jean Grey and Cyclops had been written out of the X Men  In place  writers assembled a new team consisting of Wolverine  Rogue  Beast  Storm and several newcomers including  Cannonball  Sam Guthrie   a former member of the New Mutants and X Force who flew at jet speeds  Joseph  thought at the time to be a mind wiped  and somehow de aged  Magneto  Marrow  Sarah   a former Morlock whose body grew protruding bones which she could remove and use as blades or clubs  Maggott  Japheth   a South African whose intestines took on the form of giant maggots  allowing him to digest any all matter  and Cecilia Reyes  a Puerto Rican doctor with a personal force field  Writers Joe Kelly and Steven Seagle  under editorial mandate  scrapped that team  keeping Marrow  Rogue  Storm and Wolverine and returning Shadowcat  Nightcrawler  Colossus  Gambit and Professor X to the fold  Kelly and Seagle would abruptly leave the titles  paving the way for Alan Davis  Fans considered Alan Davis  stint during which he illustrated X Men and Adam Kubert illustrated Uncanny X Men and which included the popular Magneto War and the critically mauled The Twelve  where Cyclops was killed off  storylines a moderate success  but Marvel ended it when Claremont agreed to return in early 2000 to write both core X Men series  With the event called  Revolution   Marvel instituted a six month time gap between issues of the X Books  allowing Claremont and illustrators to completely revise the X Men in a single month   A later mini series  X Men  Black Sun  filled in part of that gap   Claremont s second stint featured mainly a cast of the old regulars  A main team appeared in  X Men   consisting of Wolverine  Rogue  Colossus  Shadowcat  Psylocke  and a new Thunderbird  an Indian pyrokinetic named Neal Shaara  A sub team appeared in  Uncanny X Men  consisting of Gambit  Storm  Phoenix  Beast and Cable  X Force s former militaristic leader  now finally a full X Man  Claremont soon also introduced former Hellfire Club ally  Tessa  as an X Man  now called Sage  This character  who possessed telepathic powers and a computer like brain  had been seen as a part of the aristocratic club for years but was revealed to be a spy for Professor X  Wandering plot lines and forgettable new villains  such as the Neo  plagued Claremont s return  leading Marvel s new Editor in Chief Joe Quesada to remove him from the two flagship titles in early 2001  Quesada paired Claremont with artist Salvador Larroca for a new title  X Treme X Men  featuring Sage  Psylocke  Bishop  Gambit  Thunderbird  Rogue and Storm operating outside the central X Men  akin to the West Coast Avengers of the late 1980s early 1990s  At the same time  Marvel cancelled Gambit  Bishop  X Man  Mutant X and Generation X and completely overhauled X Force  While these series had sold well  Quesada argued that so many mutant superhero titles had become redundant  Marvel launched a few new books  not based on the theme of  fighting for a world that hates and fears them   including  Weapon X  a black ops villain team employing Sabretooth  Marrow and several other hard edged characters  Exiles  a group of reality hopping mutants from various parallel worlds  The new X Force  later retitled X Statix  a sardonic series featuring a group of publicity seeking  corporate sponsored mutant superheroes  Other drastic changes of this time included the deaths of long running characters Moira MacTaggert  Senator Kelly  both in the 2000 Dreams End crossover   Colossus  as part of the 2001 Eve of Destruction crossover  getting rid of the Legacy Virus   Apocalypse and Psylocke  and the long awaited uncovering of Wolverine s beginnings in the 2001 Origin limited series  edit  The Grant Morrison Years New X Men  114  2001  The start of Grant Morrison s run  The X Men abandon traditional superhero costumes for mainstream uniforms  Art by Frank Quitely  2001 also saw the ascent of writer Grant Morrison and artist Frank Quitely to X Men  retitled New X Men  featuring the line up of Beast  Jean Grey  Professor X  Cyclops  Wolverine and Emma Frost  a seductive telepath and former White Queen of the Hellfire Club  The team ditched their costumes in favor of black leather uniforms  resembling those of the 2000 X Men film  and a student body of teenage mutants was added to Xavier s School  New X Men was known for its multi faceted allegorical science fiction concepts and ambitious  unexpected twists and turns such as the killing of sixteen million mutants in Genosha at the hands of the Sentinels  as well as controversial changes in long established characterization  One of Morrison s more controversial plotlines involved the married Cyclops having a telepathic affair with Emma Frost behind Jean s back  as well as introducing Xavier s sister  Cassandra Nova  who was responsible for the Genoshan genocide  With his mutant status exposed to the mutant world  Xavier launched a corporation to help mutants worldwide  Morrison also returned Wolverine s passion for Jean  and wrote new details in his Weapon X backstory  Simultaneously Uncanny X Men was revamped by writer Joe Casey and artist Ian Churchill  who were later replaced by writer Chuck Austen and a revolving door of artists  While New X Men focused on Cyclops  five team members as teachers to a new generation   Uncanny  focused on an  away team  and traditional action and adventure  featuring team leader Archangel and members Iceman and Nightcrawler  They were soon joined by  Chamber  Jono Starsmore   a former member of Generation X whose chest was filled with psionic energy  Stacy X  Miranda Leevald   a former prostitute who controlled pheromones  Northstar   Jean Paul Beaubier   a former member of Canada s Alpha Flight team  Husk   Paige Guthrie   Cannonball s sister and another former Generation X member  who could rip off layers of skin to reveal stronger forms underneath  and  most surprisingly  The Juggernaut  Cain Marko   Xavier s stepbrother  who had been a criminal and enemy of the X Men since the mid 1960s  Austen had Juggernaut redeem himself in one of the few storylines of his run that was well received  Austen brought back Havok  who had been floating in limbo ever since Mutant X had been cancelled  as well as Polaris and Jubilee  Both Casey and Austen  however  received considerable backlash  Many critics felt Uncanny X Men was treading a derivative and well worn path  especially in comparison to the more adventurous New X Men  while fans often objected to the changes that were made  including retcons of Nightcrawler s previously becoming a Catholic Priest as well as his parentage  a change in the character of Polaris  turning her into a cruel and mentally disturbed terrorist  and confirming a longheld suspicion of being Magneto s daughter  and a controversial Archangel Husk romance  with Husk being an 18 year old roughly ten years Archangel s junior  Meanwhile  in  X Treme X Men   two other new characters were added to the team  Lifeguard  Heather Cameron   whose body would adapt to dangers thrown at her  and her brother  Slipstream  Davis Cameron   who could teleport using his  Warp Wave   Another popular new X Men series was Ultimate X Men  writer Mark Millar and artist Adam Kubert s reinvention of the concept featuring modern teenaged versions of the X Men and meant to appeal to new readers  Ultimate X Men was set in the  Ultimate Marvel Universe   alongside Ultimate Spider Man and Ultimates  Morrison concluded his run with the return of Magneto in Planet X and Here Comes Tomorrow and the death of Jean Grey  who once more bonded with the Phoenix Force  Controversially  Magneto became a full genocidalist and was decapitated by Wolverine  and once more Cyclops watched Jean die   edit  Mid 2000s  edit  ReLoad In 2004  Morrison left New X Men and Marvel prepared for what was already being called the  post Morrison period   in an event called X Men ReLoad  Marvel cancelled X Treme X Men and placed Claremont back on Uncanny X Men  This team  consisting of Storm  Wolverine  Bishop  Sage  Marvel Girl  Nightcrawler and Cannonball  had been granted U N  authority in an act called the X Treme Sanctions Executive  X S E   and were given full authority and government approved status equal to the Avengers to act as law enforcers to mutant activity across the world  New X Men reverted its title back to merely  X Men   and featured Havok  Polaris  Iceman  Juggernaut  Rogue and Gambit  The company also launched Astonishing X Men with writer Joss Whedon  well known as the creator of the cult television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer  and artist John Cassaday  Planetary  Astonishing featured Cyclops  Frost  Beast  Shadowcat and Wolverine  To set up the three new teams  Cyclops mandated the X Men ditch the leather outfits and return to their costumes  while unceremoniously removing Archangel  Husk  Jubilee and Northstar from active duty  Astonishing X Men became a hit among comic book fans due to Whedon s plotting and dialogue  and John Cassaday s clean and realistically styled art  Some attributed the title s success to its relatively straightforward presentation  many X Men books from the 1990s were known for complicated continuity and flashy art overshadowing the characters in the story  The series included the return of decisively dead X Man Colossus  which fans generally accepted due to the nature of his death several years earlier  Astonishing X Men earned a few spin off limited series  such as X Men  Phoenix   Endsong and Colossus  Bloodline  Psylocke was also resurrected in Uncanny X Men as Chris Claremont had intended on bringing her back ever since her death over in X Treme X Men  but was not allowed to due to a  Dead is Dead  rule at the time  Marvel also launched several new secondary X Books  including District X  in which Bishop polices a mutant neighborhood of New York City  New X Men  Academy X  a continuation of the recently launched New Mutants  vol  2  starring Xavier s student body  and a new Excalibur  featuring Magneto  with the previous story retconned into an imposter named Xorn and Professor X s attempt to rebuild Genosha  Rogue  Nightcrawler  Jubilee and Gambit all received their own eponymous ongoing series at this time  although Jubilee was cancelled after only six issues  as it had sold less copies per issue than any other X Men spinoff ever published at that point  Gambit and Rogue only made it to twelve issues each  Marvel ended X Statix when creators Peter Milligan and Mike Allred left  Milligan replaced Chuck Austen as writer of X Men in January 2005  Meanwhile  the long delayed series NYX introduced the character X 23  a teenage female clone of Wolverine who had originally appeared on the animated television series X Men  Evolution  X 23 subsequently joined the school in New X Men after helping the Uncanny X Men team   edit  Decimation Main articles  House of M and Decimation  comics  In 2005  Marvel s major crossover event  House of M resulted in a decimation of mutants  in which millions lost their powers  including Professor X and Magneto  Following the Deadly Genesis limited series  which revealed skeletons in Xavier s closet  he and Cyclops soon turned against one another and the villainous character of Vulcan  Cyclops  brother  was introduced  Also  Wolverine regained all his memories  continued in Wolverine  Origins  In the meantime  limited series such as Son of M  Generation M and The 198 dealt with the mutants who had lost their powers  with New X Men studying it in full  Apocalypse was also resurrected  who turned heroes such as Polaris and Gambit into villains  though both were rescued in due time  Meanwhile  the Avengers and Magneto dealt with the missing mutant power in the Collective  Afterwards  House of M led onto Marvel s 2006 crossover  Civil War  Chris Claremont also moved onto New Excalibur  Xavier founded a new team in a storyline continuing Deadly Genesis as Ed Brubaker took over Uncanny X Men  Astonishing X Men continued its successful run  but as Whedon s contract was renewed for another twelve issues following his original twelve issue contract and during 2006 the title became bi monthly to allow him time to finish his arcs  Whedon also returned Emma Frost to villainy  but not from free will  and subsequently redeemed her  Rogue formed a splinter group in X Men  consisting of seemingly reformed villains such as Mystique and Sabretooth  whilst the New X Men suffered the return of William Stryker   edit  Late 2000s  edit  Messiah CompleX Main articles  X Men  Endangered
