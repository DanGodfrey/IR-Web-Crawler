Electromagnetic pulse From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search This article is about the general weapons effect  For other uses  see the more specific topic  for example  Electromagnetic forming  An electromagnetic pulse  sometimes abbreviated EMP  is a burst of electromagnetic radiation  The abrupt pulse of electromagnetic radiation usually results from certain types of high energy explosions  especially a nuclear explosion  or from a suddenly fluctuating magnetic field  The resulting rapidly changing electric fields and magnetic fields may couple with electrical electronic systems to produce damaging current and voltage surges  In military terminology  a nuclear warhead detonated hundreds of kilometers above the Earth s surface is known as a high altitude electromagnetic pulse  HEMP  device  Effects of a HEMP device depend on a very large number of factors  including the altitude of the detonation  energy yield  gamma ray output  interactions with the Earth s magnetic field  and electromagnetic shielding of targets  Contents 1 History 1 1 Starfish Prime 1 2 Soviet Test 184 1 3 Non nuclear history 2 Characteristics of nuclear EMP 2 1 E1 2 2 E2 2 3

explosion was known since the earliest days of nuclear weapons testing  The magnitude of the EMP and the significance of its effects  however  were not realized for some time  1  During the first United States nuclear test on 16 July 1945  electronic equipment was shielded due to Enrico Fermi s expectation of an electromagnetic pulse from the detonation  The official technical history for that first nuclear test states   All signal lines were completely shielded  in many cases doubly shielded  In spite of this many records were lost because of spurious pickup at the time of the explosion that paralyzed the recording equipment   2   During British nuclear testing in 1952 1953 there were instrumentation failures that were attributed to  radioflash   which was then the British term for EMP  3  4  The high altitude nuclear tests of 1962  as described below  increased the awareness of EMP beyond the original small population of nuclear weapons scientists and engineers  The larger scientific community became aware of the significance of the EMP problem after a series of three articles were published about nuclear electromagnetic pulse in 1981 by William J  Broad in the weekly publication Science  1  5  6   edit  Starfish Prime Main article  Starfish Prime In July 1962  a 1 44 megaton  6 0 PJ  United States nuclear test in space  400 kilometres  250 mi  above the mid Pacific Ocean  called the Starfish Prime test  demonstrated to nuclear scientists that the magnitude and effects of a high altitude nuclear explosion were much larger than had been previously calculated  Starfish Prime also made those effects known to the public by causing electrical damage in Hawaii  about 1 445 kilometres  898 mi  away from the detonation point  knocking out about 300 streetlights  setting off numerous burglar alarms and damaging a telephone company microwave link  7  Starfish Prime was the first successful test in the series of United States high altitude nuclear tests in 1962 known as Operation Fishbowl  The subsequent Operation Fishbowl tests gathered more data on the high altitude EMP phenomenon  The Bluegill Triple Prime and Kingfish high altitude nuclear tests of October and November 1962 in Operation Fishbowl finally provided electromagnetic pulse data that was clear enough to enable physicists to accurately identify the physical mechanisms that were producing the electromagnetic pulses  8  The EMP damage of the Starfish Prime test was quickly repaired because of the ruggedness  compared to today  9  of the electrical and electronic infrastructure of Hawaii in 1962  The relatively small magnitude of the Starfish Prime EMP in Hawaii  about 5600 volts metre  and the relatively small amount of damage done  for example  only 1 to 3 percent of streetlights extinguished  10  led some scientists to believe  in the early days of EMP research  that the problem might not be as significant as was later realized  Newer calculations 9  showed that if the Starfish Prime warhead had been detonated over the northern continental United States  the magnitude of the EMP would have been much larger  22 to 30 kilovolts metre  because of the greater strength of the Earth s magnetic field over the United States  as well as the different orientation of the Earth s magnetic field at high latitudes  These new calculations  combined with the accelerating reliance on EMP sensitive microelectronics  heightened awareness that the EMP threat could be a very significant problem   edit  Soviet Test 184 Main article  The K Project In 1962  the Soviet Union also performed a series of three EMP producing nuclear tests in space over Kazakhstan  which were the last in the series called  The K Project   11  Although these weapons were much smaller  300 kiloton or 1 3 PJ  than the Starfish Prime test  since those tests were done over a populated large land mass  and also at a location where the Earth s magnetic field was greater   the damage caused by the resulting EMP was reportedly much greater than in the Starfish Prime nuclear test  The geomagnetic storm like E3 pulse  from the test designated as  Test 184   even induced an electric current surge in a long underground power line that caused a fire in the power plant in the city of Karaganda  After the collapse of the Soviet Union  the level of this damage was communicated informally to scientists in the United States  12   Formal documentation of some of the EMP damage in Kazakhstan exists 13  14  but is still sparse in the open scientific literature   edit  Non nuclear history The concept of the explosively pumped flux compression generator for generating a non nuclear electromagnetic pulse was conceived as early as 1951 by Andrei Sakharov in the Soviet Union  15  but nations have usually kept their most recent work on non nuclear EMP highly classified until the technology was old enough for similar ideas to be conceived by physicists in other nations   edit  Characteristics of nuclear EMP The case of a nuclear electromagnetic pulse differs from other kinds of electromagnetic pulse  EMP  in being a complex electromagnetic multi pulse  The complex multi pulse is usually described in terms of three components  and these three components have been defined as such by the international standards commission called the International Electrotechnical Commission  IEC   16  The three components of nuclear EMP  as defined by the IEC  are called E1  E2 and E3   edit  E1 The E1 pulse is the very fast component of nuclear EMP  The E1 component is a very brief but intense electromagnetic field that can quickly induce very high voltages in electrical conductors  The E1 component causes most of its damage by causing electrical breakdown voltages to be exceeded  E1 is the component that can destroy computers and communications equipment and it changes too quickly for ordinary lightning protectors to provide effective protection against it  The mechanism for a 400 km high altitude burst EMP  gamma rays hit the atmosphere between 20 40 km altitude  ejecting electrons which are then deflected sideways by the Earth s magnetic field  This makes the electrons radiate EMP over a massive area  Because of the curvature and downward tilt of Earth s magnetic field over the USA  the maximum EMP occurs south of the detonation and the minimum occurs to the north  17  The E1 component is produced when gamma radiation from the nuclear detonation knocks electrons out of the atoms in the upper atmosphere  The electrons begin to travel in a generally downward direction at relativistic speeds  more than 90 percent of the speed of light   In the absence of a magnetic field  this would produce a large pulse of electric current vertically in the upper atmosphere over the entire affected area  The Earth s magnetic field acts on these electrons to change the direction of electron flow to a right angle to the geomagnetic field  This interaction of the Earth s magnetic field and the downward electron flow produces a very large  but very brief  electromagnetic pulse over the affected area  18  Physicist Conrad Longmire has given numerical values for a typical case of the E1 pulse produced by a second generation nuclear weapon such as those used in high altitude tests of Operation Fishbowl in 1962  According to him  the typical gamma rays given off by the weapon have an energy of about 2 MeV  million electron volts   When these gamma rays collide with atoms in the mid stratosphere  the gamma rays knock out electrons  This is known as the Compton effect  and the resulting electrons produce an electric current that is known as the Compton current  The gamma rays transfer about half of their energy to the electrons  so these initial electrons have an energy of about 1 MeV  This causes the electrons to begin to travel in a generally downward direction at about 94 percent of the speed of light  Relativistic effects cause the mass of these high energy electrons to increase to about 3 times their normal rest mass  18  If there were no geomagnetic field and no additional atoms in the lower atmosphere for additional collisions  the electrons would continue to travel downward with an average current density in the stratosphere of about 48 amperes per square metre  18  Because of the downward tilt of the Earth s magnetic field at high latitudes  the area of peak field strength is a U shaped region to the equatorial side of the nuclear detonation  As shown in the diagram at the right  for nuclear detonations over the continental United States  this U shaped region is south of the detonation point  Near the equator  where the Earth s magnetic field is more nearly horizontal  the E1 field strength is more nearly symmetrical around the burst location  The Earth s magnetic field quickly deflects the electrons at right angles to the geomagnetic field  and the extent of the deflection depends upon the strength of the magnetic field  At geomagnetic field strengths typical of the central United States  central Europe or Australia  these initial electrons spiral around the magnetic field lines in a circle with a typical radius of about 85 metres  about 280 feet   These initial electrons are stopped by collisions with other air molecules at an average distance of about 170 metres  a little less than 580 feet   This means that most of the electrons are stopped by collisions with air molecules before they can complete one full circle of its spiral around the Earth s magnetic field lines  18  This interaction of the very rapidly moving negatively charged electrons with the magnetic field radiates a pulse of electromagnetic energy  The pulse typically rises to its peak value in about 5 nanoseconds  The magnitude of this pulse typically decays to half of its peak value within 200 nanoseconds   By the IEC definition  this E1 pulse is ended at one microsecond  1000 nanoseconds  after it begins   This process occurs simultaneously with about 1025 other electrons  18  There are a number of secondary collisions which cause the subsequent electrons to lose energy before they reach ground level  The electrons generated by these subsequent collisions have such reduced energy that they do not contribute significantly to the E1 pulse  18  These 2 MeV gamma rays will normally produce an E1 pulse near ground level at moderately high latitudes that peaks at about 50 000 volts per metre  This is a peak power density of 6 6 megawatts per square metre  The process of the gamma rays knocking electrons out of the atoms in the mid stratosphere causes this region of the atmosphere to become an electrical conductor due to ionization  a process which blocks the production of further electromagnetic signals and causes the field strength to saturate at about 50 000 volts per metre  The strength of the E1 pulse depends upon the number and intensity of the gamma rays produced by the weapon and upon the rapidity of the gamma ray burst from the weapon  The strength of the E1 pulse is also somewhat dependent upon the altitude of the detonation  There are reports of  super EMP  nuclear weapons that are able to overcome the 50 000 volt per metre limit by the very nearly instantaneous release of a burst of gamma radiation of much higher energy levels than are known to be produced by second generation nuclear weapons  The reality and possible construction details of these weapons are classified  and therefore cannot be confirmed by scientists in the open scientific literature  19   edit  E2 The E2 component is generated by scattered gamma rays and inelastic gammas produced by weapon neutrons  This E2 component is an  intermediate time  pulse that  by the IEC definition  lasts from about 1 microsecond to 1 second after the beginning of the electromagnetic pulse  The E2 component of the pulse has many similarities to the electromagnetic pulses produced by lightning  although the electromagnetic pulse induced by a nearby lightning strike may be considerably larger than the E2 component of a nuclear EMP  Because of the similarities to lightning caused pulses and the widespread use of lightning protection technology  the E2 pulse is generally considered to be the easiest to protect against  According to the United States EMP Commission  the main potential problem with the E2 component is the fact that it immediately follows the E1 component  which may have damaged the devices that would normally protect against E2  According to the EMP Commission Executive Report of 2004   In general  it would not be an issue for critical infrastructure systems since they have existing protective measures for defense against occasional lightning strikes  The most significant risk is synergistic  because the E2 component follows a small fraction of a second after the first component s insult  which has the ability to impair or destroy many protective and control features  The energy associated with the second component thus may be allowed to pass into and damage systems   20   edit  E3 The E3 component is very different from the other two major components of nuclear EMP  The E3 component of the pulse is a very slow pulse  lasting tens to hundreds of seconds  that is caused by the nuclear detonation heaving the Earth s magnetic field out of the way  followed by the restoration of the magnetic field to its natural place  The E3 component has similarities to a geomagnetic storm caused by a very severe solar flare  21  22  Like a geomagnetic storm  E3 can produce geomagnetically induced currents in long electrical conductors  which can then damage components such as power line transformers  23  Because of the similarity between solar induced geomagnetic storms and nuclear E3  it has become common to refer to solar induced geomagnetic storms as  solar EMP   24  At ground level  however   solar EMP  is not known to produce an E1 or E2 component  For a more thorough description of E3 damage mechanisms  see the main article  Geomagnetically induced current  edit  Practical considerations for nuclear EMP Older  vacuum tube  valve  based equipment is generally much less vulnerable to EMP than newer solid state equipment  Soviet Cold War era military aircraft often had avionics based on vacuum tubes due to both limitations in Soviet solid state capabilities and a belief that the vacuum tube gear would survive better  1  Although vacuum tubes are far more resistant to EMP than solid state devices  other components in vacuum tube circuitry can be damaged by EMP  Vacuum tube equipment actually was damaged in 1962 nuclear EMP testing  14   Also  the solid state PRC 77 VHF manpackable 2 way radio survived extensive EMP testing  25  The earlier PRC 25  nearly identical except for a vacuum tube final amplification stage  had been tested in EMP simulators but was not certified to remain fully functional  Many nuclear detonations have taken place using bombs dropped by aircraft  The B 29 aircraft that delivered the nuclear weapons at Hiroshima and Nagasaki did not lose power due to damage to their electrical or electronic systems  This is simply because electrons  ejected from the air by gamma rays  are stopped quickly in normal air for bursts below roughly 10 km  about 6 miles   so they do not get a chance to be significantly deflected by the Earth s magnetic field  the deflection causes the powerful EMP seen in high altitude bursts   thus the limited use of smaller burst altitudes for widespread EMP  26  If the aircraft carrying the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs had been within the intense nuclear radiation zone when the bombs exploded over those cities  then they would have suffered effects from the charge separation  radial  EMP  But this only occurs within the severe blast radius for detonations below about 10 km altitude  During nuclear tests in 1962  EMP disruptions were suffered aboard KC 135 photographic aircraft flying 300 km  190 mi  from the 410 kt  1 700 TJ  Bluegill Triple Prime and 410 kt  1 700 TJ  Kingfish detonations  48 and 95 km  30 and 59 mi  burst altitude  respectively  27  but the vital aircraft electronics were far less sophisticated than today and the aircraft were able to land safely   edit  Generation of nuclear EMP Several major factors control the effectiveness of a nuclear EMP weapon  These are The altitude of the weapon when detonated  The yield and construction details of the weapon  The distance from the weapon when detonated  Geographical depth or intervening geographical features  The local strength of the magnetic field of the Earth  Beyond a certain altitude a nuclear weapon will not produce any EMP  as the gamma rays will have had sufficient distance to disperse  In deep space or on worlds with no magnetic field  the moon or Mars for example  there will be little or no EMP  This has implications for certain kinds of nuclear rocket engines  such as Project Orion   edit  Weapon altitude How the area affected depends on the burst altitude  How the peak EMP on the ground varies with the weapon yield and burst altitude  The yield here is the prompt gamma ray output measured in kilotons  This varies from 0 115 0 5  of the total weapon yield  depending on weapon design  The 1 4 Mt total yield 1962 Starfish Prime test had a gamma output of 0 1   hence 1 4 kt of prompt gamma rays   The blue  pre ionisation  curve applies to certain types of thermonuclear weapon  where gamma and x rays from the primary fission stage ionise the atmosphere and make it electrically conductive before the main pulse from the thermonuclear stage  The pre ionisation in some situations can literally short out part of the final EMP  by allowing a conduction current to immediately oppose the Compton current of electrons   28  29  According to an internet primer published by the Federation of American Scientists 30  A high altitude nuclear detonation produces an immediate flux of gamma rays from the nuclear reactions within the device  These photons in turn produce high energy free electrons by Compton scattering at altitudes between  roughly  20 and 40 km  These electrons are then trapped in the Earth s magnetic field  giving rise to an oscillating electric current  This current is asymmetric in general and gives rise to a rapidly rising radiated electromagnetic field called an electromagnetic pulse  EMP   Because the electrons are trapped essentially simultaneously  a very large electromagnetic source radiates coherently  The pulse can easily span continent sized areas  and this radiation can affect systems on land  sea  and air  The first recorded EMP incident accompanied a high altitude nuclear test over the South Pacific and resulted in power system failures as far away as Hawaii  A large device detonated at 400 500 km  250 to 312 miles  over Kansas would affect all of the continental U S  The signal from such an event extends to the visual horizon as seen from the burst point  Thus  for equipment to be affected  the weapon needs to be above the visual horizon  Because of the nature of the pulse as a large  high powered  noisy spike  it is doubtful that there would be much protection if the explosion were seen in the sky just below the tops of hills or mountains  The altitude indicated above is greater than that of the International Space Station and many low Earth orbit satellites  Large weapons could have a dramatic impact on satellite operations and communications such as occurred during the 1962 tests  The damaging effects on orbiting satellites are usually due to other factors besides EMP  In the Starfish Prime nuclear test  most satellite damage was due to damage to the solar panels from satellites passing through radiation belts created by the high altitude nuclear explosion  31   edit  Weapon yield Typical nuclear weapon yields used during Cold War planning for EMP attacks were in the range of 1 to 10 megatons  4 2 to 42 PJ  32  This is roughly 50 to 500 times the sizes of the weapons the United States used in Japan at Hiroshima and Nagasaki  Physicists have testified at United States Congressional hearings  however  that weapons with yields of 10 kilotons  42 TJ  or less can produce a very large EMP  33  If one compares explosions with different yields  the EMP at a fixed distance from a nuclear weapon would not increase at the same rate as the explosion yield  but at most only as the square root of the yield  see the illustration to the right    This means that although a 10 kiloton weapon has only 0 7  of the total energy release of the 1 44 megaton Starfish Prime test  the EMP will be at least 8  as powerful  Since the E1 component of nuclear EMP depends on the prompt gamma ray output  which was only 0 1  of yield in Starfish Prime but can be 0 5  of yield in pure fission weapons of low yield  a 10 kiloton bomb can easily be 5 x 8    40  as powerful as the 1 44 megaton Starfish Prime at producing EMP  27  The total prompt gamma ray energy in a fission explosion is 3 5  of the yield  but in a 10 kiloton detonation the high explosive around the bomb core absorbs about 85  of the prompt gamma rays  so the output is only about 0 5  of the yield in kilotons  In the thermonuclear Starfish Prime the fission yield was less than 100  to begin with  and then the thicker outer casing absorbed about 95  of the prompt gamma rays from the pusher around the fusion stage  Thermonuclear weapons are also less efficient at producing EMP because the first stage can pre ionize the air 27  which becomes conductive and hence rapidly shorts out the electron Compton currents generated by the final  larger yield thermonuclear stage  Hence  small pure fission weapons with thin cases are far more efficient at causing EMP than most megaton bombs  This analysis  however  only applies to the fast E1 and E2 components of nuclear EMP  The geomagnetic storm like E3 component of nuclear EMP is more closely proportional to the total energy yield of the weapon  34   edit  Weapon distance A unique and important aspect of nuclear EMP is that all of the components of the electromagnetic pulse are generated outside of the weapon  The important E1 component is generated by interaction with the electrons in the upper atmosphere that are hit by gamma radiation from the weapon   and the subsequent effects upon those electrons by the Earth s magnetic field  30  For high altitude nuclear explosions  this means that much of the EMP is actually generated at a large distance from the detonation  where the gamma radiation from the explosion hits the upper atmosphere   This causes the electric field from the EMP to be remarkably uniform over the large area affected  According to the standard reference text on nuclear weapons effects published by the U S  Department of Defense   The peak electric field  and its amplitude  at the Earth s surface from a high altitude burst will depend upon the explosion yield  the height of the burst  the location of the observer  and the orientation with respect to the geomagnetic field   As a general rule  however  the field strength may be expected to be tens of kilovolts per metre over most of the area receiving the EMP radiation   35  The same reference book also states that       over most of the area affected by the EMP the electric field strength on the ground would exceed 0 5Emax    For yields of less than a few hundred kilotons  this would not necessarily be true because the field strength at the Earth s tangent could be substantially less than 0 5Emax   35   Emax refers to the maximum electric field strength in the affected area   In other words  the electric field strength in the entire area that is affected by the EMP will be fairly uniform for weapons with a large gamma ray output  but for much smaller weapons  the electric field may fall off at a comparatively faster rate at large distances from the detonation point  It is the peak electric field of the EMP that determines the peak voltage induced in equipment and other electrical conductors on the ground  and most of the damage is determined by induced voltages  For nuclear detonations within the atmosphere  the situation is more complex  Within the range of gamma ray deposition  simple laws no longer hold as the air is ionised and there are other EMP effects  such as a radial electric field due to the separation of Compton electrons from air molecules  together with other complex phenomena  For a surface burst  absorption of gamma rays by air would limit the range of gamma ray deposition to approximately 10 miles  while for a burst in the lower density air at high altitudes  the range of deposition would be far greater   edit  Non nuclear electromagnetic pulse Non nuclear electromagnetic pulse  NNEMP  is an electromagnetic pulse generated without use of nuclear weapons  There are a number of devices that can achieve this objective  ranging from a large low inductance capacitor bank discharged into a single loop antenna or a microwave generator to an explosively pumped flux compression generator  To achieve the frequency characteristics of the pulse needed for optimal coupling into the target  wave shaping circuits and or microwave generators are added between the pulse source and the antenna  A vacuum tube particularly suitable for microwave conversion of high energy pulses is the vircator  36  NNEMP generators can be carried as a payload of bombs  cruise missiles and drones  allowing construction of electromagnetic bombs with diminished mechanical  thermal and ionizing radiation effects and without the political consequences of deploying nuclear weapons  The range of NNEMP weapons  non nuclear electromagnetic pulse bombs  is severely limited compared to nuclear EMP  This is because nearly all NNEMP devices used as weapons require chemical explosives as their initial energy source  but nuclear explosives have an energy yield on the order of one million times that of chemical explosives of similar weight  37   In addition to the large difference in the energy density of the initial energy source  the electromagnetic pulse from NNEMP weapons must come from within the weapon itself  while nuclear weapons generate EMP as a secondary effect  often at great distances from the detonation  29   These facts severely limit the range of NNEMP weapons as compared to their nuclear counterparts  but allow for more surgical target discrimination  The effect of small e bombs has proven to be sufficient for certain terrorist or military operations  Examples of such operations include the destruction of certain fragile electronic control systems of the type critical to the operation of many ground vehicles and aircraft  38  A right front view of a Boeing E 4 National Airborne Operations Center

facility  antennae at top of image   Information about the EMP simulators used by the United States during the latter part of the Cold War  along with more general information about electromagnetic pulse  are now in papers under the care of the SUMMA Foundation  39  which is now hosted at the University of New Mexico  The SUMMA Foundation web site includes documentation about the huge wooden ATLAS I simulator  better known as TRESTLE  or  The Sandia Trestle   at Sandia National Labs  New Mexico  which was the world s largest EMP simulator  40   Nearly all of these large EMP simulators used a specialized version of a Marx generator  3  4   The SUMMA Foundation now has a 44 minute documentary movie on its web site called  TRESTLE  Landmark of the Cold War   41  Many large EMP simulators were also built in the Soviet Union  as well as in the United Kingdom  France  Germany  The Netherlands  Switzerland and Italy  3  4   edit  Post Cold War nuclear EMP attack scenarios The United States military services have developed  and in some cases have published  a number of hypothetical EMP attack scenarios  42  The United States EMP Commission was authorized by the United States Congress in Fiscal Year 2001  and re authorized in Fiscal Year 2006  The commission is formally known as the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse  EMP  Attack  43  The United States EMP Commission has brought together a group of notable scientists and technologists to compile several reports  In 2008  the EMP Commission released the Critical National Infrastructures Report  34  This report describes  in as much detail as practical  the likely consequences of a nuclear EMP on civilian infrastructures  Although this report was directed specifically toward the United States  most of the information can obviously be generalized to the civilian infrastructure of other industrialized countries  The 2008 report was a followup to a more generalized report issued by the commission in 2004  22  44  In written testimony delivered to the United States Senate in 2005  an EMP Commission staff member reported  The EMP Commission sponsored a worldwide survey of foreign scientific and military literature to evaluate the knowledge  and possibly the intentions  of foreign states with respect to electromagnetic pulse  EMP  attack  The survey found that the physics of EMP phenomenon and the military potential of EMP attack are widely understood in the international community  as reflected in official and unofficial writings and statements  The survey of open sources over the past decade finds that knowledge about EMP and EMP attack is evidenced in at least Britain  France  Germany  Israel  Egypt  Taiwan  Sweden  Cuba  India  Pakistan  Iraq under Saddam Hussein  Iran  North Korea  China and Russia        Many foreign analysts particularly in Iran  North Korea  China  and Russia view the United States as a potential aggressor that would be willing to use its entire panoply of weapons  including nuclear weapons  in a first strike  They perceive the United States as having contingency plans to make a nuclear EMP attack  and as being willing to execute those plans under a broad range of circumstances  Russian and Chinese military scientists in open source writings describe the basic principles of nuclear weapons designed specifically to generate an enhanced EMP effect  that they term  Super EMP  weapons   Super EMP  weapons  according to these foreign open source writings  can destroy even the best protected U S  military and civilian electronic systems  19   edit  Clarification of common misconceptions In non technical writings about nuclear EMP  both in print and on the Internet  some common misconceptions about EMP are nearly always found  These widely repeated misconceptions have led to a very considerable amount of confusion about the subject  In 2010  a technical report written for the US government s Oak Ridge National Laboratory even included a brief section addressing some of those EMP myths  45   Here are some further clarifications on common areas of confusion that have already been discussed  with references  in the above sections of this article  Most nuclear weapons effects vary greatly depending upon the altitude of the detonation  This is especially true of nuclear EMP  The standard reference text on nuclear weapon effects published by the U S  Department of Defense discusses this relationship extensively in the first two chapters  and provides mutually exclusive definitions for phrases such as  air burst  and  high altitude burst    46  As explained in above sections of this article  nuclear detonations at all altitudes within the Earth s magnetic field will produce an electromagnetic pulse  but the magnitude of the EMP and area that is affected by the EMP are strongly affected by many factors  and is especially strongly dependent upon the altitude of the detonation   See the discussion above in the  Weapon altitude  and  Weapon distance  sections    A nuclear explosion in deep space and not in a strong planetary magnetic field would be ineffective at generating EMP  EMP is not a new kind of weapon effect  As stated in the  History  section above  nuclear EMP from a nuclear air burst has been known since 1945  The unique characteristics of high altitude nuclear EMP have been known since at least 1962  Non nuclear EMP has been known since at least 1951  Electromagnetic pulse is a prompt secondary effect of a nuclear explosion  and nearly all of the nuclear EMP is produced outside of the weapon   All nuclear weapons can produce EMP as a secondary effect  but the effect can be enhanced by special weapon design  19  22  The E3 component of nuclear EMP that produces geomagnetically induced currents in very long electrical conductors is roughly proportional to the total energy yield of the weapon  The other components of nuclear EMP are less likely to be dependent on total energy yield of the weapon  The E1 component  in particular  is proportional to prompt gamma ray output  but EMP levels can be strongly affected if more than one burst of gamma rays occurs in a short time period  Large thermonuclear weapons produce large energy yields through a multi stage process  This multi stage process is completed within a small fraction of a second  but it nevertheless requires a finite length of time  The first fission reaction is usually of relatively small yield  and the gamma rays produced by the first stage pre ionize atmospheric molecules in the stratosphere  This pre ionization causes the gamma ray emission from the high energy final stage of the thermonuclear weapon  a fraction of a second later  to be relatively ineffective at producing a large E1 pulse  33  34   See the blue pre ionization curve in the  Peak Electric Field at Ground Zero  graph above   It has long been known that there are many ways to protect against nuclear EMP  or to quickly begin repairs where protection is not practical   but the United States EMP Commission determined that such protections are almost completely absent in the civilian infrastructure of the United States  and that even large sectors of the United States military services were no longer protected against EMP to the level that they were during the Cold War  The public statements of the physicists and engineers working in the EMP field tend to emphasize the importance of making electronic equipment and electrical components resistant to EMP   and of keeping adequate spare parts on hand  and in the proper location  to enable prompt repairs to be made  22  34  47  The United States EMP Commission did not look at the civilian infrastructures of other nations   edit  See also Electromagnetism portal Electromagnetic environment Electromagnetic hypersensitivity Electromagnetic pulse in fiction and popular culture Electromagnetic weapon
