matter 1  and its motion through spacetime  along with related concepts such as energy and force  2  More broadly  it is the general analysis of nature  conducted in order to understand how the universe behaves  3  4  5  Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines  perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of astronomy  6  Over the last two millennia  physics was a part of natural philosophy along with chemistry  certain branches of mathematics  and biology  but during the Scientific Revolution in the 16th century  the natural sciences emerged as unique research programs in their own right  7  Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research  such as biophysics and quantum chemistry  and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined  New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms of other sciences  while opening new avenues of research in areas such as mathematics and philosophy  Physics also makes significant contributions through advances in new technologies that arise from theoretical breakthroughs  For example  advances in the understanding of electromagnetism or nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products which have dramatically transformed modern day society  such as television  computers  domestic appliances  and nuclear weapons  advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization  and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus  Contents 1 History 2 Philosophy 3 Core theories 3 1 Fundamental physics 4 Relation to other fields 4 1 Prerequisites

History of physics As noted below  the means used to understand the behavior of natural phenomena and their effects evolved from philosophy  progressively replaced by natural philosophy then natural science  to eventually arrive at the modern conception of physics  citation needed  Natural philosophy has its origins in Greece during the Archaic period   650 BCE   480 BCE   when Pre Socratic philosophers like Thales refused supernatural  religious or mythological explanations for natural phenomena and proclaimed that every event had a natural cause  8  They proposed ideas verified by reason and observation and many of their hypotheses proved successful in experiment  9  for example atomism  Natural science was developed in China  India and in Islamic caliphates  between the 4th and 10th century BCE  citation needed Quantitative descriptions became popular among physicists and astronomers  for example Archimedes in the domains of mechanics  statics and hydrostatics  Experimental physics had its debuts with experimentation concerning statics by medieval Muslim physicists like al Biruni and Alhazen  10  11  Classical physics became a separate science when early modern Europeans used these experimental and quantitative methods to discover what are now considered to be the laws of physics  12  13 Kepler  Galileo and more specifically Newton discovered and unified the different laws of motion  14  During the industrial revolution  as energy needs increased  so did research  which led to the discovery of new laws in thermodynamics  chemistry and electromagnetics  Solvay Conference of 1927  with prominent physicists such as Albert Einstein  Niels Bohr  Marie Curie  Erwin Schr dinger and Paul Dirac  Modern physics started with the works of Einstein both in relativity and quantum physics  citation needed  Philosophy For more details on this topic  see Philosophy of physics  In many ways  physics stems from ancient Greek philosophy  From Thales  first attempt to characterize matter  to Democritus  deduction that matter ought to reduce to an invariant state  the Ptolemaic astronomy of a crystalline firmament  and Aristotle s book Physics  an early book on physics  which attempted to analyze and define motion from a philosophical point of view   various Greek philosophers advanced their own theories of nature  Physics was known as natural philosophy until the late 18th century  By the 19th century physics was realized as a discipline distinct from philosophy and the other sciences  Physics  as with the rest of science  relies on philosophy of science to give an adequate description of the scientific method  15  The scientific method employs a priori reasoning as well as a posteriori reasoning and the use of Bayesian inference to measure the validity of a given theory  16  The development of physics has answered many questions of early philosophers  but has also raised new questions  Study of the philosophical issues surrounding physics  the philosophy of physics  involves issues such as the nature of space and time  determinism  and metaphysical outlooks such as empiricism  naturalism and realism  17  Many physicists have written about the philosophical implications of their work  for instance Laplace  who championed causal determinism  18  and Erwin Schr dinger  who wrote on quantum mechanics  19  The mathematical physicist Roger Penrose has been called a Platonist by Stephen Hawking  20  a view Penrose discusses in his book  The Road to Reality  21  Hawking refers to himself as an  unashamed reductionist  and takes issue with Penrose s views  22  Core theories Further information  Branches of physics  Classical physics  Modern physics  Outline of physics Though physics deals with a wide variety of systems  certain theories are used by all physicists  Each of these theories were experimentally tested numerous times and found correct as an approximation of nature  within a certain domain of validity   For instance  the theory of classical mechanics accurately describes the motion of objects  provided they are much larger than atoms and moving at much less than the speed of light  These theories continue to be areas of active research  and a remarkable aspect of classical mechanics known as chaos was discovered in the 20th century  three centuries after the original formulation of classical mechanics by Isaac Newton  1642 1727   These central theories are important tools for research into more specialized topics  and any physicist  regardless of his or her specialization  is expected to be literate in them  These include classical mechanics  quantum mechanics  thermodynamics and statistical mechanics  electromagnetism  and special relativity  Fundamental physics The basic domains of physics While physics aims to discover universal laws  its theories lie in explicit domains of applicability  Loosely speaking  the laws of classical physics accurately describe systems whose important length scales are greater than the atomic scale and whose motions are much slower than the speed of light  Outside of this domain  observations do not match their predictions  Albert Einstein contributed the framework of special relativity  which replaced notions of absolute time and space with spacetime and allowed an accurate description of systems whose components have speeds approaching the speed of light  Max Planck  Erwin Schr dinger  and others introduced quantum mechanics  a probabilistic notion of particles and interactions that allowed an accurate description of atomic and subatomic scales  Later  quantum field theory unified quantum mechanics and special relativity  General relativity allowed for a dynamical  curved spacetime  with which highly massive systems and the large scale structure of the universe can be well described  General relativity has not yet been unified with the other fundamental descriptions  several candidates theories of quantum gravity are being developed  Relation to other fields This parabola shaped lava flow illustrates the application of Mathematics in Physics   in this case  Galileo s law of falling bodies  Mathematics and Ontology are used in Physics  Physics is used in Chemistry and Cosmology  Prerequisites Mathematics is the language used for compact description of the order in nature  especially the laws of Physics  This was noted and advocated by Pythagoras  23  Plato  24  Galileo  25  and Newton  Physics theories use Mathematics 26  to obtain order and provide precise formulas  precise or estimated solutions  quantitative results and predictions  Experiment results in physics are numerical measurements  Technologies based on Mathematics  like computation have made computational physics an active area of research  The distinction between Mathematics and Physics is clear cut  but not always obvious  especially in Mathematical Physics  Ontology is a prerequisite for Physics  but not for Mathematics  It means Physics is ultimately concerned with descriptions of the real world  while Mathematics is concerned with abstract patterns  even beyond the real world  Thus Physics statements are synthetic  while Math statements are analytic  Mathematics contains hypothesis  while Physics contains theories  Mathematics statements have to be only logically true  while predictions of Physics statements must match observed and experimental data  The distinction is clear cut  but not always obvious  For example  Mathematical Physics is the application of Mathematics in Physics  Its methods are Mathematical  but its subject is Physical  27  The problems in this field start with a  Math model of a Physical situation  and a  Math description of a Physical law   Every math statement used for solution has a hard to find Physical meaning  The final Mathematical solution has an easier to find meaning  because it is what the solver is looking for  Physics is a branch of fundamental science  not practical science  28  Physics is also called  the fundamental science  because the subject of study of all branches of natural science like Chemistry  Astronomy  Geology and Biology are constrained by laws of physics  29  For example  Chemistry studies properties  structures  and reactions of matter  chemistry s focus on the atomic scale distinguishes it from physics   Structures are formed because particles exert electrical forces on each other  properties include physical characteristics of given substances  and reactions are bound by laws of physics  like conservation of energy  mass and charge  Physics is applied in industries like engineering and medicine  Application and influence Archimedes  screw  a simple machine for lifting The application of physical laws in lifting liquids Main article  Applied physics Applied physics is a general term for physics research which is intended for a particular use  An applied physics curriculum usually contains a few classes in an applied discipline  like geology or electrical engineering  It usually differs from engineering in that an applied physicist may not be designing something in particular  but rather is using physics or conducting physics research with the aim of developing new technologies or solving a problem  The approach is similar to that of applied mathematics  Applied physicists can also be interested in the use of physics for scientific research  For instance  people working on accelerator physics might seek to build better particle detectors for research in theoretical physics  Physics is used heavily in engineering  For example  Statics  a subfield of mechanics  is used in the building of bridges and other structures  The understanding and use of acoustics results in better concert halls  similarly  the use of optics creates better optical devices  An understanding of physics makes for more realistic flight simulators  video games  and movies  and is often critical in forensic investigations  With the standard consensus that the laws of physics are universal and do not change with time  physics can be used to study things that would ordinarily be mired in uncertainty  For example  in the study of the origin of the Earth  one can reasonably model Earth s mass  temperature  and rate of rotation  over time  It also allows for simulations in engineering which drastically speed up the development of a new technology  But there is also considerable interdisciplinarity in the physicist s methods and so many other important fields are influenced by physics  e g  the fields of econophysics and sociophysics  Research Scientific method Physicists use a scientific method to test the validity of a physical theory  using a methodical approach to compare the implications of the theory in question with the associated conclusions drawn from experiments and observations conducted to test it  Experiments and observations are collected and compared with the predictions and hypotheses made by a theory  thus aiding in the determination or the validity invalidity of the theory  Theories which are very well supported by data and have never failed any competent empirical test are often called scientific laws  or natural laws  Of course  all theories  including those called scientific laws  can always be replaced by more accurate  generalized statements if a disagreement of theory with observed data is ever found  30  Theory and experiment Main articles  Theoretical physics and Experimental physics The astronaut and Earth are both in free fall Lightning is an electric current Theorists seek to develop mathematical models that both agree with existing experiments and successfully predict future results  while experimentalists devise and perform experiments to test theoretical predictions and explore new phenomena  Although theory and experiment are developed separately  they are strongly dependent upon each other  Progress in physics frequently comes about when experimentalists make a discovery that existing theories cannot explain  or when new theories generate experimentally testable predictions  which inspire new experiments  Physicists who work at the interplay of theory and experiment are called phenomenologists  Phenomenologists look at the complex phenomena observed in experiment and work to relate them to fundamental theory  Theoretical physics has historically taken inspiration from philosophy  electromagnetism was unified this way  31  Beyond the known universe  the field of theoretical physics also deals with hypothetical issues  32  such as parallel universes  a multiverse  and higher dimensions  Theorists invoke these ideas in hopes of solving particular problems with existing theories  They then explore the consequences of these ideas and work toward making testable predictions  Experimental physics informs  and is informed by  engineering and technology  Experimental physicists involved in basic research design and perform experiments with equipment such as particle accelerators and lasers  whereas those involved in applied research often work in industry  developing technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging  MRI  and transistors  Feynman has noted that experimentalists may seek areas which are not well explored by theorists  33  Scope and aims Physics involves modeling the natural world with theory  usually quantitative  Here  the path of a particle is modeled with the mathematics of calculus to explain its behavior  the purview of the branch of physics known as mechanics  Physics covers a wide range of phenomena  from elementary particles  such as quarks  neutrinos and electrons  to the largest superclusters of galaxies  Included in these phenomena are the most basic objects composing all other things  Therefore physics is sometimes called the  fundamental science   29  Physics aims to describe the various phenomena that occur in nature in terms of simpler phenomena  Thus  physics aims to both connect the things observable to humans to root causes  and then connect these causes together  For example  the ancient Chinese observed that certain rocks  lodestone  were attracted to one another by some invisible force  This effect was later called magnetism  and was first rigorously studied in the 17th century  A little earlier than the Chinese  the ancient Greeks knew of other objects such as amber  that when rubbed with fur would cause a similar invisible attraction between the two  This was also first studied rigorously in the 17th century  and came to be called electricity  Thus  physics had come to understand two observations of nature in terms of some root cause  electricity and magnetism   However  further work in the 19th century revealed that these two forces were just two different aspects of one force   electromagnetism  This process of  unifying  forces continues today  and electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force are now considered to be two aspects of the electroweak interaction  Physics hopes to find an ultimate reason  Theory of Everything  for why nature is as it is  see section Current research below for more information   Research fields Contemporary research in physics can be broadly divided into condensed matter physics  atomic  molecular  and optical physics  particle physics  astrophysics  geophysics and biophysics  Some physics departments also support research in Physics education  Since the twentieth century  the individual fields of physics have become increasingly specialized  and today most physicists work in a single field for their entire careers   Universalists  such as Albert Einstein  1879 1955  and Lev Landau  1908 1968   who worked in multiple fields of physics  are now very rare  34  Table of the major fields of physics  along with their subfields and the theories they employ Field Subfields

new phase of matter  the Bose Einstein condensate Condensed matter physics is the field of physics that deals with the macroscopic physical properties of matter  In particular  it is concerned with the  condensed  phases that appear whenever the number of constituents in a system is extremely large and the interactions between the constituents are strong  The most familiar examples of condensed phases are solids and liquids  which arise from the bonding and electromagnetic force between atoms  More exotic condensed phases include the superfluid and the Bose Einstein condensate found in certain atomic systems at very low temperature  the superconducting phase exhibited by conduction electrons in certain materials  and the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of spins on atomic lattices  Condensed matter physics is by far the largest field of contemporary physics  Historically  condensed matter physics grew out of solid state physics  which is now considered one of its main subfields  The term condensed matter physics was apparently coined by Philip Anderson when he renamed his research group   previously solid state theory   in 1967  In 1978  the Division of Solid State Physics at the American Physical Society was renamed as the Division of Condensed Matter Physics  35  Condensed matter physics has a large overlap with chemistry  materials science  nanotechnology and engineering  Atomic  molecular  and optical physics Main article  Atomic  molecular  and optical physics Atomic  molecular  and optical physics  AMO  is the study of matter matter and light matter interactions on the scale of single atoms and molecules  The three areas are grouped together because of their interrelationships  the similarity of methods used  and the commonality of the energy scales that are relevant  All three areas include both classical  semi classical and quantum treatments  they can treat their subject from a microscopic view  in contrast to a macroscopic view   Atomic physics studies the electron shells of atoms  Current research focuses on activities in quantum control  cooling and trapping of atoms and ions  citation needed  low temperature collision dynamics and the effects of electron correlation on structure and dynamics  Atomic physics is influenced by the nucleus  see  e g   hyperfine splitting   but intra nuclear phenomenon such as fission and fusion are considered part of high energy physics  Molecular physics focuses on multi atomic structures and their internal and external interactions with matter and light  Optical physics is distinct from optics in that it tends to focus not on the control of classical light fields by macroscopic objects  but on the fundamental properties of optical fields and their interactions with matter in the microscopic realm  High energy physics  particle physics  Main article  Particle physics A simulated event in the CMS detector of the Large Hadron Collider  featuring a possible appearance of the Higgs boson  Particle physics is the study of the elementary constituents of matter and energy  and the interactions between them  It may also be called  high energy physics   because many elementary particles do not occur naturally  but are created only during high energy collisions of other particles  as can be detected in particle accelerators  Currently  the interactions of elementary particles are described by the Standard Model  The model accounts for the 12 known particles of matter  quarks and leptons  that interact via the strong  weak  and electromagnetic fundamental forces  Dynamics are described in terms of matter particles exchanging gauge bosons  gluons  W and Z bosons  and photons  respectively   The Standard Model also predicts a particle known as the Higgs boson  the existence of which has not yet been verified  as of 2010 update   searches for it are underway in the Tevatron at Fermilab and in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN  Astrophysics Main articles  Astrophysics and Physical cosmology The deepest visible light image of the universe  the Hubble Ultra Deep Field Astrophysics and astronomy are the application of the theories and methods of physics to the study of stellar structure  stellar evolution  the origin of the solar system  and related problems of cosmology  Because astrophysics is a broad subject  astrophysicists typically apply many disciplines of physics  including mechanics  electromagnetism  statistical mechanics  thermodynamics  quantum mechanics  relativity  nuclear and particle physics  and atomic and molecular physics  The discovery by Karl Jansky in 1931 that radio signals were emitted by celestial bodies initiated the science of radio astronomy  Most recently  the frontiers of astronomy have been expanded by space exploration  Perturbations and interference from the earth s atmosphere make space based observations necessary for infrared  ultraviolet  gamma ray  and X ray astronomy  Physical cosmology is the study of the formation and evolution of the universe on its largest scales  Albert Einstein s theory of relativity plays a central role in all modern cosmological theories  In the early 20th century  Hubble s discovery that the universe was expanding  as shown by the Hubble diagram  prompted rival explanations known as the steady state universe and the Big Bang  The Big Bang was confirmed by the success of Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the discovery of the cosmic microwave background in 1964  The Big Bang model rests on two theoretical pillars  Albert Einstein s general relativity and the cosmological principle  Cosmologists have recently established the  CDM model of the evolution of the universe  which includes cosmic inflation  dark energy and dark matter  Numerous possibilities and discoveries are anticipated to emerge from new data from the Fermi Gamma ray Space Telescope over the upcoming decade and vastly revise or clarify existing models of the Universe  36  37  In particular  the potential for a tremendous discovery surrounding dark matter is possible over the next several years  38  Fermi will search for evidence that dark matter is composed of weakly interacting massive particles  complementing similar experiments with the Large Hadron Collider and other underground detectors  IBEX is already yielding new astrophysical discoveries   No one knows what is creating the ENA  energetic neutral atoms  ribbon  along the termination shock of the solar wind   but everyone agrees that it means the textbook picture of the heliosphere   in which the solar system s enveloping pocket filled with the solar wind s charged particles is plowing through the onrushing  galactic wind  of the interstellar medium in the shape of a comet   is wrong   39  Current research Further information  List of unsolved problems in physics Feynman diagram signed by R  P  Feynman A typical event described by physics  a magnet levitating above a superconductor demonstrates the Meissner effect  Research in physics is continually progressing on a large number of fronts  In condensed matter physics  an important unsolved theoretical problem is that of high temperature superconductivity  Many condensed matter experiments are aiming to fabricate workable spintronics and quantum computers  In particle physics  the first pieces of experimental evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model have begun to appear  Foremost among these are indications that neutrinos have non zero mass  These experimental results appear to have solved the long standing solar neutrino problem  and the physics of massive neutrinos remains an area of active theoretical and experimental research  Particle accelerators have begun probing energy scales in the TeV range  in which experimentalists are hoping to find evidence for the Higgs boson and supersymmetric particles  40  Theoretical attempts to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity into a single theory of quantum gravity  a program ongoing for over half a century  have not yet been decisively resolved  The current leading candidates are M theory  superstring theory and loop quantum gravity  Many astronomical and cosmological phenomena have yet to be satisfactorily explained  including the existence of ultra high energy cosmic rays  the baryon asymmetry  the acceleration of the universe and the anomalous rotation rates of galaxies  Although much progress has been made in high energy  quantum  and astronomical physics  many everyday phenomena involving complexity  chaos  or turbulence are still poorly understood  citation needed  Complex problems that seem like they could be solved by a clever application of dynamics and mechanics remain unsolved  examples include the formation of sandpiles  nodes in trickling water  the shape of water droplets  mechanisms of surface tension catastrophes  and self sorting in shaken heterogeneous collections  citation needed  These complex phenomena have received growing attention since the 1970s for several reasons  including the availability of modern mathematical methods and computers  which enabled complex systems to be modeled in new ways  Complex physics has become part of increasingly interdisciplinary research  as exemplified by the study of turbulence in aerodynamics and the observation of pattern formation in biological systems  In 1932  Horace Lamb said  41  I am an old man now  and when I die and go to heaven there are two matters on which I hope for enlightenment  One is quantum electrodynamics  and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids  And about the former I am rather optimistic  See also Physics portal Book  Physics Wikipedia books are collections of articles that

unlocking the secrets of the universe  The sign above the Academy entrance read   Let no one ignorant of geometry enter here        Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes  I mean the universe  but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which it is written  This book is written in the mathematical language  and the symbols are triangles  circles and other geometrical figures  without whose help it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word of it  and without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth     Galileo  1623   The Assayer  as quoted by G  Toraldo Di Francia  1976   The Investigation of the Physical World ISBN 0 521 29925 X p 10    Applications of Mathematics to the Sciences

mathematical methods suitable for such applications and for the formulation of physical theories   Definition from the Journal of Mathematical Physics  http   jmp aip org jmp staff jsp   American Association for the Advancement of Science  Science  1917  Page 645   a b The Feynman Lectures on Physics Volume I  Feynman  Leighton and Sands  ISBN 0 201 02115 3 See Chapter 3    The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences  for a general discussion  For the philosophical issue of whether other sciences can be  reduced  to physics  see reductionism and special sciences     Some principles  such as Newton s laws of motion  are still generally called  laws  even though they are now known to be limiting cases of newer theories  Thus  for example  in Thomas Brody  1993  Luis de la Pe a and Peter Hodgson  eds   The Philosophy Behind Physics ISBN 0 387 55914 0  pp 18 24  Chapter 2   explains the  epistemic cycle  in which a student of physics discovers that physics is not a finished product but is instead the process of creating  that product     See  for example  the influence of Kant and Ritter on Oersted    Concepts which are denoted hypothetical can change with time  For example  the atom of nineteenth century physics was denigrated by some  including Ernst Mach s critique of Ludwig Boltzmann s formulation of statistical mechanics  By the end of World War II  the atom was no longer deemed hypothetical    Feynman  Richard  1965   The Character of Physical Law  ISBN 0262560038   p 157   In fact experimenters have a certain individual character  They     very often do their experiments in a region in which people know the theorist has not made any guesses      Yet  universalism is encouraged in the culture of physics  For example  the World Wide Web  which was innovated at CERN by Tim Berners Lee  was created in service to the computer infrastructure of CERN  and was is intended for use by physicists worldwide  The same might be said for arXiv org    Division of
