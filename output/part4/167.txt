commonly known as Saudi Arabia  in British English as  i  sa di   re bi   or in American English as i  s  di    re bi     is the largest state in Western Asia by land area  constituting the bulk of the Arabian Peninsula  and the second largest in the Arab world  after Algeria  It is bordered by Jordan  and Iraq on the north and northeast  Kuwait  Qatar and the United Arab Emirates on the east  Oman on the southeast  and Yemen on the south  The Red Sea lies to its west  and the Persian Gulf lies to the northeast  Saudi Arabia has an area of approximately 2 149 690 km2  830 000 sq mi   and it has an estimated population of 27 million  of which 8 8 million are registered foreign expatriates and an estimated 1 5 million are illegal immigrants  Saudi nationals comprise an estimated 16 million people  7  The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded by Abdul Aziz bin Saud  known for most of his career as Ibn Saud  in 1932  although the conquests which eventually led to the creation of the Kingdom began in 1902 when he captured Riyadh  the ancestral home of his family  the House of Saud  referred to in Arabic as the Al Saud  The Saudi Arabian government  which has been an absolute monarchy since its inception  refers to its system of government as being Islamic  though this is contested by many due to its strong basis in Salafism  a minority school of thought in Islam  The kingdom is sometimes called  The Land of the Two Holy Mosques  in reference to Al Masjid al Haram  in Mecca   and Al Masjid al Nabawi  in Medina   the two holiest places in Islam  Saudi Arabia has the world s second largest oil reserves and is the world s second largest oil exporter  8  Oil accounts for more than 90  of exports and nearly 75  of government revenues  facilitating the creation of a welfare

Su  d yah  a transliteration of                          in Arabic  by royal decree on 23 September 1932 by its founder  King Abdul Aziz Al Saud  This is normally translated as  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  in English  10  although it literally means  the Saudi Arab Kingdom   11  The word  Saudi  is derived from the element as Su  d yah in the Arabic name of the country  which is a type of adjective known as a nisba  formed from the dynastic name of Al Saud            Its inclusion indicated that the country s ruler viewed it as the personal possession of the royal family  12  13 Al Saud is an Arabic name formed by adding the word Al  meaning  family of  or  House of   14  to the personal name of an ancestor  In the case of the Al Saud  this is the father of the dynasty s 18th century founder  Muhammad bin Saud  Muhammad  son of Saud   15  For the etymology of Arabia  see Arabian Peninsula and Arab  etymology    edit  History Main article  History of Saudi Arabia  edit  From the earliest times to the foundation of Saudi Arabia See also  Unification of Saudi Arabia The Ottoman Empire in 1914  including nominal and vassal Ottoman territories   the position in Arabia had largely been the same for the previous 400 years In Pre Islamic Arabia  apart from a small number of urban trading settlements  such as Mecca and Medina  located in the Hejaz in the west of the Arabian Peninsula  most of what was to become Saudi Arabia was populated by nomadic tribal societies in the uninhabitable desert  16  The Prophet of Islam  Muhammad  was born in Mecca in about 571  In the early 7th century  Muhammad united the various tribes of the peninsula and created a single Islamic religious polity  Following his death in 632  his followers rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim rule beyond Arabia  conquering huge swathes of territory  from the Iberian Peninsula to India  in a matter of decades  In so doing  Arabia soon became a politically peripheral region of the Muslim world as the focus shifted to the more developed conquered lands  17  From the 10th century to the early 20th century Mecca and Medina were under the control of a local Arab ruler known as the Sharif of Mecca  but at most times the Sharif owed allegiance to the ruler of one of the major Islamic empires based in Baghdad  Cairo or Istanbul  Most of the remainder of what became Saudi Arabia reverted to traditional tribal rule  18  19  In the 16th century  the Ottomans added the Red Sea and Persian Gulf coast  the Hejaz  Asir and Al Hasa  to their Empire and claimed suzerainty over the interior  The degree of control over these lands varied over the next four centuries with the fluctuating strength or weakness of the Empire s central authority  20  21  The emergence of what was to become the Saudi royal family  known as the Al Saud  began in Nejd in central Arabia in 1744  when Muhammad bin Saud  founder of the dynasty  joined forces with the religious leader Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab  22  movement a strict puritanical form of Sunni Islam  23  This alliance formed in the 18th century provided the ideological impetus to Saudi expansion and remains the basis of Saudi Arabian dynastic rule today  24  The first  Saudi State  established in 1744 in the area around Riyadh  rapidly expanded and briefly controlled most of the present day territory of Saudi Arabia  but was destroyed by 1818 by the Ottoman viceroy of Egypt  Mohammed Ali Pasha  A much smaller second  Saudi state   located mainly in Nejd  was established in 1824  Throughout the rest of the 19th century  the Al Saud contested control of the interior of what was to become Saudi Arabia with another Arabian ruling family  the Al Rashid  By 1891  the Al Rashid were victorious and the Al Saud were driven into exile  25  At the beginning of the 20th century  the Ottoman Empire continued to control or have suzerainty  albeit nominal  over most of the peninsula  Subject to this suzerainty  Arabia was ruled by a patchwork of tribal rulers 26  27   including the House of Saud who had returned from exile in 1902 25   with the Sharif of Mecca having pre eminence and ruling the Hejaz  28  In 1916  with the encouragement and support of Britain  which was fighting the Ottomans in World War I   the Sharif of Mecca  Hussein bin Ali  led a pan Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire to create a united Arab state  29  Although the Arab Revolt of 1916 to 1918 failed in its objective  Arabia was freed from Ottoman suzerainty and control by the latter s defeat in World War I  30  Arabia about 1923  Expandable map  Abdul Aziz s domain is in blue with dates of conquest  The Kingdom of the Hejaz  conquered in 1925  is in light green   The other Hashemite kingdoms of Iraq and Transjordan are also in shades of green  In 1902  Abdul Aziz bin Saud  leader of the House of Saud  had seized Riyadh in Nejd from the Al Rashid   the first of a series of conquests ultimately leading to the creation of the modern state of Saudi Arabia in 1932  25  The main weapon for achieving these conquests was the Ikhwan  the Wahhabist Bedouin tribal army led by Sultan ibn Bijad and Faisal Al Dawish  31  From the Saudi core in Nejd  and aided by the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I  the Ikhwan had completed the conquest of the territory that was to become Saudi Arabia by the end of 1925  32  On 10 January 1926 Abdul Aziz declared himself King of the Hejaz and  then  on 27 January 1927 he took the title of King of Nejd  his previous title having been  Sultan    25  After the conquest of the Hejaz  the Ikhwan leaders wanted to continue the expansion of the Wahhabist realm into the British protectorates of Transjordan  Iraq and Kuwait  and began raiding those territories  Abdul Aziz  however  refused to agree to this  recognizing the danger of a direct conflict with the British  The Ikhwan therefore revolted but were defeated in the Battle of Sabilla in 1930  where the Ikhwan leadership were massacred  33  In 1932  the two kingdoms of the Hejaz and Nejd were united as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  25   edit  From the foundation of the State to the present The new kingdom was one of the poorest countries in the world  reliant on limited agriculture and pilgrimage revenues  34  However  in 1938 vast reserves of oil were discovered in the Al Hasa region along the coast of the Persian Gulf and full scale development of the oil fields began in 1941  Oil provided Saudi Arabia with economic prosperity and substantial political leverage internationally  Cultural life rapidly developed  primarily in the Hejaz  which was the center for newspapers and radio  But the large influx of foreigners to work in the oil industry increased the pre existing propensity for xenophobia  At the same time  the government became increasingly wasteful and extravagant  By the 1950s this had led to large governmental deficits and excessive foreign borrowing  25  Abdul Aziz bin Saud first king of Saudi Arabia King Saud succeeded to the throne on his father s death in 1953  However  an intense rivalry between the King and his half brother  Prince Faisal emerged  fueled by doubts in the royal family over Saud s competence  As a consequence  Saud was deposed in favor of Faisal in 1964  The major event of King Faisal s reign was the 1973 oil crisis  when Saudi Arabia  and the other Arab oil producers  tried to put pressure on the US to withdraw support from Israel through an oil embargo  25  Faisal was assassinated in 1975 by his nephew  Prince Faisal bin Musaid  35  Faisal was succeeded by his half brother King Khalid during whose reign economic and social development progressed at an extremely rapid rate  transforming the infrastructure and educational system of the country  25  in foreign policy  close ties with the US were developed  35  In 1979  two events occurred which greatly concerned the Al Saud regime  36  and had a long term influence on Saudi foreign and domestic policy  The first was the Iranian Islamic Revolution  It was feared that the country s Shi ite minority in the Eastern Province  which is also the location of the oil fields  might rebel under the influence of their Iranian co religionists  In fact  there were several anti government uprisings in the region in 1979 and 1980  The second event  was the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Islamist extremists  The militants involved were in part angered by what they considered to be the corruption and un Islamic nature of the Saudi regime  37  Part of the response of the royal family was to enforce a much stricter observance of traditional religious and social norms in the country  for example  the closure of cinemas  and to give the Ulema a greater role in government  38  Neither entirely succeeded as Islamism continued to grow in strength  39  The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia after unification in 1932 Khalid was succeeded by his brother King Fahd in 1982 who continued the close relationship with the United States and increased the purchase of American and British military equipment  25  From 1976 Saudi Arabia had become the largest oil producer in the world  40  The Saudi regime spent  25 billion in support of Saddam Hussein in the Iran Iraq War  41  The vast wealth generated by oil revenues and channeled through the government had a profound impact on Saudi society  It led to urbanization  mass public education  and the creation of new media  This and the presence of large numbers of foreign workers greatly affected traditional Saudi norms and values  Although there was dramatic change in the social and economic life of the country  political power continued to be monopolized by the royal family 25  leading to discontent among many Saudis who began to look for wider participation in government  42  Following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 Saudi Arabia joined the anti Iraq Coalition  King Fahd  fearing an attack from Iraq  invited American and coalition soldiers to be stationed in Saudi Arabia  25  This action concerned some of the ulema and students of sharia law and was one of the issues that led to an increase in Islamic terrorism in Saudi Arabia  as well as Islamic terrorist attacks in Western countries by Saudi nationals   the 9 11 attacks in New York being the most prominent example  43  But also many Saudis who did not necessarily support the Islamist terrorists were deeply unhappy with the government stance  44  Islamism was not the only source of hostility to the regime  Although now extremely wealthy  the country s economy was near stagnant  which  combined with high taxes and a growth in unemployment  contributed to disquiet in the country  and was reflected in a subsequent rise in civil unrest  and discontent with the royal family  In response  a number of limited  reforms  were initiated  such as the Basic Law   However  the royal family s intent was to respond to dissent while making as few actual changes in the status quo as possible  Fahd made it clear that he did not have democracy in mind   A system based on elections is not consistent with our Islamic creed  which  approves of  government by consultation  sh r     25  In 1995  Fahd suffered a debilitating stroke and the Crown Prince  Prince Abdullah assumed the role of acting King  albeit his authority was hindered by conflict with Fahd s full brothers  known  with Fahd  as the  Sudairi Seven    45 Abdullah continued the policy of mild reform and greater openness  46  but in addition  adopted a foreign policy distancing the kingdom from the US  In 2003  Saudi Arabia refused to support the US and its allies in the invasion of Iraq  25  However  terrorist activity increased dramatically in 2003  with the Riyadh compound bombings and other attacks  which prompted the government to take much more stringent action against terrorism  47  In 2005  King Fahd died and his half brother  Abdullah ascended to the throne  The king subsequently introduced a new program of moderate reform which included a number of economic reforms aimed at reducing the country s reliance on oil revenue  limited deregulation  encouragement of foreign investment  and privatization  He has taken much more vigorous action to deal with the origins of Islamic terrorism  and has ordered the use of force for the first time by the security services against some extremists  In February 2009  Abdullah announced a series of governmental changes to the judiciary  armed forces  and various ministries to modernize these institutions including the replacement of senior appointees in the judiciary and the Mutaween  religious police  with more moderate indiviuals and the appointment of the country s first female deputy minister  25  In early 2011  King Abdullah indicated his opposition to the protests and revolutions affecting the Arab world by giving asylum to deposed President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia and by telephoning President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt  prior to his deposition  to offer his support  48  Saudi Arabia has also been affected by its own protests  49  In response  King Abdullah announced a series of benefits for citizens amounting to  10 7 billion  These included funding to offset high inflation and to aid young unemployed people and Saudi citizens studying abroad  as well as the writing off of some loans  State employees will see their incomes increase by 15 per cent  and additional cash has also been made available for housing loans  No political reforms were announced as part of the package  though some prisoners indicted for financial crimes were pardoned  50   edit  Politics Main article  Politics of Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy  51  although  according to the Basic Law of Saudi Arabia adopted by royal decree in 1992  the king must comply with Sharia  that is  Islamic law  and the Quran  The Quran and the Sunnah  the traditions of Muhammad  are declared to be the country s constitution  but no written modern constitution has ever been written for Saudi Arabia  and Saudi Arabia remains the only Arab Nation where no national elections have ever taken place  since its creation  52  No political parties or national elections are permitted 51  and according to The Economist s 2010 Democracy Index  the Saudi government is the seventh most authoritarian regime from among the 167 countries rated  53  On 25 September 2011  Saudi Arabia s King Abdullah has announced that women will have the right to stand and vote in future local elections and join the advisory Shura council as full member and be able to run as candidates in the municipal election  54   edit  Monarchy and royal family The king combines legislative  executive  and judicial functions 55  and royal decrees to form the basis of the country s legislation  56  The king is also the prime minister  and presides over the Council of Ministers  Majlis al Wuzar     which comprises the first and second deputy prime  The royal family dominates the political system  The family s vast numbers allow it to control most of the kingdom s important posts and to have an involvement and presence at all levels of government  57  The number of princes is estimated to be at least 7 000  with most power and influence being wielded by the 200 or so male descendants of King Abdul Aziz  58  The key ministries are generally reserved for the royal family  51  as are the thirteen regional governorships  59  Long term political and government appointments  such as those of King Abdullah  who had been Commander of the National Guard since 1963  until 2010  when he appointed his son to replace him 60    Crown Prince Sultan  Minister of Defence  amp  Aviation since 1962  Prince Nayef who has been the Minister of Interior since 1975  Prince Saud who has been Minister of Foreign Affairs since 1975 61  and Prince Salman  who has been Governor of the Riyadh Region since 1962  62  have resulted in the creation of  power fiefdoms  for senior princes  63  The Saudi government and the royal family have often  over many years  been accused of corruption  64  In a country that is said to  belong  to the royal family and is named for them  13  the lines between state assets and the personal wealth of senior princes are blurred  58  The extent of corruption has been described as systemic 65  and endemic  66  and its existence was acknowledged 67  and defended 68  by Prince Bandar bin Sultan  a senior member of the royal family 69   in an interview in 2001  70  Although corruption allegations have often been limited to broad undocumented accusations  71  specific allegations were made in 2007  when it was claimed that the British defence contractor BAE Systems had paid Prince Bandar US 2 billion in bribes relating to the Al Yamamah arms deal  72  Prince Bandar denied the allegations  73  Investigations by both US and UK authorities resulted  in 2010  in plea bargain agreements with the company  by which it paid  447 million in fines but did not admit to bribery  74 Transparency International in its annual Corruption Perceptions Index for 2010 gave Saudi Arabia a score of 4 7  on a scale from 0 to 10 where 0 is  highly corrupt  and 10 is  highly clean    75  Since the 9 11 attacks in 2001  there has been mounting pressure to reform and modernize the royal family s rule  an agenda championed by King Abdullah both before and after his accession in 2005  The creation of the Consultative Council in the early 1990s did not satisfy demands for political participation  and  in 2003  an annual National Dialogue Forum was announced that would allow selected professionals and intellectuals to publicly debate current national issues  within certain prescribed parameters  In 2005  the first municipal elections were held  In 2007  the Allegiance Council was created to regulate the succession  76  In 2009  the king made significant personnel changes to the government by appointing reformers to key positions and the first woman to a ministerial post  77  However  the changes have been criticized as being too slow or merely cosmetic  78  and the royal family is reportedly divided on the speed and direction of reform  79   edit  The Al ash Sheikh and the political role of the ulema Saudi Arabia is almost unique in giving the ulema  the body of Islamic religious leaders and jurists  a direct role in government  80  the only other example being Iran  81  The ulema have also been a key influence in major government decisions  for example the imposition of the oil embargo in 1973 and the invitation to foreign troops to Saudi Arabia in 1990  82  In addition  they have had a major role in the judicial and education systems 83  and a monopoly of authority in the sphere of religious and social morals  84  Abdul Aziz ibn Abdullah Al ash Sheikh  Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia  the country s most senior religious authority  85  By the 1970s  as a result of oil wealth and the modernization of the country initiated by King Faisal  important changes to Saudi society were under way and the power of the ulema was in decline  86  However  this changed following the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca in 1979 by Islamist radicals  87  The government s response to the crisis included strengthening the ulema s powers and increasing their financial support  38  in particular  they were given greater control over the education system 87  and allowed to enforce stricter observance of Wahhabi rules of moral and social behaviour  38  Since his accession to the throne in 2005  King Abdullah has taken steps to rein back the powers of the ulema  for instance transferring their control over girls  education to the Ministry of Education  88  The ulema have historically been led by the Al ash Sheikh  89  the country s leading religious family  84  The Al ash Sheikh are the descendants of Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab  the 18th century founder of the Wahhabi form of Sunni Islam which is today dominant in Saudi Arabia  90  The family is second in prestige only to the Al Saud  the royal family  91  with whom they formed a  mutual support pact  92  and power sharing arrangement nearly 300 years ago  82  The pact  which persists to this day  92  is based on the Al Saud maintaining the Al ash Sheikh s authority in religious matters and upholding and propagating Wahhabi doctrine  In return  the Al ash Sheikh support the Al Saud s political authority  93  thereby using its religious moral authority to legitimize the royal family s rule  94  Although the Al ash Sheikh s domination of the ulema has diminished in recent decades  95  they still hold the most important religious posts and are closely linked to the Al Saud by a high degree of intermarriage  84   edit  Political process and opposition See also  Terrorism in Saudi Arabia and List of militant incidents in Saudi Arabia In the absence of national elections and political parties  51  politics in Saudi Arabia takes place in two distinct arenas  within the royal family  the Al Saud  and between the royal family and the rest of Saudi society  96  The royal family is politically divided by factions based on clan loyalties  personal ambitions and ideological differences  96  The most powerful clan faction is known as the  Sudairi Seven   comprising the late King Fahd and his full brothers and their descendants  97  Ideological divisions include issues over the speed and direction of reform  79  and whether the role of the ulema should be increased or reduced  There are also divisions within the family over who should succeed to the throne after the accession or earlier death of Prince Sultan  the current Crown Prince  has occurred  97  98  Outside of the Al Saud  participation in the political process is limited to a relatively small segment of the population and takes the form of the royal family consulting with the ulema  tribal sheikhs and members of important commercial families on major decisions  55  This process is not reported by the Saudi media  99  In theory  all males of full age have a right to petition the king directly through the traditional tribal meeting known as the majlis  100  In many ways the approach to government differs little from the traditional system of tribal rule  Tribal identity remains strong and  outside of the royal family  political influence is frequently determined by tribal affiliation  with tribal sheikhs maintaining a considerable degree of influence over local and national events  55  As mentioned earlier  in recent years there have been limited steps to widen political participation such as the establishment of the Consultative Council in the early 1990s and the National Dialogue Forum in 2003  76  The rule of the Al Saud faces political opposition from four sources  Sunni Islamist activism  liberal critics  the underground Green Party of Saudi Arabia  the Shi ite minority   particularly in the Eastern Province  and long standing tribal and regional particularistic opponents  for example in the Hejaz   101  Of these  the Islamic activists have been the most prominent threat to the regime and have in recent years perpetrated a number of violent or terrorist acts in the country  47  However  open protest against the government  even if peaceful  is not tolerated  On 29 January 2011  hundreds of protesters gathered in the city of Jeddah in a rare display of criticism against the city s poor infrastructure after deadly floods swept through the city  killing eleven people  102  Police stopped the demonstration after about 15 minutes and arrested 30 to 50 people  103  As part of the wave of protests and revolutions affecting the Middle East and North Africa in early 2011  a number of incidents and protests occurred in Saudi Arabia  See 2011 Saudi Arabian protests for further details   edit  Law and human rights Main article  Legal system of Saudi Arabia See also  Human rights in Saudi Arabia Verses from the Quran  The Quran is the official constitution of the country and a primary source of law  Arabia is unique in enshrining a religious text as a political document 104  The primary source of law is the Islamic Sharia derived from the teachings of the Qu ran and the Sunnah  the traditions of the Prophet   56  Sharia is not codified and there is no system of judicial precedent  Saudi judges tend to follow the principles of the Hanbali school of jurisprudence  or fiqh  found in pre modern texts 105  and noted for its literalist interpretation of the Qu ran and hadith  106  Nevertheless  because the judge is empowered to disregard previous judgments  either his own or of other judges  and will apply his personal interpretation of Sharia to any particular case  divergent judgements arise even in apparently identical cases  107  Royal decrees are the other main source of law but are referred to as regulations rather than laws because they are subordinate to the Sharia  56  Royal decrees supplement Sharia in areas such as labor  commercial and corporate law  Additionally  traditional tribal law and custom remain significant  108  The Sharia court system constitutes the basic judiciary of Saudi Arabia and its judges and lawyers form part of the ulema  the country s religious leadership  However  there are also extra Sharia government tribunals which handle disputes relating to specific royal decrees  109  Final appeal from both Sharia courts and government tribunals is to the King and all courts and tribunals follow Sharia rules of evidence and procedure  110  The Saudi system of justice has been criticized for being slow  arcane  111  lacking in some of the safeguards of justice and unable to deal with the modern world  112  In 2007  King Abdullah issued royal decrees reforming the judiciary and creating a new court system  although the reforms have yet to be implemented  107  The capabilities and reactionary nature of the judges have  in particular  been criticized 113  and  in 2009  the King made a number of significant changes to the judiciary s personnel at the most senior level by bringing in a younger generation  111  Saudi Arabia has long been criticized for its human rights record  with Western based organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch condemning both the criminal justice system and its severe punishments  However  most Saudis reportedly support the system and say that it maintains a low crime rate  114  There are no jury trials in Saudi Arabia and courts observe few formalities  115  Human Rights Watch  in a 2008 report  noted that a criminal procedure code had been introduced for the first time in 2002  but it lacked some basic protections and  in any case  had been routinely ignored by judges  Those arrested are often not informed of the crime of which they are accused or given access to a lawyer and are subject to abusive treatment and torture if they do not confess  At trial  there is a presumption of guilt and the accused is often unable to examine witnesses and evidence or present a legal defense  Most trials are held in secret  116  Deera Square  central Riyadh  Known locally as  Chop chop square   it is the location of public beheadings  117  The physical punishments imposed by Saudi courts  such as beheading  stoning  amputation and lashing  and the number of executions have been strongly criticized  118  The death penalty can be imposed for a wide range of offences including murder  rape  armed robbery  repeated drug use  apostasy  adultery  witchcraft and sorcery and can be carried out by beheading with a sword  stoning or firing squad  followed by crucifixion  119  120  The 345 reported executions between 2007 and 2010 were all carried out by public beheading  The last reported execution for sorcery took place in 2011 121  and three subsequent convictions for witchcraft did not result in execution  Although repeated theft can be punishable by amputation of the right hand  only one instance of judicial amputation was reported between 2007 and 2010  Gay rights are not recognised  Homosexual acts are punishable by flogging or death  119  122  Lashings are a common form of punishment 123  and are often imposed for offences

human rights conventions and  in 2004  the government approved the establishment of the National Society for Human Rights  NSHR   staffed by government employees  to monitor their implementation  To date  the activities of the NSHR have been limited and doubts remain over its neutrality and independence  125  Saudi Arabia remains one of the very few countries in the world not to accept the UN s

 overseas development aid   131  However  there is evidence that the vast majority was  in fact  spent on propagating and extending the influence of Wahhabism at the expense of other forms of Islam  132  There has been an intense debate over whether Saudi aid and Wahhabism has fomented extremism in recipient countries  133  The two main allegations are that  by its nature  Wahhabism encourages intolerance and promotes terrorism  134  Former CIA director James Woolsey described it as  the soil in which Al Qaeda and its sister terrorist organizations are flourishing   135  However  the Saudi government strenuously denies these claims or that it exports religious or cultural extremism  136  In the Arab and Muslim worlds  Saudi Arabia is considered to be pro Western and pro American  137  and it is certainly a long term ally of the United States  138  However  this 139  and Saudi Arabia s role in the 1991 Gulf War  particularly the stationing of U S  troops on Saudi soil from 1991  prompted the development of a hostile Islamist response internally  140  As a result  Saudi Arabia has  to some extent  distanced itself from the U S  and  for example  refused to support or to

fifth of the world s proven total petroleum reserves  159  The government is attempting to promote growth in the private sector by privatizing industries such as power and telecommunications  Saudi Arabia announced plans to begin privatizing the electricity companies in 1999  which followed the ongoing privatization of the telecommunications company  Shortages of water and rapid population growth may constrain government efforts to increase self sufficiency in agricultural products  In the 1990s  Saudi Arabia experienced a significant contraction of oil revenues combined with a high rate of population growth  Per capita income fell from a high of  11 700 at the height of the oil boom in 1981 to  6 300 in 1998  160 Increases in oil prices since 2000 have helped boost per capita

the population is settled  due to rapid economic and urban growth  As recently as the early 1960s  the Saudi Arabia s slave population was estimated at 300 000  167 Slavery was officially abolished in 1962  168  169  The official language of Saudi Arabia is Arabic  The three main regional variants spoken by Saudis are Hejazi Arabic  about 6 million speakers   Nejdi Arabic  about 8 million speakers

Arabia  They are not allowed to hold or even apply for Saudi citizenship  because of Arab League instructions barring the Arab states from granting them citizenship  Palestinians are the sole foreign group that cannot benefit from a 2004 law passed by Saudi Arabia s Council of Ministers  which entitles expatriates of all nationalities who have resided in the kingdom for ten years to apply for citizenship with priority being given to holders of degrees in various scientific fields  174  The Articles 12 4 and 14 1 of the Executive Regulation of Saudi Citizenship System can be interpreted as requiring applicants to be Muslim  175  In a 2011 news story  Arab News reported   Nearly three million expatriate workers will have to leave the Kingdom in the next few years as the Labor Ministry has put a 20 percent ceiling on the country s guest workers   176   edit  Social issues Saudi society has a number of issues and tensions  A rare independent opinion poll published in 2010 indicated that Saudis  main social concerns were unemployment  at 10  in 2010 177    corruption and religious extremism  178  179  Crime is not a significant problem  148  However  Saudi Arabia s objective of being both a modern and Islamic country  coupled with economic difficulties  has created deep social tensions  including the following  Connections to the West have caused some Saudis to desire the overthrow of the Al Saud  Others want a reformed and more open government and to have more influence in the political process  On the other hand  juvenile delinquency  drug use and use of alcohol are getting worse  High unemployment and a generation of young males filled with contempt toward the Royal Family is a significant threat to Saudi social stability  Some Saudis feel they are entitled to well paid government jobs  and the failure of the government to satisfy this sense of entitlement has led to considerable dissatisfaction  180  181  182  Additionally  the Shiite minority  located primarily in the Eastern Province  and who often complain of institutionalized inequality and repression  have created civil disturbances in the past  Terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia have made it clear that Saudi Arabia does harbor indigenous terrorists  181  According to a 2009 U S  State Department communication by Hillary Clinton  United States Secretary of State   disclosed as part of the Wikileaks U S   cables leaks  controversy in 2010   donors in Saudi Arabia constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide   183  Part of this funding arises through the zakat  An act of charity dictated by Islam  paid by all Saudis to charities  and amounting to at least 2 5 percent of their income  Although many charities are genuine  others  it is alleged  serve as fronts for money laundering and terrorist financing operations  While many Saudis contribute to those charities in good faith believing their money goes toward good causes  it has been alleged that others know full well the terrorist purposes to which their money will be applied  135  According to a study conducted by Dr  Nura Al Suwaiyan  director of the family safety program at the National Guard Hospital  one in four children are abused in Saudi Arabia  184  The National Society for Human Rights reports that almost 45  of the country s children are facing some sort of abuse and domestic violence  185  It has also been claimed that trafficking of women is a particular problem in Saudi Arabia as the country s large number of female foreign domestic workers and loopholes in the system cause many to fall victim to abuse and torture  186  Widespread inbreeding in Saudi Arabia  resulting from the traditional practice of encouraging marriage between close relatives  has produced high levels of several genetic disorders including thalassemia  sickle cell anemia  spinal muscular atrophy  deafness and muteness  187  188  Reporting of poverty remains a state taboo  In December 2011  days after the Arab Spring uprisings  the Saudi interior ministry detained reporter Feros Boqna and two colleagues and held them for almost two weeks for questioning after they uploaded a video on the topic to YouTube  189  190  Statistics on the issue are not available through the UN resources because the Saudi government does not issue poverty figures  191  Observers researching the issue prefer to stay anonymous  192  because of the risk of being arrested  Three journalists  Feras Boqna  Hussam al Drewesh and Khaled al Rasheed were detained after posting 10 minute film  Mal3ob 3alena   or  We are being cheated  193  on Saudis living in poverty to YouTube  194  Authors of the video claim that 22  of Saudis are considered to be poor  2009  and

daughters of Allah along with Man t and al  Uzz   The tomb of Muhammad in Medina There are about 25 million people who are Muslim  or 97  of the total population  196  Data for Saudi Arabia comes primarily from general population surveys  which are less reliable than censuses or large scale demographic and health surveys for estimating minority majority ratios  196  About 85 90  of Saudis are Sunni  while Shias represent around 10 15  of the Muslim population  197  The official and dominant form of Sunni Islam in Saudi Arabia is commonly known as Wahhabism  a name which some of its proponents consider derogatory  preferring the term Salafism 198    founded in the Arabian peninsular by Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab in the eighteenth century  is often described as  puritanical    intolerant  or  ultra conservative   However  proponents consider that its teachings seek to purify the practise of Islam of any innovations or practices that deviate from the seventh century teachings of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad and his companions 199  In 2010  the U S  State Department stated that in Saudi Arabia  freedom of religion is neither recognized nor protected under the law and is severely restricted in practice  and that  government policies continued to place severe restrictions on religious freedom   200  No faith other than Islam is permitted to be practised  although there are nearly a million Christians   nearly all foreign workers   in Saudi Arabia  201  There are no churches or other non Muslim houses of worship permitted in the country  200  Even private prayer services are forbidden in practice and the Saudi religious police reportedly regularly search the homes of Christians  201  Foreign workers have to observe Ramadan but are not allowed to celebrate Christmas or Easter  201 Conversion by Muslims to another religion  apostasy  carries the death penalty  although there have been no confirmed reports of executions for apostasy in recent years  200 Proselytizing by non Muslims is illegal  200  and the last Christian priest was expelled from Saudi Arabia in 1985  201  There are some Hindus in Saudi Arabia  Compensation in court cases discriminates against non Muslims  once fault is determined  a Muslim receives all of the amount of compensation determined  a Jew or Christian half  and all others a sixteenth  201  According to Human Rights Watch  the Shia minority face systematic discrimination from the Saudi government in education  the justice system and especially religious freedom  202  Restrictions are imposed on the public celebration of Shia festivals such as Ashura and on the Shia taking part in communal public worship  203   edit  Women in Saudi society See also  Women s rights in Saudi Arabia A woman wearing a niq b The U S  State department considers that  discrimination against women is a significant problem  in Saudi Arabia and that women have few political or social rights  204  After her 2008 visit  the UN special reporter on violence against women noted the lack of women s autonomy and the absence of a law criminalizing violence against women  204  The World Economic Forum 2010 Global Gender Gap Report ranked Saudi Arabia 129th out of 134 countries for gender parity  205  Every adult woman has to have a close male relative as her  guardian   204  As a result  Human Rights Watch has described the position of Saudi women as no different to being a minor  with little authority over their own lives  206  The guardian is entitled to make a number of critical decisions on a woman s behalf  206  These include giving approval for the woman to travel  to hold some types of business licenses  to study at a university or college and to work if the type of business is not  deemed appropriate for a woman   204  Even where a guardian s approval is not legally required  some officials will still ask for it  207  Women also face discrimination in the courts  where the testimony of one man equals that of two women  and in family and inheritance law  204 Polygamy is permitted for men  208  and men have a unilateral right to divorce their wives  talaq  without needing any legal justification  209  A woman can only obtain a divorce with the consent of her husband or judicially if her husband has harmed her  210  In practice  it is very difficult for a Saudi woman to obtain a judicial divorce  210  With regard to the law of inheritance  the Quran specifies that fixed portions of the deceased s estate must be left to the Qu ranic heirs  211  Generally  female heirs receive half the portion of male heirs  211  A Sunni Muslim can bequeath a maximum of a third of his property to non Qu ranic heirs  The residue is divided between agnatic heirs  211  Cultural norms impose restrictions on women when in public  204  and these are enforced by the religious police  the mutawa  212  They include requiring women to sit in separate specially designated family sections in restaurants  to wear an abaya  a loose fitting  full length black cloak covering the entire body  and to conceal their hair  204  There is also effectively a ban on women driving  213  Men can marry girls as young as ten in Saudi Arabia 214  215 Child marriage is believed to hinder the cause of women s education  The drop out rate of girls increases around puberty  as they exchange education for marriage  Roughly 25  of college aged young women do not attend college  and in 2005 2006  women had a 60  dropout rate  216  Female literacy is estimated to be around 70  compared to male literacy of around 85   2  Leading Saudi feminist and journalist  Wajeha al Huwaider  has said  Saudi women are weak  no matter how high their status  even the  pampered  ones among them  because they have no law to protect them from attack by anyone  The oppression of women and the effacement of their selfhood is a flaw affecting most homes in Saudi Arabia   217  Although many Saudis would like more freedom in Saudi Arabia  there is evidence that many women do not want radical change  218  Even many advocates of reform reject foreign critics  for  failing to understand the uniqueness of Saudi society   219  220  A number of Saudi women have risen to the top of some professions or otherwise achieved prominence  for example Dr  Ghada Al Mutairi  heads a medical research center in California 221  and Dr  Salwa Al Hazzaa  head of the ophthalmology department at King Faisal Specialist Hospital in Riyadh and was the late King Fahad s personal ophthalmologist  222  On 25 September 2011  King Abdullah announced that Saudi women would gain the right to vote  and to be candidates  in municipal elections  following the next round of these elections  However  a male guardian s permission is required in order to vote  223  224   edit  Education Main article  Education in Saudi Arabia Education is free at all levels  The school system is composed of elementary  intermediate  and secondary schools  A large part of the curriculum at all levels is devoted to Islam  and  at the secondary level  students are able to follow either a religious or a technical track  Girls are able to attend school  but fewer girls attend than boys  This disproportion is reflected in the rate of literacy  which exceeds 85 percent among males and is about 70 percent among females  2  Classes are segregated by gender  Higher education has expanded rapidly  with large numbers of Universities and colleges being founded particularly since 2000  Institutions of higher education include the country s first University  King Saud University founded in 1957  the Islamic University at Medina founded in 1961  and the King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah founded in 1967  Other colleges and universities emphasize curricula in sciences and technology  military studies  religion  and medicine  Institutes devoted to Islamic studies  in particular  abound  Women typically receive college instruction in segregated institutions  55  The study of Islam dominates the Saudi educational system  In particular  the memorization by rote of large parts of the Qu ran  its interpretation and understanding  Tafsir  and the application of Islamic tradition to everyday life is at the core of the curriculum  Religion taught in this manner is also a compulsory subject for all University students  225  As a consequence  Saudi youth  generally lacks the education and technical skills the private sector needs  according to the CIA  2  Similarly  The Chronicle of Higher Education wrote in 2010 that  the country needs educated young Saudis with marketable skills and a capacity for innovation and entrepreneurship  That s not generally what Saudi Arabia s educational system delivers  steeped as it is in rote learning and religious instruction   226  A further criticism of the religious focus of the Saudi education system is the nature of the Wahhabi controlled curriculum  The Islamic aspect of the Saudi national curriculum was examined in a 2006 report by Freedom House which concluded that  the Saudi public school religious curriculum continues to propagate an ideology of hate toward the  unbeliever   that is  Christians  Jews  Shiites  Sufis  Sunni Muslims who do not follow Wahhabi doctrine  Hindus  atheists and others  227  228  The Saudi religious studies curriculum is taught outside the Kingdom in madrasah throughout the world  Critics have described the education system as  medieval  and that its primary goal  is to maintain the rule of absolute monarchy by casting it as the ordained protector of the faith  and that Islam is at war with other faiths and cultures   229  The approach taken in the Saudi education system has been accused of encouraging Islamic terrorism  leading to reform efforts  230  To tackle the twin problems of encouraging extremism and the inadequacy of the country s university education for a modern economy  the government is aiming to slowly modernise the education system through the  Tatweer  reform program  230  The Tatweer program is reported to have a budget of approximately US 2 billion and focuses on moving teaching away from the traditional Saudi methods of memorization and rote learning towards encouraging students to analyze and problem solve  It also aims to create an education system which will provide a more secular and vocationally based training  226  231   edit  Culture Main article  Culture of Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia has centuries old attitudes and traditions  often derived from Arab tribal civilization  This culture has been bolstered by the austerely puritanical Wahhabi form of Islam  which arose in the eighteenth century and now predominates in the country  The many limitations on behaviour and dress are strictly enforced both legally and socially  Alcoholic beverages are prohibited  for example  and there is no theatre or public exhibition of films  Public expression of opinion about domestic political or social matters is discouraged  There are no organizations such as political parties or labour unions to provide public forums  Daily life is dominated by Islamic observance  Five times each day  Muslims are called to prayer from the minarets of mosques scattered throughout the country  Because Friday is the holiest day for Muslims  the weekend begins on Thursday  55  232  In accordance with Wahhabi doctrine  only two religious holidays are publicly recognized    d al Fi r and   d al A     Celebration of other Islamic holidays  such as the Prophet s birthday and   sh r    an important holiday for Sh  ites   are tolerated only when celebrated locally and on a small scale  Public observance of non Islamic religious holidays is prohibited  with the exception of September 23  which commemorates the unification of the kingdom  55   edit  Islamic heritage sites See also  Mecca  Medina  and Destruction of early Islamic heritage sites Saudi Arabia  and specifically the Hejaz  as the cradle of Islam  has many of the most significant historic Muslim sites including the two holiest sites of Mecca and Medina  233  One of the King s titles is Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques  the two mosques being Masjid al Haram in Mecca  which contains Islam s most sacred place  the Kaaba  and Al Masjid al Nabawi in Medina which contains Muhammad s tomb  234  235  However  Saudi Wahhabism is hostile to any reverence given to historical or religious places of significance for fear that it may give rise to  shirk   that is  idolatry   As a consequence  under Saudi rule  the Hejaz cities have suffered from considerable destruction of their physical heritage and  for example  it has been estimated that about 95  of Mecca s historic buildings  most over a thousand years old  have been demolished  236  These include the mosque originally built by Muhammad s daughter Fatima  and other mosques founded by Abu Bakr  Muhammad s father in law and the first Caliph   Umar  the second Caliph   Ali  Muhammad s son in law and the fourth Caliph   and Salman al Farsi  another of Muhammad s companions   237  Other historic buildings that have been destroyed include the house of Khadijah  the wife of the Prophet  the house of Abu Bakr  now the site of the local Hilton hotel  the house of Ali Oraid  the grandson of the Prophet  and the Mosque of abu Qubais  now the location of the King s palace in Mecca  238  Critics have described this as  Saudi vandalism  and claim that over the last 50 years 300 historic sites linked to Muhammad  his family or companions have been lost  239  It has been reported that there now are fewer than 20 structures remaining in Mecca that date back to the time of Muhammad  238   edit  Dress Saudi Arabian dress strictly follows the principles of hijab  the Islamic principle of modesty  especially in dress   The predominantly loose and flowing  but covering  garments are suited to Saudi Arabia s desert climate  Traditionally  men usually wear an ankle length shirt woven from wool or cotton  known as a thawb   with a keffiyeh  a large checkered square of cotton held in place by a cord coil  or a ghutra  a plain white square made of finer cotton  also held in place by a cord coil  worn on the head  For rare chilly days  Saudi men wear a camel hair cloak  bisht  over the top  Women s clothes are decorated with tribal motifs  coins  sequins  metallic thread  and appliques  Women are required to wear an abaya or modest clothing when in public  Ghutrah  Arabic         is a traditional headdress typically worn by Arab men  It is made of a square of cloth   scarf    usually cotton  folded and wrapped in various styles around the head  It is commonly worn in areas with an arid climate  to provide protection from direct sun exposure  and also protection of the mouth and eyes from blown dust and sand  Agal  Arabic         is an Arab headdress constructed of cord which is fastened around the Ghutrah to hold it in place  The agal is usually black in colour  Thawb  Arabic        is the standard Arabic word for garment  It is ankle length  usually with long sleeves similar to a robe  Bisht  Arabic        is a traditional Arabic men s cloak usually only worn for prestige on special occasions such as weddings  Abaya  Arabic          is a women s garment  It is a black cloak which loosely covers the entire body except the head  Some women choose to cover their faces with a niq b and some do not   edit  Entertainment  the arts  sport and cuisine Main articles  Cinema of Saudi Arabia  Music of Saudi Arabia  Saudi Arabian cuisine  and Sport in Saudi Arabia During the 1970s  cinemas were numerous in the Kingdom and were not considered un Islamic  although they were seen as contrary to Arab tribal norms  240  During the Islamic revival movement in the 1980s  and as a political response to an increase in Islamist activism including the 1979 seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca  the government closed all cinemas and theaters  However  with King Abdullah s reforms from 2005  some cinemas have re opened  241  From the 18th century onward  Wahhabi fundamentalism discouraged artistic development inconsistent with its teaching  In addition  Sunni Islamic prohibition of creating representations of people have limited the visual arts  which tend to be dominated by geometric  floral  and abstract designs and by calligraphy  With the advent of oil wealth in the 20th century came exposure to outside influences  such as Western housing styles  furnishings  and clothes  Music and dance have always been part of Saudi life  Traditional music is generally associated with poetry and is sung collectively  Instruments include the rab bah  an instrument not unlike a three string fiddle  and various types of percussion instruments  such as the  abl  drum  and the   r  tambourine   Of the native dances  the most popular is a martial line dance known as the  ar ah  which includes lines of men  frequently armed with swords or rifles  dancing to the beat of drums and tambourines  Bedouin poetry  known as naba    is still very popular  55  Censorship has limited the development of Saudi literature  although several Saudi novelists and poets have achieved critical and popular acclaim in the Arab world   albeit generating official hostility in their home country  These include Ghazi Algosaibi  Abdelrahman Munif  Turki al Hamad and Rajaa al Sanea  242  243  244  Football  soccer  is the national sport in Saudi Arabia  citation needed Scuba diving  windsurfing  sailing and basketball are also popular  played by both men and women  with the Saudi Arabian national basketball team winning bronze at the 1999 Asian Championship  245  246  247  More traditional sports such as camel racing became more popular in the 1970s  A stadium in Riyadh holds races in the winter  The annual King s Camel Race  begun in 1974  is one of the sport s most important contests and attracts animals and riders from throughout the region  Falconry  another traditional pursuit  is still practiced  55  Saudi Arabian cuisine is similar to that of the surrounding Arab countries in the Persian Gulf  and has been heavily influenced by Turkish  Persian  and African food  Islamic dietary laws are enforced  pork is not consumed and other animals are slaughtered in accordance with halal  A dish consisting of a stuffed lamb  known as kh z   is the traditional national dish  Kebabs are popular  as is sh warm   shawarma   a marinated grilled meat dish of lamb  mutton  or chicken  As in other Arab countries of the Persian Gulf  machb s  kabsa   a rice dish with fish or shrimp  is popular  Flat  unleavened bread is a staple of virtually every meal  as are dates and fresh fruit  Coffee  served in the Turkish style  is the traditional beverage  55   edit  See also Geography portal Asia portal Middle East portal Saudi Arabia portal Book  Saudi Arabia Wikipedia books are collections of articles that can be
