Website Official website of the Bronx Borough President The Bronx is the northernmost of the five boroughs of New York City  It is also known as Bronx County  the last of the 62 counties of New York State to be incorporated  Located north of Manhattan and Queens  and south of Westchester County  the Bronx is the only borough that is located primarily on the mainland  a very small portion of Manhattan  the Marble Hill neighborhood  is physically located on the mainland  due to the rerouting of the Harlem River in 1897   The Bronx s population is 1 400 761 according to the 2010 United States Census  1  The borough has a land area of 42 square miles  109 km2   making it the fourth largest in land area of the five boroughs  the fourth most populated  and the third highest in density of population  2  3  The Bronx is divided by the Bronx River into a hillier section in the west  closer to Manhattan  and the flatter East Bronx  closer to Long Island  The West Bronx was annexed to New York City  then largely confined to Manhattan  in 1874  and the areas east of the Bronx River in 1895  4  The Bronx first assumed a distinct legal identity when it became a borough of Greater New York in 1898  Bronx County  with the same boundaries as the borough  was separated from New York County  afterwards coextensive with the Borough of Manhattan  as of January 1  1914  5  Although the Bronx is the third most densely populated county in the U S   2  about a quarter of its area is open space  6  including Woodlawn Cemetery  Van Cortlandt Park  Pelham Bay Park  the New York Botanical Garden and the Bronx Zoo in the borough s north and center  on land deliberately reserved in the late 19th century as urban development progressed northwards and eastwards from Manhattan with the building of roads  bridges and railways  The Bronx River was named for Jonas Bronck  who created the first settlement as part of the New Netherland colony in 1639  7  8  9  10  11  and eventually lent its name to the entire borough  The native Lenape were progressively displaced after 1643 by settlers  The Bronx received many Irish  German  Jewish and Italian immigrants as its once rural population exploded between the mid 19th and mid 20th centuries  They were succeeded after 1945 by African Americans and Hispanic Americans from the Caribbean basin   especially Puerto Rico 12  and the Dominican Republic  but also from Jamaica  In recent years  this cultural mix has made the Bronx a wellspring of both Latin music and hip hop  The Bronx contains one of the five poorest Congressional Districts in the U S   the 16th  but its wide variety of neighborhoods also includes the affluent and middle to upper class Riverdale  Schuylerville and Country Club  13  14  The Bronx  particularly the South Bronx  saw a sharp decline in population  livable housing  and the quality of life in the late 1960s and the 1970s  culminating in a wave of arson  but has shown some signs of revival in recent years

Bronx Grand Concourse  amp  161 street at the turn of the century  For generations a rural area of small farms supplying the city markets  the Bronx grew into a railroad suburb in the late 19th century  Faster transportation allowed for rapid population growth in the late 19th century  involving the move from horse drawn street cars to elevated railways to the subway system  which linked to Manhattan in 1904  The great majority lived in rented apartments  The demographic history of the Bronx in the 20th century may be divided into four periods  a boom during 1900 29  with a population growth by a factor of six from 200 000 in 1900 to 1 3 million in 1930  The Great Depression and war years saw a slowing of growth  The 1950s were hard times  as the Bronx decayed 1950 79 from a predominantly middle class to a predominantly lower class area with high rates of crime and poverty  Finally the Bronx has enjoyed economic and demographic stabilization since 1980  17  The South Bronx was for many years a manufacturing center  and in the early part of the 20th Century was noted as a center of piano manufacturing  In 1919  the Bronx was the site of 63 piano factories employing more than 5 000 workers  18  At the end of World War I  the Bronx hosted the rather small 1918 World s Fair at 177th Street and DeVoe Avenue  4  19  The Bronx underwent rapid growth after World War I  Extensions of the New York City Subway contributed to the increase in population as thousands of immigrants flooded The Bronx  resulting in a major boom in residential construction  Among these groups  many Irish Americans  Italian Americans and especially Jewish Americans settled here  In addition  French  German  and Polish immigrants moved into the borough  The Jewish population also increased notably during this time  In 1937  according to Jewish organizations  592 185 Jews lived in The Bronx  43 9  of the borough s population   20  while only 45 000 Jews lived in the borough in 2002  Many synagogues still stand in the Bronx  but most have been converted to other uses  21  In Prohibition days  1920 33   bootleggers and gangs were active in the Bronx  Irish  Italian and Polish gangs smuggled in most of the illegal whiskey  After the 1930s  Irish Americans started moving further north  and German Americans followed suit in the 1940s  as did many Italian Americans in the 1950s and Jews in the 1960s  As the older generation retired  many moved to Florida  The migration has left an African American and Hispanic  mostly Puerto Rican and Dominican  population  along with some Caucasian communities in the far southeastern and northwestern parts of the county  In the 1970s  the Bronx became identified with a high rate of poverty and unemployment  which was mainly a persistent problem in the South Bronx  Some property owners committed arson on their own properties for insurance claims as it was more lucrative to get insurance money than to refurbish or sell a building in a severely distressed area  These Bronx fires and urban decay would paint a face of New York City in the 1970s as a down and out city in a state of decline  Indeed  out of 289 census tracts in the Bronx borough  seven different tracts lost more than 97  of their buildings to fire and abandonment between 1970 and 1980  while another 44 different tracts had more than 50  of their buildings meet the same fate  However  starting in the 1990s  many burned out and run down tenements were replaced by single  and multifamily housing  22  By 2000  the Bronx had a population of about 1 2 million  and its bridges  highways  and railroads were more heavily traveled than those of any other part of the United States   edit  Fighting decline Row houses now stand where there was once burnt rubble  The Bronx has seen an increase in revitalization in recent years  Starting in the mid 1960s to the mid 1970s  the Bronx went into an era of sharp decline in the residents  quality of life  Historians and social scientists have put forward many factors  They include the theory  elaborated in Robert Caro s biography The Power Broker  23  that Robert Moses  Cross Bronx Expressway destroyed existing residential neighborhoods  Another factor in the Bronx s decline may have been the development of high rise housing projects  Yet another may have been a reduction in the real estate listings and property related financial services  such as mortgages or insurance policies  offered in some areas of the Bronx   a process known as redlining  Others have suggested a  planned shrinkage  of municipal services  such as fire fighting  24  25  There was also much debate as to whether rent control laws had made it less profitable  or more costly  for landlords to maintain existing buildings with their existing tenants than to abandon or destroy those buildings  26  In the 1970s  the Bronx was plagued by a wave of arson  The burning of buildings was mostly in the South Bronx and in West Farms  The most common explanation of what occurred was that landlords decided to burn their low property value buildings and take the insurance money as profit  27  After the fiery destruction of many buildings in the borough  the arsons slowed by the turn of the decade  but the after effects were still felt into the 1990s  Since the mid 1980s  some residential development has occurred in the Bronx  stimulated by the city s  Ten Year Housing Plan  28  29  and community members working to rebuild the social  economic and environmental infrastructure by creating affordable housing  Groups affiliated with churches in the South Bronx erected the Nehemiah Homes with about 1 000 units  The grass roots organization Nos Quedamos  endeavor known as Melrose Commons 30  31  32  began to rebuild areas in the South Bronx  The ripple effects have been felt borough wide  The IRT White Plains Road Line began to show an increase in riders  Chains such as Marshalls  Staples  and Target have opened stores in the Bronx  More bank branches have opened in the Bronx as a whole  rising from 106 in 1997 to 149 in 2007   although not primarily in poor or minority neighborhoods  while the Bronx still has fewer branches per person than other boroughs  33  34  35  36  Although not actually a city  in 1997  the Bronx was designated an All America City by the National Civic League  signifying its comeback from the decline of the 1970s  In 2006  The New York Times reported that  construction cranes have become the borough s new visual metaphor  replacing the window decals of the 1980s in which pictures of potted plants and drawn curtains were placed in the windows of abandoned buildings   37  The borough has experienced substantial new building construction since 2002  Between 2002 and June 2007  33 687 new units of housing were built or were under way and  4 8 billion has been invested in new housing  In the first six months of 2007 alone total investment in new residential development was  965 million and 5 187 residential units were scheduled to be completed  Much of the new development is springing up in formerly vacant lots across the South Bronx  38

Bronx River near Yonkers  It opened in 1863  at a time when the Bronx was still considered a rural area  The northern side of the borough includes the largest park in New York City   Pelham Bay Park  which includes Orchard Beach   and the fourth largest  Van Cortlandt Park  which is west of Woodlawn Cemetery and borders Yonkers  Nearer the borough s center  and along the Bronx River  is Bronx Park  Its northern end houses the New York Botanical Gardens  which preserve the last patch of the original hemlock forest that once covered the entire city  and its southern end the Bronx Zoo  the largest urban zoological gardens in the U S  46  Farther south is Crotona Park  home to a 3 3 acre  1 3 ha  lake  28 species of trees and a large swimming pool  47  The land for these parks  and many others  was bought by New York City in 1888  while land was still open and inexpensive  in anticipation of future needs and future pressures for development  48  Some of the acquired land was set aside for the Grand Concourse and Pelham Parkway  the first of a series of boulevards and parkways  thoroughfares lined with trees  vegetation and greenery   Later projects included the Bronx River Parkway  which developed a road while restoring the riverbank and reducing pollution  Mosholu Parkway and the Henry Hudson Parkway  The Northern tip of Hunter Island in Pelham Bay Park  Just south of Van Cortlandt Park is the Jerome Park Reservoir  surrounded by 2 miles  3 km  of stone walls and bordering several small parks in the Bedford Park neighborhood  The reservoir was built in the 1890s on the site of the former Jerome Park Racetrack  49  In 2006  a five year   220 million program of capital improvements and natural restoration in 70 Bronx parks was begun  financed by water and sewer revenues  as part of an agreement that allowed a water filtration plant under Van Cortlandt Park s golf course  One major focus is on opening more of the Bronx River s banks and restoring them to a

streets The Bronx street grid is irregular  Like the northernmost part of upper Manhattan  the West Bronx s hilly terrain leaves a relatively free style street grid  Much of the West Bronx s street numbering carries over from upper Manhattan  but does not match it exactly  East 132nd Street is the lowest numbered street in the Bronx  This dates from the mid 19th century when the southwestern area of Westchester County west of the Bronx River  was incorporated into New York City and known as the Northside  The East Bronx is considerably flatter  and the street layout tends to be more regular  Only the Wakefield neighborhood picks up the street numbering  albeit at a disalignment due to Tremont Avenue s layout  At the same diagonal latitude  West 262nd Street in Riverdale matches East 237th Street in Wakefield  Three major north south thoroughfares run between Manhattan and the Bronx  Third Avenue  Park Avenue  and Broadway  Other major north south roads include the Grand Concourse  Jerome Avenue  Sedgwick Avenue  Webster Avenue  and White Plains Road  Major east west thoroughfares include Mosholu Parkway  Gun Hill Road  Fordham Road  Pelham Parkway  and Tremont Avenue

Herc was a D J  and M C  at a party in the recreation room of 1520 Sedgewick Avenue in the Bronx adjacent to the Cross Bronx Expressway  89  While it was not the actual  Birthplace of Hip Hop    the genre developed slowly in several places in the 1970s   it was verified to be the place where one of the pivotal and formative events occurred  89  Specifically  DJ Kool Herc  extended an instrumental beat  mixing or scratching  to let people dance longer  B boying  and began MC ing  rapping  during the extended breakdancing       This  helped lay the foundation for a cultural revolution   History

beats  and became known as MCs or emcees  The Herculoids  made up of Herc  Coke La Rock  and DJ Clark Kent  were the earliest to gain major fame  The Bronx is referred to in hip hop slang as  The
