and Manga Portal v t e Anime         anime    listen   i   n me   or     n me    is the Japanese abbreviated pronunciation of  animation   In English speaking countries  anime refers to a style of animation originating in Japan  characterized by colorful graphics and often featuring themes intended for an adult audience  1  The intended meaning of the word  anime  sometimes varies  depending on the context  2  While the earliest known Japanese animation dates to 1917  and many original Japanese cartoons were produced in the ensuing decades  the characteristic anime style developed in the 1960s notably with the work of Osamu Tezuka and became known outside Japan in the 1980s  Anime  like manga  has a large audience in Japan and recognition throughout the world  Distributors can release anime via television broadcasts  directly to video  or theatrically  as well as online  Both hand drawn and computer animated anime exist  It is used in television series  films  video  video games  commercials  and internet based releases  and represents most  if not all  genres of fiction  As the market for anime increased in Japan  it also gained popularity in East and Southeast Asia  Anime is currently popular in many different regions around the world  citation needed  Contents 1 History 2 Terminology 2 1 Word usage 2 2 Synonyms 3 Visual characteristics 3 1 Character design 3 1 1

External links History Main article  History of anime A cel from the earliest known Japanese animated short from 1917  Screenshot from Momotaro s Divine Sea Warriors  1944   the first feature length anime film Anime began at the start of the 20th century  when Japanese filmmakers experimented with the animation techniques also pioneered in France  Germany  the United States  and Russia  3  The oldest known anime in existence first screened in 1917   a two minute clip of a samurai trying to test a new sword on his target  only to suffer defeat  4  5  Early pioneers included Shimokawa Oten  Jun ichi Kouchi  and Seitar  Kitayama  6  By the 1930s animation became an alternative format of storytelling to the live action industry in Japan  But it suffered competition from foreign producers and many animators  such as Nobur   fuji and Yasuji Murata still worked in cheaper cutout not cel animation  although with masterful results  7  Other creators  such as Kenz  Masaoka and Mitsuyo Seo  nonetheless made great strides in animation technique  especially with increasing help from a government using animation in education and propaganda  8  The first talkie anime was Chikara to Onna no Yo no Naka  produced by Masaoka in 1933  9  10  The first feature length animated film was Momotaro s Divine Sea Warriors directed by Seo in 1945 with sponsorship by the Imperial Japanese Navy  11  The success of The Walt Disney Company s 1937 feature film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs influenced Japanese animators  12  In the 1960s  manga artist and animator Osamu Tezuka adapted and simplified many Disney animation techniques to reduce costs and to limit the number of frames in productions  He intended this as a temporary measure to allow him to produce material on a tight schedule with inexperienced animation staff  The 1970s saw a surge of growth in the popularity of manga   many of them later animated  The work of Osamu Tezuka drew particular attention  he has been called a  legend  13  and the  god of manga   14  15  His work   and that of other pioneers in the field   inspired characteristics and genres that remain fundamental elements of anime today  The giant robot genre  known as  Mecha  outside Japan   for instance  took shape under Tezuka  developed into the Super Robot genre under Go Nagai and others  and was revolutionized at the end of the decade by Yoshiyuki Tomino who developed the Real Robot genre  Robot anime like the Gundam and The Super Dimension Fortress Macross series became instant classics in the 1980s  and the robot genre of anime is still one of the most common in Japan and worldwide today  In the 1980s  anime became more accepted in the mainstream in Japan  although less than manga   and experienced a boom in production  Following a few successful adaptations of anime in overseas markets in the 1980s  anime gained increased acceptance in those markets in the 1990s and even more at the turn of the 21st century  Terminology Japanese write the English term  animation  in katakana as          anim shon  pronounced  anime  o     and the term      anime  pronounced  anime    listen  in Japanese  emerged in the 1970s as an abbreviation  16  Others claim that the word derives from the French phrase dessin anim   3  Japanese speakers use both the original and abbreviated forms interchangeably  but the shorter form occurs more commonly  The pronunciation of anime in Japanese   anime   differs significantly from the Standard English    n me    which has different vowels and stress   In Japanese each mora carries equal stress   As with a few other Japanese words such as sak   Pok mon  and Kobo Ab   English language texts sometimes spell anime as anim   as in French   with an acute accent over the final e  to cue the reader to pronounce the letter  not to leave it silent as English orthography might suggest  Word usage In Japan  the term anime does not specify an animation s nation of origin or style  instead  it serves as a blanket term to refer to all forms of animation from around the world  17  18  English language dictionaries define anime as  a Japanese style of motion picture animation  or as  a style of animation developed in Japan   19  20  Non Japanese works that borrow stylization from anime are commonly referred to as  anime influenced animation  but it is not unusual for a viewer who does not know the country of origin of such material to refer to it as simply  anime   Some works result from co productions with non Japanese companies  such as most of the traditionally animated Rankin Bass works  the Cartoon Network and Production I G series IGPX or  ban Star Racers  different viewers may or may not consider these anime  In English  anime  when used as a common noun  normally functions as a mass noun  for example   Do you watch anime     How much anime have you collected     21  However  in casual usage the word also appears as a count noun  Anime can also be used as a suppletive adjective or classifier noun   The anime Guyver is different from the movie Guyver    Synonyms English speakers occasionally refer to anime as  Japanimation   but this term has fallen into disuse   Japanimation  saw the most usage during the 1970s and 1980s  but the term  anime  supplanted it in the mid 1990s as the material became more widely known in English speaking countries  22  In general  the term now only appears in nostalgic contexts  22  Since  anime  does not identify the country of origin in Japanese usage   Japanimation  is used to distinguish Japanese work from that of the rest of the world  22  In Japan   manga  can refer to both animation and comics  Among English speakers   manga  has the stricter meaning of  Japanese comics   in parallel to the usage of  anime  in and outside of Japan  The term  ani manga  is used to describe comics produced from animation cels  23  Visual characteristics Anime artists use many distinct visual styles  Many commentators refer to anime as an art form  24  As a visual medium  it can emphasize visual styles  The styles can vary from artist to artist or from studio to studio  Some titles make extensive use of common stylization  FLCL  for example  has a reputation for wild  exaggerated stylization  Other titles use different methods  Only Yesterday or Jin Roh take much more realistic approaches  featuring few stylistic exaggerations  Pok mon uses drawings which specifically do not distinguish the nationality of characters  25  While different titles and different artists have their own artistic styles  many stylistic elements have become so common that describe them as definitive of anime in general  However  this does not mean that all modern anime share one strict  common art style  Many anime have a very different art style from what would commonly be called  anime style   yet fans still use the word  anime  to refer to these titles  Generally  the most common form of anime drawings include  exaggerated physical features such as large eyes  big hair and elongated limbs    and dramatically shaped speech bubbles  speed lines and onomatopoeic  exclamatory typography   26  The influences of Japanese calligraphy and Japanese painting also characterize linear qualities of the anime style  The round ink brush traditionally used for writing kanji and for painting  produces a stroke of widely varying thickness  Anime also tends to borrow many elements from manga  including text in the background and panel layouts  For example  an opening may employ manga panels to tell the story  or to dramatize a point for humorous effect  See for example the anime Kare Kano  Character design Basic character designs use techniques implemented in cartoon design  citation needed  Among these techniques include the use of reference sketches to ensure character proportionality and multiple angle designs  Proportions Body proportions emulated in anime come from proportions of the human body  The height of the head is considered by the artist as the base unit of proportion  Head heights can vary as long as the remainder of the body remains proportional  Most anime characters are about seven to eight heads tall  and extreme heights are set around nine heads tall  27  Variations to proportion can be modified by the artist  Super deformed characters feature a non proportionally small body compared to the head  Sometimes specific body parts  like legs  are shortened or elongated for added emphasis  Most super deformed characters are two to four heads tall  Some anime works like Crayon Shin chan completely disregard these proportions  such that they resemble Western cartoons  For exaggeration  certain body features are increased in proportion  27  Comedic effects often utilize these variations  Eye styles Many anime and manga characters feature large eyes  Osamu Tezuka  who is believed to have been the first to use this technique  was inspired by the exaggerated features of American cartoon characters such as Betty Boop  Mickey Mouse  and Disney s Bambi  3  28  Tezuka found that large eyes style allowed his characters to show emotions distinctly  When Tezuka began drawing Ribbon no Kishi  the first manga specifically targeted at young girls  Tezuka further exaggerated the size of the characters  eyes  Indeed  through Ribbon no Kishi  Tezuka set a stylistic template that later sh jo artists tended to follow  Coloring is added to give eyes  particularly to the cornea  some depth  The depth is accomplished by applying variable color shading  Generally  a mixture of a light shade  the tone color  and a dark shade is used  29  30  Cultural anthropologist Matt Thorn argues that Japanese animators and audiences do not perceive such stylized eyes as inherently more or less foreign  31  However  not all anime have large eyes  For example  some of the work of Hayao Miyazaki and Toshiro Kawamoto are known for having realistically proportioned eyes  as well as realistic hair colors on their characters  32  Facial expressions See also  Manga iconography Anime characters may employ a variety of predetermined facial expressions to denote moods and thoughts  33  These techniques are often different in form than their counterparts in western animation  and they include a fixed iconography that s used as shorthand for certain emotions and moods  34  There are a number of other stylistic elements that are common to conventional anime as well but more often used in comedies  Characters that are shocked or surprised will perform a  face fault   in which they display an extremely exaggerated expression  Angry characters may exhibit a  vein  or  stress mark  effect  where lines representing bulging veins will appear on their forehead  Angry women will sometimes summon a mallet from nowhere and strike another character with it  mainly for the sake of slapstick comedy  Male characters will develop a bloody nose around their female love interests  typically to indicate arousal  which is a play on an old wives  tale   34  Embarrassed or stressed characters either produce a massive sweat drop  which has become one of the most widely recognized motifs of conventional anime  or produce a visibly red blush or set of parallel  sometimes squiggly  lines beneath the eyes  especially as a manifestation of repressed romantic feelings  Characters who want to childishly taunt someone may pull an akanbe face  by pulling an eyelid down with a finger to expose the red underside   Characters may also have large  X  eyes to show a knockout  or in some cases  even illness  This is typically used for comedic purposes  Vacant  non reflecting eyes can be used to indicate a state of semi consciousness  Animation technique Main article  Animation Like all animation  the production processes of storyboarding  voice acting  character design  cel production and so on still apply  With improvements in computer technology  computer animation increased the efficiency of the whole production process  Anime is often considered a form of limited animation  That means that stylistically  even in bigger productions the conventions of limited animation are used to fool the eye into thinking there is more movement than there is  3  Many of the techniques that are used comprise cost cutting measures while working under a set budget  Anime scenes place emphasis on achieving three dimensional views  Backgrounds depict the scenes  atmosphere  3  For example  anime often puts emphasis on changing seasons  as can be seen in numerous anime  such as Tenchi Muyo   Sometimes actual settings have been duplicated into an anime  The backgrounds for the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya are based on various locations within the suburb of Nishinomiya  Hyogo  Japan  35  The large majority of anime uses traditional animation  which better allows for division of labor  pose to pose approach and checking of drawings before they are shot   practices favored by the anime industry  36  Other mediums are mostly limited to independently made short films  37  examples of which are the silhouette and other cutout animation of Nobur   fuji  36  38  the stop motion puppet animation of Tadahito Mochinaga  Kihachir  Kawamoto 39  and Tomoyasu Murata 40  and the computer animation of Satoshi Tomioka 41   most famously Usavich   42  Camera effects Camera angles  camera movement  and lighting play an important role in scenes  Directors often have the discretion of determining viewing angles for scenes  particularly regarding backgrounds  In addition  camera angles show perspective  43  Directors can also choose camera effects within cinematography  such as panning  zooming  facial closeup  and panoramic  44  Story themes A wide variety of stories have been adapted into anime  They are sourced from Japanese history  classical literature  and even adult oriented themes  While animation for children exists  most anime are intended for an older audience  45  Distribution See also  Anime licensing While anime had entered markets beyond Japan in the 1960s  it grew as a major cultural export during its market expansion during the 1980s and 1990s  The anime market for the United States alone is  worth approximately  4 35 billion  according to the Japan External Trade Organization   46  Anime has also had commercial success in Asia  Europe and Latin America  where anime has become more mainstream than in the United States  For example  the Saint Seiya video game was released in Europe due to the popularity of the show even years after the series has been off air  Anime distribution companies handled the licensing and distribution of anime outside Japan  Licensed anime is modified by distributors through dubbing into the language of the country and adding language subtitles to the Japanese language track  Using a similar global distribution pattern as Hollywood  the world is divided into five regions  Some editing of cultural references may occur to better follow the references of the non Japanese culture  47  Certain companies may remove any objectionable content  complying with domestic law  This editing process was far more prevalent in the past  e g  Voltron   but its use has declined because of the demand for anime in its original form  This  light touch  approach to localization has favored viewers formerly unfamiliar with anime  Robotech and Star Blazers were the earliest attempts to present anime  albeit still modified  to North American television audiences without harsh censoring for violence and mature themes  With the advent of DVD  it became possible to include multiple language tracks into a simple product  This was not the case with VHS cassette  in which separate VHS media were used and with each VHS cassette priced the same as a single DVD  The  light touch  approach also applies to DVD releases as they often include both the dubbed audio and the original Japanese audio with subtitles  typically unedited  Anime edited for television is usually released on DVD  uncut   with all scenes intact  The Internet has played a significant role in the exposure of anime beyond Japan  Prior to the 1990s  anime had limited exposure beyond Japan s borders  Coincidentally  as the popularity of the Internet grew  so did interest in anime  Much of the fandom of anime grew through the Internet  The combination of internet communities and increasing amounts of anime material  from video to images  helped spur the growth of fandom  48  As the Internet gained more widespread use  Internet advertising revenues grew from 1 6 billion yen to over 180 billion yen between 1995 and 2005  49  Some fan groups add subtitles to anime on their own and distribute the episodes  These are known as fansubs  Before the popularity of the Internet  fansubbing used VHS as a means of distribution  citation needed  Often  people will collect these fansubs and upload them to websites which they also put advertisements on so as to earn money  which violates copyright laws in many countries  citation needed  The ethical implications of distributing or watching fansubs are topics of much controversy even when fansub groups do not profit from their activities  Once the series has been licensed outside of Japan  fansub groups often cease distribution of their work  In one case  Media Factory Incorporated requested that no fansubs of their material be made  which was respected by the fansub community  50  In another instance  Bandai specifically thanked fansubbers for their role in helping to make The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya popular in the English speaking world  51  Broadcasting See also  Television in Japan  Late night anime  and UHF anime TV networks regularly broadcast anime programming  In Japan  major national TV networks  such as TV Tokyo broadcast anime regularly  Smaller regional stations broadcast anime under the UHF  In the United States  cable TV channels such as Cartoon Network  Disney  Syfy  and others dedicate some of their timeslots to anime  Some  such as the Anime Network and the FUNimation Channel  specifically show anime  Sony based Animax and Disney s Jetix channel broadcast anime within many countries in the world  AnimeCentral solely broadcasts anime in the UK  Influence on world culture Anime has become commercially profitable in western countries  as early commercially successful western adaptations of anime  such as Astro Boy  have revealed  52  The phenomenal success of Nintendo s multi billion dollar Pok mon franchise 53  was helped greatly by the spin off anime series that  first broadcast in the late 1990s  is still running worldwide to this day  In doing so  anime has made significant impacts upon Western culture  Since the 19th century  many Westerners have expressed a particular interest towards Japan  Anime dramatically exposed more Westerners to the culture of Japan  Aside from anime  other facets of Japanese culture increased in popularity  54  Worldwide  the number of people studying Japanese increased  In 1984  the Japanese Language Proficiency Test was devised to meet increasing demand  55  Even domestic animation industries had made attempts at emulating anime  Anime influenced animation refers to non Japanese works of animation that emulate the visual style of anime  56  Most of these works are created by studios in the United States  Europe  and non Japanese Asia  and they generally incorporate stylizations  methods  and gags described in anime physics  as in the case of Avatar  The Last Airbender  Often  production crews either are fans of anime or are required to view anime  57  Some creators cite anime as a source of inspiration with their own series  58  59  Furthermore  a French production team for  ban Star Racers moved to Tokyo to collaborate with a Japanese production team from Hal Film Maker  60  Critics and the general anime fanbase do not consider them as anime  61  Some American animated television series have singled out anime styling with satirical intent  for example South Park  with  Chinpokomon  and with  Good Times with Weapons    South Park has a notable drawing style  itself parodied in  Brittle Bullet   the fifth episode of the anime FLCL  released several months after  Chinpokomon  aired  This intent on satirizing anime is the springboard for the basic premise of Kappa Mikey  a Nicktoons Network original cartoon  Even clich s normally found in anime are parodied in some series  such as Perfect Hair Forever  Anime conventions began to appear in the early 1990s  during the Anime boom  starting with Anime Expo  Animethon  Otakon  and JACON  Currently anime conventions are held annually in various cities across the Americas  Asia  and Europe  62  Many attendees participate in cosplay  where they dress up as anime characters  Also  guests from Japan ranging from artists  directors  and music groups are invited  In addition to anime conventions  anime clubs have become prevalent in colleges  high schools  and community centers as a way to publicly exhibit anime as well as broadening Japanese cultural understanding  63  Viewers may also pick up on Japanese terms either within or related to anime  though at times those words may take on different connotations  For instance  the Japanese term otaku is used as a term for anime fans beyond Japan  more particularly the obsessive ones  The negative connotations associated with the word in Japan have lessened in foreign context  where it instead connotes the pride of the fans  See also Japan portal Animation portal Anime and manga portal Book  Anime and Manga Wikipedia books are collections
