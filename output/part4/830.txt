Magic realism From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search Magic realism or magical realism is an aesthetic style or genre of fiction  1  in which magical elements blend with the real world  The story explains these magical elements as real occurrences  presented in a straightforward manner that places the  real  and the  fantastic  in the same stream of thought  It is a film  literary and visual art genre  One example of magic realism is when a character in the story continues to be alive beyond the normal length of life and this is subtly depicted by the character being present throughout many generations  On the surface the story has no clear magical attributes and everything is conveyed in a real setting  but such a character breaks the rules of our real world  The author may give precise details of the real world such as the date of birth of a reference character and the army recruitment age  but such facts help to define an age for the fantastic character of the story that would turn out to be an abnormal occurrence like someone living for two hundred years  The term is broadly descriptive rather than critically rigorous  Winona State University Asst  Professor of Japanese Studies  and author  Matthew Strecher defines magic realism as     what happens when a highly detailed  realistic setting is invaded by something too strange to believe   2  This critical perspective towards magical realism stems from the Western reader s disassociation with mythology  a root of magical realism more easily understood by non Western cultures  3  Western confusion regarding magical realism is due to the     conception of the real  created in a magical realist text  rather than explain reality using natural or physical laws  as in typical Western texts  magical realist texts create a reality     in which the relation between incidents  characters  and setting could not be based upon or justified by their status within the physical world or their normal acceptance by bourgeois mentality   4  Many writers are categorized as  magical realist   which confuses what the term really means and how wide its definition is  5  Contents 1 Etymology 2

appeared in 1955  the German art critic Franz Roh first used the phrase in 1925  to refer to a painterly style also known as Neue Sachlichkeit  the New Objectivity   6  an alternative championed by fellow German museum director Gustav Hartlaub  7  Roh believed magic realism is related to  but distinctive from  surrealism  due to magic realism s focus on the material object and the actual existence of things in the world  as opposed to the more cerebral  psychological and subconscious reality that the surrealists explored  8  Magic realism was later used to describe the uncanny realism by American painters such as Ivan Albright  Paul Cadmus  George Tooker and other artists during the 1940s and 1950s  However  in contrast with its use in literature  magical realist art does not often include overtly fantastic or magical content  but rather looks at the mundane  the every day  through a hyper realistic and often mysterious lens  9  The extent to which magical elements enter in visual art depends on the subcategory  discussed in detail below  Roh s magic realism s theoretical implications greatly influenced European and Latin American literature  Italian Massimo Bontempelli  for instance  considered the first magic realist creative writer  sought to present the     mysterious and fantastic quality of reality   He claimed that literature could be a means to create a collective consciousness by     opening new mythical and magical perspectives on reality   and used his writings to inspire an Italian nation governed by Fascism  8  Venezuelan Arturo Uslar Pietri was closely associated with Roh s form of magic realism and knew Bontempelli in Paris  Rather than follow Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier s developing versions of  the  Latin  American marvelous real   Uslar Pietri s writings emphasize     the mystery of human living amongst the reality of life   He believed magic realism was     a continuation of the vanguardia  or Avant garde  modernist experimental writings of Latin America   8  Literary magic realism originated in Latin America  Writers often traveled between their home country and European cultural hubs  such as Paris or Berlin  and were influenced by the art movement of the time  3  10  Carpentier and Uslar Pietri  for example  were strongly influenced by European artistic movements  such as Surrealism  during their stays in Paris in the 1920s and 1930s  8  One major event that linked painterly and literary magic realisms was the translation and publication of Roh s book into Spanish by Spain s Revista de Occidente in 1927  headed by major literary figure Jos  Ortega y Gasset   Within a year  Magic Realism was being applied to the prose of European authors in the literary circles of Buenos Aires   11 Jorge Luis Borges inspired and encouraged other Latin American writers in the development of magical realism   particularly with his first magical realist publication  Historia universal de la infamia in 1935  12  Between 1940 and 1950  magical realism in Latin America reached its peak  with prominent writers appearing mainly in Argentina  13   edit  Literature  edit  Characteristics The extent to which the characteristics below apply to a given magic realist text varies  Every text is different and employs a smattering of the qualities listed here  However  they accurately portray what one might expect from a magic realist text   edit  Fantastical elements As recently as 2008  magical realism in literature has been defined as     a kind of modern fiction in which fabulous and fantastical events are included in a narrative that otherwise maintains the  reliable  tone of objective realistic report  designating a tendency of the modern novel to reach beyond the confines of realism and draw upon the energies of fable  folk tale  and myth while maintaining a strong contemporary social relevance  The fantastic attributes given to characters in such novels levitation  flight  telepathy  telekinesis are among the means that magic realism adopts in order to encompass the often phantasmagorical political realities of the 20th century   14   edit  Plenitude In an essay entitled  The Baroque and the Marvelous Real  the Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier championed the idea that the baroque is defined by a lack of emptiness  a departure from structure or rules  and an  extraordinary  plenitude of disorienting detail  citing Mondrian as its polar opposite   From this angle  Carpentier views the baroque as a layering of elements  which translates easily into the post colonial or transcultural Latin American atmosphere that Carpentier emphasizes in The Kingdom of this World  15   America  a continent of symbiosis  mutations   mestizaje  engenders the baroque   16  made explicit by elaborate Aztec temples and associative Nahuatl poetry  These mixing ethnicities grow together with the American baroque  the space in between is where the  marvelous real  is seen  Marvelous  not meaning beautiful and pleasant  but extraordinary  strange  excellent  Such a complex system of layering encompassed in the Latin American  boom  novel  such as One Hundred Years of Solitude has as its aim     translating the scope of America   17   edit  Hybridity Magical realism plot lines characteristically employ hybrid multiple planes of reality that take place in     inharmonious arenas of such opposites as urban and rural  and Western and indigenous   18  19  For example  as seen in Julio Cort zar s  La noche boca arriba   an individual experiences two realistic situations simultaneously in the same place but during two different time periods  centuries apart  20  His dreamlike state connects these two realities  this small bit of magic makes these multiple planes of reality possible  21  Overall  they establish     a more deep and true reality than conventional realist techniques would illustrate   18  22   edit  Metafiction This trait centers on the reader s role in literature  With its multiple realities and specific reference to the reader s world  it explores the impact fiction has on reality  reality on fiction and the reader s role in between  as such  it is well suited for drawing attention to social or political criticism  Furthermore  it is the tool paramount in the execution of a related and major magic realist phenomenon  textualization  This term defines two conditions first  where a fictitious reader enters the story within a story while reading it  making us self conscious of our status as readers and secondly  where the textual world enters into the reader s  our  world  Good sense would negate this process but  magic  is the flexible topos that allows it  23   edit  Authorial reticence Authorial reticence is the     deliberate withholding of information and explanations about the disconcerting fictitious world   24  The narrator does not provide explanations about the accuracy or credibility of events described or views expressed by characters in the text  Further  the narrator is indifferent  a characteristic enhanced by this absence of explanation of fantastic events  the story proceeds with  logical precision  as if nothing extraordinary took place  25  26  In this  explaining the supernatural world would immediately reduce its legitimacy relative to the natural world  The reader would consequently disregard the supernatural as false testimony   edit  Sense of mystery Something that most critics agree on is this major theme  Magic realist literature tends to read at an intensified level  Taking the seminal work of the style  One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garc a M rquez  the reader must let go of preexisting ties to conventional exposition  plot advancement  linear time structure  scientific reason  etc   to strive for a state of heightened awareness of life s connectedness or hidden meanings  Carpentier articulates this feeling as     to seize the mystery that breathes behind things   27  and supports the claim by saying a writer must heighten his senses to the point of  estado limite   translated as  limit state  or  extreme   28   in order to realize all levels of reality  most importantly that of mystery  29   edit  Collective consciousness The Mexican critic Luis Leal has said   Without thinking of the concept of magical realism  each writer gives expression to a reality he observes in the people  To me  magical realism is an attitude on the part of the characters in the novel toward the world   or toward nature  He adds   If you can explain it  then it s not magical realism   30   edit  Political critique Magic realism contains an     implicit criticism of society  particularly the elite   31  Especially with regard to Latin America  the style breaks from the inarguable discourse of     privileged centers of literature   32  This is a mode primarily about and for  ex centrics   the geographically  socially and economically marginalized  Therefore  magic realism s  alternative world  works to correct the reality of established viewpoints  like realism  naturalism  modernism   Magic realist texts  under this logic  are subversive texts  revolutionary against socially dominant forces  Alternatively  the socially dominant may implement magical realism to disassociate themselves from their  power discourse   33  Theo D haen titles this change in perspective   decentering   Upon consideration  Latin America is the ideal locale and starting place for such literary subversions to a dominant power  from the colonizers to the dictators   edit  Major topics in criticism  edit  Ambiguities in definition Determining who coined the term magical realism  as opposed to magic realism  is controversial among literary critics  Maggie Ann Bowers argues that it first emerged in the 1955 essay  Magical Realism in Spanish American Fiction  by critic Angel Flores  She notes that while Flores names Jorge Luis Borges as the first magical realist  some critics consider him a predecessor  not actually a magical realist   he fails to acknowledge either Alejo Carpentier or Arturo Uslar Pietri for bringing Roh s magic realism to Latin America  8  However  both Luis Leal and Irene Guenther   referencing Pietri and Jean Weisgerber texts  respectively   attest that Pietri was one of the first  if not the first  to apply the term to Latin American literature  34  35  Leal and Guenther both quote Pietri  who described     man as a mystery surrounded by realistic facts  A poetic prediction or a poetic denial of reality  What for lack of another name could be called a magical realism    36  It is worth noting that Pietri  in presenting his term for this literary tendency  always kept its definition open by means of a language more lyrical and evocative than strictly critical  as in this 1948 statement  When academic critics attempted to define magical realism with scholarly exactitude  they discovered that it was more powerful than precise  Critics  frustrated by their inability to pin down the term s meaning  have urged its complete abandonment  Yet in Arturo Uslar Pietri s vague  ample usage  magical realism was wildly successful in summarizing for many readers their perception of much Latin American fiction  this fact suggests that the term has its uses  so long as it is not expected to function with the precision expected of technical  scholarly terminology   Guatemalan author William Spindler s article   Magic realism  a typology   37  suggests that there are three kinds of magic realism  which however are by no means incompatible  European  metaphysical  magic realism  with its sense of estrangement and the uncanny  exemplified by Kafka s fiction   ontological  magical realism  characterized by  matter of factness  in relating  inexplicable  events  and  anthropological  magical realism  where a Native worldview is set side by side with the Western rational worldview  38  Spindler s typology of magic realism has been criticized as     an act of categorization which seeks to define Magic Realism as a culturally specific project  by identifying for his readers those  non modern  societies where myth and magic persist and where Magic Realism might be expected to occur  There are objections to this analysis  Western rationalism models may not actually describe Western modes of thinking and it is possible to conceive of instances where both orders of knowledge are simultaneously possible   39   edit  Lo real maravilloso Alejo Carpentier originated the term lo real maravilloso  roughly the  marvelous reality   in the prologue to his novel The Kingdom of this World  1949   however  some debate whether he is truly a magical realist writer  or simply a precursor and source of inspiration  Maggie Bowers claims he is widely acknowledged as the originator of Latin American magical realism  as both a novelist and critic   8  she describes Carpentier s conception as a kind of heightened reality where elements of the miraculous can appear while seeming natural and unforced  She suggests that by disassociating himself and his writings from Roh s painterly magic realism  Carpentier aimed to show how by virtue of Latin America s varied history  geography  demography  politics  myths  and beliefs improbable and marvelous things are made possible  8  Furthermore  Carpentier s meaning is that Latin America is a land filled with marvels  and that  writing about this land automatically produces a literature of marvelous reality   40  Alejo Carpentier  The marvelous  may be easily confused with magical realism  as both modes introduce supernatural events without surprising the implied author  In both  these magical events are expected and accepted as everyday occurrences  However  the marvelous world is a unidimensional world  The implied author believes that anything can happen here  as the entire world is filled with supernatural beings and situations to begin with  Fairy tales are a good example of marvelous literature  The important idea in defining the marvelous is that readers understand that this fictional world is different from the world where they live  The  marvelous  one dimensional world differs from the bidimensional world of magical realism  as in the latter  the supernatural realm blends with the natural  familiar world  arriving at the combination of two layers of reality  bidimensional   41  While some use the terms magical realism and lo real maravilloso interchangeably  the key difference lies in the focus  42  Critic Luis Leal attests that Carpentier was an originating pillar of the magical realist style by implicitly referring to the latter s critical works  writing that  The existence of the marvelous real is what started magical realist literature  which some critics claim is the truly American literature   43  It can consequently be drawn that Carpentier s  lo real maravilloso  is especially distinct from magical realism by the fact that the former applies specifically to America  44  On that note  Lee A  Daniel categorizes critics of Carpentier into three groups  those that don t consider him a magical realist whatsoever   ngel Flores   those that call him  a m gicorealista writer with no mention of his  lo real maravilloso   G mez Gil  Jean Franco  Carlos Fuentes    and those that use the two terms interchangeably  Fernando Alegria  Luis Leal  Emir Rodriguez Monegal   45   edit  Latin American exclusivity Criticism that Latin America is the birthplace and cornerstone of all things magic realist is quite common   ngel Flores does not deny that magical realism is an international commodity but articulates that it has a Hispanic birthplace  writing that   Magical realism is a continuation of the romantic realist tradition of Spanish language literature and its European counterparts   46  Flores is not alone on this front  there is argument between those who see magical realism as a Latin American invention and those who see it as the global product of a postmodern world  47  Irene Guenther concludes   Conjecture aside  it is in Latin America that  magical realism  was primarily seized by literary criticism and was  through translation and literary appropriation  transformed   35  Magic realism has taken on an internationalization  dozens of non Hispanic writers are categorized as such  and many believe that it truly is an international commodity  48   edit  Postmodernism Taking into account that  theoretically  magical realism was born in the 20th century  connecting it to postmodernism is a logical next step  To further connect the two concepts  there are descriptive commonalities between the two that Belgian critic Theo D haen addresses in his essay   Magical Realism and Postmodernism   Authors G nter Grass  Thomas Bernhard  Peter Handke  Italo Calvino  John Fowles  Angela Carter  John Banville  Michel Tournier  Giannina Braschi  Willem Brakman and Louis Ferron are widely considered postmodernist  but might  just as easily be categorized   magic realist   49  A list has been compiled of characteristics one might typically attribute to postmodernism  but which also could describe literary magic realism      self reflexiveness  metafiction  eclecticism  redundancy  multiplicity  discontinuity  intertextuality  parody  the dissolution of character and narrative instance  the erasure of boundaries  and the destabilization of the reader   50  To further connect the two  magical realism and postmodernism share the themes of post colonial discourse  in which jumps in time and focus cannot really be explained with scientific but rather with magical reasoning  textualization  of the reader   and metafiction  more detail  under Themes and Qualities   Concerning attitude toward audience  the two have a lot in common  Magical realist works do not seek to primarily satisfy a popular audience  but instead  a sophisticated audience that must be attuned to noticing textual  subtleties   51  While the postmodern writer condemns escapist literature  like fantasy  crime  ghost fiction   he she is inextricably related to it concerning readership  There are two modes in postmodern literature  one  commercially successful pop fiction  and the other  philosophy  better suited to intellectuals  A singular reading of the first mode will render a distorted or reductive understanding of the text  The fictitious reader such as Aureliano from 100 Years of Solitude is the hostage used to express the writer s anxiety on this issue of who is reading the work and to what ends  and of how the writer is forever reliant upon the needs and desires of readers  the market   52  The magic realist writer with difficulty must reach a balance between saleability and intellectual integrity  Wendy Faris  talking about magic realism as a contemporary phenomenon that leaves modernism for postmodernism  says   Magic realist fictions do seem more youthful and popular than their modernist predecessors  in that they often  though not always  cater with unidirectional story lines to our basic desire to hear what happens next  Thus they may be more clearly designed for the entertainment of readers   53   edit  Comparison with related genres When attempting to define what something is  it is often helpful to define what something is not  It is also important to note that many literary critics attempt to classify novels and literary works in only one genre  such as  romantic  or  naturalist   not always taking into account that many works fall into multiple categories  54  Much discussion is cited from Maggie Ann Bowers  book Magic al  Realism  wherein she attempts to delimit the terms magic and magical realism by examining the relationships with other genres such as realism  surrealism  fantastic literature and science fiction   edit  Realism Realism is an attempt to create a depiction of actual life  a novel does not simply rely on what it presents but how it presents it  In this way  a realist narrative acts as framework by which the reader constructs a world using the raw materials of life  Understanding both realism and magical realism within the realm of a narrative mode is key to understanding both terms  Magical realism     relies upon the presentation of real  imagined or magical elements as if they were real  It relies upon realism  but only so that it can stretch what is acceptable as real to its limits   55  As a simple point of comparison  Roh s differentiation between expressionism and post expressionism as described in German Art in the 20th Century  may be applied to magic realism and realism  Realism pertains to the terms  history    mimetic    familiarization    empiricism logic    narration    closure ridden reductive naturalism   and  rationalization cause and effect   56  On the other hand  magic realism encompasses the terms  myth legend    fantastic supplementation    defamiliarization    mysticism magic    meta narration    open ended expansive romanticism   and  imagination negative capability   57   edit  Surrealism Surrealism is often confused with magical realism as they both explore illogical or non realist aspects of humanity and existence  There is a strong historical connection between Franz Roh s concept of magic realism and surrealism  as well as the resulting influence on Carpentier s marvelous reality  however  important differences remain  Surrealism  is most distanced from magical realism  in that  the aspects that it explores are associated not with material reality but with the imagination and the mind  and in particular it attempts to express the  inner life  and psychology of humans through art   It seeks to express the sub conscious  unconscious  the repressed and inexpressible  Magical realism  on the other hand  rarely presents the extraordinary in the form of a dream or a psychological experience   To do so   Bowers writes   takes the magic of recognizable material reality and places it into the little understood world of the imagination  The ordinariness of magical realism s magic relies on its accepted and unquestioned position in tangible and material reality   58   edit  Fantasy Prominent English language fantasy writers have said that  magic realism  is only another name for fantasy fiction  Gene Wolfe said   magic realism is fantasy written by people who speak Spanish   59  and Terry Pratchett said magic realism  is like a polite way of saying you write fantasy   60  However  Amaryll Beatrice Chanady distinguishes magical realist literature from fantasy literature   the fantastic   based on differences between three shared dimensions  the use of antinomy  the simultaneous presence of two conflicting codes   the inclusion of events that cannot be integrated into a logical framework  and the use of authorial reticence  In fantasy  the presence of the supernatural code is perceived as problematic  something that draws special attention where in magical realism  the presence of the supernatural is accepted  In fantasy  authorial reticence creates a disturbing effect on the reader  it works to integrate the supernatural into the natural framework in magical realism  This integration is made possible in magical realism as the author presents the supernatural as being equally valid to the natural  There is no hierarchy between the two codes  61  The ghost of Melqu ades in M rquez s One Hundred Years of Solitude or the baby ghost in Toni Morrison s Beloved who visit or haunt the inhabitants of their previous residence are both presented by the narrator as ordinary occurrences  the reader  therefore  accepts the marvelous as normal and common  62  To Dr  Clark Zlotchew  the differentiating factor between the fantastic and magical realism is that in fantastic literature  such as Kafka s story  The Metamorphosis   there is a hesitation experienced by the protagonist  implied author or reader in deciding whether to attribute natural or supernatural causes to an unsettling event  or between rational or irrational explanations  63  Fantastic literature has also been defined as a piece of narrative in which there is a constant faltering between belief and non belief in the supernatural or extraordinary event  In Leal s view  magical realism has a tropical  or llano  plains  or desert  context  64  but he says that the fiction of Julio Cort zar contains only  the fantastic   not magical realism  65  In Leal s view   In fantastic literature in Borges  for example the writer creates new worlds  perhaps new planets  By contrast  writers like Garc a M rquez  who use magical realism  don t create new worlds  but suggest the magical in our world   66  Even Cort zar s short story  Casa Tomada   about a brother and sister whose house is taken over by someone or something mysterious  for Leal is an example of the fantastic and not magical realism  65   edit  Science fiction While science fiction and magical realism both bend the notion of what is real  toy with human imagination  and are forms of  often fantastical  fiction  they differ greatly  Bower s cites Aldous Huxley s Brave New World as a novel that exemplifies the science fiction novel s requirement of a     rational  physical explanation for any unusual occurrences   Huxley portrays a world where the population is highly controlled with mood enhancing drugs  which are controlled by the government  In this world  there is no link between copulation and reproduction  Humans are produced in giant test tubes  where chemical alterations during gestation determine their fates  Bowers argues that   The science fiction narrative s distinct difference from magical realism is that it is set in a world different from any known reality and its realism resides in the fact that we can recognize it as a possibility for our future  Unlike magical realism  it does not have a realistic setting that is recognizable in relation to any past or present reality   67   edit  Major authors and works Although critics and writers debate which authors or works fall within the magical realism genre  the following authors represent the narrative mode  Franz Kafka  writing in the 1920s  is the genre founder  Within the Latin American world  the most iconic of magical realist novelist is Nobel Laureate Gabriel Garc a M rquez  whose novel One Hundred Years of Solitude was an instant worldwide success  Plaque of Gabriel Garc a M rquez  Paris Garc a M rquez confessed   my most important problem was destroying the line of demarcation that separates what seems real from what seems fantastic   68 Isabel Allende was the first Latin America woman writer recognized outside the continent  Her most well known novel  The House of the Spirits  is arguably similar to Garc a M rquez s style of magical realist writing  Another notable novelist is Laura Esquivel  whose Like Water for Chocolate tells the story of the domestic life of women living on the margins of their families and society  The novel s protagonist  Tita  is kept from happiness and marriage by her mother   Her unrequited love and ostracism from the family lead her to harness her extraordinary powers of imbuing her emotions to the food she makes  In turn  people who eat her food enact her emotions for her  For example  after eating a wedding cake Tita made while suffering from a forbidden love  the guests all suffer from a wave of longing  In the English speaking world  major authors include British Indian writer Salman Rushdie  African American novelist Toni Morrison  English author Louis de Berni res and English feminist writer Angela Carter  Perhaps the best known is Rushdie  whose     language form of magical realism straddles both the surrealist tradition of magic realism as it developed in Europe and the mythic tradition of magical realism as it developed in Latin America   citation needed  Morrison s most notable work  Beloved  tells the story of a mother who  haunted by the ghost of her child  learns to cope with memories of her traumatic childhood as an abused slave and the burden of nurturing children into a harsh and brutal society  8  For a detailed list of authors and works considered magical realist please see Category Magic realism novels  edit  Visual art  edit  Historical development The painterly style began evolving as early as the first decade of the 20th century  69  but 1925 was when magischer realismus and neue sachlichkeit were officially recognized as major trends  This was the year that Franz Roh published his book on the subject  Nach Expressionismus  Magischer Realismus  Probleme der neuesten europ ischen Malerei  translated as After Expressionism  Magical Realism  Problems of the Newest European Painting  and Gustav Hartlaub curated the seminal exhibition on the theme  entitled simply Neue Sachlichkeit  translated as New Objectivity   at the Kunsthalle Mannheim in Mannheim  Germany  70  Irene Guenthe refers most frequently to the New Objectivity  rather than magical realism  which is attributed to that New objectivity is practical based  referential  to real practicing artists   while the magical realism is theoretical or critic s rhetoric  Eventually under Massimo Bontempelli guidance  the term magic realism was fully embraced by the German as well as in Italian practicing communities  71  New Objectivity saw an utter rejection of the preceding impressionist and expressionist movements  and Hartlaub curated his exhibition under the guideline  only those      who have remained true or have returned to a positive  palpable reality   72  in order to reveal the truth of the times   73  would be included  The style was roughly divided into two subcategories  conservative   neo  classicist painting  and generally left wing  politically motivated Verists  73  The following quote by Hartlaub distinguishes the two  though mostly with reference to Germany  however  one might apply the logic to all relevant European countries   In the new art  he saw  73  a right  a left wing  One  conservative towards Classicism  taking roots in timelessness  wanting to sanctify again the healthy  physically plastic in pure drawing after nature   after so much eccentricity and chaos  a reference to the repercussions of World War I     The other  the left  glaringly contemporary  far less artistically faithful  rather born of the negation of art  seeking to expose the chaos  the true face of our time  with an addiction to primitive fact finding and nervous baring of the self    There is nothing left but to affirm it  the new art   especially since it seems strong enough to raise new artistic willpower  74  Both sides were seen all over Europe during the 1920s and 1930s  ranging from the Netherlands to Austria  France to Russia  with Germany and Italy as centers of growth  75  Indeed  Italian Giorgio de Chirico  producing works in the late 1910s under the style arte metafisica  translated as Metaphysical art   is seen as a precursor and as having an  influence   greater than any other painter on the artists of New Objectivity   76  77  Further afield  American painters were later  in the 1940s and 1950s  mostly  coined magical realists  a link between these artists and the Neue Sachlichkeit of the 1920s was explicitly made in the New York Museum of Modern Art exhibition  tellingly titled  American Realists and Magic Realists   78  French magical realist Pierre Roy  who worked and showed successfully in the US  is cited as having  helped spread Franz Roh s formulations  to the United States  79   edit  Magic realism that excludes the overtly fantastic When art critic Franz Roh applied the term magic realism to visual art in 1925  he was designating a style of visual art that brings extreme realism to the depiction of mundane subject matter  revealing an  interior  mystery  rather than imposing external  overtly magical features onto this everyday reality  Roh explains  We are offered a new style that is thoroughly of this world that celebrates the mundane  This new world of objects is still alien to the current idea of Realism  It employs various techniques that endow all things with a deeper meaning and reveal mysteries that always threaten the secure tranquility of simple and ingenuous things     it is a question of representing before our eyes  in an intuitive way  the fact  the interior figure  of the exterior world  80  In painting  magical realism is a term often interchanged with post expressionism  as R os also shows  for the very title of Roh s 1925 essay was  Magical Realism Post Expressionism   80  Indeed  as Dr  Lois Parkinson Zamora of the University of Houston writes   Roh  in his 1925 essay  described a group of painters whom we now categorize generally as Post Expressionists    11  Alexander Kanoldt  Still Life II 1922 Roh used this term to describe painting that signaled a return to realism after expressionism s extravagances  which sought to redesign objects to reveal the spirits of those objects  Magical realism  according to Roh  instead faithfully portrays the exterior of an object  and in doing so the spirit  or magic  of the object reveals itself  One could relate this exterior magic all the way back to the 15th century  Flemish painter Van Eyck  1395 1441  highlights the complexity of a natural landscape by creating illusions of continuous and unseen areas that recede into the background  leaving it to the viewer s imagination to fill in those gaps in the image  for instance  in a rolling landscape with river and hills  The magic is contained in the viewer s interpretation of those mysterious unseen or hidden parts of the image  81  Other important aspects of magical realist painting  according to Roh  include  A return to ordinary subjects as opposed to fantastical ones  A juxtaposition of forward movement with a sense of distance  as opposed to Expressionism s tendency to foreshorten the subject  A use of miniature details even in expansive paintings  such as large landscapes  The pictorial ideals of Roh s original magic realism attracted new generations of artists through the latter years of the 20th century and beyond  In a 1991 New York Times review  critic Vivien Raynor remarked that  John Stuart Ingle proves that Magic Realism lives  in his  virtuoso  still life watercolors  82  Ingle s approach  as described in his own words  reflects the early inspiration of the magic realism movement as described by Roh  that is  the aim is not to add magical elements to a realistic painting  but to pursue a radically faithful rendering of reality  the  magic  effect on the viewer comes from the intensity of that effort   I don t want to make arbitrary changes in what I see to paint the picture  I want to paint what is given  The whole idea is to take something that s given and explore that reality as intensely as I can    83  84   edit  Later development  magic realism that incorporates the fantastic Paul Cadmus  The Fleet s In  1934 While Ingle represents a  magic realism  that harks back to Roh s ideas  the term  magic realism  in mid 20th century visual art tends to refer to work that incorporates overtly fantastic elements  somewhat in the manner of its literary counterpart  Occupying an intermediate place in this line of development  the work of several European and American painters whose most important work dates from the 1930s through to the 1950s  including Bettina Shaw Lawrence  Paul Cadmus  Ivan Albright  Philip Evergood  George Tooker  Ricco  even Andrew Wyeth  is designated as  magic realist   This work departs sharply from Roh s definition  in that it  according to artcyclopedia com   is anchored in everyday reality  but has overtones of fantasy or wonder    85  In the work of Cadmus  for example  the surreal atmosphere is sometimes achieved via stylized distortions or exaggerations that are not realistic  Recent  magic realism  has gone beyond mere  overtones  of the fantastic or surreal to depict a frankly magical reality  with an increasingly tenuous anchoring in  everyday reality   Artists associated with this kind of magic realism include Marcela Donoso 86  87  88  89  90  and Gregory Gillespie  91  92  93  Artists such as Peter Doig  Richard T  Scott and Will Teather have become associated with the term in the early 21st century   edit  Painters Felice Casorati Antonio Donghi Marcela Donoso Gian Paolo Dulbecco Jared French Edward Hopper Gayane Khachaturian Ricco Carel Willink  edit  Film Magical realism is not an officially recognized film category  it is a literary film genre  It is presented matter of factly and occurs without explanation  94  Critics have recognized magical realism features in many films by applying the magical realism characteristics  Many films have magical realist narrative and events that contrast between real and magical elements  or different modes of production  This device explores the reality of what exists  95  Fredrick Jameson   On Magic Realism in Film  advances a hypothesis that magical realism in film is a formal mode that is constitutionally depended on a type of historical raw material in which disjunction is structurally present  96 Like Water for Chocolate begins and ends with the first person narrative to establishing the magical realism storytelling frame  Telling a story from a child point of view  the historical gaps and holes perspective  and with cinematic color heightening the presence  are magical realism tools in films  97  Other films that convey elements of magic realism are Am lie and Midnight in Paris   edit  See
