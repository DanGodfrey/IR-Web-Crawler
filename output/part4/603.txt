and centered on the eight block long street running from Broadway to South Street on the East River in Lower Manhattan  Over time  the term has become a metonym for the financial markets of the United States as a whole  or signifying New York based financial interests  2  It is the home of the New York Stock Exchange  the world s largest stock exchange by market capitalization of its listed companies  3  Several other major exchanges have or had headquarters in the Wall Street area  including NASDAQ  the New York Mercantile Exchange  the New York Board of Trade  and the former American Stock Exchange  Anchored by Wall Street  New York City is one of the world s principal financial centers  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  Contents 1 History 1 1 Early years 1 2 Nineteenth century 1 3

 edit  Early years There are varying accounts about how the Dutch named  de Waal Straat  12  got its name  A generally accepted version is that the name of the street name was derived from an earthen wall on the northern boundary of the New Amsterdam settlement  perhaps to protect against English colonial encroachment or incursions by native Americans  A conflicting explanation is that Wall Street was named after Walloons    possibly a Dutch abbreviation for Walloon being Waal  13  Among the first settlers that embarked on the ship  Nieu Nederlandt  in 1624 were 30 Walloon families  In the 1640s  basic picket and plank fences denoted plots and residences in the colony  14  Later  on behalf of the Dutch West India Company  Peter Stuyvesant  using both African slaves 15  and white colonists  collaborated with the city government in the construction of a more substantial fortification  a strengthened 12 foot  4 m  wall  16  In 1685 surveyors laid out Wall Street along the lines of the original stockade  16  The wall started at Pearl Street  which was the shoreline at that time  crossing the Indian path Broadway and ending at the other shoreline  today s Trinity Place   where it took a turn south and ran along the shore until it ended at the old fort  In these early days  local merchants and traders would gather at disparate spots to buy and sell shares and bonds  and over time divided themselves into two classes auctioneers and dealers  17  The rampart was removed in 1699  13  In the late 18th century  there was a buttonwood tree at the foot of Wall Street under which traders and speculators would gather to trade securities  18  The benefit was being in close proximity to each other  18  In 1792  traders formalized their association with the Buttonwood Agreement which was the origin of the New York Stock Exchange  19  The idea of the agreement was to make the market more  structured  and  without the manipulative auctions   with a commission structure  17  Persons signing the agreement agreed to charge each other a standard commission rate  persons not signing could still participate but would be charged a higher commission for dealing  17  In 1789  Wall Street was the scene of the United States  first presidential inauguration when George Washington took the oath of office on the balcony of Federal Hall on April 30  1789  This was also the location of the passing of the Bill Of Rights  In the cemetery of Trinity Church  Alexander Hamilton  who was the first Treasury secretary and  architect of the early United States financial system   is buried  20   edit  Nineteenth century In the first few decades  both residences and businesses occupied the area  but increasingly business predominated   There are old stories of people s houses being surrounded by the clamor of business and trade and the owners complaining that they can t get anything done   according to a historian named Burrows  21  The opening of the Erie Canal in the early 19th century meant a huge boom in business for New York City  since it was the only major eastern seaport which had direct access by inland waterways to ports on the Great Lakes  Wall Street became the  money capital of America   18  Historian Charles R  Geisst suggested that there has constantly been a  tug of war  between business interests on Wall Street and authorities in Washington  D C   17  Generally during the 19th century Wall Street developed its own  unique personality and institutions  with little outside interference  17  In the 1840s and 1850s  most residents moved north to midtown because of the increased business use at the lower tip of the island  21  The Civil War had the effect of causing the northern economy to boom  bringing greater prosperity to cities like New York which  came into its own as the nation s banking center  connecting  Old World capital and New World ambition   according to one account  20 J  P  Morgan created giant trusts  John D  Rockefeller s Standard Oil moved to New York  20  Between 1860 and 1920  the economy changed from  agricultural to industrial to financial  and New York maintained its leadership position despite these changes  according to historian Thomas Kessner  20  New York was second only to London as the world s financial capital  20  In 1884  Charles H  Dow began tracking stocks  initially beginning with 11 stocks  mostly railroads  and looked at average prices for these eleven  22  When the average  peaks and troughs  went up consistently  he deemed it a bull market condition  if averages dropped  it was a bear market  22  He added up prices  and divided by the number of stocks to get his Dow Jones average  Dow s numbers were a  convenient benchmark  for analyzing the market and became an accepted way to look at the entire stock market  22  In 1889  the original stock report  Customers  Afternoon Letter  became The Wall Street Journal  Named in reference to the actual street  it became an influential international daily business newspaper published in New York City  23  After October 7  1896  it began publishing Dow s expanded list of stocks  22  A century later  there were 30 stocks in the average   edit  Twentieth century Historian John Brooks in his book Once in Golconda considered the turn of the 20th century period to have been Wall Street s heyday  20  The address of 23 Wall Street where the headquarters of J  P  Morgan  amp  Company  known as The Corner  was  the precise center  geographical as well as metaphorical  of financial America and even of the financial world   20  Wall Street has had changing relationships with government authorities  In 1913  for example  when authorities proposed a  4 tax on stock transfers  stock clerks protested  24  At other times  city and state officials have taken steps through tax incentives to encourage financial firms to continue to do business in the city  In the late 19th and early 20th centuries  the corporate culture of New York was a primary center for the construction of skyscrapers  and was rivaled only by Chicago on the American continent  There were also residential sections  such as the Bowling Green section between Broadway and the Hudson river  and between Vesey Street and the Battery  The Bowling Green area was described as  Wall Street s back yard  with poor people  high infant mortality rates  and the  worst housing conditions in the city   25  As a result of the construction  looking at New York City from the east  one can see two distinct clumps of tall buildings the financial district on the left  and the taller midtown district on the right  The geology of Manhattan is well suited for tall buildings  with a solid mass of bedrock underneath Manhattan providing a firm foundation for tall buildings  Skyscrapers are expensive to build  but when there is a  short supply of land  in a  desirable location   then building upwards makes sound financial sense  26  A post office was built at 60 Wall Street in 1905  27  During the World War I years  occasionally there were fund raising efforts for projects such as the National Guard  28  On September 16  1920  close to the corner of Wall and Broad Street  the busiest corner of the financial district and across the offices of the Morgan Bank  a powerful bomb exploded  It killed 38 and seriously injured 143 people  29  The perpetrators were never identified or apprehended  The explosion did  however  help fuel the Red Scare that was underway at the time  A report from the New York Times    The tomb like silence that settles over Wall Street and lower Broadway with the coming of night and the suspension of business was entirely changed last night as hundreds of men worked under the glare of searchlights to repair the damage to skyscrapers that were lighted up from top to bottom      The Assay Office  nearest the point of explosion  naturally suffered the most  The front was pierced in fifty places where the cast iron slugs  which were of the material used for window weights  were thrown against it  Each slug penetrated the stone an inch or two and chipped off pieces ranging from three inches to a foot in diameter  The ornamental iron grill work protecting each window was broken or shattered      the Assay Office was a wreck      It was as though some gigantic force had overturned the building and then placed it upright again  leaving the framework uninjured but scrambling everything inside     1920 30    The area was subjected to numerous threats  one bomb threat in 1921 led to detectives sealing off the area to  prevent a repetition of the Wall Street bomb explosion   31  A crowd at Wall and Broad streets after the 1929 crash  The New York Stock Exchange is on the right  The majority of people are congregating in Wall Street on the left between the  House of Morgan   23 Wall Street  and Federal Hall  26 Wall Street    edit  Regulation In October 1929  a celebrated Yale economist named Irving Fisher reassured worried investors that their  money was safe  on Wall Street  32  A few days later  stock values plummeted  The stock market crash of 1929 ushered in the Great Depression in which a quarter of working people were unemployed  with soup kitchens  mass foreclosures of farms  and falling prices  32  During this era  development of the financial district stagnated  and Wall Street  paid a heavy price  and  became something of a backwater in American life   32  During the New Deal years as well as the forties  there was much less focus on Wall Street and finance  The government clamped down on the practice of buying equities based only on credit  but these policies began to ease  From 1946 1947  stocks could not be purchased  on margin   meaning that an investor had to pay 100  of a stock s cost without taking on any loans  33  But this margin requirement was reduced four times before 1960  each time stimulating a mini rally and boosting volume  and when the Federal Reserve reduced the margin requirements from 90  to 70   33  These changes made it somewhat easier for investors to buy stocks on credit  33  The growing national economy and prosperity led to a recovery during the sixties  with some down years during the early seventies in the aftermath of the Vietnam War  Trading volumes climbed  in 1967  according to Time Magazine  volume hit 7 5 million shares a day which caused a  traffic jam  of paper with  batteries of clerks  working overtime to  clear transactions and update customer accounts   34  In 1973  the financial community posted a collective loss of  245 million  which spurred temporary help from the government  35  Reforms happened  the SEC eliminated fixed commissions which forced  brokers to compete freely with one another for investors  business   35  In 1975  the Securities  amp  Exchange Commission threw out the NYSE s  Rule 394  which had required that  most stock transactions take place on the Big Board s floor   in effect freeing up trading for electronic methods  36  In 1976  banks were allowed to buy and sell stocks  which provided more competition for stockbrokers  36  Reforms had the effect of lowering prices overall  making it easier for more people to participate in the stock market  36  Broker commissions for each stock sale lessened  but volume increased  35  The Reagan years were marked by a renewed push for capitalism  business  with national efforts to de regulate industries such as telecommunications and aviation  The economy resumed upward growth after a period in the early eighties of languishing  A report in the New York Times described that the flushness of money and growth during these years had spawned a drug culture of sorts  with a rampant acceptance of cocaine use although the overall percent of actual users was most likely small  A reporter wrote    The Wall Street drug dealer looked like many other successful young female executives  Stylishly dressed and wearing designer sunglasses  she sat in her 1983 Chevrolet Camaro in a no parking zone across the street from the Marine Midland Bank branch on lower Broadway  The customer in the passenger seat looked like a successful young businessman  But as the dealer slipped him a heat sealed plastic envelope of cocaine and he passed her cash  the transaction was being watched through the sunroof of her car by Federal drug agents in a nearby building  And the customer   an undercover agent himself  was learning the ways  the wiles and the conventions of Wall Street s drug subculture     Peter Kerr in the New York Times  1987  37    In 1987  the stock market plunged 18  and  in the relatively brief recession following  lower Manhattan lost 100 000 jobs according to one estimate  38  Since telecommunications costs were coming down  banks and brokerage firms could move away from Wall Street to more affordable locations  38  The recession of 1990 1991 were marked by office vacancy rates downtown which were  persistently high  and with some buildings  standing empty   21  The day of the drop  October 20  was marked by  stony faced traders whose sense of humor had abandoned them and in the exhaustion of stock exchange employees struggling to maintain orderly trading   39  Ironically  it was the same year that Oliver Stone s movie Wall Street appeared  In 1995  city authorities offered the Lower Manhattan Revitalization Plan which offered incentives to convert commercial properties to residential use  21  Construction of the World Trade Center began in 1966 but had trouble attracting tenants when completed  Nonetheless  some substantial firms purchased space there  Its impressive height helped make it a visual landmark for drivers and pedestrians  In some respects  the nexus of the financial district moved from the street of Wall Street to the Trade Center complex  Real estate growth during the latter part of the 1990s was significant  with deals and new projects happening in the financial district and elsewhere in Manhattan  one firm invested more than  24 billion in various projects  many in the Wall Street area  40  In 1998  the NYSE and the city struck a  900 million deal which kept the NYSE from moving across the river to Jersey City  the deal was described as the  largest in city history to prevent a corporation from leaving town   41  A competitor to the NYSE  NASDAQ  moved its headquarters from Washington to New York  42  Lower Manhattan skyline from the Hudson River  The Wall Street area from the air in 2009  Wall Street area from Brooklyn  the South Street Seaport is at the lower middle slight right   edit  Twenty first century In the first year of the new century  the Big Board  as some termed the NYSE  was described as the world s  largest and most prestigious stock market   43  But when the World Trade Center was destroyed on September 11th  it left an architectural void as new developments since the 1970s had played off the complex aesthetically  The attacks  crippled  the communications network  43  One estimate was that 45  of Wall Street s  best office space  had been lost  18  The physical destruction was immense    Debris littered some streets of the financial district  National Guard members in camouflage uniforms manned checkpoints  Abandoned coffee carts  glazed with dust from the collapse of the World Trade Center  lay on their sides across sidewalks  Most subway stations were closed  most lights were still off  most telephones did not work  and only a handful of people walked in the narrow canyons of Wall Street yesterday morning     Leslie Eaton and Kirk Johnson of the New York Times  September 16  2001  44    Still  the NYSE was determined to re open on September 17  almost a week after the attack  44  The attack hastened a trend towards financial firms moving to midtown and contributed to the loss of business on Wall Street  due to temporary to permanent relocation to New Jersey and further decentralization with establishments transferred to cities like Chicago  Denver  and Boston  After September 11  the financial services industry went through a downturn with a sizable drop in year end bonuses of  6 5 billion  according to one estimate from a state comptroller s office  45  Many brokers are paid mostly through commission  and get a token annual salary which is dwarfed by the year end bonus  To guard against a vehicular bombing in the area  authorities built concrete barriers  and found ways over time to make them more aesthetically appealing by spending  5000 to  8000 apiece on bollards    To prevent a vehicle delivered bomb from entering the area  Rogers Marvel designed a new kind of bollard  a faceted piece of sculpture whose broad  slanting surfaces offer people a place to sit in contrast to the typical bollard  which is supremely unsittable  The bollard  which is called the Nogo  looks a bit like one of Frank Gehry s unorthodox culture palaces  but it is hardly insensitive to its surroundings  Its bronze surfaces actually echo the grand doorways of Wall Street s temples of commerce  Pedestrians easily slip through groups of them as they make their way onto Wall Street from the area around historic Trinity Church  Cars  however  cannot pass     Blair Kamin in the Chicago Tribune  2006 46    Wall Street itself and the Financial District as a whole are crowded with highrises  Further  the loss of the World Trade Center has spurred development on a scale that hadn t been seen in decades  In 2006  Goldman Sachs began building a tower near the former Trade Center site  26  Tax incentives provided by federal  state and local governments encouraged development  A new World Trade Center complex  centered on Daniel Liebeskind s Memory Foundations plan  is in the early stages of development and one building has already been replaced  The centerpiece to this plan is the 1 776 foot  541 m  tall 1 World Trade Center  formerly known as the Freedom Tower   New residential buildings are sprouting up  and buildings that were previously office space are being converted to residential units  also benefiting from tax incentives  A new Fulton Street Transit Center is planned to improve access  In 2007  the Maharishi Global Financial Capital of New York opened headquarters at 70 Broad Street near the NYSE  in an effort to seek investors  47  The Guardian reporter Andrew Clark described the years of 2006 to 2010 as  tumultous  in which the heartland of America is  mired in gloom  with high unemployment around 9 6   with average house prices falling from  230 000 in 2006 to  183 000  and foreboding increases in the national debt to  13 4 trillion  but that despite the setbacks  the American economy was once more  bouncing back   48  What had happened during these heady years  Clark wrote    But the picture is too nuanced simply to dump all the responsibility on financiers  Most Wall Street banks didn t actually go around the US hawking dodgy mortgages  they bought and packaged loans from on the ground firms such as Countrywide Financial and New Century Financial  both of which hit a financial wall in the crisis  Foolishly and recklessly  the banks didn t look at these loans adequately  relying on flawed credit rating agencies such as Standard  amp  Poor s and Moody s  which blithely certified toxic mortgage backed securities as solid    A few of those on Wall Street  including maverick hedge fund manager John Paulson and the top brass at Goldman Sachs  spotted what was going on and ruthlessly gambled on a crash  They made a fortune but turned into the crisis s pantomime villains  Most  though  got burned   the banks are still gradually running down portfolios of non core loans worth  800bn     The Guardian reporter Andrew Clark  2010  48    The first months of 2008 was a particularly troublesome period which caused Federal Reserve chairman Benjamin Bernanke to  work holidays and weekends  and which did an  extraordinary series of moves   49  It bolstered U S  banks and allowed Wall Street firms to borrow  directly from the Fed   49  These efforts were highly controversial at the time  but from the perspective of 2010  it appeared the Federal exertions had been the right decisions  By 2010  Wall Street firms  in Clark s view  were  getting back to their old selves as engine rooms of wealth  prosperity and excess   48  A report by Michael Stoler in The New York Sun described a  phoenix like resurrection  of the area  with residential  commercial  retail and hotels booming in the  third largest business district in the country   50  At the same time  the investment community was worried about proposed legal reforms  including the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which dealt with matters such as credit card rates and lending requirements  51  The NYSE closed two of its trading floors in a move towards transforming itself into an electronic exchange  20  Beginning in September 2011  demonstrators disenchanted with the financial system protested in parks and plazas around Wall Street  52   edit  Buildings  Physical layout Federal Hall  Wall Street  Wall Street s architecture is generally rooted in the Gilded Age  though there are also some art deco influences in the neighborhood  The layout of streets doesn t have the rectangular grid pattern typical of midtown Manhattan  but small streets  barely wide enough for a single lane of traffic are bordered on both sides by some of the tallest buildings in the city   according to one description  which creates  breathtaking artificial canyons  offering spectacular views in some instances  21  Construction in such narrow steep areas has resulted in occasional accidents such as a crane collapse  53  One report divided lower Manhattan into three basic districts  21  The financial district proper particularly along John Street South of the World Trade Center area the handful of blocks south of the World Trade Center along Greenwich  Washington and West Streets Seaport district characterized by century old low rise buildings and South Street Seaport  the seaport is  quiet  residential  and has an old world charm  according to one description  21  Landmark buildings on Wall Street include Federal Hall  14 Wall Street  Bankers Trust Company Building   40 Wall Street  The Trump Building  the New York Stock Exchange at the corner of Broad Street and the US headquarters of Deutsche Bank at 60 Wall Street  The Deutsche Bank building  formerly the J P Morgan headquarters  is the last remaining major investment bank to still have its headquarters on Wall Street  The older skyscrapers often were built with elaborate facades  such elaborate aesthetics haven t been common in corporate architecture for decades  The World Trade Center  built in the 1970s  was very plain and utilitarian in comparison  the Twin Towers were often criticized as looking like two big boxes  despite their impressive height   Excavation from the World Trade Center was later used by Battery Park City residential development as landfill  18 23 Wall Street was built in 1914 and was known as the  House of Morgan  and served for decades as the bank s headquarters and  by some accounts  was viewed as an important address in American finance  A key anchor for the area is  of course  the New York Stock Exchange  City authorities realize its importance  and believed that it has  outgrown its neoclassical temple at the corner of Wall and Broad streets   and in 1998 offered substantial tax incentives to try to keep it in the financial district  18  Plans to rebuild it were delayed by the events of 2001  18  In 2011  the exchange still occupies the same site  The exchange is the locus for an impressive amount of technology and data  For example  to accommodate the three thousand persons who work directly on the Exchange floor requires 3 500 kilowatts of electricity  along with 8 000 phone circuits on the trading floor alone  and 200 miles of fiber optic cable below ground  44   edit  Personalities  players and deal makers Persons associated with Wall Street have become famous  Although their reputations are usually limited to members of the stock brokerage and banking communities  several have gained national and international fame  Some earned their fame for their investment strategies  financing  reporting  legal or regulatory skills  while others are remembered for their greed  54  One of the most iconic representations of the market prosperity is the Charging Bull sculpture  by Arturo Di Modica  Representing the bull market economy  the sculpture was originally placed in front of the New York Stock Exchange  and subsequently moved to its current location in Bowling Green  Wall Street s culture is often criticized as being rigid  This is a decades old stereotype stemming from the Wall Street establishment s protection of its interests  and the link to the WASP establishment  More recent criticism has centered on structural problems and lack of a desire to change well established habits  Wall Street s establishment resists government oversight and regulation  At the same time  New York City has a reputation as a very bureaucratic city  which makes entry into the neighborhood difficult or even impossible for middle class entrepreneurs  Michael Bloomberg was affiliated with Salomon Brothers before launching his own firm Bloomberg News and later becoming mayor  Several well known Wall Street individuals include John Meriwether  John Briggs  Michael Bloomberg  and Warren Buffett  All affiliated at one time or another with the firm Salomon Brothers   as well as Bernie Madoff  and numerous others  Many talented financiers and bankers worked for Wasserstein Perella  amp  Co  during the 1980s  The now defunct investment bank of Donaldson  Lufkin  amp  Jenrette had numerous talented people working there including people such as William Donaldson who served in the Nixon administration  as well as Ken Moelis  Bennett Goodman  Herald  Hal  Ritch  Joel Cohen  Safra A  Catz who became president of Oracle Corporation  Tom Dean  Larry Schloss  Michael Connelly  and others  55   edit  Wall Street as a financial center Further information  Financial District  Manhattan  edit  Wall Street in the New York economy Finance professor Charles R  Geisst wrote that the exchange has become  inextricably intertwined into New York s economy   43  Wall Street pay  in terms of salaries and bonuses and taxes  is an important part of the economy of New York City  the tri state metropolitan area  and the United States  In 2008  after a downturn in the stock market  the decline meant  18 billion less in taxable income  with less money available for  apartments  furniture  cars  clothing and services   45  A falloff in Wall Street s economy could have  wrenching effects on the local and regional economies   45  Estimates vary about the number and quality of financial jobs in the city  One estimate was that Wall Street firms employed close to 200 000 persons in 2008  45  Another estimate was that in 2007  the financial services industry which had a  70 billion profit became 22 percent of the city s revenue  56  Another estimate  in 2006  was that the financial services industry makes up 9  of the city s work force and 31  of the tax base  57  An additional estimate  2007  from Steve Malanga of the Manhattan Institute was that the securities industry accounts for 4 7 percent of the jobs in New York City but 20 7 percent of its wages  and he estimated there were 175 000 securities industries jobs in New York  both Wall Street area and midtown  paying an average of  350 000 annually  20  Between 1995 and 2005  the sector grew at an annual rate of about 6 6  annually  a respectable rate  but that other financial centers were growing faster  20  Another estimate  2008  was that Wall Street provided a fourth of all personal income earned in the city  and 10  of New York City s tax revenue  58  The seven largest Wall Street firms in the first decade of the 21st century were Bear Stearns  JPMorgan Chase  Citigroup Incorporated  Goldman Sachs  Morgan Stanley  Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers  45  During the recession of 2008 2010  many of these firms went out of business or were bought up at firesale prices by other financial firms  In 2008  Lehman filed for bankruptcy  48 Bear Stearns was bought up by JP Morgan Chase 48  with blessing by the U S  government  49  and Merrill Lynch was bought up by Bank of America  These failures marked a catastrophic downsizing of Wall Street as the financial industry goes through restructuring and change  Since New York s financial industry provides almost one fourth of all income produced in the city  and accounts for 10  of the city s tax revenues and 20  of the state s  the downturn has had huge repercussions for government treasuries  45  New York s mayor Michael Bloomberg reportedly over a four year period dangled over  100 million in tax incentives to persuade Goldman Sachs to build a 43 story headquarters in the financial district near the destroyed World Trade Center site  56  In 2009  things looked somewhat gloomy  with one analysis by the Boston Consulting Group suggesting that 65 000 jobs had been permanently lost because of the downturn  59  But there were signs that Manhattan property prices were rebounding with price rises of 9  annually in 2010  and bonuses were being paid once more  with average bonuses over  124 000 in 2010  48  The U S  banking industry employes 1 86 million people and earned profits of  22 billion in the second quarter of 2010  up substantially from previous quarters  48   edit  Wall Street versus Midtown Manhattan A requirement of the New York Stock Exchange was that brokerage firms had to have offices  clustered around Wall Street  so clerks could deliver physical paper copies of stock certificates each week  18  There were some indications that midtown had been becoming the locus of financial services dealings even by 1911  60  But as technology progressed  in the middle and later decades of the 20th century  computers and telecommunications replaced paper notifications  meaning that the close proximity requirement could be bypassed in more situations  18  Many financial firms found that they could move to midtown Manhattan four miles away 21  or elsewhere and still operate effectively  For example  the former investment firm of Donaldson  Lufkin  amp  Jenrette was described as a Wall Street firm but had its headquarters on Park Avenue in midtown  55  A report described the migration from Wall Street    The financial industry has been slowly migrating from its historic home in the warren of streets around Wall Street to the more spacious and glamorous office towers of Midtown Manhattan  Morgan Stanley  J P  Morgan Chase  Citigroup  and Bear Stearns have all moved north     USA Today  October 2001  18    Nevertheless  a key magnet for the Wall Street remains the New York Stock Exchange  Some  old guard  firms such as Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch  bought by Bank of America in 2009   have remained  fiercely loyal to the financial district  location  and new ones such as Deutsche Bank have chosen office space in the district  18  So called  face to face  trading between buyers and sellers remains a  cornerstone  of the NYSE  with a benefit of having all of a deal s players close at hand  including investment bankers  lawyers  and accountants  18  In 2011  the Manhattan Financial District is one of the largest business districts in the United States  and second in New York City only to Midtown in terms of dollar volume of business transacted   edit  Wall Street as a neighborhood Battery Park City is a residential area built on reclaimed land along the Hudson River in lower Manhattan featuring jogging trails as well as residential apartments  Stuyvesant High School  During most of the 20th century  Wall Street was a business community with practically only offices which emptied out at night  A report in the New York Times in 1961 described a  deathlike stillness that settles on the district after 5 30 and all day Saturday and Sunday   21  But there has been a change towards greater residential use of the area  pushed forwards by technological changes and shifting market conditions  The general pattern is for several hundred thousand workers to commute into the area during the day  sometimes by sharing a taxicab 61  from other parts of the city as well as from New Jersey and Long Island  and then leave at night  In 1970  only 833 people lived  south of Chambers Street   by 1990  13 782 people were residents with the addition of areas such as Battery Park City 18  and Southbridge Towers  38  Battery Park City was built on 92 acres of landfill  and 3 000 people moved there beginning about 1982  but by 1986 there was evidence of more shops and stores and a park  along with plans for more residential development  62  According to one description in 1996   The area dies at night     It needs a neighborhood  a community   38  During the past two decades there has been a shift towards greater residential living areas in the Wall Street area  with incentives from city authorities in some instances  18  Many empty office buildings have been converted to lofts and apartments  for example  the office building of Harry Sinclair  the oil magnate involved with the Teapot Dome scandal  was converted to a co op in 1979  38  In 1996  a fifth of buildings and warehouses were empty  and many were converted to living areas  38  Some conversions met with problems  such as aging gargoyles on building exteriors having to be expensively restored to meet with current building codes  38  Residents in the area have sought to have a supermarket  a movie theater  a pharmacy  more schools  and a  good diner   38  The discount retailer named Job Lot used to be located at the World Trade Center but moved to Church Street  merchants bought extra unsold items at steep prices and sold them as a discount to consumers and shoppers included  thrifty homemakers and browsing retirees  who  rubbed elbows with City Hall workers and Wall Street executives   but the firm went bust in 1993  45  There were reports that the number of residents increased by 60  during the 1990s to about 25 000 18  although a second estimate  based on the 2000 census based on a different map  places the residential  nighttime and weekend  population in 2000 at 12 042  21  By 2001  there were several grocery stores  dry cleaners  and two grade schools and a top high school  18  There is a barber shop across from the New York Stock Exchange which has been there a long time  63  By 2001  there were more signs of dogwalkers at night and a 24 hour neighborhood  although the general pattern of crowds during the working hours and emptiness at night was still apparent  21  There were ten hotels and thirteen museums by 2001  21 Stuyvesant High School moved to its present location near Battery Park City in 1992 and has been described as one of the nation s premier high schools with emphasis on science and mathematics  21  In 2007  the French fashion retailer Herm s opened a store in the financial district to sell items such as a   4 700 custom made leather dressage saddle or a  47 000 limited edition alligator briefcase   64  Some streets have been designated as pedestrian only with vehicular traffic prohibited at some times  64  There are reports of panhandlers like elsewhere in the city  65  By 2010  the residential population had increased to 24 400 residents 66  with crime statistics showing no murders in 2010  66  The area is growing with luxury high end apartments and upscale retailers  50   edit  Wall Street as a tourist destination Wall Street is a major location of tourism in New York City  One report described lower Manhattan as  swarming with camera carrying tourists   67  Tour guides highlight places such as Trinity Church  the Federal Reserve gold vaults 80 feet below street level  worth  100 billion   and the NYSE  68  A Scoundrels of Wall Street Tour is a walking historical tour which includes a museum visit and discussion of various financiers  who were adept at finding ways around finance laws or loopholes through them   69  Occasionally artists make impromptu performances  for example  in 2010  a troupe of 22 dancers  contort their bodies and cram themselves into the nooks and crannies of the Financial District in Bodies in Urban Spaces  choreographed by Willi Donner  70  One chief attraction  the Federal Reserve Building in lower Manhattan  paid  750 000 to open a visitors  gallery in 1997  71  The New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange also spent money in the late 1990s to upgrade facilities for visitors  71  Attractions include the gold vault beneath the Federal Reserve and that  staring down at the trading floor was as exciting as going to the Statue of Liberty   71   edit  Wall Street versus Main Street Not just a metonym  Wall Street has a sign post  As a figure of speech contrasted to  Main Street   the term  Wall Street  can refer to big business interests against those of small business and the working of middle class  It is sometimes used more specifically to refer to research analysts  shareholders  and financial institutions such as investment banks  Whereas  Main Street  conjures up images of locally owned businesses and banks  the phrase  Wall Street  is commonly used interchangeably with the phrase  Corporate America   It is also sometimes used in contrast to distinguish between the interests  culture  and lifestyles of investment banks and those of Fortune 500 industrial or service corporations   edit  Wall Street in the public imagination Trinity church from Wall Street  Wall Street in a conceptual sense represents financial and economic power  To Americans  it can sometimes represent elitism and power politics  and its role has been a source of controversy throughout the nation s history  particularly beginning around the Gilded Age period in the late 19th century  Wall Street became the symbol of a country and economic system that many Americans see as having developed through trade  capitalism  and innovation  72  Wall Street has become synonymous with financial interests  often used negatively  73  During the mortgage mess from 2007 2010  Wall Street financing was blamed as one of the causes  although most commentators blame an interplay of factors  The U S  government with the Troubled Asset Relief Program bailed out the banks and financial backers with billions of taxpayer dollars  but the bailout was often criticized as politically motivated  73  and was criticized by journalists as well as the public  Analyst Robert Kuttner in the Huffington Post criticized the bailout as helping large Wall Street firms such as Citigroup while neglecting to help smaller community development banks such as Chicago s ShoreBank  73  One writer in the Huffington Post looked at FBI statistics on robbery  fraud  and crime and concluded that Wall Street was the  most dangerous neighborhood in the United States  if one factored in the  50 billion fraud perpetrated by Bernie Madoff  24  When large firms such as Enron  WorldCom and Global Crossing were found guilty of fraud  Wall Street was often blamed  32  even though these firms had headquarters around the nation and not in Wall Street  Many complained that the resulting Sarbanes Oxley legislation dampened the business climate with regulations that were  overly burdensome   74  Interest groups seeking favor with Washington lawmakers  such as car dealers  have often sought to portray their interests as allied with Main Street rather than Wall Street  although analyst Peter Overby on National Public Radio suggested that car dealers have written over  250 billion in consumer loans and have real ties with Wall Street  75  When the United States Treasury bailed out large financial firms  to ostensibly halt a downward spiral in the nation s economy  there was tremendous negative political fallout  particularly when reports came out that monies supposed to be used to ease credit restrictions were being used to pay bonuses to highly paid employees  62  Analyst William D  Cohan argued that it was  obscene  how Wall Street reaped  massive profits and bonuses in 2009  after being saved by  trillions of dollars of American taxpayers  treasure  despite Wall Street s  greed and irresponsible risk taking   76 Washington Post reporter Suzanne McGee called for Wall Street to make a sort of public apology to the nation  and expressed dismay that people such as Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein hadn t expressed contrition despite being sued by the SEC in 2009  77  McGee wrote that  Bankers aren t the sole culprits  but their too glib denials of responsibility and the occasional vague and waffling expression of regret don t go far enough to deflect anger   77  US headquarters of Deutsche Bank on Wall Street in 2010  But chief banking analyst at Goldman Sachs  Richard Ramsden  is  unapologetic  and sees  banks as the dynamos that power the rest of the economy   48  Ramsden believes  risk taking is vital  and said in 2010    You can construct a banking system in which no bank will ever fail  in which there s no leverage  But there would be a cost  There would be virtually no economic growth because there would be no credit creation     Richard Ramsden of Goldman Sachs  2010  48    Others in the financial industry believe they ve been unfairly castigated by the public and by politicians  For example  Anthony Scaramucci reportedly told President Barack Obama in 2010 that he felt like a pi ata   whacked with a stick  by  hostile politicians   48  The financial misdeeds of various figures throughout American history sometimes casts a dark shadow on financial investing as a whole  and include names such as William Duer  Jim Fisk and Jay Gould  the latter two believed to have been involved with an effort to collapse the U S  gold market in 1869  as well as modern figures such as Bernard Madoff who  bilked billions from investors   69  In addition  images of Wall Street and its figures have loomed large  The 1987 Oliver Stone film Wall Street created the iconic figure of Gordon Gekko who used the phrase  greed is good   which caught on in the cultural parlance  78  According to one account  the Gekko character was a  straight lift  from the real world junk bond dealer Michael Milkin  32  who later pled guilty to felony charges for violating securities laws  Stone commented in 2009 how the movie had had an unexpected cultural influence  not causing them to turn away from corporate greed  but causing many young people to choose Wall Street careers because of that movie  78  A reporter repeated other lines from the film    I m talking about liquid  Rich enough to have your own jet  Rich enough not to waste time  Fifty  a hundred million dollars  Buddy  A player     lines from the script of Wall Street 78    Wall Street firms have however also contributed to projects such as Habitat for Humanity as well as done food programs in Haiti and trauma centers in Sudan and rescue boats during floods in Bangladesh  79   edit  Wall Street in popular culture Herman Melville s classic short story Bartleby  the Scrivener is subtitled A Story of Wall Street and provides an excellent portrayal of a kind and wealthy lawyer s struggle to reason with that which is unreasonable as he is pushed beyond his comfort zone to  feel  something real for humanity  In William Faulkner s novel The Sound and the Fury  Jason Compson hits on other perceptions of Wall Street  after finding some of his stocks are doing poorly  he blames  the Jews   The film Die Hard with a Vengeance has a plot involving thieves breaking into the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and stealing most of the gold bullion stored underground by driving dump trucks through a nearby Wall Street subway station  Many events of Tom Wolfe s Bonfire of the Vanities center on Wall Street and its culture  On January 26  2000  the band Rage Against The Machine filmed the music video for  Sleep Now in the Fire  on Wall Street  which was directed by Michael Moore  80  The band at one point stormed the Stock Exchange  causing the doors of the Exchange to be closed early  2 52 P M    Trading on the Exchange floor  however  continued uninterrupted  81  not in citation given  The 1987 film Wall Street and its 2010 sequel exemplify many popular conceptions of Wall Street  being a tale of shady corporate dealings and insider trading  82   Wallstreet Kingdom  is a controversial fashion brand promoting capitalism and bonuses on Wall Street  In the film National Treasure a clue to finding the Templar Treasure leads the main characters to Wall Street s Trinity Church  TNA Wrestler Robert Roode is

 Modern Warfare 3  in 2016  soldiers are sent to destroy an invader s radar jamming installation on top of the New York Stock Exchange   edit  Competitors to Wall Street See Financial centre  edit  Transportation Pier 11 Wall Street being historically a commuter destination  much transportation infrastructure has been developed to serve it  Today  Pier 11 at the foot of the street is a busy
