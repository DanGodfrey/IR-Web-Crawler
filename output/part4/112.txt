northern part of the continent  it extends from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west  and northward into the Arctic Ocean  Spanning over 9 9 million square kilometres  Canada is the world s second largest country by total area  and its common border with the United States is the longest land border in the world  The land that is now Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various groups of Aboriginal peoples  Beginning in the late 15th century  British and French expeditions explored  and later settled  along the region s Atlantic coast  France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 after the Seven Years  War  In 1867  with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation  Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces  This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom  This widening autonomy was highlighted by the Balfour Declaration of 1926 and reaffirmed by the Statute of Westminster of 1931  which declared self governing dominions within the British Empire to be equal  The Canada Act of 1982 finally severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the British Parliament  Canada is a federal state that is governed as a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state  It is a bilingual nation with both English and French as official languages at the federal level  One of the world s most highly developed countries  Canada has a diversified economy that is reliant upon its abundant natural resources and upon trade   particularly with the United States  with which Canada has had a long and complex relationship  It is a member of the G7  G8  G20  NATO  OECD  WTO  Commonwealth of Nations  Francophonie  OAS  APEC  and UN  With the sixth highest Human Development Index globally  Canada has one of the highest standards of living and per capita income in

the present day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona  11  Cartier later used the word Canada to refer not only to that particular village  but also the entire area subject to Donnacona  the chief at Stadacona   by 1545  European books and maps had begun referring to this region as Canada  11  In the 17th and early 18th centuries   Canada  referred to the part of New France that lay along the St  Lawrence River and the northern shores of the Great Lakes  The area was later split into two British colonies  Upper Canada and Lower Canada  They were re unified as the Province of Canada in 1841  12  Upon Confederation in 1867  Canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country  and the word Dominion was conferred as the country s title  13  However  as Canada asserted its political autonomy from the United Kingdom  the federal government increasingly used simply Canada on state documents and treaties  a change that was reflected in the renaming of the national holiday from Dominion Day to Canada Day in 1982  14  History Main article  History of Canada See also  List of years in Canada Aboriginal peoples

infectious diseases such as influenza  measles  and smallpox  combined with other effects of European contact  resulted in a forty  to eighty percent population decrease among aboriginal peoples in the centuries after the European arrival  24  Aboriginal peoples in Canada include the First Nations  27 Inuit  28  and M tis  29  The M tis are a mixed blood people who originated in the mid 17th
