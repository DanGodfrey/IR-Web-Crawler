family of the same name  which consists of Homer  Marge  Bart  Lisa and Maggie  The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture  society  television and many aspects of the human condition  The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of animated shorts with the producer James L  Brooks  Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family  substituting Bart for his own name  The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19  1987  After a three season run  the sketch was developed into a half hour prime time show and was an early hit for Fox  becoming the network s first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season  1989 1990   Since its debut on December 17  1989  the show has broadcast 503 episodes and the twenty third season started airing on September 25  2011  The Simpsons is the longest running American sitcom  the longest running American animated

and The Simpsons shorts Groening conceived of the idea for the Simpsons in the lobby of James L  Brooks s office  Brooks had asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts  which Groening initially intended to present as his Life in Hell series  However  when Groening realized that animating Life in Hell would require the rescinding of publication rights for his life s work  he chose another approach and formulated his version of a dysfunctional family  1  He named the characters after his own family members  substituting  Bart  for his own name  adapting an anagram of the word  brat   2  The Simpson family as they first appeared in The Tracey Ullman Show  The Simpson family first appeared as shorts in The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19  1987  3  Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned up in production  However  the animators merely re traced his drawings  which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes  2  One of the earliest jobs of the Klasky Csupo company was creating animated sequences for The Tracey Ullman Show  on which the characters first appeared  4  The animation was produced domestically at Klasky Csupo  5  with Wes Archer  David Silverman  and Bill Kopp being animators for the first season  6  Colorist Gyorgyi Peluce was the person who decided to make the characters yellow  6  In 1989  a team of production companies adapted The Simpsons into a half hour series for the Fox Broadcasting Company  The team included what is now the Klasky Csupo animation house  Jim Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show s content  7  Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he called  the mainstream trash  that they were watching  8  The half hour series premiered on December 17  1989 with  Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire   a Christmas special  9   Some Enchanted Evening  was the first full length episode produced  but it did not broadcast until May 1990  as the last episode of the first season  because of animation problems  10  In 1992  Tracey Ullman filed a lawsuit against Fox  claiming that her show was the source of the series  success  The suit said she should receive a share of the profits of The Simpsons 11  a claim rejected by the courts  12  Executive producers and showrunners List of showrunners throughout the series  run  Season 1 2  Matt Groening  James L  Brooks   amp  Sam Simon Season 3 4  Al Jean  amp  Mike Reiss Season 5 6  David Mirkin Season 7 8  Bill Oakley  amp  Josh Weinstein Season 9 12  Mike Scully Season 13 present  Al Jean Matt Groening and James L  Brooks have served as executive producers during the show s entire history  and also function as creative consultants  Sam Simon  described by former Simpsons director Brad Bird as  the unsung hero  of the show  13  served as creative supervisor for the first four seasons  He was constantly at odds with Groening  Brooks and Gracie Films and left in 1993  14  Before leaving  he negotiated a deal that sees him receive a share of the profits every year  and an executive producer credit despite not having worked on the show since 1993  14  15  A more involved position on the show is the showrunner  who acts as head writer and manages the show s production for an entire season  6  Writing Main article  List of writers of The Simpsons Al Jean  left  is the current executive producer of the show and David Mirkin  right  is a former executive producer and has been a part of the writing staff since 1994  The first team of writers  assembled by Sam Simon  consisted of John Swartzwelder  Jon Vitti  George Meyer  Jeff Martin  Al Jean  Mike Reiss  Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky  16  Newer Simpsons  writing teams typically consist of sixteen writers who propose episode ideas at the beginning of each December  17  The main writer of each episode writes the first draft  Group rewriting sessions develop final scripts by adding or removing jokes  inserting scenes  and calling for re readings of lines by the show s vocal performers  18  Until 2004  19  George Meyer  who had developed the show since the first season  was active in these sessions  According to long time writer Jon Vitti  Meyer usually invented the best lines in a given episode  even though other writers may receive script credits  18  Each episode takes six months to produce so the show rarely comments on current events  20  Part

Swartzwelder is the most prolific writer on The Simpsons  staff  21  One of the best known former writers is Conan O Brien  who contributed to several episodes in the early 1990s before replacing David Letterman as host of the talk show Late Night  22  English comedian Ricky Gervais wrote the episode  Homer Simpson  This Is Your Wife   becoming the first celebrity to both write and guest star in an episode  23 Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg  writers of the film Superbad  wrote the episode  Homer the Whopper   with Rogen voicing a character in it  24  At the end of 2007 the writers of The Simpsons went on strike together with the rest of the Writers Guild of America  East  The show s writers had joined the guild in 1998  25  Voice actors Main articles  List of cast members of The Simpsons  List of guest stars on The Simpsons  and Non English versions of The Simpsons The Simpsons has six main cast members  Dan Castellaneta  Julie Kavner  Nancy Cartwright  Yeardley Smith  Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer  Castellaneta performs Homer Simpson  Grampa Simpson  Krusty the Clown  Barney Gumble and other adult  male characters  26 Julie Kavner speaks the voices of Marge Simpson and Patty and Selma  as well as several minor characters  26  Castellaneta and Kavner had been a part of The Tracey Ullman Show cast and were given the parts so that new actors would not be needed  27  Cartwright performs the voices of Bart Simpson  Nelson Muntz  Ralph Wiggum and other children  26  Smith  the voice of Lisa Simpson  is the only cast member who regularly voices only one character  although she occasionally plays other episodic characters  26  The producers decided to hold casting for the roles of Bart and Lisa  Smith had initially been asked to audition for the role of Bart  but casting director Bonita Pietila believed her voice was too high  28  so she was given the role of Lisa instead  29  Cartwright was originally brought in to voice Lisa  but upon arriving at the audition  she found that Lisa was simply described as the  middle child  and at the time did not have much personality  Cartwright became more interested in the role of Bart  who was described as  devious  underachieving  school hating  irreverent   and  clever   30  Groening let her try out for the part instead  and upon hearing her read  gave her the job on the spot  31  Cartwright is the only one of the six main Simpsons cast members who had been professionally trained in voice acting prior to working on the show  32  Azaria and Shearer do not voice members of the title family  but play a majority of the male townspeople  Azaria  who has been a part of the Simpsons regular voice cast since the second season  33  voices recurring characters such as Moe Szyslak  Chief Wiggum  Apu Nahasapeemapetilon and Professor Frink  Shearer provides voices for Mr  Burns  Waylon Smithers  Principal Skinner  Ned Flanders  Reverend Lovejoy and Dr  Hibbert  26  With the exception of Shearer  every main cast member has won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice Over Performance  34  However  Shearer was nominated for the award in 2009  35  With one exception  episode credits list only the voice actors  and not the characters they voice  Both Fox and the production crew wanted to keep their identities secret during the early seasons and  therefore  closed most of the recording sessions while refusing to publish photos of the recording artists  36  However  the network eventually revealed which roles each actor performed in the episode  Old Money   because the producers said the voice actors should receive credit for their work  37  In 2003  the cast appeared in an episode of Inside the Actors Studio  doing live performances of their characters  voices  Until 1998  the six main actors were paid  30 000 per episode  In 1998 they were involved in a pay dispute with Fox  The company threatened to replace them with new actors  even going as far as preparing for casting of new voices  but series creator Groening supported the actors in their action  38  The issue was soon resolved and  from 1998 to 2004  they were paid  125 000 per episode  The show s revenue continued to rise through syndication and DVD sales  and in April 2004 the main cast stopped appearing for script readings  demanding they be paid  360 000 per episode  39  40  The strike was resolved a month later 41  and their salaries were increased to something between  250 000 42  and  360 000 per episode  43  In 2008  production for the twentieth season was put on hold due to new contract negotiations with the voice actors  who wanted a  healthy bump  in salary to an amount close to  500 000 per episode  43  The negotiations were soon completed  and the actors  salary was raised to  400 000 per episode  44  Main cast members Dan Castellaneta Julie Kavner Nancy Cartwright Yeardley Smith Hank Azaria Harry Shearer Homer  Grampa  Barney  Krusty  Groundskeeper Willie  Mayor Quimby  Hans Moleman and others Marge  Patty and Selma Bart  Nelson  Ralph  Todd Flanders  and others Lisa Moe  Chief Wiggum  Apu  Comic Book Guy  Carl  Cletus  Professor Frink  Dr  Nick and others Mr  Burns  Smithers  Ned Flanders  Rev  Lovejoy  Kent Brockman  Dr  Hibbert  Lenny  Principal Skinner  Otto  Rainier Wolfcastle and others  In addition to the main cast  Pamela Hayden  Tress MacNeille  Marcia Wallace  Maggie Roswell  and Russi Taylor voice supporting characters  26  From 1999 to 2002  Roswell s characters were voiced by Marcia Mitzman Gaven  Karl Wiedergott has also appeared in minor roles  but does not voice any recurring characters  45  Repeat  special guest  cast members include Albert Brooks  Phil Hartman  Jon Lovitz  Joe Mantegna  and Kelsey Grammer  46  Following Hartman s death in 1998  the characters he voiced were retired  1  Episodes will quite often feature guest voices from a wide range of professions  including actors  athletes  authors  bands  musicians and scientists  In the earlier seasons  most of the guest stars voiced characters  but eventually more started appearing as themselves  Tony Bennett was the first guest star to appear as himself  appearing briefly in the season two episode  Dancin  Homer   47 The Simpsons holds the world record for  Most Guest Stars Featured in a Television Series   48  The show has been dubbed into several other languages  including Japanese  German  Spanish  and Portuguese  It is also one of the few programs dubbed in both French and Quebec French  49 The Simpsons has been broadcast in Arabic  but due to Islamic customs  numerous aspects of the show have been changed  For example  Homer drinks soda instead of beer and eats Egyptian beef sausages instead of hot dogs  Because of such changes  the Arabized version of the series met with a negative reaction from the life long Simpsons fans in the area  50  Animation Animation director David Silverman  who helped define the look of the show  6  Several different U S  and international studios animate The Simpsons  Throughout the run of the animated shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show  the animation was produced domestically at Klasky Csupo  5  With the debut of the series  because of an increased workload  Fox subcontracted production to several international studios  located in South Korea  5  These are AKOM  51 Anivision  52 Rough Draft Studios  53 USAnimation  54  and Toonzone Entertainment  55  A subcontractor connection to the North Korean SEK studio has been suspected but not confirmed  56  Artists at the U S  animation studio  Film Roman  draw storyboards  design new characters  backgrounds  props and draw character and background layouts  which in turn become animatics to be screened for the writers at Gracie Films for any changes to be made before the work is shipped overseas  The overseas studios then draw the inbetweens  ink and paint  and render the animation to tape before it is shipped back to the United States to be delivered to Fox three to four months later  57  For the first three seasons  Klasky Csupo animated The Simpsons in the United States  In 1992  the show s production company  Gracie Films  switched domestic production to Film Roman  58  who continue to animate the show as of 2010  In Season 14  production switched from traditional cel animation to digital ink and paint  59  The first episode to experiment with digital coloring was  Radioactive Man  in 1995  Animators used digital ink and paint during production of the Season 12 episode  Tennis the Menace   but Gracie Films delayed the regular use of digital ink and paint until two seasons later  The already completed  Tennis the Menace  was broadcast as made  60  The series began high definition production in Season 20  the first episode   Take My Life  Please   aired February 15  2009  The move to HDTV included a new opening sequence  61  Matt Groening called it a complicated change because it affected the timing and composition of animation  62  Characters Main article  List of characters in The Simpsons The Simpsons sports a vast array of secondary and tertiary characters  The Simpsons are a typical family who live in a fictional  Middle American  town of Springfield  63  Homer  the father  works as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant  a position at odds with his careless  buffoonish personality  He is married to Marge Simpson  a stereotypical American housewife and mother  They have three children  Bart  a ten year old troublemaker  Lisa  a precocious eight year old activist  and Maggie  the baby of the family who rarely speaks  but communicates by sucking on a pacifier  The family owns a dog  Santa s Little Helper  and a cat  Snowball V  renamed Snowball II in  I   Annoyed Grunt  Bot   64  Both pets have had starring roles in several episodes  Despite the passing of yearly milestones such as holidays or birthdays  the Simpsons do not physically age and still appear just as they did at the end of the 1980s  Although the family is dysfunctional  many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another  65  The show includes an array of quirky characters  co workers  teachers  family friends  extended relatives  townspeople and local celebrities  The creators originally intended many of these characters as one time jokesters or for fulfilling needed functions in the town  A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes  According to Matt Groening  the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the comedy show SCTV  66  Setting Main articles  Springfield  The Simpsons  and List of locations in The Simpsons The Simpsons takes place in the fictional American town of Springfield in an unknown and impossible to determine U S  state  The show is intentionally evasive in regard to Springfield s location  67  The name  Springfield  is a common one in America and appears in 22 states  68  Springfield s geography  and that of its surroundings  contains coastlines  deserts  vast farmland  tall mountains  or whatever the story or joke requires  69  Groening has said that Springfield has much in common with Portland  Oregon  the city where he grew up  70  Themes Main articles  Media in The Simpsons  Politics in The Simpsons  and Religion in The Simpsons The Simpsons uses the standard setup of a situational comedy  or sitcom  as its premise  The series centers on a family and their life in a typical American town  63  serving as a satirical parody of a working class American lifestyle  71  However  because of its animated nature  The Simpsons  scope is larger than that of a regular sitcom  The town of Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society  By having Homer work in a nuclear power plant  the show can comment on the state of the environment  72  Through Bart and Lisa s days at Springfield Elementary School  the show s writers illustrate pressing or controversial issues in the field of education  The town features a vast array of media channels from kids  television programming to local news  which enables the producers to make jokes about themselves and the entertainment industry  73  Some commentators say the show is political in nature and susceptible to a left wing bias  74 Al Jean admitted in an interview that  We  the show  are of liberal bent   75  The writers often evince an appreciation for liberal ideals  but the show makes jokes across the political spectrum  76  The show portrays government and large corporations as callous entities that take advantage of the common worker  75  Thus  the writers often portray authority figures in an unflattering or negative light  In The Simpsons  politicians are corrupt  ministers such as Reverend Lovejoy are indifferent to churchgoers  and the local police force is incompetent  77  Religion also figures as a recurring theme  In times of crisis  the family often turns to God  and the show has dealt with most of the major religions  78  Hallmarks Opening sequence Main article  The Simpsons opening sequence The Simpsons  opening sequence is one of the show s most memorable hallmarks  Most episodes open with the camera zooming through the show s title towards the town of Springfield  The camera then follows the members of the family on their way home  Upon entering their house  the Simpsons settle down on their couch to watch television  The opening was created by David Silverman  the first task he did when production began on the show  79  The series  distinctive theme song was composed by musician Danny Elfman in 1989  after Groening approached him requesting a retro style piece  This piece has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career  80  One of the most distinctive aspects of the opening is that three of the segments change from episode to episode  Bart writes different things on the school chalkboard  79  Lisa plays different solos on her saxophone  and different gags accompany the family as they enter their living room to sit on the couch  81  On February 15  2009  a new opening credit sequence was introduced to accompany the switch to HDTV  The sequence had all of the features of the original opening  but added numerous details and characters  82  Halloween episodes Bart introducing a segment of  Treehouse of Horror IV  in the manner of Rod Serling s Night Gallery  Main article  Treehouse of Horror  series  The special Halloween episode has become an annual tradition   Treehouse of Horror  first broadcast in 1990 as part of season two and established the pattern of three separate  self contained stories in each Halloween episode  83  These pieces usually involve the family in some horror  science fiction  or supernatural setting and often parody or pay homage to a famous piece of work in those genres  84  They always take place outside the normal continuity of the show  Although the Treehouse series is meant to be seen on Halloween  in recent years  new installments have premiered after Halloween due to Fox s current contract with Major League Baseball s World Series  85  Humor The show s humor turns on cultural references that cover a wide spectrum of society so that viewers from all generations can enjoy the show  86  Such references  for example  come from movies  television  music  literature  science  and history  86  The animators also regularly add jokes or sight gags into the show s background via humorous or incongruous bits of text in signs  newspapers  and elsewhere  87  The audience may often not notice the visual jokes in a single viewing  Some are so fleeting that they become apparent only by pausing a video recording of the show  87  Kristin Thompson argues that The Simpsons uses a     flurry of cultural references  intentionally inconsistent characterization  and considerable self reflexivity about television conventions and the status of the programme as a television show   88  One of Bart s early hallmarks were his prank calls to Moe s Tavern owner Moe Szyslak in which Bart calls Moe and asks for a gag name  Moe tries to find that person in the bar  but soon realizes it is a prank call and angrily threatens Bart  These calls were based on a series of prank calls known as the Tube Bar recordings  Moe was based partly on Tube Bar owner Louis  Red  Deutsch  whose often profane responses inspired Moe s violent side  89  As the series progressed  it became more difficult for the writers to come up with a fake name and to write Moe s angry response  and the pranks were dropped as a regular joke during the fourth season  90  91 The Simpsons also often includes self referential humor  92  The most common form is jokes about Fox Broadcasting  93  For example  the episode  She Used to Be My Girl  included a scene where a Fox News van drove down the street while displaying a large  Bush Cheney 2004  banner and playing Queen s  We Are the Champions   in reference to the 2004 presidential election  94  95  The show uses catchphrases  and most of the primary and secondary characters have at least one each  96  Notable expressions include Homer s annoyed grunt  D oh    Mr  Burns   Excellent     and Nelson Muntz s  Ha ha    Some of Bart s catchphrases  such as   Ay  caramba     Don t have a cow  man   and  Eat my shorts   appeared on t shirts in the show s early days  97  However  Bart rarely used the latter two phrases until after they became popular through the merchandising  The use of many of these catchphrases has declined in recent seasons  The episode  Bart Gets Famous  mocks catchphrase based humor  as Bart achieves fame on the Krusty the Clown Show solely for saying  I didn t do it   98  Influences on culture Idioms A number of neologisms that originated on The Simpsons have entered popular vernacular  99  100 Mark Liberman  director of the Linguistic Data Consortium  remarked   The Simpsons has apparently taken over from Shakespeare and the Bible as our culture s greatest source of idioms  catchphrases and sundry other textual allusions   100  The most famous catchphrase is Homer s annoyed grunt   D oh   So ubiquitous is the expression that it is now listed in the Oxford English Dictionary  but without the apostrophe  101  Dan Castellaneta says he borrowed the phrase from James Finlayson  an actor in early Laurel and Hardy comedies  who pronounced it in a more elongated and whining tone  The staff of The Simpsons told Castellaneta to shorten the noise  and it went on to become the well known exclamation in the television series  102  Groundskeeper Willie s description of the French as  cheese eating surrender monkeys  was used by National Review columnist Jonah Goldberg in 2003  after France s opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq  The phrase quickly spread to other journalists  100  103   Cromulent  and  Embiggen   words used in  Lisa the Iconoclast   have since appeared in the Dictionary com s 21st Century Lexicon  104  and scientific journals respectively  100  105   Kwyjibo   a fake Scrabble word invented by Bart in  Bart the Genius   was used as one of the aliases of the creator of the Melissa worm  106   I  for one  welcome our new insect overlords   was used by Kent Brockman in  Deep Space Homer  and has become a common variety of phrase  107  Variants of Brockman s utterance are used to express mock submission  usually for the purpose of humor  108  It has been used in media  such as New Scientist magazine  109  The dismissive term  Meh   believed to have been popularized by the show  100  110  111  entered the Collins English Dictionary in 2008  112  Other words credited as stemming from the show include  yoink  and  craptacular   100  The Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations includes several quotations from the show  As well as  cheese eating surrender monkeys   Homer s lines   Kids  you tried your best and you failed miserably  The lesson is never try   from  Burns  Heir   season five  1994  as well as  Kids are the best  Apu  You can teach them to hate the things you hate  And they practically raise themselves  what with the Internet and all   from  Eight Misbehavin    season 11  1999   entered the dictionary in August 2007  113  Television The Simpsons was the first successful animated program in American prime time since Wait Till Your Father Gets Home in the 1970s  114  During most of the 1980s  US pundits considered animated shows as appropriate only for children  and animating a show was too expensive to achieve a quality suitable for prime time television  The Simpsons changed this perception  5  The use of Korean animation studios for tweening  coloring  and filming made the episodes cheaper  The success of The Simpsons and the lower production cost prompted US television networks to take chances on other animated series  5  This development led US producers to a 1990s boom in new  animated prime time shows  such as South Park  Family Guy  King of the Hill  Futurama  and The Critic  5   The Simpsons created an audience for prime time animation that had not been there for many  many years   said Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane   As far as I m concerned  they basically re invented the wheel  They created what is in many ways you could classify it as a wholly new medium   115 South Park later paid homage to The Simpsons with the episode  Simpsons Already Did It   116  In Georgia  the animated television sitcom The Samsonadzes  launched in November 2009  has been noted for its very strong resemblance with The Simpsons  which its creator Shalva Ramishvili has acknowledged  117  118  119  The Simpsons has also influenced live action shows like Malcolm in the Middle  which featured the use of sight gags and did not use a laugh track unlike most sitcoms  120  121 Malcolm in the Middle debuted January 9  2000 in the time slot after The Simpsons  Ricky Gervais has called The Simpsons a major influence on his British comedy The Office  which also dispenses with a laugh track  122  Fellow British sitcom Spaced was  according to its director Edgar Wright   an attempt to do a live action The Simpsons   123  Reception  legacy and achievements Early success The Simpsons was the Fox network s first television series to rank among a season s top 30 highest rated shows  124  While later seasons would focus on Homer  Bart was the lead character in most of the first three seasons  In 1990  Bart quickly became one of the most popular characters on television in what was termed  Bartmania   125  126  127  128  He became the most prevalent Simpsons character on memorabilia  such as T shirts  In the early 1990s  millions of T shirts featuring Bart were sold  129  as many as one million were sold on some days  130  Believing Bart to be a bad role model  several American public schools banned T shirts featuring Bart next to captions such as  I m Bart Simpson  Who the hell are you   and  Underachiever   And proud of it  man      131  132  133 The Simpsons merchandise sold well and generated  2 billion in revenue during the first 14 months of sales  131  Because of his popularity  Bart was often the most promoted member of the Simpson family in advertisements for the show  even for episodes in which he was not involved in the main plot  134  Due to the show s success  over the summer of 1990 the Fox Network decided to switch The Simpsons  time slot so that it would move from 8 00 p m  ET on Sunday night to the same time on Thursday  where it would compete with The Cosby Show on NBC  the number one show at the time  135  136  Through the summer  several news outlets published stories about the supposed  Bill vs  Bart  rivalry  130  135   Bart Gets an F   season two  1990  was the first episode to air against The Cosby Show  and it received a lower Nielsen ratings  tying for eighth behind The Cosby Show  which had an 18 5 rating  The rating is based on the number of household televisions that were tuned into the show  but Nielsen Media Research estimated that 33 6 million viewers watched the episode  making it the number one show in terms of actual viewers that week  At the time  it was the most watched episode in the history of the Fox Network  137  and it is still the highest rated episode in the history of The Simpsons  138  The Simpsons has been praised by many critics  being described as  the most irreverent and unapologetic show on the air   139  In a 1990 review of the show  Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described it as  the American family at its most complicated  drawn as simple cartoons  It s this neat paradox that makes millions of people turn away from the three big networks on Sunday nights to concentrate on The Simpsons   140  Tucker would also describe the show as a  pop cultural phenomenon  a prime time cartoon show that appeals to the entire family   141  Run length achievements On February 9  1997  The Simpsons surpassed The Flintstones with the episode  The Itchy  amp  Scratchy  amp  Poochie Show  as the longest running prime time animated series in the United States  142  In 2004  The Simpsons replaced The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet  1952 to 1966  as the longest running sitcom  animated or live action  in the United States  143  In 2009  The Simpsons surpassed The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet s record of 435 episodes and is now recognized by Guinness World Records as the world s longest running sitcom  in terms of episode count   144  145  In October 2004  Scooby Doo briefly overtook The Simpsons as the American animated show with the highest number of episodes  146  However  network executives in April 2005 again cancelled Scooby Doo  which finished with 371 episodes  and The Simpsons reclaimed the title with 378 episodes at the end of their seventeenth season  147  In May 2007  The Simpsons reached their 400th episode at the end of the eighteenth season  While The Simpsons has the record for the number of episodes by an American animated show  other animated series have surpassed The Simpsons  148  For example  the Japanese anime series Sazae san has over 3 000 episodes to its credit  148  In 2009  Fox began a year long celebration of the show titled  Best  20 Years  Ever   to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the premiere of The Simpsons  One of the first parts of the celebration is the  Unleash Your Yellow  contest in which entrants must design a poster for the show  149  The celebration ended on January 10  2010  almost twenty years after  Bart the Genius  aired on January 14  1990  with The Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special   In 3 D  On Ice   a documentary special by documentary filmmaker Morgan Spurlock that examines the  cultural phenomenon of The Simpsons   150  151  As of the twenty first season  2009 2010   The Simpsons became the longest running American primetime  scripted television series  having surpassed Gunsmoke  However  Gunsmoke s episode count of 635 episodes far surpasses The Simpsons  which would not reach that mark until its approximate 29th season  under normal programming schedules  143  152  In October 2011  Fox announced that The Simpsons had been renewed for a 24th and 25th season  which means the show will reach 559 episodes  153  154  Awards Main article  List of awards and nominations received by The Simpsons The Simpsons have been awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame  The Simpsons has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series  including 27 Primetime Emmy Awards  48  30 Annie Awards 155  and a Peabody Award  156  In a 1999 issue celebrating the 20th century s greatest achievements in arts and entertainment  Time magazine named The Simpsons the century s best television series  157  In that same issue  Time included Bart Simpson in the Time 100  the publication s list of the century s 100 most influential people  158  Bart was the only fictional character on the list  On January 14  2000  the Simpsons were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame  159  Also in 2000  Entertainment Weekly magazine TV critic Ken Tucker named The Simpsons the greatest television show of the 1990s  Furthermore  viewers of the UK television channel Channel 4 have voted The Simpsons at the top of two polls  2001 s 100 Greatest Kids  TV shows  160  and 2005 s The 100 Greatest Cartoons  161  with Homer Simpson voted into first place in 2001 s 100 Greatest TV Characters  162  Homer would also place ninth on Entertainment Weekly s list of the  50 Greatest TV icons   163  In 2002  The Simpsons ranked  8 on TV Guide s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time  164  and in 2007 it was included in TIME s list of the  100 Best TV Shows of All Time   165  In 2008 the show was placed in first on Entertainment Weekly s  Top 100 Shows of the Past 25 Years   166 Empire named it the greatest TV show of all time  167  In 2010  Entertainment Weekly named Homer  the greatest character of the last 20 years   168  Criticism and controversy Bart s rebellious nature  which frequently resulted in no punishment for his misbehavior  led some parents and conservatives to characterize him as a poor role model for children  169  170  In schools  educators claimed that Bart was a  threat to learning  because of his  underachiever and proud of it  attitude and negative attitude regarding his education  171  Others described him as  egotistical  aggressive and mean spirited   172  In a 1991 interview  Bill Cosby described Bart as a bad role model for children  calling him  angry  confused  frustrated   In response  Matt Groening said   That sums up Bart  all right  Most people are in a struggle to be normal he thinks normal is very boring  and does things that others just wished they dare do   173  On January 27  1992  then President George H  W  Bush said   We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family  to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons   131  The writers rushed out a tongue in cheek reply in the form of a short segment which aired three days later before a rerun of  Stark Raving Dad  in which Bart replied   Hey  we re just like the Waltons  We re praying for an end to the Depression  too   174  175  Various episodes of the show have generated controversy  The Simpsons visit Australia in  Bart vs  Australia   season six  1995  and Brazil in  Blame It on Lisa   season 13  2002  and both episodes generated controversy and negative reaction in the visited countries  176  In the latter case  Rio de Janeiro s tourist board   who claimed that the city was portrayed as having rampant street crime  kidnappings  slums  and monkey and rat infestations   went so far as to threaten Fox with legal action  177  Groening was a fierce and vocal critic of the episode  A Star Is Burns   season six  1995  which featured a crossover with The Critic  He felt that it was just an advertisement for The Critic  and that people would incorrectly associate the show with him  When he was unsuccessful in getting the episode pulled  he had his name removed from the credits and went public with his concerns  openly criticizing James L  Brooks and saying the episode  violates the Simpsons  universe   In response  Brooks said  I am furious with Matt        he s allowed his opinion  but airing this publicly in the press is going too far        his behavior right now is rotten   178  179   The Principal and the Pauper   season nine  1997  is one of the most controversial episodes of The Simpsons  Many fans and critics reacted negatively to the revelation that Seymour Skinner  a recurring character since the first season  was an impostor  The episode has been criticized by Groening and by Harry Shearer  who provides the voice of Skinner  In a 2001 interview  Shearer recalled that after reading the script  he told the writers   That s so wrong  You re taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed it in the trash can for no good reason  for a story we ve done before with other characters  It s so arbitrary and gratuitous  and it s disrespectful to the audience   180  The show has reportedly been taken off the air in several countries  China banned it from prime time television in August 2006   in an effort to protect China s struggling animation studios   181  In 2008  Venezuela barred the show from airing on morning television as it was  unsuitable for children   182  The same year  several Russian Pentecostal churches demanded The Simpsons  South Park and some other Western cartoons to be put off air  for propaganda of various vices  and the broadcaster s license to be revoked  However  the court decision later dismissed this request  183  Criticism of declining quality Critics  reviews of early Simpsons episodes praised the show for its wit  realism  and intelligence  8  184  In the late 1990s  around the airing of season ten  the tone and emphasis of the show began to change  Some critics started calling the show  tired   185  By 2000  some long term fans had become disillusioned with the show and pointed to its shift from character driven plots to what they perceived as an overemphasis on zany antics  186  187  188  The BBC noted  the common consensus is that The Simpsons  golden era ended after season nine   189  while Todd Leopold of CNN  in an article looking at its perceived decline  stated  for many fans       the glory days are long past   188  Jim Schembri of the Sydney Morning Herald called the show  a cultural touchstone for at least two possibly three generations of couch potatoes   but claimed that the show has declined in quality  He attributed this to an abandonment of character driven storylines in favour of and overuse of celebrity cameo appearances and references to popular culture  Schembri wrote   The central tragedy of The Simpsons is that it has gone from commanding attention to merely being attention seeking  It began by proving that cartoon characters don t have to be caricatures  they can be invested with real emotions  Now the show has in essence fermented into a limp parody of itself  Memorable story arcs have been sacrificed for the sake of celebrity walk ons and punchline hungry dialogue   190  Author Douglas Coupland described claims of declining quality in the series as  hogwash   saying  The Simpsons hasn t fumbled the ball in fourteen years  it s hardly likely to fumble it now   191 Mike Scully  who was showrunner during seasons nine through twelve  has been the subject of criticism  192  193  Chris Suellentrop of Slate wrote that  under Scully s tenure  The Simpsons became  well  a cartoon        Episodes that once would have ended with Homer and Marge bicycling into the sunset now end with Homer blowing a tranquilizer dart into Marge s neck  The show s still funny  but it hasn t been touching in years   192  When asked in 2007 how the series  longevity is sustained  Scully joked   Lower your quality standards  Once you ve done that you can go on forever   194  In 2003  to celebrate the show s 300th episode  Barting Over   USA Today published a pair of Simpsons related articles  a top ten episodes list chosen by the webmaster of The Simpsons Archive fansite  195  and a top 15 list by The Simpsons  own writers  196  The most recent episode listed on the fan list was 1997 s  Homer s Phobia   the Simpsons  writers most recent choice was 2000 s  Behind the Laughter   In 2004  Harry Shearer criticized what he perceived as the show s declining quality   I rate the last three seasons as among the worst  so Season Four looks very good to me now   197  In response  Dan Castellaneta stated  I don t agree        I think Harry s issue is that the show isn t as grounded as it was in the first three or four seasons  that it s gotten crazy or a little more madcap  I think it organically changes to stay fresh   198  Despite the criticism  The Simpsons manages to maintain a large viewership and attract new fans  While the first season enjoyed an average of 13 4 million viewers per episode in the U S   124  the twenty first season had an average of 7 2 million viewers  199  In an April 2006 interview  Matt Groening said   I honestly don t see any end in sight  I think it s possible that the show will become too financially cumbersome    but right now  the show is creatively  I think  as good or better than it s ever been  The animation is incredibly detailed and imaginative  and the stories do things that we haven t done before  So creatively there s no reason to quit   200  Other media Main article  The Simpsons  franchise  Comic books Numerous Simpson related comic books have been released over the years  So far  nine comic book series
