developed for the 2006 07 television season  was substantially different from its current form  The only characters from the initial pilot that were kept for the reshot pilot for the series were Leonard and Sheldon  portrayed by Johnny Galecki and Jim Parsons respectively and named for comedy great Sheldon Leonard citation needed    The cast was rounded off by two female leads  Canadian actress Amanda Walsh as Katie   a street hardened  tough as nails  woman with a vulnerable interior  who the boys meet after she breaks up with her boyfriend and invite to live in their apartment  Katie was effectively replaced by Penny in the second pilot   13  14  and Iris Bahr as Gilda  a scientist colleague and friend of the boys who was threatened by Katie s presence  The initial pilot used Thomas Dolby s hit  She Blinded Me With Science  as theme music  The series was not picked up  but the creators were given an opportunity to retool the show and produce a second pilot  They brought in the remaining cast and retooled the show to its final format  The original unaired pilot has never been officially released  but it has circulated on the Internet  On the evolution of the show  Lorre said  We did the  Big Bang Pilot  about two and a half years ago  and it sucked    but there were two remarkable things that worked perfectly  and that was Johnny and Jim  We rewrote the thing entirely  and then we were blessed with Kaley and Simon and Kunal   As to whether the world will ever see that original pilot  maybe on a DVD  Lorre said  Wow that would be something  we will see  Show your failures     15  The title card for the original 2006 pilot The first and second pilots of The Big Bang Theory were directed by James Burrows  who did not continue with the show  The

there s actual progress to the boards     We worked hard to get all the science right   5  Several of the actors in The Big Bang Theory worked together previously on Roseanne including Johnny Galecki

rejected in favor of another artist s  Robertson agreed to write a theme only after learning that he was the sole writer that Lorre and Prady had asked  He drew inspiration from Simon Singh s book

talk page   February 2011   edit  Science Much of the show focuses on science  particularly physics  The four main male characters are employed at Caltech and have science related occupations  The characters frequently banter about scientific theories or news  notably around the start of the show   and make science related jokes  Science has also interfered with the characters  romantic lives  Leslie broke up with Leonard when he sided with Sheldon in his support for string theory rather than her support for loop quantum gravity  When Leonard joined Sheldon  Raj and Howard on a three month Arctic research trip  it separated Leonard and Penny at a time their relationship was budding  When Bernadette took an interest in Leonard s work  it made both Penny and Howard jealous and resulted in Howard confronting Leonard  and Penny asking Sheldon to teach her physics  Sheldon and Amy also briefly ended their relationship after an argument over which of their fields was superior to the other

book store night   the store in question being run by fellow geek and recurring character Stuart  On a number of occasions  the group members have dressed up as pop culture characters  including The Flash  Aquaman  Frodo Baggins  Superman  Batman  Spock  the Doctor  Green Lantern  and Thor  albeit as the original Norse god and not the Marvel Comics character   As a consequence of losing a bet to

depicting the Batman  Superman  Flash  Greatest American Hero  or Green Lantern logos  The group are also fans of the Indiana Jones series  even willing to spend several hours in line outside of a theater to watch a special screening of the film with 21 seconds of new footage   edit  Leonard and Penny s relationship One of the recurring themes is the relationship between Leonard and Penny  Leonard becomes attracted to Penny within seconds of seeing her in the pilot episode  The season frequently featured Leonard s attraction to Penny as a basis for humor  Leonard and Penny briefly date at the start of the second season  however  Penny quickly breaks up with Leonard because she is afraid that her educational attainments aren t good enough for Leonard and that he may become bored  The two date other people throughout the second season  but clearly still have feelings for each other  When Leonard returns from a 3 month expedition to the North Pole in the season 3 premiere  they commence a relationship which lasts for most of the season until Leonard tells Penny that he loves her and she realizes she cannot say it back  and she reluctantly breaks up with him  Again  both Leonard and Penny go on to date other people  most notably with Leonard dating Raj s sister Priya for much of season 4  Penny has shown regret towards her decision to break up with Leonard by admitting to her girlfriends that she misses Leonard  She also exhibits jealousy towards Priya  especially after Priya demanded Leonard stay away from her  After dating Leonard  Penny also has negative reactions to her male dates who are not very intelligent  Eventually  as the episodes roll on  Leonard became more and more interested in Priya  However she seemed to become less and less interested in Leonard as they went on dating  Later in the season  Leonard is over at Raj s apartment with Priya  making out with her  when Priya s parents call from India  Leonard is told to leave the room as Priya answers the call  Unknowing of Leonard s presence or his secret relationship with Priya  her parents state that they will be so happy when Priya moves back to India  Leonard comes in  shouting out that he is shocked she is moving back to India  and assumes it means he and Priya are breaking up  Leonard goes home to his apartment  where Raj has been sleeping because of Leonard staying at Raj s apartment  Penny and Raj  while enjoying a friendly evening  got drunk and ended up in bed together  however  nothing happened physically between them  Leonard finds out when they emerge and assumes the worst  it is only later he learns the truth   nothing happened  In season five  Leonard resumes his relationship with Priya online  It seems to work for Leonard  but he is conflicted when he meets Alice  a girl who is really into him  at the comic book store  Leonard decides he must be faithful to Priya  ending things with Alice  Leonard confesses to Priya about going out with Alice  only to discover that Priya has slept with an ex boyfriend  and they break up  Penny is still single and dating  though when drunk has confessed that she regrets breaking up with Leonard  In  The Ornithophobia Diffusion  Leonard and Penny go to the movies as friends  Leonard decides that since they are no longer dating he can be honest and does not have to pay for everything or do whatever Penny wants to make Penny like him and have sex with him  The two bicker all evening and sabotage each other s attempts to chat up people in the bar  Penny decides that she likes the new more assertive Leonard  Leonard sees this as another opportunity to grovel and try to get Penny to sleep with him  so she leaves  On the spur of the moment in  The Recombination Hypothesis   Leonard asks Penny out on a date after he imagined what getting back with her might be like  Their real date ends successfully  and they agree to try to renew their relationship slowly in  The Beta Test Initiation    edit  Sheldon and Amy s relationship A new recurring theme is the status of Sheldon and Amy Farrah Fowler  Ph D   a neurobiologist whom Raj and Howard found as a possible match for Sheldon through an internet dating service  without Sheldon s knowledge   By Sheldon s own admission  she is most like him by any standard  Like him  she has previously avoided relationships  whether romantic or otherwise is unclear   and only participated in the online dating herself to fulfill an agreement with her mother that she date at least once a year  in exchange  her mother does not discuss Amy s lack of a love life  plus she gains use of her mother s George Foreman Grill   During the four months of their relationship  taking place off screen between seasons 3 and 4   they communicated on a daily basis via text messages  email and Twitter  but never saw each other in person  Sheldon  however  did not consider Amy his girlfriend  Penny later suggests that they should go on a date and ends up driving them  having dinner with them in  The Robotic Manipulation   Penny occasionally refers to Sheldon and Amy collectively as  Shamy   In the episode  The Agreement Dissection   Amy  Penny  and Bernadette decide to take Sheldon dancing  Sheldon dances only with Amy  which he does not mind  He later follows Amy back to her apartment  They talk for a few minutes before she kisses him on the lips  Instead of getting annoyed  Sheldon just says  Fascinating   In  The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition   after Amy agrees to go on a date with Stuart the comic book store owner  Sheldon asks Amy to be his girlfriend with no other change to their current relationship  Soon after  he draws up  The Relationship Agreement  to verify the ground rules of him as her boyfriend and her as his girlfriend  similar to his  Roommate Agreement  with Leonard   Amy agrees but later regrets not having a lawyer read through it  After Penny and Bernandette go wedding shopping without Amy in  The Isolation Permutation   Sheldon comforts a depressed Amy by cuddling with her on her couch  however  Amy first suggests that they have sex   edit  Religion Religion plays a minor role in the series  Sheldon was raised in a fundamentalist Christian household  He refers to his childhood as  hell   and a recurrent theme is his conflict with his devout mother  Mary  whose creationist beliefs often clash with Sheldon s understanding of evolution  In  The Lunar Excitation   Sheldon mentions his promise to Mary to attend church once a year  In  The Wheaton Recurrence   after scoring a spare in bowling  Sheldon happily exclaims  Thank you  Jesus     as my mother would say   In the episode  The Zarnecki Incursion   Sheldon can be heard exclaiming  Why hast thou forsaken me  o deity whose existence I doubt   Howard and Raj are Jewish and Hindu  respectively  and semi observant  apparently defying many religious customs without worry  They frequently flout dietary prohibitions and tend to give each other grief about them  Raj quotes from the Talmud after Howard eats pork  and Howard sharply says he holds his tongue when Raj eats a Big Mac  Still  Raj mentions reincarnation and karma  and Howard celebrates at least some Jewish holidays and refuses to get tattoos so he  can be buried in a Jewish cemetery   Howard s mother is a caricature of an over protective Jewish mother  Neither Leonard s nor Penny s religious convictions are made clear  Leonard approaches Christian festivals with less skepticism than Sheldon  Penny has expressed belief in ghosts  astrology  psychics and voodoo  Bernadette is Catholic  and Amy is agnostic  stating in  The Lunar Excitation  that she understands the notion of a deity but is skeptical of one that would take attendance   edit  Howard s mother In many episodes  Howard has loud aggravated shouting conversations with his overprotective mother who speaks with a Brooklyn esque accent  it s implied that she s in a different area of the house and therefore  has never appeared onscreen  She is dependent on Howard  as he is on her  The other characters frequently do impressions of her  Bernadette s rendition is especially accurate

program had been plagiarised by a show produced and aired in Belarus  Officially titled            The Theorists   the show features  clones  of the main characters  a similar opening sequence  and what appears to be a very close Russian translation of the scripts  90  Lorre expressed annoyance and described his inquiry with the Warner Brothers legal department about options  The television production company and station s close relationship with the Belarus government was cited as the reason that any attempt to claim copyright infringement would be in vain because the company copying the episodes is operated by the government  91  However  no legal action was required to end production of the other show  as soon as the word got out that the show was unlicensed  the actors quit and the producers cancelled it  92  Dmitriy Tankovich  who plays Leonard s counterpart   Seva   said in an interview   I m upset  At first  the actors were told all legal issues were resolved  We didn t know it wasn t the case  so when the creators of The Big Bang Theory started talking about the show  I was embarrassed  I can t understand why our people first do  and then think  I consider this to be the rock bottom of my career  And I don t want to take part in a stolen show   93   edit  References    As sold on iTunes Music Store   http   itunes apple com ca album big bang theory theme single
