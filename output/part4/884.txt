the only character to appear in every episode  Spider Man Peter Parker was not only a hero  but had several villainous appearances  in two episodes of the three part Alien Costume saga  the influence of an alien symbiote  costume  caused Peter to become hateful and violent  later in the series  Spider Man mutated into the dangerous Man Spider against his will  A one time high school  science geek   Peter was the subject of much ridicule  especially at the hands of Flash Thompson  After his parents died in a plane crash  Peter lived with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May  who doted and worried endlessly about the reclusive boy suddenly placed in their midst  During a class field trip to see radioactivity carried on by Professor Farley Stillwell  a spider crawled into Stillwell s machine and became irradiated  biting Peter in the hand and granting him the proportionate abilities of a spider  including superhuman strength  agility  speed  and a  Spider Sense  that warned him of imminent danger  Peter initially became Spider Man for personal reasons  seeking the popularity that he never had at school  Constructing mechanical web shooters in his bedroom  Parker set out to make a name for himself in show business  making television appearances and starting a brief career as a professional wrestler  It was after one such wrestling engagement that Peter s life changed for the worse  fame went to the idealistic Parker s head  and he refused to stop an escaping criminal  considering it  none of his business   A short time later  Parker returned home to find that his Uncle Ben had been shot dead by a burglar  who had then escaped to an abandoned waterfront warehouse  Following the murderer  Parker was shocked and ashamed to discover that his Uncle s death had been  his  fault  his uncle s killer was the same man that Parker had let escape earlier in the day  Devastated by his own actions  Peter Parker turned Spider Man into a force for good  promising to protect the city and its occupants  In his civilian life  Peter got a job as a photographer at the Daily Bugle  working for J  Jonah Jameson  a man who passionately despises Spider Man   and attending Empire State University as a college student  Spider Man once told a little fangirl of his named Tiana about his origins  albeit not revealing his secret identity  and after she helped him defeat Dr  Octopus in a battle  he willingly revealed his identity to her   and unbeknownst to him  Madame Web had him do this because Tiana was terminally ill  Over the years  Spider Man has gathered an impressive gallery of villains  including such notables as the Kingpin  Mysterio  Dr  Octopus  and the ever unpredictable alien symbiote known as  Venom   Several villains have discovered Spider Man s civilian identity  either by accident or via prior knowledge  the Venom symbiote originally bonded with Spider Man  and therefore knew of his secret identity by the time it found Eddie Brock  The first Green Goblin followed him long enough to see Peter take off his mask in an alley  And the second Goblin had gotten this knowledge from the first through a spiritual link after the first got into a dimensional portal after a battle with Spider Man  but twice  did the second Goblin gain and lose this knowledge through amnesia   Spider Man would be bearhugged by the Scorpion   the Sting of the Scorpion    Tombstone   Ravages of Time    Alistair Smythe as the Ultimate Spider Slayer Cyborg   the Ultimate Slayer   and most of all the Kingpin   the Spot  and  Goblin War     Peter would later discover that his parents were  in fact  spies for the American government  but were branded as Soviet double agents against the United States  However  he did manage to prove their innocence in the longest episode arc  the five part  Six Forgotten Warriors  saga  During the course of the series  Peter would also marry his longtime  on and off love  Mary Jane Watson  or at least a clone of the woman  unbeknownst to him until minutes before her death   and briefly dated the real Mary Jane before she disappeared into limbo during a pitched battle against the Green Goblin  she fell into a dimensional portal because of a machine the Green Goblin had that created portals leading into other dimensions called the Time Dilation Accelerator   By the close of the series  Peter had been chosen by Madame Web and the Beyonder to prevent the creature known as Spider Carnage from destroying all of reality  who was living in a different reality opposite from Peter s  leading a whole group of other Spider Men  all played by Christopher Daniel Barnes including himself in the show  from different realities to go against Spider Carnage  including the Scarlet Spider  who was Spider Carnage s enemy  In defeating Spider Carnage using the Uncle Ben who was alive in another reality that Peter and Spider Carnage went into  it belonged to one of the Spider Men who was rich and had his identity public   Madame Web fulfilled her promise to help Spider Man find the real Mary Jane   edit  Blade Voiced by J D  Hall  He first appears in the episode entitled  Neogenic Nightmare Chapter 9  Blade the Vampire Hunter   In that episode  Spider Man and Blade first meet each other  and it also marked the very first appearance of Whistler in any version of the Marvel Universe  as Whistler had never appeared in a comic book before  In this episode  Blade comes to New York to hunt down Morbius  after realizing it was not Spider Man  who he was originally targeting  who was sucking the blood out of the citizens of New York  It was also revealed that Blade was the son of a vampire man with a human mother  but became orphaned after his mother left him in a foster home after she realized she  too  would become a vampire from her mate  Whistler  who was a vampire hunter at the time  had discovered Blade with his unique potential of having all the strengths of a vampire but none of their weaknesses  except for the thirst of human blood  plasma  as it is called in the series for censorship reasons   Whistler took Blade under his care  trained him to use his vampire powers for good and helped Blade s vampire urge for getting human blood by giving him a serum which would make him more human  but only if he wanted to be more human  and the serum always worked  By the end of the episode  after Blade was almost killed by Morbius in confrontation if it were not for Spider Man  the latter teamed up with Blade so they could stop Morbius into turning all humans into vampires  Morbius told Blade this at the start of their confrontation   In the following episode  The Immortal Vampire   Blade once again makes an appearance alongside Spider Man  Morbius attempts to use the Neogenic Recombinator to turn everyone else into a vampire  Spider Man and Blade manage to stop him  Morbius  love  Felicia Hardy  persuaded Morbius not to turn her into a vampire and for him to become a human again  but Spider Man and Blade accidentally directed the active Recombinator at Felicia  but Morbius had thrown himself in the direction and became a full  incurable vampire   Blade also found a love interest in Police Lieutenant Terri Lee  who was a mutual ally to Spider Man  In the show s fourth season  in the episode  Partners in Danger  Chapter 7  The Vampire Queen   Blade returns and hunts down the Vampire Queen in Eastern Europe  as explained by Whistler to the Black Cat in the previous episode  The Awakening  who is revealed to be Blade s mother  Blade made his final appearance in the show in the 5th season episode  Secret Wars  Chapter 2  Gauntlet of the Red Skull  where he was seen working side by side with Morbius and the Black Cat against the Vampire Queen until the Cat was  abducted  by Spider Man  who used a teleportation device from an alien world  to help him in his battle against evil on his side of good in the Secret Wars  It should also be noted that in this series  Blade wore a costume based on his appearance in the Nightstalkers comic series and his subsequent solo series  In this series  he also does not wear his trademark sunglasses and his sword has an energy blade   edit  The Black Cat Felicia Hardy Felicia Hardy and her alter ego  the Black Cat  were depicted as the first potential love interests for both Peter Parker and Spider Man  respectively  rivaled only by Mary Jane Watson  She was voiced by Jennifer Hale  Felicia was the well bred  well to do daughter of business woman Anastasia Hardy  and had only vague memories of her father  John Hardesky  a career jewel thief known as the Cat  who had been imprisoned for years in the top secret and guarded prison of SHIELD because he had memorized the World War II super soldier formula  which would fall into enemy hands if he was kept free  As Felicia s civilian identity  she was a slightly petite  unlike her alter ego  but nonetheless a very attractive blonde with a crisp brogue and a sharp mind  In an episode where there was a charity ball  she danced with Peter and even kissed him  She briefly dated and fell in love Michael Morbius  Morbius ended up becoming a vampire during a science experiment and disappeared  After Spider Man rescued her mother from the Green Goblin  Felicia actually developed a crush  which later turned to love  on Spidey  Since she knew she could not have a relationship with Spider Man  she dated another man named Jason Philips  The latter was later revealed to be the Hobgoblin  ending their relationship when he was sent to prison  The revelations left her devastated  In the fourth season  Partners in Danger  arc  the Black Cat was finally introduced  as Wilson Fisk  the Kingpin of crime  whose civilian identity regularly worked with Anastasia Hardy   learned of John Hardesky memorizing the supersoldier formula and had him abducted from the prison known as SHIELD  The Kingpin sent Dr  Octopus to kidnap Felicia and threatened John if he did not reveal the supersoldier formula  Felicia would die  Hardesky told the Kingpin about the formula and it was tested on Felicia to make sure John was not lying  The formula gifted her with great physical strength  agility and dexterity  and the ability to alter her physical appearance  i e  hair color to white and costume change  thus transforming her into the more recognizable  comic  form  the Black Cat   She was originally a crook for the Kingpin to do his bidding  but soon teamed up with Spider Man and broke her father free from the Kingpin  putting Hardesky back into SHIELD on John s will  unbeknownst to either Felicia or her mother  the knowledge from Hardesky was kept secret with Spider Man   Spider Man and the Black Cat were partners for the following four episodes until the fourth season s seventh episode  where she teamed up with Blade and Morbius to track down and kill Blade s vampire mother  Miriam  Black Cat returned three times after this  first in the fifth season premiere  attending Peter Parker s wedding with the clone of Mary Jane Watson  In the process  she helped Spider Man and Kingpin  now controlling a robot called the Mega Slayer  defeat Goblin Warriors that were created by Alistair Smythe  In her second return appearance  she helped Spider Man save Mary Jane s clone from the clone of Hydro Man in the two part The Return of Hydro Man episode  At this point  she explains to Spider Man that she came back because she needed a break from vampire hunting and after Mary Jane was rescued  she says that she must return to Morbius and hunt down Blade s mother and that it s where she s needed  She then takes off to go back to Europe  Her final appearance was in the final two episodes of the three part Secret Wars  joining Spider Man s team as they fought the Red Skull  Dr  Doom and other villains  In the process  she met Captain America  sharing the origins of her powers  but not her identity  with him  In the end  she returns her feelings back towards Spider Man  After the Secret Wars ended  she rejoined Blade and Morbius with no memory of her experiences in the Secret Wars  like all the other heroes involved  except for Spider Man for a much bigger purpose  see above   This means that she ends up with Morbius  But it is interesting to note that she is still an ESU student at New York and has friends that believe she is just overseeing her mother s corporation in Europe for a few weeks  Therefore  it is very likely that she will return to New York with Morbius after Mirium is killed   edit  Daredevil Matt Murdock  the son of prize fighter Jack Murdock  was shocked to discover that his father had worked a deal with Wilson Fisk  the Kingpin of Crime  Running from his father in shame  the devastated youth was almost killed by a chemical truck hauling radioactive waste  which splashed into his eyes and blinded him  His father swore revenge against the Kingpin  for it was the Kingpin s truck that had almost killed Matt  however  the crime lord learned of Jack s intentions and had him killed before he could reveal the information to the authorities  for it was illegal to carry radioactive waste in New York  Wanting revenge on the Kingpin  much as his late father  Matt discovered that his blindness somehow heightened his senses to a near supernatural level  allowing him to navigate with ease in even the most unfamiliar environments  Training with his mentor  a man known only as  Stick   Matt took on the identity of Daredevil  the Man Without Fear  a vigilante who fought crime and whose primary priority was to defeat the Kingpin and bring down his criminal empire  Taking up the legal profession of an attorney  Murdock moved to New York s  Hell s Kitchen   a dingy  drug strewn ghetto  bringing Daredevil s fight for justice to the place where justice was needed most  Matt Murdock eventually took on a  very  famous client  Peter Parker  otherwise known as Spider Man  whom the Kingpin had set up  Teaming up to clear both Parker and Spider Man s names  Daredevil vowed to Spider Man  who he revealed to him that Wilson Fisk was the Kingpin  that he would not rest until the Kingpin was brought to justice  Though the Kingpin himself escaped  Daredevil still roams the rooftops and alleys of Hell s Kitchen  making certain that the corrupt never again pray on the weak  The Daredevil character only made two appearances in the series  first  in the two part third season episode  Framed  and then in The Man Without Fear  despite his infrequent appearance in the series  he has an important role in the Kingpin s past  and even revealed the Kingpin s true identity to Spider Man  for in the past episodes  Spider Man never knew Fisk was the Kingpin  hence  making his appearance a grand turning point in the series   edit  Nick Fury Nick Fury  an eye patch wearing war veteran thought to have been killed during a war  became the leader of the secret police organization SHIELD  He and the rest of SHIELD were involved in such adventures with Spider Man such as stopping the Chameleon from killing two international delegates from signing a peace treaty  fighting against the Kingpin s forces to reacquire John Hardesky for Hardesky s supersoldier formula knowledge and trying to stop the Kingpin and his rebanded Insidious Six from acquiring the Red Skull s Doomsday Device  The villain Electro destroyed SHIELD during the five part Six Forgotten Warriors story arc  Fury s whereabouts and present condition are unknown   edit  Kraven the Hunter Sergei Kravinoff In this series  Kraven  voiced by Gregg Berger  has a more heroic personality than he did in the comics  He made his debut in the episode Kraven the Hunter  He had a fiancee named Dr  Mariah Crawford  Seigei Kravinoff became Kraven the Hunter when Kravinoff saved Crawford from a group of jungle cats  and Kravinoff was seriously wounded  Crawford uses an immediate health serum on him  given to her by a former colleague of hers who was mutated while missing in Africa  to save his life  which causes him to become insane  and giving him extraordinary strength and agility in the process  Crawford moved back to New York City to work on a cure for the serum but Kraven tracked her down  believing Crawford was cheating on him with another man  Crawford teamed up with Spider Man to cure Kravinoff but Kravinoff even kidnapped Joseph Robbie Robertson  a friend of Spider Man s  because Kraven believed Robertson was the man Mariah was cheating on him with  But Kraven was cured by the end of the episode by Spider Man to prevent him from attacking innocent people  In Morbius  he makes a cameo when Dr  Crawford calls him from New York to Africa about Spider Man having his disease mutated  In Duel of the Hunters  a mutative disease turned Spider Man into a spider like monster which went on a Hulk like rampage  and Kraven was sent to track him down  His hunt was initially interrupted by the Punisher  who wanted to kill Spider Man  but they eventually worked together to track down Spider Man and restore his human form  In The Return of Kraven  he came back to New York to cure Dr  Crawford when Kravinoff gave the serum that made him become Kraven to his love because Crawford was dying from a disease that was plaguing Africa  turning her into Calypso  Kravinoff became Kraven again and tracked down Calypso throughout New York  with Spider Man and new comer superhero known as the Black Cat on his tail  thinking he is Calypso  But when Empire State University students Debra Whitman and Flash Thompson figured out Calypso s DNA  in which it was female  Spider Man and Black Cat figured out about this and heard Kraven s story  The three of them teamed up and when they gave Calypso the curing serum  it only half cured her  leaving her somewhere in between Dr  Mariah Crawford and Calypso  When Spider Man wanted to cure her all the way back to Dr  Crawford  Crawford herself refused and she and Kraven ran off somewhere in an undisclosed location  where their fates are unknown   edit  The Lizard   Dr  Curt Connors The Lizard s first appearances was in premiere episode titled  Night of the Lizard   Here  the Lizard was portrayed as possessing a genius level of intelligence but also having the savage mindset from the comics  His initial plot in his first appearance was to make the Neogenic Recombinator turn everyone around the world into humanoid lizards like him  but Spider Man stopped him and reused the Recombinator to turn the Lizard back to Dr  Connors  The Lizard later went on to appear in the episodes  Tablet of Time    Ravages of Time    The Final Nightmare    The Lizard King  and the  Secret Wars  3 part episode from the end of this series  run in 1997  The non mutated Curt Connors had many other appearances as a supporting character  Dr  Connors and the Lizard were both voiced throughout this series by Joseph Campanella  In the Lizard s four appearances between  Night of the Lizard  and the  Secret Wars  3 parter portray him as villainous and much more of a brute  even lacking signs of his intelligence that was displayed back in the pilot episode  But it is the Lizard s alter ego s  Dr  Connors  appearances as a mild mannered and well respected  innocent scientist who plays an important role in some of Spider Man s adventures  notably in Season 2 with the superhero s Neogenic disease  that makes the Lizard an ally  including his appearance in the 3 part  Secret Wars  episode  Dr  Connors The Lizard is a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde type villain  one half a well respected scientist  the other half a monster   edit  Doctor Strange Doctor Strange appeared in the episode  Doctor Strange   voiced by John Vernon  Dr  Strange and his sidekick  Wong  help Spider Man rescue Mary Jane from Baron Mordo and Dormammu  After that  Dr  Strange detected the presence of Madame Web  Dr  Strange s origin dates back before his debut in the series  He used to be an expert surgeon and when he got into a car accident  he lost the ability to use his hands  He then went to a mystic figure known as the Ancient One  expecting that the Ancient One could help him out with his problems  When the Ancient One refused to do so  Strange was left as a lonely and broken man but when he figured out the Ancient One s student  Baron Mordo  was planning to assassinate the mystic figure  Strange tried to warn the Ancient One  but Mordo prevented him  But surprisingly  the Ancient One knew of Mordo s plan all along and foiled it  exiling Mordo for his assassination attempt  But despite Strange s failure to warn the Ancient One  the Ancient One granted him mystic powers for being noble enough as to at least try to warn the One   edit  Wong Wong appeared along with Doctor Strange  in the episode  Doctor Strange  as Dr  Strange s sidekick  Wong wielded twin swords that were mystically enhanced  He was voiced by George Takei   edit  Madame Web Madame Web appeared in the Spider Man animated series  She was voiced by Joan Clayton  the wife of the creator of Spider Man  Stan Lee  On the cartoon  she had a recurring role in the third and fifth seasons  giving Spider Man cryptic yet always vital advice in his adventures and battles against his foes and eventually led him to the Beyonder  Instead of being a mutant  Madame Web was a cosmic entity of great mystical power  dwarfing Dr  Strange s powers   So apparently  she had no human origin  In the series  Web first appeared in a cameo in the third season s premiere episode   Doctor Strange   where she spied on Spider Man  Mary Jane  Dr  Strange and Wong after MJ was saved from Dormammu and Baron Mordo  and Strange even sensed Web s presence  She made a full appearance in the next episode   Make a Wish   introducing herself and revealing her knowledge of Spider Man s life and secret identity  In the series  her role was typically to act as cryptic adviser to Spider Man  offering him strange clues and riddles that would ultimately help him  as well as supposedly training him for the upcoming  Ultimate Battle   Spider Man s relationship with Madame Web was reluctant as he wanted to live his life autonomously  whereas she insisted he would need her knowledge for the upcoming difficulties  The pair did separate for a while because when Spider Man was going to quit in the third season finale  like usual   Web warned him that the two headed monster will rise above from the underworld  What Web meant by that was that his enemy  the Green Goblin  would figure out his secret identity  and Spider Man knew the Goblin was Norman Osborn  and the two identities would clash  When Web refused to bring Goblin and MJ from limbo  where they both got stuck into thanks to the Goblin s portal making Time Dilation Accelerator machine  under Spider Man s insistence  that is when they separated  But she returned when the  Ultimate Battle   analogous to the Secret Wars  occurred  which was after Spider Man s wife  Mary Jane s clone  had died off  due to her unstable cell structure which caused her to evaporate   After Spider Man had won in the battle against evil in the entire three part Secret Wars episode  this ultimately lead to the two part series finale of the show  Spider Wars  where it is revealed the  Secret Wars  was merely a test for Spider Man to see how formidable for the real challenge he would be when he would have to lead Spider Men from other dimensions to stop an insane Spider Man villain known as Spider Carnage from destroying all of reality  Spider Man succeeded and Web carried out her promise to Spider Man they would find Mary Jane throughout limbo   edit  Michael Morbius Morbius s only screen appearances to date were in Spider Man animated series  he was played by Nick Jameson  Morbius first appeared in his human form in  Insidious Six  two part episode  In these episodes  he has a romance with Felicia Hardy  a k a  the Black Cat   In the episode entitled  Morbius   he stole a vial of Peter Parker s blood in the belief that this was part of Parker s entry in a science competition they were both competing in  While examining the blood in his laboratory  one of the vampire bats he was experimenting on escaped  and began to lap it up  When Morbius tried to scare the bat away  it bit him  The bite infected him with Parker s irradiated blood  transforming him into a living vampire  He appeared as a villain in the following four episodes  Enter the Punisher  Duel of the Hunters  Blade the Vampire Hunter and The Immortal Vampire  along with  The Awakening  and  The Vampire Queen  in Season  4  In his earlier appearances  he goes on a rampage to turn everyone into Vampires  However he was stopped by Spider Man and Blade in The Immortal Vampire  At the end of  The Vampire Queen   Morbius stopped becoming an evil blood sucker thanks to a serum created by Abraham Whistler which suppresses anyone who has a vampiric urge for human blood  but only if they wanted to be human and joined forces with vampire hunter Blade and superhuman Black Cat  who was Felicia s alter ego that Morbius figured out in The Awakening  to stop Blade s evil mother  Mirium  Morbius made a cameo at the beginning and end of the second episode of the animated version of  Secret Wars   along with Blade  who were not only concerned about stopping Mirium but curious where Black Cat went  she was transported from Earth to the Secret Wars planet to fight alongside with Spider Man as one of the heroes to help him   That was the last appearance of Morbius in the show  A notable thing about Morbius is that the censorship for the show did not allow vampires to appear  So to allow the use of Morbius  he could not bite victims to drink their blood  Despite having fangs  and evidently being a vampire  he instead had to drain victims through blood suckers on his hands  And blood is only referred to as  plasma   The word  blood  is commonly used in non vampire episodes  Though  the words  blood bath   blood sample  and so on are used throughout the series  including vampire episodes   Also  in  The Immortal vampire   Morbius says to Peter  I need a sample of the neogenic blood you created    edit  Punisher The Punisher used to be Frank Castle  a police officer  Castle s wife and son were shot dead by a group of evil gangs and this caused Castle to seek vengeance towards criminals by killing every single one of them he could find around the world  with the help of his computer sidekick  Microchip  The Punisher believes he is not bringing himself vengeance  but punishing those who do wrong  hence the Punisher   The Punisher first appeared in the series when he believed Spider Man was a blood sucking vampire who kidnapped Empire State University student Michael Morbius  while Morbius was ironically the vampire all along  The Punisher had tried his best to hunt down and capture a mutated  six armed Spider Man  Suddenly  Spider Man had mutated into the Man Spider due to his life evolution  a giant man sized spider and then the Punisher was even more determined to kill Spider Man now  as well as with a challenge from Sergei Kravinoff  Eventually  Kravinoff and the Punisher teamed up to cure Spider Man and the Punisher called off his manhunt for the persecuted superhero  Later the Punisher returned in Season 4 when he felt like killing every single criminal was not working for his life and he wanted to do something good in one innocent person s life  Opportunity knocked for him and approached Anna Watson who was missing her niece  Mary Jane  who had been gone for some time in the series  Anna blamed Mary Jane s former boyfriend  Peter Parker  for her disappearance  The Punisher began looking for Mary Jane with Parker at the top of his suspect list  tracking him down wherever he went  The Punisher then tracked the Green Goblin  Harry Osborn  but could not find out what he knows about Mary Jane s disappearance as Osborn was too insane  But ironically at the time when Parker got back into his house and Punisher got him cornered  the clone of Mary Jane appeared  even though no one realized it was not the real MJ  and after a short reunion between Peter and Mary Jane s clone  the Punisher gave the clone to Anna and he left  feeling good on the inside of himself now   edit  Whistler Voiced by Malcolm McDowell  Whistler was a vampire hunter  When he went to New York City one time  he discovered a lost child who was a hybrid of human and vampire who had all of the strengths of a normal vampire but none of their weaknesses  except for their thirst of human plasma  Whistler then took the child under his wing  called him Blade and trained him to use his powers for good and hunt and kill vampires as he grew up  as well as giving him a serum that would suppress him of his vampire thirst for blood  but only if Blade wanted to  He told him how he discovered Blade to Spider Man and Detective Terri Lee in the show  Whistler had appeared first in the series in the episode  Blade the Vampire Hunter  which was also Blade s debut in the show  and last appeared in The Vampire Queen which told that Blade s mother is really now the evil vampire queen of Earth   edit  Iron Man and War Machine Iron Man was voiced by Robert Hays and War Machine was voiced by James Avery  reprising their parts from the Iron Man animated series around the same period   They first appeared in the episodes  Venom Returns  and  Carnage  in which Dormammu orders Venom to steal the Time Dilation Accelerator from Stark Enterprises  which is capable of releasing Dormammu from his own far off dimension  Venom is quickly defeated by Spider Man and War Machine  However  Venom gets help from Cletus Kasady  his cellmate who has bonded with another symbiote  Carnage  After the Symbiotes steal the machine  War Machine is too wounded to continue fighting  so Iron Man teams up with Spider Man and stops the Symbiotes and prevent Dormammu from leaving his dimension  Iron Man also makes a cameo in the episode called  The Spot  in which Tony Stark fires Dr  Jonathon Ohn from the Time Dilation Accelerator project because Stark knows the project is dangerous after Carnage almost released Dormammu to Earth using Accelerator machinery  Iron Man later appears in the three part episode Secret Wars in which the Beyonder creates a war between good and evil to see who is better  In the end  the heroes win and everyone  except for Spider Man who has to stop the evil Spider Carnage from destroying all of reality in the following series finale  is sent back to Earth without any memory   edit  X Men The X Men appeared in the X Men  The Animated Series crossover in the episodes  The Mutant Agenda  and  Mutants  Revenge  episodes  Cyclops  Wolverine  Rogue  Storm  Beast  Gambit  Jubilee  Jean Grey  and Professor X were featured as the X Men  In the  Mutant Agenda  episode  Spider Man s progressing neogenic mutation is making him ill and he seeks the aid of Professor Charles Xavier  In doing so he meets the X Men but is disappointed to learn that Xavier does not  cure  mutancy  only helps those born that way to accept and control their abilities  Dr  Herbert Landon and the Hobgoblin plot to destroy mutants everywhere  But Spider Man and the X Men work together to defeat them and end their plot  Later Storm appeared in the  Secret Wars  battle on the good side against the evil side   edit  Captain America and The Six American Warriors Captain America first appeared in The Cat episode as a cameo  in which Peter Parker is narrating a flashback scene about how Captain America got his powers while reading an article of John Hardesky  Later  Captain America appeared in the five part  Six Forgotten Warriors  episode  In this episode it is revealed that after Steve Rogers was turned into Captain America  the lab was blown up by a Nazi spy and the key scientist was killed in the explosion  However  the remnants were enough to create at least five more superhumans  But their powers were temporary  So they were given rings that would keep their powers permanent  as long as they kept them on  Black Marvel  Miss America  Whizzer  Destroyer  and Thunderer were the five superheroes created  In this episode  the Kingpin steals the rings from the five heroes to use the Red Skull s doomsday device  The Chameleon tricks the Kingpin and releases the Red Skull and Captain America  who were trapped in a time dilation loophole and never aged a day because of it  Later  the Red Skull unleashes the Doomsday Device by turning his son Kragov into Electro  The Six Warriors reunite  along with Spider Man  and defeat Electro and the Red Skull  However at the end of the five parter Captain America  Electro  and Red Skull get trapped in the time dilation loophole  again  Later Captain America appeared in the three part episode Secret Wars in which Spider Man choose Captain America along with some other heroes to defeat the villains involved in the Wars  which also included the Red Skull   edit  The Fantastic Four The Fantastic Four guest starred on the three part episode  Secret Wars  in which the Beyonder forces a team of heroes to battle a team of villains to see who is stronger  good or evil  The Beyonder had chosen Dr  Doom to be one of the villains  so Spider Man chose the Fantastic Four since they had a past with Dr  Doom  At the end of the story  after the heroes won  the Beyonder sent the Fantastic Four back without any memories of the Secret Wars  which had occurred for every other person involved in the Wars except for Spider Man  who had to deal with the evil Spider Carnage s plans of destroying all of reality in the following series finale   edit  Villains  edit  Baron Mordo Baron Mordo  voiced by Tony Jay  first appears in Sins of the Fathers Chapter 1  Dr  Strange  In the show  Mordo appears as Dormammu s minion  In his first appearance  he was ordered by Dormammu to steal the Wand of Watoomb to make a portal that would release him from his dimension  To do so  Mordo brainwashes Mary Jane Watson to become his servant  His plan almost succeeded  but Spider Man  Dr  Strange  his assistant Wong  and Mary Jane stopped him from freeing Mordo s master from his dimension  Mordo s origin is also revealed in this episode where he was once a student under the mystic figure known as the Ancient One s teachings  But when Mordo tried to kill the One  which was discovered by Strange who attempted to stop Mordo but Mordo in turn had stopped Strange  the Ancient One foils Mordo s assassination attempt and expels him  revealing that he had known about Mordo s plan all along  Later  in  Venom Returns  and  Carnage   Mordo was ordered by Dormammu to bring the Venom symbiote back to Earth to make Eddie Brock whole once more  Then  Dormammu orders Mordo to give Brock a message  At Stark Enterprises  Mordo disguises himself as Orden Bloom in order to get the portal  When Spider Man and War Machine join forces to fight Venom  Dormammu tells Mordo that there is another symbiote  which Mordo then bestows to Cletus Kasady  naming the result into the evil  Carnage   After retrieving the probe  Dormammu orders Carnage to steal the  life force  energy from humans  so he may gain enough strength to enter our world  When Carnage absorbs too much force  Mordo brings him back to his lair to drain the power into an urn  When Carnage moves to send the urn into Dormammu s portal  Spider Man  Iron Man  and Venom interrupt  Mordo ordered Carnage to throw the urn to unleash Dormammu  but was thwarted  Sacrificing himself  Venom pulled Carnage into the dimension following Dormammu s reversion  after which Mordo made his escape   edit  Carnage Carnage s creation was orchestrated by the evil demon Dormammu  The Venom symbiote had previously been launched into space aboard a probe by Spider Man  but  learning that it was on the verge of asexually reproducing  Dormammu had Baron Mordo bring the probe back to Earth  When the recently arrested Cletus Kasady witnessed Brock s reunion with his symbiote  he was soon offered the chance to merge with the symbiote s spawn  Becoming Carnage  he was sent out to capture enough  life energy  from human beings to provide Dormammu the strength to enter our world  Because of the degree of censorship placed on the show  this version of Carnage was quite noticeably tamer and less violent than his appearances in the comics  merely draining life from his victims  which was later restored  rather than killing them outright  He was eventually defeated by Spider Man  Iron Man  and Venom  as he  Venom and Dormammu were sent hurling through a dimensional vortex  He was voiced by Scott Cleverdon  In the series finale  the Carnage symbiote emerged from a dimensional portal into an alternate reality  and bonded with the emotionally unstable Peter Parker of that world  The joining of the two created the insane Spider Carnage  who was threatening to destroy all of reality  using an invention that combined the dimensional warp generator and an enormous bomb  The real Peter Parker  assisted by several other Spider Men from other universes  were able to convince Spider Carnage to fight the symbiote off  This was done by bringing in Peter s Uncle Ben from a reality where he was not murdered  Peter knew the symbiote was influencing Spider Carnage to commit this genocide  since they were in fact the same person and Peter could never kill another human being  Uncle Ben was able to convince Spider Carnage he could still be a hero as long as he had the courage to reject the symbiote  However  the Carnage symbiote was too powerfully bonded and despite Spider Carnage s best efforts  he could not get rid of it  so he threw himself into a dangerously unstable warp hole where he was killed by vaporization  Unlike the unpredictable but somewhat sane Venom  Carnage is thoroughly insane  and revels in chaos and destruction  taking lives at whim and without discrimination  Venom  on the other hand  usually safeguards innocent lives  possibly as a side effect of bonding with the sane human Eddie Brock  A life like robotic copy of Carnage and Venom appear in  The Haunting of Mary Jane    edit  The Chameleon Chameleon was an international hitman and spy  He also cannot  or does not  speak while he is in his true form  Though in the episode  Framed  Richard Fisk indicates that Chameleon told them about Peter Parker s parents  Chameleon has a belt  which is capable of capturing an image of a person  so that he can turn into a person to disguise himself  and then makes a perfect imitation of his disguise s voice  In his first appearance  he attempts to kill two diplomats at a U N  conference to start a war  but is foiled by Spider Man who easily picks the Chameleon out from the crowd since he had taken the appearance of Peter Parker  secretly Spider Man s alter ego  In  The Insidious Six  and  Battle of the Insidious Six   Chameleon became a member of the Insidious Six  In  Framed  and  The Man Without Fear   he was working for the Kingpin s son  Richard Fisk in framing Peter Parker for getting restricted government information  But Parker s name was cleared by the machinations of Spider Man and Daredevil  thus Richard and the Chameleon were sentenced to jail  Later  in  The Cat   it was revealed that he was jailed in S H I E L D  for his dangerous international activities and he was assigned by the Kingpin to release Felicia Hardy s father  Chameleon was infused with a techo organic virus prior to his incarceration in S H I E L D   which made him part machine and was able to change into any person without the belt  He successfully disguised himself as Felicia s father so no one would know the real Hardesky was abducted  Eventually  his ruse was uncovered by Nick Fury  Later  in  Six Forgotten Warriors  parts 1 5  he was rescued by the rest of the Insidious Six and became a member again  but would betray them and join forces with his foster father  the Red Skull  they have no relation in the comics   and his brother  Rhienholdt Kragov  who would later become Electro  In the end  Electro and the Red Skull  along with Captain America  were trapped in a time dilation loophole and the Chameleon escaped  never to be seen again  However  he was trapped by Spider Man and webbed  The Chameleon was presumably killed  when the Doomsday Weapon was destroyed once and for all  It was not mentioned that he escaped from the reactor room   edit  Doctor Doom Tom Kane took over the character for a three part guest spot in the final season of the show  re imagining Doom s role in the Secret Wars  In this episode  Doom turned part of the alien world he was on into New Latveria  However  he did not use his ruling powers for evil and had the aliens who lived in his country live in peace and harmony  He even kidnapped the Thing only to cure him of his deformity and powers  turning him back to Ben Grimm  After tricking Grimm into revealing the knowledge provided by Spider Man on how the Secret Wars began  Doom then stole the powers from the Beyonder and almost killed the superheroes that Ben fought aside with  But the Thing knocked Doom out and the powers of the Beyonder were returned to the mystic figure himself  Doom was then returned to Earth with no memory of these events  along with every other superhero and villain   edit  Dormammu Dormammu  voiced by Ed Gilbert  first appears in Sins of the Fathers Chapter I  Doctor Strange  In the show  Dormammu is a demon from another dimension who must consume souls in order to sustain himself  In this episode  he orders Mordo to steal the Wand of Watoomb to free him so he can enter this dimension and feed on the souls of New Yorkers  Dormammu is stopped by the combined efforts of Spider Man and Dr  Strange  Dormammu and Mordo appear again in the episodes  Venom Returns  and  Carnage   In these episodes  Dormammu orders Mordo to reunite Eddie Brock with his symbiote  releasing the threat of Venom once more  Mordo then orders Venom to retrieve a device from Stark Enterprises that can open portals from other dimensions  so that Mordo can bring Dormammu to this dimension  After seeing that Venom s hatred of Spider Man is preventing him from retrieving from the device  he orders Mordo to give the symbiote s recently born offspring to madman Cletus Kasady  which creates the composite villain Carnage  After retrieving the device  Carnage is tasked with collecting life energy for Dormammu in order for him to get enough strength to enter our world  which he does  However  in the end  Dormammu  Mordo  and Carnage are defeated by Spider Man  Iron Man and Venom  and Spider Man expels Dormammu back to his dimension  Carnage is pulled into Dormammu s dimension along with Venom  and with the device destroyed  thanks to Iron Man  who makes a guest appearance in this episode   Dormammu is stopped from entering our world again   edit  Electro Electro  voiced by Philip Proctor  made an appearance in season five  Here he was Rheinholt Kragov  instead of Max Dillon  During the course of Six Forgotten Warriors in which he appears  it is revealed that this version of Electro is the Red Skull s son and the Chameleon s half brother  In this portrayal  Electro is much more powerful than his comic book counterpart  as he is seen taking over the circuitry of vast machines and essentially brings all of S H I E L D  to its knees  He is only defeated when Spider Man tricks him into connecting himself to a machine made to generate a void in the space time continuum  which traps him inside a time loop  Electro appeared in most of the episode arc in the episodes  Unclaimed Legacy  The Secrets of the Six and The Six Fight Again before he became Electro and as the villain  he only appeared in The Price of Heroism   Electro appears so late and so different in the show because during the show s creation  a Spider Man film helmed by James Cameron was in production  Electro was to be one of the film s villains  alongside the Sandman  who was the only major Spider Man villain to never appear in the series  This is also why Spider Man s origin story was not told until much later into the show    edit  The Kingpin The Kingpin  Wilson Fisk  was the main villain  This Kingpin is fairly close to the comics version  but he is often occupied with manipulating super powered characters to do his bidding  He s the mastermind behind the creation of the Spider Slayers and is responsible for the creation of the Insidious Six  the animated equivalent of the Sinister Six  He s also involved in a power struggle with crime boss Silvermane  Initially he operated behind the scenes until a two part episode where his identity was revealed to Spider Man with the help of Daredevil  who was seeking revenge for his father s murder at Kingpin s hands  The Kingpin s associates here was first Alistair Smythe but after Smythe almost betrayed the Kingpin because he believed Kingpin was going to kill him for his son being in jail in the two part episode where his identity was revealed to Spider Man  Dr  Herbert Landon replaced him  The Kingpin was voiced by the late Roscoe Lee Browne in this series  This series also described an origin for the Kingpin  somewhat different from the comic book version  As a boy  Wilson Fisk was influenced by his father  who sought employment as a mob criminal  When older  Fisk assisted his father in robbing banks and jewelry stores  culminating in one robbery where his father escaped but Fisk  hampered by his already considerable weight  was captured by the police  In adulthood  after being released from prison  Fisk emulated his father s goal and climbed to a position of seniority within the mob  adopting the alias  Kingpin   He has had his police file destroyed  removing all record of his earlier arrest  He arranged for the arrest and conviction of his father  still an aspiring but minor criminal  and declared that he did this because  Sacrifices must be made   He maintains a strained relationship with his wife Vanessa  who is well aware of his activities  while his son Richard works for him  By the series finale  in an alternate dimension  the Kingpin was working with the evil Spider Carnage  the Green Goblin  the Hobgoblin and the cyborg version of Alistair Smythe to build a mind controlling device while Spider Carnage s real intentions were to destroy all of reality  The Kingpin realized this from the primary Spider Man of the series  After Spider Carnage s plans failed and he traveled to another reality to continue his plans  his building exploded but the mystical Madame Web saved the three Spider Men and the Kingpin from the explosion and sent the Kingpin behind bars  In the alternate dimension Spider Carnage traveled through to continue his plans  he teamed up with the corrupt lawyer of that dimension s Spider Man  who was Fisk  to rule all of reality  but nevertheless  Spider Carnage admits his real plans when he kidnapped the alternate dimensional Spider Man of that dimension s fianc e  Gwen Stacy  Kingpin bearhugs Spider Man twice in the series  first time in  The Spot  and then again in  Goblin War   The Kingpin states that about two percent of his body mass is fat  and that he is 350 pounds of muscle  Notably  the Kingpin has many enemies  other than Spider Man  his most recurring enemy  Among these foes of his include opposing crime boss Silvermane  and the two supervillains  the Green Goblin and the Hobgoblin  Also unlike the comic book version mostly every supervillain works for him  or he forces them to work for him  like he did to Doctor Octopus in season 4   edit  Green Goblin   Norman Osborn Norman Osborn was voiced by Neil Ross  He appeared in the series from the start  but not as the Goblin  Osborn was indebted to the Kingpin for various shady loans that Osborn was unable to repay  so the Kingpin asked Osborn to kill Spider Man to repay the loans  Osborn then hires Spencer Smythe to build Spider Slayers to kill Spider Man  After the plan fails  Osborn hires the Hobgoblin to kill Wilson Fisk  But the assassination is foiled by Peter Parker  and the Kingpin suspects a conspiracy against him  For his failure  Osborn fired the Hobgoblin  Hobgoblin then joins with Kingpin and kidnaps Norman s son  Harry Osborn  for the crime boss  When Hobgoblin sees that Kingpin will not pay him immediately  he eventually betrays the Kingpin by going to Norman for better weapons to kill the Kingpin and Osborn can have his company and son  Osborn gives him a better glider and weapons and by the time the Hobgoblin returned to the Kingpin  Hobgoblin realizes that the Kingpin knows he was going to double cross him  causes the Kingpin to flee  having the Hobgoblin think he died and took over his empire  The story concludes with the Kingpin  Osborn  and Spider Man all loosely allying themselves to defeat the Hobgoblin  who escapes after crash landing into the water  In the end  Osborn sells 50  of his company to the Kingpin in order to repay his debt  Harry Osborn is returned safely  and the Kingpin rebuilds his headquarters  Later on  in the two part second season finale  Osborn refuses to grant loans to Adrian Toomes s projects because Toomes was too old and senile  Therefore  Toomes became the villain known as the Vulture in order to try to kill Osborn  but as usual  Spider Man saves Osborn and defeats the Vulture  Later in the episode  Enter the Green Goblin  Norman Osborn and his partner  Mendel Stromm  were coerced into creating a formula for the Kingpin that grants superhuman strength  An unstable reaction resulted during one experiment and Norman disappeared in the explosion  presumed dead  His son  Harry  blamed the Oscorp stockholders  J  Jonah Jameson  Anastasia Hardy  and Wilson Fisk  the Kingpin   among others  for the death of his father  Soon a mysterious airborne figure  identifying himself as the Green Goblin  began kidnapping the stockholders one by one  Spider Man uncovered an underwater base where the Goblin intended to kill everyone he had kidnapped  Fighting the Goblin  Spider Man unmasked him  only to discover that the Green Goblin was Norman Osborn  rather than the suspected identity of his son  Harry  Amnesia ensued and Norman was unable to remember his dual identity  The following morning at OsCorp  he announced that he will no longer build chemical weapons  much to the Kingpin s secret dismay  Osborn appeared as himself again in the episode The Ultimate Slayer at an engagement party for Harry  who was going to marry Mary Jane Watson  However  the party was crashed by Alistair Smythe  recreated as a cyborg under the Kingpin s machinations  and Smythe kidnapped Norman  his son and Mary Jane  bringing them back to the Kingpin s lair  There  the Kingpin reveals to Osborn that Spencer Smythe did not die in the explosion back in The Spider Slayer  but that he escaped early on before the explosion ensued at OsCorp and was met up by the Kingpin  But rather than killing him outright for his failure with the Spider Slayer s goal to kill Spider Man  the Kingpin sees that he may still have some future use for Spencer  so he places him in chronological suspension  Spider Man overhears this and tells this to Alistair  who turns on the Kingpin completely  destroys his lair and takes his chronologically suspended father away with him  thus ending whatever relationship the Kingpin and Alistair had between each other  Spider Man managed to have saved Norman  Harry and Mary Jane  but unfortunately for Harry  Mary Jane decided to call off her engagement with Harry to be with Peter Parker  In Goblin War   Norman Osborn became the Green Goblin again after being threatened by the Kingpin that if he did not reveal the Hobgoblin s identity  who the crime boss was currently in league with  then Harry will suffer the consequences  In this episode  he and the Hobgoblin clash over Dr  Ohn s Time Dilation Accelerator  which was what the Hobgoblin possessed that lured the Kingpin into an alliance with him  Near the end  the Green Goblin tracks the Hobgoblin down to Jason Phillip Macandale s home  since the Goblin knew from prior knowledge as Norman Osborn that Macandale was actually the Hobgoblin  So he kidnaps Macandale and his fiance  Felicia Hardy  with the Time Dilation Accelerator  takes them to OsCorp and ties them up over a chemical vat to slowly lower them there to their doom  But Spider Man arrives just in time for a brief fight with the Green Goblin  saves Macandale and Felicia and nearly destroys the Time Dilation Accelerator with one of the Goblin s weapons  But  seeing that there is still some power left in the Accelerator  the Goblin takes his chances into a portal  stating to Spider Man beforehand that he d rather be trapped in limbo than be defeated again by the superhero  However  at the end of the episode  the Goblin manages to make it back into his own dimension because the Accelerator had more power than either him or Spider Man thought  and he starts to modifying the machine while plotting the downfall of his enemies like Spider Man and the Kingpin  the Hobgoblin is now jailed at this point because of his identity of Jason Macandale now revealed   In the next episode Turning Point  the Green Goblin finds out Spider Man s secret identity with the Time Dilation Accelerator  As Osborn  he nearly reveals Peter s identity as the superhero in front of everyone at Harry s birthday party  but when Peter catches on  he causes a fire that abruptly interrupts Osborn  Next  Spider Man and the Green Goblin s ensuing fight goes from Osborn s home atop the George Washington Bridge  But at the Bridge  the Green Goblin uses the Accelerator again  implying that he will go to Peter s Aunt May s home to kill her  But by the time Spider Man arrives  the Goblin appears and tells him that he decided to switch targets  implying that he is intending to kidnap Mary Jane  The Goblin succeeds in this task and takes her back to the George Washington Bridge  where he and Spider Man have their final confrontation  And during the battle  both Mary Jane and the Time Dilation Accelerator fall over a ledge  and the machine is accidentally activated  creating a portal which MJ falls into  Neither Spider Man or the Goblin know what happened  which makes Spider Man assume that MJ possibly died and vows vengeance on the Green Goblin  The villain tries to escape using the Accelerator again  but finds that it is almost out of power  Nevertheless  he manages to reactivate it before Spider Man could reach him  but accidentally creates an unstable portal that sucks anything in its path inside  Spider Man initially tries to push the Goblin in  but he then realizes that vengeance will not bring Mary Jane back  so he tries to save the Goblin  But the villain activates his glider to attack Spider Man from behind to push both of them into limbo  However  Spider Man s spider sense tingles  warning him of the glider coming in  so he dodges it  and the glider hits the Green Goblin in the chest where the Time Dilation Accelerator is situated  thus destroying it and pushing the Goblin into limbo all by himself  where the unstable portal finally ceases to be  Though this is the last time Spider Man and the Green Goblin would clash  this is not the end of Norman Osborn s saga  In the episode The Return of the Green Goblin  Norman  as the Goblin  contacts Harry through a spiritual link  saying that if Harry becomes the Green Goblin and kills Spider Man  then he will see his father again  Harry hesitantly complies and  figuring out thanks to Norman that Spider Man is Peter Parker  the new Green Goblin tries many times to kill Spider Man while having the Punisher track them both down  Harry goes back to OsCorp for better weapons against Spider Man and the Punisher  but Spider Man arrives and tells Harry that his father is the Green Goblin  which the latter confirms  to Harry s shock  But Harry realizes that this is his family s legacy to be the Green Goblins  so he confronts Spider Man and the Punisher again at the George Washington Bridge  Spider Man defeats Harry by tackling him into the river and destroying his glider  and Harry s unconscious form is taken by the Punisher back to Peter s house for interrogation as to Mary Jane s whereabouts  Later  after the clone of Mary Jane arrives to be mistaken by everyone to be the real MJ  Spider Man takes Harry to Ravencroft Institute to cure him of his mental insanity as the Green Goblin and make him think his knowledge of Peter being Spider Man as false  But in the fifth season premiere  The Wedding  when Harry hears that Peter and Mary Jane s clone are getting married  Norman contacts Harry again  inspiring him to escape Ravencroft and team up with Alistair Smythe  now under the employ of the Kingpin s enemy  Silvermane  to create Goblin Warriors  robot battle droids under Harry s command  He decides to use them at Peter and MJ s clone s wedding to kill Spider Man so that Harry could marry MJ s clone  but the Goblin Warriors fail to kill Spider Man  thanks to the help of the Black Cat and Smythe s Mega Slayer robot controlled by the Kingpin  and Mary Jane s friend Liz Allen tells Harry that she loves him  This makes Harry think that he s insane again  goes back from his plan on trying to marry MJ s clone and goes back to Ravencroft to be cured of his mental insanity for good  Norman Osborn appears again as Green Goblin in I Really  Really Hate Clones  the first part of two part series finale  in which he was working for Spider Carnage and the Kingpin in an alternate reality  This is simply a parallel version of the character in this other universe  as there was nothing that implied of the previous Norman Osborn  When the Green Goblin was confronting the Spider Men from different realities who had joined forces to stop Spider Carnage  all of them used their webbing to stick him to a floor of the Kingpin s tower  In the next episode  although he did not appear in it  the Green Goblin likely dies in an explosion that destroys the tower   edit  Green Goblin II   Harry Osborn Harry is voiced by Gary Imhoff  In this adaptation  Harry was Peter Parker s roommate in college  Their friendship seemed less strained and Gwen Stacy was not featured  Harry played an overall minor role  though he did act as a something of a rival for Mary Jane Watson s affections in at least one episode  After the original Green Goblin becomes trapped in the Negative Zone  he appears to Harry  Soon  Harry unwilling made into a replacement for and by the original Green Goblin  who contacted him while in limbo  Harry tried to kill Spider Man numerous times while the Green Goblin promised to allow Harry to see his presumed deceased father  Norman Osborn  However  Harry always failed  once getting into some trouble with the Punisher as well  In the end  Harry realized in horror that the Green Goblin was his father and instead of wanting to quit  he began to lose his sanity  Now acting as if he enjoys becoming the new villain  he continued to want Spider Man dead  This led to a fierce confrontation where Spider Man knocked him out while on the George Washington Bridge  He was then taken to Ravencroft by Spider Man  Later  when Peter Parker and the clone of Mary Jane Watson were getting married  Harry found out and grew insane  as he was in love with MJ  He interrupted the wedding and threatened to blow up the church the wedding was taking place  wanting Mary Jane to marry him instead of Peter  In the end  Liz Allan appealed to Harry  convincing him not to blow up the church nor marry Mary Jane s clone  Told by Liz that he is loved  he walked out peacefully and the wedding resumed   edit  Hammerhead Voiced by Nick Blair  Hammerhead s head is made of an unbreakable steel known as adamantium  which is what Wolverine of the X Men s skeleton is covered with  Hammerhead worked for the crime lord known as Silvermane and was with him when some of the other crime lords were plotting to overthrow the Kingpin  When Silvermane sent Hammerhead and his men to steal the mystic Tablet of Time  which can reduce the user s age  when it was arriving in New York  Spider Man foiled the attempt and the object was taken to Empire State University to be observed by Dr  Curt Connors  As for Hammerhead  Silvermane harassed Hammerhead for his failure and was thinking about replacing him with someone else  Hammerhead quit working for Silvermane and began to work for the Kingpin  When Alistair Smythe used his Mega Slayer robot to steal the Tablet of Time  Silvermane decided to blackmail the Kingpin after using the villain known as Tombstone to kidnap the crime lord s wife and Dr  Connors who knows how to operate the Tablet  Kingpin got back to Silvermane by sending Hammerhead to kidnap his daughter  Alicia  and a deal was made that if Kingpin give away the Tablet and Alicia to Silvermane  then his wife  Vanessa  would come back to him completely safe and sound  Kingpin refused to give the Tablet and Alicia away by the meeting where a brawl involving Spider Man occurred and Silvermane had taken the Tablet  Dr  Connors and his wife  Margaret  while Vanessa came back to Kingpin unharmed  Hammerhead tried to kidnap Alicia  but Spider Man stopped him and defeated Hammerhead  where Alicia subsequently took Spider Man away while Hammerhead was out  After Spider Man saved Dr  Connors and his wife  Silvermane was turned to a baby from overuse from the Tablet and though the mystical object was thought to have been destroyed in an explosion  Hammerhead had saved it and brought it back to the Kingpin so the crime lord could sell it for a large price  But the crime lord saw it caused Vanessa to divorce him and afterward  Kingpin demanded Hammerhead would get rid of the Tablet  And Hammerhead did by selling it to the villain known as the Vulture   edit  The Hobgoblin The Hobgoblin s real name was Jason Phillip Macandale and was voiced by Mark Hamill  In his first appearance  he was a criminal turned assassin hired by Norman Osborn to kill New York s most feared criminal mastermind  Wilson Fisk  also known as the Kingpin  in which the Hobgoblin himself did not know that Fisk was the Kingpin  Osborn was indebted to the Kingpin for various shady loans that Osborn was unable to repay  After the assassination is foiled by the appearance of Spider Man and Peter Parker when they save Fisk when he was going to create a criminology school and cause the Hobgoblin to flee  the Hobgoblin demands Osborn to pay him and he will take another chance to kill Fisk  But Osborn refuses to pay him and fires him  This sets off a chain of events in which the Hobgoblin is curious about why Osborn wants Fisk dead and while snooping around Fisk s building  he is captured and realizes Fisk is the Kingpin  Just when the Kingpin would kill the Hobgoblin  the Hobgoblin asks for a chance for a partnership with the Kingpin and defeat Norman Osborn  the man who hired the Hobgoblin to kill Fisk  Kingpin was so despised at hearing this news and Osborn for what he did that he aligns with the Hobgoblin and sends him to kidnap Harry Osborn  Norman s son  in order for the elder Osborn to make good on his payment  But when Hobgoblin sees that Kingpin will not pay him immediately  he eventually betrays the Kingpin by going to Norman for better weapons to kill the Kingpin and so that Osborn can have his company and son  Osborn gives him a better glider and weapons  and gets into a prolonged battle with Spider Man across New York  ending with the Hobgoblin presuming that Spider Man died in an explosion  Later  by the time the Hobgoblin returned to the Kingpin  Hobgoblin realizes the Kingpin knows he was going to double cross him  causes the Kingpin to flee  having the Hobgoblin think he died and took over his empire  The story concludes with the Kingpin  Osborn  and Spider Man all loosely allying themselves to defeat the Hobgoblin  where Spider Man fights the Hobgoblin in the Kingpin s lair and nearly destroys it  The superhero saves Harry  bringing him back to Norman and expelling the Hobgoblin from Fisk s empire  having the crime lord reclaim it as his own  The Hobgoblin tries one more time by trying to kill Osborn and his son  but Spider Man saves them and has the Hobgoblin crash into a nearby river  In the end  Osborn sells 50  of his company to the Kingpin in order to repay his debt  Harry Osborn is returned safely  and the Kingpin rebuilds his headquarters  Hobgoblin went on to make two more appearances  starting with the crossover of X Men  The Animated Series  He discovered that Dr  Herbert Landon  who was said to cure mutation   and secretly promising to make a mutant army for the Kingpin  was planning to exterminate all mutantkind  The Hobgoblin blackmailed Landon that if Landon did not give him the money he thought he deserved  then Landon s real intentions will be revealed to the public  However  Spider Man tracked the Hobgoblin down and learned that Landon could potentially make good on his threat  Teaming up with Wolverine  Spider Man tracked Landon to his lab  They battled Hobgoblin  who managed to escape with discs outlining Landon s master plan  Spider Man and the X Men managed to defeat an ironically mutated Landon after the Hobgoblin escaped  and Landon was taken into a hospital to be cured of his mutation  The Hobgoblin s next appearance was in the second Green Goblin story arc  in which his identity was revealed to be Jason Philip Macendale  fianc  to Felicia Hardy and had a portal creating machine called the Time Dilation Accelerator  Once his identity was revealed to his fiance  he and Felicia were kidnapped by the Green Goblin who stole the Accelerator from the villain and took both fianc  to their doom at OsCorp where they will be killed in an acid pool  Spider Man forced the Goblin into limbo  right before he would return in the next episode   saved Macandale and Felicia and their relationship ended  The Hobgoblin was then immediately taken into custody afterward  An alternate reality version of the Hobgoblin appeared in Part One in the series finale of Spider Man as an enemy of the Scarlet Spider  He battled the various Spider Men from different realities to try to stop Spider Carnage from destroying all of reality  suffered defeat  and was tied up  In the last episode of the series  the Kingpin s building  where the beaten Hobgoblin was kept  exploded  Madame Web used her powers to save Spider Man  his associates  and the Kingpin  but Hobgoblin apparently perished in the explosion  An interesting fact is that in his first appearance his skin was not white  but black   edit  Hydro Man Hydro Man was voiced by Rob Paulsen  Here  he was portrayed as Mary Jane Watson s former boyfriend  In an entire episode  Hydro Man stalked Mary Jane and Spider Man tried to stop him  but Hydro Man was too powerful in battle as he can create and control water  At the end of the episode  Spider Man and Mary Jane worked together to defeat Hydro Man  They led him away from any water source  weakening him so much that when he tried to attack Spider Man  he collapsed and  too weak to regenerate  he evaporated  In  The Return of Hydro Man   it is revealed that Dr  Miles Warren created the clone of Hydro Man  using what was left of the original Hydro Man from the ground he was killed on  However  the clone was still in love with Mary Jane so it demanded that Warren make a clone of Mary Jane as well  Even though it was hard to clone Mary Jane  she fell into a dimensional portal in Episode  41   Warren succeeded but Mary Jane s clone decided to be with Peter Parker rather than Hydro Man  When it escaped  Hydro Man later attacked them at Niagara Falls on their honeymoon  When all that was revealed by Warren himself  the scientist discovered that the clones were not stable and would vaporize  The clone of Hydro Man went first and then MJ s clone   edit  Man Spider Voiced by Jim Cummings  When Spider Man was bitten by the radioactive spider that gave him his powers  it also had a terrible side effect of giving him a disease that was part of his evolutionary cycle  The cycle would eventually lead Spider Man into becoming the sadistic beast known as the Man Spider  When Man Spider was terrorizing citizens in New York  the crime killing vigilante known as the Punisher and one of Spider Man s past enemies who was also one of his friends  Sergei Kravinoff  teamed up and temporarily cured Spider Man of his disease  How Spider Man permanently got rid of the disease was when he was fighting the villain known as the Vulture in the two part second season finale  One of the Vulture s powers was absorbing youth from people younger than he was and when Vulture absorbed Spider Man s youth  he also absorbed his powers but consequently  he even absorbed his disease  Vulture demanded from Dr  Curt Conners  who was treating Spider Man s disease at the time  to help cure him while at the same time teaming up with the Scorpion to defeat Spider Man after draining the disease back into Spider Man  However  Conners betrayed Vulture and only gave Spider Man back his youth and powers  but left his disease back in the Vulture  Man Spider was never seen again  with the exception of the two part series finale of the show where one of the alternate dimensional Spider Men was mutated with only six arms  as that was part of Spider Man s evolutionary cycle  but he became the Man Spider  Fortunately  that Man Spider was transported by the mystical figure known as the Beyonder into a different reality with him  Man Spider is similar to Man Bat from Batman by the character s opposite names like the regular Batman and Spider Man s names  But Spider Man and Batman are human and Man Spider and Man Bat are mutated forms   edit  Miranda Wilson Voiced by Beverly Garland Miranda Wilson was an actress who was nearly killed in an accident involving her movie  She had fallen into the river and her face was badly scarred by the time she made it to shore  She went through the catacombs hiding her face  Mysterio found

Peter Parker s science teacher at Science Camp  This relationship of former mentor and pupil made Dr Octopus fond of Peter even after his descent into villainy  One day  Octavius created a fusion experiment  using four metal tentacles  When the experiment exploded  Octavius  tentacles were permanently stuck on his back  In his first appearance  Dr  Octopus kidnaps Felicia Hardy and J  Jonah Jameson for ransom from Felicia s mother  as Felicia s mom did not have patience to fund Ock s experiments before he was a villain  When Peter calls him  Dr  Octopus decides to have Peter bring the

Forgotten Warriors  in Season 5  and one of the Kingpin s enforcers after the first episodes of Season 2  helping him commit crimes  He even came far as unmasking Spider Man with the Insidious Six but since Spider Man did not fight as good as he usually does because it was part of Spider Man s lively evolution  Ock thought he was a fake  He also came to wiping out Spider Man s memory and making him think the two were partners in crime  But thanks to Spider Man s fangirl  Tiana  and a cabbie named Mousie  he got his memory back and Octavius was sent back to jail  Ock eventually became aware that Anastasia Hardy s husband  John Hardesky  was a cat burglar known as the Cat and used this information to blackmail Mrs  Hardy into giving him his money  But he was abducted by the Kingpin and was forced to work for him and his plans were not to reveal to the world that Mrs  Hardy s husband was a crook but merely use John Hardesky because he was jailed for knowing the super soldier formula that

Beyonder to stop the evil Spider Carnage from destroying all reality  and helping Spider Man were other Spider Men from different realities  One of them had metallic tentacles like Ock and that Spider Man explained it was a  souvenir from my last fight with Doc Ock   It is unknown if that Spider Man killed or had Ock killed in his reality  even by accident  and stole his robotic arms  but it seems likely   edit  The Owl His only appearance was in the second season premiere of the series   The Insidious Six   where he is portrayed to be one of the crime lords with Silvermane and against the

battle petrified of the wall crawler  What he lacks in intelligence  he makes up for with brute strength and a huge horn on the top of his head  Rhino is loyal to the Kingpin  and refused to reveal any information about his employer to Spider Man  and chose to suffer prison rather than squeal on his boss  This loyalty was rewarded when Kingpin offered the Rhino a part in his Insidious Six  a team of supervillains he created for the sole purpose of killing Spider Man   edit  The Scorpion Real name Mac Gargan  Scorpion was voiced by Martin Landau in seasons 1 2  then by Richard Moll in seasons 4 5  In his debut episode  Mac Gargan works for J  Jonah Jameson as an investigator  but is nervous  plump and balding  In an attempt to discover Spider Man s real identity  Jameson hires a scientist to use Dr  Connors  Neogenic Recombinator to turn Gargan into a superhero called the Scorpion  This incarnation is similar to the original comics version of the Scorpion  with superhuman strength and agility resulting from his genetic enhancement  using the Neogenic Recombinator  with scorpion DNA  referred to by the scientist who carries out the experiment as  a natural predator of the spider    and an externally mounted cybernetic weapon tail  He encounters Spider Man on a roof top  and after a short battle is able to defeat the wall crawler  However  when he is about to unmask

the Vulture  who is as smart as Stillwell  and when Toomes  lab was blowing up  Scorpion saved him  In  Partners   where Moll replaced Landau  he makes another attempt to cure himself  but fails when Spider Man stops him  this attempt was a plot created by Spider Man because he needed Scorpion to give to Alistair Smythe to save the Black Cat   In  The Wedding   Scorpion makes a bank robbery and Spider Man is defeated  Then  he takes the wedding rings  so that he and his girlfriend Sara can get married  And finally  the Scorpion appears in the Six Forgotten Warriors five parter as his last appearance as a member of the Insidious Six   edit  Shocker Real Name  Herman Shultz Voiced by Jim Cummings  Alistair Smythe created the wristbands and electro suit that gives Shocker his power  Like the Rhino  the Shocker is loyal to the Kingpin  and served as muscle for him  accomplishing whatever was asked of him  He was originally hired to retrieve potentially incriminating evidence about the Kingpin from Eddie Brock  He was almost defeated by Spider Man and his alien costume when they fought in a belltower  He later joined The Insidious Six and again worked for The Kingpin to try to kill Spider Man  As one of Fisk s most loyal supervillains  he was called upon time and time again  Herbert Landon enlisted the services of the Shocker to kidnap Morbius and use his DNA to cure his

Hammerhead hired to capture Spider Man  In the end of Battle of the Insidious Six  he was rescued by Spider Man from the Kingpin who tried to kidnap him  Silvermane never enjoyed a normal childhood  as he grew into old age  he became obsessed with finding the secrets to youth and immortality  He heard legends of an ancient tablet which allegedly was inscribed with the formula to rejuvenate an individual s youth  the Tablet of Time  When the Tablet was unearthed and brought to the United States  he arranged for Tombstone to steal the tablet and kidnap Dr  Curt Connors  Lizard   who was studying its powers  Even with the intervention of Spider Man  Silvermane was able to kidnap Connors  wife and force Connors to activate the tablet  In the comic book the formula is for a potion  Connors prepares the potion for him  while the lives of Connors  family were used as a motivator for him to successfully decipher the tablet  Spider Man saved Connors but Silvermane took the potion anyway despite Connors warnings of it being unstable  In the animated series version of the story  Silvermane was transformed into a baby instead of being mildly rejuvenated  There  the tablet focuses the sun s rays into lasers which produce a greenish glow  Silvermane is initially turned into a young man  fights the Lizard then transforms further into a baby  The Lizard is bombarded by the rays and mutates back to human form  Dr  Connors concludes that they might by able to use the tablet to stabilize Spider Man s mutations  but the tablet is stolen by Hammerhead  now working for Wilson Fisk

his genetic structure with that of a scorpion to swap bodies with Spider Man  The Scorpion  meanwhile  in an attempt to go straight  was living with the Vulture  The Vulture  one of the originators of the Neogenic technology  believes he himself can use Silvermane s lab to make himself permanently youthful  During the Neogenic transfer  the Vulture intervenes  allowing Spider Man  the Black Cat and the Scorpion to escape  Silvermane and the Vulture exchange energies in the neogenic transfer allowing the Vulture to become semi permanently young again and reverting Silvermane back to an old man

After her father used the Tablet of Time and was accidentally transformed into a baby  she took over her father s job as crime lord  During her brief time as a crime boss she has hired and worked with Hammerhead  Tombstone  Ivonna  and the Vulture   edit  Spencer and Alistair Smythe Alistair Smythe was voiced by Maxwell Caulfield  In the series he witnessed his father s failure to destroy Spider Man  which  as in the comics  caused his apparent death   and was convinced to create Spider Slayers to later attack Spider Man as part of a deal made with the Kingpin  Smythe became Kingpin s primary accomplice for some time  even after Smythe s Slayers failed to kill Spider Man  His association with the Kingpin came to an end after the two parter  Framed The Man Without Fear   when Spider Man and Daredevil teamed up to fight the Kingpin  resulting in the arrest of Richard Fisk  Angered at his son s arrest  Kingpin blamed the incident on Smythe s  incompetence  and turned him against his will into the Ultimate Spider Slayer Cyborg with the help of the Kingpin s current replacement partner  Herbert Landon  Breaking free of Kingpin s programming and recovering his father s body  which had been kept alive in stasis by the Kingpin unbeknownst to him initially   Alistair found another employer in Silvermane  who promised to fund research to revive his father  His father was never revived throughout the series  Smythe kidnapped the Black Cat for Silvermane to coerce Spider Man into getting either Scorpion or Vulture  in order to have the de aged Silvermane restored to an adult  However  this plan was foiled thanks to the team up of Spider Man  the Black Cat  the Scorpion and the Vulture  Still under Silvermane s employment  he worked with Harry Osborn  the second Green Goblin  who had Smythe build an army of Goblin Warriors to attack Peter Parker and the clone of Mary Jane Watson s wedding  while Smythe also helped Scorpion with other activities  Harry s plan failed in the end thanks to Spider Man  the Kingpin and the Black Cat  Alistair also ordered Professor Miles Warren to create genetic clones under Silvermane s orders as revealed in the two part episode  The Return of Hydro Man  and worked for the Red Skull in the three part episode  Secret Wars  An alternate Smythe appeared in the two part series finale of the series  working for the Kingpin and Spider Carnage in order to build a mind control device to take over the world  However  Spider Carnage s real intentions were to destroy all reality  After Spider Man foiled his plans  Spider Carnage fled to another reality  leaving a bomb in the Kingpin s building  Though the Spider Men and the Kingpin of that reality were saved by being teleported out of the exploding building  Smythe and most likely everyone else in the building were possibly killed   edit  Tombstone Real Name  Lonnie Lincoln Tombstone  voiced by Dorian Harewood  was not originally an albino  he was turned into one by the same laboratory accident that gave him his superpowers  He was hired by Silvermane to steal the Tablet of Time in his first two appearances   Tablet of Time  and  Ravages of Time   During an altercation with Spider Man in Dr  Conners s lab  poison gas was released  choking Spider Man as Tombstone bearhugged him  who was unaffected because he claimed he did not need to breathe anymore  In fact  it is implied that he is a walking corpse  a member of the undead  Later on in the series  in the episode  Tombstone   Tombstone appeared again and became the leader of a gang that had Robbie Robertson s son  Randy  as a member  to kill the story of Alicia Silvermane being a gangster in the Daily Bugle  Tombstone promised to set Randy free to Robbie if he kills the Silvermane story  Robbie refuses and Spider Man captures Tombstone  having him sent to jail while Robbie and Randy confess to the police  Also  in this series  Tombstone s origin was different in the comics  He was once Lonnie Lincoln  a friend of Joseph  Robbie  Robertson who was not an albino  When he was a child  he accidentally threw his basketball through the glass of a grocery store  but  after seeing the store was closed  Lonnie decided to rob the store to get ice cream with Robbie s help  when it ended up closed upon Robbie taking too long with his homework   Lonnie ended up failing when the police came and arrested him  whereas Robbie ran away prior to the poice s arrival  After his release  Lonnie became a crook while Robbie graduated with honors at schools  Eventually  Lonnie made a break in at the Spaulding Chemical Plant to contact Robbie  While there  it was revealed that Lonnie wanted to frame Robbie to get his revenge for abandoning him back at the grocery store  After Lonnie fell into the vat of chemicals by accident  Robbie decided to stay behind to face the consequences to think about abandoning Lonnie at the grocery store  After the fall  Lonnie s skin turned white  his hair yellow  and his flesh tough and rock like  Later in the series  in the fourth season premiere   Guilty   it was revealed that the prison Tombstone went to was Ryker s Island with Richard Fisk  who was incarcerated two episodes before Tombstone   Fisk and Tombstone agreed to team up and frame Robbie Robertson  and Robbie was sent to prison at Ryker s thanks to the machinations of Fisk s father  the Kingpin  There  Robbie would live for the next fifteen years  He also met Richard and Tombstone there again and they revealed their entire plot to him  Apparently  Spider Man found out about this whole plan with the help of J  Jonah Jameson and rescued Robbie just when Richard and Tombstone would escape with their cellmate  also putting them back to jail   edit  Venom Real Name  Eddie Brock Voiced by Hank Azaria Like the comics  version of Venom  this version is a reporter named Eddie Brock  However unlike the comic story  Brock is introduced as an antagonist to Spider Man prior to becoming Venom  Also the series made much greater strides at establishing the rivalry between the two as well as exemplifying Brock s motives  and linking him to other notable characters  Brock s story begins under the employment of newspaper owner J  Jonah Jameson  Brock and Jonah setup to expose Spider Man on live TV  by capturing and unmasking him  However  when everyone believes that a phony Spider man was unmasked  Jonah fires Brock due to the humiliation of faulty journalism  1  Brock becomes a target of Allistair Smythe s revenge  but is rescued by Spider Man from the  Tarantula  Spider Slayer  despite this  the slayer s destruction ended up costing Brock another job  Again Brock blames Spider Man and swears revenge  2  Soon Brock would become bonded to an alien symbiote that was once attached to Spider Man  The symbiote s original origin from the comics  is altered however  the alien being brought to Earth from a Moon based space exploration  During their return  the astronauts are assaulted by the symbiote and crash their ship in the center of New York where Spider Man arrives to help  inadvertently collecting the symbiote when he leaves  Brock would next try to get his revenge on Spider Man by taking photos of him at the space shuttle crash  and convincing Jonah Jameson that Spider Man stole from the shuttle  Jonah re hired Brock in exchange for the photos which led to the news media claiming Spider Man was the thief  and Jonah placing a 1 million dollar bounty on Spider Man all as a result of Brock s evidence  Spider Man confronts Jonah and Brock explaining that he did not steal from the shuttle and calling Brock a liar  When Brock finally admits his fault  Jonah is quick to fire Brock again  this time for coloring the truth and leaving out facts  With his reputation shattered  Brock focuses on his hatred for Spider Man blaming him for all his troubles  Brock seeking revenge  follows Jonah and Spider Man to a church tower where Spider Man catches Brock and constricts him with webbing  Realizing that the symbiote s benefits are outweighed by the negative emotions it is creating  Spider Man uses the sound of bells in a church tower to force it to leave his body where it bonds with a webbed up Brock hanging below  3  Upon merging with the symbiote Brock gains the knowledge of Peter Parker as Spider Man as well as many of his abilities and declares that  From now on we re poison to you Spider Man  that s why we call ourselves Venom   He also reveals to Spider Man that he has vast knowledge of the universe but the symbiote s main goal is to survive  He seemingly has an advantage over Spider Man during their conflict but  Brock s plan to exact revenge on Spider Man comes to a halt when he is separated from the symbiote by Spider Man  and taken to prison  4  Yet he would later be reunited with both his symbiote and Spider Man  As a series adaptation of the original comic book stories  Venom s activities in the show are drastically different from the original written material  Despite the fact that he is a popular character  Venom was only featured in a handful of episodes  although he appears at the very end of the opening credits for each episode  even in seasons where he is not present   Brock s role as an antagonist changes  when he finds himself teaming with Spider Man  In the episode  Carnage   when his symbiote s offspring know as Carnage  tries to take his girlfriend through a portal  Venom tackles Carnage  and he loses his grip on her  Both Brock and Venom are sucked in  his last words being that he had always loved her  In his last appearance Venom  or rather a robotic copy of him and Carnage  reappear in  The Haunting of Mary Jane   before being blasted   edit  Vulture Real Name  Adrian Toomes Adrian Toomes  the Vulture  was voiced by Eddie Albert  In his first three appearances in  Ravages of Time    Shriek of the Vulture  and  The Final Nightmare   he is an old person  Later  he used the

Connors tricked him to hold on to his disease  which causes him to lose control of his youth  Then  Vulture kept changing from his young to old self  In  Partners   he seemed to have gotten rid of the mutation disease and manages to steal baby Silvermane s youth  In the  Six Forgotten Warriors   part 1 5  Vulture became a member of the Insidious Six  replacing Mysterio  who was originally a member but died in an earlier episode   edit  Other characters  edit  The Beyonder The Beyonder s appearance in the cartoon greatly differs from the comics  as he sports a goatee as opposed to having a clean shaven face  In all his appearances he also wore the brief  super hero  costume his comic counterpart Secret Wars II instead of the more usual disco outfit  He is also actually more of a good guy than a villain  The Beyonder first appeared in the episode  Arrival  of Season 5  the first chapter of that Secret Wars in the series  The Beyonder worked with Madame Web to prepare Spider Man for the Secret Wars  When Doctor Doom was defeated in  Doom   the third and last chapter to the Secret Wars  after the villain temporarily stole the Beyonder s powers  the Beyonder had all the heroes Spider Man had summoned to assist him forget their actions  and sent them home  Spider Man  however  was needed for something bigger  so he was the only one whose memory was untouched  It was revealed that the evil Spider Carnage had destroyed the entire multiverse with a giant bomb  However  when the destruction reached the Beyonder s own reality  he used all of his powers to roll back time  Though it tested him to the extreme  he sent his servant  Madame Web  into the past to train Spider Men from many different realities to find out which one would be worthy enough to lead the others against Spider Carnage  In the series finale  he was growing weak because he had stayed too long out of his own reality  but had managed to find enough strength to teleport the six armed Spider Man  who had mutated into a Man Spider  away back into another reality with him  That was the last time the Beyonder was seen in the series   edit  Big Wheel The Big Wheel appeared in episode named  Rocket Racer

research scientist named Dr  Mariah Crawford  who was engaged to Sergei Kravinoff before his mystic serum transformed him into Kraven the Hunter  She assisted Spider Man in several episodes  before she was given the serum herself by Kravinoff when she fell ill from an African plague  This transformed her into a feral woman who greatly resembled the comic version of Calypso  She was eventually half cured by Spider Man  the Black Cat and Kraven the Hunter and she refused to be cured all the way back to Dr  Mariah Crawford  running away with Kraven with the both of them with unknown fates  During her appearances  she was called Calypso by Kravinoff even before she became the beast  Crawford explained to Spider Man in the episode Duel of the Hunters that in Greek mythology  Calypso was a

turning him into a 30 ft  9 1 m  mutant  needing to feed on electrical energy to survive to compensate for the energy that his own cells were no longer producing after being exposed to the mutant  cure  while lacking any mutant cells for it to destroy  Luckily  the X Men and Spider Man were able to reverse the procedeure  but the accident left Landon with a permanent mutated half face  After that  he joined forces with Spider Man s arch foe  the Kingpin  and served as his key scientist  Following this  Landon was portrayed as half human and half reptilian  his mutant form   and Kingpin s

to get out of town  He stole a passer by s purse in order to fund his new trip  It turned out to be Mary Jane s purse when she and Peter Parker are in the process of apartment hunting but was stopped by Spider Man and Hobie was sent to jail for violating his parole  While in jail  he saves Richard Fisk from an attempt on his life  As payment  the Kingpin arranges for a hot shot lawyer to enable Hobie s release and gives him a special suit  He used the costume to get back at his old boss Iceberg  There are strings attached  however  the belt will detonate if he tampers with it  He and Spider Man team up against the Kingpin and destroyed the controls to the belt so it would not detonate and Prowler s suit is recharged  Hobie gave up crime so he can have a chance at returning to a normal  good  life  He was played by Tim Russ   edit  Rocket Racer Rocket Racer is voiced by Billy  Pop  Atmore  He only appears in the episode  Rocket Racer   Robert had great skill in gyro mechanicisms due

stop the Big Wheel when Rocket Racer had Spider Man electrocute the Big Wheel with two electric wires  The criminal was arrested  This taught Robert that education  not crime  would help him in the world to overcome his problems   edit  Joseph  Robbie  Robertson In the 1990s  Spider Man  Robertson is voiced by Rodney Saulsberry  and like in the comics was J  Jonah Jameson s right hand man and the person trying to have Jameson see that Spider Man is not evil  And also like in the comics  he was a former friend of Lonny Lincoln  also known as Tombstone  Back when Robbie and Lonny were kids  they last see each other when they wanted to get some ice cream but unfortunately  it was closed  Then Lonny accidentally threw his basketball through a window and he insisted that Robbie would help him get to the cold junk food  Robbie boosted him up but he knew the police would come  So he quickly abandoned him while Lonny was arrested  Robbie felt guilty about leaving Lonny on that point on  By the time Robbie got a job at a local newspaper years later  he would investigate about the Spalding Chemical Plant  He found Lonny  now a crook  there so Robbie can be put to jail so he can have his revenge for abandoning him at the grocery store  Robbie tried to catch him but Lonny unfortunately slipped and fell into a chemical pool where Robbie thought he died  In order to mend his mistakes back years ago since the grocery store  he decided to stay until he let the police hear his story and they let him go  But by the time he became Jameson s right hand man  Robbie was horrifed to figure out his son  Randy  is in a thug gang called the Posse  And worse  he found out that Lonny managed to survive falling into the chemical pool but turned into an ugly mutant known as Tombstone  who also lead the Posse  In the end  Spider Man and Robbie teamed up to put Tombstone in jail and also have Randy figure out the Posse was no place for him  But by the fourth season premiere of Spider Man  when Tombstone was incarcerated in Rooker s Island and wanted to get revenge on Robbie for what he did  he teamed up with Richard Fisk  who was also incarcerated in Rooker s and was jailed earlier before Tombstone  and with Richard s connections  they had Robbie framed and taken to the same prison they were so Tombstone can kill Robbie  But Spider Man and J  Jonah Jameson saved Robbie and cleared his name  By the Six Forgotten Warriors saga at the fifth  and final  season of this show  Peter Parker lied to J  Jonah Jameson that Spider Man was going to Russia to rule the world  Jameson believed him and Robbie went with Peter to accompany him and make sure he gets some pictures  Robbie acted weird while in Russia because he knew some people who would explain about Peter s parents when they were thought to be traitors to Russia  Robbie even knew Omar Mosley  who knew the story about the Six Forgotten Warriors  One of the Six Forgotten Warriors  members was the Black Marvel  who was said to be dead  and Omar said he was the Black Marvel s sidekick  but secretly  Omar was the Black Marvel himself   Robbie even figured out that Wilson Fisk was the Kingpin  By the series finale of the show  in the Scarlet Spider s reality  all of New York was destroyed with nearly everyone dead  thanks to the murderous rampage the Green Goblin and Hobgoblin have committed  The only survivors were J  Jonah Jameson and Robbie  Hobgoblin threatened Jameson if he did not give the broadcaster on the roof of J3 Communications  then he would drop Robbie off a ledge  Spider Man saved Robbie but surprisingly  Robbie hated Spider Man as much as Jameson did because here  in this reality  Spider Man was Spider Carnage and he was the boss of the Green Goblin and Hobgoblin   edit  Martha Robertson

considered him and Lopez very vague  The Spot used his portal creating abilities to rob banks and jewelry stores to get more money to fund his research  He then deduces that he works for a criminal like the Kingpin and wants to take over the empire  However  the Kingpin uses Lopez to have the Spot capture and kill Spider Man  The Spot confronts Spider Man but the hero defeats him  Spider Man is aware that if the Spot fails  Lopez would die and the two start to work together  In a battle to defeat the Kingpin  Ohn opens a portal that grows so big it had the potential to engulf the Earth
