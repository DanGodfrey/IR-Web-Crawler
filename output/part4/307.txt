of female characters that were in violation of the Comics Code  Since the 1990s  Catwoman has been featured in an eponymous series that cast her as an antihero rather than a supervillain  The character has been one of Batman s most enduring love interests and has been described as Batman s one true love  Many modern writers have also interpreted her activities and costumed identity as a response to a history of abuse  A popular figure  Catwoman has been featured in most media adaptations related to Batman  Actresses Julie Newmar  Lee Meriwether  and Eartha Kitt introduced her to a

history  edit  Creation Batman s creator  Bob Kane  was a great movie fan and his love for film provided the impetus for several Batman characters  among them  Catwoman  She was primarily inspired by Hedy Lamarr citation needed  and partially inspired by 1930 s film star Jean Harlow who at Kane s then early and  impressionable age    seemed to personify feminine pulchritude at its most sensuous   Wanting to give his Batman comic books sex appeal and someone who could appeal to female readers as a female Batman  Kane and writer Bill Finger created a  friendly foe who committed crimes but was also a romantic interest in Batman s rather sterile life   7  She was meant to be a love interest and to engage Batman in a chess game with him trying to reform her  At the same time  this character was meant to be different from other Batman villains like the Joker in that she was never a killer or evil  As for using cat imagery with their Catwoman  Kane states he and Finger saw cats as  kind of the antithesis of bats   8    I felt that women were feline creatures and men were more like dogs  While dogs are faithful and friendly  cats are cool  detached  and unreliable  I felt much warmer with dogs around me cats are as hard to understand as women are  Men feel more sure of themselves with a male friend than a woman  You always need to keep women at arm s length  We don t want anyone taking over our souls  and women have a habit of doing that  So there s a love resentment thing with women  I guess women will feel that I m being chauvinistic to speak this way  but I do feel that I ve had better relationships with male friends than women  With women  once the romance is over  somehow they never remain my friends  9     edit  Golden and Silver Age versions Selina Kyle s first appearance as The Cat in Batman  1  Spring 1940   Catwoman  then called  the Cat   first appeared in Batman  1 as a mysterious burglar and jewel thief  revealed at the end of the story to be a young  attractive woman  unnamed in the first story   having disguised herself as an old woman during the story and been hired to commit a robbery  Although the story does not have her wearing her iconic cat suit  it establishes her core personality as a femme fatale who both antagonizes and attracts Batman  It is implied Batman may have deliberately let her get away  by blocking Robin as he tried to leap after her  She next appears in Batman  2 in a story also involving the Joker but escapes Batman in the end  In Batman  3 she wears a fur mask and again succeeds in escaping Batman  Batman  62  December January 1950  revealed that Catwoman is an amnesiac flight attendant who had turned to crime after suffering a prior blow to the head during a plane crash she survived  She reveals this after being hit on the head by a piece of rubble while saving Batman while he was chasing her  Although  in one of the last issues of The Brave and the Bold  volume  amp  issue needed  she admits that she made up the amnesia story because she wanted a way out of the past life of crime  She reforms for several years  helping out Batman in Batman  65  June July 1951  and  69  February March 1952   until she decides to return to a life of crime in Detective Comics  203  January 1954   after a newspaper decides to publish stories of Batman s past adventures  and some crooks mock her about it  However in this story when Batman prevents a robbery and is knocked out by sleeping gas  Catwoman prevents her thugs from murdering him  though quickly claims she wants him as a hostage  Catwoman appears again as a criminal in Batman  84  June 1954  and Detective Comics  211  September 1954  for her final appearance until 1966  This was mostly due to her possible violation of the developing Comics Code Authority s rules for portrayal of female characters that started in 1954  In the 1970s comics  a series of stories taking place on Earth Two  the parallel Earth that was retroactively declared as the home of DC s Golden Age characters  reveal that on that world  Selina reformed in the 1950s  after the events of Batman  69  and had married Bruce Wayne  soon afterward  she gave birth to the couple s only child  Helena Wayne  the Huntress   The Brave and the Bold  197  April 1983  elaborates upon the Golden Age origin of Catwoman given in Batman  62  after Selina reveals that she never

has to break into it to retrieve it  Selina enjoys this experience so much she decides to become a professional costumed cat burglar  and thus begins a career that repeatedly leads to her encountering Batman  The Earth Two Golden Age Selina Kyle eventually dies in the late 1970s after being blackmailed by a criminal into going into action again as Catwoman  as shown in DC Super Stars  17  November December 1977   Catwoman made her first Silver Age appearance in Superman s Girl Friend  Lois Lane  70  November 1966   afterward  she continued to make appearances across the various Batman comics  Several stories in the 1970s featured Catwoman committing murder  something that neither the Earth One nor Earth Two versions of her would ever do  This version of Catwoman was assigned to the alternate world of Earth B  an alternate Earth that included stories that could not be considered canonical on Earth One or Earth Two  10  11  12   edit  Modern Age version  edit  Tangled origins

life and begins to study self defense and martial arts  Her teacher inspires Selina to become more than what she has been and she realizes that prostitution is no life for her  or for Holly  Holly Robinson is a young runaway who idolizes Selina  but is much too young to be on the streets as far as Selina is concerned  Selina shares her home with Holly after she takes her in  As the story progresses Selina is led to a bit of burglary  she dons a catsuit costume that her now former pimp gave to her the day that she told him she was out of the business  After costuming herself so as not to be revealed  she gets a taste for burglary and begins to do it in more of a Robin Hood way than an actual thief  This is  however  how she runs into Batman  After a small confrontation  she begins to be inspired to stay in her costume and become the  Catwoman  after seeing Batman in action with others  Selina gets the idea that  if there is a  bat   why can there not be a  cat   The 1989

this time  a client gives her a cat o  nine tails  which Selina kept as a trophy  Batman  Dark Victory  the sequel to The Long Halloween  implies that Catwoman suspects she is the illegitimate daughter of mafia boss Carmine Falcone  although she finds no definitive proof  Selina s connection to the Falcone family is further explored in the miniseries Catwoman  When in Rome  Though the story adds more circumstantial evidence to the theory of Selina s Falcone heritage  establishing that the Falcones  secondborn daughter was put up for adoption in America  it also supplies no definitive proof  During The Long Halloween  Selina  out of costume  develops a relationship with Bruce Wayne  even leading her to save Bruce from Poison Ivy  However  this relationship appears to end on the Fourth of July when Bruce rejects her advances twice once as Bruce  and once as Batman  She leaves him for good and also leaves Gotham for a while in Batman  Dark Victory  after he stands her up on

Silver Age  Catwoman  like most Batman villains  used a variety of themed weapons  vehicles  and equipment  such as a custom cat themed car called the  Cat illac   This usage also appeared in the 1960s Batman television series  In her post Crisis appearances  Catwoman s favored weapon is a whip  She wields both a standard bullwhip and the cat o  nine tails with expert proficiency  She uses the whip because it is a weapon that the user must be trained to use  and therefore it can not be taken from her and used against her in a confrontation  She can also be seen using a pistol against people if her whip is taken from her  She uses caltrops as an anti personnel weapon and bolas to entangle opponents at a distance  In addition  Catwoman has been shown to have various items to restrain her victims  such as a set of plastic ties for binding hands and feet  and a roll of duct tape used to gag her targets  like she did with Angle Man  Film Freak  Zatanna  and various others during her robberies over the years  Often  especially in the TV series  she uses sleeping gas or knockout darts to subdue victims  Catwoman s attractiveness and feminine wiles have also allowed her to take advantage of male opponents   edit  Costume Catwoman  in her first appearance  wore no costume or disguise at all  It was not until her next appearance that she donned a mask  which was a theatrically face covering cat mask that had the appearance of a real cat  rather than a more stylized face mask seen in her later incarnations  Later  she wore a dress with a hood that came with ears  and still later  a catsuit with attached boots and either a domino or glasses mask  In the 1960s  Catwoman s catsuit was green in color  which was typical of villains of that era  In the 1990s  she usually wore a skintight purple catsuit  before switching to a black PVC catsuit that recalls Michelle Pfeiffer s costume in Batman Returns  except not stitched together   In recent years  artists  depictions have usually alternated between those two costumes  Ed Brubaker  the writer behind the 2001 revamp of the character  has stated that Selina s current costume was inspired by Emma Peel s iconic leather catsuit in The Avengers television series  34  It has a more high tech look  with domino shaped infrared goggles on her cowl  Many of her costumes have incorporated retractable metal claws on the fingertips of her gloves and sometimes on the toes of her boots  On rare occasions  she has also sported a cat s tail  Holly Robinson uses the same costume Selina used prior to Infinite Crisis   edit
