Nations The Chilean delegation signing the UN Charter in San Francisco  1945 The League of Nations failed to prevent World War II  1939 1945   Because of the widespread recognition that humankind could not afford a third world war  the United Nations was established to replace the flawed League of Nations in 1945 in order to maintain international peace and promote cooperation in solving international economic  social and humanitarian problems  The earliest concrete plan for a new world organization was begun under the aegis of the U S  State Department in 1939  Franklin D  Roosevelt first coined the term  United Nations  as a term to describe the Allied countries  The term was first officially used on 1 January 1942  when 26 governments signed the Atlantic Charter  pledging to continue the war effort  3  On 25 April 1945  the UN Conference on International Organization began in San Francisco  attended by 50 governments and a number of non governmental organizations involved in drafting the United Nations Charter  The UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945 upon ratification of the Charter by the five then permanent members of the Security Council France  the Republic of China  the Soviet Union  the United Kingdom and the United States and by a majority of the other 46 signatories  The first meetings of the General Assembly  with 51 nations represented  and the Security Council  took place in Westminster Central Hall in London in January 1946  4  The organization was based at the Sperry Gyroscope Corporation s facility in Lake Success  New York  from 1946 1952  before moving to the United Nations Headquarters building in Manhattan upon its completion  Since its creation  there has been controversy and criticism of the United Nations  In the United States  an early opponent of the UN was the John Birch Society  which began a  get US out of the UN  campaign in 1959  charging that the UN s aim was to establish a  One World Government   After the Second World War  the French Committee of National Liberation was late to be recognized by the US as the government of France  and so the country was initially excluded from the conferences that aimed at creating the new organization  Charles de Gaulle criticized the UN  famously calling it le machin   the thing    and was not convinced that a global security alliance would help maintain world peace  preferring direct defence treaties between countries  5  Legal basis of establishment Shortly after its establishment the UN sought recognition as an international legal person due to the case of Reparations for Injuries Suffered in the Service of the United Nations 6  with the advisory opinion delivered by the International Court of Justice  ICJ   The question arose whether the United Nations  as an organisation  had  the capacity to bring an international claim against a government regarding injuries that the organisation alleged had been caused by that state   7  The Court stated  the Organization was intended to exercise and enjoy  and is in fact exercising and enjoying functions and rights  which can only be explained on the basis of the possession of a large measure of international personality and the capacity to operate upon an international plane     Accordingly  the Court has come to the conclusion that the Organization is an international person  That is not the same thing as saying that it is a State  which it certainly is not  or that its legal personality and rights and duties are the same as those of a State     What it does mean is that it is a subject of international law and capable of possessing international rights and duties  and that it has capacity to maintain its rights by bringing international claims  8  Organization Main article  United Nations System The United Nations  system is based on five principal organs  formerly six   the Trusteeship Council suspended operations in 1994  upon the independence of Palau  the last remaining UN trustee territory   9  the General Assembly  the Security Council  the Economic and Social Council  ECOSOC   the Secretariat  and the International Court of Justice  Four of the five principal organs are located at the main United Nations Headquarters located on international territory in New York City  10  The International Court of Justice is located in The Hague  while other major agencies are based in the UN offices at Geneva  11 Vienna  12  and Nairobi  13  Other UN institutions are located throughout the world  The six official languages of the United Nations  used in intergovernmental meetings and documents  are Arabic  Chinese  English  French  Russian  and Spanish  2  The Secretariat uses two working languages  English and French  Four of the official languages are the national languages of the permanent members of the Security Council  the United Kingdom and the United States share English as a de facto official language   Spanish and Arabic are the languages of the two largest blocs of official languages outside of the permanent members  Spanish being official in 20 countries  Arabic in 26   Five of the official languages were chosen when the UN was founded  Arabic was added later in 1973  The United Nations Editorial Manual states that the standard for English language documents is British usage and Oxford spelling  the Chinese writing standard is Simplified Chinese  This replaced Traditional Chinese in 1971 when the UN representation of China was changed from the Republic of China to the People s Republic of China  see China and the United Nations for details   General Assembly United Nations General Assembly hall Main article  United Nations General Assembly The General Assembly is the main deliberative assembly of the United Nations  Composed of all United Nations member states  the assembly meets in regular yearly sessions under a president elected from among the member states  Over a two week period at the start of each session  all members have the opportunity to address the assembly  Traditionally  the Secretary General makes the first statement  followed by the president of the assembly  The first session was convened on 10 January 1946 in the Westminster Central Hall in London and included representatives of 51 nations  When the General Assembly votes on important questions  a two thirds majority of those present and voting is required  Examples of important questions include  recommendations on peace and security  election of members to organs  admission  suspension  and expulsion of members  and  budgetary matters  All other questions are decided by majority vote  Each member country has one vote  Apart from approval of budgetary matters  resolutions are not binding on the members  The Assembly may make recommendations on any matters within the scope of the UN  except matters of peace and security that are under Security Council consideration  Conceivably  the one state  one vote power structure could enable states comprising just eight percent of the world population to pass a resolution by a two thirds vote  see List of countries by population   However  as no more than recommendations  it is difficult to imagine a situation in which a recommendation by member states constituting just eight percent of the world s population  would be adhered to by the remaining ninety two percent of the population  should they object  citation needed  Security Council United Nations Security Council chamber Main article  United Nations Security Council The Security Council is charged with maintaining peace and security among countries  While other organs of the United Nations can only make  recommendations  to member governments  the Security Council has the power to make binding decisions that member governments have agreed to carry out  under the terms of Charter Article 25  14  The decisions of the Council are known as United Nations Security Council resolutions  The Security Council is made up of 15 member states  consisting of 5 permanent members China  France  Russia  the United Kingdom and the United States and 10 non permanent members  currently Azerbaijan  India  South Africa  Colombia  Morocco  Togo  Germany  Pakistan  Guatemala  and Portugal  15  The five permanent members hold veto power over substantive but not procedural resolutions allowing a permanent member to block adoption but not to block the debate of a resolution unacceptable to it  The ten temporary seats are held for two year terms with member states voted in by the General Assembly on a regional basis  The presidency of the Security Council is rotated alphabetically each month  16  Secretariat Main article  United Nations Secretariat The United Nations Secretariat Building at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City  The United Nations Secretariat is headed by the Secretary General  assisted by a staff of international civil servants worldwide  It provides studies  information  and facilities needed by United Nations bodies for their meetings  It also carries out tasks as directed by the UN Security Council  the UN General Assembly  the UN Economic and Social Council  and other UN bodies  The United Nations Charter provides that the staff be chosen by application of the  highest standards of efficiency  competence  and integrity   with due regard for the importance of recruiting on a wide geographical basis  The Charter provides that the staff shall not seek or receive instructions from any authority other than the UN  Each UN member country is enjoined to respect the international character of the Secretariat and not seek to influence its staff  The Secretary General alone is responsible for staff selection  The Secretary General s duties include helping resolve international disputes  administering peacekeeping operations  organizing international conferences  gathering information on the implementation of Security Council decisions  and consulting with member governments regarding various initiatives  Key Secretariat offices in this area include the Office of the Coordinator of Humanitarian Affairs and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations  The Secretary General may bring to the attention of the Security Council any matter that  in his or her opinion  may threaten international peace and security  citation needed  Secretary General Main article  Secretary General of the United Nations The current Secretary General  Ban Ki moon The Secretariat is headed by the Secretary General  who acts as the de facto spokesperson and leader of the UN  The current Secretary General is Ban Ki moon  who took over from Kofi Annan in 2007 and has been elected for a second term to conclude at the end of 2016  17  Envisioned by Franklin D  Roosevelt as a  world moderator   the position is defined in the UN Charter as the organization s  chief administrative officer   18  but the Charter also states that the Secretary General can bring to the Security Council s attention  any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security   19  giving the position greater scope for action on the world stage  The position has evolved into a dual role of an administrator of the UN organization  and a diplomat and mediator addressing disputes between member states and finding consensus to global issues  20  The Secretary General is appointed by the General Assembly  after being recommended by the Security Council  where the permanent members have veto power  21  The General Assembly can theoretically override the Security Council s recommendation if a majority vote is not achieved  although this has not happened so far  22  There are no specific criteria for the post  but over the years  it has become accepted that the post shall be held for one or two terms of five years  that the post shall be appointed on the basis of geographical rotation  and that the Secretary General shall not originate from one of the five permanent Security Council member states  22  Secretaries General of the United Nations 23  No  Name Country of origin

January 2007 Incumbent International Court of Justice Peace Palace  seat of the International Court of Justice at The Hague  Netherlands Main article  International Court of Justice The International Court of Justice  ICJ   located in The Hague  Netherlands  is the primary judicial organ of the United Nations  Established in 1945 by the United Nations Charter  the Court began work in 1946 as the successor to the Permanent Court of International Justice  The Statute of the International Court of Justice  similar to that of its predecessor  is the main constitutional document constituting and regulating the Court  24  It is based in the Peace Palace in The Hague  Netherlands  sharing the building with the Hague Academy of International Law  a private centre for the study of international law  Several of the Court s current judges are either alumni or former faculty members of the Academy  Its purpose is to adjudicate disputes among states  The court has heard cases related to war crimes  illegal state interference and ethnic cleansing  among others  and continues to hear cases  25  International Criminal Court Main article  International Criminal Court The International Criminal Court  ICC   it came into being on 1 July 2002 with the entering into force of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court which was adopted on 17 July 1998  It is the first permanent international court charged with trying those who commit the most serious crimes under international law  including war crimes  genocide  crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression  although it cannot exercise jurisdiction over this crime prior to 2017   The ICC is functionally independent of the UN in terms of personnel and financing  but some meetings of the ICC governing body  the Assembly of the States Parties to the Rome Statute  are held at the United Nations  There is a  relationship agreement  between the ICC and the UN that governs how the two institutions regard each other legally  26  Economic and Social Council Main article  United Nations Economic and Social Council The ECOSOC chamber The Economic and Social Council  ECOSOC  assists the General Assembly in promoting international economic and social cooperation and development  ECOSOC has 54 members  all of which are elected by the General Assembly for a three year term  The president is elected for a one year term and chosen amongst the small or middle powers represented on ECOSOC  ECOSOC meets once a year in July for a four week session  Since 1998  it has held another meeting each April with finance ministers heading key committees of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund  IMF   Viewed separate from the specialized bodies it coordinates  ECOSOC s functions include information gathering  advising member nations  and making recommendations  In addition  ECOSOC is well positioned to provide policy coherence and coordinate the overlapping functions of the UN s subsidiary bodies and it is in these roles that it is most active  Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues Main article  United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues The United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues  UNPFII or PFII  is the UN s central coordinating body for matters relating to the concerns and rights of the world s indigenous peoples  The forum  which evolved from the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations  is an advisory body within the framework of the United Nations System that reports to the UN s Economic and Social Council  ECOSOC   however  it performs an advisory function in relation to other branches of the United Nations system  It also works with other U N  bodies as they address indigenous rights through Conventions such as the International Labour Organization s Convention No 169 and the Convention on Biological Diversity  Article 8j   27  The Forum s mandate is to  Provide expert advice and recommendations to the Economic and Social Council and to the various programmes  funds and agencies of the United Nations System through the Council  Raise awareness and promote the integration and coordination of activities related to indigenous issues within the UN system  Prepare and disseminate information on these issues  Since the passage of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007  much of the work of UNPFII has surrounded the compliance of U N  member states to the standards of that declaration  27  However  it performs many other international functions as well  28  Specialized institutions Main article  List of specialized agencies of the United Nations Many UN organizations and agencies exist to work on particular issues  Some of the most well known agencies are the International Atomic Energy Agency  the Food and Agriculture Organization  UNESCO  United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization   the World Bank and the World Health Organization  It is through these agencies that the UN performs most of its humanitarian work  Examples include mass vaccination programmes  through the WHO   the avoidance of famine and malnutrition  through the work of the WFP  and the protection of vulnerable and displaced people  for example  by the UNHCR   The United Nations Charter stipulates that each primary organ of the UN can establish various specialized agencies to fulfil its duties  Organizations and specialized agencies of the United Nations No  Acronyms Logo Agency Headquarters Head Established in 1 FAO Food and Agriculture

political control of Western Sahara is in dispute  and the territories administered by the Republic of China  Taiwan  and Kosovo are considered by the UN to be provinces of the People s Republic of China and Republic of Serbia  respectively  With the addition of South Sudan on 14 July 2011  29  there are currently 193 United Nations member states  including all fully recognized independent states 30  apart from Vatican City  the Holy See  which holds sovereignty over the state of Vatican City  is a permanent observer   31  The United Nations Charter outlines the rules for membership  Membership in the United Nations is open to all other peace loving states that accept the obligations contained in the present Charter and  in the judgment of the Organization  are able and willing to carry out these obligations  The admission of any such state to membership in the United Nations will be effected by a decision of the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council   United Nations Charter  Chapter 2  Article 4  http   www un org aboutun charter  Group of 77 The Group of 77 at the UN is a loose coalition of developing nations  designed to promote its members  collective economic interests and create an enhanced joint negotiating capacity in the United Nations  There were 77 founding members of the organization  but the organization has since expanded to 130 member countries  The group was founded on 15 June 1964 by the  Joint Declaration of the Seventy Seven Countries  issued at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  UNCTAD   The first major meeting was in Algiers in 1967  where the Charter of Algiers was adopted and the basis for permanent institutional structures was begun  32  Stated objectives Peacekeeping and security Main article  United Nations peacekeeping See also  List of United Nations peacekeeping missions Darfur Western Sahara Israel Palestine Kosovo Cyprus Golan Lebanon Haiti Liberia C te d Ivoire DR Congo Sudan East Timor Jammu and Kashmir Afghanistan Current UN peacekeeping missions The UN  after approval by the Security Council  sends peacekeepers to regions where armed conflict has recently ceased or paused to enforce the terms of peace agreements and to discourage combatants from resuming hostilities  Since the UN does not maintain its own military  peacekeeping forces are voluntarily provided by member states of the UN  The forces  also called the  Blue Helmets   who enforce UN accords  are awarded United Nations Medals  which are considered international decorations instead of military decorations  The peacekeeping force as a whole received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988  33  The founders of the UN had envisaged that the organization would act to prevent conflicts between nations and make future wars impossible  however the outbreak of the Cold War made peacekeeping agreements extremely difficult because of the division of the world into hostile camps  Following the end of the Cold War  there were renewed calls for the UN to become the agency for achieving world peace  as several dozen ongoing conflicts continue to rage around the globe  A 2005 RAND Corp study found the UN to be successful in two out of three peacekeeping efforts  It compared UN nation building efforts to those of the United States  and found that seven out of eight UN cases are at peace  as compared with four out of eight US cases at peace  34  Also in 2005  the Human Security Report documented a decline in the number of wars  genocides and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War  and presented evidence  albeit circumstantial  that international activism mostly spearheaded by the UN has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict since the end of the Cold War  35  Situations where the UN has not only acted to keep the peace but also occasionally intervened include the Korean War  1950 1953   and the authorization of intervention in Iraq after the Persian Gulf War in 1990  The UN has also drawn criticism for perceived failures  In many cases  member states have shown reluctance to achieve or enforce Security Council resolutions  an issue that stems from the UN s intergovernmental nature seen by some as simply an association of 193 member states who must reach consensus  not an independent organization  Disagreements in the Security Council about military action and intervention are seen as having failed to prevent the 1994 Rwandan Genocide  36  failed to provide humanitarian aid and intervene in the Second Congo War  failed to intervene in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre and protect a refugee haven by authorizing peacekeepers to use force  failure to deliver food to starving people in Somalia  failure to implement provisions of Security Council resolutions related to the Israeli Palestinian conflict  and continuing failure to prevent genocide or provide assistance in Darfur  UN peacekeepers have also been accused of child rape  sexual abuse or soliciting prostitutes during various peacekeeping missions  starting in 2003  in the Congo  37 Haiti  38  39 Liberia  40 Sudan and what is now South Sudan  41 Burundi and C te d Ivoire  42  In 2004  former Israeli ambassador to the UN Dore Gold criticized what it called the organization s moral relativism in the face of  and occasional support of  43 genocide and terrorism that occurred between the moral clarity of its founding period and the present day  Gold specifically mentions Yasser Arafat s 1988 invitation to address the General Assembly as a low point in the UN s history  44  In addition to peacekeeping  the UN is also active in encouraging disarmament  Regulation of armaments was included in the writing of the United Nations Charter in 1945 and was envisioned as a way of limiting the use of human and economic resources for the creation of them  45  However  the advent of nuclear weapons came only weeks after the signing of the charter and immediately halted concepts of arms limitation and disarmament  resulting in the first resolution of the first ever General Assembly meeting calling for specific proposals for  the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and of all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction   46  The principal forums for disarmament issues are the General Assembly First Committee  the UN Disarmament Commission  and the Conference on Disarmament  and considerations have been made of the merits of a ban on testing nuclear weapons  outer space arms control  the banning of chemical weapons and land mines  nuclear and conventional disarmament  nuclear weapon free zones  the reduction of military budgets  and measures to strengthen international security  The UN is one of the official supporters of the World Security Forum  a major international conference on the effects of global catastrophes and disasters  which took place in the United Arab Emirates in October 2008  Human rights and humanitarian assistance Eleanor Roosevelt with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1949 The pursuit of human rights was a central reason for creating the UN  World War II atrocities and genocide led to a ready consensus that the new organization must work to prevent any similar tragedies in the future  An early objective was creating a legal framework for considering and acting on complaints about human rights violations  The UN Charter obliges all member nations to promote  universal respect for  and observance of  human rights  and to take  joint and separate action  to that end  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights  though not legally binding  was adopted by the General Assembly in 1948 as a common standard of achievement for all  The Assembly regularly takes up human rights issues  The UN and its agencies are central in upholding and implementing the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  A case in point is support by the UN for countries in transition to democracy  Technical assistance in providing free and fair elections  improving judicial structures  drafting constitutions  training human rights officials  and transforming armed movements into political parties have contributed significantly to democratization worldwide  The UN has helped run elections in countries with little or no democratic history  including recently in Afghanistan and East Timor  The UN is also a forum to support the right of women to participate fully in the political  economic  and social life of their countries  The UN contributes to raising consciousness of the concept of human rights through its covenants and its attention to specific abuses through its General Assembly  Security Council resolutions  or International Court of Justice rulings  The purpose of the United Nations Human Rights Council  established in 2006  47  is to address human rights violations  The Council is the successor to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights  which was often criticized for the high profile positions it gave to member states that did not guarantee the human rights of their own citizens  48  The council has 47 members distributed by region  which each serve three year terms  and may not serve three consecutive terms  49  A candidate to the body must be approved by a majority of the General Assembly  In addition  the council has strict rules for membership  including a universal human rights review  While some members with questionable human rights records have been elected  it is fewer than before with the increased focus on each member state s human rights record  50  The rights of some 370 million indigenous peoples around the world are also a focus for the UN  with a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples being approved by the General Assembly in 2007  51  The declaration outlines the individual and collective rights to culture  language  education  identity  employment and health  thereby addressing post colonial issues that had confronted indigenous peoples for centuries  The declaration aims to maintain  strengthen and encourage the growth of indigenous institutions  cultures and traditions  It also prohibits discrimination against indigenous peoples and promotes their active participation in matters that concern their past  present and future  51  The United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues is the UN s central coordinating body for matters relating to the concerns and rights of the world s indigenous peoples  The forum is an advisory body within the framework of the United Nations System that reports to the UN s Economic and Social Council  In conjunction with other organizations such as the Red Cross  the UN provides food  drinking water  shelter and other humanitarian services to populaces suffering from famine  displaced by war  or afflicted by other disasters  Major humanitarian branches of the UN are the World Food Programme  which helps feed more than 100 million people a year in 80 countries   the office of the High Commissioner for Refugees with projects in over 116 countries  as well as peacekeeping projects in over 24 countries  Social and economic development Millennium Development Goals eradicate extreme poverty and hunger  achieve universal primary education  promote gender equality and empower women  reduce child mortality  improve maternal health  combat HIV AIDS  malaria  and other diseases  ensure environmental sustainability  and develop a global partnership for development  The UN is involved in supporting development  e g  by the formulation of the Millennium Development Goals  The UN Development Programme  UNDP  is the largest multilateral source of grant technical assistance in the world  Organizations like the World Health Organization  WHO   UNAIDS  and The Global Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria are leading institutions in the battle against diseases around the world  especially in poor countries  The UN Population Fund is a major provider of reproductive services  32 UN agencies performing tasks on development are coordinating their efforts through the United Nations Development Group or UNDG  52  The UN also promotes human development through some related agencies  particularly the UNDP  53  The World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund  IMF   for example  are independent  specialized agencies and observers within the UN framework  according to a 1947 agreement  They were initially formed as separate from the UN through the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1944  54  The UNDP annually publishes the Human Development Index  HDI   a comparative measure ranking countries by poverty  literacy  education  life expectancy  and other factors  55  The Millennium Development Goals  declared in the United Nations Millennium Declaration  signed in September 2000  are eight goals that all of the then 192 United Nations member states have agreed to try to achieve by the year 2015  56  Mandates See also  Category United Nations Security Council mandates From time to time  the different bodies of the United Nations pass resolutions that contain operating paragraphs that begin with the words  requests    calls upon   or  encourages   which the Secretary General interprets as a mandate to set up a temporary organization or do something  These mandates can be as little as researching and publishing a written report  or mounting a full scale peacekeeping operation  usually the exclusive domain of the Security Council   Although the specialized institutions  such as the WHO  were originally set up by this means  they are not the same as mandates because they are permanent organizations that exist independently of the UN with their own membership structure  One could say that original mandate was simply to cover the process of setting up the institution  and has therefore long expired  Most mandates expire after a limited period and require renewal from the body  which set them up  One of the outcomes of the 2005 World Summit was a mandate  labelled id 17171  for the Secretary General to  review all mandates older than five years originating from resolutions of the General Assembly and other organs   To facilitate this review and to finally bring coherence to the organization  the Secretariat has produced an on line registry of mandates to draw together the reports relating to each one and create an overall picture  57  Greening the Blue In 2007  On 5 June World Environment Day 2007  Secretary General Ban Ki moon made public his ambition to make the United Nations more efficient in its operations   I would like to see our renovated Headquarters complex eventually become a globally acclaimed model of efficient use of energy and resources  Beyond New York  the initiative should include the other United Nations headquarters and offices around the globe   The UN s progress towards achieving this goal is communicated through the initiative Greening the Blue  see external links below   Other Over the lifetime of the UN  over 80 colonies have attained independence  58  The General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in 1960 with no votes against but abstentions from all major colonial powers  Through the UN Committee on Decolonization  59  created in 1962  the UN has focused considerable attention on decolonization  It has also supported the new states that have arisen as a result of self determination initiatives  The committee has overseen the decolonization of every country larger than 20 000 km  and removed them from the United Nations list of Non Self Governing Territories  besides Western Sahara  a country larger than the UK only relinquished by Spain in 1975  The UN declares and coordinates international observances  periods of time to observe some issue of international interest or concern  Using the symbolism of the UN  a specially designed logo for the year  and the infrastructure of the United Nations System  various days and years have become catalysts to advancing key issues of concern on a global scale  For example  World Tuberculosis Day  Earth Day and International Year of Deserts and Desertification  Funding Top 10 donators to the UN budget  2011 60  Member state Contribution   of UN budget   USA 22 000   Japan 12 530   Germany 8 018   United Kingdom 6 604   France 6 123   Italy 4 999   Canada 3 207   China 3 189   Spain 3 177   Mexico 2 356  Other member states 27 797  The UN is financed from assessed and voluntary contributions from member states  The General Assembly approves the regular budget and determines the assessment for each member  This is broadly based on the relative capacity of each country to pay  as measured by their gross national income  GNI   with adjustments for external debt and low per capita income  61  The Assembly has established the principle that the UN should not be overly dependent on any one member to finance its operations  Thus  there is a  ceiling  rate  setting the maximum amount any member is assessed for the regular budget  In December 2000  the Assembly revised the scale of assessments to reflect current global circumstances  As part of that revision  the regular budget ceiling was reduced from 25  to 22   For the least developed countries  LDCs   a ceiling rate of 0 01  is applied  61  In addition to the ceiling rates  the minimum amount assessed to any member nation  or  floor  rate  is set at 0 001  of the UN budget  Refer to the table for major contributors  A large share of UN expenditures addresses the core UN mission of peace and security  The peacekeeping budget for the 2005 2006 fiscal year was approximately US 5 billion   2 5 billion  compared to approximately US 1 5 billion   995 million for the UN core budget over the same period   with some 70 000 troops deployed in 17 missions around the world  62  UN peace operations are funded by assessments  using a formula derived from the regular funding scale  but including a weighted surcharge for the five permanent Security Council members  who must approve all peacekeeping operations  This surcharge serves to offset discounted peacekeeping assessment rates for less developed countries  As of 1 January 2011  the top 10 providers of assessed financial contributions to United Nations peacekeeping operations were  the United States  Japan  the United Kingdom  Germany  France  Italy  China  Canada  Spain and the Republic of Korea  63  Special UN programmes not included in the regular budget  such as UNICEF  the WFP and UNDP  are financed by voluntary contributions from other member governments  Most of this is financial contributions  but some is in the form of agricultural commodities donated for afflicted populations  Since their funding is voluntary  many of these agencies suffer severe shortages during economic recessions  In July 2009  the World Food Programme reported that it has been forced to cut services because of insufficient funding  64  It has received barely a quarter of the total it needed for the 09 10 financial year  Personnel policy The UN and its agencies are immune to the laws of the countries where they operate  safeguarding UN s impartiality with regard to the host and member countries  65  Despite their independence in matters of human resources policy  the UN and its agencies voluntarily apply the laws of member states regarding same sex marriages  allowing decisions about the status of employees in a same sex partnership to be based on nationality  The UN and its agencies recognize same sex marriages only if the employees are citizens of countries that recognize the marriage  This practice is not specific to the recognition of same sex marriage but reflects a common practice of the UN for a number of human resources matters  It has to be noted though that some agencies provide limited benefits to domestic partners of their staff and that some agencies do not recognise same sex marriage or domestic partnership of their staff  citation needed  Reform Main article  Reform of the United Nations In 2005  then Secretary General Kofi Annan published his report In Larger Freedom  a proposal for reform of the UN  Since its founding  there have been many calls for reform of the United Nations  although little consensus on how to do so  Some want the UN to play a greater or more effective role in world affairs  while others want its role reduced to humanitarian work  66  There have also been numerous calls for the UN Security Council s membership to be increased  for different ways of electing the UN s Secretary General  and for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly  The UN has also been accused of bureaucratic inefficiency and waste  During the 1990s  the United States withheld dues citing inefficiency  and only started repayment on the condition that a major reforms initiative was introduced  In 1994  the Office of Internal Oversight Services  OIOS  was established by the General Assembly to serve as an efficiency watchdog  67  An official reform programme was begun by Kofi Annan in 1997  Reforms mentioned include changing the permanent membership of the Security Council  which currently reflects the power relations of 1945   making the bureaucracy more transparent  accountable and efficient  making the UN more democratic  and imposing an international tariff on arms manufacturers worldwide  citation needed  In September 2005  the UN convened a World Summit that brought together the heads of most member states  calling the summit  a once in a generation opportunity to take bold decisions in the areas of development  security  human rights and reform of the United Nations   68  Kofi Annan had proposed that the summit agree on a global  grand bargain  to reform the UN  renewing the organization s focus on peace  security  human rights and development  and to make it better equipped at facing 21st century issues  The World Summit Outcome Document delineated the conclusions of the meeting  including  the creation of a Peacebuilding Commission  to help countries emerging from conflict  a Human Rights Council and a democracy fund  a clear and unambiguous condemnation of terrorism  in all its forms and manifestations   agreements to devote more resources to the Office of Internal Oversight Services  agreements to spend billions more on achieving the Millennium Development Goals  the dissolution of the Trusteeship Council  because of the completion of its mission  and  the agreement that individual states  with the assistance of the international community  have the  responsibility to protect  populations from genocide  war crimes  ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity  with the understanding that the international community is prepared to act  collectively  in a  timely and decisive manner  to protect vulnerable civilians should a state  manifestly fail  in fulfilling its responsibility  69  The Office of Internal Oversight Services is being restructured to better define its scope and mandate  and will receive more resources  In addition  to improve the oversight and auditing capabilities of the General Assembly  an Independent Audit Advisory Committee  IAAC  is being created  In June 2007  the Fifth Committee created a draft resolution for the terms of reference of this committee  70  71  An ethics office was established in 2006  responsible for administering new financial disclosure and whistleblower protection policies  Working with the OIOS  the ethics office also plans to implement a policy to avoid fraud and corruption  72  The Secretariat is in the process of reviewing all UN mandates that are more than five years old  The review is intended to determine which duplicative or unnecessary programmes should be eliminated  Not all member states agree on which of the over 7000 mandates should be reviewed  The dispute centres on whether mandates that have been renewed should be examined  73  Indeed  the obstacles identified   in particular  the lack of information on the resource implications of each mandate   constituted sufficient justification for the General Assembly to discontinue the mandate review in September 2008  In the meantime  the General Assembly launched a number of new loosely related reform initiatives in April 2007  covering international environmental governance   Delivering as One  at the country level to enhance the consolidation of UN programme activities and a unified gender organization  Whereas little was achieved on the first two issues  the General Assembly approved in September 2010 the establishment of  UN Women  as the new UN organization for gender equality and the empowerment of women  UN Women was established by unifying the resources and mandates of four small entities for greater impact and its first head is Ms
