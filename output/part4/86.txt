Lollerkeet 09 13  22 May 2007  UTC  That is a great question  I think I chose good vs  bad instead of heroes vs  villains to allow for people like  Aunt May  and  Uncle Ben  who are good people  but not necessarily  heroes   It was a decision which I didn t think was better or worse than any other option at the time         Jamie 16 02  22 May 2007  UTC  Where can I find transcripts of comics

most popular Wikia wikis that use a large number of DPL calls  and as DPL queries can sometimes pose quit a load on the servers  being careful with the usage of DPL can help improve the general user experience at Wikia  One of the most simple ways to reduce the demand of DPL on the servers is to enable caching of the results  The more often a page with DPL calls get viewed  the greater the effect caching has  And so on a popular wiki such as this one  enabling caching is likely to help reduce the server load quite a bit  Unfortunately there is a downside  caching means the results won t immediately update when information on the wiki changes  Sometimes the information can be out of sync by several hours  If you are worried about technical accuracy  you can place a note warning the visitors  new changes may not be updated immediately   For mission critical usages of DPL that are time sensitive such that any delay is unacceptable  enabling caching wouldn t be a good idea  I ll drop by again later with more tips on how to improve server performance via optimizing DPL usage  If you have any questions  concerns  or think it s a good idea but need help implementing the change  feel free to discuss here  If you need a fast response from me  please ping me on my talk page  but still keep the main discussion here  so everything is in one place   Thanks   you can also check out more tips here    User PanSola talk history  21 58  24 April 2008  UTC  I think that most of the time  our DPL use can be cached without problem  In fact  I can t think of a spot where caching would cause a problem  How do we implement this    Nathan Elliott  Peteparker   Earth 1218   talk   contribs   email  16 55  27 April 2008  UTC  Heya  glad to know the above method is applicable here  To enable caching  just make sure to add this parameter  allowcachedresults true in the DPL call  Official documentation on it is at   DPL parameters  Other parameters allowcachedresults  Another thing to consider with DPL s  is  exactly how dynamic  is the list  If you have a page where the list only changes a tiny bit every other month  and it s a heavily visited page  then perhaps considering maintaining the list manually can reduce server load even further than enabling DPL cache  If it s a heavily utilized page by many people  then there s less fear of the page being out of date if maintained manually  Conversely  if it s a lightly visited page  then the benefits gained from doing a manual list is smaller  and with less people keeping an eye on the page it might not be updated as quickly  So it s up to you guys to decide which lists might be worth maintained manually  and with which pages templates the benefits of the dynamic nature of the list is greater  I ll drop by again sometime later again to check if you need help  and offer another tip  don t want to overwhelm you all at once d      Let me know if you have any questions   User PanSola talk history  17 19  5

test Edit Good morning  I m here to tell you about a new feature we re testing out on your wiki   Special WikiaStats  For every wiki at Wikia  we generate statistics that track the number of new editors  the number of articles  and various other information important to the life cycle of a wiki  These stats are much more detailed than the in built MediaWiki statistics page found at Special Statistics  As Wikia has grown we have tried to improve our statistics package to our users more robust data  As part of our latest update  each wiki will receive a special page where any logged in user can view detailed statistical information about their wiki  In addition  a number of the statistics have had their methods of calculation updated to be more accurate  We hope this will aid users in deciding where to focus their efforts  The new Wikia statistics pages can be found at Special WikiaStats on this wiki   Previously the information could be found on wikistats wikia com   In addition  there will be a central WikiaStats page which allows you to look up any wiki s stats  though this is not yet live  You can find out more about the new stats page at Help WikiaStats on Wikia Help  We are planning to release this to the rest of Wikia next week  In the meantime  we would love to get your feedback on the new stats page   where it s not clear  numbers that don t look accurate  or suggestions for improvement  You can leave feedback here  but it would help us keep everything organised if most of the feedback was left on this Central Wikia forum thread  Thanks  I would have posted this on the forums  but I can t register  gives me an error  Kirkburn  talk  17 05  11 September 2008  UTC  In the News Edit Maybe this could be changed to   say   The Daily Bugle  with the Bugle logo  Roygbiv666 16 28  8 November 2008  UTC  I like the idea  I think this one has to get the stamp of approval from Jamie since this is his baby and there might be  legal  copyright issues on the name   doubt it  but some weird stuff has been copyrighted and trademarked before so I never take any chances  Definitely think it should change if there are no outside issues with that name though  Good call     M1shawhan 16 40  8 November 2008  UTC  Hope not  as this entire site consists of trademark copyright material  I made the DC  In the News  into  The Daily Planet   naturally

needs some big changes  I mean  you ve either got stuff that shouldn t be there  or so little it s pathetic  I mean  just about every character has a  Powers and Abilities  section  even normal  non super hero characters  Guys  we already know they re not super heroes  We already know they don t have any special abilities  It s just a whole lot of annoying redundance  And it seems that you ve made it so that if someone hasn t put in info about the plot cast  it automatically says it s unknown  even when you remove the plot cast      My advice is to just make it so you have to do it manually  so you don t have even more redundance  Heck  it even says on the pages of some movies from like  50 years ago that the plot cast is unknown    IT IS KNOWN  IT S JUST THAT NOBODY S PUT ANYTHING IN     This wiki needs a lot of work  A lot of stuff is just plain ANNOYING  Iron Hammer 19 43  1 May 2009  UTC  Thanks for the suggestions  Creative criticism is always nice to hear  We re

Wiki reminds me of my father  I hated my father  What with Joker quips aside  I d like to introduce myself and who I represent  My name is Thomas Rattim  and I represent the wiki that is called Arkhampedia  Many people ask me about what sort of education I took to be such a cruel  humor obsessed man as I am today  which entitles me to the rank of administrator on said wiki  Well  it was all down to my education  yes  When that failed  I became an Arkhampedia administrator  Someone spin me a beer  now  I need to whet my voice for what I m about to say  None coming  Well  alright then  So I ll continue with my story  So  yes  I m an administrator or  Cell Keeper  over on Arkhampedia  Yes  it s named after Arkham Asylum  Now  we re a Wiki on all comics  similar to this wiki here   Although you re more focused on Batman  There s a big  big difference  however  We re a humor wiki  We like breaking things  I mean    making things humorous  Yeah  That s us  There are currently five administrators on our wiki  three bureaucrats and two administrators  I m not a bureaucrat  no  In terms of administrators  we have El Geeko Supremo  Bureaucrat too  Nina  bureaucrat   Texan Sysop  bureaucrat too   and a crazed Wookiee  Oh  and me  The half Russian half British full Commie full evil bastard  That s us  Now  our Wiki s have a lot of things in common  things I really don t think we need to go into in detail  Now  we re a small outfit  And there s lots of room for aggressive expansion  No  we re not going to have tryouts  We re not picky on who we re going to get as inmates     We  however  hope to expand  With all our administrators  with the exception of me and Nina  having been administrators or formerly been administrators on the Star Wars humor wiki Darthipedia  we re looking to expand to that sort of level or more  And we need users for this  eh  Yep  Well  as we ve got a lot in common  we thought you ought to be aware of us being there and all  and we d welcome any sort of cross wiki editing or relations between us  If you have any queries at all  feel free to ask me here  Other admins will probably drop in and see too  Cheers       Thomas Rattim  talk  Why are there so many universes  Edit HEY     Can anyone tell me why there are som many damn universes    There should be only one huge  great  big universe  I know that one universe is for a comic and another is for a different comic or a tv show  but cant the writers just find some way to fit it in with the other timelines and whatnot  The preceding unsigned comment was added by Darth tom  talk   contribs   It is maddening  isn t it  When writers want to write about the characters they love  but want to tweak their histories powers etc  they put them in an alternate universe  Why  Who knows    Welcome to the madness  Artful Dodger 12 42  24 May 2009  UTC  You gotta figure that these characters have been around for about 50 years now  and fitting all of their adventures into one big timeline together would largely be impossible  Then there are stories which take place in the future  and the past  but still feature the same characters  I remember one month where I noticed that Wolverine was in New York  China  Mexico  the Future  and Space all at the same time  And that was the same guy  from Earth 616  Using different universes allows the writers to do whatever they want with the character  without having to worry about what has happened in the past  or why they act or look so different all of the sudden   It s easier than trying to figure out the whole one big timeline thing

Comic Reviews Edit Hi  I don t really know if I should be discussing this here  I m somewhat new  but I was wondering if we should add reviews to comic books  I mean they do get reviewed right  So why not  I know IGN does comic book reviews  AHB 05 59  6 July 2009  UTC  Great suggestion  We actually do have a review system in place around here  but it s easily overlooked  Under the  See Also  section on each comic page  the fist link says   Write your own review of this comic   So all you have to do for any given comic is click there  and review it at your leisure  We advertised this feature for a couple weeks when it first came out  but not a lot of people got into it  It s still there  waiting to be used       Nathan  Peteparker   Earth 1218   talk   contribs   email  18 09  6 July 2009  UTC  Maybe it should be advertised on the Main Page again  Is it available on DCDP  19 05  6 July 2009  UTC  The Main Page has to stay as neat and trim as we possibly can make it  in order to utilize Google s ranking system for the site  What we might be able to do is have a link on there somewhere that points to a FAQ section  where it might talk about this sort of thing  I m not sure I ever installed it on the DC Side  Lemme know if it s something you re cravin       Nathan  Peteparker   Earth 1218   talk   contribs   email  04 52  7 July 2009  UTC  Page TitlesEdit Shouldn t MOST page titles be the hero villian s curent  or  if deceased  former alias  I think that s what page titles should be like  What do you think   The Rum Runner 21 23  11 July 2009  UTC  Actually  there has been a ton of debate over that exact issue  The main problem is that there are more people with the same alias than the same real full name  Take Henry Pym  for instance  He s now Wasp  but Janet van Dyne was Wasp when she died  Who would get that spot  There s a ton more issues than that one  but they all lead to the same conclusion  the full real name of the character is the most unique way to name the page  which ensures that everyone who goes to that page knows which version of which character they re reading about  Join us on the forums  That s where this discussion has been taking place for all this time       Nathan  Peteparker   Earth 1218   talk   contribs   email  23 51  11 July 2009  UTC  90 s Marvel Cartoons Universe Designations Edit  According to Marvel Database and several other sites  all animated series and movies are within the Multiverse  For example  MD lists Spider Man as Earth 194111  However  there are some problems at least with MD s listing  It lists Spider Man and Spider Carnage as both being from Earth 194111 despite the series clearly stating they were from alternate universes  It also lists X Men as being Earth 92131 and Iron Man as being Earth 569386 despite obvious attempts to put them in the same universe as Spider Man    this was quoted from someone in the Marvel Animated Universe wikia  I d like to ask if your stance on the universe designations of the 90 s Marvel cartoons are officially approved by Marvel itself Pelletboy 05 55  18 July 2009  UTC  The Infamous Vol 5 Added by Peteparker Well  we go by official Marvel Publications  such as the Official Handbooks to the Marvel Universe  In the recently released hardback versions  Volumes 2 5 list all the official universe numbers known at the time of publication  At the end of the list  in the back of Volume 5   page pictured on the right   there is a blurb that mentions a link on the internet that contains the full  updated list  For updates and the unabridged list  see http   www marvunapp com master earthteaz htm   Volume 5 So we go by that list when citing our universe numbers  MD s listing for Spider Carnage has been fixed according to that list  and he s now of universe Earth 98311  Marvel Animated takes the stance that all the animated series of that time were incorporated into one big universe  Officially  according to Volume 5  this is not Marvel s stance  Even though the characters from these series look remarkably similar  and are even voiced by the same actors in most cases  these facts obviously do not mean they are automatically from the same universe    Nathan  Peteparker   Earth 1218   talk   contribs   email  18 31  19 July 2009  UTC  Is the link authorized by Marvel itself  It seems to be made by just a fan  And one of you said   Marvel Animated takes the stance that all the animated series of that time were incorporated into one big universe  Officially  according to Volume 5  this is not Marvel s stance   Isn t Marvel and Marvel Animated one company and thus have the same stance  So which among the 90 s cartoons share the same universe  Are are all of them in separate universes  Also  are the Marvel movies part of the Marvel Multiverse are they mentioned in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  When is the latest issue of the OHOTMU released  They say it was as long ago as 1988  Is this true  Pelletboy 05 50  20 July 2009  UTC  Yes  the link is authorized by Marvel Comics  It appears in an official Marvel publication  and in the Handbooks for the Marvel Universe  no less  If anything is  official   it s the handbooks  When I was referring to  Marvel Animated   I was referring to the wiki  not the company  As far as we ve seen  all of the cartoons occur in separate universes  The only two major media productions which actually occur in the same universe were the Iron Man and Incredible Hulk live action films  This universe is planned on being expanded further with the release of Thor and Captain America supposedly happening in the same one  eventually leading to an Avengers movie  all in the same line of movies  So that brings us to your next question  yes the Marvel Movies are part of the Multiverse  happening in their own universes  Another interesting one  and a bit obvious  is that X Men Origins  Wolverine takes place in the same universe as the previous three X Men universes  Official Handbooks are still being produced  with sim b 7 the latest of the Hardback versions  which have been revised and expanded  being released this month  You ll also notice that the main editor writer for these versions is also the author of that site that the end of Volume 5 points to  making their universe listing even more official    Nathan  Peteparker   Earth 1218   talk   contribs   email  14 44  20 July 2009  UTC  You said  the Marvel Movies are part of the Multiverse  happening in their own universes   Did Marvel officially clarify this and take this stance  If so  what earth number is the Spiderman movie set in  Are there listings for this in the OHOTMU  Also  in the OHOTMU  it states that the omniverse includes  It includes every single literary  television show  movie  urban legend  universe  realm  etc  ever  It includes everyone from Popeye to Rocky Balboa to Ronald Reagan to Romeo and Juliet to Luke Skywalker to Snoopy to Jay and Silent Bob  Mickey Mouse  etc   Do the other companies who produced these characters also agree with this or not  If not  then is that stil Marvel s stand on the omniverse since the other companies don t acknowledge the link between the universes and may even create situations within their respective universes that contradict the existence of an omniverse  The Cthulhu Mythos also disagrees with the existence of the One Above All 0n the Marvel Universe in their revelation of a dark ultimate reality  How do you reconcile all of this  In your character bios on Marvel com  the One Above All has his universe set in the omniverse  Does this mean he is also present  and perhaps even the head  of the other universes  If so  would other companies  universes like DC and Image approve of this  You state that the omniverse includes every story in literature  isn t this a bit unrealistic if put in action because for example  you would have a Romeo and Juliet story that exists in the Marvel Universe in that it is part of their literature  Shakespeare really wrote it as the Marvel Universe shares this reality with our own reality  But then it  Romeo and Juliet  also exists in another universe part of the Omniverse since all literature is part of the Omniverse  Wouldn t it be very unrealistic to have a real Romeo and Juliet universe that the Marvel Universe also has as part of its literature  Would this mean that all the writers and contributors to the literature of the Marvel Universe also be telling about a story that is existing elsewhere somewhere in the multiverse  Then there is no such thing as fiction in the Marvel Universe if this is the case  am I right  With this  then all of the stories within the Marvel Universe are real  Are there fictional superhoeroes and comic books in the Marvel Universe  In short  does this mean that there is a real romeo and juliet existing somewhere in the Marvel omniverse as well as a fictional account of it created by Shakespeare  Is there such a thing as fictional literature in the MU then  And it is said that the Marvel Max and some Marvel Knights titles are out of continuity  Does this mean they are not part of the Marvel omniverse altogether or do they exist within the omniverse in a separate universe  How do you know if a Marvel Knights title is out of continuity or not  Don t they have an indicator in the cover   Pelletboy 08 42  21 July 2009  UTC  Yes  Marvel has officially endorsed the movies as having their own universe designations  and printed them in Volumes 2 through 5 of the hardback OHOTMUs  The Spider Man movies thus far take place in Earth 96283  Other companies have their own stances on the Omniverse  much like different scientists have different theories as to how our universe fits into the whole of creation  As this is a Marvel site  we only focus on the Marvel multiverse  and not the rest of the Omniverse happening outside the collective of Marvel Universes  Marvel still stands behind their multiverse setup as their way for explaining how different stories happen with similar characters at the same time  The One Above All is wholly a Marvel creation  and is mostly unexplained  Reconciling the differences between Marvel s stance on the omniverse and the stance of other intellectual properties is not something we re attempting to achieve here  We re just trying to document all of Marvel s creations  I think you may be confused  The Marvel Database is in no way officially affiliated with Marvel com  We are a fan owned and operated site  in no way endorsed by Marvel Comics Inc  Anything you see on Marvel com is not ours  so we can t speak for discrepancies found there  Now you re getting into the nitty gritty of the overall idea of the Omniverse  which is not a theory we ve made up here  but follow according to the Handbooks and the marvunapp com site  since it s endorsed by Marvel through the handbooks   If you have problems or issues with the Omniverse theory  they are best taken up by either the writers of the Handbooks or the writers of marvunapp  We don t make it up  we just follow it  Movies  tv shows  books and comics have all been seen in Marvel Comics  According to the Omniverse theory  they all depict alternate realities found somewhere in the Omniverse  The  fictional account  of Romeo and Juliet  for example is not actually a fictional account  but a glimpse into the happenings of Romeo and Juliet s reality  transcribed by William Shakespeare  Since Shakespeare existed in many realities  this happened in many realities  Marvel Max and Marvel Knights titles are tricky  Most of them take place on Earth 616  but there are a handful that don t  such as Supreme Power and Strange  We mostly leave it up to the handbooks to tell us which are and aren t happening in Earth 616  and there is no indication on the covers if a story from a series does not take place in the 616 reality    Nathan  Peteparker   Earth 1218   talk   contribs   email  18 38  21 July 2009  UTC  Do you know

character starred in and the years that series ran  You name their first appearance and have a page for all their appearances but I think that it will be far easier to follow a character if there was a place where all the books they starred in was available  The preceding unsigned comment was added by Vincent1875  talk   contribs   So you re saying instead of having each individual book listed in the character s appearance category  we d just list the Volume of the books they appeared in  and the years the volume ran  I tried making something like this for Machine Man s Appearances  Is this what you were envisioning    Nathan  Peteparker   Earth 1218   talk   contribs   email  15 20  April 7  2010  UTC  Not quite  I m not really talking about messing with the character appearance page  I m thinking of putting something on the characters actual page that would list only the series they were starring in  Like for Hulk you could put  Tales to Astonish Vol 1  60 101 1964 1968    If you re trying to look up a guy who guest appears in a lot of stuff the character appearance page will be annoying to navigate in trying to find their books  After actually putting series they starred in on their own page it seems likely to clean up the appearance pages of popular characters as well because you won t have hundreds of books they starred in cluttering it up   Vincent1875 21 59  April 7

scary  Chronological appearances sorted by publication date    that s    just    my    mind    blown       honestly  love it  Is that a huge amount of work to do that for all appearance pages  It looks like a great tool for trying to compile bios for less known characters    The Machine Man thing looked pretty cool  but it could probably get confusing  since clicking on one of the volumes will get you to the complete volume  not just the issues the character appeared in  now about the roll down thing  it s weird  I could have sworn that every alternate reality page had these roll down things  like Category Earth 1191 where you have the box with a   that rolls down  But they don t really seem to do anything  My idea was that the appearances could be sorted by books  where you d have such a roll down     that would then open up the individual appearances for every book  I think Vincent is only talkling about books where the characters were featured   edkaufman 00 24  April 8  2010  UTC  Ah  three years later  I get what Ed was talking about  Unfortunately  we don t have a lot of control over the roll down things  Basically  the only things that roll out  down  from those are sub categories within the categories  So we d have to make every single appearance for every single comic it s own category  and make all of the categories for a character each be in the character s appearance category  It would be pretty complicated       Nathan  Peteparker   Earth 1218   talk   contribs   email  04 07  September 3  2010  UTC  I ve included the chronological appearances part for all character appearance categories that have less than 500 appearances  We ll see how it affects the site  if at all  I ve also removed the Machine Man one  like you said  it s not the greatest situation  The roll down thing you mentioned has to do with categories with categories  or  sub categories   All of the Reality categories are sub categories of the main category  Category Realities  so they show up with that little plus  Clicking the plus is supposed to show you the sub categories within that specific category  but if there are none  it does nothing  I ve attempted to set these up  with Blink s Appearances as the template  but it gets pretty hairy pretty quickly  I m not sure we can actually get the individual comics to appear underneath when the plus is clicked      Nathan

referencing the list of archenemies  Wikipedia List of fictional archenemies The official Marvel comic book site has news mentions at times  but no actual list of who is the archenemy of who listed in their profiles  Is there a reference book published that list this information  or somewhere else it can be found  Dream Focus 15 53  May 31  2010  UTC  I think its mostly a matter of opinion  and it can vary over time  Some are obvious  Reed Richards has Dr  Doom   but even some obvious ones haven t always been true  Magneto became headmaster of Xaviers for a few years  and now he s joined up again   And even Dr  Doom is hardly Reed s nemesis  because he does not challenge Richard s fundamental beliefs  He s just a rival  I don t think any such list can possibly be made or remain relevant  Is Iron Man s nemesis still Mandarin   how relevant has Mandarin been in the last 10 years of Iron Man s history  Is he really an archenemy  Whose archenemy is Ultron  Hank Pym  The Avengers as a whole  The Vision  Magneto s relation to the X Men is probably the closest to a true archenemy at certain points  because there s actual philosophical opposition  Its not enough to oppose a hero  one must be the antithesis of that hero  Or possibly the US government to the X Men  since they ve sponsored the Sentinel program et al  Most heroes just don t have enough philosophy to have true polar opposites  Most heroes just have guys they fight frequently    Squirrelloid 16 34  May 31  2010  UTC  Arena of Tainted SoulsEdit How about battles between some of the characters and places like on

and win percentage  with individual breakdowns  like  Wolverine is 4 to 2 against Deadpool  7 to 12 against Sabretooth  and so forth  And since it s tied to the individual issues  everything is perfectly cited and referenced  Nothing could be simpler  PiranhaSister 21 12  November 13  2010  UTC  This is a good idea  but as of this moment  we would have to use DPL  which is a coding style to

subject I think itd be good if Moon Knight and Nick Fury had their own thumbnails on the main page too  they mightn t be as well known by the mainsteram as the others but have been intrinsic in a

noticing that on character pages  when a first  or sometimes last death  appearance is listed with a redirect  i e  Fantastic Four  1   the ENTIRE comic listed is shown in the infobox  BTW  I ve also found that if you type an appearence as  Fanatsic Four Vol 1 1 Fantasti Four  1   it corrects this problem    Spencerz 21 45  February 6  2011  UTC  That shouldn t be true  I checked on the issue and it s cleared up now  If you see more of this  check the comic s page  as we re converting those to the new appearance method  which has caused some of those to have errors on them  Thanks    Nathan

t match up anymore  I can t seem to edit or add any  Power grids have been a source of trouble on the Database  as many users would like to add their own numbers  rather than those found in official Marvel publications  In order to combat this continuing issue  we ve made the official Power Grids only editable by Administrators  Fan Based power grids can still be added to pages  for now   using the New Power Grid Template  This new template will automatically include official power grids on the page if they exist  If you know of an official power grid which needs to be added to the site

Marvel encyclopedia  and this is a Marvel property      Spencerz 21 50  February 13  2011  UTC  LOL  Not a stupid question  I would say yes  but I think we should treat it almost like a movie in format and templates  I don t think we need to setup a  Broadway Play  template       M1shawhan 00 27  February 14  2011  UTC  Something of note  There appears to be a hardcover novelization of the play  We ll have to add that as well    Spencerz 00 37  February 14  2011  UTC  2 Universes  Or 1  Edit So admins  or knowledgable folk  I need some opinion  We have X Men II  The Fall of the Mutants  whihc is an old video game we have assigned to Earth TRN002  And  we have X Men  Madness in Murderworld  another old video game that we have assigned to Earth TRN003  No personally  I believed that X Men II was just a stand alone game with an odd title choice  But I did some searching online  and I believe we may have a series on our hands  After comparing them side by side  I ve realized that they both were released on PC systems  they were released one year apart  and they were both developed  to some degree  by Paragon Studios  But nowhere have I seen it stated that they were related  So I ask you  what do you think  Should we combine them into a series  and a common TRN reality   Or should we leave them seperated and wait for Marvel s word  which may be a long wait  seeing as they were realeased in 1989 and 1990  and there has yet to be any word   Or do we do something else  I don t wanna just change anything myself  seeing as there ll be a large amount of page moving and change involved    Spencerz 00 00  February 19  2011  UTC  Marvel Zombies Edit Man could somebody please tell me how would Doctor Octopus 2099 look like if she got infected by the zombie virus  PLEASE

I follow the standard marvel timeline  earth 616  since i was 10  I inherited this passion from my dad and uncles  Just a little bit confused how Marvel writers explain that superheroes are not ageing like us  I mean  Peter Parker should be at least in his late fiftys for what I know  Is there anyone who can explain me why Superheroes doesn t ageing like it was supposed to be  I can t speak for all the comic heroes  but on the Marvel side  it s called Marvel Time  and we have a whole article explaining the situation  But basically  it comes down to the fact that readers want to relate to the characters  so the characters have to stay close to the same age as their readers  While it would be interesting for an issue or two  not many fans really want to read about Peter Parker living out his final days in a retirement home  Take Spider Girl Vol 1  for instance  This entire series is set in a future where everyone has aged  and the series is continually being cancelled and getting brought back  There are barely enough fans to keep it going    Nathan  Peteparker   Earth 1218   talk   contribs   email  07 52  May 20  2011  UTC  Background Edit The background of this wiki seems as

21  2011  UTC  Monet St  Croix Intelligence Edit How smart do you think M really is  Do you think her intelligence is greater or the same as Sage  Community Pages Edit Hello  I have been using this wiki on and off and am totally in love with the wonderful prose of the articles  which  almost  comes close to reading the comics themselves  but not quite  I can t help noticing a couple of things which are quite odd to me  Firstly  there are numerous typos around  ranging from simple typos to formatting errors  I just saw an internal link gone wrong   This is exacerbated by the fact that the articles are really really long  Ok let me be more specific  the correcting of the typo is hampered by the fact that the page headers are not sections themselves  meaning that I just cant press the  edit  button and correct it  I would have to scroll through meters of text  you ll be surprised at the length of some character biographies  and carefully search for the error in question  Secondly  a lack of consistency amongst articles  Article A may mention that persons B was involved in event C together with persons D  but upon visiting persons D s page  there is no mention whatsoever  Also  across a few wikis I  regularly  visit  there is sort of a rule that the first mention gets a link  I am wondering if there is such a rule here  Before I continue  I know that it may seem that I am one of those people who  just come in and start criticising without knowing anything   but I do hope that all of what I have to say is considered  and not met with anything from outright flaming  to the  polite putdown   Thirdly  headers  Okay  I m not sure what the proper term is  but im referring to those banner ad kind of things you see the moment you visit a  bad  article on wikipedia  indicating without having to press a show hide button  whether the article requires sourcing  cleanup  or contains spoilers  Lastly  the lack of  proper  community pages  a  forums  one has to proceed through a separate login to an external site in order to access the community forums  b  help pages  too many pages linking to wikipedean pages  Yes  I agree that this is a derivative of wikipedia  that specialises in this particular content  and thus follows certain wikipedean principles and regulations  but  Wikipedia is Wikipedia  with their long winded and overly elaborated guidelines  policies to the point it resembles legal jargon  I doubt most average people would like to spend time reading such things  Suggestions Organise a cleanup  easier said than done i know   or a massive manhunt to increase consistency  Organise  article to be improved day week month  where perhaps a major article or several minor ones are the focus of Improvement for a set amount of time  create some bots  if that is possible i am not familiar with such things  to correct typos  Create simplified guidelines and policy pages  derived from wikipedia  based on community consensus  that are specific to the needs of this wiki  like whether all instances of name  for example  should be linked  or the first mention or first mention per paragraph etc  Have a proper in wiki forum page  so that users can voice concerns  make requests etc without having to log in to an external website  thus removing a kind of  barriers to entry  on community interactions  Referring to how other wikis   other than wikipedia  do their stuff wouldnt hurt  im sure some of you people do visit other wikis  but im just guessing  Well i am just coming up with a couple of solutions off the top of my head  i am not insisting that you have to follow them  but perhaps discuss and build on them  I admit I am not entirely familiar with all policies  guidelines and even am not entirely familiar with performing edits on articles  I do wiki stuff on a really on off basis  really on off   I know people do these things on a volunteer basis  and for free to boot  and I do understand that everyone here has a life  work  family  etcetc  but please  do spend some time to consider what I have said and have a really nice day    Songjin 22 41  June 25  2011  UTC  Lot of issues  which is fine  Let me try and address them as best I can  1  Length of pages  Some characters just have a LOT of history  On certain characters we ve made use of  Expanded History  pages  see Peter Parker  Earth 1610   for instance  If users like this idea  we could certainly look at expanding it  but pages will  ultimately  have to be a certain size for certain characters due to the sheer number of lasting events  2  Typos  They happen  I know the length of some pages can make them a hassle to correct  but it s the price we pay for detail  3  Consistency  As far as what you ve said  part of that s because certain events just affect certain characters more  Maximum Carnage  for instance  played a far larger role in the life of Carnage than  say  Deathlok  Really  we wouldn t be able to improve this issue AND the length issue at the same time  It s either cut back on certain information  or have it all there  4  Headers  Those should serve a purpose  If you feel one doesn t  post on the talk page for that page  the newer comic pages always have a spoiler header in an effort to prevent people from being spoiled   5  Forums  That s really the only option  as far as forums go  though we ve tried forums on the Wiki itself before with  seemingly  mixed reaction  6  The Help Pages  You re right  Nothing else to it  It s a mess  and it s  somewhere  on my to do list  But there s a LOT that needs done  and it s just easy to let that keep until the staff can get to it  The policies and guidelines are actually my current  albeit stalled  project  Expect something to be done about them   as soon as I can find the time  7  Bots to correct typos  Given the number of characters with oddball names  I don t think it would be realistic  even if it was possible  I encourage anyone who s willing to do the work to do it themselves  I assure you the work is appreciated and not forgotten  8  In wiki forum Again  we had one  somewhere   We also have the chat  which can be accessed from almost any page and utilizes your Wikia info  You can also direct any comments concerns to the Administrators or post on individual talk pages to deal with issues on specific articles  9  Comment criticisms  We ALWAYS appreciate insightful looks into our site such as you ve presented here  The biggest issue we ll always have is a lack of manpower  and we encourage you and others like you to dig in and get your hands dirty  Change can only come about through our combined efforts  after all  None of us are machines and none of us can catch every problem  The more of us working towards the betterment of the site  the better the site s going to get  Again  love the post  and if you have anything else to add  please do so here or on my talk page  or join the forums  It s an extra login  but it s worth it     GrnMarvl14 02 16  June 26  2011  UTC  Wow  Thank you for the fast and thoroughly thorough reply  REALLY appreciate it  Ok I ll do a quick review of what you said  On points 1 and 2  I guess its time to get my hands dirty then    For point 3  what you say does make sense  but I am referring to instances like Hulkling  Wiccan  amp  Speed where even though all 3 were involved in the search for the Scarlet Witch  there are gaps in the biographies  Of course  the articles are super long so I guess its hard to maintain  which leads me to the next point on headers  There seems to be a lack of headers in general  and therefore  a lack of  perhaps  direction    as to what improvements the article requires  I think what wikipedia and a couple other wikis do is a pretty efficient method where the header is displayed prominently  clearly stating that the page needs to be cleaned up  sourced  expanded  or is undergoing a proposed deletion merge etc  Take a look here for a couple of examples because I cant seem to find a category page for templates and stuff like that  all I find are empty category pages   As for forums  could you elaborate on this  mixed reactions   I am rather curious as to why people would prefer an external site  compared to an in house  so to speak  community portal of sorts  because from what I see  there are several communities  even within the forums itself  As for the help pages  they require a community consensus for each policy  the current forum used is a mess to  troll  through  Do take a look here  I quite like how they have done it  as people dont  let their hair down  as compared to forum style of posting  thus making it easier to find information pertaining to the subject at hand  Perhaps  i should take what i have to say to the forums itself  since its weird to post on the talkpage for the main page  but in my defense  i did it because i couldn t find a proper place to post and was kind of unwilling to create yet another account for this and that   sigh  Again  I totally APPRECIATE the VERY thorough reply  Cheers  Songjin 10 28  June 26  2011  UTC  Always feel free to dig in  and if you have any questions on how to do certain things  feel free to ask one of the Administrators  including myself   We re always willing to help new users get things figured out  As for the Wiccan  Hulkling  and Speed inconsistencies  that like just boils down to people updating one and not the other  Though  so far  the event s had a far large impact on Wiccan than either of the others  As for the lack of headers  different pages need different things in different quantities  Not every page needs a header  since every page needs SOME improvement  no page is perfect  after all  and they re in a constant state of flux  It would be counter intuitive to have them on every page needing improvement since EVERY PAGE needs improvement   We largely use them for things like moves  deletion  and other things that need a decision and that we desire a community response on  As for the external forums  that s due to it being that way for a long time  and again  due to a less than successful shift to an on Wiki forum system  It s really just a tough thing to shift from one thing to another  especially when the forums have never been terribly active to begin with  despite our constant encouragement for people to head there    GrnMarvl14 17

  Professor Kilroy 11 41  August 1  2011  UTC  Howling Commandos Edit Why don t the Howling Commandos  ie  Dum Dum Dugan and Gabe Jones etc   age  I mean I get Fury with the Infinity Formula  but that s always perplexed me  Well  none of the characters ever really age in comics  Otherwise most of our classic heroes would be on Social Security  In Marvel s case  characters either come with their own anti aging clause  Fury s Infinity Formula  Wolverine s regeneration factor  Captain America s Super Soldier Serum  and being frozen in ice  etc   or  it s explained away by the sliding timescale Marvel uses  Not sure of the exact timeframes it uses  but think of it like this  A month may pass between issues for us  but in the comic s timeframe  it may have been only seconds that have passed between the final pannel of issue A and the opening pannel of issue B    Spencerz 13 52  October 12  2011  UTC  A number of the Howling Commandos  due to numerous exposures to Fury s Infinity Formula tainted blood have also experienced slowed aging  SOME of the Commandos HAVE aged  such as Pinkerton  and I believe Ralston   but those who have served with Fury beyond WWII  Dugan  Jones to a lesser degree  are still fairly young looking    GrnMarvl14 14 56  October 12  2011  UTC  Polls Edit Maybe it s time for a new poll or two on the main page  It s been 5 months since they changed    Spencerz
