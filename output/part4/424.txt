Realizing that the damage is extensive  Gaia sends five magic rings  four with the power to control an element of nature and one controlling the element of Heart  to five chosen youths across the globe  Kwame from Africa  Wheeler from North America  Linka from the Soviet Union  changed to Eastern Europe after the Soviet Union s collapse   Gi from Asia  and Ma Ti from South America  These five are dubbed the Planeteers and are tasked with defending the Earth from the greatest of disasters and making efforts to educate mankind to keep others from happening  Gaia uses her  Planet Vision  to discover where the most devastating destruction is occurring and sends the Planeteers to help solve the problem  The Planeteers use transportation  usually a flying machine called a Geo Cruiser  based on solar power to avoid causing pollution themselves  In situations that the Planeteers cannot resolve alone  they can combine their powers to summon Captain Planet  a magical entity who possesses all of their powers magnified  symbolizing the premise that the combined efforts of a team are stronger than its individual parts  Captain Planet only appears in his Captain Planet garb  These are not clothes but elements of the Earth that are integral to his composition  He is able to rearrange his molecular structure to transform himself into the various powers and elements of nature  Captain Planet s outfit does not represent a specific culture  citation needed  He has a grass green proto mullet  crystal skin  earthy brown eyes  a fire red chest  gloves  and boots  and a sun yellow globe insignia  In a manner similar to the mid 1950s 1986 incarnation of Superman  Captain Planet has superhuman powers  and seems to gain more proportionate to whatever the situation requires  Nevertheless  he is weakened by pollutants which sap his strength  from smog to nuclear radiation  in much the same manner that Superman is weakened by Kryptonite  Captain Planet s personality is also similar to that of the Silver Age version of Superman  always remaining friendly and upbeat in the darkest of situations  Like the Silver Age Superman  he also dislikes killing even the cruellest bad guys and has a strict sense of justice  such as when Captain Planet allowed himself to be jailed for a crime he did not commit   The Planeteers cannot use their individual powers while Captain Planet has been summoned  8  Despite his vulnerability to pollution  Captain Planet is a formidable and valiant hero  Once his work is done  Captain Planet returns to the Earth  restoring the Planeteers  powers  When he does this  Captain Planet reminds viewers of the message of the series with his catchphrase   The Power Is Yours    edit  Characters  edit  Captain Planet Captain Planet Publication information First appearance Captain Planet and the Planeteers  A Hero for Earth Greed Is The Word  Voiced by David Coburn In story information Team affiliations The Planeteers Abilities Weather and climate manipulation Ability to generate and control earth  fire  wind and water Near invincibilityTelepathyFlightSuper strengthSuper speed Captain Planet is the title character of the series  In the beginning of the series  Gaia assembles a modern day team of  Planeteers  from several nations  When the modern day Planeteers combine their powers to summon the elemental warrior  this incarnation takes on the appearance of a superhero  who takes on the superhero like name of  Captain Planet   Captain Planet displays a wry sense of humor and often uses puns while taunting the show s cast of villains  The Planeteers summon him when the need arises and when the crisis is too much for them to handle  When summoned  Captain Planet declares  By your powers combined  I am Captain Planet    After the crisis is dealt with  Captain Planet disappears  and restores the powers to the Planeteer s rings  His parting phrase is   The Power Is Yours   implying a duty and the ability of everyone to continue protecting the environment when he is gone  Captain Planet s abilities are never clearly defined within the show  allowing him to always have a way of defeating his enemy and solving the problem before him  He can shape shift and alter his structure to take on the properties of any element or material as well as transmuting other objects in a similar fashion  In various episodes he flies  has great strength  and displays telepathic empathic abilities  Captain Planet is weakened when he is in contact with pollutants  radiation  smog  etc  Like Gaia  he is bound to the physical realm of Earth  Although he is capable of flying into space  his powers and form begin to fade when he travels away from the planet  However  in one episode he is unable to  return to the Earth  completely because two of the Planeteers  and their rings  have been taken into space  leaving him unable to access his abilities associated with the other three elements   edit  Gaia Gaia  voiced by Whoopi Goldberg in 1990 1993  Margot Kidder in 1993 1995  is the spirit of the Earth  She is a modern rendition of the primordial Greek earth goddess  possessing an amalgamation of physical characteristics from all human races  Awaking from a century long slumber  and shocked with the increase in pollution of Earth that has sustained in such a short  by her standards  time  she summons the Planeteers to defend Earth and gives them their elemental rings  Gaia lives on Hope Island  an island with large crystals in the middle of an ocean  although its exact location is never revealed  She is omnipresent  she can appear in any time or place she wishes  and can communicate telepathically with anyone at any point in time  She is bound to Earth  and her health and well being are connected with the condition of the planet   edit  Planeteers The Planeteers  Clockwise from left top  Gi  Kwame  Linka  Ma Ti  and Wheeler  The Planeteers are summoned by Gaia to defend the world from pollution  criminals  and natural disasters  The five teenagers  each originating from a different region of the world and who together represent several major ethnic groups  are each given a ring which allows them to temporarily control one of the four classical elements   Earth  Fire  Wind  and Water   as well as a fifth element  Heart  which represents love and communication and enables telepathy and empathy  as well as potential mind control  This combination has been compared to the Wiccan pentacle  9  Pyle cites that the inspiration for the five Planeteers came from real people that she was affected by during the show s pre production in 1989  To summon Captain Planet  the Planeteers must activate their powers in a specific order  preceded by the phrase   Let our powers combine   after his appearance  the Planeteers would cheer   Go Planet   It can be noted that during the DiC series  the sequence of special effects preceding Captain Planet s appearance differed each and every time  citation needed  In the Hanna Barbera series  there were some creative ideas for Captain Planet s appearance when being summoned  citation needed  but most of the time  it consisted of flashes of lightning  along with sounds of thunder  Animation in the DiC series was inconsistent  showing some episodes as darker or brighter in color than others  and characters looking different from one episode to the next  and in some cases one segment  or even shot  to the next  The Planeteers  rings are  like Captain Planet himself  susceptible to weakening when in the presence of toxic waste and pollution to the point that they can no longer use their powers or summon Captain Planet  The five Planeteers are  Kwame  voiced by LeVar Burton   From Ghana  Africa  Kwame possesses the power of Earth  He has a soft spot for plant life  Growing up in a tribe in his homeland  he is at one with the land and its purpose  and does what he can to preserve it  The de facto leader of the group  he is the voice of reason that keeps the Planeteers in check when the group begins to lose faith in a given situation  Wheeler  voiced by Joey Dedio   From North America  specifically Brooklyn  NY   Wheeler controls the power of Fire  Wheeler is shown to be the least knowledgeable about earth preservation trends though this improves as the show goes on  in a way representing the oblivious aspect people have of the harm that they can cause to nature   He is the street smart comic relief for the group who  while having his heart in the right place  tends to get himself into tight spots when acting impulsively  fittingly  he is sometimes a  hothead   Throughout the series  he openly flirts with and tries to get closer to Linka  almost always having his advances shot down  Linka  voiced by Kath Soucie   From the Soviet Union  now Russia   Eastern Europe   Linka has the power of Wind  Linka closely studies bird life and  due to this  is extremely emotional when pollution harms them  Wheeler often tries to flirt with her  and despite more often than not shooting down these advances  is shown every now and again in her own way she too possesses feelings for him  She is a master of strategy and logic  as well as a computer expert  Gi  voiced by Janice Kawaye   Hailing from Thailand 10   Asia   Gi controls the power of Water  Gi is a self proclaimed marine biologist

varying self serving interests and backgrounds  they tend to work alone most of the time  Each of these villains represent a specific ecological disaster  These include  Hoggish Greedly  voiced by

albeit more malevolent and less of a harmless dunce  and with normal intelligence and lack of confusion at his surroundings  Like his good counterpart  Captain Pollution is voiced by David Coburn in both appearances  In the comic book version  Captain Pollution was created by Zarm   edit  Episodes Main article  List of Captain Planet episodes  edit   Mind Pollution  The episode titled  Mind Pollution   1991  was notable in that it did not deal with the environment  but rather with the issue of drug abuse  This was explained by the fact that the characters thought of drug addiction as  pollution of the mind   The episode revolved around an epidemic of a designer drug known as  Bliss  created by Verminous Skumm  It was also known for being quite a dark episode in the Captain Planet series  as it allowed a scene of Linka s cousin Boris bleeding from his arms after jumping through a window and dying from an overdose of the drug   edit   A Formula for Hate  The episode titled  A Formula for Hate   1992  was also unique for the series in that it did not deal with environmental pollution or destruction  It was also the first episode in an American children s animated series to directly deal with the AIDS HIV pandemic  12  In the episode  Skumm brainwashes a local community into thinking the virus can be spread through casual contact  and thus causing people to hate and fear a young man  infected with HIV  named Todd  voiced by Neil Patrick Harris  with his mother voiced by Elizabeth Taylor   edit  The New Adventures of Captain Planet The New Adventures of Captain Planet logo  The original series was the second longest running cartoon of the 1990s  producing 113 episodes  It lasted for three seasons under the name Captain Planet and the Planeteers  produced by TBS Productions and DiC   before many of the voice actors quit or were replaced and much licensing occurred  changing the title to The New Adventures of Captain Planet  produced by Hanna Barbera Cartoons  which was acquired by Turner in 1991   This series had noticeable differences from the original  such as episodes revealing more of the past of each of the characters  This does not directly contradict the first  but expands on it dramatically  Gi tells the story of her pet dolphin  while Linka is revealed to have a mining family who used canaries to detect lethal gases in the mines  and her opening sequence generalizes her birthplace as Eastern Europe to avoid confusion in viewers born after the Soviet Union s collapse in 1991  which would place her canonical birthplace among one of the countries that gained their independence when the Soviet Union collapsed   Dr  Blight  with a new voice actor  is revealed to have a sister who is a famous movie actress  Other changes were also noticeable  most significantly the animation style  While the character models from the DiC episodes were retained  and the original DiC opening sequence used  the new animation relied less on shading and was slightly more colorful  Many of the characters had refurbished outfits  The sound effects utilized when the Planeteers used their rings were changed and the echo in Captain Planet s voice when he emerged was gone  as well was the DiC seasons  use of a specific synth rock soundtrack  These tracks were replaced by a large number of orchestral pieces  although the famous end credits theme was retained  now showcasing footage from the Hanna Barbera episodes  A small number of cast changes occurred  affecting Gaia and most of the eco villains  similarly  the opening narration was voiced by David Coburn  Captain Planet  rather than LeVar Burton  Kwame   and was eventually replaced by a rap by Fred Schneider of The B 52 s   edit  Cast  edit  Heroes David Coburn as Captain Planet Whoopi

Tom Worrall  The ending theme  maintained by both DIC and Hanna Barbera s versions  is considered one of the most memorable parts of the series due to its catchy main chorus and rock track   Captain Planet  he s our hero  gonna take pollution down to zero    Its lyrics were written by show producer Nick Boxer 15  and is performed by Murray McFaden and Timothy Mulhollan   edit  Other media Pyle and Boxer demanded that the series  merchandise be made sustainably  because of this  several of the companies producing Captain Planet themed merchandise had to completely overhaul their means of production to manufacture recycled and recyclable products   edit  Toys As with many popular cartoons  Captain Planet had a line of action figures and vehicles  Released by Tiger Toys in 1990  the line ran for several years  long enough to tie into the New Adventures series  The toys were repackaged and sold by Grand Toys in Canada and Kenner throughout Europe  The toys were of average poseability  with the common five points   neck  shoulders  and hips  Finding a comprehensive list of what was released is difficult  since not all toys shown in the initial retailer catalog were even released  The collector s market is small  the toys being somewhat rare on eBay  The Captain Planet Foundation still sells a small number of them online  however  There may have also been further foreign variations of certain toys which may be even more difficult to catalog  Various toys from the New Adventures waves are not as likely to be well known  The five Planeteers  five Eco Villains  Commander Clash  and several versions of Captain Planet  each with a different gimmick or paint scheme  were released  along with several vehicles  A toy ring with lights and sound and interchangeable lenses for the five elements was also released  Four small vehicles were also sold through a Burger King promotion   edit  Comics Marvel Comics published a short run comic series to tie in to the show  however  the comics were a separate continuity  While not effectively part of the Marvel Universe  issue  4 s cover was a parody of the cover to Fantastic Four issue  1   edit  Video games A video game based on the series was developed for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Mindscape called Captain Planet  The game  which involved a good deal of shooting  received negative reviews from game critics and thus a Sega Mega Drive  Genesis  version of the game was canceled  A separate side scrolling game was developed by Novalogic for the Mega Drive Genesis  but only saw release in Europe and Australia  16  David Perry and Nick Bruty developed a ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC game using the license  a 3 level shoot  em up  A game was also released in 1990 for the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST  written by Tony Crowther  This was a platform game  and was briefly bundled with the Amiga 500  Cartoon Classics  pack released in 1991  1  A Commodore 64 game was in development but never released  Tiger Toys  owners of the action figure license  also created an LCD hand held game  In the video game Cartoon Network  Punch Time Explosion  Captain Planet appears as one of the unlockable characters in both Nintendo 3DS version and XL for Wii  PS3  and Xbox 360   edit  Home video Several VHS tapes were released  usually with a single episode each  A DVD with four episodes and bonus features exists but was only available as part of a  Planeteer Pack  purchased from the Captain Planet Foundation  17  The  Planeteer Pack  special is no longer available  Shout  Factory released a DVD set of the complete 1st Season on April 19  2011  The DVD packaging is made of 100  recycled paper  18   edit  Films  edit   Planet  Boxer and Pyle wrote a film adaptation of Captain Planet in 1996  originally titled Planet  Five years later  Michael Reaves revised the concept as Dark Planet  The storyline was darker than the series  and set in a post apocalyptic time period  However  the script was lost when Turner and Warner Bros  merged  19  20  The film reached the design stage before it was abandoned   edit  Cartoon Network In late 2007  it was reported that Turner was in talks regarding another film adaptation of the series  21  In early 2008 Warner Bros  rejected plans to produce the film  22  In July 2011  Cartoon Network and producers Don Murphy and Susan Montford began developing a live action film based on the series  23  24   edit  Legacy Captain Planet developed a large following during its initial run  creating an entire generation of eco literate youth and popularizing environmental concepts and vocabulary amongst children and young adults  citation needed  Executive producer Barbara Pyle  after years of being approached by now adult fans of the series  realized that if the fans of the series could be brought together to work in cooperation  they could cause positive change in the world  On September 15  2010  twenty years to the date of the pilot episode  Nathan Havey  Ian Storrar  Kristie Giannetto  Suzanne French and Kyle King  with the assistance of Pyle  launched the Planeteer Movement website and social media presence  which has now grown to a
